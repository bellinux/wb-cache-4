25|$|The {{traditional}} commentators do {{not necessarily}} explain mohar this way.

Rashi understands Rachel and Leah's complaint to Jacob ("we are considered strangers to him for he has sold us") as saying that it was not normal for a father to sell his daughters, at least not without also giving them a dowry.|$|E
25|$|The 'dependent arisings' have {{a causal}} conditioning, and thus Pratityasamutpada is the Buddhist belief that {{causality}} {{is the basis}} of ontology, not a creator God nor the ontological Vedic concept called universal Self (Brahman) nor any other 'transcendent creative principle'. However, the Buddhist thought does not understand causality in terms of Newtonian mechanics, rather it <b>understands</b> <b>it</b> as conditioned arising. In Buddhism, dependent arising is referring to conditions created by a plurality of causes that necessarily co-originate a phenomenon within and across lifetimes, such as karma in one life creating conditions that lead to rebirth in one of the realms of existence for another lifetime.|$|E

When Doniger calls Marek and asks him to pick his three best people to return to New Mexico, Marek chooses Stern {{to be part of the}} team.

25|$|An {{expression}} of intent inter presents becomes effective {{at the moment}} when the person to whom it is made <b>understands</b> <b>it</b> well. An {{expression of}} intent inter absents becomes effective {{at the moment when}} the notification of the expression reaches such other party, except when the withdrawal of the notification previously or simultaneously reaches such other party. The fact that after the notification of the expression the expresser dies, or becomes unable to make juridical acts, or is limited in capacity to make juridical acts, shall not null the expression of intent. In the interpretation of an expression of intent, the real intention of the parties must be sought rather than the literal meaning of the words. A person who offers to make a contract shall be bound by his offer except at the time of offer he has excluded this obligation or except it may be presumed from the circumstances or from the nature of the affair that he did not intend to be bound. Exposing goods for sale with their selling price shall be deemed to be an offer. However, the sending of pricelists is not deemed to be an offer. An offer ceases to be binding if it is refused. An offer made inter presentes ceases to be binding if it is not accepted at once.An acceptance which arrives late, except under the circumstances in the preceding article, shall be deemed to be a new offer.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} drum protocol, a drum may {{be thought}} of as a person or being and is to be regarded and respected as such. Drum etiquette is highly important. There are regional variations. The drum is the central symbol of Oklahoma pow wows and is located in the center of the dance floor and pow wow (which are themselves shaped in concentric circles). Southern drums are suspended by four posts, one for each direction. Northern drums are set up on the outside of the dance area, with the host drum in the best position. Drummer-singers are expected to remain at their drum and ready to sing at any moment's notice; a dancer might approach the drum and whistle, fan or gesture his staff over a drum to indicate his request for a song even if it is not that drum group's turn to sing. In some regions it is considered disrespectful to leave a drum completely unattended. Some drum groups do not allow females to sit down at their drum but welcome them to stand behind the drummers and sing backup harmonies; the reasons for this point vaguely to a variety of tribal stories that attempt to tell the history of drumming as each group <b>understands</b> <b>it.</b> People bring water to the drummers and generally assist the players as needed. (It is also considered a taboo among some nations to discuss spiritual teachings in writing or to name absolute authority in reference to spiritual teachings.) The drum is offered gifts of tobacco during giveaways and musicians acknowledge this by standing.|$|E

If Searle's room can't pass the Turing test then there is no other digital technology that could pass the Turing test.

[...] Most of the difficulties, according to Link, arise in addressing the second problem, [...] "where the impossibility of perfect answers spawns endless debate." [...] Almost always at the center is the letter-versus-spirit dilemma. [...] At the literalist extreme, efforts are made to dissect every conceivable detail about {{the language of the}} original Chinese poem. [...] "The dissection, though," [...] writes Link, [...] "normally does to the art of a poem approximately what the scalpel of an anatomy instructor does to the life of a frog." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alienation {{is a term}} {{philosophers}} {{apply to}} a wide variety of phenomena, including any feeling of separation from, and discontent with, society; feeling that there is a moral breakdown in society; feelings of powerlessness in the face of the solidity of social institutions; the impersonal, dehumanised nature of large-scale and bureaucratic social organisations. Kierkegaard recognizes and accepts the notion of alienation, although he phrases it and <b>understands</b> <b>it</b> in his own distinctly original terms. For Kierkegaard, the present age is a reflective age—one that values objectivity and thought over action, lip-service to ideals rather than action, discussion over action, publicity and advertising over reality, and fantasy over the real world. For Kierkegaard, the meaning of values has been removed from life, by lack of finding any true and legitimate authority. Instead of falling into any claimed authority, any [...] "literal" [...] sacred book or any other great and lasting voice, self-aware humans must confront an existential uncertainty.|$|E
