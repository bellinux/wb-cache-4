50|$|Although {{amplifier}} {{efficiency is}} good with this system, moving coil speakers operate at relatively low efficiency in the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequency</b> region. Thus the original {{aim of the}} method is defeated.|$|E
50|$|This method {{works with}} an {{ultrasonic}} transducer scanning the wafer bond. The reflected sound signal {{is used for}} the image creation. The lateral resolutions depends on the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequency,</b> the acoustic beam diameter and the signal-to-noise ratio (contrast).|$|E
50|$|By {{adjusting}} the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequency</b> of the device, {{it is possible}} to cut hard tissue while leaving soft tissue untouched by the process. The <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequency</b> is modulated from 10, 30, and 60 cycles/s (Hz) to 29 kHz. The low frequency enables cutting of mineralized structures, not soft tissue. Power can be adjusted from 2.8 to 16 W, with preset power settings for various types of bone density. The tip vibrates within a range of 60-200 µm, which allows clean cutting with precise incisions. A recent article on the topic of piezoelectricity has named piezoelectric surgery {{as one of the most}} important applications of this concept, in addition to medical ultrasound imaging.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{distinction between the}} two methods is that the cavitation effects in a megasonic bath are much less damaging than those found with <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequencies.</b> This significantly reduces or eliminates cavitation erosion and the likelihood of surface damage to the product being cleaned. Parts that would be damaged by <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequencies</b> or cavitation effects can often be cleaned without damage in a megasonic bath using the same solution.|$|R

50|$|The {{direct drive}} {{piezoelectric}} motor creates movement through continuous ultrasonic vibration. It's control circuit applies a two-channel sinusoidal or square wave to the piezoelectric elements {{that matches the}} bending resonant frequency of the threaded tube—typically an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequency</b> of 40 kHz to 200 kHz.

50|$|A {{ferromagnetic}} material {{will have a}} dimensional change when an external magnetic field is applied. This effect is called magnetostriction. The flux field of a magnet expands or collapses depends on the arrangement of {{ferromagnetic material}} having inducing voltage in a coil {{and the amount of}} change is affected by the magnitude and direction of the field. The AC current in the electric coil induces an AC magnetic field and thus produces magnetostriction at <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequency</b> in the material. The disturbances caused by magnetostriction then propagate in the material as an ultrasound wave.|$|E

50|$|Many flying mantids {{have evolved}} a highly {{sensitive}} ear which {{is capable of}} detecting <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequencies</b> emitted by bats using echolocation. These <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequencies</b> range from 60-120 kHz and once detected by the mantis, the mantis can change its flight path {{into a series of}} random loops and twirls to try to evade the bat. L. minor however does not have a highly specialized ear and can only hear best at 30-50 kHz. This is because the mantis no longer has to use its ear to detect bats, because it no longer has the ability to fly.|$|R
50|$|Sonication is {{the act of}} {{applying}} sound energy to agitate particles in a sample, for various purposes. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>frequencies</b> (>20 kHz) are usually used, leading to the process also being known as ultrasonication or ultra-sonication.|$|R
50|$|An {{ultrasonic}} humidifier uses {{a ceramic}} diaphragm vibrating at an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequency</b> to create water droplets that silently exit the humidifier {{in the form}} of cool fog. Usually the mist gets forced out by a tiny fan, while some ultra mini models have no fans. The models without fans are meant mainly for personal use. Ultrasonic humidifiers use a piezoelectric transducer to create a high frequency mechanical oscillation in a film of water. This forms an extremely fine mist of droplets about one micron in diameter, that is quickly evaporated into the air flow.|$|E
50|$|The bat echolocates using a rapid {{series of}} {{constant}} frequency pulses followed by longer frequency modulated sweeps, although contradictory estimates of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequency</b> and range {{have been reported}} in different studies. It was one of only a few bat species to use Doppler-shift compensatory behavior. As the bat flies through the air, the frequency of returning echoes changes due to Doppler shifting; Wagner's mustached bat is capable of changing the frequency of its emitted ultrasonic pulses to compensate for this effect. This helps it navigate easily while flying at relatively high speed through dense forest foliage.|$|E
5000|$|Microbubble gas core: The gas core is {{the most}} {{important}} part of the ultrasound contrast microbubble because it determines the echogenicity. When gas bubbles are caught in an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequency</b> field, they compress, oscillate, and reflect a characteristic echo- this generates the strong and unique sonogram in contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Gas cores can be composed of air, or heavy gases like perfluorocarbon, or nitrogen. [...] Heavy gases are less water-soluble so they are less likely to leak out from the microbubble leading to microbubble dissolution. [...] As a result, microbubbles with heavy gas cores last longer in circulation.|$|E

50|$|The {{twentieth century}} saw a burgeoning of {{technological}} {{applications of the}} large body of scientific knowledge that was by then in place. The first such application was Sabine’s groundbreaking work in architectural acoustics, and many others followed. Underwater acoustics was used for detecting submarines in the first World War. Sound recording and the telephone played important roles in a global transformation of society. Sound measurement and analysis reached new levels of accuracy and sophistication {{through the use of}} electronics and computing. The <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequency</b> range enabled wholly new kinds of application in medicine and industry. New kinds of transducers (generators and receivers of acoustic energy) were invented and put to use.|$|E
5000|$|Echogenicity can be {{increased}} by intravenously administering gas-filled microbubble contrast agent to the systemic circulation, with the procedure being called contrast-enhanced ultrasound. This is because microbubbles have {{a high degree of}} echogenicity. When gas bubbles are caught in an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequency</b> field, they compress, oscillate, and reflect a characteristic echo- this generates the strong and unique sonogram in contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Gas cores can be composed of air, or heavy gases like perfluorocarbon, or nitrogen. [...] Heavy gases are less water-soluble so {{they are less likely to}} leak out from the microbubble to impair echogenicity (McCulloch et al., 2000). Therefore, microbubbles with heavy gas cores are likely to last longer in circulation.|$|E
50|$|A sonotrode usually {{consists}} of a stack of piezoelectric transducers attached to a tapering metal rod. The end of the rod {{is applied to the}} working material. An alternating current oscillating at <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequency</b> is applied by a separate power supply unit to the piezoelectric transducers. The current causes them to expand and contract. The frequency of the current is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the tool, so the entire sonotrode acts as a half-wavelength resonator, vibrating lengthwise with standing waves at its resonant frequency. The standard frequencies used with ultrasonic sonotrodes range from 20 kHz to 70 kHz. The amplitude of the vibration is small, about 13 to 130 micrometres.|$|E
40|$|International audienceNew Brillouin {{scattering}} {{measurements of}} velocity and attenuation of {{sound in the}} hypersonic regime are presented. The data are analyzed together with the literature results at sonic and <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequencies.</b> As usual, thermally activated relaxation of structural entities describes the attenuation at sonic and <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>frequencies.</b> As already shown in vitreous silica, we conclude that the damping by network viscosity, resulting from relaxation of thermal phonons, {{must be taken into}} account to describe the attenuation at hypersonic frequencies. In addition, the bare velocity obtained by subtracting to the experimental data the effect of the two above mechanisms is constant for temperatures below 250 ~K, but increases almost linearly above, up to the glass transition temperature. This might indicate the presence of a progressive local polyamorphic transition, as already suggested for vitreous silica...|$|R
50|$|However, {{electronic}} filtering {{is inherently}} unable {{to solve this}} problem with the digital loudspeaker. The speaker elements must operate ultrasonically to avoid introducing (high levels of) audible artifacts, and this means ultrasonic airwaves are inevitable.
