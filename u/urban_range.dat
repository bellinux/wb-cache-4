50|$|The MOD II {{project in}} 1986 {{produced}} {{one of the}} most efficient automotive engines ever made. The engine reached a peak thermal efficiency of 38.5%, compared to a modern spark-ignition gasoline engine, which has a peak efficiency of 20-25%. The Mod II project replaced the normal spark-ignition engine in a 1985 4-door Chevrolet Celebrity notchback. In the 1986 MOD II Design Report (Appendix A) the results showed that highway gas mileage was increased from 40 to 58 mpg and achieved an <b>urban</b> <b>range</b> of 26 to(-) 33 mpg with no change in vehicle gross weight. Startup time in the NASA vehicle was a maximum of 30 seconds,while Ford's research vehicle used an internal electric heater to quickly start the engine, giving a start time of only a few seconds. The high torque output of the Stirling engine at low speed eliminated the need for a torque converter in the transmission resulting in decreased weight and transmission drivetrain losses negating somewhat the weight disadvantage of the Stirling in auto use. This resulted in increased efficiencies being mentioned in the test results.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Segmentation and {{classification}} of <b>urban</b> <b>range</b> data into different object classes have several challenges due to certain {{properties of the}} data, such as density variation, inconsistencies due to missing data and the large data size that require heavy computation and large memory. A method to classify urban scenes based on a super-voxel segmentation of sparse 3 D data obtained from LiDAR sensors is presented. The 3 D point cloud is first segmented into voxels, which are then characterized by several attributes transforming them into super-voxels. These are joined together by using a link-chain method rather than the usual region growing algorithm to create objects. These objects are then classified using geometrical models and local descriptors. In order to evaluate the results, a new metric that combines both segmentation and classification results simultaneously is presented. The effects of voxel size and incorporation of RGB color and laser reflectance intensity on the classification results are also discussed. The method is evaluated on standard data sets using different metrics to demonstrate its efficacy. Keywords: 3 D object...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Unprecedented {{amounts of}} 3 D {{data can be}} ac-quired in urban environments, but their use for scene un-derstanding is {{challenging}} due to varying data resolution and variability of objects in the same class. An additional challenge {{is due to the}} nature of the point clouds themselves, since they lack detailed geometric or semantic information that would aid scene understanding. In this paper we present a general algorithm for segmenting and jointly classifying object parts and the object itself. Our pipeline consists of local feature extraction, robust RANSAC part segmentation, part-level feature extraction, a structured model for parts in objects, and classification using state-of-the-art classifiers. We have tested this pipeline in a very challenging dataset that consists of real world scans of vehicles. Our contributions include the development of a segmentation and classification pipeline for objects and their parts; and a method for segmentation that is robust to the complexity of unstructured 3 D points clouds, as well as a part ordering strategy for the sequential structured model and a joint feature representation between object parts.

If the development of high-performance batteries continues as expected, advanced electric vehicles could have an <b>urban</b> <b>range</b> of over 150 miles and acceleration comparable to that provided by internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). And if optimistic battery cost, life, and performance goals are achieved, massproduced EVs will have lower life-cycle costs than comparable conventional gasoline vehicles. EVs will reduce emissions per mile of HC, CO. and NO,, compared to stringently controlled ICEVs. By the turn of the century, electric passenger vehicles could be viable as second cars in multicar households and in other limited markets. If an economical form of fast recharging is developed, the potential role of EVs will be much larger. No longer does successful commercialization depend on technical breakthrough...|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to the 1990 Clean Air Act, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) developed a compliance plan known as the Low Emission Vehicle Program. An integral part of that program was a sales mandate to the top seven automobile manufacturers requiring the percentage of Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) sold in California to be 2 % in 1998, 5 % in 2001 and 10 % by 2003. Currently available ZEV technology will probably not meet customer demand for range and moderate cost. A potential option to meet the CARB mandate is to use two Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) technologies, namely, zinc-air refuelable batteries (ZARBs) and electromechanical batteries (EMBs, i. e., flywheels) to develop a ZEV with a 384 kilometer (240 mile) <b>urban</b> <b>range.</b> This vehicle uses a 40 kW, 70 kWh ZARB for energy storage combined with a 102 kW, 0. 5 kWh EMB for power peaking. These technologies are sufficiently near-term and cost-effective to plausibly be in production by the 1999 - 2001 time frame for stationary and initial vehicular applications. Unlike many other ZEVs currently being developed by industry, our proposed ZEV has range, acceleration, and size consistent with larger conventional passenger vehicles available today. Our life-cycle cost projections for this technology are lower than for Pb-acid battery ZEVs. We have used our Hybrid Vehicle Evaluation Code (HVEC) to simulate {{the performance of the}} vehicle and to size the various components.

40|$|Changes {{in the use}} of land in the United States produce {{significant}} economic and environmental effects with important implications {{for a wide variety of}} policy issues, including protection of wildlife habitat, management of urban growth, and mitigation of global climate change. In contrast to previous descriptive and qualitative analyses of the trends in national land use, this paper uses an econometric approach to isolate the importance of historical changes in land-use profits and key government policies in determining national land-use changes from 1982 to 1997. The policies we examine are the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and total government payments to crop producers. We estimate a national-level discrete choice model of changes among the major land-use categories (crops, pasture, forest, <b>urban,</b> <b>range,</b> and CRP) with parcel-level observations of land use and land quality from the U. S. D. A. National Resources Inventory NRI) and measures of countylevel land-use net returns from a variety of sources. We then use fitted values from the econometric model to simulate land-use change from 1982 to 1997 under a series of factual and counterfactual scenarios that isolate the effects of different economic and policy factors. The simulations suggest how changes in economic returns and government policies have driven land-use changes in the past and will continue to affect nationwide land-use changes in the future. For example, we find that the introduction of the CRP and the decline in crop profits were the most significant explanatory factors driving the decline in cropland. Our results highlight some “unintended consequences” of government policies and the importance of net returns to a range of alternative land uses as determinants of land area change for each particular use. land use; econometric model; counterfactual simulation; Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) ...|$|E
40|$|Psychiatric {{emergencies}} {{are always}} indicated as a frequency of 10 % {{in the literature}} as the third-most frequent cause for the emergency surgeon employment. Investigations over possible regional thing in common or differences over frequency, value and therapy were so far only present in a case from the year 1995. Therefore the retrospective evaluation took place of 13. 251 emergency surgeon reports from the year 2005 of a medium sized German city, a district town and a municipality within a district to compare value, frequency and therapy of psychiatric emergencies. It {{has come to a}} rise of the psychiatric emergency situations of approximately 2 per cent on approximately 12 per cent within the last ten years. In addition the frequency of the psychiatric emergencies differs between urban and rural regions. On the country the psychiatric emergency occurs only half as frequently as in the urban areas. If one regards the kinds of the psychiatric emergencies, then differences and also thing in common show up. All emergency service regions are dominated by intoxications by alcohol, drugs and medicines, whereby the patients with the alcohol-conditioned intoxication represent the principal part. This group of patients is in the rural ranges above average frequently represented (75 % vs. 50 %), where going the intoxication through drug use (Aachen 26 %) and the intoxication by medicines (Aachen 14 %) dominates in the urban regions. Also more frequent in the urban region is the proportion of psychiatric emergencies with psychiatric diagnoses in the strict sense: psychosis, depression and mania. They are about twice as frequently as in the rural areas. The diagnoses suicide and suicide trial behave exactly in reverse. They are to be clearly more frequently found on the country than within the <b>urban</b> <b>range</b> (Düren + 11 % opposite Aachen). One finds the diagnosis withdrawal of alcohol, drugs and medicines in the rural regions not at all. Hardly regional differences show the excitation condition and the social crisis. These diagnoses employ the emergency services in city and country equally. Likewise the frequency of the psychiatric emergency per inhabitant lies on the average in the three examined regions with approximately 29 employments per 1000 inhabitants. No substantial regional differences resulted in the far investigation of the time spent of the emergency doctor {{at the scene of the}} psychiatric emergency. It oscillated within all ranges around the average value of 25. 7 minutes. In the comparison of this time with the period spent on other non-psychiatric emergencies it resulted that the psychiatric emergency binds the emergency surgeon less than other emergencies. If one examines the time staying on scene of the emergency surgeon after its technical disciplines, then no significant difference of the fields taken part in the emergency surgeon service results among themselves. During the investigation of the therapy of the psychiatric emergency in the individual emergency service regions it showed up that the treatment strategies within many regions are to be called only rudimentary and conditions of the today's emergency-medical standards is not. In regions in those the verbal basic crisis-intervention is not expressly forced of leading emergency surgeons, the basis crisis-intervention is only scarcely or not at all accomplished, although the investigations showed that this led to a significant reduction of the use of benzodiacepines. The psychiatric emergency patient profited thereby of a basis crisis intervention by the emergency surgeon like already 2002 demanded. This only succeeds naturally only, if the techniques are implemented in the curricula to the education of the emergency surgeons. A further point is nevertheless, then it seems, the uncritical and often not indicated use of the benzodiazepins. So often benzodiazepines are used, which do not become fair the respective situation of the psychiatric emergency and/or an evaluation of the patient later in the emergency admission by the psychiatrist no more to permit. This effected often in the absence of alternatives, is it in the bad training of the active emergency surgeons in the verbal basis crisis intervention, and in the limited selection of the medical concepts in the emergency service regions, which do not permit an employment of the substance classes on the respective psychiatric emergency. As conclusion it remains recording that the psychiatric emergency is in constant change of time and should be the subject of the current emergency-medical view, not least to get an important value in the emergency-medical training...|$|E
