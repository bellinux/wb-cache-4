5|$|The {{synthesis}} of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is {{introduced into the}} fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> linoleic acid {{as well as the}} triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of T-lymphocytes {{is dependent upon}} their ability to synthesize and secrete the cytokine, interleukin- 2, and to express cell surface receptors for interleukin- 2 and transferrin. We have previously reported that certain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> inhibit mitogen-stimulated T-lymphocyte proliferation. We now report that <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> decrease the concentration of interleukin- 2 in the culture medium of such cells by up to 45 %. This suggests that <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> inhibit lymphocyte proliferation by suppressing interleukin- 2 production. However, lymphocyte proliferation was only partially restored by addition of exogenous interleukin- 2 to cell culture medium {{in the presence of}} <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> indicating that these <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> also affect other processes involved in the control of proliferation. Saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> which also inhibit lymphocyte proliferation, did not affect the interleukin- 2 concentration in the culture medium suggesting a different mechanism for their action. Neither saturated nor <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> affected the expression of the interleukin- 2 receptor by mitogenstimulated lymphocytes. In contrast, <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> decreased expression of the transferrin receptor by up to 50 %. These observations suggest that the mechanism by which <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> inhibit lymphocyte proliferation involves suppression of interleukin- 2 production and of transferrin receptor expression. The mechanism for the inhibitory action of saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> is not clear...|$|R
40|$|Phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2; {{phosphatide}} 2 -acylhydrolase, EC 3. 1. 1. 4) {{activity from}} human platelets increases significantly when the enzyme {{is separated from}} an endogenous inhibitor(s). The inhibitor, associated mainly with a particulate fraction, has now {{been identified as a}} mixture of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Treatment of the inhibitor with trypsin, RNase, DNase, or heat did not diminish its inhibitory activity, which was extractable by organic solvents. Incubation of PLA 2 with phospholipids or various neutral lipids, including saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> had little or no effect on enzymatic activity. In contrast, <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> such as palmitoleic acid (16 : 1), oleic acid (18 : 1), linoleic acid (18 : 2), linolenic acid (18 : 3), arachidonic acid (20 : 4), all of which were detected in the particulate fraction, or longer chained <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> inhibited PLA 2 activity by 50 % at approximately equal to 5 X 10 (- 7) M. The level of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in the inhibitor fraction was equivalent to approximately equal to 10 (- 4) M, apparently sufficient to effectively inhibit PLA 2 activity. Methylation of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> caused a complete loss of inhibitory activity, and subsequent demethylation restored the activity, suggesting that a free carboxyl group was necessary. Inhibition of PLA 2 by <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> appeared to be noncompetitive. PLA 2 absolutely required Ca 2 + for activity; the inhibition by <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> was not reversed by Ca 2 +. The finding that <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are potent inhibitors of PLA 2 would explain its generally low activity in human platelet extracts and its marked increase of activity during the course of enzyme purification...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the level of d-biotin in the growth medium of Lactobacillus plantarum regulates the synthesis of apoacetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase; high levels cause repression, and deficient levels effect derepression. In this study, evidence has been obtained which suggests that coenzyme repression by biotin is an indirect effect; i. e., biotin regulates the synthesis of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> which are the true repressors of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase. This was observed in an experiment in which long-chain <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were added to media containing deficient, sufficient, or excess levels of d-biotin. In every case, independently of the biotin concentration for growth, the <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> caused a severe repression of the carboxylase. Saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were without effect. The level of oleic acid required to give maximal repression was 50 μg/ml. The free <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> had no adverse effect on the activity of the cell-free extracts nor on the permeation of d-biotin into the cell. Saturated and <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> decreased the rate of holocarboxylase formation from d-biotin and the apoacetyl-CoA carboxylase in the extracts. It is concluded that {{there are at least three}} mechanisms that control the acetyl-CoA carboxylase in this organism: (i) indirect coenzyme repression by d-biotin, (ii) repression by <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> and (iii) regulation of the activity of the holocarboxylase synthetase by both saturated and <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{results from}} the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> {{analysis}} are indicating that saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> lead to build-up of more energy-rich PHB in bacteria than with <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Traditionally the PHB synthesis mechanism {{has been described as}} a de novo route in which <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are transformed into acetyl-CoA by β-oxidation cycles (Rehm et al. 1998). It is possible that saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are more easily converted to acetyl-CoA than <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> However, in pure oil, heated oil and waste oil, there is an excess quantity of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> present.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The {{impact of}} dietary <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> on the {{development}} of cancers is highly controversial. We recently demonstrated that <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> trigger the downregulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN through an mTOR/NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism in hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated whether <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> promote hepatoma progression by downregulating PTEN expression. METHODS: The effects of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and PTEN-specific siRNAs on proliferation, invasiveness and gene expression were assessed using HepG 2 hepatoma cells. The tumor promoting activity of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> was evaluated in vivo using HepG 2 xenografts in nude mice. RESULTS: Incubation of HepG 2 cells with <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> or PTEN-specific siRNAs, increased cell proliferation, cell migration and invasiveness, and altered the expression of genes involved in inflammation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and carcinogenesis. These effects were dependent on PTEN expression levels and were prevented by mTOR and NF-kappaB inhibitors. Consistent with these data, the development and size of subcutaneous HepG 2 -derived tumors in nude mice xenografts were dramatically increased when mice were fed with an oleic acid-enriched diet, {{even in the absence of}} weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that dietary <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> promote hepatoma progression by reducing the expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN...|$|R
