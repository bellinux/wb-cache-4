5|$|From 1978 to 1981, Sai Tso Wan Landfill (晒草灣堆填區) served East Kowloon. Approximately 1.6million tonnes of {{domestic}} waste and commercial waste were {{dumped in the}} site during its four-year operation. The disposed waste stacked up to 65 metres high. After its closure in 1981, it was sealed with soil and planted over with Grasslands and trees. Sin Fat Road, which runs <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> hosts Sceneway Garden Minibus Terminus, was constructed. Sai Tso Wan Landfill was later rebuilt into Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground.|$|E
5|$|On 20 June, Company C, 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry (C/2-503) {{discovered}} {{the bodies of}} a Special Forces CIDG unit that had been missing for four days on Hill 1338, the dominant hill mass south of Dak To. Supported by A/2-503, the Americans moved <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> {{set up for the}} night. At 06:58 the following morning, Alpha Company began moving alone up a ridge finger and triggered an ambush by the 6th Battalion of the 24th PAVN Regiment. Charlie Company was ordered to support, but heavy vegetation and difficult terrain made movement extremely difficult. Artillery support was rendered ineffective by the limited range of visibility. Close air support was impossible for the same reasons. Alpha Company managed to survive repeated attacks throughout the day and night, but the cost was heavy. Of the 137 men that comprised the unit, 76 had been killed and another 23 wounded. A search of the battlefield revealed only 15 dead North Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of Magaw's outer lines {{to the south and}} east of the fort, the general American retreat towards the perceived safety of the fort took place. To the south, the third defensive line had never been completed so Cadwalader had nowhere left to retreat to except the fort. To the north, the riflemen under Rawlings still held, but barely, as there were fewer riflemen than before and because the increased amount of firing had jammed some of the men's weapons, some of the men were forced to push boulders down the hill at the attacking Hessians. The American battery at Fort Washington was silenced by Pearl. By this time, the riflemen's fire had almost ceased, and the Hessians slowly advanced <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> engaged the Americans in hand-to-hand fighting. Overpowering the Americans, the Hessians {{reached the top of the}} hill and swarmed into the redoubt with a bayonet charge, capturing it quickly.|$|E

60|$|Wild with {{excitement}} the boys {{made their way}} home; they rushed down the hill-sides, scrambled through the drifts in the bottoms, in which they sometimes disappeared altogether, and had to haul each other out, struggled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills,</b> <b>and,</b> panting and breathless, rushed in a body into Mr Humphreys' farmhouse, that standing nearest to them, {{on their way to}} Castleton.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{a man so}} {{hard and}} strong this fearful blow had fallen, and, to do him justice, he took it like a man. He wandered on and on {{for an hour or}} more, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills,</b> <b>and</b> into <b>the</b> forest, talking to himself.|$|R
25|$|The {{ship had}} been hauled {{from the nearby}} river <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> lowered into a {{prepared}} trench. Inside this, the helmet was wrapped in cloths and placed {{to the left of}} the head of the body. An oval mound was constructed around the ship. Long afterwards, the chamber roof collapsed violently under the weight of the mound, compressing the ship's contents into a seam of earth.|$|E
25|$|In 1872 a Congregational {{church was}} built about 30 chains nearer Raglan, on land {{originally}} {{taken up by}} W. Cogswell. A section of about 3 acres was acquired, running from {{the road to the}} top of the hill. It was built by Jim Pearce and Joseph Pretty. A scrub fire about 1904 quickly ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> <b>and</b> completely demolished the building. A 20 feet high stone cairn was built here in 1971.|$|E
25|$|On 8 May, Apology {{ran in the}} 1,000 Guineas Stakes {{against a}} field of nine horses. The race favourites were Apology, La Coureuse, and Lady Bothwell. At {{the start of the}} race, the runners broke evenly and {{continued}} in a line for the first 200 yards, when La Coureuse took the lead at the Bushes-hill. Apology took the lead on the ascent up the Abingdon Mile Bottom, overtaking the leaders halfway <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> winning the race by a margin of three quarters of a length. The second-place finisher La Coureuse and third place horse Blanchefleur were separated by the same distance.|$|E
60|$|A howl of dismay went <b>up</b> from <b>the</b> {{crowd as}} they saw Friesshardt raise his pike and bring it down with all his force on Tell's head. The sound of the blow went echoing through <b>the</b> meadow <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>and</b> down <b>the</b> valleys.|$|R
50|$|The road is irregularly U-shaped {{and almost}} encircles Government House. Starting from Lower Albert Road, <b>the</b> road winds <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>and</b> turns near <b>the</b> Consulate General of United States of America building. It intersects with Garden Road, Kennedy Road and Cotton Tree Drive.|$|R
50|$|From {{at least}} 1817 donkeys {{were used to}} carry {{visitors}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>and</b> by 1852 there were numerous donkey hire stands. One particular donkey named Old Moses carried a young Princess Victoria to St Ann's Well where she officially opened a new path from Nob's (now St Ann's) Delight to Foley Walk.|$|R
25|$|An {{orphaned}} French {{girl named}} Emilie, who {{lives at the}} farm with her grandfather, finds the two horses and takes care of them. German soldiers arrive and confiscate supplies from the property, even the jam that Emilie's grandfather makes, but Emilie hides the horses in her bedroom. Emilie suffers from a disease that makes her bones fragile and {{is not allowed to}} ride the horses for fear of falling. Nonetheless, Emilie's Grandfather, for her birthday, allows her to ride Joey. She gallops the horse <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> runs into the Germans who then take the horses, breaking Emilie's heart. The grandfather keeps the pennant.|$|E
25|$|The heavy oak vessel {{had been}} hauled {{from the river}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> lowered into a {{prepared}} trench, so only {{the tops of the}} stem and stern posts rose above the land surface. After the addition of the body and the artefacts, an oval mound was constructed, which covered the ship and rose above the horizon at the riverward side of the cemetery. The view to the river is now obscured by Top Hat Wood, but the mound would have been a visible symbol of power to those using the waterway. This appears to have been the final occasion upon which the Sutton Hoo cemetery was used for its original purpose.|$|E
25|$|Numbers of the Portuguese force were rapidly reduced {{before the}} Sinhalese army charged <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> {{attacked}} them. Rajasinghe conducted his troops {{during the battle}} from {{under the shade of}} a tree. The Portuguese force was almost completely destroyed in the fight that ensued. Approximately 4,000 soldiers of the Portuguese force were killed. Only 33 Portuguese soldiers were left alive, along with a number of mercenaries. Rajasinghe and Wijayapala ordered their men not to kill the survivors after the battle was won. Heads of the killed soldiers were piled before the Sinhalese king. A search was made for Melo's body, but it was not found. However, some Sinhalese soldiers found Melo's sword, and presented it to Rajasinghe.|$|E
50|$|The {{background}} {{documents to}} the route {{study indicate that}} it is predicted that the M1 {{will need to be}} upgraded to 3 lanes each way plus climbing lanes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>and</b> will still run out of capacity by 2021, at which time a type C corridor will be needed in addition to the type A tunnel currently proposed.|$|R

60|$|Among {{those who}} still kept <b>up</b> <b>the</b> search were several of the boys' school-fellows. They had not been {{permitted}} to join while the snow-storm continued, and were therefore fresh at the work. A party of four kept together, struggling through the deep snow-drifts, climbing <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills,</b> <b>and</b> enjoying <b>the</b> fun, {{in spite of the}} saddening nature of their errand.|$|R
25|$|Just then, {{disaster}} struck. Further {{south along}} the center of Bragg's line, Federal troops under General Thomas smashed through Confederate positions {{at the base of}} the ridge, sweeping <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> driving Bragg's men before them. With his army disintegrating before his eyes, Bragg ordered Cleburne to hold the Federals off long enough to let the rest of his men escape. The 33rd Alabama attacked approaching skirmishers in the gathering darkness, allowing the remainder of Bragg's army to cross Chickamauga Creek to the east, and retreat into Georgia. Since his forces had held more-or-less together during the rout, Cleburne now found his divisionincluding the 33rd Alabamaserving as the rearguard of the Army of Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|When the 7th Brigade {{withdrew from}} the hill, the {{artillery}} stopped and Syrian tanks mounted the hill to fire at them. Ben-Gal's 7th Battalion had only six tanks and was acting as a brigade reserve, Nafshi had six tanks, and the operations officer was patrolling Buq'ata for the commandos. Zamir was fighting on Tel Git and {{was running out of}} ammunition, so he asked for permission to withdraw and reload. Ben-Gal refused at first, but relented when he was told there was only one shell per tank. Ben-Gal consulted Eitan and decided to counterattack. The 7th Battalion began to move <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> saw the Syrian tanks. Kahalani called the other Israeli tanks behind the ramp and got little response, since they were from different units and were operating on different frequencies. The brigade communications officer cut into every company's net, but they still did not respond to Kahalani. Kahalani's gunner knocked out the Syrian tank {{at the top of the}} hill, and another one was hit by an Israeli tank from the rear of the ramp.|$|E
500|$|All {{the donkey}} handler did was laugh. Just as I turned round, the donkey's face was right {{by me and}} it shook its head and I stuck a punch in among it somewhere, and the donkey went down like it was shot ... much to my amazement. But not to as much amazement as the donkey handler's– [...] I've never seen a bloke sober up so quick. It was a hole in one: the donkey {{struggled}} to its feet and looked really willing to go <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> the donkey handler lost his laugh.|$|E

500|$|At about 16:00, [...] Ney {{decided to}} attempt to break the centre right of the Anglo-allied line with his cavalry. Some 4,800 French {{horsemen}} charged <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> into the allied infantry, who had formed themselves into squares to resist them. In all, 9,000 cavalry were involved in repeated attacks on the allied squares but were unable to break any of them, including the Brunswickers, who some British officers regarded as [...] "shaky". The Brunswick hussars and uhlans, who formed part of the 7th British Cavalry Brigade, made harrying attacks on the French whenever they retired to regroup. Eventually, Ney {{had no choice but}} to abandon the attacks.|$|E
500|$|The Residency was to {{the west}} of the Sitabardi hill, a [...] hillock running north-south. The British East India Company troops {{occupied}} the north end of the hillock. The Marathas, fighting with the Arabs, made good initial gains by charging <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> forcing the British to retreat to the south. British commanders began arriving with reinforcements: Lieutenant Colonel Rahan on 29 November, Major Pittman on 5 December, and Colonel Doveton on 12 December. The British counterattack was severe and Appa Saheb was forced to surrender. The British lost 300 men, of which 24 were Europeans; the Marathas lost an equal number. A treaty was signed on 9 January 1818. Appa Saheb was allowed to rule over nominal territories with several restrictions. Most of his territory, including the forts, was now controlled by the British. They built additional fortifications on Sitabardi hill.|$|E
500|$|Galland {{claimed his}} third Hurricane {{later that same}} day [...] over Tienen. He had long {{believed}} that his opponents had been Belgian, not knowing {{that all of the}} Belgian Air Force's Hurricanes had been destroyed {{on the ground in the}} first two days, without seeing combat. On 19 May, Galland shot down a French Potez aircraft. During this flight he ran out of fuel short of the runway and landed nearby, at the base of a hill. With the help of soldiers from a German Flak battery, he pushed the Bf 109 <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> then half-flew, half-glided down to the Charleville-Mézières airfield in the valley below. He sent back a can of fuel for his wingman, who had also landed short of the runway. He continued flying and the next day, claimed another three more aircraft, making a total of seven. For this he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class from Erhard Milch on 22 May.|$|E

500|$|The regiment's {{involvement}} in the attack on Beersheba began at 18:00 on 30 October, when the ANZAC Mounted Division set off along the Wadi el Imshash towards the village. By 08:00 the brigade had reached its starting position at Bir Salim Irgeig, ready to begin their assault on Tel el Saba. Moving around the open Turkish flank they managed to approach the mound from the east. The regiment were {{to the right of}} the brigade line with the Auckland Mounted Rifles on their left. The regiment intended to move around and outflank the Turkish position from the north. Once the assault started they slowly moved <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> <b>and</b> eventually they passed the Wadi Khalil and were able to engage the rear of the Turkish position. [...] Confronted by Turkish artillery and machine-gun fire coming from their north, they could advance no further. At 15:00 the Aucklanders managed to charge and capture the hill top. Elsewhere, Beersheba was captured following a mounted charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade. The regiment's casualties during the battle were one dead and six wounded.|$|E
500|$|No {{one in the}} Patriot army held command {{once the}} {{fighting}} started. Each detachment fought independently under the previously agreed to plan to surround and destroy the Loyalists. The Patriots crept <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> fired from behind rocks and trees. Ferguson rallied his troops and launched a desperate bayonet-charge against Campbell and Sevier. Lacking bayonets, the Patriots ran {{down the hill and}} into the woods. Campbell soon rallied his troops, returned to the hill, and resumed firing. Ferguson ordered two more bayonet charges during the battle. This became the pattern of the battle; the Patriots would charge up the hill, then the Tories would charge down the hill with fixed bayonets, driving the Patriots off the slopes and into the woods. Once the charge was spent and the Tories returned to their positions, the Patriots would reform in the woods, return {{to the base of the}} hill, and charge up the hill again. During one of the charges, Colonel Williams was killed, and Colonel McDowell was wounded. Firing was difficult for the Loyalists, since the Patriots constantly moved using cover and concealment to their advantage. [...] Furthermore, the downhill angle of the hill contributed to the Loyalists overshooting their marks.|$|E
