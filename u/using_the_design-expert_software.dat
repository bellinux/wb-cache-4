40|$|Tube {{hydroforming}} {{is one of}} {{the unconventional}} metal forming processes in which high fluid pressure and axial feed are used to deform a tube blank in the desired shape. However, production of bi-layered tubular components using this process has not been investigated in detail in spite of the large number of research studies conducted in this area. Bi-layered tubing can be useful in complex working environments as it offers dual properties that a single layer structure doesn’t have. Consequently, for wider implementation of this technology, a detailed investigation on bi-layered tube hydroforming is required. In this research, both single and bi-layered tube hydroforming processes were numerically modelled <b>using</b> <b>the</b> finite element method (ANSYS LS-DYNA). Experiments were conducted to check the numerical models validation. In addition, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>Design-Expert</b> statistical <b>software</b> has been employed along with the finite element modelling to attain a detailed investigation of bi-layered tube hydroforming in the X-type and T-type dies. The process outputs were modelled as functions of both the geometrical factors (tube length, tube diameter, die corner radius, and thicknesses of both layers.) and the process parameters (internal pressure coordinates, axial feed, and coefficient of friction.). Furthermore, the desirability approach was used in conjunction with the RSM models to identify the optimal combinations of each the geometrical factors and process parameters that achieve different objectives simultaneously. In addition, a different optimization approach that applies the iterative optimization algorithm in the ANSYS software was implemented in the process optimization. The finite element models of single and bi-layered tube hydroforming processes were experimentally validated. A comparison of both processes was carried out under different loading paths. Also, response surface modelling of the bi-layered tube hydroforming process outputs was successfully achieved, and the main effects and interaction effects of the input parameters on the responses were discussed. Based on the RSM models, the process was optimized by finding the inputs levels at which the desired objectives are satisfied.

The {{evolution of}} structures is strongly depended on pyrolysis parameters, i.e., precursor molarity, precursor flow rate, precursor injection/deposition time, and substrate temperature. Field-effect {{scanning electron microscope}} analysis, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate {{the properties of the}} synthesized nanostructures and to provide evidence for the structural changes according to the changes in the pyrolysis parameters. The optimum parameters to achieve maximum density and well-defined hexagonally shaped nanorods were a precursor molarity of 0.2  M, an injection flow rate of 6  ml/min, an injection time of 10  min, and a substrate temperature of 250 – 355  °C. Based on the experimental results, the response surface methodology (RSM) was used to model and optimize the independent pyrolysis parameters using the Box-Behnken design.

The focus of this research is to study jering (archidendron jiringa) seeds and their potential as a coagulant in the treatment of anaerobic POME. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> of synthetic coagulants in the industry has caused detrimental effects to the environment.

40|$|The Network Design Problem (NDP) {{is one of}} the {{important}} problems in combinatorial optimization. Among the network design problems, the Multicommodity Capacitated Network Design (MCND) problem has numerous applications in transportation, logistics, telecommunication, and production systems.

With binary flow variables or unsplittable MCND, the complexity of the problem is increased significantly. With growing complexity and scale of real world capacitated network design applications, metaheuristics must be developed to solve these problems.

40|$|Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), {{a plastic}} polymer {{composed}} of ∼ 43 % hydrocarbon by weight and ~ 57 % chlorine has become extensively {{used in our}} daily lives. However, the disposal of waste PVC plastics presents serious problems. The increased awareness of these problems requires {{the development of a}} reliable technique to dispose of these wastes in a safe and environmentally benign way that is devoid of the formation/release of organo-chlorine compounds. Chemical degradation of PVC is a technology that transforms PVC waste into completely new chemical products that don't contain chlorine. Sub-critical water (SCW) treatment {{is one of the most}} reliable technologies since SCW as a chemical reaction medium having adjustable physico-chemical properties. Hydrodechlorination (HDC), a reaction that replaces organically bound chlorine by hydrogen, can be accelerated by the presence of metal oxide catalysts (alumina supported palladium, Pd 0 /Al 2 O 3) or raney nickel. When combined with SCW treatment, HDC offers a disposal process that is free from unwanted by-products. The rate of borohydride decomposition is accelerated by raney nickel. The HDC efficiency of virgin and formulated PVC in SCW under various reaction conditions of time and temperature was evaluated systematically. The time of reaction was varied from 1 to 4. 5 hours and the temperature was varied from 150 to 280 °C in the presence of palladium on alumina (Pd/Al 2 O 3) or raney nickel. The efficiency of HDC varied from ~ 3 % up to a completed dechlorination. Thus, organically bound chlorine in PVC in a water phase can be converted, virtually quantitatively, to chloride ion. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used for experimental design and data analysis.
