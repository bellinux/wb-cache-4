40|$|Mycelial {{expansion}} and fruit body development of caterpillar fungi, Cordyceps sobolifera(Hill.) Berk. et Br. was examined on various carbon and nitrogen sources, some substrates with various supplements. Best temperature for the mycelial expansion was 25 oC, while optimal pH was 7. Glucose and polypeptone {{were the best}} sources of carbon and nitrogen, respectively, as well as 1 : 1 was the best ratio of carbon and nitrogen. The <b>unpolish</b> rice and bean curd lees were used as core substrates combined individually with five various supplements. In substrates based, all the supplements with all combinations were found to exhibit the mycelial growth and fruit body formation. Likewise, yolk was found as a superior supplement and also clarified quite high polysaccharide content in the fruit body...|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} effects of the polishing and finishing of dental amalgam in relation to its marginal breakdown. The study was also conducted to make a clinical comparison of the marginal integrity of Dispersalloy restorations as compared to Twentieth Century Fine Cut Alloy restorations in both the polished and unpolished state. Forty patients with a total of 131 Class I amalgam restorations were used as the study group. The two alloy systems and polish or <b>unpolish</b> techniques were selected from a random table. Photographic evaluation of the restorations was used to judge the degree of marginal breakdown. The results of the study at the one-year evaluation show two main findings: (1) the Dispersalloy restorations showed less marginal breakdown than the Twentieth Century Fine Cut Alloy restorations, and (2) there was no significant difference between the polished and unpolished restorations overall...|$|E
