40|$|The impact phase during {{walking is}} {{sometimes}} characterised by an early loading peak, termed 'transient', {{followed by a}} brief decline in the force profile, termed 'unloading phase'. It was hypothesized that transients occur more frequently when subjects are unaware of the landing condition, and that the <b>unloading</b> <b>phase</b> represents a yield of the leg. This was tested experimentally by introducing an unexpectedly lowered or level support surface height during walking. Furthermore, associations between the <b>unloading</b> <b>phase</b> and type of foot placement, load-rate, kinesiology and centre of pressure were investigated. The transient occurred more frequently when subjects were unaware of the surface height. The amplitude of unloading was higher in flatfooted (combined), as compared to heel and toe landings. The percentage of combined landings, {{as well as the}} amplitude and duration of unloading were highest in the first unexpected level trials (UL 1) and gradually decreased in the subsequent level trials, when subjects adapted to the situation. Following the UL 1 <b>unloading</b> <b>phase,</b> the foot roll-off was halted, the ipsilateral knee flexed, the onset of the contralateral swing phase was delayed, and the double support phase increased. The unloading amplitude correlated significantly with the load-rate and knee flexion.

In this study, we analyzed whether and how foot-floor interface characteristics influence the gait initiation process. For this purpose, 25 undergraduate students were evaluated while performing a gait initiation task in three experimental conditions: barefoot on a hard surface (barefoot condition), bare-foot on a soft surface (foam condition), and shod on a hard surface (shod condition). Two force plates were used to acquire ground reaction forces and moments for each foot sepa-rately. A statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis was performed in COP time series.

40|$|Objectives: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the in vitro effects of fluoride solutions with different acidities on load-deflection characteristics of nickel-titanium (NiTi) orthodontic wires. Materials and Methods: In this study, which lasted 30 days, 36 (3 cm long, 0. 016 × 0. 022 inches, SENT 1622, G & H wire Company, Greenwood, Indiana, USA) NiTi wires, were divided into three experimental groups of 12 each. Two groups were subjected to 0. 05 topical fluoride mouthwash with different acidities (G 1, pH 4; G 2, pH 6. 6) for 90 s, twice a day, and kept in normal saline after that. The third group (G 3, the control group) was kept in normal saline only. Load and unload forces were measured with three bracket bending test in a universal testing machine (Testometric Co, Rochdale, UK). Loading and unloading plateaus and hysteresis were also recorded. Data were then analyzed using analysis of variance and honestly significant difference Tukey at P < 0. 05. Results: During the loading phase, {{there was a significant}} difference between deflections (P < 0. 001); but there was no interaction effect (P = 0. 191) and no significant difference among three groups (P = 0. 268). In the <b>unloading</b> <b>phase,</b> {{there was a significant difference}} between deflections (P < 0. 001) and an interaction effect was also observed (P = 0. 008). Further, significant differences noted among three groups (P = 0. 037).
