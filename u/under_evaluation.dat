On 5 April both of U-1s electric motors were damaged in a flooding incident during her trials. U-1s gasoline engines {{were never able to}} meet the speed called for in the contract during the Navy evaluations, and were considered not suitable for wartime use. As a result, the Navy only paid for U-1s hull and armament, and arranged a lease of the gasoline engines while replacement diesel engines were ordered from the Austrian firm Maschinenfabrik Leobersdorf. Despite the engine problems, U-1 and her sister ship had the best performance in diving and steering amongst the U-boats <b>under</b> <b>evaluation</b> by the Navy.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, a transfer might be included between here and the 42nd Street station on that line. Currently, the transfer is <b>under</b> <b>evaluation.</b> The transfer passageway would run under 42nd Street between Second Avenue and Third Avenue, connecting with the IRT Flushing Line station. Up to four properties might need to be required for the necessary ancillaries and emergency exits to built. The passageway would run under the northern side of 42nd Street, and the exit at the eastern end would be on the northwestern corner of that street and Second Avenue. Under a plan for the line in the 1990s, a spur to Grand Central Terminal was considered, which would have run via 44th Street as a way to divert riders from the , which run express on the Lexington Avenue Line. Service on this spur could not be as frequent as that on Lexington Avenue as there would not be enough capacity on Second Avenue, and as a result this plan was dropped.|$|E
25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} theory {{can be applied}} to all four areas of the marketing mix. Assessments are made by a decision maker on the probabilities of events that determine the profitability of alternative actions where the outcomes are uncertain. Assessments are also made for the profit (utility) for each possible combination of action and event. The decision maker can decide how much research, if any, needs to be conducted in order to investigate the consequences associated with the courses of action <b>under</b> <b>evaluation.</b> This is done before a final decision is made, but {{it should be noted that}} in order to do this costs would be incurred, time used and may overall be unreliable. For each possible action, expected profit can be computed, that is a weighted mean of the possible profits, the weights being the probabilities. The decision maker can then choose the action for which the expected profit is the highest. The theorem provides a formal reconciliation between judgment expressed quantitatively in the prior distribution and the statistical evidence of the experiment.|$|E

Lazy evaluation does not evaluate function arguments unless their values are required to evaluate the function call itself.|$|R
50|$|Informally, {{the truth}} value 1 {{represents}} full {{truth and the}} truth value 0 represents full falsity; intermediate truth values represent intermediate degrees of truth. Thus a formula is considered fully true <b>under</b> an <b>evaluation</b> e if e(A) = 1. A formula A {{is said to be}} valid in an MTL-algebra L if it is fully true <b>under</b> all <b>evaluations</b> in L, that is, if e(A) = 1 for all evaluations e in L. Some formulae (for instance, p → p) are valid in any MTL-algebra; these are called tautologies of MTL.|$|R

2500|$|Many prescribers {{lack the}} {{digitized}} information systems that reduce prescribing errors. To reduce these errors, some investigators have developed modified prescription forms that prompt the prescriber {{to provide all}} the desired elements of a good prescription.

Such forms are thought to reduce errors, especially omission and handwriting errors and are actively <b>under</b> <b>evaluation.</b> (See: Kennedy AG, Littenberg B.

Fa'iz El-Ghusein, the Kaimakam of Kharpout, wrote in his book, that according to the Ottoman official statistics there were about 1.9 million Armenian's in the Ottoman Empire. Another indication that other statistics might have existed is that Polybius in his book published in 1919, refer to a said “Ottoman Official Census of 1910.” The Turkish historian Dr. Secil Akgun, claimed: “The Ottomans do not have a definite number. That is, we have in our hands contradictory numbers regarding the Armenian population within the borders of the Ottoman Empire. I would think that Basmacıyan gives the most accurate number. This is to be between two and three million.” ...|$|E
