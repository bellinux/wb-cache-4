50|$|This design {{relies on}} the {{evaporative}} process of water to cool the incoming air while simultaneously increasing the relative humidity. A saturated filter is placed at the supply inlet so the natural process of evaporation can cool the supply air. Apart from the energy to drive the fans, water is the only other resource required to provide conditioning to indoor spaces. The effectiveness of evaporative cooling is largely dependent on the humidity of the outside air; dryer air produces more cooling. A study of field performance results in Kuwait revealed that power requirements for an evaporative cooler are approximately 75% less than the power requirements for a conventional packaged <b>unit</b> <b>air-conditioner.</b> As for interior comfort, a study found that evaporative cooling reduced inside air temperature by 9.6 °C compared to outdoor temperature. An innovative passive system uses evaporating water to cool the roof so that major portion of solar heat does not come inside.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Recessed spaces outside {{high-rise}} {{residential buildings}} of public-type in Hong Kong often contain {{a large number}} of condenser <b>units</b> of window-type <b>air-conditioners</b> that during summer reject heat into this space at the same time. For four condenser units per story, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code is used to predict temperature and flow fields inside the recessed spaces that differ in heights and condenser-unit locations. The results show that a powerful rising hot air stream and one vortex pair are formed in the space near to its corner wall. In addition, the results show that condenser units will suffer more when they are placed inside the taller recessed space, and at locations higher at this space and nearer to its corner wall. Then, these units would draw less air at an elevated temperature, and therefore become less energy efficient and de-rated in output capacity and sometime have interrupted operation. However, the condenser units at lower levels may benefit because they will draw more air at nearly environmental temperature. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

30|$|PeakSmart air-conditioner {{as part of}} {{positive}} payback program {{is an example of}} successful demand response program being implemented in Queensland. Currently, there are 4 ranges of the demand meter in Queensland: ① low, up to 1999  MW; ② moderate, from 2000 to 2999  MW; ③ high, from 3000 to 3999  MW; ④ extreme, above 4000  MW [39]. PeakSmart <b>air-conditioner</b> <b>units</b> operate when peak demand on network rises above 3000  MW. There are 3 DRMs for air-conditioners, depending on how extreme the need for demand management becomes. Compressor gets off in DRM 1. Air conditioning unit is capped to operate at 50 % in DRM 2 while in DRM 3, it is capped to operate at 75 %. PeakSmart demand management solutions rely on audio frequency load control (AFLC) system, which operates by the injection of a high frequency (1042 Hz) coded signal onto the high voltage network at substations, to send signals to participating households. All PeakSmart air-conditioners are equipped with a signal receiver. A signal is sent remotely from the operator via power supply that tells the air-conditioner to cap its energy consumption on occasions when the network reaches peak demand [39]. Another successful example is 770000 residential customers hot water systems connected to a controlled load tariff in Queensland. Load control of hot water reduces peak demand [40] and can be used to increase load during the day to absorb solar PV output.|$|R

The discharge angle for the supply grill of the AC unit was varied from 20 to 40 degrees. The position of the air conditioner was also varied and studied at 60 %, 75 % and 90 % of the total height of the room. In addition, the location of the occupant within the office room was varied, two locations were studied, one where the occupant is far from the unit and the other to closer to the AC unit at the middle of the room. Predictions of the air movement, room temperature, room relative humidity, comfort level, and distribution of contaminants within the office room are shown.

Waste minimisation {{involves}} reducing waste (emissions, effluent, solid waste) in companies, at source. v 7, 8 Its benefits include cost savings, environmental improvement, increased throughput {{and risk}} and liability reduction. 7, 8, 13 Through {{implementation of a}} structured waste minimisation programme, companies can identify waste minimisation opportunities: broad focus areas that will benefit from a more detailed waste minimisation assessment. More specific waste minimisation solutions can then be identified. In this study, the waste minimisation opportunity was identified by the company, Ben Booysen, a priori. Ben Booysen is a local air-conditioning and refrigeration company in Pietermaritzburg, which services <b>air-conditioner</b> <b>units.</b> They identified the waste minimisation opportunity of optimising the process conditions for cleaning the airconditioner units. At the time at Ben Booysen, Alukleen, an acid cleaner (RT Chemicals®, RTCM 64), was applied manually (by a paintbrush) at an effective dilution of 1 : 3 to clean the aluminium air-conditioner coils. Handy Andy and green soap were used to clean the plastic covers of the units. Concerns about the effluent, cost and safety of handling Alukleen led to their identification of this waste minimisation opportunity. The initial objectives of this project were thus the qualification and quantification of the species present in Alukleen; the quantification of the species present in the Ben Booysen effluent and the subsequent comparison of these values to limits for disposal to stormwater and Darvill. A further objective was the optimisation of the cleaning system with regard to Alukleen concentration and contact (soaking) time. Wet chemical analysis was employed as a qualitative tool for identification of the components present in Alukleen. This analysis indicated that fluoride, sulfate, sulfide, arsenite and chloride ions are present in Alukleen. Further quantitative analysis using the Ion chromatograph, the ICP-OES and a fluoride ion selective electrode indicated that only sulfate (152600 ppm) and fluoride (25400 ppm) are present in significant quantities. Studies were conducted on aluminium coil pieces in which both the contact (soaking) times and Alukleen concentrations were varied. These tests indicated {{that the effect of}} soaking time on the cleanliness achieved was negligible. Although a greater amount of dirt was removed when using more concentrated Alukleen solutions, etching of the metal occurred at higher concentrations, resulting in a loss of sheen and malleability of the metal. Etching of the aluminium air-conditioner coils by Alukleen, as indicated by both digital photography and electron microscopy, resulted in extending the objectives of this project to include the investigation of alternative aluminium cleaners. Hence, the cleaning action of three degreasers was investigated: Powerkleen (RT Chemicals®, RTCMI 23), Technicians' Choice (Auto Brite (PTY) Ltd.) and Klengine (Auto Brite (PTY) Ltd.). Powerkleen was found to be the most effective degreaser and did not compromise the metal's sheen or malleability. Further studies were then conducted to characterise the major components ofPowerkleen and to optimise its use with regard to concentration and contact (soaking) time. The suitability oftwo methods of application was also tested. The main component of Powerkleen, determined through the use of ICP-OES, was found to be potassium hydroxide, present at a concentration of 0. 711 M. The optimum Powerkleen concentration range for cleaning the aluminium coils was found to be between a 1 : 20 and 1 : 40 dilution. Contact (soaking) time of Powerkleen with the aluminium coils was found to have a negligible effect on the mass of dirt removed by the degreaser. Application of the Powerkleen to the aluminium coils by an air gun at a pressure of 4 bars (for units serviced at Ben Booysen) and by a pump bottle (for units serviced in industry) were both found to achieve an acceptable degree of cleanliness of the aluminium. A feasibility analysis (technical, economical and environmental) indicated that a 1 : 40 dilution of Powerkleen is a feasible, cost-effective and environmentally compliant alternative to Alukleen. Implementation of the Powerkleen cleaning system would result in a R 5030 annual saving with a payback period of 5. 9 months and an internal rate of return of 214. 9 %. It would further eliminate the fluoride effluent problems associated with Alukleen and reduce the quantity of chemical raw materials required for the process from 2100 Llannum to 260 Llannum. In industry, an effective dilution of 1 : 39 would be used for the sake of eas y dilution. A 1 : 79 dilution of Powerkleen was also found to be a feasible replacement for Handy Andy and green soap in the cleaning of the plastic covers of the units...|$|R
