50|$|The Hutchinson Family Singers were an American family singing {{group who}} became the most popular American entertainers of the 1840s. The group sang in four-part harmony a {{repertoire}} of political, social, comic, sentimental and dramatic works, and are {{considered by many to}} be the first <b>uniquely</b> American <b>popular</b> music performers. The group formed in the wake of a string of successful tours by Austrian singing groups such as the Tyrolese Minstrels and when American newspapers were demanding the cultivation of native talent. John Hutchinson orchestrated the group's formation with his brothers Asa, Jesse, and Judson Hutchinson in 1840; the Hutchinsons gave their first performance on November 6 of that same year. Jesse Hutchinson quit the main group to write songs and manage their affairs; he was replaced by sister Abby Hutchinson.|$|R
50|$|After Mr. Daly's {{death in}} 1899 she came under Charles Frohman's {{management}} {{and later became}} a member of Annie Russell's company. On October 24, 1904, at the New Lyceum Theatre, Mrs. Gilbert made her first appearance as a star, being then in the eighty-second year of her age, in a play, by Clyde Fitch, called Granny with a young Marie Doro in one of her earliest roles. Granny was announced as her farewell role and she read a special poem composed by Fitch {{at the end of each}} performance. Her final New York appearance occurred at the Lyceum on November 12, 1904. She acted for fifty-four years (after five years as a dancer), and she remained in active employment to the last. Mrs Gilbert was <b>uniquely</b> respected and <b>popular,</b> both with audiences and behind the footlights. She performed last on December 1 three days after Granny opened in Chicago, and died there on the following day from a brain hemorrhage.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This study {{investigated}} the nature and scope of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) content on a popular microblogging website Tumblr; as well a preliminary investigation of the motivations for interacting with NSSI content on Tumblr. Methods: Content analysis of 150 self-injury posts resulted {{in the identification of}} themes: melancholic, emotional expression, descriptions of cutting and self-injury. This was followed by notable frequencies of encouraging, supportive, and information providing content. Results: Motivation for website interaction was examined through a survey of 4 male, 27 female, and 5 other gender participants. ‘Reflects state of mind’ was the most reported motivation for interaction with negative content. Content discussing emotional expression appears <b>uniquely</b> <b>popular</b> on Tumblr. Conclusions: Content on Tumblr that is categorised as NSSI-related consists of posts that are both concerning and encouraging. High frequencies of information, supportive, and encouraging content suggests that an effective informal support system may be available via this community. However, in the same instance, large amounts of negative, emotional, and potentially triggering content may be detrimental to those considering or already engaging in NSSI behaviour. Social contagion theory suggests that the easy accessibility to such content may be potentially harmful. Tumblr users appear to be motivated by personal reflection and attempts to communicatewith negative content. Further research is necessary to determine this motivation in more detail...|$|E
40|$|THESIS 8003 This {{dissertation}} focuses primarily {{upon the}} practice of pilgrimage ex patria (?[away] from one?s country?), the act of abandoning one?s homeland, usually permanently, {{for the sake of}} God, a practice that was <b>uniquely</b> <b>popular</b> among the early medieval Irish. The origins of the medieval ideal of pilgrimage ex patria lie in the biblical, exegetical and monastic sources of the early Christian and late antique periods, which {{by the beginning of the}} fifth century had amalgamated to form a coherent ideal, and shortly thereafter, a formulaic devotional act. This study begins with an in-depth discussion of what ?pilgrimage? meant: it is a complex and multi-layered concept. The two chapters of Part I address the development of a coherent ideal of peregrinatio in a Christian context: Chapter one examines the Latin terms peregrinus, peregrinatio and peregrinari (?pilgrim/stranger?, ?pilgrimage/journey? and ?to travel/to be a stranger?); chapter two reveals how these words became attached to both a spiritual ideal of Christian alienation and an actual, physical ritual of devotion. The three chapters of Part II then explore the manifestations of peregrinatio in early medieval Ireland. Chapter three begins with an analysis of the scriptural and excgetical sources that were demonstrably available to the Irish, and proceeds to explore the ideological underpinnings of actual practiccs of devotional separation in Ireland, from the idealised Christian embodiment of spiritual alienation?ascetic monasticism?to the more problematic topic of Irish pilgrimage ad loca sancta. Chapter four then describes the social, legal and cultural contexts of these acts of pilgrimage?and includes a short discussion of gender?in early medieval Ireland, and the peculiarities and innovations to which these contexts contributed...|$|E
