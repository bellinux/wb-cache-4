Massive efforts {{have been put in}} the optimal design of lithium ion batteries with the assistance of simulation models. But to our knowledge, the application of multi-objective optimization in this process has not been well discussed. The purpose of this thesis is to study the multi-objective optimization problems that could be applied on the optimal design of lithium ion batteries with the assistance of simulation models. A two-objective problem is firstly constructed with the performance measures of energy per <b>unit</b> <b>separator</b> area for the discharge rate of 0. 5 C and the mass per <b>unit</b> <b>separator</b> area. The reaction zone model and genetic algorithm are employed to solve this problem qualitatively. The resulted Pareto front comes out to be a concave curve in the 2 D plane of the two performance measures. Three case studies are guided to illustrate the advantages and applications of employing the multi-objective optimization in the design process. A DAE based simulation model is then employed and tuned to have a satisfying fit to the charge and discharge curves for the cycling rates up to 4 C. With the assistance of this precise simulation model, the properties of the Pareto front of the two-objective optimization is then validated quantitatively. A three-objective optimization problem with the objectives of energy performance of 0. 25 C and 4 C discharge and mass performance is then constructed to extend the analysis of applications of multi-objective oriented studies in lithium-ion battery designs. The problem is quantitatively resolved {{with the assistance of the}} DAE based simulation model and genetic x algorithm. The Pareto front comes out to be a curved surface in the 3 D space of the three objectives. The properties of the Pareto front are expected to offer perspectives and references to product designs in the industry...|$|E

40|$|Selection of {{the optimum}} {{dimensions}} for cross flow pneumatic classifier for grains is very essential. The study reveals {{the use of}} predicted particle trajectory in selecting the dimensions of such classifiers in the x and y planes. Drag and gravitational forces were resolved in 2 D and the acceleration components integrated twice. The resulting displacement equations were solved numerically with MATLAB 3. 1 software using FORTRAN 77. The plot of particle trajectory were also obtained and used as guide for selecting the length and breadth of a separation chamber. The separation chamber was fabricated based on the particle trajectory obtained and tested with threshed cowpea discharged from a thresher unit. It was found that maximum displacement of grains under {{the condition of the}} experiment does not go beyond the boundaries of the <b>separator</b> <b>unit</b> fabricated. Also, in all the experimental cases, almost all the light materials were blown outside the separator chamber. These indicate that the theoretical particle trajectory produced from the MATLAB could be an appropriate parameter for selecting the length and breadth of a <b>separator</b> <b>unit.</b> Particle trajectory is therefore proposed as a tool for selecting the dimensions of cross flow pneumatic classifiers...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe present paper aims at {{proposing a}} {{complementary}} view of process intensification (PI) {{based on the}} concepts of local intensification and global intensification. Local intensification is defined here as the classical approach of PI based {{on the use of}} techniques and methods for the drastic improvement of the efficiency of a single unit or device. Some examples are given to illustrate that local process intensification presents several limitations when compared to holistic overall process-based intensification, named global intensification. Indeed, when PI focuses on single <b>units</b> (reactors, <b>separators,</b> hybrid separators, etc.), the strong interactions among all units within the process are ignored and the impact of local intensification of a single unit can be very limited, resulting in weak improvement of the whole process.

50|$|During {{the wash}} cycle, the chamber is filled {{approximately}} one-third full of solvent {{and begins to}} rotate, agitating the clothing. The solvent temperature is maintained at 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), as a higher temperature may damage it.

This {{is known as the}} cycle and is continued for the wash duration. The solvent is then removed and sent to a distillation unit consisting of a boiler and condenser. The condensed solvent is fed into a <b>separator</b> <b>unit</b> where any remaining water is separated from the solvent and then fed into the 'clean solvent' tank.

30|$|On {{production}} <b>units,</b> a multiphase <b>separator</b> is {{the first}} surface equipment {{which is used to}} separate the produced wellhead fluid into the liquid and gas fractions. Inappropriate design of three-phase separators is a major obstacle to stable hydrocarbon processing and leads to reduce the efficiency of the entire surface equipment such as: heaters, exchangers and pressure maintenance equipment. When sizing a horizontal separator, it is necessary to choose a seam to seam vessel length and a diameter (Stewart and Arnold 2008). In the semiempirical method, the separator length and diameter are chosen, in order to allow different phases to separate from each other and reach an equilibrium. Much work has been conducted to investigate the aspects of designing three-phase separators (GPSA 1998; Smith 1987; Gerunda 1981 and Watkins 1967). Bothamley (2013 a, b, c) conducted a complete study for quantifying the separation performance. The effects of different types of momentum breaker and mist extractor device, feed pipe velocity, particle-size distribution and the main vessel dimensions were discussed in their work.|$|R

Space- and weight challenges are given priority, {{and the size of the}} capture installations will be of importance when selecting capture technology rather than process efficiency alone. In this work, CO 2 capture from an FPSO turbine exhaust gas using a supersonic separator is investigated. To assess the operational performance of the capture process, a Laval nozzle (converging- diverging geometry) model is implemented and successfully integrated in a steady-state process flow sheet simulator. The model includes equilibrium thermodynamics describing freeze-out of dry ice from a gas mixture containing CO 2. To determine under which conditions this process is thermodynamically and fluid dynamically feasible, different boundary conditions are explored. By integrating the supersonic <b>separator</b> <b>unit</b> in a flow sheet model, the interaction between the capture and the rest of the process is studied.

The delithiation of LiFePO 4 to FePO 4, which can be reversed and cycled, is a heterogeneous two-phase solid-state reaction that can be summarized as LiFePO 4 FePO 4 + Li+ + e–. Along with these major advantages, LFP also shows some unfavorable properties. The flat profile during discharge makes {{the assessment of the}} state-of-charge (SOC) diffi-cult. Furthermore, the cell voltage depends on cycling history, which has been interpreted in terms of tree-ring-type structures in the solid phases upon partial cycling. We present a combined modeling and experimental study of the electrochemical behavior of LFP-based single cells. Goal of the study is to improve understanding of the elec-trochemical behavior and to develop strategies for imped-ance-based and model-based state-of-charge diagnostics. On the experimental side, in-situ electrochemical charac-terization is performed via steady-state charge/discharge measurements and electrochemical impedance spectros-copy. Ex-situ structural characterization is performed via computer tomography for the macro-structure and scanning electron microscopy for the micro-structure. On the theory side, a detailed kinetic model is used for data interpretation. The 1 D+ 1 D model represents multi-component transport (mass, charge, heat) within a cell repeat <b>unit</b> (anode, <b>separator,</b> cathode) as well as solid-state diffusion within the active materials. All studies are performed on commercial high-power cells (A 123). The combined experimental and simulation results allow a detailed insight into the electrochemical behavior of the cell as a function of operating conditions and state-of-charge. Although the steady-state discharge curves demonstrate the flat discharge characteristics, the im-pedance spectra show a clear variation as function of the state-of-charge. Using a model-based impedance interpretation, strategies for practical SOC diagnostics are being assessed. ...|$|R
