5000|$|The ADR 2130, {{designed}} by Marty Wilcox {{was the first}} portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>unit</b> commercially available in the United States, being released in 1975. This unit weighed about 25 lbs, had 3 linear probes to choose from and used an oscilloscope for a display instead of a TV monitor. ADR was later purchased by ATL which later spun off its portable technology into a company that became Sonosite. ATL was later purchased by Philips while Sonosite came out with its first battery powered portable offering, the Sonosite 180 released in 1999. Previous to this, Ecton produced a low-cost portable cardiac ultrasound system that could be carried by hand in March 1998, called the Sonnet [...] but the test prototypes were never put into full-scale production because of difficulty finding venture capital. Ecton was purchased by Acuson in 1999 and the Sonnet system was released as the Acuson Cypress Cypress portable ultrasound system in 2000. The first battery powered portable was the Organon Teknika MiniVisor produced in 1979, but which saw only limited production. The device was created by {{a team led by}} Klaas Bom of the Erasmus MC and Organon Teknika. The first dual-touch screen portable the Hyperion ultrasound system distributed through Graydon Pierce Imaging is designed specifically for the most hostile and demanding medical environments - Military Medical Applications (MEDCOM), Emergency Medical Services, Trauma Centers and Humanitarian Relief Operations. Recently GE has come out with the VScan and Vscan dual probe, which offer almost a micro-ultrasound. Importantly, its price point is such that they can be issued to individual physicians.|$|E

30|$|Pocket <b>ultrasound</b> <b>units</b> are not {{currently}} approved in Canada or the United States for {{the measurement of}} ONSD in human subjects as the existing units {{do not have the}} required presets to make these measurements safely. For this reason, we elected to perform this initial pilot study utilizing our ONSD model. The recommended settings for ONSD ultrasound in human subjects requires a thermal index (TI) ≤ 1 and mechanical index (MI) ≤ 0.23 [23] which are not achievable with the current Vscan firmware. We, therefore, do not encourage the “off-label” usage of these machines in live human subjects until the appropriate presets are made available.|$|R
30|$|The {{department}} of radiology at Wangchuck National Referral Hospital {{is equipped with}} a CT scanner (Brilliance 16 from Philips Medical), MRI scanner (Signa 1.5  T from General Electric), and a digital radiology unit (IDC DR 1590 CURA) as well as five <b>ultrasound</b> <b>units</b> from different vendors (two Logiq e series GE Medical, one Siemens Acuson X 500, and two Philips Clear Vue 350). All these modalities have the ability to export images digitally in DICOM compliant format. The hospital is also equipped with an internal secured Ethernet local area network available across the hospital as well as a restricted Wi-Fi network. The radiology department benefits from a separate sub-network allowing a better communication bandwidth between different imaging equipment.|$|R

40|$|Because of its availability, {{ultrasound}} {{should be}} the preferred initial modality {{for the evaluation of}} palpable superficial masses. Most <b>ultrasound</b> <b>units</b> are equipped with high frequency probes that allow superficial focalization. The differential diagnosis of soft tissue masses and the sonographic features of some benign and malignant soft tissue lesions are reviewed in this article. After an initial ultrasound evaluation confirming the presence of a tumor, the need for and the role of other imaging modalities can be determined. In selected cases ultrasound may obviate the need for further imaging. MRI and CT should be reserved for cases in which sonography fails to establish a specific diagnosis or to demonstrate the limits of the soft tissue mass.

40|$|Measurement of thyroid {{size and}} volume {{is a useful}} {{clinical}} parameter in both human and veterinary medicine, particularly for diagnosing thyroid diseases and guiding corrective therapy. Procuring a fully-equipped clinical <b>ultrasound</b> <b>unit</b> (FCUS) may be difficult in most veterinary settings. The present study evaluated the inter-equipment variability in dolphin thyroid ultrasound measurements between a portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>unit</b> (PUS) and a FCUS; for both units, repeatability was also assessed. Thyroid ultrasound examinations were performed on 15 apparently healthy bottlenose dolphins with both PUS and FCUS under identical scanning conditions. There was {{a high level of}} agreement between the two ultrasound units in dolphin thyroid measurements (ICC = 0. 859 – 0. 976). A high intra-operator repeatability in thyroid measurements was found (PUS: ICC = 0. 854 – 0. 984, FCUS: ICC = 0. 709 – 0. 954). As a conclusion, no substantial inter-equipment variability was found between PUS and FCUS in dolphin thyroid size measurements under identical scanning conditions, supporting further application of PUS for quantitative analyses of dolphin thyroid gland in both research and clinical practices at aquariu...|$|E
40|$|With {{development}} of portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>units,</b> ultrasonography has grown significantly in {{many aspects of}} equine practice. Ocular ultrasonography is indicated in cases of corneal edema, cataracts, or intraocular hemorrhage, because the normally clear ocular media has become opaque and visualization of the interior structures of the globe is restricted. Technological advancements have introduced various methods of ultrasonography {{to the field of}} ophthalmology. Color Doppler technique is used to visualize blood vessels and their flow characteristics within the eye and orbit. Ocular and orbital ultrasonography is usually easily performed in the standing horse following sedation, an auriculopalpebral nerve block, and the application of topical anesthetic (e. g. proparacaine, tetracaine) to the ocular surface. This chapter presents images of ultrasonographic changes in the abnormal eye. Exophthalmos and trauma are the most common indications for orbital ultrasonography...|$|R

Review of the fetal perineum, including sex determination, is {{considered part of}} the complete obstetric ultrasound 1; however, if no abnormalities are seen but determination is inconclusive, the examination should not be prolonged or repeated solely to determine fetal sex. The Supreme Court of Canada (McInerney v.

30|$|The technique, however, can {{be quite}} challenging.

30|$|The {{advantage}} of our ONSD model is: {{it creates a}} controlled environment where the known disc size was consistent across different measurements and readers. This allows for an isolated comparison of measurement accuracy inherent to each technique and observer. On the surface, comparing the resolution of two <b>ultrasound</b> <b>units</b> to measure a fixed structure {{may seem like a}} simple task. The Vscan linear probe has a frequency range of 8 – 3.4  MHz which is significantly lower than the SonoSite’s 13 – 6  MHz probe. However, one must consider more than just sheer resolution of the <b>unit,</b> as <b>ultrasound</b> imaging is an operator dependent task that involves optic nerve sheath interpretation, caliper measurement, and ease of software and probe usage. Hence, the primary outcome of agreement between the two measurements is not only important, but also the secondary outcomes of inter-rater and within-subject reliability.|$|R
40|$|Most obstetric {{ultrasound}} scanning {{is carried out}} by radiographers, who have professional constraints that forbid them to disclose the result of any investigation to any patient or to hold themselves as professionally qualified to diagnose. A nationwide survey was carried out to explore the paramedical aspects of obstetric ultrasound services and determine how radiographers reconcile their professional constraints with the needs and expectations of patients. It was concluded that over 70 % of obstetric scanning in the United Kingdom is carried out by radiographers who tell patients some results and report both numerical and interpretational data to referring clinicians. This survey suggests that constraints on radiographers who perform obstetric ultrasonography are excessively restrictive and conflict with everyday clinical demands. The medical supervision of some obstetric <b>ultrasound</b> <b>units</b> should be improved, and partners of patients should not be encouraged to expect access to obstetric scans unless radiographers have close medical support...|$|R
