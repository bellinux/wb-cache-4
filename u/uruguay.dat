5|$|As Brazil {{had been}} pacified {{after the end}} of the last {{rebellion}} (the Praieira revolt), Brazil's government turned its attention to the growing tensions with its neighbor to the south, the Argentine Confederation. Paulino Soares, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, decided to forge alliances with <b>Uruguay</b> and Paraguay, nations which also saw a threat in the ambitions of Juan Manuel de Rosas, dictator of the Argentine Confederation. An army commanded by Caxias crossed into <b>Uruguay</b> in September 1851. More than a year had passed since Honório Hermeto returned from Pernambuco, when he was named by Paulino Soares as special minister plenipotentiary in the Plata region. On 12 October 1851, Honório Hermeto and an Uruguayan envoy signed a treaty in Rio de Janeiro setting the international border between Brazil and <b>Uruguay.</b> The agreement required <b>Uruguay</b> to abandon some claims to disputed areas in exchange for Brazilian aid in the war against Argentina.|$|E
5|$|As {{war with}} the British Empire threatened, Brazil had to turn its {{attention}} to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in <b>Uruguay</b> as its political parties turned against each other. The internal conflict led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and looting of their property in <b>Uruguay.</b> Brazil's government decided to intervene, fearful of giving any impression of weakness in the face of conflict with the British. A Brazilian army invaded <b>Uruguay</b> in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War, which ended in February 1865. Meanwhile, the dictator of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López took advantage of the situation to establish his country as a regional power. The Paraguayan army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (the area known after 1977 as the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the Paraguayan War. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory as a prelude to an attack on Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
5|$|Don Juan Manuel de Rosas, the {{dictator}} of Argentina, had assisted the separatist rebels in the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul during the 1830s, {{and continued to}} attempt its annexation. In addition to the threat to Brazil's territorial integrity, Rosas had ambitions to conquer Paraguay, <b>Uruguay</b> and Bolivia. Brazil's Conservative Cabinet decided to form military alliances with the countries threatened by {{the dictator}}. On 4 September 1851, Brazil's army, commanded by Luis Alves de Lima e Silva (then Count of Caxias), crossed the border into <b>Uruguay.</b>|$|E
