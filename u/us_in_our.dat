25|$|Involuntary autobiographical memory (IAM) {{retrieval}} occurs spontaneously as {{the result}} of sensory cues as well as internal cues, such as thought or intention. These cues influence <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> day-to-day lives by constantly and automatically activating unconscious memories through priming. It has been demonstrated in many studies that our specific goals and intentions will most frequently result in the retrieval of related IAM, while the second most frequent IAM retrievals result from physical cues in the surrounding context. Autobiographical memories that are unrelated to any specific cues, whether internal or external, are the least frequent to occur. It has been suggested that in this case, an error in self-regulation of memory has occurred that results in an unrelated autobiographical memory reaching the conscious mind. These findings are consistent with metacognition as the third type of experience is often identified as the most salient one.|$|E

Reagan called Brezhnev [...] "one of the world's most {{important}} figures for nearly two decades" [...] and expressed hopes {{for the improvement of}} Soviet–US relations. Pope John Paul II promised [...] "a particular thought for the memory of the illustrious departed one", while former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said Brezhnev's death would [...] "be painfully felt".

He recorded nine points and three rebounds in a debut loss to the Orlando Magic. He played his first home game in Milwaukee three days later and scored 16 points while grabbing eight boards in a 78–72 win over the Chicago Bulls. The game was also Yi's first game to be televised nationally in China, where it was watched by an estimated 100 million viewers. Yao Ming praised Yi's play in his first few games, saying, [...] "If you compare <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> third NBA games, {{you will see that}} Yi's statistics are far better than mine." ...|$|E

The Pakistani military had pushed the Taliban out of the cities and into the countryside. Yousafzai's family reunited, and on 24 July 2009 they headed home. They made one stop first – to meet with a group of other grassroots activists that had been invited to see United States President Barack Obama's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke. Yousafzai pleaded with Holbrooke to intervene in the situation, saying, [...] "Respected ambassador, if you can help <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> education, so please help us." [...] When her family finally did return home, they found it had not been damaged, and her school had sustained only light damage.|$|E

500|$|Both sides {{used the}} respite {{to prepare for}} the next day. Virginia put her wounded ashore and {{underwent}} temporary repairs. Captain Buchanan was among the wounded, so command on the second day fell to his executive officer, Lieutenant Catesby ap Roger Jones. Jones proved to be no less aggressive than the man he replaced. While Virginia was being prepared for renewal of the battle, and while Congress was still ablaze, Monitor, commanded by Lieutenant John L. Worden, arrived in Hampton Roads. The Union ironclad had been rushed to Hampton Roads in hopes of protecting the Union fleet and preventing Virginia from threatening Union cities. Captain Worden was informed that his primary task was to protect Minnesota, so Monitor took up a position near the grounded Minnesota and waited. [...] "All on board felt we had a friend that would stand by <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> hour of trial," [...] wrote Captain Gershom Jacques Van Brunt, the vessel's commander, in his official report the day after the engagement.|$|E
500|$|A Child of Our Time {{has survived}} periods of indifference, {{particularly}} in America, to be ranked alongside Britten's War Requiem {{as one of}} the most frequently performed large-scale choral works of the post-Second World War period. According to Meirion Bowen, Tippett's long-time companion and a champion of his music, the work's particular quality is its universal message, with which audiences all over the world have identified. In his notes accompanying the performance at the 2010 Grant Park Music Festival in Chicago, Richard E. Rodda summarises the work's continuing appeal: [...] "t deals with issues as timeless as civilization itself—man's inhumanity to man, the place of the individual who confronts ruthless power ... the need for learning the lessons of history and for compassion and understanding and honesty and equality in our dealings with each other, whatever our differences may be. Tippett's Child still speaks profoundly to <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own deeply troubled time".|$|E
500|$|After a hiatus, Partridge {{returned}} in 2010 {{in a series}} of YouTube shorts, Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge, as the host of a digital radio show with co-presenter Sidekick Simon (Tim Key). Coogan co-wrote the shorts with brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who submitted scripts to his company Baby Cow Productions; the Gibbons have co-written every Partridge project since. According to Neil, Coogan [...] "invited <b>us</b> <b>in,</b> <b>our</b> sensibilities chimed, and before we knew it, Mid Morning Matters was up and running. We wrote it as if it was our baby, and though {{there was a sense that}} we were standing on the shoulders of giants, I think we were like two pairs of fresh eyes, and Steve seemed to fall in love with the character all over again." [...] Coogan said they chose the web format because [...] "it was a bit underground, a low-key environment in which to test the character out again. And the response was so good, we realised there was more fuel in the tank." [...] The shorts were later broadcast by Sky Atlantic.|$|E

500|$|Willis {{built up}} his {{reputation}} in the public {{at a time when}} readers were interested in the personal lives of writers. In his writings, he described the [...] "high life" [...] of the [...] "Upper Ten Thousand", a phrase he coined. His travel writings in particular were popular for this reason as Willis was actually living the life he was describing and recommending to readers. Even so, he manufactured a humble and modest persona, questioned his own literary merit, and purposely used titles, such as Pencillings by the Way and Dashes at Life With Free Pencil, which downplayed their own quality. His informally toned editorials, which covered a variety of topics, were also very successful. Using whimsicality and humor, he was purposely informal to allow his personality to show in his writing. He addressed his readers personally, as if having a private conversation with them. As he once wrote: [...] "We would have you... indulge <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> innocent egotism as if it were all whispered in your private ear and over our iced Margaux". When women poets were becoming popular in the 1850s, he emulated their style and focused on sentimental and moral subjects.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{exploration}} of sexuality was particularly well received by reviewers. The New York Times chief critic Jon Pareles described the tracks as [...] "steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals" [...] noting that [...] "every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable, compassionate or pro-feminist". Caitlin White, writing for The 405, characterized Beyoncé as a feminist text. She {{noted that the}} tracks demonstrate Beyoncé's desire to retain complete sexual agency, while also forgoing the expectations of pop songcraft by placing female pleasure at the forefront unquestioningly. Robert Christgau admired the album's [...] "sex sequence" [...] of songs, where for [...] "over seven well-differentiated tracks", Beyoncé [...] "performs the unlikely feat of conveying an open-ended eroticism that varies because [...] knows eroticism does, for each of <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> individual responses {{as well as for}} her". PopMatters' David Amidon similarly praised the album's honest, highly sexual nature, observing it was [...] "her first attempt at bridging an audience, making music that makes the men want to hear {{what she has to say}} and the women feel like they can say it to men as well".|$|E
500|$|Adam LaClave and Paul Meany {{were the}} primary songwriters for Earthsuit. As Christians, the two wrote lyrics that often communicated a Christian message. For example, the song [...] "Said the Sun" [...] is an allegory about God telling Christians to be {{carriers}} of light. [...] "Whitehorse" [...] was written to present {{a different view of}} the return of Jesus, as LaClave stated in an interview, [...] "Most people, when they hear the term [...] "white horse," [...] think of the analogy of Jesus coming back ... wanted to bring a different meaning to it, because ... He comes to rescue <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> everyday life [...]" [...] The men's lyrics also reflect experiences they have had. Meany once had a dream that inspired him to write [...] "Gummy Buffalo"; he found himself in a candy store and squeezed a gummy buffalo whereupon he heard the melody for the song. Christianity Today has proposed the lyrics in [...] "Foreign" [...] may have been inspired by their departure from Sparrow Records. The lyrics read [...] "There's no place in your world for me / I've been from sea to shining sea / And I can't retain your policies, excuse me / If I'm just hanging around, I'm foreign." ...|$|E

Handlen was complimentary towards the installment's [...] "tremendous sense of purpose [...] builds to a fever pitch that makes questions of who exactly wants what largely irrelevant." [...] While he offered a pessimistic opinion in regards to the series' mythology as a whole, Handlen concluded that the eighth season's sense of purpose, as exemplified in [...] "Essence", made the episode successful. George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of Contra Costa Times praised the episode, writing [...] "where have nifty episodes like [...] been the last two years?" [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. Praising the storyline, he noted that [...] "Thanks to 'Essence', I've become a believer again." [...] John Keegan of Critical Myth gave the episode a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote [...] "overall, this was a wonderful episode that served to prepare us for the final installment of the alien mythology (presumably) and managed to keep <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> seats the entire way." [...] Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone was positive toward both [...] "Essence" [...] and [...] "Existence". Wigmore gave the episodes a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote [...] "the reason that this two-parter works is that its plot is simple enough for the audience to still have a handle on". Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a B+.|$|E
500|$|John met {{the rebel}} barons at Runnymede, and on 19June 1215 they renewed their vows of fealty. A peace treaty, which later {{became known as}} Magna Carta, was sealed. Shortly after the treaty the {{agreement}} between John and Langton to appoint a royal constable in charge of Rochester Castle was dissolved, returning control to the archbishop. The peace did not last and the First Barons' War broke out. A group of rebels headed to Rochester to hold the city against John. The events surrounding the rebels' takeover of the castle are unclear, but contemporary chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall recorded that the king demanded Langton hand over the castle to royal control and the archbishop refused. Although Langton held out against the king's demands, the rebels feared he would eventually cave to pressure from the king and seized control of Rochester Castle for themselves. According to Ralph of Coggeshall, this {{was done with the}} consent of the castle's constable, Reginald de Cornhill, who seems to have switched allegiance from the king to the archbishop after John appointed him as royal constable of the castle. Langton left the country that same month, leaving the castle {{in the hands of the}} king's enemies. In a letter that year to justiciar Hubert de Burgh John expressed his anger towards Langton, calling him [...] "a notorious traitor to us, since he did not render our castle of Rochester to <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> so great need." [...] After this point, Rochester Castle was no longer considered to be in the perpetual custody of the archbishops of Canterbury.|$|E
