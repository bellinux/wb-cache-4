40|$|A {{photoluminescence}} {{emission band}} at 830 nm has been detected in single heterojunction quantum well structures (modulation‐doped structures) {{in the range}} of 250 – 400 [*]K. This emission band is observed neither in heterojunction structures without a two‐dimensional electron gas (2 DEG), nor in n+ AlGaAs and GaAs. The intensity of the emission band increases as the mobility of the samples with 2 DEG and shows excitonic behavior in its variation with incident laser excitation intensity. This photoluminescence emission was observed in samples grown by both molecular beam epitaxy and by organometallic vapor phase epitaxy. This effect may be <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> a <b>rough</b> identification of high quality, modulation‐doped heterostructures...|$|R
40|$|Typically, {{evaluations}} of the environmental performance of municipal solid waste (MSW) management systems involve crude measures that are subjective in nature. The most common such measure is the recycling rate – the percentage of MSW that is separated from the waste stream for materials recovery. While <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> a <b>rough</b> estimate {{of the performance of}} cities, materials recycling {{is not the only way}} to conserve resources. Energy recovery – from waste to energy (WTE) power plants or landfill gas to energy systems – also contributes to improved environmental performance. The principal objective of this thesis was to quantify the environmental performance of municipal waste management systems by introducing and utilizing a new metric, the resource conservation efficiency (RCE). RCE measures the lifecycle energy efficiency of materials and its value depends on the recyclability of the material as well as the method cities choose to dispose of non-recyclable materials. To verify the validity of RCE as an environmental metric, a life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) was performed. It was shown that the cumulative energy demand for different materials correlates strongly with EcoIndicator 99 scores, a common LCI...|$|R
40|$|We contend that, with a {{suitably}} broad {{notion of}} rationality and a diverse set of motivations, the game-theoretic tradition is particularly {{well suited for}} generating insights about effects of deliberative institutions and that progress {{in the development of}} deliberative democratic theory hinges on making proper sense of the relationship between game-theoretic and normative theoretic approaches to deliberation. To advance this view, we explore the central methodological issues at the core of that relationship and address the arguments raised against the relevance of game-theoretic work on deliberation. We develop a framework for thinking about the differences in how the normative and the game-theoretic approaches frame and answer questions about deliberation and articulate an approach to a deliberative democratic theory that builds on the strengths of both of these theoretic traditions, properly informed by empirical scholarship. Democracy is minimally defined as a form of governance in which policy decisions are made by a majority vote of the citizens. While <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> a <b>rough</b> way of classifying polities, this definition is, on closer examination, both ambiguous and radically incomplete. The main thrust of the critique of minimal democracy developed in contemporary democratic theor...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the nature of star formation processes in amorphous galaxies, short wavelength International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) spectra of galaxies NGC 1705 and NGC 1800 were obtained. The IUE data for NGC 1705 were of excellent quality while the low signal-to-noise NGC 1800 observation was <b>useful</b> only <b>as</b> a <b>rough</b> guide to the ultraviolet energy distribution. It was found that NGC 1705 contains a normal mix of OB stars, which is consistent with the nearly constant recent star formation rate inferred from new optical data. The NGC 1800 is likely to have similar properties, and blue galaxies with amorphous structures thus do not show evidence for anomalies in stellar mass distributions. The UV spectra of amorphous galaxies {{and a variety of other}} hot extragalactic stellar systems have similar characteristics, which suggests OB stellar populations often are homogeneous in their properties...|$|R
40|$|Potent polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), {{polychlorinated dibenzofurans}} (PCDFs), and dioxinlike polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) {{are among the}} most {{relevant}} toxic emissions from incinerators. Induction of cytochrome P 450 1 A 1 -catalyzed 7 -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity in mammalian cell culture (EROD bioassay) is thought to be a selective and sensitive parameter used for the quantification of dioxinlike compounds. Fly ash extracts from municipal waste incinerators (MWI), a crematorium, wood combustors, and a noble metal recycling facility were analyzed in the EROD bioassay using rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Fractions containing 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted PCDDs/PCDFs, dioxinlike PCBs, and 16 major polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were isolated from the extract and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and by the EROD bioassay. It was found that with MWI samples the bioassay of the extract resulted in a two- to fivefold higher estimate of TCDD equivalents (TEQ) than the chemical analysis of PCDDs/PCDFs and PCBs. However, the outcome of both methods was significantly correlated, making the bioassay <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> a <b>rough</b> estimate for the sum of potent PCDDs/PCDFs and dioxinlike PCBs in extracts from MWI fly ash samples and in a fly ash sample from a crematorium. In noble metal recycling facility and wood combustor samples, higher amounts of PAHs were found, contributing to more pronounced differences between the results of both methods. The remaining unexplained inducing potency in fly ash samples probably results from additional dioxinlike components including certain PAHs not analyzed in this study. The hypothesis that emissions from MWI of hitherto unidentified dioxinlike compounds are higher by orders of magnitude than emissions of potent PCDDs/PCDFs and dioxinlike PCBs could not be confirmed. We found no indication for a marked synergistic interaction of dioxinlike fly ash components in the bioassay...|$|R
