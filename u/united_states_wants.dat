25|$|People's Republic of China, {{though not}} a G7 industralised nations member, is {{expected}} to loom large, with the minister and central bankers to press Beijing to further ease controls of the Renminbi. The agenda of the meeting is about what {{will be seen as}} dangerous imbalances in the global economy. The United States has run up massive accounts and budget deficits, export-led surpluses are developing in Asia. It also marks the debut to the G7 meetings, that is United States Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who was formerly the {{chairman and chief executive officer}} of Goldman Sachs. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> the fight against terrorism and nuclear proliferation to be included on the agenda. The Program of Seminars opens on this day and runs for two days. The G24 ministers meeting will be held at SSICEC as well as the Program of Seminars.|$|E

The last thing the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> to see is a resumption of nuclear testing or the proliferation of nuclear weapons – and it is the last thing Australia wants to see.

In 2004, then opposition leader Don Brash refused to confirm or deny that he told visiting US senators the nuclear ban would be repealed [...] "by lunchtime" [...] if he was elected prime minister. Brash quit politics after losing the 2005 election and [...] "gone by lunchtime" [...] became a political catchphrase in New Zealand.|$|E

White House spokesman Larry Speakes told reporters at the time [...] "The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> to emphasize the fundamental and durable interest that the United States and Egypt share, interests which transcends this difficult incident." [...] Mubarak described what the U.S. had done as a [...] "stab in the back". The Reagan administration sent a diplomatic envoy led by Deputy Secretary of State John C.
