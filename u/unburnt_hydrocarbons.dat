2500|$|The {{trailing}} side of {{the rotary}} engine's combustion chamber develops a squeeze stream which pushes back the flame front. With the conventional one or two-spark-plug system and homogenous mixture, this squeeze stream prevents the flame from propagating to the combustion chamber's trailing side in the mid and high engine speed ranges. Kawasaki dealt with that problem in its US patent , and Toyota obtained a 7% economy improvement by placing a glow-plug in the leading site, and using Reed-Valves in intake ducts.

A side-port exhaust, as is used in the Mazda Renesis, avoids one of the causes of this because the unburned mixture cannot escape. The Mazda 26B avoided this problem through the use of a three spark-plug ignition system.

The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the environmental aspects of pongamia bio-fuel in a single cylinder diesel engine with the influence of fuel injection pressure. Approach: Bio-fuel was prepared from non-edible Pongamia pinnata oil by transesterification and used as a fuel in C. I engine. The effect of fuel injection pressure on the engine emission characteristics of a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine has been experimentally investigated using pongamia pinnata methyl ester and its blends with diesel fuel from 0 - 30 % with an increment of 5 % at full load. The tests were conducted at five different injection pressures (190, 200, 210, 220 and 230 KN m - 2) by means of adjusting injector spring tension. Results: Compared to diesel, blend B 5 exhibits lower engine emissions of <b>unburnt</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon di oxide at full load. The High injection pressure of 220 KN m - 2 shows lesser emissions of <b>unburnt</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> and carbon monoxide while oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide are found to be slightly higher than diesel and blends at full load. Conclusion: From the test results, it was found that a high injection pressure of 220 KN m - 2 causes better atomization with improved engine emission characteristics for diesel and blends at full load.

50|$|As {{combustion}} temperature tends to increase with leaner fuel air mixtures, <b>unburnt</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> pollutants must be balanced against {{higher levels of}} pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are created at higher {{combustion temperature}}s.

With direct injection this effect is not as dramatic but it can cool down the combustion chamber enough to reduce certain pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), while raising others such as partially decomposed hydrocarbons.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper reviews {{progress}} {{in the development of}} methods for calculating the properties of gas turbine combustion chambers, with particular attention being devoted to combustion and turbulence–combustion interactions. For conventional combustion chambers with non-premixed combustion it is argued that a conserved scalar approach, where burning is presumed to be ‘fast’, is capable of providing an accurate representation of heat-releasing processes. The approach can also be extended to include NO 2 formation, at least under conditions where it is formed under high-temperature conditions. However, if carbon monoxide and <b>unburnt</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions or partially premixed combustion is to be considered, then a more complete description of combustion is needed and the probability density function (PDF) transport equation method here represents a promising approach.

The average temperature of a piston crown in a gasoline engine during normal operation is typically about , and the coolant {{that runs through}} the engine block is usually regulated at approximately [...] Aluminum expands more than iron at this temperature range, so for the piston to fit the cylinder properly when at a normal operating temperature, the piston must have a loose fit when cold. In the 1970s, increasing concern over exhaust pollution caused the U.S. government to form the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which began writing and enforcing rules that required automobile manufacturers to introduce changes that made their engines run cleaner. By the late 1980s, automobile exhaust pollution had been noticeably improved, but more stringent regulations forced car manufacturers to adopt the use of electronically controlled fuel injection and hypereutectic pistons.

5000|$|An {{increase}} in the number of aircraft also means greater carbon emissions. Environmental scientists have voiced concern over the main kinds of pollution associated with aircraft, mainly noise and emissions. Aircraft engines have been historically notorious for creating noise pollution and the expansion of airways over already congested and polluted cities have drawn heavy criticism, making it necessary to have environmental policies for aircraft noise. Noise also arises from the airframe, where the airflow directions are changed. Improved noise regulations have forced designers to create quieter engines and airframes. Emissions from aircraft include particulates, carbon dioxide (CO2), Sulfur dioxide(SO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), various oxides of nitrates and <b>unburnt</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> [...] To combat the pollution, ICAO set recommendations in 1981 to control aircraft emissions. Newer, environmentally friendly fuels have been developed and the use of recyclable materials in manufacturing have helped reduce the ecological impact due to aircraft.

Space limitations, pavement design, runway end safety areas and the unique location of airport are some of the airport factors that influence aircraft design. However changes in aircraft design also influence airfield design as well, for instance, the recent introduction of new large aircraft (NLAs) such as the superjumbo Airbus A380, have led to airports worldwide redesigning their facilities to accommodate its large size and service requirements.|$|E
