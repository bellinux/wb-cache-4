5|$|For {{the first}} 10,000 years, the EPA would retain the 2001 final rule’s dose limit of 15millirem per year. This is {{protection}} {{at the level}} of the most stringent radiation regulations in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>today.</b> From 10,000 to one million years, EPA established a dose limit of 100millirem per year. EPA's rule requires the Department of Energy to show that Yucca Mountain can safely contain wastes, considering the effects of earthquakes, volcanic activity, climate change, and container corrosion, over one million years. The current analysis indicates that the repository will cause less than 1mrem/year public dose through 1,000,000 years.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{have been}} present in the American West since the 1500s, when they arrived with Spanish explorers. Many escaped, were {{released}} by the Spanish or stolen by Native Americans. Their descendents crossed with horses who escaped from or were released by other European settlers, including draft breeds brought by farmers and wagoneers and lighter riding horses brought by the United States Cavalry. Horses of French descent also moved {{across the border from}} Canada to contribute to the herds. The mixture of these breeds created the Mustang present in the western portion of the <b>US</b> <b>today.</b> By the early 1970s, it was assumed that due to crossbreeding, the original Spanish stock had been eliminated from feral herds. In 1971, the Wild and Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act was passed, giving the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) the authority to manage the feral horse populations in the American West.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Ruby {{founded the}} Colorado Ranger Horse Association (CRHA), and {{was granted a}} {{corporate}} charter for the association in 1938. Ruby remained president of the organization from 1935 {{until his death in}} 1942. The registry initially imposed a 50-member limit, and many Ranger horses, whose breeders were not allowed to become members, were instead registered with the Appaloosa Horse Club. The member limit was lifted in 1964, and since then pedigree research has continued to find and register horses with Ranger breeding that are un-registered or registered as Appaloosas. During the 1980s, some Lusitano blood was allowed into the breed, but this practice has been discontinued. The CRHA states that up to 1 in 8 registered Appaloosas may have Colorado Ranger blood, and as such be eligible for registry with the CRHA. As of 2005, there were more than 6,000 horses registered with the CRHA, with between 100 and 125 new horses registered annually. While originally bred in the western <b>US,</b> <b>today</b> many Colorado Rangers are found in the midwest and eastern parts of the country, including the states of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. They are also found in Canada, where {{there is at least one}} large breeding farm.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the book's basic {{accuracy}} countered on {{the points}} raised by skeptics such as footbinding and the Great Wall of China. Historian Stephen G. Haw {{argued that the}} Great Walls were built to keep out northern invaders, whereas the ruling dynasty during Marco Polo's visit were those very northern invaders. They note that the Great Wall familiar to <b>us</b> <b>today</b> is a Ming structure built some two centuries after Marco Polo's travels; and that the Mongol rulers whom Polo served controlled territories both {{north and south of}} today's wall, and would have no reasons to maintain any fortifications that may have remained there from the earlier dynasties. Other Europeans who travelled to Khanbaliq during the Yuan Dynasty, such as Giovanni de' Marignolli and Odoric of Pordenone, said nothing about the wall either. The Muslim traveler Ibn Batutta, who asked about the wall when he visited China during the Yuan Dynasty, could find no one who had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it, suggesting that while ruins of the wall constructed in the earlier periods might have existed, they were not significant or noteworthy at that time.|$|E

25|$|Blast mining or {{conventional}} mining, is {{an older}} practice that uses explosives such as dynamite {{to break up}} the coal seam, after which the coal is gathered and loaded onto shuttle cars or conveyors for removal to a central loading area.

25|$|Defeat meant {{acceptance}} of Union {{and the search}} for an identity that was Unionist but also uniquely Scottish. One aspect was converting Highlanders from half-naked savages into a noble warrior race. For decades before 1745, rural poverty drove many to enlist in European armies but while military experience was common, the military aspects of clanship itself had been in decline for many years. Foreign service was banned after 1745 and recruitment into the British Army accelerated as deliberate policy. Britain was at war for 43 of the years between 1756 and 1815 with Scotland providing disproportionate numbers of recruits. During Empire, British policy makers focused recruiting on a small number of so-called 'martial races,' a category including Highlanders, Sikhs, Dogras and Gurkhas. In many ways, this view remains with <b>us</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

All across the US the seats of regional government were normally built in the grand traditions of Rome, with vast flights of stone steps sweeping up to towering pillared porticoes, with huge domes gilded or decorated inside with the same or similar themes that were popular in Rome.|$|E
