5000|$|The 2001 UK Census {{classified}} ethnicity {{into several}} groups: White, Black, Asian, Mixed, Chinese and Other. These categories {{formed the basis}} for all National Statistics ethnicity statistics until the 2011 Census results were issued. The 1991 UK census was the first to include a question on ethnicity. A number of academics have pointed out that the ethnicity classification employed in the census and other official statistics in the UK since 1991 involve confusion between the concepts of ethnicity and race. David I.

The paper is based on empirical data from an exploratory eye-tracking study of the <b>user</b> <b>consultation</b> behaviour of six participants and on interview data from a follow-up post-study interview of the participants. The paper elucidates and discusses the consultation behaviour in Internet lexicography and shows not only at what the participants looked, but also how they accessed lexicographic data. The paper presents a suitable method for using eye-tracking studies in Internet lexicography and advocates an increased use of this method to produce empirical data upon which additional theoretical considerations on the information and data access process can be developed.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{elucidate}} how occupants perceive their lit environments in a university setting and how they interact with lighting controls using qualitative methods. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with academic teaching and research staff. Thematic analysis identified four main themes: control and choice, connection with the outdoors, concentration, and comfort. Participants were largely able to control and adapt their lighting using small power lighting in office spaces and they perceived this as beneficial to comfort and concentration. Participants expressed frustration with the light switches in classrooms, a lack of consistency in lighting controls across the university buildings was particularly notable. Installers should consider how piecemeal upgrades on large estates affect the perception of buildings where occupiers face multiple control systems. The management of the lighting in classroom spaces including the type and location of blinds, lack of regular window cleaning in some buildings and difficulty in minimising light on projection screens in upgraded classrooms were cited as areas for improvement. Wider implications for lighting control and management highlighted by this study include most notably that a lack of end <b>users</b> <b>consultation</b> has serious consequences on their perception of lighting upgrades and their willingness to employ “workarounds”...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{number of}} {{resources}} or items that users can now access when navigating on the Web or using e-services, is so huge that these might feel lost {{due to the}} presence of too much information. Recommender systems are a way to cope with this profusion of data by suggesting items that fit the users' needs. One of the most popular techniques for recommender systems is the collaborative filtering approach that does not use any a priori information about the users, nor any data about the content of the items. Collaborative filtering relies on the preferences of items expressed by users. These are usually recorded under the form of ratings and the recommendation technique exploits these ratings. However, in many e-services, it is inappropriate to ask to rate items; it may indeed interrupt users' activity. In the absence of ratings, classical collaborative filtering techniques cannot be applied; especially the selection of like-minded users for a given user, also called his mentor users, cannot be performed. Fortunately, the behavior of users, such as their consultations, can be collected; this collection is transparent for users. In this paper, we focus on rating-free collaborative filtering: we present a new approach to perform collaborative filtering when no rating is available but when <b>user</b> <b>consultations</b> are known. We propose to take inspiration from local community detection algorithms to form communities of users and deduce the set of mentor users of a given user. These algorithms have the advantage of not only being less complex than community detection algorithms, but also of discovering overlapping communities.

Experiments conducted on the two datasets show that the precision achieved by this community detection algorithm is higher then the baseline that does not perform any mentor selection. In addition, our model almost offsets the absence of ratings by exploiting a set of mentors reduced by 71 % and 99 % compared to the baseline...|$|R
40|$|Background: Research {{registers}} {{of potential}} participants linked to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) {{provide a basis}} for screening and identifying people suitable for studies. Such a system relies upon people joining the register and giving permission for their record to be used in this way. This study describes the process of training clinicians to explain EHR-linked research registers to service users, and to recruit them onto the register. Method: Training materials were developed for clinicians to help them describe the register to service users. These materials were based upon findings from focus groups reported elsewhere, they were then tested with 31 clinicians in early intervention psychosis services and each clinician discussed the register with service users on their caseload (n = 100 service <b>users).</b> <b>Consultations</b> were recorded and analysed in relation to their coverage of the training criteria. Service users also provided data on the acceptability of the process from their perspective. The content of clinicians’ explanations to service users was described, and then compared against the likelihood of service users joining the register. Interpretive statistics (t-test and Chi-Squared) were used to explore differences between consultations in which service users agreed to join the register, and consultations where they did not agree to join. Results: Service users appeared more likely to join the register if they felt control over what they signed up to, this necessitated understanding that they could decide when, how often, and by whom they were contacted, that joining the register did not automatically enlist them to future studies, and that they could change their mind in future. Clinicians’ explanations did not always include that researchers would {{be able to see the}} service users’ EHR. Service users often confused the idea of signing up to the register and signing up to studies themselves. Confidentiality was not well explained, but service users were not always concerned by confidentiality. Conclusion: EHR-linked research registers provide recruitment opportunities, and help service users to find out about research. Implementing these registers within mental health settings requires a trained clinical workforce and an informed service user population...|$|R
