5|$|A bitter union strike {{began in}} May 1941, which was {{resolved}} without the angered Walt Disney's involvement in July and August of that year. As Walt Disney Productions was {{being set up}} as a <b>union</b> <b>shop,</b> Walt Disney and several studio employees were sent by the US government on a Good Neighbor policy trip to Central and South America. The Disney strike and its aftermath led to an exodus of several animation professionals from the studio, from top-level animators such as Art Babbitt and Bill Tytla to artists better known for their work outside the Disney studio such as Frank Tashlin, Maurice Noble, Walt Kelly, Bill Meléndez, and John Hubley. Hubley, with several other Disney strikers, went on to found the United Productions of America studio, Disney's key animation rival in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The Taft-Haftley Act did not, however, outlaw the <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> or {{agency shop}} (although it did place some {{procedural}} restrictions on their establishment and use).|$|E
25|$|The <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> issue came to {{increasingly}} {{dominate the}} WSB's deliberations. Initially, Feinsinger refused to consider any issue other than wage increases. Feinsinger even {{refused to discuss}} the issue with his superior, Putnam. Feinsinger was under pressure to win support for a recommendation by a majority of the Board and issue a report before the union lost patience and struck. CIO and Steelworkers' counsel Arthur Goldberg persuaded the WSB's labor representatives to withhold their support for a recommendation until Feinsinger not only agreed to consider the <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> but recommend it to the president.|$|E

25|$|The steel {{industry}} completed making its case on February 14. Final arguments were made against the <b>union</b> <b>shop.</b> The issue {{had taken on}} increasing importance to the steel manufacturers over the previous three months. Many of the chief executives of the larger steel companies came {{to see themselves as}} the last bulwark against wholesale unionism. Fairless, in particular, felt that if the WSB included a <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> proposal in its recommendations, the ruling would put the government's imprimatur on unionization. The {{steel industry}}, it was felt, was the last defender of capitalism and the free market.|$|E

25|$|Murray and {{the leaders}} of the union {{considered}} the strike a significant win. The union had avoided the imposition of a Taft-Hartley injunction, Truman had gone to significant lengths to protect the union, and the <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> was won {{for the first time in}} the steel industry.|$|E
25|$|Constantine Court was {{the only}} en suite university-owned accommodation, which {{consisted}} of 80 rooms in seven houses.

Adjacent Horlock Court comprised 168 rooms in 14 houses.|$|E
25|$|In July 1948, {{a strike}} was averted {{at the last}} minute as the SAG and major {{producers}} agreed upon a new collective bargaining contract. The major points agreed upon included: full <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> for actors to continue, negotiations for films sent direct to TV, producers could not sue an actor for breach of contract if they strike (but the guild could only strike when the contract expires).|$|E

5000|$|One of {{his first}} acts as {{minority}} leader was to lead a 34-day walkout of 40 Democratic representatives over a right-to-work bill. The bill (House Bill 1468 [...] ) would have prevented union dues from being taken from non-union workers in <b>union</b> <b>shops.</b>|$|R

25|$|Negotiations resumed in Pittsburgh the {{day after}} the {{newspaper}} report. The talks broke down a day later. Sensing weakness on the management side, the union's executive board voted to reject all previously agreed-to tentative contract terms. Desperate employers made a dramatic personal appearance before the Steelworkers' executive board and asked the union to drop its demand for the <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> and sign off on the tentative contract terms. The union refused.|$|E
25|$|Other groups, {{like the}} National Right to Work Committee, has lobbied for laws prohibiting the <b>union</b> <b>shop.</b> Similarly, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's core {{purpose is to}} fight for free {{enterprise}} before Congress, the White House, regulatory agencies, the courts, {{the court of public}} opinion, and governments around the world and has actively lobbied against the Employee Free Choice Act. The NLPC makes a case {{for the end of the}} use of union dues for political purposes. The Center for Union Facts maintains an anti-union website that provides financial and other records about unions.|$|E
25|$|The {{amendments}} also authorized {{individual states}} to outlaw union security clauses (such as the <b>union</b> <b>shop)</b> entirely in their jurisdictions by passing right-to-work laws. A right-to-work law, under Section 14B of Taft–Hartley, prevents unions from negotiating contracts or legally binding documents requiring companies to fire workers {{who refuse to}} join the union. Currently all of {{the states in the}} Deep South and a number of states in the Midwest, Great Plains, and Rocky Mountains regions have right-to-work laws (with six states—Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, and Oklahoma—going one step further and enshrining right-to-work laws in their states' constitutions).|$|E

A number of outlets are housed around the parade, including restaurants, bars and fast-food cafés, plus two banks, a <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> and two small supermarkets, as well as academic blocks.

25|$|Seeking {{experiences}} to write about, Alvin and Heidi Toffler {{spent the next}} five years as blue collar workers on assembly lines while studying industrial mass production in their daily work. He compared his own desire for experience to other writers, such as Jack London, who in his quest for subjects to write about sailed the seas, and John Steinbeck, who went to pick grapes with migrant workers. In their first factory jobs, Heidi became a <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> steward in the aluminum foundry where she worked. Alvin became a millwright and welder. In the evenings Alvin would write poetry and fiction, but discovered he was proficient at neither.|$|E
25|$|The outlawed closed shops were {{contractual}} {{agreements that}} required an employer to hire only labor union members. Union shops, still permitted, require new recruits {{to join the}} union within {{a certain amount of}} time. The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have added other restrictions on the power of unions to enforce union security clauses and have required them to make extensive financial disclosures to all members as part of their duty of fair representation. On the other hand, Congress repealed the provisions requiring a vote by workers to authorize a <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> a few years after the passage of the Act when it became apparent that workers were approving them in virtually every case.|$|E
50|$|Workers {{have the}} right to form and join unions without prior authorization, and {{approximately}} 10% of the total work force (estimated at 5.9 million) was unionized in more than 16,000 unions. Police and military personnel may not organize collectively. Members of unions were free to withdraw from union membership. The law prohibits closed <b>union</b> <b>shops.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Iron Workers Union {{was formed}} in 1896. As the work was {{seasonal}} and most iron workers were unskilled, the union remained weak, {{and much of the}} industry remained unorganized until 1902. That year, the union won a strike against the American Bridge Company, a subsidiary of the newly formed U.S. Steel corporation. American Bridge was the dominant company in the iron industry, and within a year the Iron Workers Union had not only organized almost every United States iron manufacturer, but had also won signed contracts including <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> clauses. The McNamara brothers were Irish American trade unionists. John (known as J.J.) and his younger brother James (known as J.B.) were both active in the International Association of Bridge and Structural Iron Workers (the Iron Workers).|$|E
25|$|Goodwin {{moved the}} company out of Fort Worth, and a <b>union</b> <b>shop,</b> to Virginia {{so it would}} be close to his home of {{operations}} for other AMF brands and, incidentally, a non-union shop in an effort to return the company to profitability. Goodwin sold to Spalding in 1997, closing the sale in January 1998. Spalding returned manufacturing to Hogan's Fort Worth, Texas roots before eventually including the company's assets in a bankruptcy sale of Spalding's Topflite division to Callaway in 2004. Callaway now owns the rights to the Ben Hogan brand. After over a half century and numerous ownership changes, the Ben Hogan line was discontinued by Callaway in 2008. In May 2014, Terry Koehler of Eldolon Brands approached Perry Ellis International and got the rights to use Ben Hogan's name for a line of golf clubs.|$|E
25|$|The Act outlawed closed shops, {{which were}} {{contractual}} agreements that required an employer to hire only union members. Union shops, in which new recruits must join the union {{within a certain}} amount of time, are permitted, but only as part of a collective bargaining agreement and only if the contract allows the worker at least thirty days after the date of hire or the effective date of the contract to join the union. The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have added other restrictions on the power of unions to enforce union security clauses and have required them to make extensive financial disclosures to all members as part of their duty of fair representation.
