40|$|The Aircraft Vortex Spacing System (AVOSS), {{a set of}} {{algorithms}} {{to determine}} aircraft spacing according to wake vortex behavior prediction, requires turbulence profiles to appropriately determine arrival and departure aircraft spacing. The ambient atmospheric turbulence profile must always be produced, even if {{the result is an}} arbitrary (canned) profile. The original turbulence profile code was generated By North Carolina State University and used in a non-real-time environment in the past. All the input parameters could be carefully selected and screened prior to input. Since this code must run in real-time using actual measurements in the field as input, it became imperative to begin a data checking and screening process as part of the real-time implementation. The process described herein is a step towards ensuring that the best possible turbulence profile is always provided to AVOSS. Data fill-ins, constant profiles and arbitrary profiles are used only as a last resort, but are essential to ensure <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>application</b> of AVOSS...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{transactional}} response-time sensitive applications {{have run}} into practical limits {{on the size of}} garbage collected heaps. The heap can only grow until GC pauses exceed the responsetime limits. Sustainable, scalable concurrent collection has become a feature worth paying for. Azul Systems has built a custom system (CPU, chip, board, and OS) specifically to run garbage collected virtual machines. The custom CPU includes a read barrier instruction. The read barrier enables a highly concurrent (no stop-the-world phases), parallel and compacting GC algorithm. The Pauseless algorithm is designed for <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>application</b> execution and consistent mutator throughput in every GC phase. Beyond the basic requirement of collecting faster than the allocation rate, the Pauseless collector is never in a “rush ” to complete any GC phase. No phase places an undue burden on the mutators nor do phases race to complete before the mutators produce more work. Portions of the Pauseless algorithm also feature a “self-healing ” behavior which limits mutator overhead and reduces mutator sensitivity to the current GC state. We present the Pauseless GC algorithm, the supporting hardware features that enable it, and data on the overhead, efficiency, and pause times when running a sustained workload...|$|E

40|$|Abstact: To provide {{uninterrupted}} {{service to}} every subscribe in a wireless network, {{there is a}} need to incorporate a low cost, flexible heterogeneous network which can able to couple any kind of network for efficient spectrum utilization, hence improve system capacity. For data communication Wi-Fi / Wi-MAX integrated network seems to be an ideal solution as it is able to provide easy deployment, high speed data rate and wide range coverage with high throughput, low end to end delay, flat and low jitter. As Wi-Fi (IEEE 802. 11 n) & WiMAX (IEEE 802. 16 m) network support mobility so from real time service providing to surveillance activities for mobile users can be supported by this integrated network. The selection of appropriate routing protocol for high speed <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>applications</b> is an important parameter while designing of scalable, flexible and efficient integrated network. The routing protocol should take into account the mobility factor in the network and the topology being used. So, in this paper we have first designed an integrated Wi-Fi/WiMAX network and then statistically analyze the performance of the network for various routing algorithms. This analysis will help to forecast the best suitable algorithm...|$|R

However, many interactive real-time applications also require this bandwidth in an uninterrupted fashion. The paper describes how multipath routing and local failure reaction {{can be employed}} to provide <b>uninterrupted</b> QoS to <b>applications.</b> We show how multipath route sets {{can be found in}} reasonably meshed networks and how multipath routing can be used to save on the spare capacity required in case of link failures...|$|R

30|$|To support Internet {{connectivity}} in vehicular environments, both {{academics and}} standard organizations {{have made their}} efforts on the state-of-the-art network mobility (NEMO) architecture [9 – 11]. The NEMO Basic Support (NEMO-BS) [10] and later proposed improved solutions [12, 22] provided possibility of seamless communications in vehicular environments. The Mobile IP (MIP)-based solutions and their extensions are usually preferred in NEMO due to their scalability and wide adoption [11, 23, 24]. For instance, the Proxy Mobile IPv 6 (PMIPv 6)-based NEMO (P-NEMO) and fast P-NEMO can achieve low traffic cost and handover latency for vehicular networks [24, 25]. To provide <b>uninterrupted</b> Internet connection, <b>application</b> of a multi-homing technique in NEMO is studied in [14, 26].|$|R
40|$|Distributed, {{event based}} {{applications}} executing on publishsubscribe middleware (aka Event Based Middleware or EBM) {{are subject to}} many disruptive changes at runtime. These changes can be caused either by a change in environmental conditions such as the failure of an event broker node or {{can be caused by}} dynamically evolving application needs such as the sudden need to route events securely from a specific publisher to a set of subscribers. Ideally, the middleware should facilitate <b>uninterrupted</b> execution of <b>applications</b> without costly redeployment {{in the face of these}} changes. We formally study the requirements of such an “adaptive” middleware infrastructure and analyze adaptation in existing efforts. An adaptive overlay for a core level adaptive middleware with a chordal reliability ring is proposed on the basis of the study. We illustrate and prove that two of the adaptation triggers- node and link failures can be handled by the middleware in O (log n) time with the help of the chordal reliability ring...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{multi-level}} inverters is increasing progressively in motor control applications. Many {{pulse width modulation}} (PWM) techniques are proposed in the literature {{and one of the}} popular modulation methods is unipolar phase shifted carrier (UPSC) PWM. This PWM technique is commonly used in <b>uninterrupted</b> power supply <b>applications</b> where transformer multiple primary windings are connected to two-level inverters. However, this modulation technique is not popularly used in drives applications because a conventional induction motor consists of only two terminals per phase. In this study, a multi-level inverter configuration for four pole induction motor drive is presented, where it is compatible to use the above mentioned PWM technique. By using this multi-level inverter configuration and UPSC PWM technique, all lower order harmonics are shifted to four times the switching frequency, which in turn reduces the torque ripple considerably. The proposed concept is tested on 5 hp four-pole induction motor in MATLAB/Simulink and finite element analysis and is also experimentally verified with a laboratory prototype. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed topology and demonstrate the improvement in harmonic profile and torque ripple...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency (RF) {{catheter}} ablation {{guided by}} electroanatomic mapping systems {{is an effective}} therapy for atrial fibrillation. However, it may be affected by respiration movements. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the impact of respiratory gating on procedural parameters in patients undergoing catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS: One-hundred forty consecutive patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation were admitted to study. Respiratory gating module (AccuResp algorithm, Carto 3, Biosense Webster) was enabled in 70 patients and disabled in 70 patients during procedures. Successful pulmonary vein isolation and sinus rhythm were obtained in all patients. A significant reduction in total procedure times [median 77, interquartile range (IQR 66 - 95) min vs median 82 (IQR 72 - 104) min, p < 0. 05] and fluoroscopy times [median 14 (IQR 9 - 17) min vs median 16 (IQR 12 - 22) min, p < 0. 05] were observed in the respiratory gated group. Although ablation times (duration between the first and last ablation) were significantly shorter in respiratory gated group [median 37 (IQR 32 - 53) min vs median 48 (IQR 39 - 65) min, p < 0. 05], total RF application durations were not different between two groups [median 1, 554 (IQR 1, 213 - 2, 196) s vs median 1, 802 (IQR 1, 344 - 2, 448) s, p = 0. 11]. Difference in electroanatomical map reconstruction times was not significant [median 14 (IQR 12 - 16) min in gated group vs median 13 (IQR 10 - 18) min in nongated group, p = 0. 19]. CONCLUSION: Respiratory gating significantly improves fluoroscopy and ablation times during electroanatomic mapping guided AF ablation. Respiratory gated maps may provide <b>uninterrupted</b> continuous ablation <b>applications.</b> Furthermore, using automatic respiratory gating module does not prolong mapping times...|$|R
40|$|The {{phase-out}} of CFCs has shed a {{new light}} over natural refrigerants, which have null global warming potentials. Air would be a natural choice, and although the Brayton cycle usually exhibits a lower coefficient of performance when compared to vapor-compression systems of same capacity, it has been considered in applications other than aircraft cooling. These include gas separation, food processing and preservation, refrigerated containers and train air-conditioning. Price perspectives in the oil market also make the Brayton cycle an alternative to be considered as an option for automotive air conditioning. Even though the Brayton cycle is often employed in low temperature applications, the ambient humidity level {{is essential for the}} <b>uninterrupted</b> operation. For <b>applications</b> far below the ambient air dew point, the condensate is likely to cause icing at the turbine outlet, causing duct obstruction and system failure. The use of a solid desiccant would provide a thorough humidity control, allowing for increased pressure ratios (and thus lower expansion temperatures) even for significant ambient humidity levels. In the standard Brayton refrigeration cycle, the air is collected by the compressor at ambient conditions, and compressed through a specified compression ratio. The air is then cooled back to the ambient temperature at a regenerator, and sub-sequentially expanded through a turbine to the ambient pressure, at a low temperature. At the proposed cycle, the air is collected by a desiccant wheel and dehumidified, before it is admitted to the compressor. Accordingly, it can be compressed under a significant pressure ratio, without incurring in ice formation when later expanded. The desiccant wheel is dried using the hot air at the compressor outlet, by a heat exchanger which collects the heat that would be otherwise dumped by the regenerator. A mathematical model for the proposed cycle is developed, consisting of a system of non-linear equations which stems from mass and energy balances applied to each individual cycle component. The results show that the desiccant assisted cycle allows for frost-free operation even for temperatures below - 60 °C, which is required for fish preservation warehouses...|$|R
