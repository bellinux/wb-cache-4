40|$|Introduction. Civil {{litigation}} {{serves a}} multitude of goals, {{many of which were}} explicitly touched upon in the previous chapters. Civil litigation in the fi rst instance is a way of resolving confl icts. Depending on <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> confl ict at hand, the plaintiff for example may want the court to issue a declaration regarding <b>the</b> <b>unlawfulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defendant’s behaviour, or he may want the defendant to restore the status quo ante, to refrain from further infringements, to perform his contractual duties, to compensate his losses, or to restitute illegitimate benefi ts. In essence, civil litigation is a way to realise rights and entitlements, without having to resort to vigilantism. In addition, civil litigation is a driving force behind legal development. The continuous fl ow of cases forces (or maybe better: enables) courts to fi nd new solutions for existing problems. An ever- changing society is confronted with confl icts which legislators cannot all foresee ex ante. However, the ex post character of civil litigation enables courts to seek solutions to the arisen issues...|$|R

40|$|Section 14 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution {{provides}} {{for the right to}} privacy, which includes the right not to have <b>the</b> privacy <b>of</b> communications infringed. <b>The</b> right is also protected at common law- a breach of a person's privacy constitutes an iniura. E-mail communications are therefore protected by both, the common law and the Constitution. The question that this work seeks to answer is, whether the Government has the right to intercept and/or monitor private e-mail communications.

40|$|In legal writing various views {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{with respect to}} <b>the</b> consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entitled person. According to the prevailing view, it is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conditions eliminating <b>the</b> <b>unlawfulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infringement <b>of</b> personal interests. However, <b>the</b> proponents <b>of</b> this view admit that consent fulfills many functions. It may eliminate <b>the</b> very infringement <b>of</b> some personal interests (image, secrecy <b>of</b> mail). <b>The</b> most important function of consent consists in its capacity to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>unlawfulness</b> <b>of</b> behaviour. <b>The</b> article contains <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above problems on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> Polish civil law. It does not consider penal law issues. <b>The</b> author is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opinion that providing for <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> validity <b>of</b> consent in <b>the</b> amended Civil Code is not necessary. According to a rather generally accepted view, <b>the</b> consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entitled person is a unilateral revokable legal action Legal consequences occur here irrespective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acting behavior. The borderline between <b>the</b> consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entitled person and the activity undertaken at one's own risk is blurred. The article contains a detailed analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> consent. <b>The</b> consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entitled person {{is very important in}} medical treatment. In principle, any treatment, especially surgery, requires <b>the</b> consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient. Similar situation takes place in matters of special interest today (e. g. <b>the</b> admissibility <b>of</b> ex vivo transplants). Here, very strict criteria of consent should be applied. Next, the author discusses <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> consent in sport. The participation in brutal or dangerous sport competitions (especially in boxing) is tantamount to the consent to slight bodily injury and infringement <b>of</b> personal inviolability. <b>The</b> article contains also <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> consent in <b>the</b> sphere <b>of</b> protection of other personal interests (especially privacy). In <b>the</b> sphere <b>of</b> personal interest protection the Roman Law adage volenti non jit iniuria is <b>of</b> limited significance. <b>The</b> intencity <b>of</b> personal interests protection would be weakened if too wide application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> consent were adopted.

40|$|Use of inter-loop aiding for {{improving}} tracking performance {{has been widely}} researched in recent years. However, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previously proposed <b>aiding</b> schemes rely {{on the assumption that}} <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop remains unaffected by received interference. This paper argues that this may not always be the case. It is likely that <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop may also degrade in the case where interference is received at <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> carrier’s frequency resulting in performance degradation of both aiding and aided loops. This paper proposes an aiding scheme that offers performance improvements in case interference corrupts both frequencies.

A relationship between <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> signal and its effects on <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop is analysed.

It is argued that aid practice was strongly influenced by factors which are external to deliberate aid policy making. Crisis in the countries in Central Africa, which were traditionally major beneficiaries of Belgian aid, for instance, did heavily impinge upon the structure and main components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> programme, <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> volume and <b>the</b> geographic concentration <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> whereas internal political discussions in Belgium, in particular linguistic tensions, largely dominated the various institutional reforms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> department. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{three main}} goals of tort law that are {{distinguished}} in contemporary Dutch legal literature (compensation, prevention and loss spreading) all recur in the Law and Economics goal (minimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total costs <b>of</b> damaging events), although compensation {{is regarded as}} the means with which to strive for prevention and loss spreading. In this study, among other things it is analyzed whether <b>the</b> three forms <b>of</b> <b>unlawfulness</b> from art. 6 : 162 Civil Code from a Law and Economics perspective all have an independent rationale, or that the negligence rule in the end is always determinative. Furthermore, it is argued that the Law and Economics approach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negligence rule weighing <b>the</b> costs <b>of</b> care against <b>the</b> losses that can be prevented with it fits well in Dutch law. Subsequently, the mutual relationship between unlawfulness and accountability and between fault liability and strict liability is analyzed. Different situations of strict liability in Dutch law are evaluated from a Law and Economics point of view, and many of them prove to fit well in the Law and Economics framework. In <b>the</b> legal duty <b>of</b> compensation, it turns out, among other things, that the damages for fatal accidents are much too low from a Law and Economics viewpoint, that <b>the</b> doctrine <b>of</b> Demogue-Besier, that requires a causal relati! onship between <b>the</b> <b>unlawfulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> act and the losses, should be restored, and that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elements <b>of</b> imputation according to reasonableness do not belong in the causation phase or are even totally irrelevant.
