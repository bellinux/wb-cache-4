25|$|Muslims {{believe that}} Islam is the {{complete}} and <b>universal</b> <b>version</b> of a primordial faith that was revealed {{many times before}} through prophets including Adam, Abraham, Moses and Jesus. As for the Quran, Muslims consider {{it to be the}} unaltered and final revelation of God. Like other Abrahamic religions, Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded paradise and unrighteous punished in hell. Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam, which are obligatory acts of worship, and following Islamic law, which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, from banking and welfare to women and the environment. The cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam.|$|E

She attempted to make another serious adaptation, but the studio decided that it should be a comedy rather than a drama. After some shooting by Weber, she thought some of the scenes to be shot were insulting to African Americans, including such [...] "racist humor as a stork dropping a black baby into a trash can". Topsy and Eva was reassigned to Del Lord to direct, with some additional scenes by D.W. Griffith.|$|E

This model is aimed at replacing the previous generation of Russian multiple rocket launchers, including BM-21 Grad, BM-27 Uragan and BM-30 Smerch. Currently the sole operator is Russian Ground Forces. A version will be proposed for export.|$|E

A <b>universal</b> <b>version</b> of Herky that could be used for all sports was needed. Native Iowa City artist Charles Reed based his drawing of Herky on two sources: former Hawkeye wrestler Barry Davis and cartoon character Mighty Mouse. Herky is also involved in occasional gimmicks, such as the Alumni Herky with a white beard who appears alongside the normal Herky at the annual homecoming game, and in 2010, a special Captain America-themed Herky was introduced during Iowa's football game with Michigan State.|$|E

5000|$|Postmodern {{critique}} - The {{basis of}} this critique is summed up by scholar, Seyla Benhabib. She sums it up by stating, [...] "transcendental guarantees of truth are dead;... there is only the endless struggle of local narratives vying with one another for legitimization." [...] What this says is that there cannot be one way that all people should act in certain circumstances, but rather studies and theories focused on the common good of the public majority. This critique also states {{that there is not}} any narrative in which we can base one <b>universal</b> <b>version</b> of truth in societies around the world. The moral ideals of the Enlightenment and Western liberal democracy are discredited by postmodernists.|$|E
50|$|The LRSVM Morava is a {{multiple}} rocket launcher system developed in Serbia. Designed as a modular, lightweight and <b>universal</b> <b>version</b> of the M-63 Plamen, M-77 Oganj and BM-21 Grad MLRS. It was first unveiled in 2011 as a more tactically and universal mobile version. It is developed by Military Technical Institute Belgrade (VTI) who has longtime experience in developing MLRS systems including most powerful at time of development 262mm M-87 Orkan. After successful transfer of technology and collaboration with UAE Emirates Defense Technologies in developing their MLRS based on Nimr platforms VTI has completed new universal modular MLRS dubed Morava. This model is aimed at replacing {{the current generation of}} Russian MLRS, including BM-21 Grad, and Serbian MLRS M-77 Oganj and M-63 Plamen in all version. There is a version designated for export.|$|E
50|$|Intel-based {{models that}} came with Mac OS X Tiger (10.4) or Leopard (10.5) preinstalled {{had to be able}} to boot from both APM and GUID disks due to the {{installation}} media for these universal versions of Mac OS X, which are APM partitioned in order to remain compatible with PowerPC-based systems. However, the installation of OS X on an Intel-based Mac demands a GUID partitioned disk or will refuse to continue, the same way installation on a PowerPC-based system will demand an APM partitioned destination volume. Cloning an already installed OS X to an APM partition on Intel systems will remain bootable even on 2011 Intel-based Macs. Despite this apparent APM support, Apple never officially supported booting from an internal APM disk on an Intel-based system. The one exception for a <b>universal</b> <b>version</b> of Mac OS X (Tiger or Leopard) is an official Apple document describing how to set up a dual bootable external APM disk for use with PowerPC and Intel.|$|E
