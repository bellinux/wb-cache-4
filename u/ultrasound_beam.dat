25|$|Sonopuncture is a {{stimulation}} of the body similar to acupuncture using sound instead of needles. This may be done using purpose-built transducers to direct a narrow <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beam</b> {{to a depth of}} 6–8 centimetres at acupuncture meridian points on the body. Alternatively, tuning forks or other sound emitting devices are used.|$|E
25|$|An {{echocardiogram}} can, {{within certain}} limits, produce an accurate {{assessment of the}} direction of blood flow and the velocity of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect. One of the limitations is that the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beam</b> should be as parallel to the blood flow as possible. Velocity measurements allow assessment of cardiac valve areas and function, abnormal communications between {{the left and right}} side of the heart, leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and calculation of the cardiac output. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound using gas-filled microbubble contrast media can be used to improve velocity or other flow-related medical measurements.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of a uterine fibroid versus an adnexal tumor is made. Fibroids can be mistaken for ovarian neoplasms. An uncommon tumor which may {{be mistaken for a}} fibroid is Sarcoma botryoides. It is more common in children and adolescents. Like a fibroid, it can also protrude from the vagina and is distinguished from fibroids. While palpation used in a pelvic examination can typically identify the {{presence of}} larger fibroids, gynecologic ultrasonography (ultrasound) has evolved as the standard tool to evaluate the uterus for fibroids. Sonography will depict the fibroids as focal masses with a heterogeneous texture, which usually cause shadowing of the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beam.</b> The location can be determined and dimensions of the lesion measured. Also, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to define the depiction of the size and location of the fibroids within the uterus.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} an {{apparatus}} for three-dimensional ultrasound imaging of a needle-like instrument, {{such as a}} biopsy needle, inserted in a human body. The instrument is visualized by transmitting <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beams</b> toward the instrument and then detecting the echo signals using a linear array of transducer elements. The problem of ultrasound being reflected from a biopsy needle {{in a direction away}} from the transducer array is solved by steering the transmitted <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beams</b> t increase the angle at which the beams impinge upon the biopsy needle. Ideally the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beams</b> are perpendicular to the needle. This increases the system 2 ̆ 7 s sensitivity to the needle because the reflections from the needle are directed close to the transducer array. This can be accomplished using either the B mode or the color flow mode of an ultrasound imaging system. The acquired data for multiple two-dimensional image frames is gathered in memory to form a data volume, which is then processed to form a three-dimensional image (by projection) or a two-dimensional slice taken at an angle through the data volume. In particular, a two-dimensional slice which is coplanar with inserted biopsy needle can be imaged...|$|R
30|$|The {{contrast}} agents eco-amplifiers {{are able}} to modify the acoustic impedance of tissues, interacting with <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beams</b> and increasing the echogenicity of the blood. The contrast media (CM) ultrasound (USCA, UltraSound Contrast Agent) consist of microbubbles containing inert gases and surrounded by membrane stabilizers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhen finite {{amplitude}} ultrasound propagation is considered, {{changes in}} spatial features of focused <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beams</b> can be observed. These nonlinear effects typically appear in thermoviscous fluids as focal displacements, beam-width variations or gain changes. However, in soft-tissue media, the frequency {{dependence of the}} attenuation doesn’t obey a squared law. In this way, these complex media response leads to weak dispersion that prevents the cumulative processes of energy transfer to higher harmonics. In this work we {{explore the influence of}} different frequency power law attenuation responses and its influence on the self-defocusing effects in focused <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beams.</b> Thus, we numerically explore the spatial field distributions produced by low-Fresnel number devices and High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) radiating trough different soft-tissue media...|$|R
25|$|Follow-up imaging {{in women}} of {{reproductive}} age for incidentally discovered simple cysts on ultrasound {{is not needed}} until 5cm, as these are usually normal ovarian follicles. Simple cysts 5to 7cm in premenopausal females should be followed yearly. Simple cysts larger than 7cm require further imaging with MRI or surgical assessment. Because they are large, they cannot be reliably assessed by ultrasound alone because {{it may be difficult}} to see the soft tissue nodularity or thickened septation at their posterior wall due to limited penetrance of the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beam.</b> For the corpus luteum, a dominant ovulating follicle that typically appears as a cyst with circumferentially thickened walls and crenulated inner margins, follow up is not needed if the cyst is less than 3cm in diameter. In postmenopausal patients, any simple cyst greater than 1cm but less than 7cm needs yearly follow-up, while those greater than 7cm need MRI or surgical evaluation, similar to reproductive age females.|$|E
500|$|The probe is an {{ultrasonic}} sensor, [...] generally {{known as}} a transducer, which functions to send and receive acoustic energy. The emission is generated on piezoelectric crystals by the piezoelectric effect. The reflected ultrasound is received by the probe, transformed into an electric impulse as voltage {{and sent to the}} engine for signal processing and conversion to an image on the screen. The depth reached by the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beam</b> is dependent on the frequency of the probe used. The higher the frequency the lesser the depth reached.|$|E
500|$|Ultrasonography {{is based}} on the {{principle}} that sound can pass through human body tissues and is reflected by the tissue interfaces {{in the same way that}} light can reflect back on itself, from a mirror. Tissue in the body will offer varying degrees of resistance, known as acoustic impedance, to the path of the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beam.</b> When there is a high impedance difference between two tissues, the interface between them will strongly reflect the sound. When the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beam</b> meets air, or solid tissue such as bone, their [...] impedance difference is so great that most of the acoustic energy is reflected making it impossible to see any underlying structures. The examiner will see just a shadow, instead of the image expected. Air will impede sound waves which is why a gel is used. The gel prevents air bubbles from forming between the probe, and the patient's skin and so helps the conduction of the sound waves from the transducer into the body. The watery medium also helps to conduct the sound waves. Liquids, including blood have a low impedance, which means that little energy will be reflected and no visualization possible. One of the important exceptions is that when the blood flow is very slow it can in fact be seen, in what is termed [...] "spontaneous contrast".|$|E
30|$|Ultrasound {{guidance}} allows probe insertion {{from every}} angle, offers real time visualization and correction for motion artifacts when targeting the tumor, and is low cost. However, the gas created during ablation (or {{ice in the}} case of cryoablation) hampers penetration of the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beams</b> in tissue, causing acoustic shadowing and obscuring image details like the delineation between tumor borders and ablation zone.|$|R

They represent an innovative technique deserving detailed assessment in vibro-acoustography applications. The system point-spread function (PSF) is {{defined in terms of}} the acoustic emission of a point-target in response to the dynamic ultrasound radiation force. This force is produced by two overlapping <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beams.</b> We calculate the radiation force on the target in a nonviscous fluid using the plane wave approximation for the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beams.</b> The beamforming of sector array transducers is analyzed through linear acoustics.

An experimental setup is design to validate the theory; the comparison is made using location and amplitude of sidelobes and spatial resolution defined by the PSF. Results show that the computed PSF is in full agreement with the PSF obtained experimentally. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The Tissue Doppler {{method is}} based on the colour Doppler, giving a {{velocity}} field with velocity vectors along the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beam</b> over the whole sector. It measures the velocity gradient between two points along the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beam</b> with a set distance. It gives the same result as the velocity gradient. This method has been validated experimentally in a mechanical model, in an animal model, and in patients against echocardiography, coronary angiography [...] and MR The method is limited to one direction; along the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beam,</b> can thus mainly be used from the apical window, and for longitudinal strain and strain rate measurements only. It is sensitive to angle deviation between the velocity vector (direction of motion) and the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beam,</b> and is sensitive to noise, especially clutter noise. It has a high temporal resolution, at the cost of a relatively low lateral spatial resolution.|$|E
50|$|One area of {{research}} in which attenuation figures strongly is in ultrasound physics. Attenuation in ultrasound is the reduction in amplitude of the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beam</b> {{as a function of}} distance through the imaging medium. Accounting for attenuation effects in ultrasound is important because a reduced signal amplitude can affect the quality of the image produced. By knowing the attenuation that an <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beam</b> experiences traveling through a medium, one can adjust the input signal amplitude to compensate for any loss of energy at the desired imaging depth.|$|E

50|$|Focused {{ultrasound}} using lower intensities, producing {{low temperature}} rise (hyperthermia) and/or mechanical agitation, {{can also be}} utilized to deliver drugs to the brain and other areas of the body. For example, focused <b>ultrasound</b> <b>beams</b> are being studied to temporarily open up the blood-brain barrier to enable delivery of drugs to diseased brain tissue. This technique involves infusing a therapeutic agent along with gas-filled microbubbles into the bloodstream. The ultrasound is then applied to target areas in brain, causing the bubbles to vibrate, loosening the tight junctions of the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels and allowing high concentrations of the drug to enter targeted tissues.|$|R
