Barge transport ended in the late 1990s. The automatic unloading equipment for the coal trains was built by Rhymney Engineering, a Powell Duffryn company. It used <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>detection,</b> capable of dealing with up to 99 wagons in a train (though initially trains had 35 hopper wagons), to control the door-opening gear to empty 5 wagons at a time into the bunkers.|$|E
50|$|Under ideal {{circumstances}} most detection {{techniques can}} be considered theoretically as interferometers and, as such, their ultimate sensitivities are all roughly equal. This is because, in all these techniques, interferometry is used to linearize the detection transfer function and when linearized, maximum sensitivity is achieved. Under these conditions, photon shot noise dominates the sensitivity and this is fundamental to all the optical detection techniques. However,the ultimate limit {{is determined by the}} phonon shot noise. Since the phonon frequency is many orders of magnitude lower than the photon frequency, the ultimate sensitivity of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>detection</b> can be muchhigher. The usual method for increasing the sensitivity of optical detection is to use more optical power. However, the shot noise limited SNR is proportional to the square root of the total detection power. Thus, increasing optical power has limited effect, and damaging power levels are easily reached before achieving an adequate SNR.Consequently, optical detection frequent has lower SNR than non-optical contacting techniques. Optical generation (at least in the firmly thermodynamic regime) is proportional to the optical power used and itis generally more efficient to improve the generation rather than the detection (again the limit is the damage threshold).|$|E

40|$|Laser <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>detection</b> is a {{versatile}} and highly sensitive {{tool for the}} observation of surface waves. In the following study, laser <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>detection</b> {{is used for the}} experimental study of spurious normal vibration modes of a disk quartz sensor excited by a voltage pulse. The AT cut crystal (cut of the crystal relative to the the main crystallographic axis is 35. 25) is optimal for generating mainly thickness–shear vibrations (central frequency 6 MHz) on the quartz surface. However, resulting from shear-to-longitudinal and shear-to-surface mode conversion, and from the weak coupling with the other crystallographic axes, other modes (thickness-compressional and bending modes) are always present in the plate response. Since the laser vibrometer is sensitive to normal displacements, the laser investigation shows waves that can be considered as unwanted for the AT quartz used as a shear sensor. The scanned three dimensional (3 D) amplitude–space–time signals are carefully analysed using their representation in three dual Fourier domains (space–time, wave number–frequency). Results on the transient analysis of the waves, the normal bending modes and the dispersion curves are shown. status: publishe...|$|E
