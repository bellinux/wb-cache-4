40|$|This study investigates learners‟ <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> {{scientific}} inquiry (NOSI) {{in relation to}} their classroom experiences. Using <b>the</b> constructs <b>of</b> nature of {{scientific inquiry}}; inquiry-based teaching and learning; and principles of scientific inquiry as theoretical lenses, the study empirically explored learners‟ (n = 120) <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> scientific inquiry which were captured through a questionnaire called Learners‟ <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> science and scientific inquiry (LUSSI) and interviews and their perceptions of classroom inquiry (their experiences of inquiry were elicited through a questionnaire called Principles of scientific inquiry- student (PSI-S) and interviews). The participants were one hundred and twenty learners, 60 from each of two schools in an Education District in Lesotho. Eight learners, four from each school participated in the interviews. At the centre, the investigation sought to understand whether there was any relationship between learners‟ perceptions of their experiences of scientific inquiry and their <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> scientific inquiry. As a result, this study was guided by the following questions: what are learners‟ <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> scientific inquiry? What are learners‟ perceptions of their experiences of scientific inquiry? Are learners‟ <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> NOSI in any way related to their experiences of scientific inquiry? Typological approach was used to analyse the qualitative data and descriptive statistics for analysing the quantitative data. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this study suggest that learners hold less informed <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> scientific inquiry and that learners are experiencing closed-inquiry in their science classroom. The results also show that other learners‟ experiences of scientific inquiry are not related to their <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> scientific inquiry. It was recommended that teachers should engage learners in inquiry activities rather than always carrying out teacher-demonstrations. It is also recommended that further studies should be done in Lesotho {{to examine the relationship between}} learners‟ <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> NOSI and their perceptions of their classroom experiences...|$|R

5|$|Sociologist Reiner Grundmann's {{review in}} BioSocieties journal, {{acknowledges}} that the book is well researched and factually based, but criticizes the book as being written in {{a black and white}} manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description. The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of basic <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political process and the mechanisms of knowledge policy, because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> science. While the book provides all the (formal) hallmarks of science, Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.|$|E
