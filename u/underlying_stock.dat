25|$|Another {{very common}} {{strategy}} is the protective put, {{in which a}} trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and buys a put. This strategy acts as an insurance when investing on the <b>underlying</b> <b>stock,</b> hedging the investor's potential loses, but also shrinking an otherwise larger profit, if just purchasing the stock without the put. The maximum profit of a protective put is theoretically unlimited as the strategy involves being long on the <b>underlying</b> <b>stock.</b> The maximum loss {{is limited to the}} purchase price of the <b>underlying</b> <b>stock</b> less the strike price of the put option and the premium paid.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the price and}} volume effects of <b>underlying</b> <b>stocks</b> around the announcement date of derivative warrants issued in Hong Kong. In general, {{the results indicate that}} <b>underlying</b> <b>stocks</b> are subject to extra buying pressure {{a few days before the}} new derivative warrant issuance, which is consistent with our hypothesis about the hedging effect created by the merchant banks that initiate the warrant issuance. Since the prices of <b>underlying</b> <b>stocks</b> peak on the first day after the warrant announcement and are stable thereafter, the information effect associated with the warrant issuance appears to be weak and does not last long. In addition, we find that <b>underlying</b> <b>stocks</b> have abnormal increases in price and volume during the last 5 minutes of trading on the warrant issuance day. This might be due to investors' buying behavior precipitated by information leakage about the successful warrant issuance and/or to the price manipulation by merchant banks in order to attain a better payoff from the warrant issuing business.

25|$|Reverse {{convertibles}} are a {{less common}} variation, mostly issued synthetically. They would be {{opposite of the}} vanilla structure: the conversion price would act as a knock-in short call option: as the stock price drops below the conversion price the investor would start to be exposed the <b>underlying</b> <b>stock</b> performance and {{no longer able to}} redeem at par its bond. This negative convexity would be compensated by a usually high regular coupon payment.|$|E
25|$|Call features: The {{ability of}} the issuer (on some bonds) to call a bond early for redemption. This should not {{be mistaken for a}} call option. A Softcall would refer to a call feature where the issuer can only call under certain circumstances, {{typically}} based on the <b>underlying</b> <b>stock</b> price performance (e.g. current stock price is above 130% of the conversion price for 20 days out of 30 days). A Hardcall feature would not need any specific conditions beyond a date: that case the issuer would be able to recall a portion or the totally of the issuance at the Call price (typically par) after a specific date.|$|E
25|$|The {{owner of}} an option may on-sell the option to a third party in a {{secondary}} market, in either an over-the-counter transaction or on an options exchange, depending on the option. The market price of an American-style option normally closely follows that of the <b>underlying</b> <b>stock,</b> being {{the difference between the}} market price of the stock and the strike price of the option. The actual market price of the option may vary depending on a number of factors, such as a significant option holder may need to sell the option as the expiry date is approaching and does not have the financial resources to exercise the option, or a buyer in the market is trying to amass a large option holding. The ownership of an option does not generally entitle the holder to any rights associated with the underlying asset, such as voting rights or any income from the underlying asset, such as a dividend.|$|E

Significant negative abnormal returns on both the announcement and listing date of derivative warrants are reported, followed by a negative price drift.

25|$|Closely {{following}} the derivation of Black and Scholes, John Cox, Stephen Ross and Mark Rubinstein developed {{the original version}} of the binomial options pricing model. It models {{the dynamics of the}} option's theoretical value for discrete time intervals over the option's life. The model starts with a binomial tree of discrete future possible <b>underlying</b> <b>stock</b> prices. By constructing a riskless portfolio of an option and stock (as in the Black–Scholes model) a simple formula can be used to find the option price at each node in the tree. This value can approximate the theoretical value produced by Black Scholes, to the desired degree of precision. However, the binomial model is considered more accurate than Black–Scholes because it is more flexible; e.g., discrete future dividend payments can be modeled correctly at the proper forward time steps, and American options can be modeled as well as European ones. Binomial models are widely used by professional option traders. The Trinomial tree is a similar model, allowing for an up, down or stable path; although considered more accurate, particularly when fewer time-steps are modelled, it is less commonly used as its implementation is more complex.|$|E
2500|$|Contingent {{conversion}} (aka CoCo): Restrict {{the ability}} of the convertible bondholders to convert into equities. Typically, restrictions would be based on the <b>underlying</b> <b>stock</b> price and/or time (e.g. convertible every quarter if stock price is above 115% of the conversion price). Reverse convertibles in that respect could be seen as a variation of a Mandatory bearing a contingent conversion feature based. More recently some CoCo's issuances have been based on Tier-1 capital ratio for some large bank issuers.|$|E
2500|$|For example, if {{a company}} has {{announced}} some bad news and its share price has dropped by 25%, but its CDS spread has remained unchanged, then an investor might expect the CDS spread to increase relative to the share price. [...] Therefore, a basic strategy would be to go long on the CDS spread (by buying CDS protection) while simultaneously hedging oneself by buying the <b>underlying</b> <b>stock.</b> [...] This technique would benefit {{in the event of}} the CDS spread widening relative to the equity price, but would lose money if the company's CDS spread tightened relative to its equity.|$|E

As nonparametric regression estimates we use least squares estimates with complexity penalties, which include as special cases least squares spline estimates, least squares neural networks, smoothing splines and orthogonal series estimates.

2500|$|The {{practice}} of short selling was likely invented in 1609 by Dutch businessman Isaac Le Maire, a sizeable shareholder of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC in Dutch).

Short selling can exert downward pressure on the <b>underlying</b> <b>stock,</b> driving down the price of shares of that security.

6000|$|The Wedgwood {{family were}} 'throwers' by handicraft, {{superior}} artisans long settled at Burslem, in the Staffordshire potteries. Josiah, {{the youngest of}} thirteen children, lamed by illness in early life, was turned by this happy accident from his primitive task as a 'thrower' to the more artistic and original work of producing ornamental coloured earthenware. Skilful and indefatigable, of indomitable energy and with great powers of forcing his way in life against all obstacles, young Wedgwood rose rapidly by his own unaided exertions to be a master potter, and a manufacturer of the famous unglazed black porcelain. Those were the darkest days of industrial art and decorative handicraft in modern England. Josiah Wedgwood, by his marked originality and force of character, succeeded in turning the current of national taste, and creating among us a new and distinctly higher type of artistic workmanship. His activity, however, was not confined to his art alone, but found itself a hundred other different outlets in the most varied directions. When his potteries needed enlargement to meet the increased demand, he founded for the hands employed upon his works the model industrial village of Etruria. When Brindley began cutting artificial waterways across the broad face of central England, {{it was in the}} great potter that he found his chief ally in promoting the construction of the Grand Trunk Canal. Wedgwood, indeed, was a builder of schools and a maker of roads; a chemist and an artist; a friend of Watt and an employer of Flaxman. In short, like Erasmus Darwin, he possessed that prime essential in the character of genius, an immense <b>underlying</b> <b>stock</b> of energy. And with it there went its best concomitant, the 'infinite capacity for taking pains.' Is it not probable that in their joint descendant, the brilliant but discursive and hazardous genius of Erasmus Darwin was balanced and regulated by soberer qualities inherited directly from the profound industry of the painstaking potter? When later on we find Charles Darwin spending hours in noting the successive movements of the tendrils in a plant, or watching for long years the habits and manners of earthworms in flower-pots, may we not reasonably conjecture that he derived no little share of his extraordinary patience, carefulness, and minuteness of handicraft from his mother's father, Josiah Wedgwood? ...|$|E
