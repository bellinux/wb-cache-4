5|$|After this, the alchemist Agathodaemon (around 300) {{spoke of}} a mineral that when mixed with natron {{produced}} a 'fiery poison'. He described this poison as 'disappearing in water', giving a clear solution. Emsley speculates that the 'fiery poison' was arsenic trioxide, the <b>unidentified</b> mineral having to have been either realgar or orpiment, due to {{the relation between the}} <b>unidentified</b> mineral and his other writings.|$|E
5|$|Air force experts raised {{questions}} and the Malaysian opposition leveled criticisms {{about the state of}} Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities. Many criticized the failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an <b>unidentified</b> aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace. The Malaysian military became aware of the <b>unidentified</b> aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance. The failure to recognise and react to the <b>unidentified</b> aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation.|$|E
5|$|An <b>unidentified</b> dark parrot seen {{alive by}} the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa {{was given the}} name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors {{believed}} {{it was from the}} Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description differs from that of the Mascarene parrot. This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations of the scientific names, such as Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura. The <b>unidentified</b> parrot may have been an African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) instead.|$|E
5|$|Dolfin is <b>unidentified,</b> but {{may have}} been a {{relation}} of Mac Bethad's enemy Crínán of Dunkeld, on the basis that some of Crínán's descendants may have borne this name.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{recovered}} from inflorescences include the banksia boring moth (Arotrophora canthelias), younger instars of which eat flower and bract parts before tunneling into the rachis {{as they get}} older and boring into follicles and eating seeds. This tunneling itself damages the architecture of the spike and prevents seed development. Other seed predators include <b>unidentified</b> species of moth of the genus Cryptophasa, as well as Scieropepla rimata, Chalarotona intabescens and Chalarotona melipnoa, Brachmia trinervis, Carposina hyperlopha and an <b>unidentified</b> weevil species.|$|E
5|$|Major {{anthocyanins}} in blackcurrant pomace are delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside {{which are}} {{retained in the}} juice concentrate among other yet <b>unidentified</b> polyphenols.|$|E

5|$|The Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, {{the twelve}} Apostles and an {{assortment}} of dignitaries are positioned at either side of Michael in a Deësis. The apostles are seated in a semicircle; Peter, dressed in red, is on the far left, and Paul, dressed in green, is on the far right. The seven haloed dignitaries, dressed in contemporary clothing, are <b>unidentified</b> but include a king, a pope, a bishop, a monk, and three women. Rather than general representative types, they are portraits of specific <b>unidentified</b> individuals, according to Shirley Blum.|$|E

5|$|In 1871 Beato {{served as}} {{official}} photographer with the United States naval expedition of Admiral Rodgers to Korea.

5|$|In 1904 {{residents}} of Monroe, Michigan, which includes {{much of the}} area of the battlefield, erected a monument to the Kentuckians who died defending their settlement during the various River Raisin engagements. Some <b>unidentified</b> victims were buried here.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl later {{claimed the}} reliefs on Tiki Makiʻi Tauʻa Pepe were llamas or pumas instead {{to bolster his}} theory that Polynesia was settled from South America. Later <b>unidentified</b> writers and rumors have insinuated that Heyerdahl {{deliberately}} altered and defaced the images in his process of restoring them.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, an <b>unidentified</b> {{arsonist}} {{destroyed the}} center. Construction {{on a new}} building began in April 2012, but in the interim, the center operated in Northeast Portland.

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{repatriate}} Koga's body, American author Jim Rearden led a search on Akutan in 1988. He located Koga's grave, but found it empty. Rearden and Japanese businessman Minoru Kawamoto conducted a records search. They found that in 1947 Koga's body was exhumed by an American Graves Registration Service team and re-buried on Adak Island, further down the Aleutian chain. The team, unaware of Koga's identity, marked his body as <b>unidentified.</b> The Adak cemetery was excavated in 1953, and 236 bodies were returned to Japan. The body buried next to Koga (Shigeyoshi Shindo) was one of 13 identified; the remaining 223 <b>unidentified</b> remains were re-interred in Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery in Japan. It is probable that Koga was one of them. Rearden later wrote the definitive account of the Akutan Zero.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the Orient Express {{begins with}} the Armstrong {{kidnapping}} redated and relocated in New Paltz, New York City, during 1924, in which police officers surround an <b>unidentified</b> house. After a brief gun battle, two men {{walk out of the}} house and surrender.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains <b>unidentified,</b> while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the <b>unidentified</b> man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist.|$|E
5|$|Ryan was {{involved}} in a three-car crash in eastern Pennsylvania on January 14, 2013. A witness said Ryan ran his Ford Mustang through a red light and collided with another driver which caused the <b>unidentified</b> driver to hit a third car. Ryan was issued a warning, but no citation.|$|E

5|$|The only Canadian, {{and also}} last known {{specimen}} {{of the sea}} mink (Mustela macrodon) was captured on Campobello Island, New Brunswick in 1894.

5|$|Throughout its {{period at}} Ubon, No.79 Squadron formed {{part of an}} {{international}} force tasked with defending Thailand's air space against intruders. At {{the start of the}} deployment, tensions in Thailand were such that the squadron's personnel believed that they were at war. While the situation became more stable from late July 1962, No.79 Squadron maintained armed aircraft on alert at all times and scrambled Sabres when <b>unidentified</b> aircraft were detected. No air attacks were conducted against Thailand, however, and the <b>unidentified</b> aircraft that were intercepted almost always proved to be from the Central Intelligence Agency-controlled Air America. In January 1965 two Sabres accidentally overflew North Vietnam after becoming lost during a training sortie but returned safely to Ubon.|$|E

5|$|A damaged, <b>un{{identified}}</b> vessel {{from the}} Gamma Quadrant docks at Deep Space Nine for repairs. Its reptilian pilot, identified only as Tosk (Scott MacDonald), {{is the first}} known life-form from the Gamma Quadrant to visit the station. Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) suspects Tosk is running from something, due to evidence of weapons fire on his vessel. O'Brien befriends Tosk and tries to help him repair his ship. However, Tosk attempts to steal from a weapons locker and is put in a holding cell by Security Chief Odo (René Auberjonois).|$|E

In 2007, a laelapid mite found on V.gymnocaudus in Anjanaharibe-Sud {{was described as a}} new species, Andreacarus voalavo.
