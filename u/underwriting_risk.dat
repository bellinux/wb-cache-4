50|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} factors that go into determining the <b>underwriting</b> <b>risk</b> on motorized vehicles are: performance capability and retail cost. The most commonly available providers of auto insurance have underwriting restrictions against vehicles that are either designed to be capable of higher speeds and performance levels, or vehicles that retail above a certain dollar amount. Vehicles that are commonly considered luxury automobiles usually carry more expensive physical damage premiums because they are more expensive to replace. Vehicles that can be classified as high performance autos will carry higher premiums generally because there is greater opportunity for risky driving behavior. Motorcycle insurance may carry lower property-damage premiums because the risk of damage to other vehicles is minimal, yet have higher liability or personal-injury premiums, because motorcycle riders face different physical risks while on the road. Risk classification on automobiles also takes into account the statistical analysis of reported theft, accidents, and mechanical malfunction on every given year, make, and model of auto.|$|E
40|$|Using {{the records}} of several leading 19 th century issuing houses, this paper {{analyses}} the transformation of underwriting practices in London's primary sovereign bond market from 1870 to 1914. It shows how <b>underwriting</b> <b>risk</b> developed from being a liability, which market intermediaries sought to avoid, to becoming a valuable financial commodity. The impetus for this development was increased competition in the loan business from the 1880 s onwards, which weakened the negotiating position of issuing houses and forced them to shoulder an increasing share of the <b>underwriting</b> <b>risk.</b> Issuing houses had to find methods {{to deal with this}} risk, but they were initially hamstrung by public perception of underwriting as detrimental to the interests of ordinary investors. Firms began to adopt informal underwriting arrangements, with limited scope, but these only allowed for a relatively limited distribution of <b>underwriting</b> <b>risk</b> to third parties, the danger of which was exposed during the Baring crisis. Consequently formal underwriting syndicates were developed, allowing for a greater dissemination of <b>underwriting</b> <b>risk.</b> This meant that the risk associated with issuing loans could be broken down into sufficiently small tranches so that no underwriter had to shoulder a risk greater than what he desired. As a result <b>underwriting</b> <b>risk</b> came {{to be seen as a}} profitable investment opportunity, a financial commodity in its own right, and a means of patronage for issuing houses...|$|E

40|$|Characteristics of {{the risk}} {{landscape}} have not changed radically. The major insurance hazards are still earthquake, windstorm, and flood. However, recent experiences suggest a change in profile from a few major losses to more frequent, less severe impacts, {{at least in terms}} of insurance costs. Insured values at risk are increasingly located in hazard-prone areas, and modern business practices mean that impact can be more economically severe as company operations become increasingly interdependent. At the same time, business interruption, as a class of insurance, has not been one of the insurance industry’s strengths, although increasing dependence on technology and networks heightens risk exposure. Nevertheless, in the midst of this, our perspective {{of the risk}} landscape is changing. The willingness and ability of companies to retain more of their own risk is increasing; and holders of risk are increasingly seeing less reason to differentiate between insurable risks, financial risks, and operational risks. Instead, they are looking to harmonise their treatment of risk: ‘Risk is risk’. Thus, corporations are combining insurance risks into multi-line or integrated programs. Similarly, insurance companies are increasingly taking a balance sheet view of their <b>risks,</b> managing <b>underwriting</b> and investment exposures in tandem rather than separately. As financial and <b>underwriting</b> <b>risks</b> come closer together, capital markets are more willing to <b>underwrite</b> <b>risk</b> directly. At the same time, capital has become mobile to the point of being global and over plentiful, as low interest rates show. This availability of capital has changed the nature of insurance, precipitating merger and acquisition activity. Hence, the main challenges to the insurance industry are determined by this combination of risk and capital...|$|R
