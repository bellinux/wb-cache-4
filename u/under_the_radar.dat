25|$|Ron Meyer was an up {{and coming}} coach that had {{previous}} coaching success at UNLV. During the 70s SMU drew decent crowds, {{and had a}} large fan base, but {{was in need of}} a spark. Ron Meyer was flashy, aggressive, and popular; he would be that spark. He was hired in the winter of 1976 (Pony Excess). Meyer’s first years on campus were not as successful as fans had hoped. From 1976 to 1979, the Mustangs had accumulated a record of 16-27; SMU football lacked talent and size. So, Ron Meyer began to assemble the best recruiting class ever. Before the famous 1979 class Ron Meyer’s first big recruit was Emmanuel Tolbert (1976) from Little Rock Central High School. The University of Arkansas, a much bigger University and a program that usually snatched recruits from their state had lost the speedy running back Tolbert to Meyer’s SMU. Meyer was gaining solid recruit after recruit <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar.</b> Former SMU quarterback Lance Mcilhenny says that Ron Meyer was the greatest salesman he’s ever met.|$|E

500|$|The album {{incorporates}} musical {{references to}} both older and contemporary hip hop. Its production features live instrumentation, orchestral music, R, and boom bap elements. Music journalist Evan Rytlewski denotes [...] "boom-bap drums, lush keyboards, smooth saxophones, {{and the occasional}} Run-D.M.C. and MC Shan sample" [...] to be [...] "tasteful accents" [...] from golden age hip hop.

500|$|This failure {{had three}} sources. First, {{there were the}} {{political}} constraints imposed by Washington that limited the entire American effort in Southeast Asia (the continued fiction of Laotian and Cambodian [...] "neutrality", failure to disrupt the trail with U.S. ground forces when {{it would have made}} a difference, etc.) The second source of the failure was the utilization of what Colonel Charles Morrison has called [...] "over-sophisticated methods" [...] against [...] "elemental systems." [...] The primitive logistical needs of the North Vietnamese (at least until the final phase of the conflict) allowed them to slip <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> of their more technologically sophisticated enemy. Finally, all of the above were exacerbated by the communist's enviable ability to adapt their doctrine and tactics and to turn weaknesses into strengths.|$|E

OK Computer was important because it reintroduced unconventional writing and song structures." [...] Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree added, [...] "I don't think ambition is a dirty word any more. Radiohead were the Trojan Horse in that respect.

500|$|In {{the context}} of this debate, music writers have {{interpreted}} Illmatic as an admonishment for hip hop purists and practitioners.
