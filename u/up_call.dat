Using the shuttle robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the crew went through a detailed inspection of the orbiter's thermal protection system (TPS) tile and Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) surfaces. During the inspection, engineers on the ground noticed a small area of tile on the forward area of the shuttle's right wing that appeared to have suffered some damage during ascent.|$|E
25|$|More {{change was}} in the offing, however. As the band {{concluded}} its world tour for Wake <b>Up</b> <b>Call</b> in 1994 and began looking to re-enter the studio, Hartman, the lone remaining founding member, decided to retire from touring. An era had ended.|$|E
25|$|The {{song was}} also played during every {{show of the}} 360° Tour. During the final leg of the tour in 2011, a {{recorded}} video from NASA astronaut Mark Kelly {{was used as a}} lead-in to the song.

25|$|Following {{the wake}} <b>up</b> <b>call,</b> the crew on board Discovery {{got to work}} {{preparing}} for entry. After the first landing opportunity was waved off due to high wind concerns, the team on the ground gave the crew a 'go' {{to proceed with the}} second opportunity. Following the deorbit burn, the orbiter landed successfully at 15:13 EDT.|$|E
25|$|The crew awakened at 4:59 UTC to {{a special}} message and a song from Sir Paul McCartney. The wake <b>up</b> <b>call</b> was 30 minutes later than Atlantis's crew had been {{scheduled}} {{in order to give}} them time to make up sleep they lost {{over the course of the}} night due to the failure of GPC-4. Early on the day, Atlantis commander Ferguson and pilot Hurley re-loaded software and successfully restarted the GPC-4. Flight controllers in Houston also downloaded data dumps to carefully monitor the computer to make sure that it was running normally.|$|E

On 6 December 1810, Hidalgo issued a decree abolishing slavery, threatening {{those who did not}} comply with death. He abolished tribute payments that the Indians had to pay to their creole and peninsular lords. He ordered the publication of a newspaper called Despertador Americano (American Wake <b>Up</b> <b>Call).</b> He named Pascacio Ortiz de Letona as representative of the insurgent government and sent him to the United States to seek support there, but Ortiz de Letona was apprehended by the Spanish army en route to Philadelphia and promptly executed.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the wake}} <b>up</b> <b>call,</b> the two crews {{got to work}} {{preparing}} for the mission's final spacewalk. Bowen and Kimbrough officially began the EVA at 18:24 UTC. Shortly before the spacewalk began, managers on the ground radioed up to the crew that the Mission Management Team had approved an extra docked day {{of operations for the}} crews, extending the mission to sixteen days. The extra time was being given to allow the crews more time to resolve the issues with the Urine Processing Assembly. The spacewalk successfully concluded after 6 hours and 7 minutes, bringing the total time spent in EVA activities for the mission to 26 hours, 41 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The two crews {{set to work}} {{following}} their wake <b>up</b> <b>call,</b> preparing for the first spacewalk of the mission. Swanson and Arnold exited the Quest airlock at 16:22 UTC to begin {{the installation of the}} S6 truss segment. Once Swanson and Arnold were in position, Phillips and Wakata remotely controlled the station's robotic arm, maneuvering the truss into its final position. Swanson and Arnold then bolted the truss into place, and connected power and data cables, which allowed the ground team to begin remote activation of the segment. The two spacewalkers also removed launch locks, stowed a keel pin, removed and jettisoned four thermal covers, and deployed the blanket boxes that hold the solar arrays in place during launch. The spacewalk ended at 21:11 UTC, for a total time of 6 hours, 7 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the crew}} wake <b>up</b> <b>call,</b> the two crews {{set to work}} on the day's planned activities. Fincke and Magnus tested latches on the Exposed Facility Berthing Mechanism for the Japanese Kibo laboratory. Magnus {{continued}} with the installation of the Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOCA), while engineers on the ground worked through troubleshooting of the Urine Processor Assembly. The component ran initially on Thursday evening, but shut itself down during that initial test, and shut down again the following morning after two hours of operations. Engineers were considering if the issue was a problem with the sensors, or with the centrifuge motor. At 17:10, Ferguson and Boe used the shuttle's engines to reboost the station's altitude, raising it by about one nautical mile to prepare for the next Progress arrival.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the wake}} <b>up</b> <b>call,</b> the two crews began the {{procedures}} {{to move the}} Leonardo MPLM out of the orbiter's payload bay to install it on the Earth-facing port of the Harmony module. Using the station's robotic arm, Pettit and Kimbrough began maneuvering the 27,000 lb container around 16:45 UTC, and by at 18:04 UTC it was locked in place. After performing leak checks, the hatch was opened at 23:43 UTC. The crews took air samples and examined the container for any signs of condensation or shifting of the contents during launch. The container had no issues, and transfer of cargo between the container and the station began shortly after the hatch was opened. The team also worked on experiments that were flown with Endeavour, including one that involves observing spiders and butterflies in space. The experiment from Florida, Texas and Colorado schoolchildren is being conducted to compare spider webs created in microgravity with those on Earth. The insects {{will be returned to}} Earth with the shuttle for additional study.|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on {{the success}} of the song in 2002, Vig admitted: [...] "People still ask us who the 'Stupid Girl' is, and that's {{impossible}} to answer. The song is sort of meant to be a wake <b>up</b> <b>call.</b> It could be about an ex-girlfriend. It could be about a rock diva that we all know, it could be about your sister. It could also be called 'Stupid Boy'." [...] Looking back, he also stated, [...] "It's impossible to predict what will be a hit. But subconsciously, I knew the song was good when I kept playing the same rough mix over and over again on my car stereo for months." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{featured}} in the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada during the scene where Andy arrives in Paris. Director David Frankel first used the song in a montage of pre-production scenes he shot on location in the city; the song fit the images so well {{that he decided to}} include it in the film. The film's use of the song was parodied in the 2009 The Simpsons episode [...] "The Devil Wears Nada"; [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] is played briefly as Homer and Carl arrive in Paris. The song was {{featured in}} [...] "I Love You Too," [...] a 2005 episode of the HBO series Entourage. In the sequence, U2 performs the song at a concert and Bono wishes a happy birthday to Johnny Chase. American sports network ESPN used [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] in their 2006 FIFA World Cup television commercials; the piece, titled [...] "Anthem," [...] featured narration about the sport by Bono, which was set against a montage of children playing football across the globe and [...] ESPN used the track for a second time in January 2010 in commercials for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, causing weekly online sales of the track to double from the month prior. In 2008, NASA used [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] for the fourth wake <b>up</b> <b>call</b> of STS-126. The song was played for Mission Specialist Shane Kimbrough. The song was used again on 3 March 2011 for the eighth wake <b>up</b> <b>call</b> of STS-133; it was played for all of the crew members.|$|E

500|$|Lewis and Audrey {{decide to}} rekindle their {{relationship}} in March 2012. Kate White from Inside Soap wrote that Audrey finds Lewis hard to resist, especially {{after he has}} apologised for his previous actions. When Lewis is wrongly accused of taking some money from The Bistro, he plans to leave Weatherfield. Nicholls told White that Audrey feels awful that she too accused Lewis {{and it is a}} wake <b>up</b> <b>call</b> for her as she does trust him. The actress said Audrey still fancies Lewis and does not want to lose him again. Lewis and Audrey spend the night together and decide to keep their relationship a secret, especially from Audrey's family, as his [...] "past indiscretions still loom over them like a dark cloud". Nicholls said Audrey could be making a mistake, and added, [...] "You read this sort of thing in the papers all the time, women of a certain age being charmed by these men. I'd ask her to think about what she's doing." [...] A writer for Inside Soap said that Audrey and Lewis are very happy as they [...] "bask in the warmth of their revived romance." [...] However, they have to resort to sneaky measures to spend time together to avoid upsetting Audrey's family. When Audrey calls in sick at the salon to spend time with Lewis, Gail and David become concerned and check up on her. They see Lewis leaving her house and realise the pair are back together.|$|E
500|$|Likewise, {{in their}} article [...] "Wake <b>up</b> <b>call</b> from 'Stars on the Ground'" [...] for the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, T. S. Sathyanarayana Rao and V. S. T. Krishna {{wrote that the}} film [...] "deserves to be vastly {{appreciated}} as an earnest endeavor to portray with sensitivity and empathetically diagnose a malady in human life". They also felt it blended [...] "modern professional knowledge" [...] with a [...] "humane approach" [...] in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the [...] "present age where everyone is in a restless hurry". The pair wrote, [...] "This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. We seem to be heading {{to a state of}} mass scale mindlessness even as children are being pushed to 'perform'. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?" [...] The film depicts how [...] "threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan [...] "dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities". Overall, the pair found a [...] "naive oversimplification" [...] in the film. With India [...] "only recently waking to recognizing the reality and tragedy of learning disability", however, they [...] "easily [...] under artistic license".|$|E
