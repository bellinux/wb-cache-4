5|$|Following the diminished {{influence}} of the ancient Priory, predecessor of the two parishes of St Bartholomew, disputes began to arise over rights to tithes and taxes payable by lay residents who claimed allegiance with the nearby and anciently associated parish of St Botolph Aldersgate — an <b>unintended</b> <b>consequence</b> and legacy of King Kenry VIII's religious reforms.|$|E
5|$|The {{indirect}} {{land use}} change impacts of biofuels, {{also known as}} ILUC, relates to the <b>unintended</b> <b>consequence</b> of releasing more carbon emissions due to land-use changes around the world induced by the expansion of croplands for ethanol or biodiesel production {{in response to the}} increased global demand for biofuels.|$|E
40|$|Given the {{increase}} in financial-incentive programs nationwide, many physicians and physician groups are concerned about potential <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences</b> of providing financial incentives to improve quality of care. However, few studies examine whether actual <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences</b> result from providing financial incentives to physicians. We sought to document {{the extent to which}} the <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences</b> discussed in the literature were observable in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of financial incentives. We conducted a qualitative observational study nested within a larger RCT of financial incentives to improve hypertension care. We conducted 30 -minute telephone interviews with primary care personnel at facilities participating in the RCT housed at 12 geographically dispersed Veterans Affairs Medical Centers nationwide. Participants answered questions about unintended effects, clinic team dynamics, organizational impact on care delivery, study participation. We employed a blend of inductive and deductive qualitative techniques for analysis. Sixty-five participants were recruited from RCT enrollees and personnel not enrolled in the larger RCT, plus one primary care leader per site. Emergent themes included possible patient harm, emphasis on documentation over improving care, reduced professional morale, and positive spillover. All discussions of <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences</b> involving patient harm were only concerns, not actual events. Several <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences</b> concerned ancillary initiatives for quality improvement (e. g., practice guidelines and performance measurement systems) rather than financial incentives. Many <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences</b> of financial incentives noted were either only concerns or attributable to ancillary quality-improvement initiatives. Actual <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences</b> included improved documentation of care without necessarily improving actual care, and positive <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences.</b> Clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT 00302718...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDrug control {{policies}} and interventions, {{like any other}} {{policies and}} interventions, generate many <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences.</b> Most often, such consequences are mentioned without being defined or presented in a typology and they are rarely {{explained in terms of}} causality. This paper will stress how the existing work on the <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences</b> of drug control policies and interventions suffers from little or no definition and will then provide such a definition and a typology applied to three major interventions meant to achieve drug crop reduction: forced eradication, alternative development, and opium bans. In the end it will explain how a typology of <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences</b> can help to better understand the failure and even the counterproductivity of some interventions. Differentiating between direct and collateral <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences</b> allows us to better attribute the occurring of <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences</b> to a specific intervention and, or, to the intended consequence of the interventions...|$|R

5|$|During the Russian Civil War, and {{immediately}} afterwards, the Commissariat usually confiscated property to support government operations. Following {{a short period}} of stability after the civil war the Commissariat introduced several governmental taxes on the population. The commissariat's structure differed little from its Tsarist predecessor, the only notable difference was that the Soviet ministry was very centralised while the Tsarist's finance ministry was a very decentralised one. The Commissariat, and later the Ministry, prepared the state budget in a joint process with its republican and local branches. The Ministry's structure went through few changes due to the Soviet government's conservative approaches to change. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced several reforms during his rule which had the <b>unintended</b> <b>consequence</b> of considerably hurting the ministry's prestige.|$|E
5|$|The author {{explores the}} {{question}} of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate by adults (including violence and pornography), arguing that youths are not endangered by sexually explicit material. Heins asserts that there is no simple tactic by which the government can censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She points out that although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually has the <b>unintended</b> <b>consequence</b> of harming them.|$|E
5|$|During the 1968 Democratic Convention, {{a motion}} {{had been passed}} to {{establish}} a commission to reform the Democratic Party nomination process. In 1969, McGovern was named chair of the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, {{also known as the}} McGovern–Fraser Commission; due to the influence of former McCarthy and Kennedy supporters on the staff, the commission significantly reduced the role of party officials and insiders in the nomination process, increased the role of caucuses and primaries, and mandated quotas for proportional black, female, and youth delegate representation. A somewhat <b>unintended</b> <b>consequence</b> of the commission's reforms was a massive {{increase in the number of}} presidential primaries; this became true for the Republican Party as well. The U.S.presidential nominating process has been different ever since, with scholars and politicians debating whether all the changes are for the better.|$|E

Some of the crew of U-552 survived the war, and her captain, Erich Topp, later became an Admiral in the post-war Bundesmarine.

25|$|Four {{important}} {{effects are}} worthy of brief mention. First, flood mitigation schemes, intended to protect infrastructure built on floodplains, have had the <b>unintended</b> <b>consequence</b> of reducing aquifer recharge associated with natural flooding. Second, prolonged depletion of groundwater in extensive aquifers can result in land subsidence, with associated infrastructure damage – as well as, third, saline intrusion. Fourth, draining acid sulphate soils, often found in low-lying coastal plains, can result in acidification and pollution of formerly freshwater and estuarine streams.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of external laws, claims and cultural mores either potentially or actually act to variously constrain the practices and observances of an indigenous society.

They may have a measurable effect, even where countered by other external influences and actions deemed beneficial or that promote indigenous rights and interests.|$|E

50|$|Wayne Cornelius studies two central theses {{regarding}} institutional {{response to}} increased {{movement of people}} across transnational borders. The first {{of these is the}} gap hypothesis which describes the dissonance between official immigration policies and real policy outcomes. Policy gaps are the result of <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences</b> and inadequate enforcement by the receiving society. Many reasons can explain <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences</b> of immigration policy. Governments with undefined or ambiguous stances toward immigration may propagate <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences,</b> and the reliance on flawed policies can further reduce the efficacy of institutional measures. Furthermore, political incoherency policy poses a greater challenge for the incorporation and enforcement of effective measures.|$|R
25|$|The Allies (mainly French and {{the growing}} American forces) counterattacked at the Second Battle of the Marne in July 1918. On 6 August 1918, Foch was made a Marshal of France. Along with the British commander, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, Foch planned the Grand Offensive, opening on 26 September 1918, {{which led to the}} defeat of Germany. After the war, he claimed to have {{defeated}} Germany by smoking his pipe. An <b>unintended</b> <b>consequence</b> of Foch's appointment was that he sheltered Haig from British political interference.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{addition}} of new head entries to the second edition, Giles kept the original 13,848 numerical arrangement owing to an <b>unintended</b> <b>consequence</b> (1912: viii). People in China were using the dictionary numbers as a Chinese telegraph code, that is, a character encoding index for telegraphs written in Chinese characters—analogous with modern Chinese input methods for computers. Another example of using Giles' 13,848 numbers to index characters is Vernon Nash's (1936) Trindex: an Index to Three Dictionaries or San zidian yinde 三字典引得, for A Chinese-English Dictionary, (1711) Peiwen Yunfu rime dictionary, and (1716) Kangxi Dictionary.|$|E
25|$|These form an {{organizing}} principle and unifying theme for Asimov's robotic-based fiction, appearing in his Robot series, the stories linked to it, and his Lucky Starr series of young-adult fiction. The Laws {{are incorporated into}} {{almost all of the}} positronic robots appearing in his fiction, and cannot be bypassed, being intended as a safety feature. Many of Asimov's robot-focused stories involve robots behaving in unusual and counter-intuitive ways as an <b>unintended</b> <b>consequence</b> of how the robot applies the Three Laws to the situation in which it finds itself. Other authors working in Asimov's fictional universe have adopted them and references, often parodic, appear throughout science fiction as well as in other genres.|$|E

25|$|The economy {{continued}} to industrialize and urbanize, with heavy industry – especially coal and steel – becoming {{important in the}} Ruhr, and manufacturing growing in the cities, the Ruhr, and Silesia. Perkins (1981) argues that more important than Bismarck's new tariff on imported grain was {{the introduction of the}} sugar beet as a main crop. Farmers quickly abandoned traditional, inefficient practices in favor of modern methods, including use of new fertilizers and new tools. The knowledge and tools gained from the intensive farming of sugar and other root crops made Germany the most efficient agricultural producer in Europe by 1914. Even so, farms were small in size, and women did much of the field work. An <b>unintended</b> <b>consequence</b> was the increased dependence on migratory, especially foreign, labor.|$|E
25|$|In 1937 Clarissa studied art in Paris. Her {{mother had}} asked the British Ambassador, Sir George Clerk, to keep a watchful eye on her, an <b>unintended</b> <b>consequence</b> of this being that she was taken under the wing of an Embassy press {{secretary}} who, with his wife, introduced her to a round of café society parties. Among the friends she made in Paris were the monocled Fitzroy Maclean, a future politician and adventurer who was then third secretary at the embassy, and the writer Marthe Bibesco. Together with two female contemporaries, she made {{a visit to the}} Folies Bergère, an unusual destination for sixteen-year-old girls, where the singer Josephine Baker, clad only in a circlet of bananas, became the first naked female body she had ever seen.|$|E
25|$|One <b>unintended</b> <b>consequence</b> {{resulting}} from the smashing of the 1877 Chicago railway strike with armed force was a radicalization of the labor movement in that city. As early as 1875 there had been established in Chicago a workers' militia known as the Lehr und Wehr Verein (Education and Defense Society) — a paramilitary organization which declared itself armed and ready to defend the working class against manifestations of state violence against striking workers and their political activities. These units of armed workmen drilled in public with rifles in hand, marching under the red flag, amidst public pronouncements that workers' militia groups would henceforth {{come to the aid}} of striking workers against the state militia in the event of a strike.|$|E
