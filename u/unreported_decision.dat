50|$|Five African American college {{students}} {{went to a}} department store in Columbia, South Carolina, {{and sat down at}} its lunch counter and waited for service. The department store allowed persons of all races to use all facilities except for the lunch counter, which served whites only. The store manager had arranged for police to be present for any sit-in demonstrators, and then, consistent with the restaurant's policy of refusing service to blacks, the restaurant manager requested the persons to leave. When they refused, they were arrested for breach of the peace and criminal trespass. At trial the defendants their arrest, prosecution, and conviction by the state for requesting service at a restaurant that refused service to African Americans would violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court convicted the students, and the Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed in an <b>unreported</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E

40|$|Although the Court of Appeal has {{previously}} provided judicial guidance on the grant of interim mandatory injunctions, {{it is remarkable}} that local authority on grants of final mandatory injunctions is almost non-existent. In relation to breaches of contractual obligations, this may be a matter of little note since the assistance of equity will be neither necessary nor sought given the adequacy of contractual damages as a remedy for most instances of breach. Nevertheless, in a series of <b>unreported</b> <b>decisions,</b> the High Court and the Court of Appeal may have made some rather surprising inroads into this small patch of wilderness in Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s legal landscape.

40|$|Much of the {{uncertainty}} in product simulation law rests on two broad policy issues inadequately addressed by the courts: Is product simulation law advanced by statutory and judicial uncertainty? Is the public interest in competition advanced by freedom to copy or is it advanced by protection of an investor 2 ̆ 7 s interest in his creation? The second issue follows directly from the first because the state of simulation law has been influenced directly by each individual court 2 ̆ 7 s view of competition. This Comment reviews the broad issues of competition and decisional certainty and traces their evolvement into the doctrine of unfair competition as applied to product simulation cases.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the coercive use of {{immigration}} status or “status coercion” in civil proceedings and negotiations is fundamentally unethical and potentially illegal. For attorneys attempting {{to take advantage of}} unauthorized immigration status, such conduct very likely violates an attorney 2 ̆ 7 s ethical obligations under the Rules of Professional Responsibility and wrongfully takes advantage of an overly vulnerable population. For the judiciary, the article argues for a more proactive approach in maintaining the perception of fairness and justice in civil proceedings for all parties, regardless of immigration status. Additionally, for both legal and lay persons, status coercion may constitute the crime of extortion, and this article establishes how status coercion in most cases fills the required elements of extortion. Part I of the article discusses in reported and <b>unreported</b> <b>decisions</b> the various fora where the described harms most often occur, including specifically commercial disputes, custody litigation and employment law issues where case outcomes have hinged on immigration status, and analyzes the impetus for the harms and the consequences, where appropriate, of the same. Part II of the article looks at ethical obligations, primarily those imposed by the Rules of Professional Responsibility on attorneys and the Model Code of Judicial Conduct for judges. Part II also looks in a more narrow perspective at potential criminal prohibitions and sanctions regulating this type of behavior affecting all parties. Part III suggests potential remedies available to the unauthorized immigrant in both civil and immigration proceedings when faced with status coercion. Part IV concludes that current ethical and legal obligations imposed on community members should be sufficient to prevent status coercion in commercial and civil contexts {{in the vast majority of}} cases. The article concludes that as unauthorized immigrants are one of the most vulnerable and susceptible populations to harm done to them, the ethical rules governing lawyers and judges should clearly state, and be understood, as prohibiting this type of coercion...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Thesis is to trace the history of {{judicial}} constructions of inherent patentability in the patent systems of Australia, the United Kingdom and, by operation of the Convention on the Grant of European Patents (`EPC'), the European Patent Organization. Inherently patentable subject matter is subject matter the characteristics of which are considered at law to make it inherently suitable for patent protection. Historically, the basic subject matter of patent protection has been the invention, {{and the concept of}} inherent patentability has been understood with reference to the distinction between inventions on one hand, and discoveries and other inherently noninventive subject matter on the other. The same distinction applies to varying degrees in contemporary Australian, United Kingdom, and EPC law by virtue of the express requirement in each of those jurisdictions for an invention that is patentable. It should be emphasised, however, that whilst the term `invention' has long been used to denote inherently patentable subject matter, the relevant legal concept is inherent patentability, and it is the development of that concept that has led legal understandings of the term `invention' rather than vice versa. The historical analysis of inherent patentability undertaken in this Thesis is presented in two Parts. The focus of the first Part (Chapters 1 - 3) is on Anglo-Australian law, meaning the law of the United Kingdom prior to its adoption of the EPC in 1977 and Australian law to date. The focus of the second Part (Chapters 4 - 6) is on the law of the European Patent Organization and the United Kingdom since its adoption of the EPC in 1977. In Chapter 1 I consider the origins of the common law invention and its development until 1623, when the Statute of Monopolies 1623 (Eng) was enacted and the foundations of the modern Australian and United Kingdom patent systems established. In Chapters 2 and 3 I analyze the development of inherent patentability within the Anglo-Australian patent system from commencement of the Statute of Monopolies to the present. In Chapter 4 I consider the origins of the model of inherent patentability adopted by the Contracting States of the EPC (including the United Kingdom) in the mid- 1970 s, and in Chapters 5 and 6 I analyze the development of inherent patentability {{in the hands of the}} United Kingdom courts and the European Patent Office. My purpose in writing this Thesis has not been to argue the case for the contemporary patent system's accommodation (or otherwise) of one or more classes of subject matter, but rather to explore and analyse the evolution of the threshold requirement of patentability in each of the jurisdictions considered. To that end I have focused primarily on the (reported and <b>unreported)</b> <b>decisions</b> of the courts, as well as selective decisions of patent administrators. In the case of the EPC I have relied on the decisions of the Boards of Appeal, with additional reference to decisions of the first instance departments of the European Patent Office where appropriate. I have also relied on background legislative material and related historical sources, and on the work of other academics in the area. A bibliography of the sources I have used appears after the main text. On matters of style and citation the Thesis complies with the Australian Guide to Legal Citation, with additional guidance, where necessary, from the 17 th edition of The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation. A final point should be made regarding my citation of cases in Chapter 2. For reasons of brevity I have given only one citation for each of the cases referred to in that Chapter. Despite this, many of the cases are reported in several different nominate (that is, pre- 1865 `named' English) reports, and many of those reports have since been reprinted in the English Reports or All England Reports Reprint and, most usefully, in the 11 volumes of Hayward's Patent Cases 1800 - 1883 (1987). With the assistance of those volumes I have compiled a more complete list of citations for the cases relied on, which is included in the bibliography.

40|$|Consultation {{with another}} {{physician}} {{is considered to}} be an important safeguard of the practice of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The objective is to describe the frequency and characteristics of consultation in cases of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) in the Netherlands. Data from two cross-sectional descriptive nationwide surveys, carried out in 1995, were used. Questionnaires were mailed to physicians attending 6060 deaths, identified from death certificates, and a stratified sample of 405 physicians were interviewed. In 1990, a cross-sectional descriptive postal survey of a random sample of 1042 general practitioners took place. Consultation took place in 63 % of cases of EAS in the Netherlands, in 99 % of the cases reported to the public prosecutor and in approximately 37 % of unreported cases. In almost half of the <b>unreported</b> cases the <b>decision</b> had been discussed less formally with at least one colleague. In 1990, 7 % of general practitioners met all 8 criteria for good consultation; this increased to 64 % in 1995. Of the respondents, 26 % had at some time advised against performing euthanasia or assisted suicide when acting as a consultant. This study shows that approximately two thirds of all cases of EAS are safeguarded by consultation. Although in the majority of these cases the consultation is of good quality, there is certainly still room for improvement. The quality of consultation could be improved, for instance, by appointing independent and specifically trained consultants. Euthanasia Assisted suicide Consultation...|$|R
40|$|A new and {{separate}} opportunity for oppression exists because LLC law purports to (1) recognize {{a species of}} persons holding legal rights vis-á-vis the LLC (assignees) while (2) denying those persons any remedies whatsoever in connection with those rights. This article addresses the conceptual mechanics, history, and ultimate instability of that denial. The article also considers a note of irony­—namely, that {{the plight of the}} 2 ̆ 2 bare naked assignee 2 ̆ 2 derives from a construct, the organization as 2 ̆ 2 aggregate, 2 ̆ 2 that LLC law has in all other respects emphatically transcended. To understand the plight of the assignee of an LLC interest, one must first understand a bit of partnership law and history. Part II provides that necessary foundation, acknowledging that assignee vulnerability is a built-in aspect of partnership law. Part III examines how partnership law and even the original Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (ULLCA) limited that vulnerability, at least theoretically, and how the notion of a partnership with a perpetual term eliminated even that theoretical limit. Part IV describes and characterizes the state of affairs for assignees under LLC law, explains the countervailing practical concerns (2 ̆ 2 freeze the deal 2 ̆ 2 versus 2 ̆ 2 oppression unlimited 2 ̆ 2), and shows how the drafters of the newest uniform LLC Act (Re-ULLCA) chose to 2 ̆ 2 punt 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 other law. 2 ̆ 2 Part V provides two different conceptual approaches for use by 2 ̆ 2 other law. 2 ̆ 2 One approach assumes that under LLC law a member 2 ̆ 7 s assignment of rights constitutes an assignment of contractual rights under the operating agreement. The other approach assumes that the assignment is merely a transfer of property rights vis-á-vis the LLC. In its own way, each approach could equip courts with sufficient authority in 2 ̆ 2 extreme and sufficiently harsh circumstances [...] . to expropriation. 2 ̆ 2 Part VI provides an account of an <b>unreported</b> trial court <b>decision,</b> in which the judge fashioned a remedial approach worth considering and concludes with the author 2 ̆ 7 s suggestion for further refining that approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of industrial safety law in Britain and New Zealand and {{the origins of}} construction, safety law are outlined in Part I. The administration and interpretation of the Construction Act 1959 are described in Part II, and Part III highlights the comparable statute law in three Commonwealth countries. The thesis will assist persons engaged in industry, lawyers and departmental officers {{in the understanding of}} the law and its application to construction work. The information presented on overseas law will assist those involved in the task of reviewing and consolidating the New Zealand industrial safety, health and welfare legislation. The history of the British Factories Acts leading on to the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, described in Chapter 1, highlights the importance of a self-regulating, integrated statutory system and a professional inspectorate with an advisory role and residual enforcement powers. New Zealand safety law has developed as the country's industrial needs have determined, as will be seen from Chapter 2. Generally, British statutes have been adopted, but construction safety law is the exception and Chapter 3 shows that, from the earliest Bill introduced by Richard John Seddon in 1892 up to the present, the legislation covering the construction industry has been initiated and drafted with industry representation. The more empirical subjects such as current policy and practice, sanctions, codes, education, other legislation and reform, as well as the purpose, effect, extent and application of the Construction Act 1959 are discussed in Chapter 4. The results of the author's legal research and analysis are contained in Chapters 5 and 6 under the headings of 'Liabilities' and 'Technical Law'. The responsibilities of employers, workmen, safety supervisors, inspectors and the Crown are set out and explained in terms of the statute and the interpretation from the case law. The technical subjects include scaffolding, guardrails, brittle roofing, fall of objects, access, excavations, mechanical plant, demolition, eye protection, asbestos, work in compressed air, health and welfare. Chapters 7, 8 and 9 examine the present legislation, in Britain, Australia and Canada and indicate a trend towards a unified approach to occupational safety, health and welfare and one enactment for all places of work, and with separate regulations and codes of practice for each industry. This study has been carried out by the present Chief Safety Engineer of the Department of Labour who has been responsible for the administration of the Construction Act 1959 since 1968. A separately bound appendix includes a copy of the Construction Act 1959 and the Amendments (Appendix A), the Inspection of Building Appliances Bill 1892 (Appendix B), the Scaffolding Inspection Act 1906 (Appendix C), the Tasmanian Industrial Safety, Health and Welfare Act 1977 (Appendix D), the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act 1978 (Appendix E), and copies of the <b>unreported</b> judgments and <b>decisions</b> referred to in the thesis (Appendix F) ...|$|R
