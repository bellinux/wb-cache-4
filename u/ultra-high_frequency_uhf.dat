40|$|A novel {{micromachining}} {{technology on}} SOI substrates is presented that {{is capable of}} producing on-chip high-Q resonators and resonator arrays equipped with high aspect-ratio (30 : 1) microstructures and nano-gap capacitive transducers filled with high-k dielectrics. The newly developed IC-compatible MEMS microfabrication process consists of merely three standard photolithography steps, which is much simpler than the other SOI-based resonator device technologies. In order to achieve the optimum performance and yield of the resonators and resonator arrays, this SOI-based fabrication process has been carefully designed and investigated step by step. For capacitively-transduced extensional mode (e. g., radial-contour and wine-glass mode) resonators, formation of nano-scale capacitive gaps and large resonator-to-electrode overlap area is essential for reducing the motional resistance Rx and DC bias voltage by strengthening the capacitive transduction. Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) technology with superb conformability and uniformity as well as outstanding thickness controllability is used to deposit the ultra-thin layer (~ 10 nm) of high-k dielectric material that acts as the solid capacitive gaps, which allows the mass production of on-chip capacitively-transduced resonators and resonator arrays with greatly enhanced electromechancial coupling coefficient, and thus lower motional resistance and DC bias voltage. Using this technique, high-Q micromechanical resonators and resonator arrays on SOI substrates operating at <b>ultra-high</b> <b>frequencies</b> (<b>UHF)</b> have been developed. The ultimate goal of this project is to implement on-chip narrow-band micromechanical filters with unprecedented frequency selectivity and ultra-low insertion loss. By fine-tuning the nonlinear characteristics of the capacitive transducers enabled by the new SOI technology, novel on-chip mechanical signal processors for frequency manipulation, such as mixer and multiplier, will be investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based pressure-sensing system to increase the range of current Intra-Ocular Pressure (IOP) sensing systems is described in this dissertation. A large number of current systems use near-field inductive coupling for the transfer of energy and data, which limits the operational range to only a few centimeters and {{does not allow for}} continuous monitoring of pressure. Increasing the powering range of the telemetry system will offer the possibility of continuous monitoring since the reader can be attached to a waist belt or put on a night stand when sleeping. The system developed as part of this research operates at <b>Ultra-High</b> <b>Frequencies</b> (<b>UHF)</b> and makes use of the electromagnetic far field to transfer energy and data, which increases the potential range of operation and allows for the use of smaller antennas. The system uses a novel electrically small antenna (ESA) to receive the incident RF signal. A four stage Schottky circuit rectifies and multiplies the received RF signal and provides DC power to a Colpitts oscillator. The oscillator is connected to a pressure sensor and provides an output signal frequency that is proportional to the change in pressure. The system was fabricated using a mature, inexpensive process. The performance of the system compares well with current state of the art, but uses a smaller antenna and a less expensive fabrication process. The system was able to operate over the desired range of 1 m using a half-wave dipole antenna. It was possible to power the system over a range of at least 6. 4 cm when the electrically small antenna was used as the receiving antenna...|$|R

40|$|Indoor {{localization}} {{has become}} increasingly important for sports analysis, automation {{as well as for}} mass market products like entertainment systems. For such applications, an increasing accuracy of a few centimeters or even millimeters is desired. But it is a huge challenge to develop a positioning system of that high accuracy in an indoor environment with severe multipath characteristics. A high precision real-time indoor positioning system (IPS) was designed, implemented and tested which is capable to achieve a position accuracy in sub-centimeter range. The proposed system implements the positioning based on time difference of arrival (TDoA) technology with the usage of on-off keying (OOK) modulated <b>ultra-high</b> <b>frequency</b> signals (<b>UHF)</b> {{in order to deal with}} multipath interference and achieve the high positioning precision.

[...] Seven years later, on November 5, 1961, WUHF took to the air for the first time. Through the Municipal Broadcasting System, which held the channel 31 license, the City (led by then-mayor Robert F.

5000|$|<b>Ultra-high</b> <b>frequency</b> (<b>UHF)</b> radios, at the time, {{were neither}} {{practical}} nor affordable {{for the average}} consumer. On September 11, 1958 the Class D CB service was created on 27 MHz, and this band became what is popularly known today as [...] "Citizens Band". There were only 23 channels at the time; the first 22 {{were taken from the}} former amateur radio service 11-meter band, and channel 23 was shared with radio-controlled devices. Some hobbyists continue to use the designation [...] "11 meters" [...] to refer to the Citizens Band and adjoining frequencies. Part 95 of the Code of Federal Regulations regulates the Class D CB service, on the 27 MHz band, since the 1970s and continuing today. Most of the 460-470 MHz band was reassigned for business and public-safety use; Class A CB is the forerunner of the General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS). Class B CB is a more distant ancestor of the Family Radio Service. The Multi-Use Radio Service is another two-way radio service in the VHF high band. An unsuccessful petition was filed in 1973 to create a Class E CB service at 220 MHz, which was opposed by amateur radio organizations and others. There are several other classes of personal radio services for specialized purposes (such as remote control devices).|$|E

The cosmonauts knew that the spacecraft had major safety problems, but Komarov stated {{that if he were}} to refuse to fly, Gagarin would be forced to go instead. [...] Komarov chose to fly to protect Gagarin, and insisted before the flight that his funeral be open-casket so that the Soviet leadership could see what they had done. [...] During the preparations for the spaceflight, both cosmonauts were working twelve- to fourteen-hour days. On orbital insertion, the solar panels of the Soyuz module failed to fully deploy thereby preventing the craft from being fully powered and obscuring some of the navigation equipment. Komarov reported: [...] "Conditions are poor. The cabin parameters are normal, but the left solar panel didn't deploy. The electrical bus is at only 13 to 14 amperes. The HF (high frequency) communications are not working. I cannot orient the spacecraft to the sun. I tried orienting the spacecraft manually using the DO-1 orientation engines, but the pressure remaining on the DO-1 has gone down to 180." [...] Komarov tried unsuccessfully to orient the Soyuz module for five hours.

40|$|Alternative housing {{systems for}} laying hens are {{increasingly}} {{adopted by the}} US egg industry. However, information still lacks with regards to behavioral and production responses of the hens to resources allocation in such alternative housing systems. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the nesting behavior and the location of eggs laid in an enriched colony housing (ECH) system. The experiment was conducted in laboratory scale, involving an ECH commercial module with the capacity of 60 hens per colony. The nesting behaviors were evaluated using an <b>ultra-high</b> <b>frequency</b> radio-frequency identification (<b>UHF</b> RFID) system that consists of four antennas located inside the nest box, one reader, and 60 individual transponders (one per bird) attached to the hen legs. The following behaviors were quantified: time spent in the nest box, maximum number of hen occupancy, oviposition time and place, daily number of visits to the nest box, and number of visits per egg laid in the nest box. Preliminary results to date show that laying hens in the ECH spent on average 56 (± 5) (mean ±SE) minutes inside nest box during laying or exploring visits and made an average of 17. 8 (± 1. 4) visits per day. The number of visits per egg laid in the nest box was 21. 3 (± 0. 6). The maximum occupancy averaged 11. 0 (± 0. 5) birds, which occurred within 5 - 6 hours after the light was turned on.
