The western boundary is far less certain, as the mountains gradually decline in height and grade into the rest of the Allegheny Plateau.

25|$|The {{free end}} of the dog (called the hammer) rests on the {{soundboard}} of the hurdy-gurdy and {{is more or less}} free to vibrate. When the wheel is turned regularly and not too fast the pressure on the string (called the trompette on French instruments) holds the bridge in place, sounding a drone. When the crank is striken, the hammer lifts <b>up</b> <b>suddenly</b> and vibrates against the soundboard, producing a characteristic rhythmic buzz that is used as an articulation or to provide percussive effect, especially in dance pieces.|$|E
25|$|Capone became {{increasingly}} security-minded and desirous of {{getting away from}} Chicago. As a precaution, he and his entourage would often show <b>up</b> <b>suddenly</b> at one of Chicago's train depots and buy up an entire Pullman sleeper car on a night train to Cleveland, Omaha, Kansas City, Little Rock, or Hot Springs, where they would spend a week in luxury hotel suites under assumed names. In 1928, Capone paid $40,000 to beer magnate August Busch for a 14-room retreat at 93 Palm Avenue on Palm Island, Florida in Biscayne Bay between Miami and Miami Beach. He never registered any property under his name. He did not even have a bank account, but always used Western Union for cash delivery, not more than $1,000.|$|E

25|$|On July 12, 1993, Allison boarded {{his newly}} {{acquired}} Hughes 369HS helicopter {{to fly to}} Talladega Superspeedway to watch family friend Neil Bonnett and his son David test a car for David's Busch Series debut. He picked up another family friend, racer Red Farmer, {{en route to the}} track. Allison was attempting to land the helicopter inside a fenced-in area of the track infield when the craft nosed <b>up</b> <b>suddenly,</b> then crashed. The National Transportation Safety Board blamed the crash on Allison's inexperience in helicopters, coupled with the decision to attempt a landing. Neil Bonnett freed the semi-conscious Farmer from the wreckage, but Allison was unresponsive and could not be freed until paramedics arrived. Farmer went on to a lengthy but successful recovery, but Allison never regained consciousness after sustaining a critical head injury. He was pronounced dead at 7:00a.m. the next morning by a neurosurgeon at Carraway Methodist Medical Center in Birmingham after a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain proved unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|The {{absence of}} {{mosquitoes}} from Iceland and similar regions is {{probably because of}} quirks of their climate, which differs in some respects from mainland regions. At {{the start of the}} uninterrupted continental winter of Greenland and the northern regions of Eurasia and America, the pupa enters diapause under the ice that covers sufficiently deep water. The imago ecloses only after the ice breaks in late spring. In Iceland however, the weather is less predictable. In mid-winter it frequently warms <b>up</b> <b>suddenly,</b> causing the ice to break, but then to freeze again after a few days. By that time the mosquitoes will have emerged from their pupae, but the new freeze sets in before they can complete their life cycle. Any anautogenous adult mosquito would need a host to supply a blood meal before it could lay viable eggs; it would need time to mate, mature the eggs and oviposit in suitable wetlands. These requirements would not be realistic in Iceland and in fact the absence of mosquitoes from such subpolar islands is in line with the islands' low biodiversity; Iceland has fewer than 1,500 described species of insects, many of them probably accidentally introduced by human agency. In Iceland most ectoparasitic insects live in sheltered conditions or actually on mammals; examples include lice, fleas and bedbugs, in whose living conditions freezing is no concern, and most of which were introduced inadvertently by humans.|$|E
500|$|An {{official}} {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World states: [...] "Jack Thorne, a young artist, finds his efforts unappreciated, {{and he and his}} wife and little daughter {{are on the verge of}} starvation. The final blow comes when his last painting, on which he had built much hope, was rejected by a rich man, whom an artist chum kindly brought to the impoverished studio. Jack decides that he can struggle no longer. Unseen by his wife, he picks up his revolver, puts it in his pocket and goes out, intending to end everything. But his little daughter has watched him; she follows him and stays his hand. Her prayers and entreaties bring him to a realization of what his rash act would mean to the two helpless ones that would be left behind. Penitent and remorseful, he accompanies his child back to their poor home. There he confesses to his wife that it was only the child's timely interference that saved him from ending it all. The mother drops on her knees beside her child, and clasping her in her arms, raises grateful eyes to Heaven in a prayer of thankfulness. Jack, looking <b>up</b> <b>suddenly,</b> sees the beautiful group of mother and child, with a light as if from Heaven upon them. Realizing that [...] is the inspiration and subject for which he has sought in vain, he calls for them not to move, and at once begins his great painting of them, which brings him fame and wealth." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a {{consequence}} night time sleep {{does not include}} as much deep sleep, so the brain tries to [...] "catch up" [...] during the day, hence EDS. People with narcolepsy may visibly fall asleep at unpredicted moments (such motions as head bobbing are common). People with narcolepsy fall quickly into {{what appears to be}} very deep sleep, and they wake <b>up</b> <b>suddenly</b> and can be disoriented when they do (dizziness is a common occurrence). They have very vivid dreams, which they often remember in great detail. People with narcolepsy may dream even when they only fall asleep for a few seconds. Along with vivid dreaming, people with narcolepsy are known to have audio or visual hallucinations prior to falling asleep.|$|E

2500|$|Propriety did {{not prevent}} him from {{engaging}} {{in a number of}} extramarital liaisons with various women that were chronicled in his diary, often in some detail, and generally using a cocktail of languages (English, French, Spanish, and Latin) when relating the intimate details. The most dramatic of these encounters was with Deborah Willet, a young woman engaged as a companion for Elisabeth Pepys. On 25 October 1668, Pepys was surprised by his wife as he embraced Deb Willet; he writes that his wife [...] "coming <b>up</b> <b>suddenly,</b> did find me imbracing the girl con [...] my hand sub [...] su [...] coats; and endeed I was with my main [...] in her cunny. I was at a wonderful loss upon it and the girl also...." [...] Following this event, he was characteristically filled with remorse, but (equally characteristically) continued to pursue Willet after she had been dismissed from the Pepys household.|$|E

After being prohibited from making television appearances of any kind until May, O'Brien spoke about the Tonight Show conflict on the CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes on May 2, 2010. During the interview with Steve Kroft, O'Brien said the situation felt [...] "like a marriage breaking <b>up</b> <b>suddenly,</b> violently, quickly.

However, Conan said he did not feel he got shafted. [...] "It's crucial to me that anyone seeing this, if they take anything away from this, it's I'm fine. I'm doing great," [...] said O'Brien.

2500|$|In response, the Admiralty issued orders on 10 February 1915 which {{directed}} merchant {{ships to}} escape from hostile U-boats when possible, but [...] "if a submarine comes <b>up</b> <b>suddenly</b> close ahead of you with obvious hostile intention, steer straight for her at your utmost speed..." [...] Further instructions ten days later advised armed steamers to open fire on a submarine {{even if it had}} not yet fired. Given the extreme vulnerability of a submarine to ramming or even small-caliber shellfire, a U-boat that surfaced and gave warning against a merchantman which had been given such instructions was putting itself in great danger. The Germans knew of these orders, even though they were intended to be secret, copies having been obtained from captured ships and from wireless intercepts; Bailey and Ryan in their [...] "The Lusitania Disaster", put much emphasis on these Admiralty orders to merchantmen, arguing it was unreasonable to expect a submarine to surface and give warning under such circumstances. In their opinion this, rather than the munitions, the nonexistent armament, or any other suggested reason, is the best rationale for the Germans' actions in the sinking.|$|E
