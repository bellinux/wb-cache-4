[...] Rabbi Schneerson also encouraged people to focus on Messiah very much.

60|$|The {{conception}} of the Sun's constitution thus set forth, is like that of M. Faye {{in so far as}} the successive changes, the resulting structures, and the <b>ultimate</b> <b>state,</b> are concerned; but unlike it in so far as the Sun is supposed to have reached a later stage of concentration. As I gather from your abstract of M. Faye's paper [this referred to an article in The Reader], he considers the Sun to be at present a gaseous spheroid, having an envelope of metallic matters precipitated in the shape of luminous clouds, the local dispersions of which, caused by currents from within, appear to us as spots; and he looks forward to the future formation of a liquid film as an event that will soon be followed by extinction. Whereas the above hypothesis is that the liquid film already exists beneath the visible photosphere, and that extinction cannot result until, in the course of further aggregation, the gaseous nucleus has become so much reduced, and the shell so much thickened, that the escape of the heat generated is greatly retarded.... M. Faye's hypothesis appears to be espoused by him, partly because it affords an explanation of the spots, which are considered as openings in the photosphere, exposing the comparatively non-luminous gases filling the interior. But if these interior gases are non-luminous from the absence of precipitated matter, must they not for the same reason be transparent? And if transparent, will not the light from the remote side of the photosphere seen through them, be nearly as bright as that of the side next to us? By as much as the intensely-heated gases of the interior are disabled by the dissociation of their molecules from giving off luminiferous undulations, by so much must they be disabled from absorbing the light transmitted through them. And if their great light-transmitting power is exactly complementary to their small light-emitting power, there seems no reason why the interior of the Sun, disclosed to us by openings in the photosphere, should not appear as bright as its exterior.|$|E

6000|$|It came, of a sudden, {{when all}} other thought was spent. She had been asking herself why, if her case was grave--and {{she knew what}} she meant by that--he should have talked to her at all about what she might with {{futility}} [...] "do"; or why on the other hand, if it were light, he should attach an importance to the office of friendship. She had him, with her little lonely acuteness--as acuteness went during the dog-days in the Regent's Park--in a cleft stick: she either mattered, and then she was ill; or she didn't matter, and then she was well enough. Now he was [...] "acting," [...] as they said at home, as if she did matter--until he should prove the contrary. It was too evident that a person at his high pressure must keep his inconsistencies, which were probably his highest amusements, only for the very greatest occasions. Her prevision, in fine, of just where she should catch him furnished the light of that judgment in which we describe her as daring to indulge. And the judgment it was that made her sensation simple. He had distinguished her--that was the chill. He hadn't known--how could he?--that she was devilishly subtle, subtle exactly in the manner of the suspected, the suspicious, the condemned. He in fact confessed to it, in his way, as to an interest in her combinations, her funny race, her funny losses, her funny gains, her funny freedom, and, no doubt, above all, her funny manners--funny, like those of Americans at their best, without being vulgar, legitimating amiability and helping to pass it off. In his appreciation of these redundancies he dressed out for her the compassion he so signally permitted himself to waste; but its operation for herself was as directly divesting, denuding, exposing. It reduced her to her <b>ultimate</b> <b>state,</b> which was that of a poor girl with her rent to pay for example--staring before her in a great city. Milly had her rent to pay, her rent for her future; everything else but how to meet it fell away from her in pieces, in tatters. This was the sensation the great man had doubtless not purposed. Well, she must go home, like the poor girl, and see. There might after all be ways; the poor girl too would be thinking. It came back for that matter perhaps to views already presented. She looked about her again, on her feet, at her scattered, melancholy comrades--some of them so melancholy as to be down on their stomachs in the grass, turned away, ignoring, burrowing; she saw once more, with them, those two faces of the question between which there was so little to choose for inspiration. It was perhaps superficially more striking that one could live if one would; but it was more appealing, insinuating, irresistible, in short, that one would live if one could.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of vertical, horizontal and moment (VHM) loads {{acting on a}} shallow foundation is complex, and {{it is becoming increasingly}} popular to represent <b>ultimate</b> limit <b>states</b> under general VHM loading as failure envelopes in three-dimensional load space. General loading is of particular interest offshore, where harsh environmental conditions lead to large horizontal and moment foundation loads. Shallow foundations with peripheral skirts that penetrate into the seabed are used to resist large lateral and overturning forces. During undrained loading, tensile resistance can be mobilised {{on the underside of the}} base plate by suctions developed within the skirt compartment. This paper presents failure envelopes and kinematic mechanisms for undrained <b>ultimate</b> limit <b>states</b> of circular skirted foundations in uniform and heterogeneous deposits under general VHM loading based on finite element results.
