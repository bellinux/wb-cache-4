25|$|<b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>lamps</b> {{are used}} to {{sterilize}} workspaces and tools used in biology laboratories and medical facilities. Commercially available low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps emit about 86% of their radiation at 254 nanometers (nm), with 265nm being the peak germicidal effectiveness curve.

5000|$|While {{this process}} {{may not have}} the {{permanence}} of other processes such as platinum or palladium printing, it is much less expensive and more user friendly. The core resource used is silver sulphamate (NH2SO3Ag) which can be prepared on site from sulphamic acid. The sensitizer used is very slow, so printing must be by contact with a large format negative, using an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lamp</b> or sunlight.|$|R

50|$|In {{managing}} M. rotundata for pollination, such methods as dichlorvos pest {{strips and}} <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lamps</b> placed above liquid traps {{are effective in}} killing parasitoids but not harming M. rotundata.

For example, the presence of thick artificial cavities separating the exterior from the nest and application of a felt cloth sealing {{to the back of}} the nesting board prevents parasitoid access to the nest. Another way that pest are controlled is by opening up the nesting material and cleaning the cocoons.|$|E
