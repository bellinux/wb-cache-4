40|$|In this study, we {{analyze the}} {{interference}} pattern of multi-user direct sequence ultra-wideband (DS-UWB) signals on unified S-band telemetry tracking and control (<b>USB</b> TT and <b>C)</b> systems. Due to the overlay nature of UWB signals, it’s inevitable that UWB signals will cause interference to <b>USB</b> TT and <b>C</b> systems. Compared to the bandwidth of DS-UWB signals, <b>USB</b> TT and <b>C</b> {{can be regarded}} as a narrowband system and there are two main interference patterns: pulse interference and white noise interference, which is determined by some of the parameters of two systems. Hence, the relationship between these parameters and the interference pattern can be analyzed and use the results to design two systems to cause minimum interference and achieve spectrum coexistence...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Poikiloderma {{is defined}} as a chronic skin {{condition}} presenting with a combination of punctate atrophy, areas of depigmentation, hyperpigmentation and telangiectasia. In a variety of hereditary syndromes such as Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), Clericuzio-type poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN) and Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC), poikiloderma occurs as one of the main symptoms. Here, we report on genotype and phenotype data of a cohort of 44 index patients with RTS or related genodermatoses. METHODS DNA samples from 43 patients were screened for variants in the 21 exons of the RECQL 4 gene using PCR, SSCP-PAGE analysis and/or Sanger sequencing. Patients with only one or no detectable mutation in the RECQL 4 gene were additionally tested for variants in the 8 exons of the <b>USB</b> 1 (<b>C</b> 16 orf 57) gene by Sanger sequencing. The effect of novel variants was evaluated by phylogenic studies, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) databases and in silico analyses. RESULTS We identified 23 different RECQL 4 mutations including 10 novel and one homozygous novel <b>USB</b> 1 (<b>C</b> 16 orf 57) mutation in a patient with PN. Moreover, we describe 31 RECQL 4 and 8 USB 1 sequence variants, four of them being novel intronic RECQL 4 sequence changes that may have some deleterious effects on splicing mechanisms and need further evaluation by transcript analyses. CONCLUSION The current study contributes to the improvement of genetic diagnostic strategies and interpretation in RTS and PN that is relevant in order to assess the patients' cancer risk, to avoid continuous and inconclusive clinical evaluations and to clarify the recurrence risk in the families. Additionally, it shows that the phenotype of more than 50...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{embedded}} system design, managing communication among various bus interfaces and attaching multiple systems with different interfacing protocols to a main processor {{is one of}} the challenging tasks. Popular serial interfacing protocols include: <b>USB,</b> I 2 <b>C,</b> SPIISSP, CAN and UART for communication between integrated circuits for low/medium data transfer speed with on board peripherals. This paper presents a platform which deals with the implementation of certain of the above serial protocols presented by a low power 32 -bit ARM RISC processor: LPC 2148, with suitable examples, including hardware and software details. This platform is also useful for students of different disciplines to work with different serial protocols, which helps them in interfacing of sensors, memory ICs, analog subsystems and so on. It also aims to provide the students with hands on experience, practices in {{embedded system}}s and minimizing the prerequisite knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Good quality entropy {{sources are}} {{indispensable}} in most modern cryptographic protocols. Unfortunately, many currently deployed networked devices {{do not include}} them and may be vulnerable to Random Number Generator (RNG) attacks. Since most of these systems allow firmware upgrades and have serial communication facilities, the potential for retrofitting them with secure hardware-based entropy sources exists. To this aim, very low-cost, robust, easy to deploy solutions are required. Here, a retrofittable, sub 10 $ entropy source based on chaotic dynamics is illustrated, capable of a 32 kbit/s rate or more and offering multiple serial communication options including <b>USB,</b> I 2 <b>C,</b> SPI or USART. Operation {{is based on a}} loop built around the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) hosted on a standard microcontroller. Comment: 4 pages, 6 figures.

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} a Distributed Wiring Harness (DWH) philosophy {{that will allow}} subcontractors to perform “pre-integration” testing of the electrical and data interfaces of their components (with the actual spacecraft) while the components {{are still on the}} manufactures’ benches. Through the use of a Universal Power and Data Controller (UPDC) and ICD Tracking Tool, each subsystem that is not being developed next to the main spacecraft bus (e. g. at a different subcontractor’s facility) can be “pre-integrated” and tested remotely. Full I 2 <b>C,</b> <b>USB,</b> serial and TCP/IP data connections (and later, SpaceWire) can be supported between the subsystem manufacture’s facility and the spacecraft bus location. Power draw valuess from the remotely located component will also be “transferred” to the flight computer on the spacecraft bus. Early integration and testing of the data and electrical interfaces on any mission will reduce errors between subcontractors, enable simulations even during the prototyping phase, and allow for more timely decision making when evaluating subsystem readiness...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} first portable, binaural, {{real-time}} research platform compatible with Oticon Medical SP and XP generation cochlear implants. The platform consists of (a) {{a pair of}} behind-the-ear devices, each containing front and rear calibrated microphones, (b) a four-channel <b>USB</b> analog-to-digital converter, (<b>c)</b> real-time PC-based sound processing software called the Master Hearing Aid, and (d) USB-connected hardware and output coils capable of driving two implants simultaneously. The platform is capable of processing signals from the four microphones simultaneously and producing synchronized binaural cochlear implant outputs that drive two (bilaterally implanted) SP or XP implants. Both audio signal preprocessing algorithms (such as binaural beamforming) and novel binaural stimulation strategies (within the implant limitations) can be programmed by researchers. When the whole research platform is combined with Oticon Medical SP implants, interaural electrode timing can be controlled on individual electrodes to within ± 1 [*]µs and interaural electrode energy differences can be controlled to within ± 2 %. Hence, this new platform is particularly well suited to performing experiments related to interaural time differences in combination with interaural level differences in real-time. The platform also supports instantaneously variable stimulation rates and thereby enables investigations such as the effect of changing the stimulation rate on pitch perception. Because the processing can be changed on the fly, researchers can use this platform to study perceptual changes resulting from different processing strategies acutely...|$|R
