50|$|Tyuyamunite (pronounced tuh-YOO-ya-moon-ite) is a {{very rare}} uranium mineral with formula Ca(UO2)2V2O8·(5-8)H2O. It {{is a member of}} the {{carnotite}} group. It is a bright, canary-yellow color because of its high <b>uranium</b> <b>content.</b> Also, because of tyuyamunite's high <b>uranium</b> <b>content,</b> it is radioactive. It was named by Konstantin Avtonomovich Nenadkevich, in 1912, after its type locality, Tyuya-Muyun, Fergana Valley, Kyrgyzstan.|$|R

50|$|Intragranitic veins form in {{the late}} phase of magmatic {{activity}} when hot fluids derived from the magma precipitate uranium on cracks within the newly formed granite. Such mineralisation contributed much to the uranium production of France. Veins hosted by metasedimentary units in the exocontact of granites {{are the most important}} sources of uranium mineralisation in central Europe including the world class deposits Schneeberg-Schlema-Alberoda in Germany (96,000 t <b>uranium</b> <b>content)</b> as well as Pribram (50,000 t <b>uranium</b> <b>content)</b> and Jachymov (~10,000 t <b>uranium</b> <b>content)</b> in the Czech Republic. Also they are closely related to the granites, the mineralization is much younger with a time gap between granite formation and mineralisation of 20 million years. The initial uranium mineralisation consists of quartz, carbonate, fluorite and pitchblende. Remobilsation of uranium occurred at later stages producing polymetal veins containing silver, cobalt, nickel, arsenic and other elements. Large deposits of this type can contain more than 1,000 individual mineralized veins. However, only 5 to 12% of the vein areas carry mineralization and although massive lenses of pitchblende can occur, the overall ore grade is only about 0.1% uranium.|$|R

5000|$|This {{involves}} {{inspection of}} a polished slice of a material {{to determine the}} density of [...] "track" [...] markings left in it by the spontaneous fission of uranium-238 impurities.

This causes induced fission of 235U, {{as opposed to the}} spontaneous fission of 238U. The fission tracks produced by this process are recorded in the plastic film. The <b>uranium</b> <b>content</b> of the material can then be calculated from the number of tracks and the neutron flux.|$|R

50|$|The {{mineralisation}} is {{hosted by}} Palaeozoic meta-black shales and Meta-basalts. Uranium mineralisation occurs in irregular shaped bodies of highly variable size and <b>uranium</b> <b>content</b> (in average 70 tonnes of uranium per body).

Remobilsation was caused by hydrothermal and supergene processes leading to the further enrichment of uranium. The background <b>uranium</b> <b>content</b> in the black shales is 40 to 60 ppm.

40|$|Rock {{and water}} samples were {{collected}} from the Morey Peak 152 ̆ 7 quadrangle in the northern Hot Creek Range, Nye County, Nevada. The water was analyzed for trace element content. The rock samples were analyzed for oxide composition, selected trace element composition, and K-U-Th content. Water sampled from spings, hot springs, and creeks had temperatures ranging between 8 and 60 (DEGREES) C, conductance between 100 and 1, 800 mhos, pH between 5. 4 and 8. 7, and Eh between - 106 and - 301 mv. The water sample set is rich in fluorine although no fluorite has yet been reported from rocks of the area. The fluorine and lithium are being added to the hydrologic system by hot springs. There is an anomalous occurrence of antimony {{on the west side}} of Hot Creek Canyon. Tin, recorded in varying concentrations, does not reflect the tin-sulfosalt assemblage of the Morey Camp area. Zinc content correlates with water from Paleozoic terranes. <b>Uranium</b> <b>content</b> of the water varies between 1 and 19 ppb. The <b>uranium</b> <b>content</b> of these waters is enriched over world averages. The average <b>uranium</b> <b>content</b> of water associated with individual ash-flow sheets increases with decreasing age of the unit. The best correlation of uranium is with selenium although there is a minor positive correlation with pH, Eh, molybdenum, and lithium. Factor analysis of the sample set reveals a U-Li-Se association and also identifies oxidized galena in solution. This analysis suggests that water need only be analyzed for copper, lithium, selenium, uranium, and vanadium in an uranium exploration program. Oxide analyses of these samples show gross similarities to other volcanic suites in central Nevada. The samples, on the average, are enriched in arsenic (to 666 ppm). Copper content varies between 4 and 185 ppm. The rocks of the Morey area are depleted in fluorine although the waters are enriched. An anomalous lithium value is associated with uranium mineralization in Corral Canyon. These rocks are enriched in molybdenum, selenium, tin, and slightly enriched in lead. <b>Uranium</b> <b>contents</b> of samples vary between 1 and 49 ppm. <b>Uranium</b> <b>content</b> of individual ash-flow sheets increases with decreasing age of the unit. Correlation coefficients indicate that in this area uranium is independent of any of the tested variables. Factor analyses suggest that there is an association between beryllium and uranium, arsenic and uranium, and selenium and uranium. The K-U-Th analyses yielded a wide variance of measurements. Potassium content ranges between 0 and 7. 66...|$|R
