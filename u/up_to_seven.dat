Aircraft pilots may also require assessment for surgery.|$|E
5|$|An inquest into Lynott's {{death was}} held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003. The hearing was told that marks found {{on her back and}} an arm may have been bruising, but the {{pathologist}} who conducted the original post mortem could not be sure how she had died, because her body had lain undiscovered for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> days. It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The inquest jury returned an open verdict.|$|E
5|$|Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may {{go through}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> nymphal stages (instars), {{requiring}} {{a meal of}} blood each time. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs {{over the course of}} her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and detach to molt into nymphs. Both male and female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which is unique to argasid ticks.|$|E

5|$|Certain genera of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, {{can form}} highly resistant, dormant {{structures}} called endospores. In almost all cases, one endospore is formed {{and this is}} not a reproductive process, although Anaerobacter can make <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> endospores in a single cell. Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat. Dipicolinic acid is a chemical compound that composes 5% to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores. It is implicated as responsible for the heat resistance of the endospore.|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the second}} lightest element and {{is the second}} most {{abundant}} in the observable universe. Most helium was formed during the Big Bang, but new helium is being created {{as a result of the}} nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth, helium is relatively rare and is created by the natural decay of some radioactive elements because the alpha particles that are emitted consist of helium nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations of <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> percent by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{developed}} as an Alberta clipper-type {{low pressure area}} that moved southeastward across the Great Plains and Midwest. Throughout North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, moderate snowfall accompanied the system. After weakening over the Ohio Valley, the storm redeveloped {{off the coast of}} North Carolina. In the days preceding the event, a cyclone over eastern Canada circulated cold air southward. Computer models indicated the potential for a major storm <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> days in advance; however, initially, certain forecasts suggested that a separate storm over the southern U.S. would merge with the clipper. Instead, this feature moved out to sea.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} area {{residents}} initiated {{an effort to}} have the former West Michigan Pike designated {{what is now called}} a Pure Michigan Byway. The designation would prioritize the area for historic preservation grants. A Preserve America grant funded a survey from June 2007 through September 2010, the results of which were a set of reports through the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office on the historical nature of the West Michigan Pike. In 2011, the group {{was in the process of}} securing resolutions from municipalities along the highway in support of the designation. According to officials working on the byway, it can take <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> years to complete the process. The initial proposals had the byway continuing to Mackinaw City, but as approved in 2016, it runs from New Buffalo on I-94 to Ludington, following US31 except between business loops at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehall–Montague and Pentwater.|$|E
