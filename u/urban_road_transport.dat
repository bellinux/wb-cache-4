40|$|Electric freight {{vehicles}} {{have the}} potential to mitigate local <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> emissions, but their numbers are still insignificant. Logistics companies often consider electric vehicles as too costly compared to vehicles powered by combustion engines. Research within the body of the current literature suggests that increasing the driven mileage can enhance the competitiveness of electric freight vehicles. In this paper we develop a numeric simulation approach to analyze the cost-optimal balance between a high utilization of medium-duty electric vehicles – which often have low operational costs – and the common requirement that their batteries will need expensive replacements. Our work relies on empirical findings of the real-world energy consumption from a large German field test with medium-duty electric vehicles. Our results suggest that increasing the range to the technical maximum by intermediate (quick) charging and multi-shift usage is not the most cost-efficient strategy in every case. A low daily mileage is more cost-efficient at high energy prices or consumptions, relative to diesel prices or consumptions, or if the battery is not safeguarded by a long warranty. In practical applications our model may help companies to choose the most suitable electric vehicle for the application purpose or the optimal trip length from a given set of options. For policymakers, our analysis provides insights on the relevant parameters that may either reduce the cost gap at lower daily mileages, or increase the utilization of medium-duty electric vehicles, in order to abate the negative impact of <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> on the environment...|$|R

The inventory is established for the reference year 2000 and it has 10 km spatial resolution. Annual anthropogenic emission data obtained from official national emission inventories and from international emission databases were spatially disaggregated and allocated to a gridded domain using the top-down methodology. Source specific temporal profiles were used in order monthly and hourly emission data to be estimated. In the study area, the highest NOx amounts are emitted by the maritime and <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> sectors. <b>Road</b> <b>transport</b> has a prominent role in anthropogenic NMVOCs emissions followed by the solvent and other product use sector.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} global climate change, anthropogenic emissions of fossil carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{need to be}} cut drastically. <b>Road</b> <b>transport</b> is {{a major source of}} CO 2 emissions, and in <b>urban</b> areas <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> also involves problems such as congestion, noise and particle emissions. Stockholm, the Swedish capital and one of the busiest regions in Sweden, has the ambition to be a pioneer in addressing environmental problems; CO 2 emissions in particular. One of the political visions incorporated in Stockholm’s environmental work is to achieve a practically renewable transport system by 2030. This study investigates if there are favourable conditions to achieve a renewable <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> system in Stockholm by 2030. Three aspects are considered; technology, private economy and regional planning policy. The study is based on three sub-studies, one for each aspect, and conclusions are drawn from the integration of the sub-studies. A scenario assessment implies that the technology to transit to a completely renewable <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> system could exist, and that a mix of technologies would be preferable. Cost optimisations show that renewable fuels and electric vehicles are cost-competitive given certain incentives. Hence, private persons could shift their transportation choices towards alternative vehicles and fuels. Interviews with regional institutional actors and analysis of regional planning documents reveal that integrating energy and transport systems in planning policy could enable the transition to a renewable <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> system in Stockholm. The work has been carried out under the auspices of The Energy Systems Programme (primarily financed by The Swedish Energy Agency). The study concludes that favourable conditions for a renewable <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> system do exist.

40|$|AbstractIn {{twenty of}} the {{countries}} composing the European Union (EU 20), there are approximately 800, 000 buses, equivalent to 0. 35 % of the total road vehicle fleet (230 million vehicles), while 10 % of road trips are made by bus. Given these rates, bus crashes account for very few events, involving less than 1 % of total road fatalities (ERF, 2010). It is evident that despite the significance of crashes involving buses and the assumption that public <b>transport</b> improves <b>road</b> safety by reducing vehicular traffic, few studies {{are available in the}} literature on crash data involving buses.

Specific objectives of the study includes to determine the emission level in the country, to evaluate the GWP and to develop a emission mapping network on trunk A roads in Nigeria. Accurate information on these emissions is required to strengthen the mitigation and adaptation ability of the country to tackle climate change. The study relied on direct measurement technique supported by literature as well as questionnaires administered on the organised vehicle fleet operators and road traffic management agency as data gathering methods. Also, detailed analysis of questionnaires responses was carried out. Results show that <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> account for over 14 % of greenhouse gases. Survey findings indicate that excessive smoke emission offence accounts for 1 - 2 % of the annual road traffic offences in Nigeria. Using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 16, five fitted simple linear regression models were developed.

The combination of methods could bridge the implementation gap between scenario-based research and actual policy implementation and thus increase the chances of research being implemented in practice. In the case study, backcasting identifies a need for diverse fuels and vehicles and for immediate policy action. However, analysis of policy integration demonstrates that such action is unlikely given current policy structures. The fundamental lack of integration between energy and transport policy obstructs measures to increase the use of renewable fuels and more energy-efficient vehicles, which in turn obstructs the reduction of CO 2 emissions from transport. The combination of backcasting and policy analysis is demonstrated to improve our understanding of the prerequisites for transitioning to a system based on renewable energy, and could thus be useful in further research...|$|E
