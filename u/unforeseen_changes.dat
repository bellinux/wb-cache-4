Anty had but little innate respect for gentry; and, though she feared her brother's displeasure, she felt no degradation {{at the idea of}} uniting herself to a man in Martin Kelly's rank. She could not, however, be brought to tell her brother openly, and declare her determination; and Martin had, at length, {{come to the conclusion that}} he must carry her off, before delay and <b>unforeseen</b> <b>changes</b> might either alter her mind, or enable her brother to entice her out of the country.|$|E

5000|$|Inaccurate counts are a {{main reason}} why tools {{can be left}} behind. Many cases of a {{retained}} instrument originally reported a correct sponge count when the patient was released. [...] An inaccurate count can occur when nurses are deprived of sleep, when the operation is particularly difficult, long, and mentally draining, when the operation is an emergency, or when there are <b>unforeseen</b> <b>changes</b> in the procedure. [...] An increased amount of chaos and distractions lead to {{a higher risk of}} a surgeon forgetting a tool. Mark Hulse from North Shore Medical Center said the following about surgery; “It’s a process that’s definitely subject to interruption and can be prone to errors. You’re doing a hundred other things at the same time, and as much as you try to keep your attention on it counts if the surgeon needs something, it’s easy to get distracted.” Some aspects of surgery that can add to chaos are performing <b>unforeseen</b> <b>changes</b> in the procedure and undergoing emergency surgery. [...] Consequently, the emergency room is the place most likely to make mistakes.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 17th century the {{prosperity}} {{and growth of}} Edo had begun to produce <b>unforeseen</b> <b>changes</b> in the Tokugawa social order. The chōnin, who were theoretically {{at the bottom of}} the Edo hierarchy (shinōkōshō, samurai-farmers-craftsmen-merchants, with chōnin encompassing the two latter groups), flourished socially and economically at the expense of the daimyo and samurai, who were eager to trade rice (the principal source of domainal income) for cash and consumer goods. Mass-market innovations further challenged social hierarchies. For example, vast Edo department stores had cash-only policies, which favored the chōnin with their ready cash supply.|$|E
50|$|The non-virtual {{interface}} pattern (NVI) controls how {{methods in}} a base class are overridden. Such methods {{may be called}} by clients and overridable methods with core functionality. It is a pattern that is strongly related to the template method pattern. The NVI pattern recognizes {{the benefits of a}} non-abstract method invoking the subordinate abstract methods. This level of indirection allows for pre and post operations relative to the abstract operations both immediately and with future <b>unforeseen</b> <b>changes.</b> The NVI pattern can be deployed with very little software production and runtime cost.

50|$|A {{resilient}} {{supply network}} effectively aligns its strategy, operations, management systems, governance structure, and decision-support capabilities {{so that it}} can uncover and adjust to continually changing risks, endure disruptions to its primary earnings drivers, and create advantages over less adaptive competitors. Moreover, it has the capability to respond rapidly to <b>unforeseen</b> <b>changes,</b> even chaotic disruption. The resilience of a supply network is the ability to bounce back - and, in fact, to bounce forward with speed, determination and precision. In recent studies, resilience is regarded as the next phase in the evolution of traditional, place-centric enterprise structures to highly virtualized, customer-centric structures that enable people to work anytime, anywhere.|$|E

Machine learning algorithms, instead, are more robust with respect to dynamic changes of the system. The drawback is that they adopt a black-box approach, ignoring relevant knowledge of the system that could provide valuable insights into its performance.|$|R

Luckily it is extremely unlikely that we will see major ocean circulation changes {{in the next couple of}} decades (I’d be just as surprised as Jack Hall if they did occur); at least most scientists think this will only become a more serious risk towards the end of the century. And the consequences would certainly not be as dramatic as the 'superstorm' depicted in the movie. Nevertheless, a major change in ocean circulation is a risk with serious and partly unpredictable consequences, which we should avoid. And even without events like ocean circulation changes, climate change is serious enough to demand decisive action." ...|$|E
50|$|A social panic is a {{state where}} a social or {{community}} group reacts negatively and in an extreme or irrational manner to unexpected or <b>unforeseen</b> <b>changes</b> in their expected social status quo. According to Folk Devils and Moral Panics by Stanley Cohen, the definition {{can be broken down}} to many different sections. The sections, which were identified by Erich Goode and Nachman Ben-Yehuda in 1994, include concern, hostility, consensus, disproportionality, and volatility. Concern, which is not to be mistaken with fear, is about the possible or potential threat. Hostility occurs when an outrage occurs toward the people who were a part of the problem and agencies who are accountable. These people are seen as the enemy since their behavior is viewed as a danger to society. Consensus includes a distributed agreement that an actual threat is going to take place. This is where the media and other sources come in to aid in spreading of the panic. Disproportionality compares how people react and the actual seriousness of the condition. Volatility is when {{there is no longer any}} more panic.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to guarantee changeability for assembly lines of an automobile manufacturer which involves the usage of the modular design of a mobile platform as basis for a wide-ranging portfolio of automated and partly-automated solutions within the final assembly. Using mobile platforms as basis for assembly units, production can react to a broad variety of foreseen and <b>unforeseen</b> <b>changes</b> (e. g. relocating the assembly unit, switching from cyclical to continuous flow production). The benefits of using these mobile assembly units enable the ability to react easily on various changes. In order to prove the possibility to react on foreseen and <b>unforeseen</b> <b>changes,</b> {{a variation of the}} degree of automation and also a change from cyclical to continuous flow production are demonstrated in a use case about seal-plug assembly with lightweight robots...|$|E

Using seasonal information of stock price over the period 1997 - 2007 as well as regression analysis, the study has determined that risk premium of <b>unforeseen</b> <b>changes</b> in the course structure of interest rates, money supply, inflation rate and unanticipated changes in industrial production are meaningful when the level of significance is five percent.

Therefore, under either customary international law or the Vienna Convention, it is unlikely that a state may unilaterally withdraw from the UN unless some fundamental change has occurred.|$|R
