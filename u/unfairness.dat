5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise categorization or definition, and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics. The implication is that there may be some <b>unfairness</b> where questionable executive action remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, the concept of justiciability is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within the purview of judicial review.|$|E
5|$|In 1776 Bewick {{became a}} partner in Beilby's workshop. The joint {{business}} prospered, becoming Newcastle's leading engraving service with an enviable reputation for high quality work and good service. In September 1776 he went to London for eight months, finding the city rude, deceitful and cruel, and much disliking the <b>unfairness</b> of extreme wealth and poverty side by side. He returned to his beloved Newcastle {{as soon as he}} could, but his time in the capital gave him a wider reputation, business experience, and an awareness of new movements in art.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, a huge {{general strike}} took place {{across the country}} at the {{instigation}} of the Belgian Workers' Party on the issue of voting rights. The system of plural voting, in force since 1893, was extremely unpopular because of its perceived <b>unfairness,</b> but also because the system tended to favor the Catholic Party. Although between 300,000 and 450,000 workers were involved, the strike was ultimately unsuccessful. The party voted in favor ending the strike and taking future action by parliamentary means, on 22 April 1913.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 August the Immigration Department issued 2,180 passes to workers and agents to collect visas and submit {{applications}} to work in Hong Kong, promising to handle all applications submitted. Offices opened one hour earlier than usual, added staff and extended their hours to guarantee that all 2,180 cases would be processed. The Philippine consulate also expected a large workload {{as a result of}} the rehiring provisions. Chinese newspapers published articles calculating how households could maximise their benefits under the waiver rules. Street protests on 3 August decried the waiver's <b>unfairness</b> and its burden on the Immigration Department. According to one protester, the waiver would teach households how to use legal loopholes.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{emphasized}} that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive <b>unfairness.</b> Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive's policy-making powers, {{as it is for}} public authorities, acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it is the job of the courts to determine whether an authority's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|Baron Yamaki (Sessue Hayakawa) is a {{fisherman}} who lives {{along with his}} daughter Toya San (Tsuru Aoki) on an island. The island is inhabited by Buddhists and Yamaki had been cursed by Buddha for an affront {{by one of his}} ancestors who in a murderous rage, defiled an altar of Buddha in the nearby temple. The curse was that if his daughter married anyone, then the nearby volcano would erupt. Toya finds it difficult to form relationships with boys because the village prophet Takeo (Thomas Kurihara) has spread the rumour that she is cursed. She is therefore unwilling to continue her father's acceptance of the curse. When Yamaki takes Toya-san to the Buddha shrine in the garden of his house to pray and try to get the curse removed, she vents her feelings about the god's <b>unfairness.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{key idea}} is that under certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a decision by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to <b>unfairness.</b> The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been <b>unfairness</b> and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can {{come in the form of}} a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds.|$|E
5|$|In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996), the {{appellant}} had appealed {{against his}} wrongful dismissal from employment {{on the grounds}} of procedural <b>unfairness.</b> One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and gainful employment, and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or <b>unfairness.</b> The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E
25|$|Convenience is weighed, using a multi-factored {{test that}} {{includes}} elements such as: {{the connection between}} the plaintiff's claim and the forum, {{the connection between the}} defendant and the forum, <b>unfairness</b> to the defendant by choosing the forum, <b>unfairness</b> to the plaintiff in not choosing the forum, involvement of other parties to the suit (i.e. location of witnesses), and issues of comity such as reciprocity and standard of adjudication.|$|E

25|$|According to Ivor Carryl, a Regional public {{procurement}} notice board {{will be created}} for member states to post their contracts, and where any player feels that <b>unfairness</b> {{is involved in the}} award of the contracts, the CCJ can be called on to adjudicate.|$|E
25|$|People {{who have}} ventromedial frontal cortex lesions {{were found to}} be more likely to reject unfair offers. This was {{suggested}} to be due to the abstractness and delay of the reward, rather than an increased emotional response to the <b>unfairness</b> of the offer.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} insular cortex (AIC) {{is believed}} to be responsible for emotional feelings, including maternal and romantic love, anger, fear, sadness, happiness, sexual arousal, disgust, aversion, <b>unfairness,</b> inequity, indignation, uncertainty, disbelief, social exclusion, trust, empathy, sculptural beauty, a ‘state of union with God’, and hallucinogenic state.|$|E
25|$|In many societies, {{such as the}} USSR, the {{distribution}} lead to anger, as it was felt too equal, unfair. In the current U.S., many feel that {{the distribution}} is unfair in being too unequal. In both cases, the cause is <b>unfairness,</b> not inequality, the researchers conclude.|$|E
25|$|The {{charges of}} <b>unfairness</b> {{led to the}} {{institution}} of a draft lottery for the year 1970 in which a young man's birthday determined his relative risk of being drafted (September 14 was the birthday {{at the top of}} the draft list for 1970; the following year July 9 held this distinction).|$|E

25|$|Korematsu's and Hirabayashi's {{convictions}} were vacated in {{a series}} of coram nobis cases in the early 1980s.

25|$|In Singapore, the Land Acquisition Act (Act) {{for urban}} {{development}} {{during the early}} 1960s, and amended in 1973, affected a great many owners of shophouses and worked a significant compensatory <b>unfairness</b> upon them when their shophouses were seized to satisfy redevelopment efforts. Over the decades, entire blocks of historical shophouses in the urban centre were leveled for high-density developments or governmental facilities.|$|E
25|$|In the letter, Gates {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} most computer hobbyists who were using his company's Altair BASIC software without having paid for it. He asserted that such widespread unauthorized copying in effect discourages developers from investing {{time and money}} in creating high-quality software. He cited the <b>unfairness</b> of gaining the benefits of software authors' time, effort, and capital without paying them.|$|E
25|$|The Health Authority {{was unable}} {{to show that there}} were {{overriding}} public interest considerations which warranted a departure from the promise. The Court also took into account the fact that the Authority had failed to mention any alternative accommodation to be offered to the applicant. Thus, it concluded that the decision to close Mardon House constituted <b>unfairness</b> amounting to an abuse of power.|$|E
25|$|The local Church {{officials}} on Corfu (as {{well as on}} the other Ionian Islands) maintained a deliberate neutrality during the anti-semitic events and did not support the government's efforts to reestablish order, unlike the high echelons of the Church, who took measures to limit the anti-Semitic mood. Similarly the Greek press played a role in publicizing the <b>unfairness</b> of the accusations. The culprits were never prosecuted, however.|$|E
25|$|Robert Charles Mardian (October 23, 1923 – July 17, 2006) was a United States Republican party {{official}} {{who served in}} the administration of Richard Nixon, but was embroiled in the Watergate scandal as one of the Watergate Seven who were indicted by a grand jury for campaign violations. His conviction for conspiracy was overturned because of procedural <b>unfairness</b> and he was not subsequently retried.|$|E
25|$|Perceptions of {{injustice}} and <b>unfairness</b> are significant antecedents and determinants of turnover intention (DeConinck & Stilwell, 2004; Nadiri & Tanova, 2010). In other words, turnover intention {{is a considerable}} outcome of an employee's fairness perceptions. Although all three dimensions of organizational justice {{may play a role}} in an employee’s intention to exit an organization, interactional and distributive justice are more predictive of turnover intention than procedural justice (Thomas & Nagalingappa, 2012).|$|E
25|$|Warner also {{arranged}} for DNA tests of evidence {{left from the}} case of Roger Keith Coleman, who was put to death by the state in 1992. Coleman was convicted in the 1981 rape and stabbing death of his 19-year-old sister-in-law, Wanda McCoy. Coleman drew national attention, even making the cover of Time, by repeatedly claiming innocence and protesting the <b>unfairness</b> of the death penalty. DNA results announced on January 12, 2006 confirmed Coleman's guilt.|$|E
25|$|The {{final round}} {{is for the}} {{individual}} family members within the winning household to draw, no matter their age. Bill's wife Tessie gets the marked slip.

The story ends as Tessie is stoned to death while she bemoans the <b>unfairness</b> of the situation.|$|E
25|$|The {{second reason}} {{has to do}} with precedent. In the 1920s, the Supreme Court upheld the {{constitutionality}} and validity of several land laws. Invalidating the California Alien Land Law would have required overturning these decisions – something that the Court is typically loath to do, especially so shortly after the decision dates. In this case, the Court was able to address the <b>unfairness</b> of the application of the law by focusing on the petitioners’ first contention, and effectively ignore the broader implications.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, {{fans were}} given the {{opportunity}} to vote on the eight starting position players, but in 1957, fans of the Cincinnati Reds stuffed the ballot box (see below), and elected a Red to every position except first base. Commissioner Ford Frick stepped in and removed two Reds from the lineup. As a response to this <b>unfairness,</b> fan voting was discontinued; players, coaches, and managers {{were given the}} sole authority to elect starting position players, for the next dozen years.|$|E
25|$|Chen became {{involved}} in politics in 1980 when he defended the participants of the Kaohsiung Incident in a military court. While his client Huang Hsin-chieh, the leading opposition dissident, and seven co-defendants, including his future Vice President Annette Lu, were found guilty, Chen {{came to be known}} for his forceful and colorful arguments. He has stated that it was during this period that he realized the <b>unfairness</b> of the political system in Taiwan and became politically active {{as a member of the}} Tangwai movement.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 the United States Sentencing Commission {{amended the}} Federal Sentencing Guidelines {{to lessen the}} {{disparity}} between the penalties for the possession and trafficking of powder cocaine and crack cocaine, citing racial disparity and the <b>unfairness</b> of the 100-1 crack-powder penalty threshold ratio. The Commission instead implemented an 18-1 ratio. Michael Mukasey, in the Attorney General's capacity, vehemently opposed and testified against this change, warning that thousands of violent criminals may be released under the guidelines and endanger the community. Mukasey's move was criticized by advocates of elimination of crack-powder disparity.|$|E
25|$|The {{measures}} to expand admissibility of bad character evidence were also opposed {{on the grounds}} of <b>unfairness</b> (the defendant's past bad character can more easily be adduced than a witness's) and of dangerous irrelevance. The measures reforming hearsay, which were more closely modelled on the Law Commission's report than the other reforms, attracted less adverse attention, though the Bar Council disputed some of its aspects. The maximum period a suspected terrorist could be detained without charge was increased from 7 to 14 days. This was later increased to 28 days by the Terrorism Act 2006.|$|E
