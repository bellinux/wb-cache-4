40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} measurements made of {{the duties}} imposed on the brakes of a heavy vehicle when driven over a continental route which included the Susten and other passes in Switzerland and in Austria. On the Susten Pass an investigation was {{made of the}} effect of driving in various gears. The following data were determined for each brake application: vehicle deceleration, rate of energy dis-sipation and total energy dissipated at the brakes, the energy lost by drag losses, the energy absorbed by engine braking, and the temperatures attained in all d r <b>u</b> <b>m</b> <b>s</b> and linings. Measurements were also made of the amount of energy imparted to the vehicle when it was accelerated by the engine between brake applications. Analysis of the results shows that a heavy vehicle travels at a fairly uniform speed down the mountain passes and consequently {{only a small percentage of}} the total energy dissipated is given to the vehicle by the engine in between braking. The work done at the brakes varied between 15 and 62 per cent of the total energy dissipated, the proportion depending on the steepness of the gradient and the driver’s choice of gear for the descent. The maximum amount of work done at the brakes (5. 66 x 107 ft. lb) was on the Susten Pass when the vehicle was driven in third gear. During such a journey the d r <b>u</b> <b>m</b> <b>s</b> attained an average temperature varying between 350400 °C while the linings reached an average temperature in the range 275 - 350 °C. A theoretical analysis is outlined which permits calculation of the temperatures attained at any stage of the descent. This analysis requires a knowledge of the work done in each brake application, together with cooling rates, and gives results in good agreement with the observed temperatures on the Susten Pass. Little difference was observed between the driving behaviour of the two drivers on the various passes; one driver made more brake applications per mile than the other but the duration of each application was less. Consequently, both applied their brakes for approximately tbe same total time and dissipated similar amounts of energy at the brakes when both used the same gear over the same descents...|$|E

40|$|Goat grasses (Aegilops spp.) {{contributed to}} the {{evolution}} of bread wheat and are important sources of genes and alleles for modern wheat improvement. However, their use in alien introgression breeding is hindered by poor knowledge of their genome structure and a lack of molecular tools. The analysis of large and complex genomes may be simplified by dissecting them into single chromosomes via flow cytometric sorting. In some species this is not possible due to similarities in relative DNA content among chromosomes within a karyotype. This work describes the distribution of GAA and ACG microsatellite repeats on chromosomes of the <b>U,</b> <b>M,</b> <b>S</b> and C genomes of Aegilops, and the use of microsatellite probes to label the chromosomes in suspension by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISHIS). Bivariate flow cytometric analysis of chromosome DAPI fluorescence and fluorescence of FITC-labelled microsatellites made it possible to discriminate all chromosomes and sort them with negligible contamination by other chromosomes. DNA of purified chromosomes was used as a template for PCR using COS markers with known positions on wheat A, B and D genomes. Wheat-Aegilops macrosyntenic comparisons using COS markers revealed significant rearrangements in the U and C genomes, while the M and S genomes exhibited structure similar to wheat. Purified chromosome fractions provided an attractive resource to investigate the structure and evolution of the Aegilops genomes, and the COS markers assigned to Aegilops chromosomes will facilitate alien gene introgression into wheat...|$|E

40|$|A simple coupled flux and {{sea state}} model is developed. It is {{applicable}} to low, moderate, and high wind speeds, with a nonarbitrary wave age. It is fully consistent with an atmospheric flux parameterization. The flux model includes {{the influence of}} capillary waves on surface stress, which dominate surface stress on a wave-perturbed surface for <b>U</b> 10, 7 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> 21. The coupled model is verified for conditions of local equilibrium and {{it is used to}} examine the influences of surface tension and capillary waves on the equilibrium sea state at low and moderate wind speeds (<b>U</b> 10, 7 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> 21). Capillary waves can directly influence characteristics of the airflow (roughness length and friction velocity), and surface tension can directly influence wave characteristics (period, phase speed, and wave age). The influences of capillary waves and surface tension on wave characteristics are found to be noticeable for <b>U</b> 10, 6 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> 21, and are likely to be significant in most applications when <b>U</b> 10, 5 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> 21. The conditions under which relations valid for higher wind speeds break down are discussed. The new sea state parameterization is an improvement over previous relations (which apply well for <b>U</b> 10. 7 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> 21) because it is also applicable for low and moderate winds. The mean wind speed over most of the world’s oceans is less than 7 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> 21, so there is considerable need for such a parameterization.

40|$|Background: GAS(Streptococcus pyogenes) is {{a genetically}} diverse human {{pathogen}} having > 150 serotypes. Serotype M 89 strains {{are a common}} cause of GAS pharyngeal and invasive infections. Recent studies indicate M 89 strains may be increasing in prevalence. Over the last 15 years in Italy, two large epidemic outbreaks were caused by macrolide resistant M 89 strains. M 89 epidemic strains differed in gene content encoding virulence factors and macrolide resistance. We used comparative genomics to assess serotype M 89 genetic diversity and its contribution to GAS pathogenesis. Methods:Next-generation DNA sequencing was conducted for 22 isolates (Italy = 5, Canada = 1, New Zealand = 1, U. S. A. = 15). Complete genomes were determined for 1 Italian and 1 U. S. strain. Polymorphisms were identified genome-wide for the cohort and used to infer genetic relationships. Results:The genome of Italian strain 11610 is 1, 709, 407 bp and lacks prophages. Italian epidemic isolates differed pairwise by ~ 32 core-genome SNPs. The genome of U. S. strain MGAS 11027 is 1, 786, 881 bp and has 2 prophages encoding secreted virulence factors. <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>M</b> 89 strains differed pairwise by ~ 397 SNPs. Italian <b>M</b> 89 <b>s</b> differed from <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>M</b> 89 <b>s</b> by ~ 2064 SNPs. SNPs among <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>M</b> 89 <b>s,</b> and differing <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> from Italian <b>M</b> 89 <b>s,</b> were nonrandomly clustered. Conclusions:SNPs among the M 89 strains exceeded that among other GAS serotypes. Most SNPs were attributed to discrete recombination events involving genes encoding virulence factors including surface adhesins, antimicrobial peptides, and secreted anti-immune response proteins. These findings demonstrate that genetic recombination strongly contributes to diversification of M 89 pathogenic capacity...|$|R
