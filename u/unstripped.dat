5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or <b>unstripped,</b> the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E

6000|$|The writer had {{all along}} been {{considering}} of various schemes--providing the men could be kept under command--which might {{be put in}} practice for the general safety, in hopes that the Smeaton {{might be able to}} pick up the boats to leeward, when they were obliged to leave the rock. He was, accordingly, about to address the artificers on the perilous nature of their circumstances, and to propose that all hands should <b>unstrip</b> their upper clothing when the higher parts of the rock were laid under water; that the seamen should remove every unnecessary weight and encumbrance from the boats; that a specified number of men should go into each boat, and that the remainder should hang by the gunwales, while the boats were to be rowed gently towards the Smeaton, as the course to the Pharos, or floating light, lay rather to windward of the rock. But when he attempted to speak his mouth was so parched that his tongue refused utterance, and he now learned by experience that the saliva is as necessary as the tongue itself for speech. He turned to one of the pools on the rock and lapped a little water, which produced immediate relief. But what was his happiness, when on rising from this unpleasant beverage, some one called out, [...] "A boat! a boat!" [...] and, on looking around, at no great distance, a large boat was seen through the haze making towards the rock. This at once enlivened and rejoiced every heart. The timeous visitor proved to be James Spink, the Bell Rock pilot, who had come express from Arbroath with letters. Spink had for some time seen the Smeaton, and had even supposed, from the state of the weather, that all hands were on board of her till he approached more nearly and observed people upon the rock; but not supposing that the assistance of his boat was necessary to carry the artificers off the rock, he anchored on the lee-side and began to fish, waiting, as usual, till the letters were sent for, as the pilot-boat was too large and unwieldy for approaching the rock when there was any roughness or run of the sea at the entrance of the landing creeks.|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{ever there}} was a bridge near Craiganuni in ancient times, it must have been at the Rocks of Brandir. From the days of Wallace to those of General Wade, there were never {{passages}} of this kind but in places of great necessity, too narrow for a boat, and too wide for a leap; even then they were but an unsafe footway formed of the trunks of trees placed transversely from rock to rock, <b>unstripped</b> of their bark, and destitute of either plank or rail. For such a structure there is no place in the neighbourhood of Craiganuni but at the rocks above mentioned. In the lake and on the river the water is far too wide; but at the strait the space is not greater than might be crossed by a tall mountain pine, and the rocks on either side are formed by nature like a pier. That this point was always a place of passage is rendered probable by its facility and the use of recent times. It is not long since it was the common gate of the country on either side the river and the pass: the mode of crossing is yet in the memory of people living, and was performed by a little currach moored on either side the water, and a stout cable fixed across the stream from bank to bank, by which the passengers drew themselves across in the manner still practised in places of the same nature. It is no argument against the existence of a bridge in former times that the above method only existed in ours, rather than a passage of that kind, which would seem the more improved expedient. The contradiction is sufficiently accounted for by the decay of timber in the neighbourhood. Of old, both oaks and firs of an immense size abounded within a very inconsiderable distance; but it is now many years since the destruction of the forests of Glen Eitive and Glen Urcha has deprived the country of all the trees of sufficient size to cross the strait of Brandir; and it is probable that the currach was not introduced till the want of timber had disenabled the inhabitants of the country from maintaining a bridge. It only further remains to be noticed that at some distance below the Rocks of Brandir there was formerly a ford, which was used for cattle in the memory of people living; from the narrowness of the passage, the force of the stream, and the broken bed of the river, it was, however, a dangerous pass, and could only be attempted with safety at leisure and by experience."--NOTES TO THE BRIDAL OF CAOLCHAIRN.|$|E
60|$|Now, the coco-nuts are {{descended from}} a great tribe--the palms and lilies--which have as their main {{distinguishing}} peculiarity the arrangement of parts in their flowers and fruits by threes each. For example, in the most typical flowers of this great group, there are three green outer calyx-pieces, three bright-coloured petals, three long outer stamens, three short inner stamens, three valves to the capsule, and three seeds or three rows of seeds in each fruit. Many palms still keep pretty well to this primitive arrangement, {{but a few of}} them which have specially protected or highly developed fruits or nuts have lost in their later stages the threefold disposition in the fruit, and possess only one seed, often a very large one. There is no better and more typical nut in the whole world than a coco-nut--that is to say, from our present point of view at least, though the fear of that awful person, the botanical Smelfungus, compels me to add that this is not quite technically true. Smelfungus, indeed, would insist upon it that the coco-nut is not a nut at all, and would thrill us with the delightful information, innocently conveyed in that delicious dialect of which he is so great a master, that it is really 'a drupaceous fruit with a fibrous mesocarp.' Still, in spite of Smelfungus with his nice hair-splitting distinctions, it remains true that humanity at large will still call a nut a nut, and that the coco-nut is the highest known development of the peculiar nutty tactics. It has the largest and most richly stored seed of any known plant; and this seed is surrounded by one of the hardest and most unmanageable of any known shells. Hence the coco-nut has readily been able to dispense with the three kernels which each nut used in its earlier and less developed days to produce. But though the palm has thus taken to reducing the number of its seeds in each fruit to the lowest possible point consistent with its continued existence at all, it still goes on retaining many signs of its ancient threefold arrangement. The ancestral and most deeply ingrained habits persist in the earlier stages; {{it is only in the}} mature form that the later acquired habits begin fully to predominate. Even so our own boys pass through an essentially savage childhood of ogres and fairies, bows and arrows, sugar-plums and barbaric nursery tales, as well as a romantic boyhood of mediæval chivalry and adventure, before they steady down into that crowning glory of our race, the solid, sober, matter-of-fact, commercial British Philistine. Hence the coco-nut in its <b>unstripped</b> state is roughly triangular in form, its angles answering to the separate three fruits of simpler palms; and it has three pits or weak places in the shell, through which the embryos of the three original kernels used to force their way out. But as only one of them is now needed, that one alone is left soft; the other two, which would be merely a source of weakness to the plant if unprotected, are covered in the existing nut by harder shell. Doubtless they serve in part to deceive the too inquisitive monkey or other enemy, who probably concludes that if one of the pits is hard and impermeable, the other two are so likewise.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Background: The {{oral route}} still {{remains the most}} popular method for drug {{delivery}} as it is convenient, cost efficient and has high patient compliance. However, for a drug to be successfully administered via this route it {{must be able to}} cross the intestinal membranes with a rate high enough (permeability) in order to enter the blood stream to produce the desired reaction. So, although a new chemical entity may possess pharmacological activity, it may not have the necessary physicochemical properties to be absorbed {{to such an extent that}} it will be of clinical value. For this reason it is necessary to have the means to accurately predict the in vivo permeability of drugs in vitro in a cost efficient manner. Permeability can be predicted by: (i) physicochemical characterisation, (ii) in silico, (iii) in vitro, (iv) in situ or (v) in vivo methods. Of these methods, in vivo studies are the most accurate, however, they have several drawbacks such as being time consuming, have high costs and ethical approval has to be obtained. Physicochemical characterisation and in silico methods are the easiest and cheapest to perform, but lack the physical interactions that occur at the membrane interface, thus lacking in reliability and close correlation with the in vivo situation. In vitro methods using intestinal tissue provides a compromise between the physicochemical characterisation and in vivo testing, as it is easy to perform and mimics the membrane interface found in vivo. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the permeability of selected drugs using rat intestine mounted in Sweetana-Grass diffusion chambers and compare the permeability observed with the absorption of the same drugs in humans using the Fa parameters in order to determine the feasibility of using this in vitro method to predict in vivo permeability. Two different methods of intestinal tissue preparation were also investigated to optimise the method further. Methods: Validations of the various analytical methods used to determine the selected drugs quantitatively were performed. Jejunal tissue was prepared in one of two ways. It was either used as is (<b>unstripped)</b> or the serosal muscle layer was removed (stripped). The transport of caffeine, furosemide, verapamil, ketoprofen, propranolol, carbamazepine, promethazine, paracetamol, acyclovir and ranitidine was determined using a vertical diffusion chamber system, mounted with either stripped or <b>unstripped</b> tissue. All the studies were done in the apical to basolateral direction. Permeability was expressed by the calculation of the apparent permeability co-efficient (Papp). Results: The permeability of all drugs studied was lower than found in previous studies with Caco- 2 cells. This can be expected because of the difference in the composition of the rat intestine and the Caco- 2 cell monolayer as well as the longer path length the drugs have to travel during the absorption process through the jejunal tissue. The data show a non-linear relationship between Fa and Papp. For the stripped method of tissue preparation the r² value obtained was 0. 0579 indicating poor correlation. For the <b>unstripped</b> method of tissue preparation the r² value was 0. 2877, indicating poor but improved correlation compared to the stripped method of tissue preparation. Graphs used to indicate a correlation between Papp and Fa showed aciclovir to be an outlier. Removal of this drug from the equation gave an r² of 0. 4013 for the stripped tissue preparation and 0. 4623 for <b>unstripped</b> tissue preparation indicating a much better correlation between transport across rat intestine and fraction absorbed in humans. Conclusion: It was possible to determine the Papp values for ten selected drugs in this study by using the in vitro Sweetana-Grass diffusion method. These Papp values showed a nonlinear relationship between Fa and Papp in rat jejunum, as has been observed in other studies. When comparing the methods of tissue preparation, the <b>unstripped</b> method of tissue preparation gave a better correlation between Papp and Fa (r² = 0. 0579 compared to r² = 0. 2877). If the outlier aciclovir is excluded, the correlation improves significantly (stripped r² = 0. 4013 <b>unstripped</b> r² = 0. 4623). A possible reason for the high permeability of aciclovir observed in this study may be the fact that its transport is concentration dependant. Also, the absorption of aciclovir varies across species, thus not making it ideal for a study comparing transport across rat intestine to absorption in humans. This method of intestinal transport prediction does show a correlation with fraction absorbed in humans, however a larger number of drugs, with a wider spread of Fa values should be evaluated before it can be used to predict in vivo absorption with confidence.

Freshly prepared skeletons were highly condensed. Incubation at low ionic strength and {{in the presence of}} dithiothreitol for an hour or more caused an expansion of the skeletons, which greatly increased the visibility of their elements. The expansion may reflect the opening of spectrin from a compact to an elongated disposition.

In <b>unstripped</b> preparations, globular masses were observed near the centers of the spectrin filaments, probably corresponding to complexes of ankyrin with band 3 oligomers. Some of these globules linked pairs of spectrin filaments. Skeletons prepared with a minimum of perturbation had thickened actin protofilaments, presumably reflecting the presence of accessory proteins. The length of these actin filaments was highly uniform, averaging 33 +/- 5 nm. This is the length of nonmuscle tropomyosin.

An added magnetic-mirror-field configuration is proposed as {{an effective means of}} minimizing interactions between stripped electrons and the foil. 1. I. N~~~~DUCTI~...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Filamentous skeletons were {{liberated from}} {{isolated}} human erythrocyte membranes in Triton X- 100, spread on fenestrated carbon films, negatively stained, and viewed intact and unfixed in the transmission electron microscope. Two {{forms of the}} skeleton were examined: (a) basic skeletons, stripped of accessory proteins with 1. 5 M NaC 1 so that they contain predominantly polypeptide bands 1, 2, 4. 1, and 5; and (b) <b>unstripped</b> skeletons, which also bore accessory proteins such as ankyrin and band 3 and small plaques of residual lipid. Freshly prepared skeletons were highly condensed. Incubation at low ionic strength and {{in the presence of}} dithiothreitol for an hour or more caused an expansion of the skeletons, which greatly increased the visibility of their elements...|$|E
40|$|Control of beam losses is an {{important}} aspect of the H-injection system for the PS 2, a proposed replacement of the CPS in the CERN injector complex. H- ions may pass the foil <b>unstripped</b> or be partially stripped to excited H 0 states which may be stripped in the subsequent strong-field chicane magnet. Depending on the choice of the magnetic field, atoms in the ground and first excited states can be extracted and dumped. The conceptual design of the waste beam handling is presented, including local collimation and the dump line, both of which must take into account the divergence of the beam from stripping in fringe fields. Beam load estimates and activation related requirements of the local collimators and dump are briefly discussed...|$|E
