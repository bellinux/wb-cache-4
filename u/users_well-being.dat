40|$|Emotional and {{physical}} well-being at workplace {{is important for}} a positive work environment and higher productivity. Jobs such as software programming lead to a sedentary lifestyle and require high interaction with computers. Working at the same job for years can cause a feeling of intellectual stagnation and lack of drive. Many employees experience lack of motivation, mild to extreme depression due to reasons such as aversion towards job responsibilities and incompatibility with coworkers or boss. This research proposed an affect monitoring system EmoFit that would {{play the role of}} psychological {{and physical}} health trainer. The day to day computer activity and body language was analyzed to detect the physical and emotional well-being of the user. Keystrokes, activity interruptions, eye tracking, facial expressions, body posture and speech were monitored to gauge the users health. The system also provided activities such as at-desk exercise and stress relief game and motivational quotes in an attempt to promote <b>users</b> <b>well-being.</b> The experimental results and positive feedback from test subjects showed that EmoFit would help improve emotional and physical well-being at jobs that involve significant computer usage.

40|$|Objective: The study {{aimed to}} explore the {{psychological}} experiences of receiving a kidney transplant from a deceased donor and to examine resulting implications for renal services. Design: A qualitative design was utilised within an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) framework. Main outcome measures: Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} six adults (male = 5, mean age = 45 yrs) on their experiences of receiving a kidney transplant from a deceased donor. All participants had their transplant within the preceding 21 months. Data were analysed using IPA. Results: The four elicited themes incorporate recipients’ positive feelings about receiving a transplant, mainly arising from the newfound freedom that this entails, in addition to strong feelings of gratitude towards their donors. They also capture challenges, such as the uncertainty of living with a transplanted kidney, and highlight the increased dependence on others throughout the transplant process. Conclusion: The findings indicate a range of psychological, social and occupational experiences for participants. It is concluded that optimal care in renal services would incorporate a holistic approach to pre and post-transplant care; identifying and supporting the needs of transplant recipients. A biopsychosocial model of care may enhance service <b>user</b> <b>well-being.</b> Potential areas of future research are explored...|$|R

40|$|<b>User</b> <b>well‐being</b> is {{increasingly}} addressed {{in design and}} design research. Previous work has proposed a design for well-¬‐being framework that includes three main ingredients: pleasure, personal significance, and virtue. While useful for analysing the well-¬‐being impact of existing designs, {{it is difficult to}} use the framework as a resource in well-¬‐being focussed design projects. This paper presents a design case study in which two key challenges have been addressed. The first is to understand how to identify relevant pleasures, personal significances and virtues in the context of design practice. The second is to understand how design concepts can be developed that integrates these three ingredients in a meaningful way. The design case was to develop a car interior for a car sharing service. The first challenge was addressed with two user studies where it was found that especially conflicts or tensions between ingredients stimulated design creativity. The second challenge was addressed by including the factor of time in the design concept (creating a concept in which experiences unfold over time). The design case is presented and the techniques that were used to address the well-¬‐being-¬‐specific design challenges are discussed and reflected on. <br/...|$|R

Newly developed intelligent power wheelchairs (IPWs), allowing autonomous or collaboratively-controlled navigation, could enhance mobility of individuals not able to use, or having difficulty using, standard PWCs. The objective of this study was to explore the perspectives of PWC users (PWUs) and their caregivers regarding if and how IPWs could impact on current challenges faced by PWUs, as well as inform current development of IPWs. A qualitative exploratory study using individual interviews was conducted with PWUs (n = 12) and caregivers (n = 4). A semi-structured interview guide and video were used to facilitate informed discussion regarding IPWs. Thematic analysis revealed three main themes: (1) “challenging situations that may be overcome by an IPW” described how the IPW features of obstacle avoidance, path following, and target following could alleviate PWUs’ identified mobility difficulties; (2) “cautious optimism concerning IPW use revealed participants” addresses concerns regarding using an IPW as well as technological suggestions; (3) “defining the potential IPW user” revealed characteristics of PWUs that would benefit from IPW use.

The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the characteristics of multi-professional team working effectiveness in adult CMHTs to develop a new measure of CMHT effectiveness. The study was conducted between May and November 2010 and comprised two stages. Stage 1 used a formative evaluative approach based on the Productivity Measurement and Enhancement System to develop the scale with multiple stakeholder groups over a series of qualitative workshops held in various locations across England. Stage 2 analysed responses from a cross-sectional survey of 1500 members in 135 CMHTs from 11 Mental Health Trusts in England to determine the scale's psychometric properties. Based on an analysis of its structural validity and reliability, the resultant 20 -item scale demonstrated good psychometric properties and captured one overall latent factor of CMHT effectiveness comprising seven dimensions: improved service <b>user</b> <b>well-being,</b> creative problem-solving, continuous care, inter-team working, respect between professionals, engagement with carers and therapeutic relationships with service users.

40|$|Humans are profoundly {{affected}} by the surroundings which they inhabit. Environmental psychologists have produced numerous credible theories describing optimal human environments, based {{on the concept of}} congruence or “fit” (1, 2). Lack of person/environment fit can lead to stress-related illness and lack of psychosocial well-being (3). Conversely, appropriately designed environments can promote wellness (4) or “salutogenesis” (5). Increasingly, {{research in the area of}} Evidence-Based Design, largely concentrated in the area of healthcare architecture, has tended to bear out these theories (6). Patients and long-term care residents, because of injury, illness or physical/ cognitive impairment, are less likely to be able to intervene to modify their immediate environment, unless this is designed specifically to facilitate their particular needs. In the context of care settings, detailed design of personal space therefore takes on enormous significance. MyRoom conceptualises a personalisable room, utilising sensoring and networked computing to enable the environment to respond directly and continuously to the occupant. Bio-signals collected and relayed to the system will actuate application(s) intended to positively influence <b>user</b> <b>well-being.</b> Drawing on the evidence base in relation to therapeutic design interventions (7), real-time changes in ambient lighting, colour, image, etc. respond continuously to the user’s physiological state, optimising congruence. Based on research evidence, consideration is also given to development of an application which uses natural images (8). It is envisaged that actuation will require machine-learning based on interpretation of data gathered by sensors; sensoring arrangements may vary depending on context and end-user.

Key influences on social exclusion are discussed, with trip making emerging as a significant influence. Trip making is not a significant direct influence on well-being but does exercise an indirect influence through the impact on risk of social exclusion. The modelling process enables a value for additional trips to be estimated, the value being about four times the values derived from conventional generated traffic approaches. Similar high values are found in separate metropolitan and regional case studies, confirming the significance of the results.

The fall detection employs a similar combination of machine learning and domain knowledge. It was tested on five atypical falls and events that can be easily mistaken for a fall. We show in the paper and demo that neither sensor type can correctly recognize all of these events on its own, but the combination of both sensor types yields highly accurate fall detection. In addition, the detection of unusual movement can observe both the user’s micro-movement and macro-movement.

In this paper, {{it is argued that}} by paying more attention to the elaboration of meaning – or symbolic value – designers can develop innovations that are more appealing and relevant to a wider range of potential users, especially by positioning sustainable products, services, and systems as aspirational choices that lead the <b>user</b> to improved <b>well-being</b> and happiness. The theoretical proposition is explored in the context of sustainable Product Service Systems (sustainable PSS), analysing the opportunities they pose for systemic disruption as radical innovations, and proposing a design framework for tackling the cultural barriers for their mainstream adoption. Based on the theoretical propositions, an initial methodological framework for the integration of semiotic and cultural analysis methods to the design process is discussed, in order to better support designers in identify the cultural codes that can make sustainable PSS innovations more relevant and desirable in their socio-cultural context. In exploring the potential of semiotics and cultural analysis methods as a strategy to improve the value proposition of sustainable innovations, we offer a new perspective for understanding the symbolic aspects of consumption as social signifier, and highlight the opportunities this opens for sustainable design to influence societal transformation...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{explosion}} of interest {{in recent years in}} Canada and other countries in macro-indicators and composite indexes of economic and social well-being. This reflects growing recognition of the important role macro-indicators can play as a tool for evaluating trends in and levels of economic and social development and for assessing the impact of policy on well-being. This report provides a literature review of conceptual/operational frameworks for the development of macro-indicators that give an assessment of economic, labour market and social conditions or states of well-being. The report provides an analysis of frameworks for macro-indicators by discussing general framework issues; identifies and describes six specific frameworks for macro-indicators which the author regards as particularly important or relevant, and discusses {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} these sets of indicators/composite indexes; and provides a description of an additional 31 sets of indicators and composite indexes broken down into economic, social, economic/social, and labour market areas. The report concludes that no existing framework currently includes all important concepts and linkages and that it is unlikely that one ever will. As the survey of the macro-indicators literature reveals, the development of a framework for macro-indicators involves choices related to the domains of interest, the purpose for which the indicator is designed, and the population to be covered, among others. Choices or tradeoffs must be made and a balance struck between conceptual sophistication and transparency and between complex linkages that could potentially confuse the <b>user</b> and simplicity. <b>Well-being,</b> Wellbeing, Well Being, Indicators, Indexes, Indices, Methodology, Economic Well-being, Economic, Social, Societal, Labour Market...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomena}} of {{manipulation of the}} economy by the incumbent for electoral purpose are called Political Business Cycles (PBC), introduced by Nordhaus (1975). Using policy control economic instruments, as fiscal and monetary instruments, government may manipulate the economy to gain electoral advantage by producing growth and decreasing unemployment before elections. In addition to increased public expenditures, also the production/supply of certain publicly provided goods may score improvements. In Albania, production and supply of electricity (for the time span of our analyzes) was controlled by KESH (Korporata Energjitike Shqiptare - Albanian Energy Corporation) which is a quasi- monopoly in the supply of electricity in Albania, and it is publicly run. Throughout the transition, supply of electricity, due to various technical and economic reasons, has not been stable, and characterized by systematic interruption for households and businesses <b>users,</b> affecting their <b>well-being</b> and performance (electricity is a main source of energy for households, including heating and cooking). Therefore, it seems {{so that there is}} an incentive and rationale for the incumbent to use also the provision of electricity to impress the voters before elections, beside of the classical instruments of expenditures. In this paper we analyze consumption, production and import of electricity in Albania. Our hypothesis is that before elections, electricity consumption may increase above usual levels, followed by a contraction after elections. In our analysis we use modern standard econometric approach, used widely for research related to PBC.

40|$|This conference {{paper is}} closed access. An {{important}} step towards achieving sustainability {{is to encourage}} a wide uptake of more resource-efficient consumption patterns by the ‘mainstream’ sector of society. At present, one of the barriers for this uptake is that sustainable choices are often perceived as ‘constraining and sacrificing’ (losing out) rather than ‘liberating and beneficial’ (being better off). The initial theory of this research proposes challenging this perception. Design can contribute to encourage more people to adopt sustainable lifestyles by ensuring that the intrinsic values and benefits of sustainable lifestyles are communicated effectively using a culturally relevant discourse. In this paper, we propose a theory and methodology for positioning of sustainable products, services, and systems as culturally aspirational choices that lead the <b>user</b> to improved <b>well-being</b> and happiness. It deals with the cultural perception of sustainable lifestyles and proposes {{the implementation of a}} framework to inform designers on ‘aspirations’ and ‘relevance’ factors at {{the early stages of the}} innovation process. Semiotic and cultural analysis are central to this framework. Their methodologies can be valuable tools to collect data on the aspirations of users and the active cultural codes within a particular context. This data is used by the design team in the early stages of the innovation process to develop sustainable products and services which are more in tune with the user, as they are perceived as culturally relevant, meaningful and thus more desirable choices. Implementing deep rooted and contextualised cultural analysis at the innovation stage of sustainable PSS can contribute greatly not only to enhance their perceived value by making them more desirable, but also to extend their purpose into switching lifestyles from a culture of consumerism to a culture of sustainability...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{widespread}} adoption of wearable sensors {{has led to}} the study of innovative technological solutions to improve <b>user's</b> health and <b>well-being.</b> In this context, a particularly relevant application is the analysis of human walking patterns (gait analysis). Walking {{is one of the most}} common human activities, and thus it can be frequently detected during daily routines. Gait patterns, in turn, provide useful information for a number of applications. For example, wearable-based gait analysis has been proposed as an unobtrusive alternative to clinical assessment in order to early detect health-related conditions that affect motor ability. Indeed, wearable-based gait analysis can be used to continuously monitor the user gait patterns and promptly detect anomalies that may indicate the presence of a health-related condition. Such early detection method, in turn, may be exploited to take appropriate preemptive measures and minimize the risk of adverse health outcomes. Wrist-worn devices, such as smartwatches and smart bands, have brought about the unprecedented opportunity to continuously monitor gait during daily routines. However, the use of a single wrist-worn unit for gait analysis is challenging for a variety of reasons and has been scarcely investigated in the literature. One relevant issue with wrist-worn devices is the reliable detection and extraction of gait segments (i. e., sensor samples containing gait data), which is the essential building block of a gait analysis system. Indeed, the signal collected at the user's wrist is subject to a significant "noise" with respect to other body positions (e. g. waist), mainly due to the arm swing while walking and other unpredictable hand movements. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the design and evaluation of a lightweight and reliable gait detection technique for wrist-worn devices. To this end, the proposed method creates a personalised model of the user's gait patterns. The model is created through an unsupervised training phase, which requires the temporary use of an additional device (smartphone) to properly label the acquired acceleration samples as gait or hand movements. After, anomaly detection is used to distinguish gait from other activities. Gait data from 20 volunteers has been collected to test and evaluate the proposed technique. Volunteers were asked to walk at different pace, with their normal hand swing or placing the hand inside of a pocket. Results show that the proposed method can reliably distinguish gait from hand movements. This will foster the development of trustworthy gait analysis applications based on a wrist-worn device...|$|R
40|$|Facing the {{challenges}} to address complex {{issues associated with}} global environmental change and population ageing in the 21 th century, architecture design in the developed or developing regions and countries all needs {{to play a role}} as a cost-effective tool for sustainable development of our human society rather than a creation only for the sake of art or consumption. This means a substantive ideological change to assess the essential value of architecture according to its long-term impact on people’s health and well-being instead of its metaphysical beauty, and more urgently, calls for some effective and efficient approach for architectural research and practice to integrate all the ethical, aesthetic, environmental, technological and economic considerations into an appropriate architectural model. Beyond an intuitive assumption that the design of built environment affects people’s Health and well-being, and can have long-term implications for the quality of life, this research tends to provide an evidence-based theoretical and methodological orientation to entail architecture with such positive effects, and hence started from a hypothesis that positive emotional effect is the key linkage to correlate aesthetic experience in and of architecture to human subjective well-being (SWB), which is a predominant indicator for measuring general well-being. Accordingly, emotional architecture for everyday life was coined as a special term in this research to represent such an architectural model that functions as a motivation generator for increasing positive human-environment interactions as well as an affective environment for enriching and regulating human emotional state on a basis of daily life. An interdisciplinary framework involving the research fields of environmental aesthetics, positive psychology and emotional design was formulated as theoretical foundation to direct this research. This qualitative research has combined two research strategies of bibliographical review and field study in order to capture the pluralistic qualities of this research in relation to the multiple disciplines of psychology and neuroscience, social science, gerontology, and the professional areas of elderly care and care facility development. Seven research methods including close and extensive reading, access to official documents and statistics, field study notes and photography, semi-structured interviews, participant and non-participant observations have been used for data collection; and narrative, descriptive and interpretative analysis have been respectively employed regarding each research objective. Such a mixed method approach was considered to accumulate diversified research materials and perspectives as much as possible. The theoretical research to identify the general concept and methodological model of emotional architecture for everyday life and the applied research to test its applicability in the specific domain of architecture design for senior living have been conducted and sequentially presented as Part I (Chapter 1 & 2) and Part II (Chapter 3, 4 & 5) in this thesis. In Chapter 1, the related philosophical and psychological theories about the role and functioning mechanism of emotions in influencing people’s perception, motivation and behavior for formulating ethical ideology, aesthetic appreciation, environmental interaction and subjective well-being have been reviewed and taken as evidence to study why and how emotional design approach is possible to comply user experience of a product or environment with <b>user’s</b> long-term <b>well-being.</b> Chapter 2 shows a filtering process to discern the exemplary qualities and design mechanism of emotional architecture for everyday life from the previous architectural design theories and practices by synthesizing the multidisciplinary knowledgereviewed in Chapter 1. Chapter 3 interprets the main influential factors that affirm or oppress design quality and efficacy of senior living architecture in a global context. Chapter 4 explores the essential spatial implications responsive to elderly’s psychological needs for everyday life through a series of field studies in a selected public care facility in Barcelona. Chapter 5 presents case studies on four selected architectural projects for senior living in order to generalize the applicable design methods for positive emotional effects. An inherent difference in aspect of the cognitive process for aesthetic appreciation has been found among artists, design professionals and non-professional users/appreciators, which implies an empathetic thinking with the users and/or occupants of architecture is necessary for architectural designers to filter the effective emotional stimuli and design approach for positive emotional effects in the design process. A general distance between the actual efficacy of senior living architecture and its socio-political target of promoting social and individual well-being has been detected to emerge because that (1) an inherited mind-set of relying on social manifestation and engineering measures has resulted in a bureaucratic formula of architecture design to apply the standardized configurations and technologies; and /or, (2) aesthetic design associated with traditional formal and stylistic aesthetics of architecture does not respond to a user-centered design thinking and evidence-based design methodology at psychological level. With regard to achieving the substantive quality of senior living architecture in an aged society as being perceived as safe, healthy, appealing and healing environment for all ages, technical design measures for compensating physical/mental frailty and disabilities need be fused into a humane backdrop rather than being highlighted as indifferent devices. Hence, a methodological model for designing emotional architecture for everyday life and a working model of emotional architecture design for senior living have been established and associated as a practical approach to enhance reciprocal improvement of architectural research and practice with an inclusive vision of human health and well-being. The overarching conclusion of this research has been that strong potential of architecture design to comply with the socio-political paradigm for general welfare goal lies in an integration of reality-based and future-oriented aesthetic philosophy of everyday life, scientific understanding of multidisciplinary knowledge on human factors, and the application of emotional design approach to adapt various targeted users, and existing cultural/natural context and economic/technical conditions...|$|R
