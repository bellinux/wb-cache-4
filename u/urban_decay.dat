Some inner-city areas are noted for chronic <b>urban</b> <b>decay.</b> Salford's housing stock is characterised by an oversupply of older, smaller terraced housing and flatted accommodation that declined in value during the late 20th century. As demand fell, it left many owners in negative equity and often without the means to maintain their homes in reasonable condition. As a result, much of the {{built environment}} is poor.|$|E

The uncertainty of development has caused <b>urban</b> <b>decay</b> and property blight along its route, and led to criticism over its poor pollution record. Several London Borough Councils have set up regeneration projects to improve the environment for communities surrounding the North Circular.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{the cities of}} New Jersey began {{experiencing}} <b>urban</b> <b>decay.</b> Governments attempted to intervene with the <b>urban</b> <b>decay,</b> focusing on the office Gateway Center and several other projects.

Around the 1970s, urbanization started increasing again.|$|E

40|$|This book {{explores the}} role of {{technology}} in ecological urban design and regeneration. Part I provides theoretical and methodological insights into technological approaches that offer optimum respect to existing cultural and natural environments, while offering minimum impact and carbon footprint.

The case studies offer insights from the Mediterranean and the Middle East in a diverse range of spaces, from central urban squares, oblique cities, <b>urban</b> waterfronts, <b>decaying</b> suburbs, to peri-urban areas such as touristic waterfronts, former industrial areas, hyper-commercial areas, humid zones and parks...|$|R

25|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>decay</b> is {{the sociological}} process whereby a city, {{or part of}} a city, falls into {{disrepair}} and decrepitude. Its characteristics are depopulation, economic restructuring, abandoned buildings, high local unemployment (and thus poverty), fragmented families, political disenfranchisement, crime, and a desolate, inhospitable city landscape. White flight contributed to the draining of cities' tax bases when middle-class people left. Abandoned properties attracted criminals and street gangs, contributing to crime.|$|E
25|$|The largely {{industrial}} economy of Massachusetts began to falter, however, {{due to the}} dependence of factory communities upon the production {{of one or two}} goods.
