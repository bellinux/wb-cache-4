25|$|In <b>Unscramble</b> this Picture Puzzle, a 3 by 3 or a 4 by 4 sliding puzzle {{is shown}} on the screens, later it became a 5 by 5 sliding puzzle. The puzzle can be a person, a place or an object. When a team buzzes in, the puzzle freezes. The first team to {{identify}} the puzzle gets 10 points for their team and the puzzle is instantly revealed to the audience. If they get it wrong, no points are deducted but they get locked out allowing the other teams to answer it. If all three teams fail to identify the puzzle (scrambled or not), no points are given out {{and the answer is}} revealed.|$|E
25|$|Internet {{security}} experts {{said that the}} passwords were easy to <b>unscramble</b> because of LinkedIn's failure to use a salt when hashing them, which is considered an insecure practice because it allows attackers to quickly reverse the scrambling process using existing standard rainbow tables, pre-made lists of matching scrambled and unscrambled passwords. Another issue that sparked controversy was the iOS app provided by LinkedIn, which grabs personal names, emails, and notes from a mobile calendar without the user's approval. Security experts working for Skycure Security said that the application collects a user's personal data and sends it to the LinkedIn server. LinkedIn claimed the permission for this feature is user-granted, and the information is sent securely using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. The company added that it had never stored or shared that information with a third party.|$|E
25|$|By 1987, nine {{channels}} were scrambled, but 99 {{others were}} available free-to-air. While HBO initially charged a monthly fee of $19.95, soon it became possible to <b>unscramble</b> all channels for $200 a year. Dish sales went down from 600,000 in 1985 to 350,000 in 1986, but pay television services were seeing dishes as something positive since {{some people would}} never have cable service, and the industry was starting to recover as a result. Scrambling also {{led to the development}} of pay-per-view events. On November 1, 1988, NBC began scrambling its C-band signal but left its Ku band signal unencrypted in order for affiliates to not lose viewers who could not see their advertising. Most of the two million satellite dish users in the United States still used C-band. ABC and CBS were considering scrambling, though CBS was reluctant due to the number of people unable to receive local network affiliates. The piracy on satellite television networks in the US led to the introduction of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. This legislation enabled anyone caught engaging in signal theft to be fined up to $50,000 and to be sentenced to a maximum of two years in prison. A repeat offender can be fined up to $100,000 and be imprisoned for up to five years.|$|E

500|$|The paper {{distinguished}} {{itself in}} {{the coverage of the}} Korean War; Bigart and Marguerite Higgins, who engaged in a fierce rivalry, shared a Pulitzer Prize with Chicago Daily News correspondent Keyes Beech and three other reporters in 1951. [...] The Tribunes cultural criticism was also prominent: John Crosby's radio and television column was syndicated in 29 newspapers by 1949, and Walter Kerr began a successful three-decade career as a Broadway reviewer at the Tribune in 1951. [...] Its Paris edition, still profitable after the war, published the first columns by Art Buchwald. However, the paper's losses were continuing to mount. [...] Whitelaw Reid was gradually replaced by his brother, Ogden R. Reid, nicknamed [...] "Brown", to take charge of the paper. [...] As president and publisher of the paper, Brown Reid tried to interject an energy his brother lacked and reach out to new audiences. [...] In that spirit, the Tribune ran a promotion called [...] "Tangle Towns", where readers were invited to <b>unscramble</b> the names of jumbled up town and city names in exchange for prizes. [...] Reid also gave more prominent play to crime and entertainment stories. [...] Much of the staff, including Whitelaw Reid, felt there was too much focus on circulation {{at the expense of the}} paper's editorial standards, but the promotions initially worked, boosting its weekday circulation to over 400,000.|$|E

In 2005, <b>Unscrambled</b> Eggs received the Poetry Book of Merit Award from The American Authors Association.|$|R
40|$|Participants {{provided}} {{information about their}} childhood by rating the confidence that they had experienced various events (e. g., 'broke a window playing ball'). On some trials, participants <b>unscrambled</b> a key word from the event-phrase (e. g., wdinwo – window) or an unrelated word (e. g., gnutge – nugget) before seeing the event and giving their confidence rating. <b>Unscrambling</b> led participants to increase their confidence that the event occurred in their childhood, but only when the confidence rating immediately followed the act of <b>unscrambling.</b> This increase in confidence mirrors the “revelation effect” observed in word recognition experiments. We analyze our data using a new signal detection mixture distribution model which does not require that the researcher knows the veracity of memory judgments a priori. Our analysis reveals that <b>unscrambling</b> a key word or an unrelated word affects response bias and discriminability in autobiographical memory tests {{in ways that are}} very similar to those that have been previously found for word recognition tasks. ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{team who}} answers the <b>Unscramble</b> this Picture Puzzle {{question}} on the buzzer {{has the right to}} choose one of three topics for Fact or Fiction, a new round in 2006 and get five seconds to make that decision.

These questions are simply true or false questions, however in this round for some reason they are labeled fact or fiction instead, and answering with [...] "true" [...] or [...] "false" [...] is accepted.|$|E
2500|$|Within the {{structure}} of the program, there were two enduring elements. The first was the [...] "Soul Train Scramble Board", where two dancers are given 60 seconds to <b>unscramble</b> a set of letters that form the name of that show's performer or a notable person in African American history. In describing the person's renown, the host concluded their description with the phrase [...] "...whose name you should know". Cornelius openly admitted after the series ended its run that the game was usually set up so everybody won in an effort not to cause embarrassment for the show or African Americans in general.|$|E
2500|$|White {{had become}} a {{powerful}} figure: segregationist senator James F Byrnes of South Carolina said in session about the Dyer bill, [...] "One Negro has ordered this bill to pass. If Walter White should consent to have this bill laid aside its advocates would desert it as quickly as football players <b>unscramble</b> when the whistle of the referee is heard." [...] White's word {{was the only thing}} that kept the bill before Congress. Although the bill did not pass the Senate, White and the NAACP secured widespread public support for the cause. By 1938, a Gallup poll found that 72% of Americans and 57% of Southerners favored an anti-lynching bill. White also contributed to creating alliances among civil rights activists, many of whom went on to lead in the movement from the 1950s.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century more complex {{classification}} systems were developed to allow governments to manage their information according {{to the degree of}} sensitivity. The British Government codified this, to some extent, with the publication of the Official Secrets Act in 1889. By the time of the First World War, multi-tier classification systems were used to communicate information to and from various fronts, which encouraged greater use of code making and breaking sections in diplomatic and military headquarters. In the United Kingdom this {{led to the creation of}} the Government Code and Cypher School in 1919. Encoding became more sophisticated between the wars as machines were employed to scramble and <b>unscramble</b> information. The volume of information shared by the Allied countries during the Second World War necessitated formal alignment of classification systems and procedural controls. An arcane range of markings evolved to indicate who could handle documents (usually officers rather than men) and where they should be stored as increasingly complex safes and storage facilities were developed.The Enigma Machine which was employed by the Germans to encrypt the data of warfare and successfully decrypted by Alan Turing [...] can be regarded as a striking example of creating and using secured information. Procedures evolved to ensure documents were destroyed properly and it was the failure to follow these procedures which led to some of the greatest intelligence coups of the war (e.g. U-570).|$|E
2500|$|An American {{version of}} Countdown was tapped in 1990 as an unsold pilot. Hosted by British expat Michael Jackson (a Los Angeles-based radio personality, and {{announced}} by game show veteran Charlie O'Donnell, this version followed {{closely to the}} British version, with a few changes. Civilian contestants were paired up with celebrities and played two games each. Three rounds were played in each game, with a bonus round to the higher scoring team. The first two rounds, like the British version, had each contestant taking turns picking nine letter tiles and attempting to form one word in 30 seconds. Like the British version, the team that formed the longest word was awarded the points based on how many letters were used. Teams were allowed to confer {{with each other in}} the first two rounds. The third round, only eight-letter titles were picked, with the ninth being a [...] "wild card" [...] that the contestant could use anyway they would like. In this round, the contestant is not allowed to confer with their celebrity partner. The player with the highest score after three rounds wins the game and plays the bonus round. Any player that forms a word using all nine letters wins a progressive jackpot (on the pilot episode, that was $25,000). In the bonus round, the contestant works with their celebrity partner to <b>unscramble</b> six words in 45 seconds. Each word gets longer, starting with a four-letter word, then a five-letter word, then a six-letter word, then a seven-letter word, then an eight-letter word, and finally a nine-letter word. The contestant would earn $200 for every unscrambled word, with a prize of $10,000 for unscrambling all six words. Contestants would switch celebrity partners and play another game in the same format (three rounds, with another chance at the bonus round). The contestant with the higher total score at the end of both games would return to the next show. If the contestants tied, both would return to the next show. Five-day champions would win a new car and retire undefeated. The Numbers round and the Conundrum round were both eliminated from the American version.|$|E

It was her hope that the quiet life and {{soothing}} air of Brookport, with--unless you counted the money-in-the-slot musical box at the store--its absence of the fiercer excitements, might in time pull him together and <b>unscramble</b> his disordered nervous system. She liked to listen of a morning to the sound of Nutty busy in the next room with a broom and a dustpan, for in the simple lexicon of Flack's there was no such word as 'help'. The privy purse would not run to a maid. Elizabeth did the cooking and Claude Nutcombe the housework.|$|E
