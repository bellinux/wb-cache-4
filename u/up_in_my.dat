25|$|Ray Illingworth's England side in 1970-71 were mentally {{the toughest}} English side I played against, and the {{experience}} of playing against them first <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> Test career reinforced what I had learnt in the backyard. Test cricket was not for the faint of heart. Illingworth subjected us to a mental intimidation by aggressive field placings, and physical intimidation by constant use of his pace attack, ably led by one of the best fast bowlers of my experience, John Snow. Winning to Illingworth was something he expected of himself and demanded of his team.|$|E

Churchill was impressed by Bevin's opposition to trade-union pacifism and his appetite for work (according to Churchill, Bevin was by 'far the most distinguished man that the Labour Party have thrown <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time'), and appointed Bevin {{to the position of}} Minister for Labour and National Service. As Bevin was not actually an MP at the time, to remove the resulting constitutional anomaly, a parliamentary position was hurriedly found for him and Bevin was elected unopposed to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for the London constituency of Wandsworth Central.|$|E

500|$|Ferb {{also seems}} to possess good insight, which is {{probably}} the main character trait, other than his silence, distinguishing his character from Phineas. Jean Yoo, an official press member for Disney Channel, notes that when Ferb does speak, [...] "it always shows {{a greater understanding of}} the situation than his countenance would indicate." [...] Ferb {{also seems to}} prefer singing to talking. He usually says one sentence per episode, such as [...] "Platypuses are the only mammals to lay eggs," [...] "Well, he [...] was all <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> face," [...] or [...] "Candace, we [...] are just kids." [...] He also has a crush on Vanessa Doofenshmirtz.|$|E
500|$|After the song's release, critics heavily {{compared}} its {{lyrics to}} Eminem, and suggested Carey alluded {{to him and}} his 'obsession' with her. [...] "Obsessed" [...] never mentions the rapper's name, although reviewers felt it to be very obvious. The song begins with [...] "I was like, 'Why are you so obsessed with me?'", before the music begins. This line references the 2004 film Mean Girls. As the first verse begins, Carey describes the tracks' subjects constant lies: [...] "All up in the blogs sayin' we met at a bar / When I don't even, know who you are / Sayin' you <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> house sayin' you <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> car / When you in L.A. and I'm at Jermaine's". Additionally, the song suggests the stalker is under the influence of drugs: It must be the weed, it must be the E / 'Cause you be poppin', heard you get it poppin'." [...] During the chorus, Carey confronts her stalker, asking: Why are you so obsessed with me / Boy I wanna know / Lying that you're sexing me / When everybody knows/ It's clear that you're upset with me / Oh, Oh, Oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress / last man on the earth still couldn't get this." [...] During the song's second verse, critics complimented Carey's lyrics, highlighting phrases such as: You're a mom & pop, I'm a corporation / I'm the press conference, you're a conversation", [...] "suggesting the rapper isn't a worthy suitor".|$|E
500|$|... "Dress You Up" [...] {{was also}} {{the subject of much}} media attention, when it was {{included}} on the Parents Music Resource Center's (PMRC) [...] "Filthy Fifteen" [...] list, for the perceived sexual content of its lyrics. The Center's founder Tipper Gore had heard her daughter listening to the song, and considered the line [...] "Gonna dress you <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> love" [...] as exemplifying [...] "vulgar music". The PMRC called upon the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to give parents a consumer-friendly means of identifying rock records unsuitable for minors—a rating system based on lyrical content.

[...] The audience who was watching cleans up the mess (due to Doofenshmirtz's machine accidentally telling them to). At the parking lot a few minutes later, Phineas thanks Holyfield for his help and Holyfield walks off. Ferb makes a comment which accidentally offends Buford and {{he is about to}} be beaten up, but he knocks Buford out with a Vulcan nerve pinch, to Phineas's surprise.

500|$|Yeah, I {{really felt}} {{at that point}} she was pretty strung out. Her whole world was rocked. She never thought she could get {{pregnant}} {{and then all of}} a sudden she's carrying this child and she's experiencing this soul for the first time in four hundred years. [...] the realisation that as soon as the baby's born the soul's going to go away, and it's the first time she really experienced true love, so she was going through a lot emotionally. I just didn't think that she would have time to really think about how she looked. I don't think it was a priority, and so for me as an actor it was important that I reveal that.

500|$|Miyazaki based {{some of the}} {{buildings}} in the spirit world on {{the buildings}} in the real-life Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. He often visited the museum for inspiration while working on the film. Miyazaki had {{always been interested in}} the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the Meiji period that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, [...] "especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, and the sun is setting– tears well <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> eyes." [...] Another major inspiration was the Notoyaryokan, a traditional Japanese inn located in Yamagata Prefecture, famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features. While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of Jiufen in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film, Miyazaki has denied this. The Dōgo Onsen is also often said to be a key inspiration for the Spirited Away onsen/bathhouse.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly included the episode's ending in their list of television's best cliffhangers of 2011, and later named it the sixteenth best episode of the series.

Wells {{wanted to talk to}} the real-life survivor of her role, Katie Starks, but Katie refused. The Town That Dreaded Sundown was Wells' fourth film and her second time working with Pierce. During her stay, she did not read the script; she relied on the director, instead. She said that was the way she wanted it. Wells explained, [...] "Acting-wise, it's an extremely emotional role. I didn't want to pattern my interpretation after anything. I wanted to go on my own feelings." [...] Being shot was a new experience for the actress.

500|$|The {{character}} of Loretta was {{created as a}} temporary love interest for Dominic Reilly (John Pickard) and was intended to feature only in Hollyoaks Later, the spin-off from the Hollyoaks series. In 2009 {{it was announced that}} the Hollyoaks producer Lucy Allan had decided to introduce both Loretta and Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) into the main show. Allan said, [...] "Cheryl and Loretta will bring an energy and a sense of fun to the show. Both Melissa and Bronagh impressed me with their performances in Hollyoaks Later and I'm sure viewers will warm to them quickly." [...] Loretta was initially paired with Dom and, after ending their relationship, was given links to other characters in the series. To prepare for the role Walton took pole-dancing classes and visited a lap dancing club. After watching girls perform at the club she carried out routines in her underwear. She also had a pole set up in her living room to carry on practicing. Speaking of her research Walton stated: [...] "I loved it. It's really good exercise. It's really good for toning. They didn't ask me to, but I did... I went and I had pole dancing classes. I had a pole put <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> living room." ...|$|E
500|$|Recorded at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California by Josh Mosser, [...] "Circles" [...] {{was written}} by Christina Aguilera, Candice Pillay, Alexander Grant and Dwayne Abernathy, and it was {{produced}} by Alex da Kid. Aguilera's vocals were recorded by Oscar Ramirez at The Red Lips Room in Beverly Hills, California, while Aguilera and Pillay conducted the vocal production. Pillay also contributed additional vocals on the track, and J Browz added additional guitar. [...] "Circles" [...] is an alternative rock song, and runs for a duration of [...] (three minutes and twenty-five seconds). The lyrics of the [...] "rawky" [...] chorus, [...] "spin around in circles on my middle middle finger", has been likened to a [...] "'90s riot-grrrl". Andrew Hampp for Billboard thought as though it sounded like [...] "mini-Aguilera's" [...] were chanting the words [...] "round and round" [...] and [...] "motherfucker" [...] in childlike voices. [...] "Circles" [...] has a [...] "playground" [...] melodic structure, according to Robert Copsey of Digital Spy. He also thought the best lyrics in the song are [...] "Why you always trying to get <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mixture?/ I think you're just bitter".

500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using {{a lot more of}} my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> basement, so I just try to finish songs and {{get them out of the}} way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas. We just sift through that stuff, as well as the stuff we do in rehearsal and just pick the best ideas and go.

500|$|Hill began {{recording}} The Miseducation in late 1997 at Chung King Studios in New York City, {{and completed}} it in June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. In an interview, Hill described {{the first day}} of recording, stating: [...] "The first day in the studio I ordered every instrument I ever fell in love with: harps, strings, timpani drums, organs, clarinets. It was my idea to record it so the human element stayed in. I didn't want it to be too technically perfect." [...] Initially, Jean did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered to help as a producer, which she did not accept. Aside from doing work at Chung King Studios, Hill also recorded at Perfect Pair Studios in New Jersey, as well as Sony Studios, with some songs having different elements recorded at different studios. The bulk of the album, however, was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, the studio built by reggae musician Bob Marley. Regarding this shift in environment, Hill stated: [...] "When I started recording in New York and New Jersey, lots of people were talking to me about going different routes. I could feel people <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> face, and I was picking up on bad vibes. I wanted a place where there was good vibes, where I was among family, and it was Tuff Gong." [...] Many members of the Marley family were present in the studio during the recording sessions, among them Julian Marley, who added guitar elements to [...] "Forgive Them Father." ...|$|E
500|$|Houston {{performed}} [...] "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" [...] live {{a number}} of times, between 1996 and 2009. In February 1997, Houston performed it as the third song of her 'Waiting to Exhale Medley'―"Sittin' <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Room" [...] by Brandy, [...] "Not Gon' Cry" [...] by Mary J. Blige, [...] "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" [...] by Houston, and [...] "Count On Me" [...] by Houston, CeCe Winans, Brandy, Blige, Chaka Khan, and Aretha Franklin―at the 39th Grammy Awards. Houston sang the song live on the HBO special [...] "Classic Whitney Live from Washington, D.C." [...] on both October 3 and 5, 1997. Houston's solo performance was followed by ad-libs of its chorus. She was joined by [...] BeBe Winans, Monica, and Shirley Caesar, who was seated in the audience and invited onstage by Houston. Houston used the song throughout the entire run of her The Pacific Rim Tour (1997). She performed it again during the entire run of her My Love Is Your Love World Tour (1999), {{as a part of}} the promotion for her fourth studio album, My Love Is Your Love (1998). In April 2000, Houston performed the song on the 25th Anniversary Celebration of Arista Records. She was backed by a seven-piece band, a 14-piece string section and four background singers. Houston started by saying [...] "We all need to exhale sometimes", and proceeded to sing the song. The song was included in the set list of her Nothing but Love World Tour (2010) promoting her seventh studio album, I Look to You (2009).|$|E
500|$|As {{noted by}} {{interviewer}} Kurt Wolff, [...] "the melody and overall {{sound of the}} song also stand out as something fresh and very different." [...] Tompkins explained to Wolff that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was an [...] "attempt at 'melodic pop' that was 'unique' yet still 'country.'" [...] Tompkins also commented that [...] "Blown Away" [...] is [...] "not even mine and Josh’s song anymore; it's [...] song now. She's completely claimed it. The song is Carrie. It's not even a song that had a chance of being pitched to anybody else. It's a completely different type of song for Carrie. She's {{got a lot of}} pop elements, and I listen to a lot of pop, but I listen to everything from Randy Newman to Mozart to Rihanna to Steely Dan. I think all that stuff shows <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> music, and I think it showed up in 'Blown Away.'" [...] The final version of the song was produced by Mark Bright, who drew inspiration from 1980s music. Underwood recalled Bright adding an effect to her vocals similar to the ones used in Def Leppard songs: [...] "That was a big thing with , all of that hollow vocal sound. And I liked it." [...] Bright used a similar effect on [...] "See You Again", another song from Blown Away. Melodically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] is written in the key of A minor, and is set in the common time with a tempo of 134 beats per minute. The song follows the sequence of Am - C - G as its chord progression, and Underwood's voice spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of E5.|$|E
