5|$|The {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek {{is continuing}} to become more developed, but at a slower rate than {{it has in the}} past. The lower reaches of the watershed are the most heavily urbanized, while the <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> are still largely rural. This has been the case as early 1893. The <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> of the watershed have a dendritic drainage system.|$|E

5|$|Hull Creek is a second-order stream. Its {{watershed}} {{is relatively}} narrow. In the <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> of the creek's watershed, residential areas are sparse {{and tend to}} be somewhat removed from the creek itself. In Blakely, it follows Pennsylvania Route 347 closely and crosses it several times. A gas line crosses the creek upstream of US Route 6. There are several patches of wetlands in the watershed's <b>upper</b> <b>reaches,</b> and two more {{in the middle and}} lower reaches. Upstream of Blakely, the watershed contains forested land and pastures on a rolling plateau.|$|E

5|$|The Shinano River system, {{particularly}} in its <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> (Chikuma River) {{and in the}} Sai basin, is used for hydroelectric power generation due to the steep gradient in its <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> and its high discharge producing, as a whole, 2,618 megawatts. While the construction of hydroelectric power stations began before World War II, it significantly increased following the war. These power plants, such as the Shimofanato Power Station and the 450,000 kilowatt JR East Shinano River Hydropower Station near Ojiya, supply Tokyo.|$|E

5|$|Although heavily polluted, {{the creek}} {{supports}} aquatic life, including coastal cutthroat trout (leopard spotted) in its <b>upper</b> <b>reaches.</b> Watershed councils {{such as the}} Fans of Fanno Creek and government agencies have worked to limit pollution and to restore native vegetation in riparian zones.|$|E
5|$|Although {{much of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> are now {{designated}} as leisure routes, there is still significant commercial traffic on the navigation. 300,000 tons were carried in 2007, {{although most of the}} traffic is now petroleum and gravel, rather than the coal which kept the navigation profitable for 150 years.|$|E
5|$|Eddy Creek has no named tributaries. However, a 1916 book {{stated that}} several small streams {{discharged}} into the creek in its <b>upper</b> <b>reaches.</b> At the time, these streams had clear water, but were {{dry in the}} summer.|$|E

50|$|The Schwinge is a 27.8 km, {{left-sided}} {{river of}} the Elbe in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is {{rising in the}} Hohes Moor near Mulsum on the Stade Geest in the bifurcation area with the Oste. From there it flows in a largely natural, more than 20 km <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> towards Stade. Because of its very natural river scenery and its biodiversity the floodplains of the <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> and the meadows near Stade are protected for landscape conservation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> of {{the lower}} {{watershed}} of San Mateo Creek below Crystal Springs Dam consists of open space and sparsely developed residential areas of the cities of Hillsborough and San Mateo, California.This <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> consists of closed canopy California oak woodland and serpentine grassland. The creek roughly parallels Crystal Springs Road through this section. Due to the unusual microclimate and presence of abundant serpentine there are an unusual number of rare plants in the upper catchment basin.|$|R
5|$|In August 2002, the Pennsylvania Environmental Council {{received}} $57,897.76 {{to carry}} out a restoration plan on the <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> of Little Wapwallopen Creek. Since 2005, a project to remedy streambank erosion on the creek has been successful. The creek has a watershed association known as the Little Wapwallopen Creek Watershed Association.|$|E
5|$|In the 1800s, {{settlement}} of the <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> of the Kettle Creek watershed centered on Germania, while the {{settlement of}} the lower reaches centered on the community of Leidy. A community near Trout Run began to attract people in the 1870s and 1880s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011, {{the average number of}} fecal {{coliform}} colonies per 100 milliliters of water in the <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> of Buffalo Creek ranged from 291 to over 600.

40|$|Heihe River Basin is {{the second}} largest inland river basin in China, where water supply service in the <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> has greater {{influence}} on the sustainable development of middle and lower reaches. This study analyzed the influence of land use/land cover change (LUCC) on the water supply service in the <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> by carrying out scenario simulation. Firstly, we analyzed the LUCC and climate change in the <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> during 1990 - 2005; then the water supply service, which was represented by the annual water yield, was estimated with the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. Thereafter three scenarios (precipitation change and LUCC change combined, LUCC change only, and precipitation change only) were established to analyze the impacts of LUCC and precipitation change on the water yield. The {{results show that the}} LUCC exerted great influence on water yield, while the impact of precipitation change is even more significant than that of LUCC. Although there are still some uncertainties, {{the results of this study}} can still provide valuable reference information for ecological conservation and water resource management in the <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> of the Heihe River Basin...|$|R
