A brief description of the different types of simulators is presented and their respective properties are outlined and compared in relation to model-based fault detection.

For the three-body systems, BH {{was found to be}} perturbative for certain choices of the harmonic oscillator (HO) parameter b. We extend upon this work by applying this formalism to the alpha particle and certain five-, six-, and seven-body nuclei in the p-shell. Furthermore, we use only the leading order BH term and work in the smallest allowed included-spaces for each few-body system (0 hw and 2 hw). We show how to calculate A-body matrix elements within this formalism. Stationary solutions are found for all nuclei investigated within this work. The calculated binding energy of the alpha particle differs by ~ 1 MeV from Faddeev-Yakubovsky calculations. However, calculated energies of p-shell nuclei are <b>underbound,</b> leaving p-shell nuclei that are susceptible to cluster breakup.

40|$|Consistent {{description}} of 12 C and 16 O {{has been a}} long standing problem of microscopic alpha cluster models, where the wave function is fully antisymmetrized and the effective interaction is applied not between alpha clusters but between nucleons. When the effective interaction is designed to reproduce the binding energy of 16 O (four alpha), the binding energy of 12 C (three alpha) becomes <b>underbound</b> by about 10 MeV. In the present study, by taking into account the coupling with the jj-coupling shell model components and utilizing Tohsaki interaction, which is phenomenological but has finite-range three-body interaction terms, we show that consistent understanding of these nuclei can be achieved. The original Tohsaki interaction gives small overbound of about 3 MeV for 16 O, and this is improved by slightly modifying three-body Majorana exchange parameter. Also, the coupling with the jj-coupling shell model wave function strongly contributes to the increase of the binding energy of 12 C. So far the application of Tohsaki interaction has been limited to 4 N nuclei, and here, we add Bartlet and Heisenberg exchange terms in the two-body interaction for the purpose of applying it to neutron-rich systems, and it is applied to 6 He...|$|E

40|$|A {{microscopic}} {{description of}} nuclei {{is important to}} understand the nuclear shell-model from fundamental principles. This is difficult to achieve for more than the lightest nuclei without an effective approximation scheme. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to define and evaluate an approximation scheme that can be used to study nuclei that are described as two particles attached to a closed (sub-) shell nucleus. The equation-of-motion coupled-cluster formalism has been used to obtain ground and excited state energies. This method is based on the diagonalization of a non-Hermitian matrix obtained from a similarity transformation of the many-body nuclear Hamiltonian. A chiral interaction at the next-to-next-to-next-to leading order using a cutoff at 500 MeV was used. The ground state energies of ^ 6 Li and ^ 6 He were in good agreement with a no-core shell-model calculation using the same interaction. Several excited states were also produced with overall good agreement. Only the J^π= 3 ^+ excited state in ^ 6 Li showed a sizable deviation.

Moreover, the calculated spectra were converged and comparable to both experiment and shell-model studies in this region. Some excited states in ^ 18 O were high or missing in the spectrum.

Spurious center-of-mass excitations are clearly identified. Comment: 23 pages, 17 figures. Accepted for publication in PR...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{literature}} on organisational change, organisational {{learning and the}} role of the top team prompted the question: what is the relationship between top teams and organisational leaming? It seemed that role of the top team was important to attain successful change and ultimately learning. Yet how this was achieved seemed to be poorly understood in the literature. Thus, the thesis focused attention on the dynamics of the top team, its organisational context and the state of the external environment to gain a clearer understanding of these relationships. In order to deepen that understanding, the thesis took a systemic and psychoanalytical approach and a clinical research methodology, which provided a different perspective and seemed to be more suited to this type of inquiry on organisational dynamics. The 'findings' from the three, in-depth, public sector case studies suggested that while the dynamics of the top team could impact negatively on the group task, its impact on strategic organisational learning was less significant. The main conclusion drawn from the study was that strategic organisational learning was impaired not so much by the top team's dynamics, but by organisational and systemic defensive routines. The source of these recursive pattems was threefold: psychodynamic ego and social defenses among top team members, within the top team's group and within the dynamics of the Board A poor 'holding environment' so that these organisational dynamics were not sufficiently contained and thus each strategic subsystem was less 'task' focused an <b>underbounded</b> strategic apex that reinforced the dysfunctional dynamics already in play The implication from these public sector, case studies was that while the external environment and the dynamics of the top team were not insignificant, it was the poor quality and instability of the internal organisational context that inhibited learning.

I {{will review the}} major changes in the distribution of the metropolitan population of the United States (US), as revealed by the 2010 data recently released by the US Census. These data allow us to track recent changes and provide the basis for a discussion of longer-term trends identified in previous studies of US cities (Short 2006, 2007) and the city suburban nexus (Hanlon et al. 2010). In brief summary, the paper will show the continuing metropolitanization and suburbanization of the US population. A more nuanced picture will reveal evidence of stress in suburban areas and population resurgence in selected central city areas. Overall, the story is one of a profound revalorization and a major respatialization of the US metropolis. 1. The Broad Picture The mean center of the US mainland population is plotted for each Census decade since 1790. The point marks the central fulcrum of the national population. In 1790 the mean center was located in Maryland and over the years has steadily moved westward in line with the westward shift of population. Between 1970 and 1980, the mean center crossed the Mississippi River, and by 2000 it was located in Phelps County Missouri. By 2010, it shifted further westwards and southward to Texas County in Missouri. The slow, steady shift of the mean center marks the redistribution of the US population to the expanding metro areas of the South and West. Its slow progress, however, reminds us of the continuing population weight of the Northeast. The mean population center now passes through the interior of the country, the so-called heartland. Yet it is a heart with an anemic demographic beat. The population of six counties in this region—Fayette, Marion, Randolph, and Shelby in Illinois and Montgomery and Dent in Missouri— was 144, 880 in 1950, rising to only 145, 309 in 2010. In much of the rural interior of the US, the story is one of continuing relative population decline as the people move to the city regions. The county that hosted the mean center of population in 2010 —Texas County, Missouri—saw only slight population increase from 18, 992 in 1950 to 26, 008 in 2010. The percentage of persons in the county living below the poverty rate was 24. 4 percent in 2010 —almost double the national average—and the median household income was only three-fifths of the national average. The rural heartland is losing population and experiencing economic stress. 2. ContinuingMetropolitanization The drift of population to large cities continues. The US census employs the term metropolitan statistical area (MSA) to refer to urban areas with a core area of at least 50, 000 and economic links to surrounding counties. Using this statistical, rather than political division of municipal boundaries, it is possible to measure the metropolitanization of the US population. In 1950 the metropolitan population was just over a half at 56. 1 percent of the total US population. By 2010 the figure was 83. 6. The US population is increasingly and overwhelmingly concentrated in metropolitan areas. More than 90 percent of the country’s entire population growth in the last decade occurred within MSAs. A further 10 percent of the US population lives in micropolitan statistical areas, which contain an urban core of at least 10, 000 and, in total, have less than 50, 000 population. Only 6. 3 percent (versus 6. 8 percent in 2000) live outside these two types of urban areas. The US continues to become a more urban and metropolitan society. 2 International Journal of Population Research When we break down the metropolitan areas by size, there are differential growth rates. Table 1 shows the population for different sized MSAs from 1980 to 2010. The greatest growth was concentrated in the smaller sized metro areas. The steady growth of the largest, that is, greater than 5 million population, MSAs, from 1980 to 2000, is now eclipsed by the increasing growth rate of the smaller sized MSAs. This is partly a function of reclassification as smaller urban areas become classified as MSAs but also perhaps indicative of a greater spread of economic activity and population down the hierarchy of MSAs. Table 2 lists the twenty largest MSAs from 1950 to 2010. Notice the stability {{at the very top of}} the hierarchy with New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia and San Francisco keeping their position in the top ten over this 60 - year period. There is also change as Sunbeltmetro areas enter the top twenty. There were six metro areas in 2010 that were not part of the top twenty in 1950 —Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Orlando, Sacramento, and San Juan. The inclusion of San Juan, in Puerto Rico, now involves a wider definition of the “national” urban system than one restricted to mainland USA. 3. Central Cities The metropolitan region can be divided into central city and suburban areas. The most significant feature of the last sixty years is the suburbanization of the US population. In 1950 only 23 percent of the US population was living in suburbs. This figure increased to 46. 8 percent in 2010. The central city population has remained relatively fixed at around one-third of the entire population. In 2010 it was 36. 9 percent. The story of the central city of MSAs is complex. Short and Mussman (forthcoming) plot the individual trajectory of the population size at each successive Census since 1900 of the top 100 cities and identify four model types. The first type of city is steady decline. A typical city in this category is Detroit that experienced a peak of 1. 84 million around midtwentieth century and then continuous decline; its 2010 population was 713, 777 down from 951, 270 in 2000. The city embodies the rise and rapid fall of the older, <b>underbounded,</b> industrial city. Other cities in this category include Akron, Baltimore, Birmingham, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Cleveland, New Orleans, Rochester, Toledo, and Pittsburgh. In these cities the loss of employment caused by the long slow decline of manufacturing is yet to be replaced completely by new forms of economic growth. These cities also bear the brunt of an urban fiscal crisis as the steady loss of population and tax base erodes the revenues of the city. The second type of city is continuous increase. Here the story is of rising economic and population growth and ease of annexation. A typical case is San Jose, CA, a Sunbelt city with an expanding economy based largely on information technology. In 1950 the city population was only 95, 280, but by 2010 it was 945, 942. Decades of spectacular growth fueled in particular by the Silicon Valley boom in hightechnology and computer-related industries make San Jose one of the most prosperous and economically dynamic cities 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 Population (millions) Decade Figure 1 : Population of New York City. in the country. In 2010, San Jose’s median household income was $ 76, 794, compared to the national median household income of $ 50, 046. The city was also able to annex territory, increasing its area size from 17 square miles in 1950 to 177 in 2010. Other examples of this type include San Diego, CA, Las Vegas, NV, and Orlando, FL. The third model type is growth interrupted. Here examples include New York City (NYC), Atlanta, San Francisco, and Seattle. These cities’ upward population trajectory saw some decline before returning to growth and eventually surpassing their previous population peak. Figure 1 plots the trajectory of New York City where the population was relatively flat from 1950 to 1970 before a 20 -year decline and then resurgence after 1990. The city’s areal size remained constant at 303 square miles from 1950 to 2010. In Atlanta, there was rapid growth from 1950 to 1970 followed by 30 years of decline before population began to up tick again after 2000. In the case of Seattle, population peaked in 1960 then declined before growth returned by the 1990 census. The city was the same size in 2010 — 84 square miles—as it was in 1960. In this category some annexations did occur, but, especially for the large cities of Atlanta, New York, San Francisco, and Seattle, population growth within stable boundaries was the most important process. Then there is the slowly resurgent city, where previous peaks are not reached, but there is a slow steady return of population. Examples include Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC. In all three cases the areal size of|$|R
