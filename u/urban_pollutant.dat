Results There were no significant differences in the mean values of resting ventilatory capacity, the forced spirometric test, or in blood gas parameters between the groups. The traffic exposed group demonstrated a number of significant changes in cardio respiratory measures on exercise testing. Twenty-six traffic policemen and none of the controls experienced exercise-induced ECG abnormalities, hypertension or oxyhaemoglobin desaturation; 80 % of the 26 had resting PaO 2 values < 80 mmHg.

The results of our study show that. (1) while smoker workers have a higher risk for developing solid suspicious lung nodules, the simple routinely exposure to <b>urban</b> <b>pollutants</b> is unable to produce the same kind of increased risk; (2) the interaction of smoking and exposure to <b>urban</b> <b>pollutants</b> greatly increases the risk for the development of solid suspicious lung nodules.

40|$|Two {{semi-continuous}} Sunset carbon analyzers, {{with different}} peak inert mode temperatures (615 and 740 ℃), were simultaneously operated to measure fine {{particulate organic carbon}} (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) using a thermal optical transmittance method at an urban site in Beijing, China, from 16 August to 3 September 2006 during the CAREBeijing 2006 campaign. Excellent agreements were obtained between the collocated semi-continuous carbon analyzers, with slopes of 1. 02 (R 2 = 0. 91) for OC and 1. 06 (R 2 = 0. 93) for EC, resulting in very similar average EC/total carbon (TC) ratios of ∼ 0. 36. These results imply that the different peak inert mode (100 % helium) temperatures did not cause significant biases on the semi-continuous OC and EC measurements. However, {{it was found that}} the EC/TC ratio was greatly influenced by the accumulated refractory particles remaining on a quartz filter (PM refractory). Fresh quartz filters, with low PM refractory loadings, which is defined as a laser correction factor ≥ 0. 94, gave ∼ 8 - 10 % lower EC/TC ratios than aged quartz filters with high PM refractory loadings. The linear regression slope between EC and optically measured EC (OPT-EC) was much higher with fresh quartz filters (slope = 1. 03, R 2 = 0. 96) than aged quartz filters (slope = 0. 89, R 2 = 0. 95), suggesting the underestimation of EC on fresh quartz filters by ∼ 15 % compared to those measured on aged quartz filters. Authentic standard humic-like substances (HULIS) on the clean quartz filter showed the highest extent of pyrolyzed organic carbon (POC) formation (47. 4 % in total detected carbon mass), followed by those on the Asian dust loaded quartz filter (37 %) and the refractory <b>urban</b> <b>pollutant</b> loaded quartz filter (34. 1 %), indicating that the Asian dust and refractory <b>urban</b> <b>pollutant</b> reduced the POC formation from the HULIS. Thus, this study suggested that the PM refractory loading plays an important role in the semi-continuous OC and EC measurements by altering the degree of POC formation in the inert atmosphere...|$|E

In fact, the muscle {{biochemical}} parameters were able to show fluctuations in response to the changes in different study sites during different water flow periods. It appeared that the <b>urban</b> <b>pollutant</b> loads via untreated effluents of the Lahore city have been exerting drastic negative effects on fish health. However, some of the negative effects appeared to be partly mitigated by a higher river flow at some parts of the city. These observations clearly demonstrate that the fish life has been affected at the river’s study segment. Therefore, prompt action is needed to strictly regulate the influx of urban effluents into the Ravi River to safeguard the aquatic and public health. Meanwhile, further studies should be conducted by covering a longer distance along the Ravi River around Lahore city to reveal the impact of other sources of pollutions on different fish species of river Ravi.|$|E

The development of photocatalytic construction materials can contribute to clean the air and improve sustainability levels. Previous studies have focused mainly in cement and concrete materials, disregarding the potential application in historic buildings. In this work, a photocatalytic additive (titanium dioxide) was added to mortars prepared with aerial lime, cement and gypsum binders. The main goal was to study the way that microstructural changes affect the photocatalytic efficiency. The photocatalytic activity was determined using a reactor developed to assess the degradation rate with a common <b>urban</b> <b>pollutant,</b> NOR. The laboratory results show that all the compositions tested exhibited high photocatalytic efficiency. It was demonstrated that photocatalytic mortars can be applied in new and old buildings, because the nanoadditives do not compromise the mortar hardened state properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In follicular and lutheal phase of ovarian cycle, 17 -alpha-OH-P mean levels and the distribution of 17 -alpha-OH-P values were significantly higher in traffic police vs. controls. A higher instance of mental health disorders in traffic police vs. controls was found, although the difference was not significant.

40|$|An <b>urban</b> <b>pollutant</b> loading {{model was}} used to {{demonstrate}} how incorrect assumptions on the particle size distribution (PSD) in urban runoff can alter the design characteristics of stormwater control measures (SCMs) used to remove solids in stormwater. Field-measured PSD, although highly variable, is generally coarser than the widely-accepted PSD characterized by the Nationwide Urban Runoff Program (NURP). PSDs can be predicted based on environmental surrogate data. There were no appreciable differences in predicted PSD when grouped by season. Model simulations of a wet detention pond and catch basin showed a much smaller surface area is needed {{to achieve the same}} level of solids removal using the median value of field-measured PSD as compared to NURP PSD. Therefore, SCMs that used the NURP PSD in the design process could be unnecessarily oversized. The median of measured PSDs, although more site-specific than NURP PSDs, could still misrepresent the efficiency of an SCM because it may not adequately capture the variability of individual runoff events. Future pollutant loading models may account for this variability through regression with environmental surrogates, but until then, without proper site characterization, the adoption of a single PSD to represent all runoff conditions may result in SCMs that are under- or over-sized, rendering them ineffective or unnecessarily costly...|$|E

In this study the relative inhalation risk of emissions of a range of toxic compounds are reported using data from a study of in-service vehicles driven through urban drive cycles using a range of diesel fuel formulations.

Effects of vehicle type and fuel composition on the risk of emissions of a range of toxic species are reported. The results show that the inhalation cancer risk is dominated for most of the vehicles and the testing modes by emissions of the combustion derived products, particularly benzene, naphthalene, and formaldehyde, and not by the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a) pyrene. Based on the relative risk represented by these toxic species, improved fuel quality does not result in significant reductions in the relative inhalation cancer risk.

This effect could explain the association between episodic variations of urban pollutants and acute cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality documented in epidemiological studies. Because the lungs are {{the primary source of}} circulating ET- 1 and the main site of clearance from circulation, we investigated the response of endothelin system genes in the lungs of Fischer- 344 rats after 4 -h nose-only inhalation of 0. 8 ppm ozone plus 49 mg/m 3 EHC- 93 (Ottawa particles). The mRNA levels for preproET- 1, preproET- 3, endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) - 1, and ET receptor subtypes A and B were determined at 2 h, and 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days after exposure. The pollutants induced preproET- 1 and ECE- 1 (P< 0. 05) after 2 h, consistent with the notion of increased synthesis and conversion of the peptide ET- 1 in lung endothelial cells. PreproET- 3 mRNA was down-regulated at 2 h post-exposure (P< 0. 05), and returned to control levels by 24 h, indicating that induction of ET- 3 in the lungs is not responsible for the sustained elevation of ET- 3 in plasma reported after inhalation of pollutants. Our results indicate that lung endothelin system genes respond rapidly and transiently to inhalation of urban pollutants, consistent with the dynamics of <b>urban</b> <b>pollutant</b> health effects in the human population...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{implementation}} of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000 / 60 /CE requires Member States {{to gain a better}} understanding of priority pollutants entering surfaces waters. All kinds of effluents as well as urban water (wastewater and stormwater) are concerned. So, studies have put the light on direct discharges of these substances to the aquatic environment, since hazardous pollutants, listed or not in the WFD, could be released to a watercourse by stormwater. Moreover, data about priority substances in urban stormwater are scarce so far worldwide.

40|$|Street-level {{concentrations}} of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and particulate matter (PM) exceed public health standards in many cities, causing increased mortality and morbidity. Concentrations {{can be reduced}} by controlling emissions, increasing dispersion, or increasing deposition rates, but {{little attention has been}} paid to the latter as a pollution control method. Both NO 2 and PM are deposited onto surfaces at rates that vary according to the nature of the surface; deposition rates to vegetation are much higher than those to hard, built surfaces. Previously, city-scale studies have suggested that deposition to vegetation can make a very modest improvement (< 5 %) to urban air quality. However, few studies take full account of the interplay between urban form and vegetation, specifically the enhanced residence time of air in street canyons. This study shows that increasing deposition by the planting of vegetation in street canyons can reduce street-level concentrations in those canyons by as much as 40 % for NO 2 and 60 % for PM. Substantial street-level air quality improvements can be gained through action at the scale of a single street canyon or across city-sized areas of canyons. Moreover, vegetation will continue to offer benefits in the reduction of pollution even if the traffic source is removed from city centers. Thus, judicious use of vegetation can create an efficient <b>urban</b> <b>pollutant</b> filter, yielding rapid and sustained improvements in street-level air quality in dense urban areas...|$|E
40|$|Radon is {{increasingly}} {{being used as}} a tool for quantifying stability influences on <b>urban</b> <b>pollutant</b> concentrations. Bulk radon gradients are ideal for this purpose, since the vertical differencing substantially removes contributions from processes on timescales greater than diurnal and (assuming a constant radon source) gradients are directly related to the intensity of nocturnal mixing. More commonly, however, radon measurements are available only at a single height. In this study we argue that single-height radon observations should not be used quantitatively as an indicator of atmospheric stability without prior conditioning of the time series to remove contributions from larger-scale "non-local" processes. We outline a simple technique to obtain an approximation of the diurnal radon gradient signal from a single-height measurement time series, and use it to derive a four category classification scheme for atmospheric stability on a "whole night" basis. A selection of climatological and pollution observations in the Sydney region are then subdivided according to the radon-based scheme on an annual and seasonal basis. We compare the radon-based scheme against a commonly used Pasquill–Gifford (P–G) type stability classification and reveal that the most stable category in the P–G scheme is less selective of the strongly stable nights than the radon-based scheme; this lead to significant underestimation of pollutant concentrations on the most stable nights by the P–G scheme. Lastly, we applied the radon-based classification scheme to mixing height estimates calculated from the diurnal radon accumulation time series, which provided insight to the range of nocturnal mixing depths expected at the site for each of the stability classes. © 2015, Author(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Terrestrial runoff {{and river}} input dominates <b>urban</b> <b>pollutant</b> loading rates Often {{draining}} {{directly into the}} surfzone, this pollution degrades surfzone water quality, leading to beach closures (e. g., Boehm et al., 2002), increases health risks (e. g., diarrhea and upper respiratory illness) (Haile et al., 1999), and contains both human viruses (Jiang and Chu, 2004) and elevated levels of fecal indicator bacteria (Reeves et al., 2004). Surfzone mixing processes disperse and dilute such (and other types of) pollution. On smaller length-scales (smaller than the water depth), breaking-waves and bed-generated turbulence mix tracer. However, field surfzone observations of turbulence previously have been extremely scarce, and much about surfzone small-scale turbulence is not known. On larger scales (10 – 100 m), horizontal dispersion is driven by surfzone eddies and meanders associated with shear waves (Oltman-Shay et al., 1989) or finite breaking crest length (Peregrine, 1998). Understanding the small and large length-scale mixing processes important to predicting the fate (transport, dispersal, and dilution) of surfzone tracers whether pollution, bacteria, larvae, or nutrients. OBJECTIVES The scientific objective is to improve understanding and modeling of dispersion of tracers (pollution, fecal indicator bacteria, fine sediments) within the nearshore (a few 100 m of the shoreline) and especially within the surfzone where breaking waves intensify mixing processes and drive strong mean currents. We have focused on two components of analysis of the HB 06 experiment performed in Fall of 2006. The first is studying the small-scale turbulence in the surfzone due to breaking waves and the second, is larger scale surfzone Lagrangian drifter dispersion. Other efforts include analysis of dye tracer mixing and phytoplankton patchiness at HB 06. APPROAC...|$|E
