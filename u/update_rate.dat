40|$|The {{manual control}} of the camera of an {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) can be difficult due to several factors such as 1) time delays between steering input and changes of the monitor content, 2) low <b>update</b> <b>rates</b> of the camera images and 3) lack of situation awareness due to the remote position of the operator and the small field {{of view of the}} camera images.

In an experiment, participants inspected roads and edges of wood with and without the 3 D map. A 2 D map with the same information as the 3 D map was available in all conditions. With the 3 D map, the participants: 1) were able to inspect larger areas, especially when the task became more difficult due to time delays and low <b>update</b> <b>rates,</b> 2) were better able to perform an additional task, and 3) reported lower workload compared to the condition without the 3 D map.

50|$|Lag {{due to an}} {{insufficient}} <b>update</b> <b>rate</b> between {{client and}} server can cause some problems, but these are generally limited to the client itself. Other players may notice jerky movement and similar problems with the player associated with the affected client, but the real problem lies with the client itself. If the client cannot update the game state at a quick enough pace, the player may be shown outdated renditions of the game, which in turn cause various problems with hit- and collision detection. If the low <b>update</b> <b>rate</b> {{is caused by a}} low frame rate (as opposed to a setting on the client, as some games allow), these problems are usually overshadowed by numerous problems related to the client-side processing itself. Both the display and controls will be sluggish and unresponsive. While this may increase the perceived lag, {{it is important to note}} that it is of a different kind than network-related delays. In comparison, the same problem on the server may cause significant problems for all clients involved. If the server is unable or unwilling to accept packets from clients fast enough and process these in a timely manner, client actions may never be registered. When the server then sends out updates to the clients, they may experience freezing (unresponsive game) and/or rollbacks, depending on what types of lag compensation, if any, the game uses.|$|E
