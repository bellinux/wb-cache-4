50|$|A {{plate number}} coil (PNC) is a United States postage stamp {{with the number}} of the {{printing}} plate or plates printed on it. The plate number typically appears as one or more small digits in the margin {{at the bottom of the}} stamp. The plate number may be centered or, on some coil issues, located toward the right. Although most plate numbers are composed of just numbers, both a combination of letter and number may be used. In the case when a letter is represented in the plate number, an <b>upper</b> <b>case</b> <b>letter</b> usually appears at the beginning or at the end of the sequence with the former serving as a good identifier of the stamp printer.|$|E

An algorithm that only keeps track of [...] "current heading" [...] leads into an infinite loop as it leaves the lower rightmost wall heading left and runs into the curved section on the left hand side again. The Pledge algorithm does not leave the rightmost wall due to the [...] "sum of turns made" [...] not being zero at that point (note 360 degrees is not equal to 0 degrees). It follows the wall all the way around, finally leaving it heading left outside and just underneath the letter shape.|$|E
50|$|Serious {{study of}} Shakespeare's {{handwriting}} {{began in the}} 18th century with scholars Edmond Malone and George Steevens. By {{the late nineteenth century}} paleographers began to make detailed study of the evidence in the hope of identifying Shakespeare's handwriting in other surviving documents. In those cases when the actual handwriting is not extant, the study of the published texts has yielded indirect evidence of his handwriting quirks through reading and apparent misreadings by compositors. To give one example of this, in the early published versions of Shakespeare’s plays there occurs a recurrence of an <b>upper</b> <b>case</b> <b>letter</b> “C” when the lower case is called for. This might indicate that Shakespeare was fond of such a usage in his handwriting, and that the compositors (working from the handwriting) followed the usage. When trying to determine who the author is of either a printed work or a pen-and-ink manuscript, this is one possible method of discovering such indications.|$|E
