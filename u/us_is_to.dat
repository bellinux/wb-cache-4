2500|$|In 2008, former Intel Corporation Chairman and CEO Andrew Grove {{looked to}} energy resilience, arguing that {{complete}} independence is unfeasible given {{the global market}} for energy. He describes energy resilience {{as the ability to}} adjust to interruptions in the supply of energy. To that end, he suggests the U.S. make greater use of electricity. Electricity can be produced from a variety of sources. A diverse energy supply will be less affected by the disruption in supply of any one source. He reasons that another feature of electrification is that electricity is [...] "sticky" [...] – meaning the electricity produced in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> stay there because it cannot be transported overseas. [...] According to Grove, a key aspect of advancing electrification and energy resilience will be converting the U.S. automotive fleet from gasoline-powered to electric-powered. This, in turn, will require the modernization and expansion of the electrical power grid. As organizations such as The Reform Institute have pointed out, advancements associated with the developing smart grid would facilitate the ability of the grid to absorb vehicles en masse connecting to it to charge their batteries.|$|E
