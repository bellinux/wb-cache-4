40|$|Inaugural lecture [...] Department of Mercantile Law, University of Johannesburg, 19 October 2011 The {{ability to}} {{mobilise}} capital by attracting investments {{from the public}} {{was one of the}} driving forces {{in the development of the}} modern company. Companies finance their business operations through a combination of equity and debt. The choice between equity and debt financing depends on a variety of factors ranging from macro-economic factors such as the relative abundance or scarcity of capital, the costs of raising different types of financing and the tax treatment of debt and equity financing. A notion of <b>undercapitalisation</b> is recognised in several disciplines of the law, including tax law, company law and corporate insolvency law. As these disciplines have different purposes they employ different definitions of and attach different consequences to <b>undercapitalisation.</b> They employ mostly reactive or ex post strategies. Yet the recognition of the concept implies that there is an ideal standard according to which corporations should be capitalised - an idea of adequate capitalisation. The purpose of this lecture is to analyse some of these responses in search for common ground that may serve as the basis for a more proactive solution or guiding principle. Company law does not generally prescribe to what extent equity and debt financing should be relied on or, for that matter, the value of the total assets that a company should have. Some jurisdictions do prescribe a minimum capital or pay attention to the manner in which a company is to be financed, but such measures tend to have a limited impact beyond the incorporation phase of a company. Limited attempts are also made to scrutinise proposed financing methods when the continuance of a distressed company is under consideration. Although <b>undercapitalisation</b> is an important factor in imposing personal liability for the debts of a company based on the so-called veil-piercing cases, it is not generally regarded as an independent ground for the disregarding of corporate personality. This complicates formulation of a proactive approach. In international tax law, transfer pricing rules function as anti-avoidance measures that prevent the abnormal allocation of income and expenses between related or connected persons aimed at obtaining a tax benefit. These measures include thin capitalisation rules targeting the use of disproportionate levels of debt in relation to equity. They prevent the deduction of excessive interest payments in respect of debt financing by connected persons. While they treat debt financing as if it was in fact equity financing, this is done only in relation to the tax consequences. Nevertheless, it seems that tax law can provide useful guidance in the formulation of a concept of inadequate capitalisation. Corporate insolvency law provides several responses to <b>undercapitalisation,</b> including the equitable subordination of debt and the recharacterisation of debt as equity. While the requirements for and consequences of these two responses differ, both apply in respect of financing provided by insiders such as holding companies, controlling shareholders and certain creditors. The degree of correspondence between the types of financing subjected to these insolvency solutions and the transactions targeted by thin capitalisation rules is evident. The regulation of insider loans thus appears to be a good starting point in addressing the problem of corporate <b>undercapitalisation.</b> Insolvency law in Germany and in the United States of America provide useful guidance for the design of a South African approach...|$|E

40|$|Risk-sensitive capital requirements, such {{as those}} {{established}} in Basel 2 / 3, and loan loss provisions based on incurred losses or on short-horizon expected losses, increase procyclicality in the banking system. They could, therefore, contribute to fuelling credit bubbles in good times, as rising risks are not properly covered either with capital or provisions, and credit crunches in bad times, as requirements are sharply increased {{to compensate for the}} former <b>undercapitalisation</b> and under-provisioning, and banks respond by cutting credit to households and firms. This paper shows that the procyclicality of current and envisaged capital requirements and loan loss provisions is a serious concern. But, at the same time, it can be dealt with using countercyclical macroprudential tools, first, by smoothing minimum capital requirements using a very simple and intuitive formula based on GDP growth and, secondly, by using forward-looking provisions such as the Spanish dynamic provisions, a working macroprudential mechanism {{for more than a decade}} and a full lending cycle.

40|$|With the {{majority}} of large UK and many US banks collapsing or being forced to raise capital over the 2007 - 9 period, blaming bankers may be satisfying but is patently insufficient; Basel II and Federal oversight frameworks also deserve criticism. We propose that the current methodological void {{at the heart of}} Basel II, Pillar 2 is filled with the recommendation that banks develop fully-integrated models for economic capital that relate asset values to fundamental drivers of risk in the economy to capture systematic effects and inter-asset dependencies in a way that crude correlation assumptions do not. We implement a fully-integrated risk analysis based on the balance sheet of a composite European bank using an economic-scenario generation model calibrated to conditions at the end of 2007. Our results suggest that the more modular, correlation-based approaches to economic capital that currently dominate practice could have led to an <b>undercapitalisation</b> of banks, a result that is clearly of interest given subsequent events. The introduction of integrated economic-scenario-based models in future can improve capital adequacy, enhance Pillar 2 's application and rejuvenate the relevance of the Basel regulatory framework.

A series of spectacular market failures, most notably bank failure arising from <b>undercapitalisation,</b> caused in turn by ‘recklessness and irresponsibility all too often caused by greed’, has been presented to the reader as if Gordon Brown was a detached observer who could not have possibly previously been aware of the extent of risk-taking made possible by his own risk-based model of financial regulation. This paper argues Gordon Brown’s analysis is fundamentally flawed. We are not now living through the first crisis of globalisation. On the contrary, what Gordon Brown has actually documented is the first crisis of his own deeply flawed British model of political economy, which socialised risks and privatised profits.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the financial crisis in 2007 Germany has experienced a series of problems in the banking sector unseen for decades. Massive government intervention at high cost to the public purse was used to contain a more severe crisis. Similar interventions were necessary in a range of other countries. The financial crisis not only unveiled serious weaknesses in the supervision and regulation of the financial sector, but also revealed substantial flaws in financial institutions ’ internal risk management and governance structures. A major problem was the severe <b>undercapitalisation</b> of banks prior to the crisis. Therefore, capital adequacy was central in the debate on the crisis and major reforms in this area will be initiated with Basel III. Capital requirements have a long tradition in the banking regulation of Germany (and West Germany before unification). While for many countries capital requirements were first adopted in the 1970 s (Krahnen and Carletti, 2007), in Germany such regulation had already been introduced in the 1930 s. This paper will review the capital requirement regulation in Germany from a historical perspective, whereby it will identify general trends and point out some severe problems associated with the current approaches to capital requirement regulation. First, a short overview of the theoretical justifications for capital regulation is given. Then, the development of regulatory capital requirements in Germany before the financial crisis is examined in detail and its mos...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is a case}} study analysis of NetOne Cellular (Pvt) Ltd, a state enterprise in the mobile cellular telecommunications industry in Zimbabwe which has failed to perform to government and public expectation since its launch in 1996. At the advent of mobile telecommunications industry in Zimbabwe in the 1990 s, {{it was expected that}} the Government of Zimbabwe would reap huge revenues in the lucrative telecommunications industry by being the pioneer and monopolising the provision of mobile telecommunications in the country. Government therefore, set up NetOne, initially as a department under the Postal and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) and later turned it into an incorporated company in 2001. The company has however failed to perform to expectations despite the advantages which usually go with government protection and favouritism in comparison to its competitors Econet Wireless Zimbabwe and Telecel Zimbabwe. This study provides evidence of the company's poor performance, an analysis and discussion of the underlying and proximate causal factors thereto as well as a set of recommendations and possible ways forward. The study seeks to explore and prove that the Zimbabwean political settlements, mismanagement of economic rents, as well as the scourge of poor corporate, <b>undercapitalisation,</b> unfavourable sectoral and regulatory dynamics negatively impact on NetOne's performance. Derived from the foregoing the above are the cascading effects of inadequate leadership and business practices within the organisation which also {{played a major role in}} the company's modicum growth and underperformance over the years. It concludes that the Zimbabwe political settlements and failure to manage and effectively exploit political rents is the major contributor to the company's failure and lead to both external and internal poor governance of the company thereby affecting its performance...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of soldier land {{settlement}} in New Zealand after World War I. Entrenched in New Zealand folklore and historiography {{is the belief that}} the majority of soldier settlers failed and walked off their farms. This thesis, however, questions this orthodoxy and presents evidence showing that significant aspects of the soldier settlers' story have, for ideological and political reasons, been misunderstood and misrepresented by later writers who have been blinkered to the achievements of the Reform Government. Closely tied to this traditional notion of failure are assumptions about the high cost and poor quality of land involved, and the inexperience and <b>undercapitalisation</b> of the settlers. This study pays particular attention to {{the development and implementation of}} government policy. It shows that land purchase and its distribution, and on-going support for settlers by the Government, were based on more sophisticated and discerning policies than later writers have allowed. This study examines the expectations of the primary parties in the settlement process and shows how these expectations were both perceived and presented in the media as unfulfilled. More soldiers survived on their farms than is generally recognised. This was the result of deliberate government policy in response to uncertain economic conditions during the interwar period. This survival rate was not without cost, both in economic terms for the Crown, and in personal terms for the participating soldiers. The farming experience of the interwar period was not as the soldiers expected - faced as they were with a loss of individual freedom and the development of financial dependency. The dominating image to have survived in the historical orthodoxy is that the soldiers were betrayed. This was based upon the strength of their moral claims to recognition and recompense from the community which they had defended. However, this thesis argues that any betrayal was actually of the Arcadian expectations with which the soldiers had returned to New Zealand, and of the heady expectations that the community initially had of the soldiers. These hopes and ideals, it is suggested, proved to be irreconcilable with contemporary political and economic realities. The perceived experience of the soldiers nevertheless assured them their status as victims...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM DISCUSSION: Small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises are observed as capable instruments {{to solving the}} critical problems of development and poverty affecting most developing countries (Kayanula and Quartey 2000; Mead and Liedholm 1998; Fischer 1995), therefore the need for their growth in Nigeria is beyond question. Amidst many other problems, gaining access to bank credits and other financial markets {{have been identified as}} a key hindrance to this growth. This thesis tried to review this challenging problem of SMEs financing in Nigeria with a view of identifying alternative financing options besides the traditional banks credit system. It also takes a look at Non-bank financial institutions as one of such alternative options of financing for SMEs. PURPOSE: To review the challenging problem of SMEs financing in Nigeria and secondly to identify other alternative financing options available to SMEs such as the Non-bank financial institutions. METHOD: For the most part of this work, empirical data has been collected from secondary sources. Also, primary data collected was from a conducted survey received from fifteen SMEs within Lagos city in Nigeria. KEYWORDS: Non-Bank Financial Institutions, Financing, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. INTRODUCTION Given the great potential of small and medium sized enterprises to bring about social and economic development, it is of no surprise that the performance of SMEs is of all huge concern to the government of different countries in the world. Small and medium sized enterprises in both developing and developed countries plays important roles in the process of industrialization and economic growth, by significantly contributing to employment generation, income generation and catalyzing development in urban and rural areas (Hallberg, 2000; Olutunla, 2001; OECD, 2004; Williams, 2006). As affirmed by one estimate, Africa and Asia has the majority of their population living in rural areas where small scale enterprises delivers about 20 % - 45 % of full-time employment and 30 % - 50 % of rural household income (Haggblade and Liedholm 1991). Latin America, which is more urbanized, has an estimated 50 million micro and small-scale enterprises, employing 120 million people (Berger and Guillamon 1996). In Nigeria, according to a report, an estimate of about 70 % of the industrial employment is held by SMEs and more than 50 % of the Gross Domestic Product (Odeyemi, 2003) is SMEs generated. Given the seminal role of SMEs to the economy of Nigeria, various regimes of government since independence in the 1960 s, have focused on various progammes and spent immense amount of money with the primary goal of developing this sector, these have however not yielded any significant results (Mambula 1997) as evident in the present state of the SMEs in the country. SMEs are generally very susceptible and only a certain number of them manage to survive due to several factors such as difficulty in accessing credits from banks and other financial institutions; harsh economic conditions which results from unstable government policies; gross <b>undercapitalisation,</b> inadequacies resulting from the highly dilapidated state of Infrastructural facilities; astronomically high operating costs; lack of transparency and corruption; and the lack of interest and lasting support for the SMEs sector by government authorities, to mention a few (Oboh 2002; Okpara 2000; Wale-Awe 2000). Despite the numerous factors that challenge the survival and growth of SMEs in both developing and developed countries, finance has been identified {{as one of the most}} important factor (UNCTAD, 1995, 2001; SBA, 2000). Having access to finance gives SMES the chance to develop their businesses and to acquire better technologies for production, therefore ensuring their competiveness, however, there is a huge challenge for SMES globally when it comes to sourcing for initial and expansion capital funds from traditional commercial banks. Abereijo and Fayomi (2005) notes that the majority of commercial bank loans offered to SMEs are often also limited to a period far too short to pay off any sizeable investment. In addition, banks in many developing Countries prefers to lend to the government rather than private sector borrowers because the risk involved is lesser and higher returns are offered (Levitsky, 1997), such apathy for the SMES have crowded out most private sector borrowers and increased the cost of capital for them. The situation is equally prevalent in the Nigerian economy where commercial banks often prefer to lend to government, trade in foreign exchange (FOREX), and financing buying and selling. A banker in Nigeria aptly put such preferences that “the banks are not a charity, hence why should they take risks with SMEs when they can make good money elsewhere”. These preferences and tendencies of the commercial banks have worsened the lack of financing for SMEs. The Financial systems in every country play a key role in the development and growth of the economy, although the ability to play this role effectively and efficiently largely depends on the degree of development of the financial system. The traditional commercial banks which are key players in the financial systems of nearly every economy, have the potential to pull financial resources together to meet the credit needs of SMEs, however, there is still a huge gap between supply capabilities of the banks and the demanding needs of SMEs. In Nigeria, the situation is even more prevalent as noted by Olutunla and Obamuyi (2008). ’’There is a huge supply of both equity and loan able funds in the commercial banking sector which the SMEs are not benefiting from. For example, as at the end of the first quarter of 2007, out of N 38. 2 billion set aside under the scheme by the banks, only N 18. 1 billion or 47. 3 % had been assessed by the SMEs (CBN, 2007). Similarly, the Financial Guidelines every year stipulate that banks must dedicate a minimum proportion of their loan portfolio to the SMEs. However, since the 1970 s the banks have not met this requirement. On the demand side, the SMEs have been reluctant to seek bank loans despite the various loan schemes being offered by the banks and the government, because of the fear of the business being taking away in case of any problem to meet the agreed terms’’ Another important part of the financial systems apart from the traditional commercial bank are the non bank financial institutions (NBFIs), which together with commercial banks, provide a wide range of financial products and services to meet the financial need of businesses, households and the public sector. They include companies such as insurance, leasing, factoring, venture capital companies, as well as mutual funds, pension funds, and investment trusts, which all provide additional and alternative financial services. NBFIs help in improving the general system-wide access to finance, facilitate longer-term investments and financing, and also provide competition for bank deposits. According to the World Bank 2006 report, NBFIs allow for better risk management while helping to reduce the potential for systemic risk through the aggregation of resources, allocation of risk to those more willing to bear it, and application of portfolio management techniques that spread risk across diversified parts of the financial system. They serve to improve competition and increase the depth of the financial market. By reducing concentration and providing alternative sources of finance, NBFIs, as former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said, “enhances the resilience of the financial system to economic shocks by providing it with an effective ‘spare tyre’ in times of need. ” The question therefore arises that if traditional commercial banks are failing in fulfilling the financial needs of SMEs, are NBFIs also doing the same? Is there a possibility that SMEs are not taking full advantage of the services and products of the NBFIs to improve the prevalent problem of access finance? It is the objective of this thesis to review the challenges that SMES face in accessing finance from traditional commercial banks and also investigate other alternative sources for SMEs to access finance such as the NBFIs. Can the NBFIs be the effective ‘spare tyre’ for the SMEs in Nigeria when dealing with issues of financial services?+ 4673631948...|$|E
