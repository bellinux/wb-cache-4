Based on these analytical models, a suboptimal value of redundant packets, which makes both the quality of video stream and the effective <b>utilization</b> <b>ratio</b> of FEC approximate their maximum, is calculated by predicting the quality of video stream and effective <b>utilization</b> <b>ratio</b> of FEC under different network conditions (characterized by packet loss probability in this paper).

As the laser traverses across the substrate in a layer-by-layer fashion, a fully dense metal is left in its path. A few processing parameters involved with the LMDS include the laser power, traverse speed, powder feeding rate, and gas flow rate, etc, which affect many factors of LMDS technology. Among them, the powder <b>utilization</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is an important one}} because it directly determines the build rate and build height per layer.

We explore {{shipping companies}}' two problems: evaluating supply and demand {{of the market and}} assigning cargoes in order to maximize profitability. By approximating the market as a queueing system, we obtain <b>utilization</b> <b>ratios,</b> which effectively model supply and demand of the market. This approach directly evaluates the impact of ton-mile on <b>utilization</b> <b>ratios,</b> even a small growth of which may result in a significant supply shortage. Queueing approximation also allows formulation of dynamic ship assignment as a semi-Markov average cost problem, attaining stationary policies. When profit margins are low, a stationary policy frequently rejects cargoes. Despite rejections, it yields the highest profit per cargo, compared to other methods. Such optimal controls remain valid even when demand fluctuates. by Yoo Joon Kim. Thesis: S.

The status {{of knowledge of}} Safety Criteria I and II (achieving operating speed consistency and design consistency) for two-lane rural roads is briefly reviewed. Considerations for design consistency are also extended to multiple-lane rural and suburban road design to evaluate good, fair, and poor design levels for these road categories. <b>Utilization</b> <b>ratios</b> (n) for maximum permissible side friction factors are developed for different road categories, topography levels, and maximum and minimum superelevation rates. Relevant minimum radii for curve design are established and compared with present AASHTO values insofar as possible. Safety Criterion III (achieving driving dynamic consistency) is further developed, through which reliable and quantitative ranges between the side friction assumed and the actual friction demand at curved sites could be established. AASHTO's design policy is evaluated {{on the basis of}} Criteria II and III. The evaluation showed, for lower design speeds (30, 40, and 50 mph), an unbalanced degree of curve and superelevation rate ranges, which lead to poor design practices from a safety viewpoint.

We determined incidence rates and characteristics of ventilator-associated events reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network. Design, Setting, and Patients:We analyzed data reported from U. S. healthcare facilities for ventilator-associated events that occurred in 2014, the first year during which ventilator-associated event surveillance definitions were stable. We used negative binomial regression modeling to identify healthcare facility and inpatient location characteristics associated with ventilator-associated events. We calculated ventilator-associated event incidence rates, rate distributions, and ventilator <b>utilization</b> <b>ratios</b> in critical care and noncritical care locations and described event characteristics. Measurements and Main Results:A total of 1, 824 healthcare facilities reported 32, 772 location months of ventilator-associated event surveillance data to the National Healthcare Safety Network in 2014. Critical care unit pooled mean ventilator-associated event incidence rates ranged from 2. 00 to 11. 79 per 1, 000 ventilator days, whereas noncritical care unit rates ranged from 0 to 14. 86 per 1, 000 ventilator days. The pooled mean proportion of ventilator-associated events defined as infection-related varied from 15. 38 % to 47. 62 % in critical care units. Pooled mean ventilator <b>utilization</b> <b>ratios</b> in critical care units ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 47. Conclusions:We found substantial variability in ventilator-associated event incidence, proportions of ventilator-associated events characterized as infection-related, and ventilator utilization within and among location types.

One of the common problems of carsharing is that companies can have difficulty optimizing the number of vehicles in operation.

A discrete event simulation is run to analyze a round-trip service for every possible number of cars and number of reservations with the output acceptance ratio and <b>utilization</b> <b>ratio.</b> The simulation data revealed that increasing the number of reservations with respect to a certain number of cars will decrease the acceptance ratio, thus increasing the percentage of the <b>utilization</b> <b>ratio.</b> Based on the simulation data results, a rational regression model can achieve high precision when predicting the acceptance ratio or the <b>utilization</b> <b>ratio</b> compared to other prediction algorithms such as the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) models.
