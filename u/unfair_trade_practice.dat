25|$|The {{types of}} claims are {{dependent}} upon {{the nature of the}} corporation. For public companies, claims are primarily due to lawsuits by shareholders after financial difficulties, with a 2011 Towers Watson survey finding that 69% of publicly traded company respondents had a claim for a shareholder lawsuit in the past 10 years as opposed to 21% of private companies respondents. Other claims arise from shareholder-derivative actions, creditors (particularly after entering the zone of insolvency), customers, regulators (including those that would bring civil and criminal charges), and competitors (for anti-trust or <b>unfair</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practice</b> allegations). For nonprofits, claims are typically related to employment practice and less commonly regulatory or other fiduciary claims. For private companies, claims are often from competitors or customers for antitrust or deceptive business practices and one survey of 451 executives found that lawsuits cost an average of $308,475.|$|E

2500|$|At {{any point}} {{employers}} can freely bargain with union representatives {{and make a}} collective agreement. A collective agreement will often be long, but aim to get rights including a fair day's wage for a fair day's work, reasonable notice and severance pay before any necessary layoffs, just cause for any job termination, and arbitration to resolve disputes. A union can encourage an employing entity through collective action to sign a deal, without using the NLRA 1935 procedure. But, if an employing entity refuses {{to deal with a}} union, and a union wishes, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) may oversee a legal process up to the conclusion of a legally binding collective agreement. By law, the NLRB is meant to have five members [...] "appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate", and {{play a central role in}} promoting collective bargaining. First, the NLRB will determine an appropriate [...] "bargaining unit" [...] of employees with employers (e.g., offices in a city, or state, or whole economic sector), The NLRB favors [...] "enterprise bargaining" [...] over [...] "sectoral collective bargaining", which means US unions have traditionally been smaller with less bargaining power by international standards. Second, a union with [...] "majority" [...] support of employees in a bargaining unit become [...] "the exclusive representatives of all the employees". But to ascertain majority support, the NLRB supervises the fairness of elections among the workforce. It is typical for the NLRB to take six weeks from a petition from workers to an election being held. During this time, managers may attempt to persuade or coerce employees using high-pressure tactics or unfair labor practices (e.g. threatening job termination, alleging unions will bankrupt the firm) to vote against recognizing the union. The average time for the NLRB to decide upon complaints of unfair labor practices had grown to 483 days in 2009 when its last annual report was written. Third, if a union does win majority support in a bargaining unit election, the employing entity will have an [...] "obligation to bargain collectively". This means meeting union representatives [...] "at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms" [...] to put in a [...] "written contract". The NLRB cannot compel an employer to agree, but it was thought that the NLRB's power to sanction an employer for an [...] "unfair labor practice" [...] if they did not bargain in good faith would be sufficient. For example, in JI Case Co v NLRB the Supreme Court held an employer could not refuse to bargain on the basis that individual contracts were already in place. Crucially, in Wallace Corp v NLRB the Supreme Court also held that an employer only bargaining with a company union that it dominated was an unfair labor practice, as it should have recognized the truly independent union affiliated to the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). However, in NLRB v Sands Manufacturing Co the Supreme Court held an employer did not commit an <b>unfair</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practice</b> by shutting down a water heater plant, while the union was attempting to prevent new employees being paid less. Moreover, after 2007 President George W. Bush and the Senate refused to make any appointments to the Board, and it was held by five judges, over four dissents, in New Process Steel LP v NLRB that rules made by two remaining members were ineffective. While appointments were made in 2013, agreement was not reached on one vacant seat. Increasingly it has been made politically unfeasible for the NLRB to act to promote collective bargaining.|$|E
