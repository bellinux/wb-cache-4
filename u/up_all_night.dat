5|$|The album {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics, {{many of whom}} appreciated the album's combination of melodic song craft and catchy, pop-oriented material that, while slickly produced, avoided the commercial cynicism and adult contemporary posturing {{of some of their}} '80s and '90s forebears.

5|$|According to Sorkin, {{the episode}} benefited greatly from input by two former White House employees. The scene where Donna stays <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>night</b> sorting through {{documents}} in cartons {{was the idea}} of Eli Attie, Al Gore's chief speechwriter. Meanwhile Gene Sperling, Bill Clinton's chief economic adviser, came up with the sub-plot involving the estate tax. Sorkin, however, had certain misgivings about the estate tax story's appeal, considering the prevalent bipartisan spirit of the time, {{in the aftermath of the}} 9/11 attacks.|$|E

5|$|Cynthia {{knew her}} husband took drugs like Preludin, and {{regularly}} smoked cannabis but {{thought of them}} as not being very dangerous.

Although told not to leave the house, Harrison drove them to various nightclubs, with Riley following them by taxi. At the Ad Lib club, they thought the lift up to the club was on fire and started screaming, before finally crawling out of the lift for which Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, and Starr were waiting. Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd's Mini Cooper at no more than 10mph, as he was also feeling the effects of the drug. They stayed <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>night</b> at Kenwood, experiencing the full effects of their first LSD trip.|$|E
5|$|On the DVD Commentary, series creator Rob Thomas {{opined that}} the {{relationship}} between Veronica and Keith was the core of the series and listed the scene in which Keith stays <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>night</b> before scaring Veronica in the morning as one of his favorite examples of their chemistry in the season. Thomas highlighted the scene in which a girl shows Veronica around the sorority as indicative of Hansen's comedic talents; in addition, it marked the first appearance of David Tom in the season, a guest star in season two who was brought back for a recurring role in this season.
