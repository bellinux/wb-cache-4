As the fleet grew, the need for more depots was felt. In 1961 the fleet comprised 1045 buses. Six new depots were constructed for their maintenance. The Wadala depot was equipped for the maintenance of 300 buses. At this time it was the largest depot in Asia. After this, taking long maintenance experience into account, the authorities decided that no depot should be called on to look after more than 125 to 150 buses. Accordingly, small depots were built at convenient spots in the city and its suburbs. Every depot is another work center, which provides bus services effectively on every day, carries out preventive maintenance as well as repairs on buses. Depots carry out maintenance practices such as preventive maintenance, <b>unit</b> <b>replacement,</b> RTO passing, body damage repairs of buses. BEST buses are operated out of the 26 bus depot located in four zones viz. City, Central, Western, Eastern & Suburban zones.|$|E
