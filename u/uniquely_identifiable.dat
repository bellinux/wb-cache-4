5|$|From 1840 to 1844, the Penny Black, {{and other}} stamps issued, were obliterated with the Maltese Cross cancellation. There was no text or numeral to help {{identify}} any of these cancels as Irish, but some Maltese Crosses are <b>uniquely</b> <b>identifiable</b> with certain Irish towns, including Belfast, Eyrecourt, Cork, Hollymount, Limerick and Mullingar. From 1844 on, the cancels used included text or numerals that identified the post town. Cancels of both types are easier to identify if the stamp is still affixed to a cover, since this makes the complete postmark visible, but a stamp no longer affixed to a cover may still permit identification {{of the town of}} use if enough of the postmark can be seen on the stamp itself. Numerals of Irish town cancels were uniquely set in a 4 pointed diamond shape whereas town cancels in England and Wales used an oval shape and Scotland used a rectangular form.|$|E

40|$|The {{definite}} determiner “the ” {{conveys a}} {{relation between the}} entity referred to by the noun phrase and the description provided by the noun phrase, and says that the entity is <b>uniquely</b> mutually <b>identifiable</b> in context by the speaker and hearer by virtue of that descripiton. This characterization splits into six different cases. The indefinite determiner “a ” and the bare plural (the empty string of the title) conveys just the opposite. It says the entity referred to by the noun phrase is not mutually identifiable in context by the description provided by the noun phrase. This could result either from the property described being unknown or from the entity referred to being unknown. Each of these possibilities breaks into several subcases. Several hundred examples of definite and indefinite noun phrases in a diverse corpus are analyzed from this perspective. ...|$|R
40|$|Continuously {{monitoring}} the link performance {{is important to}} network diagnosis. Recently, active probes sent between end systems are widely used to monitor the link performance. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} minimizing the probing cost and achieving identifiability in link monitoring. Given a set of links to monitor, our objective is to select as few probing paths as possible to cover all of them, and the selected probing paths can <b>uniquely</b> identify all <b>identifiable</b> links being monitored. We propose an algorithm based on the linear system model to find out all sets of probing paths that can <b>uniquely</b> identify an <b>identifiable</b> link. We extend the bipartite model to reflect the relation between a set of probing paths and the link that can be uniquely identified. Through the extended bipartite model, our optimization problem is transformed into the classic set cover problem, which is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose a heuristic based algorithm to greedily select the probing paths. Our method eliminates two types of redundant probing paths, i. e., those that can be replaced by others and those that cannot be used to achieving identifiability. Simulations based on real network topologies show that our approach can achieve identifiability with very low probing cost. Compared with prior work, our method is more general and has better performance. 1...|$|R

2500|$|A neuron {{is called}} {{identified}} {{if it has}} properties that distinguish it from every other neuron in the same animal—properties such as location, neurotransmitter, gene expression pattern, and connectivity—and if every individual organism belonging to the same species has one and only one neuron with {{the same set of}} properties. [...] In vertebrate nervous systems very few neurons are [...] "identified" [...] in this sense—in humans, there are believed to be none—but in simpler nervous systems, some or all neurons may be thus unique. [...] In the roundworm C. elegans, whose nervous system is the most thoroughly described of any animal's, every neuron in the body is <b>uniquely</b> <b>identifiable,</b> with the same location and the same connections in every individual worm. [...] One notable consequence of this fact is that the form of the C. elegans nervous system is completely specified by the genome, with no experience-dependent plasticity.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} multi-cell {{model for}} the in vitro kinetics of the anti-cancer agent topotecan (TPT) following administration into a culture medium containing a population of human breast cancer cells (MCF- 7 cell line) is described. This non-linear compartmental model {{is an extension of}} an earlier single-cell type model and has been validated using experimental data obtained using two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM). A structural identifiability analysis is performed prior to parameter estimation to test whether the unknown parameters within the model are uniquely determined by the model outputs. The full model has 43 compartments, with 107 unknown parameters, and {{it was found that the}} structural identifiability result could not be established even when using the latest version of the symbolic computation software MATHEMATICA. However, by assuming that a priori knowledge is available for certain parameters, it was possible to reduce the number of parameters to 81, and it was found that this (Stage Two) model was globally (<b>uniquely)</b> structurally <b>identifiable.</b> The identifiability analysis demonstrated how valuable symbolic computation is in this context, as the analysis is far too lengthy and difficult to be performed by hand.

40|$|Ordinary {{differential}} equation models in biology often contain {{a large number}} of parameters that must be determined from measurements by parameter estimation. For a parameter estimation procedure to be successful, there must be a unique set of parameters that can have produced the measured data. This is not the case if a model is not <b>uniquely</b> structurally <b>identifiable</b> with the given set of outputs selected as measurements. In designing an experiment for the purpose of parameter estimation, given a set of feasible but resource-consuming measurements, it is useful to know which ones must be included in order to obtain an identifiable system, or whether the system is unidentifiable from the feasible measurement set. We have developed an algorithm that, from a user-provided set of variables and parameters or functions of them assumed to be measurable or known, determines all subsets that when used as outputs give a locally structurally identifiable system and are such that any output set for which the system is structurally identifiable must contain {{at least one of the}} calculated subsets. The algorithm has been implemented in Mathematica and shown to be feasible and efficient. We have successfully applied it in the analysis of large signalling pathway models from the literature...|$|R
40|$|Internet of Things (IoT) is a {{pervasive}} environment to interconnect the things like: smart objects, devices etc. in a structure like internet. Things can be interconnected in IoT {{if these are}} <b>uniquely</b> addressable and <b>identifiable.</b> Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is one the important radio frequency based addressing scheme in IoT. Major security challenge in resource constraint RFID networks is how to achieve traditional CIA security i. e. Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication. Computational and communication costs for Lightweight Mutual Authentication Protocol (LMAP), RFID mutual Authentication Protocol with Permutation (RAPP) and kazahaya authentication protocols are analyzed. These authentication protocols are modeled to analyze the delays using lightweight modeling language. Delay analysis is performed using alloy model over LMAP, RAPP and kazahaya authentication protocols where one datacenter (DC) is connected to different number of readers (1, 5 or 10) with connectivity to 1, 5 or 25 tags associated with reader and its results show that for LMAP delay varies from 30 - 156 msec, for RAPP from 31 - 188 while for kazahaya from 61 - 374 msec. Further, performance of RFID authentication protocols is analyzed for group construction through more than one DC (1, 5 or 10) with different number of readers (10, 50 or 100) and tags associated with these readers (50, 500, 1000) and results show that DC based binary tree topology with LMAP authentication protocol is having a minimum delay for 50 or 100 readers. Other authentication protocols fail to give authentication results because of large delays in the network. Thus, RAPP and Kazahaya are not suitable for scenarios where there is large amount of increase in number of tags or readers...|$|R
