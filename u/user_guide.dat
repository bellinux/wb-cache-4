2500|$|At {{times there}} has been {{disagreement}} about which mapping Illumina actually uses. The <b>user</b> <b>guide</b> (Appendix B, page 122) for version 1.4 of the Illumina pipeline states that: [...] "The scores are defined as Q=10*log10(p/(1-p)) , where p is {{the probability of a}} base call corresponding to the base in question". In retrospect, this entry in the manual appears to have been an error. The <b>user</b> <b>guide</b> (What's New, page 5) for version 1.5 of the Illumina pipeline lists this description instead: [...] "Important Changes in Pipeline v1.3 [...] The quality scoring scheme has changed to the Phred [...] scoring scheme, encoded as an ASCII character by adding 64 to the Phred value. A Phred score of a base is: , where e is the estimated probability of a base being wrong.|$|E

2500|$|The Madeline {{video games}} feature several methods for the player to track {{progress}} through the educational material. Madeline serves as an in-game helper, providing encouragement and hints [...] supporting the learning process through immediate, positive reinforcement from the game to the player. The Orlando Sentinel explains, [...] "the effervescent Madeline is there to offer frequent encouragement and reward correct answers." [...] In addition, the games incorporate a Progress Tracker to keep parents and educators informed of the player's ongoing performance. The Progress Tracker highlights the activities {{in which they are}} excelling or may need some assistance. The game also has a feature which recognizes skill mastery and increases difficulty automatically. Level adjustment is a mechanic used in certain games, however, variable levels of difficulty are not present in all of the games. Some of the games, such as Madeline European Adventures, come with a <b>user</b> <b>guide</b> with hints and a walkthrough to help a player who is stuck, or to allow a parent to quickly learn the gameplay in order to help a young player. Several of the installments allow the player to track his or her progress through printable materials, such as [...] "printable cards, postcards, and games that you can play away from the computer." ...|$|E

For example, the Server Editions' capability of running two or more Scripts scheduled for the same time on the same [...] "backup server" [...] simultaneously is not discussed in the Retrospect Macintosh User's Guide—either the method of specifying different [...] "activity threads" [...] for the Scripts or the source-destination conflict analysis of all Scripts that are scheduled to run at the same time. For another example, the sequence in which Sources are processed by Scripts—both the default and the method of changing it, mentioned in the [...] "Retrospect Macintosh 8" [...] section above, is not discussed in the Retrospect Macintosh <b>User's</b> <b>Guide.</b> For a third example, the only mention of WebDAV shares in the Retrospect Windows <b>User's</b> <b>Guides</b> for v9 and above is a Release Note for Retrospect Windows 8 that refers to an incorrect page number—but gives an apparently-important requirement for the UNC path. [...] However the equivalent WebDAV mention in the [...] "What's New" [...] chapter in the Retrospect Macintosh 9 <b>User's</b> <b>Guide</b> Addendum did make its way to a paragraph in another chapter of later versions of the Macintosh <b>User's</b> <b>Guide.</b>|$|R
