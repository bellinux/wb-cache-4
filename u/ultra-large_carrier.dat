40|$|The {{magnetoresistance}} is {{the magnetic}} field induced change of electrical resistivity of a material. Recent studies have revealed extremely large magnetoresistance in several non-magnetic semimetals, which has been explained {{on the basis of}} either electron-hole compensation or the Fermi surface topology, or the combination of both. Here, we present a single crystal study on MoSi$_ 2 $, which exhibits extremely large magnetoresistance, approaching almost 10 $^ 7 $ % at 2 K and 14 T magnetic field. It is found that the electron-hole compensation level in MoSi$_ 2 $ evolves with magnetic field, which is resulted from strong Zeeman effect, and found beneficial in boosting the large non-saturating magnetoresistance. The non-trivial Berry phase in the de Haas-van Alphen oscillations and the moderate suppression of backward scattering of the charge carriers lend support for the topological nature of this semimetal. The <b>ultra-large</b> <b>carrier</b> mobility of the topologically protected charge carriers reinforces the magnetoresistance of MoSi 2 to an unprecedented large value.

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{favorable}} size, Aframax tankers can serve most ports in the world. These vessels serve regions {{that do not}} have very large ports or offshore oil terminals to accommodate very large crude <b>carriers</b> and <b>ultra-large</b> crude <b>carriers.</b> Aframax tankers are optimal for short- to medium-haul crude oil transportation. Aframax class tankers are largely used in the basins of the Black Sea, the North Sea, the Caribbean Sea, the South and East China Seas, and the Mediterranean. Non-OPEC exporting countries may require the use of tankers because the harbors and canals through which these countries export their oil are too small to accommodate the larger Suezmax or the larger still very large crude <b>carriers</b> and <b>ultra-large</b> crude <b>carriers.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{global economic}} needs are driving the {{designs for the}} next generation of ocean going vessels. Current <b>ultra-large</b> container <b>carrier</b> (10, 000 TEU plus) designs are considerably larger and more complex than any currently in service. Proper and rational classification assessment requires that first principles based direct calculation methods be used to augment the standard classification review. The design philosophy behind the ABS Dynamic Loading Approach enables comprehensive identification of potential failure mechanisms. The scope of the necessary engineering assessment encompass full-ship finite element analysis under non-linear sea loads, spectral fatigue analysis, finite element lashing analysis, free and forced vibration analysis, and transient and impact load analysis. This paper describes key aspects of the DLA design philosophy such as non-linear sea loads, load combinations, various applications derived from full-ship finite element analysis. Several examples are given to highlight some critical failure mechanisms to be considered for <b>ultra-large</b> container <b>carriers.</b> KEY WORDS: full-ship finite element analysis; load combinations; non-linear dynamic sea loads; ultra-large container carriers; vibration analysi...|$|R

40|$|Large {{and long}} ships {{experience}} springing behavior. Depending {{on the trade}} routes and design of such ocean-going ships, wave-induced vibrations {{may be due to}} springing and whipping effects. In this paper, we address the wave-induced vibrations in an <b>ultra-large</b> ore <b>carrier</b> under fully loaded and ballast conditions. The experimental measurements from tests performed using a flexible model of the ship were compared with the numerical predictions from 3 -D hydro-elastic theory (THAFTS) (Wu, Hydroelasticity of floating bodies. PH. D thesis, Brunel University, 1984). The measurements showed multiple frequencies between the encountered wave frequency and the 2 -node bending frequency that occurred only in ballast conditions, whereas the springing vibrations were more apparent with forward speed under ballast conditions in both regular and irregular waves. The numerical method predicted the vertical bending moment quite well in the fully loaded condition but underestimated it in the ballast condition. This result was primarily due to an inability to capture the prediction of the multiple frequencies between the encountered wave frequency and the 2 -node bending frequency. Using THAFTS, a new ship form with a deep draft was introduced, and this vessel was shown to reduce springing vibrations...|$|R
