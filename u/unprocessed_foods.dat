25|$|Alkaline diet (also {{known as}} the {{alkaline}} ash diet, alkaline acid diet, acid ash diet, and acid alkaline diet) describes a group of loosely related diets based on the misconception that different types of food can {{have an effect on}} the pH balance of the body. It originated from theories related to osteoporosis research, however, most proponents of the diet maintain the incorrect belief that certain foods can affect the acidity (pH) of the body and can therefore be used to treat or prevent disease. Due to the lack of credible evidence supporting the claimed mechanism of this diet, it is not recommended by dietitians or other health professionals, though some have noted that eating <b>unprocessed</b> <b>foods</b> as this diet recommends may have incidental health benefits unrelated to bodily pH.|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} with food law liability for defective product {{is essential to}} seek damages, {{in the case of}} damage caused by the food. In the article the author presents several issues concerning liability for defective food product. Food is characterized by the fact that inappropriate transport or storage conditions may cause the food becomes unsafe at each stage of the food chain. This means that the producer relatively easy may release himself from liability. At the same time, under this regime of liability, any other operator of the food chain is not responsible in that case. Additionally, it is provided for ten year limitation period, starting from the product launch, independent of the point where damage occurs. Moreover, the situation of agricultural producer is unfavorable. Very often it is impossible to detect the dangerous qualities of the <b>unprocessed</b> <b>food.</b> In addition, <b>unprocessed</b> <b>food</b> becomes dangerous due to the circumstances in which the farmer has no impact (e. g. pollution). The author concludes that the legislator, establishing rules for product liability, has not taken into account the specific features of food product. As the result of the above the protection of the consumer {{on the basis of this}} regime of liability is not sufficient but on the other hand the liability of farmer is too strict.

To reach this goal we estimate a simple three-equation model for the short term forecasting of twelve-month percentage variations of the Italian consumer price index. The starting point of the model is the decomposition of the general index in a main component, the so-called core inflation, capturing longer term tendencies and two additional volatile components, those of <b>unprocessed</b> <b>food</b> and energy prices. The idea is that it is exactly core inflation which is possible to explain and forecast with a set of basic economic variables acting as leading indicators. ...|$|R

Although the human genome has remained primarily un-changed since the agricultural revolution 10, 000 years ago, our diet and lifestyle have become progressively more di-vergent from those of our ancient ancestors. Accumulating evidence suggests that this mismatch between our modern diet and lifestyle and our Paleolithic genome is playing a substantial role in the ongoing epidemics of obesity, hyper-tension, diabetes, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular dis-ease. Until 500 generations ago, all humans consumed only wild and <b>unprocessed</b> <b>food</b> foraged and hunted from their environment.

It turns out that, according to usual statistical criteria, the combination of several indicators -in particular those derived from surveys- provides better results than dynamic factor models, even after pre-selection of the variables included in the panel. However, factors included in VAR models exhibit more stable forecasting performance over time. Results for HICP excluding <b>unprocessed</b> <b>food</b> and energy are very encouraging.
