Beside wellknown layered silicate fillers, recent attention is attracted to layered double hydroxide fillers (LDH), mainly of synthetic origin. The structure of LDH is based on brucite, or magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH) 2 and is illustrated in Fig. 2. The modification of LDHs is commonly done by organic anions, to increase the original interlayer distance and to improve the organophilicity of the filler, keeping in mind their final application as fillers for, usually hydrophobic, polymer matrices. We have used the modified rehydration procedure for preparing organically modified LDH. The stoichiometric quantities of Ca 3 3 Al 2 O 6, CaO and benzoic (B) (or <b>undecenoic</b> (U)) <b>acid</b> were mixed with water and some acetone. After long and vigorous shaking, the precipitated fillers were washed, dried and characterized. X-ray diffraction method (XRD) has shown the increase of the original interlayer distance for unmodified LDH (OH–-saturated) of 0. 76 nm to the 1. 6 nm in LDH-B or LDH-U fillers (Fig. 3). Infrared spectroscopy method (FTIR) has confirmed the incorporation of benzoic anion within the filler layers (Fig. 4). For the preparation of LDH-B and LDH-U composites with polystyrene (PS), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and copolymer (SMMA) matrices, a two-step in situ bulk radical polymerization was selected (Table 1 for recipes, azobisisobutyronitrile as initiator), using conventional stirred tank reactor in the first step, and heated mold with the movable wall (Fig. 6) in the second step of polymerization. All the prepared composites with LDH-U fillers were macroscopically phase-separated, as was the PMMA/LDH-B composite. PS/LDH-B and SMMA/LDH-B samples {{were found to be}} transparent and were further examined for deduction of their structure (Fig. 5) and thermal properties. FTIR measurements showed that there is some filler present in the nanocomposites (Fig. 7). XRD measurements pointed to the disturbance of the characteristic layered structure of the filler in the obtained composites (Fig. 8). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that the filler was not homogeneously dispersed within the matrix (Fig. 9). However, the dispersion was quite good, and a high degree of exfoliation was obtained for PS/LDH-B composites (Fig. 10); the predominantly intercalated structure was found for SMMA/LDH-B composites (Fig. 11). Thus, in both cases nanocomposites were prepared. The thermal characterization by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed the increase of glass transition point of 10 °C for PS/LDH-B nanocomposite with intermediate (w = 2. 5 or 5. 0 %) filler content (in comparison with neat PS), a feature that is characteristic for exfoliated nanocomposites. No such increase was obtained for SMMA/LDH-B nanocomposites. The thermal degradation in the inert nitrogen atmosphere was studied by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) method. The improvement of thermal stability of PS/LDH-B in comparison with neat PS was found only for the nanocomposites with intermediate (w = 2. 5 or 5. 0 %) filler content (Fig. 12), again proving the exfoliated structure. The half-weight loss temperature of SMMA/LDH-B nanocomposites continuously increases with the increase of filler content (Fig. 13), a feature that is characteristic for intercalated nanocomposites. In conclusion, the described methods were found satisfactory for preparing the exfoliated nanocomposites of LDH-B and PS. New organic modifiers are to be sought, if exfoliated nanocomposites of SMMA and PMMA matrices are to be prepared.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} and synthesise {{the evidence for}} efficacy and cost effectiveness of topical treatments for superficial fungal infections of the skin and nails of the feet. DESIGN: Systematic review. INTERVENTIONS: Topical treatments for superficial fungal infections. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cure confirmed by culture and microscopy for skin and by culture for nails in patients with clinically diagnosed fungal infections. RESULTS: Of 126 trials identified in 121 papers, 72 (57. 1 %) met the inclusion criteria. Placebo controlled trials yielded pooled relative risks of failure to cure skin infections: allylamines (0. 30, 95 % confidence interval 0. 24 to 0. 38); azoles (0. 54, 0. 42 to 0. 68); <b>undecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (0. 28, 0. 11 to 0. 74); and tolnaftate (0. 46, 0. 17 to 1. 22). Although meta-analysis of 11 trials comparing allylamines and azoles showed a relative risk of failure to cure of 0. 88 (0. 78 to 0. 99) in favour of allylamines, there was evidence of language bias. Seven reports in English favoured allylamines (0. 79, 0. 69 to 0. 91), but four reports in foreign languages showed {{no difference between the}} two drugs (1. 01, 0. 90 to 1. 13). Neither trial of nail infections showed significant differences between alternative topical treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Allylamines, azoles, and <b>undecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> were efficacious in placebo controlled trials. There are sufficient comparative trials to judge relative efficacy only between allylamines and azoles. Allylamines cure slightly more infections than azoles but are much more expensive than azoles. The most cost effective strategy is first to treat with azoles or <b>undecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> and to use allylamines only if that fails...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{regenerative}} medicine, stem cell-based therapy {{often requires}} a scaffold to deliver cells and/or growth factors to the injured site. Porous silicon (pSi) is a promising biomaterial for tissue engineering {{as it is}} both non-toxic and bioresorbable. Moreover, surface modification can offer control over the degradation rate of pSi and can also promote cell adhesion. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) are pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells found within the teeth and constitute a readily source of stem cells. Thus, coupling the good proliferation and differentiation capacities of DPSC with the textural and chemical properties of the pSi substrates provides an interesting approach for therapeutic use. In this study, the behavior of human DPSC is analyzed on pSi substrates presenting pore of various sizes, 10 ± 2 nm, 36 ± 4 nm and 1. 0 ± 0. 1 μm, and undergoing different chemical treatments: thermal oxidation, silanization with aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), and hydrosilylation with <b>undecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> or semicarbazide.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was the development of stable dispersions for aqueous polyketone latices {{on the basis of}} the copolymers propene/undecenoic acid/CO, butene/undecenoic acid/CO, and propene/butene/undecenoic acid/CO. Therefore, attention has been focused on the design of new water-soluble palladium(II) catalysts for the production of stable polymer latices with (i) high solids contents, (ii) high molecular weights, (iii) particle sizes in the range between 50 and 500 nm, and (iv) glass transition temperatures with values below room temperature. In the first chapter of this thesis the synthesis and characterization of novel diphosphine ligands and their palladium(II) complexes is described. The diphosphines R 2 P(CH 2) 3 PR 2 [R = (CH 2) nP(O) (OEt) 2, n = 2 - 6, 8; (CH 2) nOH, n = 6; (CH 2) nNH 2, n = 3] were obtained by heating P(OEt) 3 with 1, 3 -dibromopropane according to a Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction, followed by reduction of the resulting diphosphate with LiAlH 4 in diethyl ether to give H 2 P(CH 2) 3 PH 2. An excess of the corresponding olefin CH 2 =CH. (CH 2) n. X (X = OH, n = 4; P(O) (OEt) 2, n = 0 - 4, 6; NH 2, n = 1) was photochemically hydrophosphinated with the diprimary phosphine H 2 P(CH 2) 3 PH 2 over night. This convenient synthesis is nearly quantitative and simplifies the purification of the products. Purification is achieved by removing excess alkene under reduced pressure. The alkenyl phosphonates CH 2 =CH. (CH 2) n. P(O) (OEt) 2 were obtained either from commercial suppliers (n = 0, 1) or prepared by literature methods (n = 2. 4, 6). All diphosphines resulted as colorless, air-sensitive, and oily products. They are soluble in water and chlorinated hydrocarbons like dichloromethane and chloroform. Upon reaction of palladium(II) acetate with these hydroxyalkyl, phosphonate and aminophosphine ligands in a 1 : 1 mixture of dichloromethane and acetonitrile at room temperature the corresponding diacetatodiphosphinepalladium(II) complexes (R 2 P(CH 2) 3 PR 2) Pd(OAc) 2 [R = (CH 2) nP(O) (OEt) 2, n = 2 - 6, 8; (CH 2) nOH, n = 6; (CH 2) nNH 2, n = 3] could be isolated. They are soluble in water, alcohols, and in organic solvents of medium polarity and offer an easy way to generate catalytically active precursor species in one step by addition of excess Brønsted acid to a solution in water. The structure of the complex (R 2 P(CH 2) 3 PR 2) Pd(OAc) 2 [R = (CH 2) 6 OH] additionally was investigated by an X-ray structural analysis. All diphosphine ligands and their palladium(II) complexes were characterized by means of MS, IR, and NMR spectroscopy. The 31 P{ 1 H}-NMR spectra of the phosphonate ligand R 2 P(CH 2) 3 PR 2 [R = (CH 2) 2 P(O) (OEt) 2] and its palladium(II) complex (R 2 P(CH 2) 3 PR 2) Pd(OAc) 2 [R = (CH 2) 2 P(O) (OEt) 2] display two signals in a 2 : 1 ratio, assigned to the phosphonate and phosphine substituents. A marked shift and significant change of the multiplicity in the 31 P{ 1 H}-NMR spectra for the phosphine group in this ligand from a triplet (&# 948; = - 22) to a multiplet at &# 948; = 22 upon reaction of palladium(II) acetate with R 2 P(CH 2) 3 PR 2 [R = (CH 2) 2 P(O) (OEt) 2] have been observed. The second part of this thesis is devoted to the catalytic activity of these palladium(II) complexes for the copolymerization of &# 945;-olefins with carbon monoxide. Indeed the diacetatodiphosphinepalldium(II) complexes (R 2 P(CH 2) 3 PR 2) Pd(OAc) 2 proved to be highly active catalysts for the co- and terpolymerization of several &# 945;-olefins with carbon monoxide in the presence of excess HBF 4. Latices of aliphatic polyketones (propene/undecenoic acid/CO, butene/undecenoic acid/CO, and propene/butene/undecenoic acid/CO copolymers) prepared by a transition metal catalyzed polymerization are described for the first time. These aqueous polyketone latices exhibit high solids contents of up to 23 % and high molecular weights of up to 6. 3. 104 g mol- 1 at narrow polydispersities (Mw/Mn. 2). Also they are produced at rates similar to the commercially process performed in methanol. Stable dispersions are obtained by the introduction of <b>undecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> as a third or fourth comonomer and no phase separation, or the formation of a coagulum within ten weeks were observed. In these latices, hydrophilic carboxylic acid moieties covalently bound to the particle surface contribute to stabilization. In addition, for practical applications it is desirable to find routes to set the Tg values significantly below room temperature. The introduction of 5. 10 % (wt/wt) of <b>undecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> to the olefin during the polymerization process indeed resulted in markedly decreased Tg values from room temperature to. 2 °C. With glass transitions being below room temperature, &# 945;-olefin/CO copolymers are well suited for the formation of films. In contrast to elastic materials obtained with (dppp) Pd, complexes (R 2 P(CH 2) 3 PR 2) Pd(OAc) 2 produce non-elastic thermoplastics. The &# 945;-olefin/CO copolymer latices exhibit particle sizes between 60 and 224 nm, which are in the desirable range for latex applications. The co- and terpolymerization of hydrophobic monomers in the emulsion polymerization in the presence of methyl-&# 946;-cyclodextrin (W 7 M 1. 8) as a phase transfer agent enables the production of higher solids contents of the polyketones and a higher productivity of the catalysts. Water-insoluble molecules become water-soluble by treatment with aqueous solutions of cyclodextrins. The 13 C{ 1 H}-NMR spectra (in CDCl 3) of the propene/CO, butene/CO, and propene/butene/CO copolymers, respectively, show only a single peak for the carbonyl group and this gives an indication that perfectly head-to-tail regioregular polyketones have been formed. Complexes (R 2 P(CH 2) 3 PR 2) Pd(OAc) 2 [R = (CH 2) nP(O) (OEt) 2; n = 6, 3] are highly active catalysts in the copolymerization of butene/undecenoic acid/CO, propene/butene/undecenoic acid/CO, and propene/undecenoic acid/CO, respectively, with productivities of up to 1. 0. 104 (mol(substr) mol(Pd). 1). Generally the molecular weight of &# 945;-olefin/CO copolymers increase significantly as the chain length of the monomers decreases. Depending on the chain-length of the phosphorus attached substituents in the palladium catalysts (R 2 P(CH 2) 3 PR 2) Pd(OAc) 2, four variables for the propene/CO, butene/CO, and propene/butene/CO copolymers can be controlled: (i) the regioregularity, (ii) the molecular weight, (iii) the glass transition temperature, and the melting point (Tg and Tm). This indicates clearly that the steric properties of the catalyst control the molecular weights and the microstructure (e. g. the regioregularity) of the copolymers. The conformational flexibility of the four P-bonded hydroxyalkyl, phosphonate, or amine substituents combined with their steric demand and amphiphilic character generate a kind of hydrophobic catalytic pocket in the environment of the metal center in which aliphatic substrate molecules and the growing polymer chain nicely fit. Die Zielsetzung dieser Arbeit war die Entwicklung stabiler Dispersionen für wäßrige Polyketon-Latices auf der Basis von Copolymeren aus Propen/Undecensäure/CO, Buten/Undecensäure/CO und Propen/Buten/Undecensäure/CO. Deshalb wurde die Aufmerksamkeit auf das Design der neuen wasserlöslichen Palladium(II) -Katalysatoren gerichtet, um stabile Polymer Latices mit (i) hohem Feststoffgehalt, (ii) hohen Molekulargewichten, (iii) Teilchengrößen im Bereich zwischen 50 und 500 nm und (iv) Glasübergangstemperaturen mit Werten unterhalb der Raumtemperatur zu erhalten. Drei Arten von Palladiumkomplexen mit Hydroxyalkyl-, Phosphonat- und Aminsubstituenten, an die Phosphordonoren angebunden wurden, wurden in der Emulsionskopolymerisation von Propen/CO, von Buten/CO und von Propen/Buten/CO eingesetzt. Abhängig von der Kettenlänge der am Phosphor angebrachten Substituenten der Katalysatoren, wurden vier Variablen für die Propen/CO, Buten/CO und Propen/Buten/CO Copolymere überprüft: (i) die Regioregularität; (ii) das Molekulargewicht (iii) die Glasübergangstemperatur und (iv) der Schmelzpunkt (Tg und Tm). Beständige Dispersionen werden durch Zugabe von Undecensäure als drittes oder viertes Monomeres in die Propen/CO, in Buten/CO und in Propen/Buten/CO Copolymere erreicht. Es wurde innerhalb von 10 Wochen keine Phasentrennung oder Bildung von Koagulaten beobachtet. In diesen Latices tragen die hydrophilen Carboxylsäure Anteile, die kovalent an die Partikeloberfläche gebunden sind, zur Stabilisierung bei. Mit Phasentransfer-Reagenzien, z. B. Methyl-b-Cyclodextrin (W 7 M 1, 8), konnten bei der Co- und Terpolymerisation von hydrophoben Monomeren in der Emulsionspolymerisation bessere Resultate erzielt werden. Ein höherer Feststoffgehalt der Polyketone und eine höhere Produktivität der Katalysatoren wurden beobachtet...|$|E
