6000|$|In one of {{the tombs}} {{there is a little}} chamber whose ceiling, {{probably}} because of a fault in the rock, could not be smoothed off like the others. So the decorator, very cunningly, covered it with a closely designed cloth-pattern--just such a chintz-like piece of stuff as, in real life, one would use to <b>underhang</b> a rough roof with. He did it perfectly, down there in the dark, and went his way. Thousands of years later, there was born a man of my acquaintance who, for good and sufficient reason, had an almost insane horror of anything in the nature of a ceiling-cloth. He used to make excuses for not going into the dry goods shops at Christmas, when hastily enlarged annexes are hidden, roof and sides, with embroideries. Perhaps a snake or a lizard had dropped on his mother from the roof before he was born; perhaps it was the memory of some hideous fever-bout in a tent. At any rate, that man's idea of The Torment was a hot, crowded underground room, underhung with patterned cloths. Once in his life at a city in the far north, where he had to make a speech, he met that perfect combination. They led him up and down narrow, crowded, steam-heated passages, till they planted him at last in a room without visible windows (by which he knew he was, underground), and directly beneath a warm-patterned ceiling-cloth--rather like a tent-lining. And there he had to say his say, while panic terror sat in his throat. The second time was in the Valley of the Kings, where very similar passages, crowded with people, led him into a room cut of rock, fathoms underground, with what looked like a sagging chintz cloth not three feet above his head. The man I'd like to catch,' he said when he came outside again, 'is that decorator-man. D'you suppose he meant to produce that effect?' ...|$|E
50|$|Under party-list {{proportional}} representation systems, parties receive {{a number of}} seats {{in proportion to the}} number of votes they received. If a party does not have enough people to fill its vacancies, there is an <b>underhang.</b> For example, if a party wins enough votes for ten seats, but only have seven people nominated on its list, then there is an <b>underhang</b> of three seats.|$|E
50|$|In {{proportional}} representation (PR) electoral systems, an <b>underhang</b> seat is a seat {{to which a}} party is entitled {{by virtue of the}} share of the votes it has received but is unable to fill through having submitted too few candidates.|$|E
50|$|Another way {{of dealing}} with <b>underhangs</b> is to allow the party to {{nominate}} people to become MPs.|$|R
50|$|Criticism of the FPP system {{began in}} the 1950s and {{intensified}} after Labour lost the 1978 and 1981 elections despite having more overall votes than National. An indicative (non-binding) referendum to change the voting system was held in 1992, {{which led to a}} binding referendum during the 1993 election. As a result, New Zealand has used the mixed-member proportional (MMP) system since 1996. Under MMP, each Member of Parliament is either elected by voters in a single-member constituency via FPP or appointed from party lists. Officially, the New Zealand parliament has 120 seats, however this sometimes differs due to overhangs and <b>underhangs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{outline of}} Peñalara is rounded, {{displaying}} few <b>underhangs.</b> The hillsides of this mountain {{are covered with}} different types of vegetation, depending on the elevation. Largely undisturbed oak tree groves are found at an elevation of 1,000 to 1,300 metres. From 1,100 metres to 2,000 metres, the slopes are dominated by wild pine forests. From 2,000 metres up to the summit, the vegetation consists of more sparsely distributed, low-lying bushes particular to high elevations. The animal habitation of the mountain {{is made up of}} small mammals, a large variety of insects and various bird species such as eagles and vultures.|$|R
5000|$|In the Scottish Parliament an <b>underhang</b> {{seat was}} caused by the death of Margo MacDonald in 2014. As she was elected as a {{regional}} list MSP as an independent (effectively the sole candidate of [...] "the Margo party") her seat was left vacant until the next election.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, {{along with}} the {{introduction}} of the [...] "hexhead", BMW inverted the Paralever and moved the torque arm from the bottom {{to the top of the}} drive shaft housing (photo right). This reduces <b>underhang</b> of components and tends to increase ground clearance in right lean.|$|E
50|$|The stadium has a {{large number}} of obstructed-view seats. In some cases, the view is cut off by an {{overhang}} or <b>underhang,</b> and others are {{directly in front of the}} foul or support poles. Also, the design of the upper deck leaves it one of the highest in baseball. The view from the grandstand reserved sections in left is particularly obstructed.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the occlusal marginal integrity after 3. 5 {{years of a}} packable and a conventional resin-based composite placed using a simplified resin bonding system to restore Class I and II preparations permanent teeth. Methods: Epoxy resin replicas obtained from polyvinyl siloxane impressions were examined with a scanning electron microscope. Photographs (70 x magnification) of the least satisfactory sections of the occlusal margins of the restorations were ranked into four groups from best to worst. Defects comprised marginal gaps, fractures, overhangs and <b>underhangs</b> of composite material. Results: The marginal quality of the 18 conventional SpectrumTPH (Dentsply DeTrey GmbH, Konstanz, Germany) restorations was significantly better {{than that of the}} 17 packable SureFil (Dentsply DeTrey) restorations (Mann-Whitney U = 71. 5, P = 0. 01). The SpectrumTPH defects were usually less than 10 µm. Marginal defects ranged up to 170 µm. Conclusions: After 3. 5 years, the occlusal marginal integrity of a hybrid resin composite was statistically, significantly better than that of a packable resin composite placed using a simplified adhesive system in Class I and II preparations (P = 0. 01) ...|$|R
50|$|Each hole {{contains}} a specially formed t-nut to allow modular climbing holds to be screwed onto the wall. With manufactured steel or aluminum walls, an engineered industrial fastener {{is used to}} secure climbing holds. The face of the multiplex board climbing surface is covered with textured products including concrete and paint or polyurethane loaded with sand. In addition to the textured surface and hand holds, the wall may contain surface structures such as indentions (incuts) and protrusions (bulges), or {{take the form of}} an overhang, <b>underhang</b> or crack.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{way that}} mixed member {{proportional}} representation works, had the party crossed the minimum 5% threshold required {{to be admitted to}} parliament without an electorate seat, the total number of MPs would have been reduced by about four (an [...] "underhang"). This is because 5% of the vote would entitle it to approximately six MPs but it had only two candidates (Bill and Ben) on its party list. However, the <b>underhang</b> would have partially been cancelled out by the Maori Party's overhang, having won five electorate seats when entitled to only three by the party vote.|$|E
50|$|Parties with underhangs {{usually are}} not {{entitled}} to retroactively add to their list, and lose the potential seats represented by the <b>underhang.</b> For instance, if New Zealand's 99 MP Party (whose stated manifesto {{is to reduce the}} size of parliament) had received five percent of the vote in the 2005 New Zealand general election, they would have been entitled to six seats within the 120 seat House of Representatives. But as they had just two people on their list, they would have filled only two seats. The House would thus have shrunk by four MPs. Since the party received only 0.03% of the vote, this eventuality was avoided.|$|E
5000|$|... "We believe that, if you're an artist, {{you need}} to have every color in your palette. The Corrs could do anything. In smaller arenas, they could use a couple of hangs of MILO and, if there were bleachers, they could use the M2Ds. If there weren't bleachers, M2Ds could <b>underhang</b> below the MILOs. If they needed to throw a farther distance, they could use the M3Ds. MSL-4s and M2Ds were used for infill, for those little areas that you find in European venues. In Europe, the venues are strangely shaped. You go to the Festhalle in Stuttgart and it's the most ridiculous shape! That's why we {{supplied}} every color in the palette. The main thing is, the Corrs could go into any venue and they do whatever they wanted to do. It's so evenly dispersed between the different box types that it still sounded fantastic and smooth as you walk between them. It sounded lovely all the way".|$|E

40|$|As {{implants}} {{are made}} in incremental sizes and usually do not fit perfectly, surgeons have to decide if it is preferable to over or undersize the components. This is particularly important for unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) tibial components, as overhang may cause irritation of soft tissues and pain, whereas <b>underhang</b> may cause loosening. One hundred and sixty Oxford UKRs were categorised according to whether they had minor (or= 3 mm, 9 %) tibial overhang, or tibial <b>underhang</b> (21 %). One year post surgery, {{there was no significant}} difference in outcome between the groups. Five years after surgery, those with major overhang had significantly worse Oxford Knee Scores (OKS) (p= 0. 001) and pain scores (p= 0. 001) than the others. The difference in scores was substantial (OKS= 10 points). There was no difference between the 'minor overhang' and the 'underhang' group. We conclude that surgeons must avoid tibial component overhang of 3 mm or more, as this severely compromises the outcome. Although this study showed no difference between minor overhang or <b>underhang,</b> we would advise against significant <b>underhang</b> because of the theoretical risk of component subsidence and loosening...|$|E
40|$|Unexplained pain is an {{important}} complication of both total knee replacement and unicompartmental knee replacement. After unicompartmental knee replacement the most common site for the pain is antero-medial over the proximal tibia. The {{reason for this is}} not clear; however it may be due to high bone strain. A validated finite element model of a proximal tibia implanted with a fully congruent unicompartmental knee replacement was used to investigate the effect that certain implantation parameters had on the surface strains of the tibia. The tibial tray was positioned neutrally, and also mal-aligned separately in the sagittal and coronal planes. Different amounts of tibial tray overhang and <b>underhang,</b> and different resection levels were modelled. All models were compared to an intact tibia and the strain on the exterior cortex compared for a peak load condition measured in-vivo during a step-up activity. Following implantation the bone strain in the proximal tibia increased by 40 %. There were no comparable increases in strain with different amounts of mal-alignment in the sagittal plane. There was a comparable increase in strain with a tibial tray overhang of 3 mm or greater, and excessive varus mal-alignment. This study has demonstrated that there is a large increase in strain, antero-medially on the proximal tibia, following implantation with a unicompartmental knee replacement. This may be the cause of antero-medial pain. As the bone remodels over time this strain will decrease, which probably explains why the pain usually settles within 12 months after surgery. However, certain errors in implantation result in strain values that might lead to degenerative remodelling and/or increased micro-damage of the bone; this may explain why the pain progressively worsens in some cases...|$|E
40|$|Background:. Anatomical {{variation}} {{may represent}} a challenge in achieving a close fit between a prosthesis and a patient’s osseous geometry in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The {{purposes of this study}} were to determine whether the shape of the distal part of the femur differs among ethnicities, whether these differences affect the fit of the femoral component of a standard prosthesis, and whether the additional availability of a femoral component with a reduced mediolateral dimension for the same anteroposterior dimension improves femoral component fit across ethnicities. Methods:. Femoral dimensions were measured intraoperatively during 967 TKAs performed using the same type of prosthesis in patients of 5 different ethnicities. Aspect ratios were calculated to determine whether the shapes of the femora differed among ethnicities. The component fit (“perfect,” overhang, or <b>underhang)</b> when only standard prostheses were available was compared with the fit when both standard and narrow prostheses were available in all ethnic groups. This enabled us to determine whether the femoral component fit was improved by the additional availability of the narrow version. Results:. Wide variations in shape were found among ethnicities as were variations among individuals of the same ethnicity. Differences in shape among ethnicities influenced the rate of overhang. However, overhang was more frequent at the trochlear than at the condylar level across all ethnicities. The availability of both the standard and the narrow femoral components improved the rate of a perfect fit in women in 3 of the 5 ethnic groups and reduced the overhang rate in women in all 5 of the ethnic groups. In contrast, only modest improvements in femoral component fit, which were not statistically significant, were seen in men. Conclusions:. The shape of the distal part of the femur varies not only among ethnicities but also within ethnic groups, leading to a high prevalence of overhang when only standard prostheses are available. The additional availability of a femoral component with a reduced mediolateral dimension for the same anteroposterior size can reduce overhang and improve component fit across ethnicities...|$|E
