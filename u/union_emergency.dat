40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the advantages a more integrated European emergency care and disaster management system {{would bring in}} this very divided field of work {{through the lens of}} emergency physicians and contributors with a specific focus on the example Romania has to offer in matters of legislation, financing, dispatch centres, education and training of professionals, pre- and in-hospital care and European cooperation mechanisms. At the same time, we share the belief that this desiderate of attaining a certain degree of homogeneity inside the European Union {{is more likely to be}} reached by following slightly different paths, according to national specifics of the countries. To sustain this theory, we will bring various examples in our study of such events that already happened and together concurred to prove the above mentioned ideas. We do believe that the dream of a Europe without borders transforms unfortunately into a nightmare when it comes to disasters, which definitely know no borders. Our response to their threat should be standing together in unity and acting in solidarity. Keywords: European <b>Union,</b> <b>emergency</b> care, disaster management, resiliency, cooperation Introduction The current paper aims to analyse a series of emergency and disaster medicine management systems and their congruency inside the European Union, while putting accent on the most worldwide renowned for their performances or simply for the principles that stay at their grounds and inspired other countries to found their own systems following the example they offered. At the same time, we will strike to bring up solid arguments in favour of our strong belief that, albeit the motto of the European Union In varietate concordia (English – United in Diversity) continues to inspire us and remains the symbol that should drive us further together, in terms of emergency and disaster medicine, the progress can only be achieved by building bridges of common knowledge, principles, laws and practice, while, of course, learning all the lessons which diversity has to offer. Therefore, unity should be the stronghold of this particular domain, with palpable results in the future in terms of successful interventions, lives saved and costs spared. * Lucian...|$|E

50|$|From {{the late}} 1920s to early 1930s, the military-political {{situation}} in the Soviet <b>Union</b> demanded <b>emergency</b> measures for the modernization of the army. The implementation of the 1929 program by the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) was designed to equip the armed forces with improved tanks. Most Red Army armor at the time consisted of relatively modern light infantry support tanks like the T-18 (MS-1), {{and the role of}} medium and heavy tanks was fulfilled mainly by British tanks that were captured in the Russian Civil War. Work began to create indigenous medium and heavy tanks, but it quickly became apparent that the USSR lacked the necessary scientific base and experience for tank design. After several unsuccessful attempts to develop an all-domestic tank design (such as the T-30), it was decided that the Army would attract professionals from abroad, primarily from Germany.|$|R

As part of the European <b>Union</b> (EU) <b>emergency</b> phytosanitary measures 2002 / 757 /EU and 2004 / 426 /EU all commercial rhododendron-growing premises are surveyed for P. ramorum. Detection of P. ramorum leads to quarantine measures, including destruction of plants, and could lead to considerable financial damage for the companies involved. Growers are taking all possible measures to avoid P. ramorum, including preventive fungicide treatments. However, because little information is available on the effect of the different oomycete fungicides on P. ramorum, there is a danger of conducting sub-optimal protective fungicide treatments. The objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of different oomycete fungicides against P. ramorum. Active ingredients from most of the oomycete fungicides on the Belgian market were screened for their in vitro effect on the mycelial growth of four P. ramorum isolates. Based on the results from the in vitro experiments, a selection of these fungicides was tested against P. ramorum on rhododendron plants.

To determine whether any patient characteristics (age, sex, race, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), arm circumference, ankle circumference, presenting complaint, and tobacco usage) influence the difference between ankle and arm NIBP measurements. Design: Prospective cross-sectional study Setting: Netcare <b>Union</b> Hospital <b>Emergency</b> Department (ED) Patients: All patients from 18 to 50 years of age presenting to the ED who were not in need of emergency medical treatment and who consented to participating in the study. Methods: Patients had their blood pressure measured whilst lying in the supine position. The blood pressure was measured on both arms and ankles with the correct size cuff according to manufacturer’s guidelines. All appropriate data was recorded. Main Results: The blood pressure measurements in the arm and ankle were compared. SBP measurement in the ankle was found to be inaccurate when compared to the arm and thus cannot be used as a substitute for arm SBP. Ankle DBP is the most accurate and deviates from the actual arm DBP within the clinically acceptable range of 10 mmHg. MAP difference is clinically acceptable on average, but the 95...|$|R
