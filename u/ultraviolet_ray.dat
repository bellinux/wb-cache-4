50|$|The King Edward VII Orthopaedic Hospital owed its {{existence}} to the fondness {{that the people}} of Sheffield had for King Edward VII who died in 1910. On his death a fund was set up and the population of the City raised £18,000 in his memory with the organisers expressing a desire that the money should be used to build a hospital school for crippled children. Sheffield City Council provided extra funds when it was found that £18,000 was not sufficient to build the hospital and the Duke of Norfolk presented the land in the Rivelin Valley on which it was to be built free of charge. Building work began in 1913 with the foundation stone being laid by the Duchess of Norfolk. W.A. Kenyon was the architect and despite delays caused by World War I the hospital opened early in 1916 and had around 120 beds along with the associated treatment rooms and operating theatre. The hospital was known as the King Edward VII Hospital for Crippled Children until 1948 and it treated patients with tuberculosis, rickets, congenital deformities and poliomyelitis. The hospital pioneered <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>ray</b> and vitamin treatment under the orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Creswell Lee Pattison.|$|E

40|$|In the {{previous}} papers, {{it was reported}} that the casing with cellophane, the irradiation by infrared and/or <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>ray</b> showed a marked prolongation of shelf-life of 2 ̆ 2 Kamaboko 2 ̆ 2. It was further noticed that when the preservatives were smeared on the surface, the combination of the preservatives and casing was rather inferior to the control group without casing. However, when the preservatives were mixed with the paste, the combination did not show any inferior effect to the control. The present paper deals with a comparison of the effectiveness between preservatives which were mixed with the paste and those which were applied on the surface, and further with the effectiveness of casing with cellophane, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate film and of infrared and/or <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>ray</b> irradiation all over the surface of 2 ̆ 2 Kamaboko 2 ̆ 2. 1. When the preservatives were mixed with the paste, dehydroacetic acid and its sodium salt were effective in prolonging the storage life to six and four days, respectively, in contrast to two days in the control at 26 ℃. However, the preservatives which were smeared on the surface were not effective (See Tables 1 and 2). 2. Among the preservatives which were mixed with the 2 ̆ 2 Kamaboko 2 ̆ 2, butyl p-hydroxybenzoate and o-hydroxybenzamide showed effectiveness to some extent on keeping quality (See Table 3). 3. The casing with polyvinyl alchol film gave rather an inferior result. The combination of the casing with polyvinyl alcohol film and the mixing with preservatives shortened the shelf-life compared to the control (See Table 4). 4. In the case of 2 ̆ 2 Kamaboko 2 ̆ 2 without the casing, irradiation by the infrared ray for short time prevented the growth of bacteria. However, irradiation by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>ray</b> showed remarkable effect on inhibition of bacterial growth. Irradiation by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>ray</b> twice daily was slightly more effective than that once daily.
