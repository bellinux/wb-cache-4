2500|$|Also on March 10, Cramer {{appeared}} on MSNBC's Morning Joe. Commentator Joe Scarborough {{weighed in on}} the feud, criticizing Stewart and The Daily Show for being unfair to those ideologically opposed to Stewart: [...] "I {{would like to see}} Jon Stewart come out and tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> believes in. Tell us where America needs to go in the future. And let us take a microphone around and a camera around with him 24 hours a day {{for a couple of months}} and then we can edit out all the mistakes he makes. It's very easy to shoot at the arena." ...|$|E
2500|$|He paints, {{or rather}} regards, {{things in a}} way that is {{different}} from that of other artists. He sees only the essential, and that, naturally, is all he paints. For this reason Munch's pictures are as a rule [...] "not complete", as people are so delighted to discover for themselves. Oh, yes, they are complete. His complete handiwork. Art is complete once the artist has really said everything that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of the other generation, that he really knows how to show <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he subordinates everything else.|$|E
2500|$|The 7 RAR mascot and nickname, [...] "the Pigs", has a {{long and}} celebrated history within the {{battalion}}. According to Corporal Roy Savage:The single men of 3 RAR were sent to Puckapunyal {{to form a new}} battalion, 7 RAR. I arrived there on 11th November 1965. At first there were only regular soldiers. We used to keep the boozer open all weekend having the cooks bring our meals there. Anyway, on my second week there the new CO (Colonel Eric Smith) decided to inspect his new battalion area on a Sunday. He immediately closed the boozer. The next day he called a muster parade of the whole battalion and commenced to tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought of us. Half way through his speech he said and I quote, 'You are nothing but a mob of pigs'. Then from the back rank someone called out 'oink oink'. From that time onwards we became the Pig Battalion.|$|E
6000|$|... "It sure does!" [...] {{answered}} his twin, catching {{the book and}} sending it back so quickly that his brother {{was hit in the}} stomach. [...] "And that puts me in mind, Andy. Why not get at Spouter and make him tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> got in mind about our vacation this summer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pshaw! why {{go on with}} this?" [...] cried Mamie, {{suddenly}} rising. [...] "Mr. Dodd is {{not telling}} <b>us</b> either <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thinks or <b>what</b> <b>he</b> knows." ...|$|R
5000|$|... : An {{hour after}} U.S. {{announced}} the captured, President Chen Shui Bian congratulated the <b>U.S.</b> for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called [...] "a big victory".|$|R
60|$|We both {{started at}} that {{extraordinary}} {{view of the}} case, and both earnestly begged him to tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. But he's {{too good}} a {{character}} to lose sight of. He's got {{to come back here}} and tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> intends to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you have}} arrived, {{we will go}} on with the drill," [...] the President remarked. [...] "Afterwards, Señor Marston will tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thinks about my soldiers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let <b>us</b> see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says," [...] he {{suggested}} anxiously. But {{his mother did}} not heed him. She stood balancing the package in her hand.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let us {{take this}} gentleman to see him, and let <b>us</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says,' cried Florence. 'Will {{you go with}} us now? We have a coach here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not try it?" [...] he suggested. [...] "There is {{a detective}} always in {{attendance}} on the premises. Send for him now, and let <b>us</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He did," [...] assented Harry. [...] "Then he {{sent over}} for Webster, who wouldn't tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was wanted for, though he made {{you take that}} gun along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 40 That eunuch {{guardian}} of rich Holland's trade, [...] Who envies <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants power to enjoy; [...] Whose noiseful valour does no foe invade, [...] And weak assistance will his friends destroy.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{would tell}} <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> THOUGHT was true, Dan, but he couldn't KNOW. He's {{not such a}} well-educated man as {{the editor of the}} Enterprise. No, there's nothing to do but wait and see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think Monsieur Trudaine {{was about}} to speak," [...] said Madame Danville. [...] "Perhaps he will have no {{objection}} to let <b>us</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was going to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, that I dare say--but he is {{speaking}} earnestly and in a low voice; listen, and let <b>us</b> know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says. I do not well understand at this distance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There comes Hans," [...] said Mrs. Meyrick. [...] "Stand still, and let <b>us</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{says about}} the dress. Artists are the best people to consult about such things." ...|$|R
60|$|To know {{good and}} evil, right and wrong--to have a conscience, a moral sense--that is the {{likeness}} of God of which I wish to preach to-day. Because it is through THAT knowledge of good and evil, and through it alone, that we can know God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent. It is through our moral sense that God speaks to us; through our {{sense of right and}} wrong; through that I say, God speaks to us, whether in reproof or encouragement, in wrath or in love; to teach <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is like, and to teach <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is not like.|$|E
60|$|W. Do! Why, go to him, {{and tell}} him of it beforehand, then; {{and let him know}} that the ship firing is not at him nor his men; and then come again, and tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{were good}} reasons for Lawrence's not writing home and they made it awkward for us to write {{to him for a}} time. You can now tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has done in Canada. We want to know." ...|$|E
60|$|Such, {{in broad}} light and brief terms, was man for five {{thousand}} years. Such {{he is no}} longer. Let <b>us</b> consider <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is now, comparing the descriptions clause by clause.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, of course, {{nothing can}} be done. If it were only a hundred or two, {{the money would be}} subscribed at once; but fifteen hundred is utterly beyond <b>us.</b> <b>What</b> is <b>he</b> {{thinking}} of doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Get nothing!' replied one of {{the three}} moodily. 'De Nugget ain't dere, an' we was chasin' Sam to fix him, an' he laid for <b>us,</b> an' <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did to Buck was plenty.' ...|$|R
60|$|With that we {{returned}} to our cab and drove away, leaving the man standing in the centre of his boot-bedecked doorway addressing remarks to <b>us.</b> <b>What</b> <b>he</b> said, I did not hear, but the passers-by appeared to find it interesting.|$|E
6000|$|Evidently {{something}} had happened, and Tommy rose {{to go to}} Grizel without even asking what it was. [...] "Wait," [...] David said, wrinkling his eyebrows, [...] "till Corp tells <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> means by that. I knew it might come, Corp. Go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{scarcely}} {{mentioned the}} gold," [...] replied Edna. [...] "We had more precious {{things to talk}} about. When he sees us all together, you and I and Ralph, he will tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has done, and what {{he is going to}} do, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is {{the fellow}} after, Griffin?" [...] said Cuffe. [...] "Can it be he doesn't {{understand}} French? Try him a touch in Italian, and let <b>us</b> see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{will say to}} that." ...|$|R
5000|$|As for Foulbhe , {{their cause}} was lost since mount years;none of <b>us</b> debating <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing.We were driven like cattle to pasture,employees {{to all sorts}} of “taches”,rising, falling , without knowing why or how.|$|R
6000|$|Immediately {{there was}} a roar of voices. [...] "Capponi! Capponi! What said our Piero?" [...] "Ah! he wouldn't stand being sent from Herod to Pilate!" [...] "We knew Piero!" [...] "Orsu! Tell <b>us,</b> <b>what</b> did <b>he</b> say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{question}} is, then, what is {{the symbolic}} character of the Countess Matilda, as the guiding spirit of the terrestrial paradise? Before Dante had entered this paradise he had rested on a step of shelving rock, and {{as he watched the}} stars he slept, and dreamed, and thus tells <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he is a {{very poor}} correspondent. He just told <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had been doing, but said very little about his adventures. I suppose he thought that girls would not care to hear about midshipmen's doings. He did tell us, though, that he had had a fight with a dog that had bitten you." ...|$|E
60|$|He said {{he would}} show us the imposture so {{that we might be}} warned against it, and not be taken in by it; and he fetched Uncle's pack of cards from the tea-caddy, and, {{selecting}} three cards from the pack, two plain cards and one picture card, sat down on the hearthrug, and explained to <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was going to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is Harcutt," [...] he exclaimed, {{pointing}} {{him out to}} Felix. [...] "He is a journalist, you know, and {{in search}} of a sensation. Let <b>us</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has to say about these things." ...|$|R
6000|$|Abel Hunt! And that scoundrel had {{followed}} <b>us,</b> knowing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did about Saul, {{without saying anything}} whatsoever concerning the lad; but striving to find where we were lodged so he might work yet further mischief! ...|$|R
6000|$|HOTCHKISS. Polly: I ask you on {{my knees}} to let me make George's {{acquaintance}} in his home this afternoon; and I shall remain {{on my knees}} till the Bishop comes in and sees <b>us.</b> <b>What</b> will <b>he</b> think of you then? ...|$|R
