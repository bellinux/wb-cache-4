5|$|The <b>ubiquitin</b> protein {{itself is}} 76 amino acids long {{and was named}} due to its {{ubiquitous}} nature, as it has a highly conserved sequence and is found in all known eukaryotic organisms. The genes encoding <b>ubiquitin</b> in eukaryotes are arranged in tandem repeats, possibly due to the heavy transcription demands on these genes to produce enough <b>ubiquitin</b> for the cell. It has been proposed that <b>ubiquitin</b> is the slowest-evolving protein identified to date. <b>Ubiquitin</b> contains seven lysine residues to which another <b>ubiquitin</b> can be ligated, resulting in different types of polyubiquitin chains. Chains in which each additional <b>ubiquitin</b> is linked to lysine 48 of the previous <b>ubiquitin</b> {{have a role in}} proteasome targeting, while other types of chains may be involved in other processes.|$|E
5|$|Proteasomes {{are part}} of a major {{mechanism}} by which cells regulate the concentration of particular proteins and degrade misfolded proteins. Proteins are tagged for degradation with a small protein called <b>ubiquitin.</b> The tagging reaction is catalyzed by enzymes called <b>ubiquitin</b> ligases. Once a protein is tagged with a single <b>ubiquitin</b> molecule, this is a signal to other ligases to attach additional <b>ubiquitin</b> molecules. The result is a polyubiquitin chain that is bound by the proteasome, allowing it to degrade the tagged protein. The degradation process yields peptides of about seven to eight amino acids long, which can then be further degraded into shorter amino acid sequences and used in synthesizing new proteins.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{targeted}} for degradation by the proteasome with covalent modification of a lysine residue {{that requires the}} coordinated reactions of three enzymes. In the first step, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (known as E1) hydrolyzes ATP and adenylylates a <b>ubiquitin</b> molecule. This is then transferred to E1's active-site cysteine residue {{in concert with the}} adenylylation of a second <b>ubiquitin.</b> This adenylylated <b>ubiquitin</b> is then transferred to a cysteine of a second enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). In the last step, a member of a highly diverse class of enzymes known as <b>ubiquitin</b> ligases (E3) recognizes the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes the transfer of <b>ubiquitin</b> from E2 to this target protein. A target protein must be labeled with at least four <b>ubiquitin</b> monomers (in the form of a polyubiquitin chain) before it is recognized by the proteasome lid. It is therefore the E3 that confers substrate specificity to this system. The number of E1, E2, and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and cell type, but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans, indicating that there is a huge number of targets for the <b>ubiquitin</b> proteasome system.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the <b>ubiquitin</b> proteasome system, protein degradation in cells was thought to rely mainly on lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles with acidic and protease-filled interiors that can degrade and then recycle exogenous proteins and aged or damaged organelles. However, work by Alfred Goldberg in 1977 on ATP-dependent protein degradation in reticulocytes, which lack lysosomes, suggested the presence of a second intracellular degradation mechanism. This was shown in 1978 to be composed of several distinct protein chains, a novelty among proteases at the time. Later work on modification of histones led to the identification of an unexpected covalent modification of the histone protein by a bond between a lysine side chain of the histone and the C-terminal glycine residue of <b>ubiquitin,</b> a protein that had no known function. It was then discovered that a previously identified protein associated with proteolytic degradation, known as ATP-dependent proteolysis factor 1 (APF-1), was the same protein as <b>ubiquitin.</b> The proteolytic activities of this system was isolated as a multi-protein complex originally called the multi-catalytic proteinase complex by Sherwin Wilk and Marion Orlowski. Later, the ATP-dependent proteolytic complex that was responsible for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation was discovered and was called the 26S proteasome.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, two {{independent}} efforts have elucidated the molecular {{architecture of the}} 26S proteasome by single particle electron microscopy. More recently, a pseudo-atomic atomic model has been built, again using cryo-EM. In {{the heart of the}} 19S, directly adjacent to the 20S, are the AAA-ATPases (AAA proteins) that assemble to a heterohexameric ring of the order Rpt1/Rpt2/Rpt6/Rpt3/Rpt4/Rpt5. This ring is a trimer of dimers: Rpt1/Rpt2, Rpt6/Rpt3, and Rpt4/Rpt5 dimerize via their N-terminal coiled-coils. These coiled-coils protrude from the hexameric ring. The largest regulatory particle non-ATPases Rpn1 and Rpn2 bind to the tips of Rpt1/2 and Rpt6/3, respectively. The <b>ubiquitin</b> receptor Rpn13 binds to Rpn2 and completes the base cub-complex. The lid covers one half of the AAA-ATPase hexamer (Rpt6/Rpt3/Rpt4) and, unexpectedly, directly contacts the 20S via Rpn6 and to lesser extent Rpn5. The subunits Rpn9, Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn7, Rpn3, and Rpn12, which are structurally related among themselves and to subunits of the COP9 complex and eIF3 (hence called PCI subunits) assemble to a horseshoe-like structure enclosing the Rpn8/Rpn11 heterodimer. Rpn11, the deubiquinating enzyme, is placed {{at the mouth of the}} AAA-ATPase hexamer, ideally positioned to remove <b>ubiquitin</b> moieties immediately before translocation of substrates into the 20S. The second <b>ubiquitin</b> receptor identified to date, Rpn10, is positioned at the periphery of the lid, near subunits Rpn8 and Rpn9.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{components}} of the 19S particle have their own regulatory roles. Gankyrin, a recently identified oncoprotein, {{is one of the}} 19S subcomponents that also tightly binds the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4 and {{plays a key role in}} recognizing ubiquitinated p53, via its affinity for the <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase MDM2. Gankyrin is anti-apoptotic and has been shown to be overexpressed in some tumor cell types such as hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which a polyubiquitinated protein is targeted to the proteasome is not fully understood. Ubiquitin-receptor proteins have an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and one or more ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. The UBL domains are recognized by the 19S proteasome caps and the UBA domains bind <b>ubiquitin</b> via three-helix bundles. These receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome, though the specifics of this interaction and its regulation are unclear.|$|E
5|$|The proteasomal {{degradation}} pathway {{is essential}} for many cellular processes, including the cell cycle, the regulation of gene expression, and responses to oxidative stress. The importance of proteolytic degradation inside cells {{and the role of}} <b>ubiquitin</b> in proteolytic pathways was acknowledged in the award of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko and Irwin Rose.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{cell cycle}} checkpoints such as post-restriction point check between G1 phase and S phase {{similarly}} involve proteasomal degradation of cyclin A, whose ubiquitination is {{promoted by the}} anaphase promoting complex (APC), an E3 <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase. The APC and the Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein complex (SCF complex) are the two key regulators of cyclin degradation and checkpoint control; the SCF itself is regulated by the APC via ubiquitination of the adaptor protein, Skp2, which prevents SCF activity before the G1-S transition.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to cellular stresses– such as infection, heat shock, or oxidative damage– heat shock proteins that identify misfolded or unfolded proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation are expressed. Both Hsp27 and Hsp90—chaperone proteins have {{been implicated in}} increasing {{the activity of the}} ubiquitin-proteasome system, though they are not direct participants in the process. Hsp70, on the other hand, binds exposed hydrophobic patches on the surface of misfolded proteins and recruits E3 <b>ubiquitin</b> ligases such as CHIP to tag the proteins for proteasomal degradation. The CHIP protein (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) is itself regulated via inhibition of interactions between the E3 enzyme CHIP and its E2 binding partner.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the early}} work {{leading up to the}} {{discovery}} of the <b>ubiquitin</b> proteasome system occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the Technion in the laboratory of Avram Hershko, where Aaron Ciechanover worked as a graduate student. Hershko's year-long sabbatical in the laboratory of Irwin Rose at the Fox Chase Cancer Center provided key conceptual insights, though Rose later downplayed his role in the discovery. The three shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work in discovering this system.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{mechanisms}} {{exist to}} promote the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins via the proteasome system. In particular, proteasomes localized to the nucleus are regulated by PARP and actively degrade inappropriately oxidized histones. Oxidized proteins, which often form large amorphous aggregates in the cell, can be degraded directly by the 20S core particle without the 19S regulatory cap and do not require ATP hydrolysis or tagging with <b>ubiquitin.</b> However, high levels of oxidative damage increases the degree of cross-linking between protein fragments, rendering the aggregates resistant to proteolysis. Larger numbers and sizes of such highly oxidized aggregates are associated with aging.|$|E
5|$|Some protein {{complexes}} {{contain a}} large central cavity that is {{isolated from the}} remainder of the cytosol. One example of such an enclosed compartment is the proteasome. Here, a set of subunits form a hollow barrel containing proteases that degrade cytosolic proteins. Since these would be damaging if they mixed freely with {{the remainder of the}} cytosol, the barrel is capped by a set of regulatory proteins that recognize proteins with a signal directing them for degradation (a <b>ubiquitin</b> tag) and feed them into the proteolytic cavity.|$|E
5|$|Dysregulation of the <b>ubiquitin</b> {{proteasome}} {{system may}} contribute to several neural diseases. It may lead to brain tumors such as astrocytomas. In some of the late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that share aggregation of misfolded proteins as a common feature, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, large insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins can form and then result in neurotoxicity, through mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Decreased proteasome activity has been suggested {{as a cause of}} aggregation and Lewy body formation in Parkinson's. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that yeast models of Parkinson's are more susceptible to toxicity from α-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies, under conditions of low proteasome activity. Impaired proteasomal activity may underlie cognitive disorders such as the autism spectrum disorders, and muscle and nerve diseases such as inclusion body myopathy.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} subcomponents {{are often}} referred to by their Svedberg sedimentation coefficient (denoted S). The proteasome most exclusively used in mammals is the cytosolic 26S proteasome, which is about 2000 kilodaltons (kDa) in molecular mass containing one 20S protein subunit and two 19S regulatory cap subunits. The core is hollow and provides an enclosed cavity in which proteins are degraded; openings at the two ends of the core allow the target protein to enter. Each end of the core particle associates with a 19S regulatory subunit that contains multiple ATPase active sites and <b>ubiquitin</b> binding sites; it is this structure that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins and transfers them to the catalytic core. An alternative form of regulatory subunit called the 11S particle can associate with the core in essentially {{the same manner as}} the 19S particle; the 11S {{may play a role in}} degradation of foreign peptides such as those produced after infection by a virus.|$|E
5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to <b>ubiquitin</b> in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are not common unless the person is demented.|$|E
25|$|The NEDD4 protein has a modular {{structure}} that is shared among the NEDD4 family, consisting of an amino-terminal C2 calcium-dependent phospholipid binding domain, 3-4 WW protein-protein interaction domains, and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic HECT <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase domain. The C2 domain targets proteins to the phospholipid membrane, {{and can also}} be involved in targeting substrates. The WW domains interact with proline rich PPxY motifs in target proteins to mediate interactions with substrates and adaptors. The catalytic HECT domain forms a thioester bond with activated <b>ubiquitin</b> transferred from an E2 <b>ubiquitin</b> conjugating enzyme, before transferring <b>ubiquitin</b> directly to a specific substrate.|$|E
25|$|One {{limitation}} of classic yeast two-hybrid screens {{is that they}} are limited to soluble proteins. It is therefore impossible to use them to study the protein–protein interactions between insoluble integral membrane proteins. The split-ubiquitin system provides a method for overcoming this limitation. In the split-ubiquitin system, two integral membrane proteins to be studied are fused to two different <b>ubiquitin</b> moieties: a C-terminal <b>ubiquitin</b> moiety ("Cub", residues 35–76) and an N-terminal <b>ubiquitin</b> moiety ("Nub", residues 1–34). These fused proteins are called the bait and prey, respectively. In addition to being fused to an integral membrane protein, the Cub moiety is also fused to a transcription factor (TF) that can be cleaved off by <b>ubiquitin</b> specific proteases. Upon bait–prey interaction, Nub and Cub-moieties assemble, reconstituting the split-ubiquitin. The reconstituted split-ubiquitin molecule is recognized by <b>ubiquitin</b> specific proteases, which cleave off the transcription factor, allowing it to induce the transcription of reporter genes.|$|E
25|$|Cullin-4B is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the CUL4B gene {{which is located}} on the X chromosome. The extreme N-terminus of CUL4B is disordered and, currently, it is unclear what {{structural}} and functional qualities it possesses. CUL4B binds to the beta-propeller of the DDB1 adaptor protein which interacts with numerous DDB1-CUL4-Associated Factors (DCAFs). This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of substrates to the <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase complex. At the C-terminal end, CUL4B interacts with the RBX1/ROC1 protein via its RING domain. RBX1 is a core component of Cullin-RING <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase (CRL) complexes and functions to recruit E2 <b>ubiquitin</b> conjugating enzymes. Therefore, the C-terminus of CUL4B - along with RBX1 and activated E2 enzymes - compose the catalytic core of CRL4B complexes. CUL4B is also modified by covalent attachment of a NEDD8 molecule at a highly conserved lysine residue in the C-terminal region. This modification appears to induce conformational changes which promotes flexibility in the RING domain of cullin proteins and enhanced <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase activity.|$|E
25|$|The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases SMURF1 and SMURF2 {{regulate}} {{the levels of}} SMADs. They accept <b>ubiquitin</b> from an E2 conjugating enzyme where they transfer <b>ubiquitin</b> to the RSMADs which causes their ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation. SMURF1 binds to SMAD1 and SMAD5 while SMURF2 binds SMAD1, SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD6 and SMAD7. It enhances the inhibitory action of SMAD7 while reducing the transcriptional activities of SMAD2.|$|E
25|$|QSER1 {{was found}} to {{interact}} with <b>ubiquitin</b> in two proteome-wide substrate studies. Specific details about this interaction have not been studied.|$|E
25|$|SUMO {{proteins}} {{are similar}} to <b>ubiquitin,</b> and SUMOylation is directed by an enzymatic cascade analogous to that involved in ubiquitination. In contrast to <b>ubiquitin,</b> SUMO is not used to tag proteins for degradation. Mature SUMO is produced when the last four amino acids of the C-terminus have been cleaved off to allow formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine residue of SUMO and an acceptor lysine on the target protein.|$|E
25|$|Stability – A {{subset of}} docking motifs recruit E3 <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase to their substrates. The {{resulting}} polyubiquitination targets the substrate for proteosomal destruction.|$|E
25|$|Johanson–Blizzard {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} mutations in the UBR1 gene, which encodes one of several <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase enzymes of the N-end rule pathway.|$|E
25|$|Ubiquitin-mediated {{degradation}} of proteins occurs through the N-end rule pathway. In eukaryotes, including humans, the N-end rule pathway {{is part of}} the <b>ubiquitin</b> system. Composed of a highly selective single-residue code (a single amino acid nucleotide sequence), the N-end rule serves as a mechanism which can relate the stability of a protein to the identity of the amino acid at its N-terminus (the end of the polypeptide with an amino group, which in the <b>ubiquitin</b> system may be involved in the reactive destabilization of the protein).|$|E
25|$|The label {{consists}} of a molecule called <b>ubiquitin.</b> This fastens to the protein to be destroyed, accompanies it to the proteasome where it is recognised as the key in a lock, and signals that a protein {{is on the way}} for disassembly. Shortly before the protein is squeezed into the proteasome, its <b>ubiquitin</b> label is disconnected for re-use. Examples of processes governed by ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation are cell division, DNA repair, quality control of newly produced proteins, and important parts of the immune defence.|$|E
25|$|NEDD4L is a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) that accepts <b>ubiquitin</b> from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in {{the form}} of a {{thioester}} and then transfers it to specific substrates.|$|E
25|$|NEDD4 {{can also}} {{function}} independently of its <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase activity. NEDD4 interacts with VEGFR2, {{leading to the}} degradation of VEGFR2 irrespective of whether the HECT domain is catalytically active.|$|E
25|$|The protein complex SCFβ-TrCP1/2 is an E3 <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase that {{functions}} in Wee1A ubiquitination. The M-phase kinases Polo-like kinase (Plk1) and Cdc2 phosphorylate two serine residues in Wee1A which are recognized by SCFβ-TrCP1/2.|$|E
25|$|The S.cerevisiae protein Swe1 is also {{regulated}} by degradation. Swe1 is hyperphosphorylated by Clb2-Cdc28 and Cdc5 {{which may be}} a signal for ubiquitination and degradation by SCF E3 <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase complex as in higher eukaryotes.|$|E
25|$|In JBS, {{mutations}} in the UBR1 gene alter, disrupt or prevent {{the synthesis of}} <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase. In the pancreatic acinar cells, UBR1 is more highly expressed {{than anywhere else in}} the body. Impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system directly related to insufficient activity of <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase has been established as the cause of both congenital and progressive inflammatory damage, fatty tissue replacement, connective tissue proliferation and errors in innervation of the acini and islets, correlating to failures of normal apoptotic destruction of damaged cells and constitutive malpresence of proteins. This also applies to other areas affected by deleterious UBR1 expression, such as the craniofacial area, musculoskeletal and nervous systems, dentition and organs.|$|E
25|$|Mike Tyka is a {{computational}} biochemist at the University of Washington {{working with}} David Baker. Tyka {{has been making}} sculptures of protein molecules since 2010 from copper and steel, including <b>ubiquitin</b> and a potassium channel tetramer.|$|E
25|$|Client {{proteins}} are {{steroid hormone}} receptors, kinases, <b>ubiquitin</b> ligases, transcription factors and proteins from many more families. Examples of HSP90AB1 client proteins are p38MAPK/MAPK14 (mitogen activated protein kinase 14), ERK5 (extracellular regulated kinase 5), or the checkpoint kinase Wee1.|$|E
25|$|Recently, new {{findings}} have emerged that suggest a novel mechanism of teratogenicity. Cereblon is a 51 kDa protein localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus and peripheral membrane of cells in numerous {{parts of the}} body. It acts {{as a component of}} the E3 <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase, regulating various developmental processes, including embryogenesis, carcinogenesis and cell cycle regulation, through degradation (ubiquitination) of unknown substrates. Thalidomide has been shown to bind to cereblon, inhibiting the activity of the E3 <b>ubiquitin</b> ligase, resulting in accumulation of the ligase substrates and downregulation of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and FGF10. This disrupts the positive feedback loop between the two growth factors, possibly causing both multiple birth defects and anti-myeloma effects.|$|E
25|$|Once protein {{synthesis}} is complete, {{the level of}} expression of that protein can be reduced by protein degradation. There are major protein degradation pathways in all prokaryotes and eukaryotes, of which the proteasome is a common component. An unneeded or damaged protein is often labeled for degradation by addition of <b>ubiquitin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The NEDD4-2 protein {{consists}} of an amino-terminal Ca2+-phospholipid binding domain (C2), 4 WW domains (protein-protein interaction domains) and the carboxyl-terminal HECT domain (<b>ubiquitin</b> ligase domain). The WW domains in the protein are responsible for binding the substrates, regulatory proteins and adaptors. These domains generally recognize PPxY (or similar) motifs in the target proteins.|$|E
