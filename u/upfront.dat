5|$|A {{conflict}} arose with Paramount {{over the}} film's budget. Foster had thirty days {{to set up}} a new deal with another studio, or Paramount would own the exclusive rights. He was inundated with offers and accepted one from First Artists Group, because McQueen would receive no <b>upfront</b> salary, just 10% of the gross receipts from the first dollar taken in on the film. This would become very profitable if the film was a box office hit.|$|E
5|$|Indiana Jones is {{distributed}} by one entity, Paramount, but owned by another, Lucasfilm. The pre-production arrangement {{between the two}} organizations granted Paramount 12.5% of the film's revenue. As the $185 million budget was larger than the original $125 million estimate, Lucas, Spielberg and Ford turned down large <b>upfront</b> salaries so Paramount could cover the film's costs. In order for Paramount to see a profit beyond its distribution fee, the film had to make over $400 million. At that point, Lucas, Spielberg, Ford and those with smaller profit-sharing deals would also begin to collect their cut.|$|E
5|$|It was {{released}} {{as a single}} on 3 December 2007 in the United Kingdom to mixed reviews from music critics.

It entered the top fifty in the UK and became Minogue's thirteenth <b>Upfront</b> Club Chart number one. The song's music video, directed by Andy Soup, was filmed in London, England, and features Minogue in a multi-coloured studio surrounded by a starry background and four dancers.|$|E

If the final agreement goes ahead, Cardiff Athletic Club would receive an <b>upfront</b> payment of approximately £8 million. As part of the agreement, the bowls section would have to vacate its current site at the Arms Park and {{move to a new}} facility. At present Cardiff Blues pay Cardiff Athletic Club rent of around £115,000 per annum, however this would nearly double to around £200,000.|$|E
5|$|Paul Merson {{returned}} to the Arsenal squad, after his much-publicised cocaine, alcohol and drug addiction. The England international, who was admitted to a rehabilitation clinic for treatment during his absence, started on the substitutes' bench. Arsenal lined up in a 4–4–2 formation, with Ian Wright paired alongside John Hartson <b>upfront</b> and Kevin Campbell shifted {{on the right of}} midfield. Milan lined up in a similar formation, with Marcel Desailly and Demetrio Albertini anchoring the midfield.|$|E
5|$|Titan {{was funded}} {{primarily}} by the US Department of Energy through ORNL. Funding was sufficient to purchase the CPUs {{but not all of}} the GPUs so the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration agreed to fund the remaining nodes in return for computing time.

5|$|After {{these changes}} were made, the test {{audience}} became more {{appreciative of the}} series, and GSN announced its development {{to the public at}} an <b>upfront</b> presentation in New York City on March 21, 2012 for the network's upcoming programming. By this time, a pilot episode had already been shot with American stand-up comedian and television personality Jeff Foxworthy performing the hosting duties for the show. When first asked if he was interested in hosting the show, Foxworthy was hesitant; he agreed to take on the role after learning that contestants would be playing for charity rather than on their own behalf. Casting for the series was held in various cities from May to June 2012. On July 7, 2012, GSN confirmed the show would premiere on August 23, 2012, alongside the premiere of Beat the Chefs.|$|E
5|$|Coyle cold called Kristin Chenoweth's {{agent and}} {{proposed}} the part, which {{is different from}} her usual roles, and her agent {{said it was the}} exact part the actress was seeking. In order to film Into Temptation, Chenoweth took a five-day hiatus from her supporting role on the ABC television series Pushing Daisies. Brian Baumgartner, best known for his supporting role as Kevin Malone in the NBC comedy series The Office, was a regular theater performer in the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area before joining that show. While visiting New York City in May 2008 for an <b>upfront</b> presentation, shortly after having finished filming the fourth season of The Office, Baumgartner was offered the Into Temptation script by Coyle, who asked him to consider taking the role of Father Ralph O'Brien. Baumgartner said he enjoyed the script and agreed to the part.|$|E
5|$|Repairs to the RAAF's F-111Cs were {{undertaken}} {{from late}} 1971, and all 24 were accepted on 15March 1973. The RAAF considered retaining the Phantoms after the F-111s entered service, and the US Government offered {{to sell the}} 23 remaining aircraft to Australia for $54 million. Studies found that the <b>upfront</b> cost of keeping the F-4Es would be $77 million, {{and that one of}} the MirageIII squadrons would need to be disbanded to man the Phantom-equipped units. Nevertheless, the Air Board recommended that the aircraft be retained, but a proposal to do so was rejected by the Cabinet in 1972 on advice from the Treasury. If the Phantoms had remained in service they would have been used to provide close air support for the Army.|$|E

Effectively, this meant Nat Geo Wild would launch the same way it did in the United States in June 2010, as NGW replaced Fox Reality Channel in the United States, though there was very little similar between Fox and Global's reality channel efforts.|$|R
50|$|At TQS' 2009 <b>upfronts</b> presentation, it was {{announced}} that Dumont would join the network in the fall as host of a daily news and information series, Dumont 360. The series launched in September 2009, shortly after the network was rebranded as V.|$|R
5|$|The show {{received}} {{very little}} advanced press {{before it was}} announced at GSN's 2014–15 <b>upfront</b> presentation on March 18, 2014. At the presentation, GSN revealed plans to order 40 episodes of the series, while confirming August 12 as the premiere date on June 19, 2014.

5|$|Arsenal {{scored the}} game's only {{goal in the}} 24th minute; set-up by Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain managed to cut inside César Azpilicueta {{on the right and}} shoot the ball into the top-left corner of Courtois's net. It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded against Arsenal in 506 minutes. Most of the action in the first half was {{conducted}} in a congested midfield, with Fàbregas attempting to sedate the rhythm and the Arsenal midfielders forcing their opponents to play narrow. This favoured Arsenal, who had space to counter-attack had Chelsea lost the ball. Ramires nearly levelled the scoreline in the 33rd minute, but his curling effort failed to creep into the bottom right-hand corner. Ramires then missed another chance, heading the ball high and over the Arsenal goal after good work by Rémy. Arsenal created another chance to score four minutes before the break, when Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross found Monreal, who under pressure from Ivanovic headed over. Rémy, often a lone figure <b>upfront,</b> was ruled offside late on.|$|E
5|$|Most reviewers {{recommended}} the iPhone 5S over the iPhone 5C which was released {{at the same}} time. The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5S featured substantially improved performance/features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional <b>upfront</b> cost over the iPhone 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and {{low end of the}} iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while the iPhone 5C had to make do with 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due its additional gold finish.|$|E
50|$|Telemundo Deportes, a {{dedicated}} Hispanic sports production unit, was also announced by Joe Uva, Chairman of NBCUniversal Hispanic Group, and chairman Mark Lazarus at May 2015 <b>Upfronts.</b> Telemundo Deportes {{was also in}} process of moving to the NBC Sports Group facility in Stamford.|$|R
