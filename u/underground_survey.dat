40|$|<b>Underground</b> <b>surveying</b> of cellars, caves, and {{architectural}} spaces, {{is quite different}} from surveying on the surface. Researchers must deal with various challenges derived of the lack of natural light, low temperature, and humidity, but also with inaccessibility. But the essential problem in <b>underground</b> <b>surveying</b> is that of orientating the <b>underground</b> <b>surveys</b> to the surface surveys. For this purpose our methodology integrates different geomatic techniques, as the use of a scanner laser in order to obtain a 3 D model, as well as classic topography, and GPS to locate accurately the control points according to the official reference frame of the Spanish Geodetic Network. The developed methodology is described and applied to the case study of the cellars of the Gallery of Convalescents (Galería de Convalecientes) in the Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. These cellars compose an outstanding series of interrelated singular complex spaces. Their study is particularly relevant because {{of the quality of the}} stonework, the geometry of the vaults and lunettes, and the stereotomy. The fact that these spaces were neither surveyed nor studied before, must be stressed. And our work will bring into light an important part of the 16 th century Spanish architectural heritage.

40|$|Abstract]: Environmental {{conditions}} in underground coal mines effect lateral refraction when surveying {{with a regular}} theodolite. Xstrata Coal’s Oaky North Mine situated 26 Km east of Tieri in Central Queensland’s Bowen Basin has overcome these environmental conditions by utilising gyrotheodolites to control the <b>underground</b> <b>survey</b> network. This project studies the environmental conditions effecting lateral refraction and how Oaky North Mine utilises gyrotheodolites to control the <b>underground</b> <b>survey</b> network. Oaky North Mine is an underground longwall coal operation, producing approximately 5 million tonnes of sub-bituminous, medium volatile coal per annum. Two pairs of parallel tunnels (gateroads) with cross cuts every 100 m are driven using a continuous miner for a length of approximately 3. 4 Km. These gateroads form the maingate and tailgate of the longwall block. The demand for an accurate underground control network is high. Typically, accuracies of ± 50 mm are expected allowing a breakthrough tolerance of ± 100 mm. The ability to establish accurate control networks and perform associated surveys is restricted by lateral refraction. The path of light through the atmosphere {{is influenced by the}} inhomogenities of the refractive index. This refractive effect deteriorates the pointing accuracy of survey lines. Currently, there is no available method to accurately correct these systematic errors. This project investigates whether literature research supporting the use of a gyrotheodolite, will improve breakthrough errors of an open ended traverse or when compared to the readings from TCRA 1203 vary sufficiently to be outside accepted tolerances. Specifically, in this project, the gyrotheodolite used is the DMT (Deutsche Montan Technologie) Gyromat 2000, permanently fixed to a Wild T 2 theodolite. The Gyromat 2000 is a fully automated high precision (1. 5 cm every 1 Km) surveying gyroscope with a measuring time < 10 mins...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{the results of}} full lithostratigraphic, pedological and geoarchaeological studies {{carried out in the}} Pompeii archaeological area (southern Italy), combined with logs data, surface and <b>underground</b> <b>survey</b> of lava and tephra outcrops. The ancient Pompeii is probably the most famous and complex site of archaeological investigation in the world. Through many studies have been devoted to various archaeological aspects, detailed reconstructions of the geological setting and history of geoarchaeological landscapes are still lacking. At present, Pompeii landscape consists of low hills recognized as volcanic landforms and attributed to the Somma-Vesuvius volcano activity; they correspond to ancient local vents covered of a multilayered succession of repeated volcanic deposits and paleosoils, mainly related to alternating volcanic activity and quiescence periods with consequent pedogenesis (De Maio and Stefani, 2004; D’Ambrosio et al., 2001; Cinque and Irollo, 2004). This succession comprises at least the last 40, 000 years of sedimentation history, reflecting the entire spectrum of eruption types of the Somma-Vesuvius, i. e. from Plinian to sub- Plinian eruptions, relatively small eruptions to effusive volcanic events and, on the other hand, soil formations of different durations, intensities and soil-forming environments. Before the foundation of the city, paleosoils repeatedly reveal clear evidence of anthropogenic activity, represented by agricultural practices. Once the city has taken to develop, anthropogenic landscape changes become particularly pronounced. The various periods of edification of the city walls required different types of land management, related to the variable morphological profiles encountered along of defensive wall circuit (longer than 3 km). Outcrops were deeply modified with quarries, underground excavations, earthworks. Several wells were drilled deeper than 20 meters to reach the water table. Two main geological sections, carried out through the Tempio di Venere and the Regio VIII Insula southern lava cliff, show a core of lavas locally capping buried deposits of the Campanian Ignimbrite. Geological risk assessment in such a complex archaeological site needs specific evaluations/methods and flexibility, according to specific conditions and case studies. Di Maio G. & Stefani G. 2004.

The pumped mine water was heavily contaminated with up to 40 mg/l zinc and badly damaged {{the ecology of the}} receiving watercourse, the Rookhope Burn. Careful, repeated <b>underground</b> <b>surveys</b> allowed the identification of the nature and sources of the major components of the mine water make. Prediction of the rate of rebound took into account the likely reduction in head-dependent inflows as the mine flooded. It was also predicted that acidification of the water would occur when it reached the level of some pyrite-rich shales within the workings, but that further rise of the water table would be accompanied by neutralisation by limestone dissolution higher in the workings. Both the changes in water level and the changes in chemistry have been largely borne out by subsequent monitoring, demonstrating the increasing reliability of predictive methods for abandoned mines...|$|R

40|$|Geological hazards (or geo-hazards) pose {{a serious}} threat to the {{built-up}} environment, and are the cause of severe damage and economic losses to society, especially when involving the underground setting. The final phase of evolution of instability processes may be very rapid, if not catastrophic, often resulting in casualties. In karst, the main geo-hazard is represented by sinkholes, involving both natural caves and man-made cavities. Studies on sinkholes, which necessarily have to include <b>underground</b> <b>surveys,</b> are typically performed by scientist-cavers, or by cavers acting in support of the scientists. The role of cavers is crucial, since they are able to evaluate the situations of danger existing underground, and to reach sites where non-cavers are not able to go. This allows cavers to collect a fundamental documentation of what is happening underground, which {{must be taken into account}} by authorities and people in charge of land management and planning.
