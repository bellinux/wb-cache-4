At its onset, it may involve one organ alone {{or more than}} one organ simultaneously; over a time, additional manifestations due to the involvement of other organs may occur. Our observations have confirmed that hematological manifestations are the commonest initial presentation in SLE.

Collectively, these diseases account for the bulk of health care burden associated with age-related neurodegenerative disorders. There is therefore an urgent need to further research into the molecular pathogenesis, histological differentiation, and clinical management of NDD. Importantly, there is also an urgency to understand the similarities and differences between these two diseases so as to identify the common or different upstream and downstream signaling pathways. In this review, the role iron play in NDD will be highlighted, as iron is key to a common underlying pathway in the production of oxidative stress. There is increasing evidence to suggest that oxidative stress predisposed cells to <b>undergo</b> <b>damage</b> to DNA, protein and lipid, and as such a common factor involved in the pathogenesis of AD and PD.

However, overload of iron results in increased oxidative stress due to the Fenton reaction. We discuss evidence to suggest that sustained exercise and diet restriction may be ways to slow the rate of neurodegeneration, by perhaps promoting neurogenesis or antioxidant-related pathways. It is also our intention to cover NDD in a broad sense, in the context of basic and clinical sciences to cater for both clinician’s and the scientist’s needs, and to highlight current research investigating exercise as a therapeutic or preventive measure...|$|E

In conventional approaches, some types of sensors used to obtain the multi-modal information are attached to the point of contact where the force is applied and at the joint. However, this approach is not sustainable for daily use in robots, i. e., not durable or robust, because the sensors can <b>undergo</b> <b>damage</b> due to the application of excessive force and wear due to repeated contacts.

We derive the relationships between information and the pressures of a two-degrees-of-freedom (2 -DoF) joint mechanism driven by four pneumatic actuators.

40|$|The {{focus in}} {{relation}} to the conse-quences of nerve damage in diabeteshas been the loss of sensation in the feet predisposing to the development of foot ulceration and lower extremity am-putation (1). However, the cornea is 300 – 600 times more sensitive than skin (2). In addition to serving a protective function, corneal nerves regulate corneal epithelial integrity, proliferation, and wound heal-ing (3). In diabetic patients, corneal sen-sitivity is reduced (4), due to a loss of corneal nerve fibers (5), which leads to corneal keratopathy (6, 7) and a suscepti-bility to injury, with recurrent erosions and ulcers (8). Thus, these changes are analogous to the diabetic foot, but be-cause the cornea is not exposed to high pressures, ulceration infrequently occurs. Corneal sensation is mediated via myelin-ated A- and C-nerve fibers (9, 10), which can be evaluated using the Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer (C-BA) (2) or the noncon-tact corneal aesthesiometer (NCCA) (11), respectively. In diabetic patients, the C-BA has been used to show a reduction in corneal sensitivity in some (12) but not other (13) studies. Furthermore, loss of corneal sensation has been related to the severity of retinopathy (12) and neuropa-thy (14). We have assessed corneal sensitivity in a large group of diabetic patients using both C-BA and NCCA to assess concor-dance between the two methods and also to define whether C-nerve fibers are the earliest to <b>undergo</b> <b>damage</b> (15).

40|$|AbstractCreep {{models for}} {{unidirectional}} ceramic matrix composites reinforced by long creeping fibers with weak interfaces are presented. These models extend {{the work of}} Du and McMeeking (1995) [Du, Z., McMeeking, R. 1995. Creep models for metal matrix composites with long brittle fibers. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 43, 701 – 726] to include the effect of fiber primary creep present in the required operational temperatures for ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). The effects of fiber breaks and the consequential stress relaxation around the breaks are incorporated in the models under the assumption of global load sharing and time-independent stochastics for fiber failure. From the set of problems analyzed, {{it is found that}} the high-temperature deformation of CMCs is sensitive to the creep-compliance of the fibers. High fiber creep-compliance drives the composite to creep faster, leading however to greater lifetimes and greater overall strains at rupture. This behavior is attributed {{to the fact that the}} greater the creep-compliance of the fibers, the higher the creep rate but the slower the matrix stress relaxation – since the matrix must deform with a rate compatible with the more creep-resistant fibers – and therefore the less the load carried by the main load-bearing phase, the fibers. As a result, fewer fibers fail and less damage is accumulated in the system. Moreover, the greater the creep-compliance of the fibers, the slower the matrix shear stress relaxation – and thus the lower the levels of applied stress for which this effect becomes important. The slower the shear stress relaxes, the slower the “slip” length increases. Due to the Weibull nature of the fibers, the fiber strengths at the smaller gauge length of the slip length are stronger; therefore fewer fibers <b>undergo</b> <b>damage.</b> Hence, high fiber creep-compliance is desirable (in the absence of any explicit creep-damage mechanism) in terms of composite lifetime but not in terms of overall strain. These results are considered of importance for composite design and optimization...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to model the {{mechanical}} failure of carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy composites due to fiber failure and damage localization. A three-dimensional finite element model is presented {{in order to determine}} the lifetime of these structures. Carbon/epoxy composites are increasingly used as parts of industrial structures. These materials <b>undergo</b> <b>damage</b> that can be detrimental to the mechanical strength of these structures. Filament wound composite structures place the fibers on geodesic paths so that when the structure is pressurized the fibers are only subjected to tensile forces. This allows an analogy to be made between the behavior of a 3 D filament wound composite structure, such as a pressure vessel, and the behavior of a unidirectional composite. This has been exploited in this study. It is clear that when a unidirectional composite is loaded parallel to the fibers, it is the fibers which determine the strength and which must break if the composite is to break. Among all kinds of damage in composites, such as matrix cracking, fiber/matrix debonding,etc, fiber failure becomes important when fiber breakage density increases, resulting in possible catastrophic destruction of the structure. In this work, this phenomenon is studied locally, on the scale of fibers, both in terms of its causes and consequences. Additionally, at the end of this investigation, an approach using the finite element technique is developed to aid engineers in designing an industrial carbon/epoxy unidirectional composite structure and predicting its lifetime based on fiber rupture. Thus, the originality of this approach is based on modeling the physical phenomena at the microscopic level that are associated with fiber breaks, allowing a prediction of failure in a reasonable amount of computational time. This approach takes into consideration heterogeneity at the microscopic level, which leads to a large number of degrees of freedom and therefore an extensive computational time. A simplified multiscale approach is considered for this study...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. This {{research}} project was initiated by a well-known international company (MAKRO SA), which had experienced floor joint problems occurring in their industrial floors. Floor joint problems i. e. joint damage and spalling {{of the joint}} area result, {{from a combination of}} construction workmanship and quality control problems, as well as from operational hard wheeled vehicle loading conditions. Damaging and spalling of joint edges are general problems occurring on warehouse floor slabs because of hard wheeled loads trafficking joints. In addition, joint filler detachment from the joint wall surface looks aesthetically poor and leaves the possibility of hygienic problems developing. In the case of MAKRO SA stores, the above problems are not acceptable and should be avoided at all costs. The objective of the report is to investigate solutions {{to solve the problem of}} joint damage in industrial floors due to problems occurring in practice, as described below. Floor joint edge problems are a result of three main reasons. First, subsoil quality. The quality of the subsoil is determined by the compaction effort and type of filler materials used, which in turn determine the amount of deflection that will be detected at joint edges. Subgrade quality determines whether deflection of the top concrete layer will occur. Poor compaction and filler material contributes to excessive deflection occurring due to inadequate support of the concrete floor slabs. Water penetration through the floor slab results in the fines of the subsoil being eroded or washed out, resulting in a less dense material, which will deflect under large vehicle and store racking loads. It is concluded that good quality subsoil conditions will result in less deflection and level irregularities of the top concrete floor slab, resulting in less joint damage and spalling. Secondly, the effect of floor and joint workmanship on damage and joint edge spalling. Level irregularities occur due to poor troweling or floating efforts at the joint area. Poor joint edge workmanship results from incorrect formwork removal from the joint wall resulting in a damaged joint edge and additional spalling of the joint to that occurring from wheel load impact.

40|$|Modeling {{heat flow}} in bodies with discontinuities, such as cracks, or with {{inclusions}} that have different thermal properties {{has been a}} very challenging problem. Classical models lead to infinite heat fluxes at the tip of a crack and convergence of numerical methods that approximate solutions to such models have convergence and mesh dependency issues. To remove the difficulties faced by the classical models a novel nonlocal theory is formulated. ^ The new theory starts from the conservation of energy principle and uses the idea of nonlocal heat-transfer between material points. This idea leads to a transient heat transfer model that does not contain spatial derivative and therefore is suitable to easily treat problems with discontinuities in the temperature field, such as the case of insulating cracks. Compared with the peridynamic mechanical model, the thermal peridynamic model is obtained constructively, not postulated. The model can be applied to 1 D, 2 D, and 3 D problems. In the new model, a peridynamic heat flux is defined and it is shown that in the limit of the nonlocal interaction zone going to zero this flux converges to the classical heat flux. A simple method compute the micro-scale parameters in the peridynamic model based on macroscopically measured material parameters is given. A mesh-free discretization method similar to a finite-volume method is used and the details of implementing the nonlocal boundary conditions (both Dirichlet and Neumann) are shown. ^ Convergence studies in the limit of the discrete grid spacing going to zero for a fixed horizon indicate an interesting property of the peridynamic solutions relative to those given by the classical model of transient heat conduction. Numerical experiments allow us to formulate a conjecture in this respect. Convergence studies in terms of the nonlocal region going to zero show that the peridynamic solutions converge, for well-behaved problems, to solutions of the classical, local model. In contrast with the classical model, the new peridynamic model for heat transfer can solve problems with emerging, growing, and merging discontinuities, thus it provides the first such model able to simulate heat transfer in a fracturing body. Examples of thermal heterogeneous inclusions are also shown. The advantages, in this case, compared with a Finite Element Method, for example, rest in the simplicity of discretization. In peridynamics, complex geometry is treated in the same way simple geometries are. ^ The new formulation {{can also be used to}} model heat/mass flow problems in biological systems with complex microstructure, in materials that <b>undergo</b> <b>damage</b> and fragmentation (thermo-mechanical fracture), or in granular systems in motion. ...|$|E
