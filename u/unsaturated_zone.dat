25|$|The <b>unsaturated</b> <b>zone</b> {{can play}} an {{important}} role in retarding (and in some cases eliminating) pathogens and so must be considered when assessing aquifer vulnerability. The biological activity is greatest in the top soil layers where the attenuation of pathogens is generally most effective.|$|E
25|$|Groundwater can {{be found}} at nearly every point in the Earth's shallow {{subsurface}} to some degree, although aquifers do not necessarily contain fresh water. The Earth's crust can be divided into two regions: the saturated zone or phreatic zone (e.g., aquifers, aquitards, etc.), where all available spaces are filled with water, and the <b>unsaturated</b> <b>zone</b> (also called the vadose zone), where there are still pockets of air that contain some water, but can be filled with more water.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree of}} {{pathogen}} removal strongly varies with soil type, aquifer type, distance {{and other environmental}} factors. For example, the <b>unsaturated</b> <b>zone</b> becomes “washed” during extended periods of heavy rain, providing hydraulic pathway for the quick pass of pathogens. It is difficult to estimate the safe distance between a pit latrine or a septic tank and a water source. In any case, such recommendations about the safe distance are mostly ignored by those building pit latrines. In addition, household plots are of a limited size and therefore pit latrines are often built much closer to groundwater wells than what {{can be regarded as}} safe. This results in groundwater pollution and household members falling sick when using this groundwater as a source of drinking water.|$|E

25|$|Unsaturated {{conditions}} occur {{above the}} water table where the pressure head is negative (absolute pressure can never be negative, but gauge pressure can) and the water that incompletely fills the pores of the aquifer material is under suction. The water content in the <b>unsaturated</b> <b>zone</b> is {{held in place by}} surface adhesive forces and it rises {{above the water}} table (the zero-gauge-pressure isobar) by capillary action to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the capillary fringe) at less than atmospheric pressure. This is termed tension saturation and {{is not the same as}} saturation on a water-content basis. Water content in a capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance from the phreatic surface. The capillary head depends on soil pore size. In sandy soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal capillary rise in a clayey soil is less than 1.80 m (six feet) but can range between 0.3 and 10 m (one and 30ft).|$|E

40|$|Natural {{chemical}} and isotopic tracers contained in unsaturated-zone moisture profiles {{are being developed}} as potential new archives for reconstructing recharge history, as well as palaeoclimatic or palaeobotanical conditions over time scales ranging from 20 – 120, 000 years. Results worldwide to date are reviewed, and examples from northern Africa and the western USA are discussed in detail. Encouraging results are obtained from relatively homogeneous deposits such as Quaternary dune sands, where Cl profiles are compared both with the instrumental record, such as rainfall and river-gauging records, and 3 H profiles. Model studies have helped to define the persistence time of unsaturated-zone signals, where evidence of a 20 -year event such as the Sahel drought may persist for 1, 000 years. Significant questions remain regarding the assumptions used in interpreting profiles, particularly {{the extent to which}} preferential flow may occur, transient flow phenomena, and stability of tracer-input function. <b>Unsaturated</b> <b>zones</b> that exhibit strong preferential flow are probably unsuitable as archives. Questions remain also on the assumption that flow remains downward, especially in deep <b>unsaturated</b> <b>zones</b> where non-isothermal vapour transport may occur. Estimation of depositional flux for Cl and other parameters is probably the greatest source of uncertainty, both at the spatial scale and also in the long term. Advances are being made in all areas, however, and the use of multiple tracers (chemical, especially Cl and NO 3) and isotopic signals (δ 18 O, δ 2 H, 36 Cl), together with soil hydraulic properties, is promising for palaeohydrological reconstruction...|$|R
