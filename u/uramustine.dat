50|$|The {{original}} {{nitrogen mustard}} drug, mustine (HN2), {{is no longer}} commonly in use because of excessive toxicity. Other nitrogen mustards developed as treatments include cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, <b>uramustine,</b> ifosfamide, melphalan, and bendamustine. Bendamustine has recently re-emerged as a viable chemotherapeutic treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Uramustine</b> (INN) or uracil mustard is a {{chemotherapy}} drug which {{belongs to}} the class of alkylating agents. It is used in lymphatic malignancies such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It works by damaging DNA, primarily in cancer cells that preferentially take up the uracil due to their need to make nucleic acids during their rapid cycles of cell division. The DNA damage leads to apoptosis of the affected cells. Bone marrow suppression and nausea are the main side effects.|$|E
40|$|The design, synthesis, characterization, DNA binding properties, and {{cytotoxic}} {{activity of}} a novel series of hybrids, namely, a mol. combination of the natural antibiotic distamycin A and the antineoplastic agent <b>uramustine,</b> are reported, and the structure-​activity relationships are discussed. This homologous series 29 -​ 34 consisted of the minor groove binder distamycin A joined to <b>uramustine</b> (uracil mustard) by suitable aliph. carboxylic acid moieties contg. a flexible polymethylene chain that is variable in length (CH 2) ​n, where n = 1 -​ 6. All the hybrid compds. in this series exhibit enhanced activity compared to both distamycin A and <b>uramustine</b> derivs. 22 -​ 27 used for conjugation, giving IC 50 values in the range 7. 26 -​ 0. 07 μM following a 1 h exposure of human leukemic K 562 cells, with maximal activity shown when n = 6. The distance between the <b>uramustine</b> and distamycin frame is crucial for the cytotoxicity, with compds. having linker lengths of four to six being at least 20 -​fold more cytotoxic than liker lengths one to three. Taq polymerase stop expts. demonstrated selective covalent binding of uramustine-​distamycin hybrids to A​/T rich DNA sequences, which was again more efficient with compds. 32 -​ 34 with a longer linker length. Two consequences {{can be derived from}} our study: (a) the distamycin moiety directs binding to the minor groove of A​/T rich DNA sequences and, consequently, is responsible for the alkylation regioselectivity found in footprinting studies; (b) the higher flexibility due to a longer linker between the distamycin and uracil moieties allows the formation of complexes with the mustard moiety situated more deeply in the minor groove and, hence, with better alkylating properties...|$|E
