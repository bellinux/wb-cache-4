50|$|Interstate 240 (I-240) is a 9.1 mi long Interstate Highway loop in the U.S. {{state of}} North Carolina. It {{serves as an}} <b>urban</b> <b>connector</b> for Asheville and runs in a half-circle around {{the north of the}} city's {{downtown}} district between exits 53B and 46B of Interstate 40. Between those points, I-40 continues in an east-west direction further south of the city, roughly parallel to the Swannanoa and French Broad rivers. The western segment of I-240 is now being co-signed with I-26 {{as part of a larger}} project extending I-26 from its former western terminus at I-40/I-240 to U.S. Route 23 (US 23) near Kingsport, Tennessee.|$|E
40|$|The 20 th century's {{notion of}} a {{skyscraper}} in Manhattan, a symbolic object aloof from a city, should be redefined due to the reinterpretation of the grid to accommodate more public amenity and facilitate the cultural contexts of Manhattan. These Days, pedestrian plazas, transportation infrastructure, and zoning resolution have given individuality to {{each part of the}} grid which used to be seemingly identical with little public provision. Especially, Mid-Manhattan shows this tendency clearly. Pedestrian activity and cultural programs of Theater District and Times Square has infiltrated into the strict grid and created Mid-Manhattan's own public realm. In this regard, given the grid's capacity for reinvention, how might architecture continue to adapt and response to today's new change? Defying the conventional typology of a skyscraper, a stack of individual programs, the thesis is aiming to reimagine the typology of a skyscraper to address the building's relationship with the urban fabric and respond to the existing street life and culture. Finally, the thesis proposes a skyscraper as an <b>urban</b> <b>connector,</b> by virtue of rethinking of circulation and structure. This new type of a skyscraper supports the multiple strata of public space and cultural programs, such as a theater and a museum, to extend existing urban contexts, art and performance, of Mid-Manhattan, not only at street level but into the sky above. Also, as an urban-scale strategy, the project also seeks to interconnect the dense grid with vertical structures with the most dominant public realm in Manhattan, Central Park, through a 3 dimensionally manipulated building form. by Jae Kyung Kim.

40|$|Rising {{water levels}} {{threaten}} {{the existence of}} many coastal cities throughout the world, including Lower Manhattan, which {{is in danger of}} sea level rise by as much as six feet {{by the end of the}} century! Higher sea levels mean that larger storms will occur with greater frequency. Assuming that humanity does not reverse its current ecological contribution, barriers to stop rising waters will not be adequate. Manhattan is covered by 50 feet of water, transforming New York into a new Venice. The substantial bedrock of the city provides a hefty foundation capable of supporting Manhattan’s structures for many years to come. However, the water scrubs away the ground plane, requiring a new, elevated plane of existence. A porous, artificial island structure provides connections between the stranded, free-standing structures. The layers of the city are pulled apart and re-conceptualized as <b>urban</b> <b>connectors,</b> providing multiple points of movement and occupiable space. The city provides multiple ground planes to create a style of living that truly occupies all three dimensions, and not one that is tied to a singular ground plane...|$|R

40|$|The {{premise of}} this thesis {{is to use}} a large volume {{in order to create a}} public space, a new city scape in a city park. The focus of the thesis {{proposal}} is on the ability of an urban site project to resonate beyond the imposed limits of a park (the "Esplanade") caught in between the Charles River and the busy express way of Storrow Drive in Boston. The aim is to integrate the large-scale sports complex into a cityscape which can thus evolve positively whilst respecting the skyline of Boston and the surrounding city. The study attempts to design an Olympic Velodrome (indoor cycling arena that will be one of the vendors or the bidding of the Boston Olympics in the year 2008), in an urban setting park on the Charles River edge(meeting point of the Atlantic Ocean) without destroying the life of the town, its physical presence should accompany it. The urban question posed by the velodrome facility project involves presence and absence. The Velodrome's juxtaposition with the public space reexamines the space of transition, which is caught in between the public (spectators) and private (athletes) realms. Using the Velodrome as a point of departure, the proposal seeks to develop an architecture that functions simultaneously as both an <b>urban</b> <b>connector</b> for public (runners, rollerbladers, cyclers, etc) and a localizing element that enables the re-definition of the movement in free-form landscape. This proposal operates at urban, architectural, and bodily scales to provide a forum of exploration. Formally, the architectural configuration seeks to come bet-ween the meta-morphosis of the surrounding landscape topography, suggesting an alternative contextualism that maintains a specific relationship to the water-front and the city, while emerging as a unique and discrete relationship of speed, time, and precision driven Velodrome. The goal of the design will be to resolve the large scale standard dimensions of the velodrome and how the architecture can negotiate between the private (velodrome) and public recreational activities generated by the speed driven program.

40|$|The recent {{launching}} in Italy of {{a number}} of large scale urban operations centered around High Speed Railway (HSR) stations has added a wealth of examples and themes to the overall European picture; these go to make up a global point of reference for other countries that are, in this period, undertaking the construction of their own HSR networks. Above and beyond the territorial questions often linked to the issue, further research investigating the architectural aspect of these operations would be highly relevant, but is rather lacking. Instead, we shall be focusing on current HSR stations in Italy, such as Turin Porta Susa, Florence Belfiore and Rome Tiburtina, and comparing them briefly, where necessary, with European case-studies, whilst directing our attention towards certain aspects that still need to be examined. A key element in past studies (Castells: 2000; Harvey: 1989; Hall: 2002) is that contemporary railway operations should be assessed on a city-regional scale. Indeed, focusing on Italian HSR stations, which readapt existing railway stations to HSR use, the importance of the local scale suddenly emerges, since it is through these buildings that the urban residual, pre-existing conditions, due to the 19 th and 20 th century infrastructure, are now being integrated into larger Master Plans, in which the railway station acts as the primary integer of urban and architectural space. However, replacing these contemporary HSR stations within an architectural framework raises a major question at the district level, about the impact of these huge complexes on the ancient urban fabric and about their new role as urban mediators, also in terms of density and morphology. Finally, addressing specific factors in the design process, this paper aims to describe and illustrate the peculiar features through which HSR infrastructure today manages to transform itself from the urban separator that it was during the last century into an <b>urban</b> <b>connector.</b> This paper concludes by providing two main scenarios that might contribute {{to our understanding of the}} spatiality of these new HSR stations, and attempts to show that HSR stations may be seen as an interface, whose main qualities become those of exchange, adaptability and compatibility; this would call for a more complex association between flows and urban matter, focusing more on the relationships between objects than on the objects themselves...|$|E
40|$|Planning and {{designing}} based on networks and nodes {{can be seen}} best in the bub of a railway station. The railway station area of Leiden Central must be redeveloped to incorporate a new light rail line. Therefore the station is changing, both as a node in the network of public transport and as {{a place in the}} city next to the historical centre. In this light Bertolini (Bertolini and Spit, 1998) has developed the node-place model. A balance between node and place-elements create a good working urban transport and land use system. Peek (2006) elaborates this with the types Transportation node, <b>Connector,</b> <b>Urban</b> centre and Meeting place. These perspectives equally balanced contribute to creating a coherence of node and place-elements which can lead to an increase in value. (Peek, 2006, Location synergy) The Master Thesis focuses on these four perspectives to redesign the station area in its urban layout. First they are used to compare similar station area in the network of High Speed Trains {{in the form of a}} case study and than it gives a vision to the station area of Leiden in a design as a strong urban place with a lively public space.

40|$|The Walled City Of Old Delhi {{serves as}} the heart of {{metropolitan}} Delhi. The city is a complex amalgamation of Mughal, Colonial and post Colonial architecture. This overlap {{has resulted in a}} rich urban fabric and networked cultural urbanism. This provides the city it’s personality traits, which can be defined as it’s urbanity. The thesis aims to decode the microcosm of this urbanity, which can be understood {{as the result of a}} morphogenesis that is generated by boundary conditions, a densely packed fabric and <b>urban</b> attractors and <b>connectors.</b> This investigation attempts to extract the spatial and cultural codes of Old Delhi using parametric tools to analyze the changing sets of relationships that govern its architectural growth and development. These codes serve as parameters that define the shape of the city’s fabric. The first act in this process is the Database Step-this critical part is simply the recording and translation of the informal types of settlements— into architectural and urban maps and drawings so that they can be analyzed. The recording of acts, processes and their resultant architectures and the urban fabric that they constitute are considered to be invisible as they are not ‘legitimated’ by formal civic processes but rather are embodied in the lives, activities and culture of a community and embodied in the urban fabric that surrounds them. This narrative description is then supported by the extraction and development of parametric urban codes through Grasshopper scripts and manual design iterations representing a series of algorithmic morphological conditions. These codes can generate typologies and exhibit the relationship between the communal and larger infrastructure to give the user a material sense of the cultural world. The preservation of historic centers and its embedded urbanism is an important question of urban design. The planning department and organizations pay primary attention to the heritage sites instead of understanding and preserving its embedded spatial codes. Hence, the goal of this thesis is to address the need for a planning model that illustrates the framework of the residential settlements of historic cities that are undergoing rapid transformation or are under process for redevelopment to architects, planners and organizations involved in urban development. This model provides sets of rules and values that anticipate design solutions that can act as a paradigmatic model for Old Delhi and other historic cities thereby facilitating the preservation of its cultural and architectural urbanity...|$|R
