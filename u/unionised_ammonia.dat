30|$|In polyculture, both <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> {{and carbon}} dioxide are {{strongly}} correlated with pH suggesting that the inclusion of C. gariepinus enhances production of ammonia. As stated earlier in this study, C. gariepinus is an efficient producer of ammonia. These observations {{were made in the}} daytime when carbon dioxide was kept low by photosynthetic activity. Carbon dioxide for both systems was relatively higher in the night than in the day; the opposite was the case for <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia.</b> The influence of carbon dioxide on pH is relatively strong in the night than in the day under monoculture condition. The opposite is the case for polyculture where the relationship is strong in the day than in the night. The relationship between <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> {{and carbon dioxide}} shows that under polyculture condition, <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> decreases with increasing carbon dioxide. The presence of high amount of carbon dioxide lowers pH, which eventually increases H+ ions that can combine with <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> to form less toxic NH 4 +.|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} shows that there is diurnal {{difference}} in the way ammonia and carbon dioxide interact and pH is a manifestation of their interaction. <b>Unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> in monoculture increased with pH during the day, while carbon dioxide remained constant, implying that the driving factor for changes in <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> may not be carbon dioxide. During the day, pH was high because most of the CO 2 was consumed during photosynthesis. This condition allowed <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> to dominate in the system (Grant 2010). It was noted previously in this discussion that the <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> is {{only a fraction of the}} total ammonia present and its toxicity is pH dependent. Thus, the higher portion of toxic ammonia was found at higher pH levels which normally occur during the day.|$|E
30|$|The {{levels of}} free carbon dioxide (0.84 – 1.67  mg/l) {{recorded}} {{in this study}} are notably lower than the tolerable levels (1 – 10  mg/l) in aquaculture pond waters (Boyd and Tucker 1998). Carbon dioxide rarely causes direct toxicity to fish; however its high concentrations lower pond pH and limit the capacity of fish blood to carry oxygen by lowering blood pH at the gills (Grant 2010; Wurts and Durborow 1992). Furthermore, carbon dioxide and hence pH influence <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> levels. The former is an essential factor required for the photosynthesis process. During the night, photosynthesis is halted while respiration proceeds at low rate causing relatively constant levels of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia,</b> carbon dioxide and hence pH for both monoculture and polyculture systems. Clearly, during the day photosynthesis depletes carbon dioxide allowing high pH and thus elevated levels of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> to exist in both systems. As revealed in this study, management of ammonia toxicity in a polyculture system employing a predatory fish such as C. gariepinus is relatively more crucial than in O. niloticus monoculture system.|$|E
30|$|Ammonia is {{the most}} {{important}} water quality parameter that affects fish growth and production after dissolved oxygen. It causes stress and damages gills and other tissues, even in small amounts (Francis-Floyd et al. 2009). The present study showed that <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> increased both during the day and night. However, the rate of increase was lower during the day than night. The levels of 0.08 – 0.26  mg/l for <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> reported in this study are much higher than 0.05 – 0.1  mg/l recommended for aquaculture pond waters (Boyd 1990; Boyd and Tucker 1998; Francis-Floyd et al. 2009) and the levels of 0.002 – 0.026  mg/l reported by Alam and Al-Hafedh (2006). However, {{the results of the present}} study are corroborated by findings of Oz′orio et al. (2001).|$|E
30|$|The {{higher levels}} of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> {{reported}} from polyculture than monoculture system {{in the present study}} could be attributed to the presence of African sharp tooth catfish (C. gariepinus) in polyculture treatments. The argument is logical because catfish being a carnivore (Groenewald 1964) is considered as a predator in polyculture, targeting fish fry and fingerlings (Ibrahim and El Naggar 2010). Apparently, carnivorous fish excrete more ammonia than herbivorous fish such as tilapia (Ibrahim and El Naggar 2010). The present findings suggest that polyculture farmers can achieve relatively higher fish growth and production through maintaining acceptable levels of water quality parameters, particularly <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia.</b> This can be done by replacing some amount of water with freshwater into the ponds on a weekly basis.|$|E
30|$|Generally, {{the levels}} of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> from both systems were higher than the {{acceptable}} levels for aquaculture (Table  2), though with no significant difference among sampling hours (ANOVA, F =  1.238, P >  0.05, df =  5) {{as well as between}} culture systems (t = − 0.229, P >  0.05, df =  34) (Table  3).|$|E
30|$|Farmers should {{monitor the}} fish feeding {{behaviour}} and feed them {{only when the}} feed supplied is consumed. However, {{in the present study}} farmers did not monitor the feeding behaviour of the fish during feeding which may have contributed to accumulation of uneaten feed in the ponds. Consequently, accumulation of uneaten feed might have contributed to higher levels of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> observed from the present study. Thus, the higher levels of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> imply that most fish farms in Tanzania may have an elevated level of this parameter. To avoid this problem, fish should not be overfed and whoever feeds the fish must be sure that the feed offered can be completely consumed. This is both for practical and economic importance, since feed costs are a major portion of production costs in aquaculture operations (Durborow et al. 1997).|$|E
30|$|The {{present results}} have {{revealed}} diurnal variations in water quality parameters with peak values occurring {{during the afternoon}} to pre-sunset and the lowest from midnight to pre-dawn hours. The lower amount of DO in polyculture {{was caused by the}} combined effect of consumption by the two species than in monoculture. Of all the measured water quality parameters, <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> is the most critical and needs to be strictly monitored. Although most water quality parameters were within the recommended limits and did not affect the growth of the cultured fish, normally changes of one parameter affects the state of others. Thus, for maximum fish growth, survival and higher yields, fish farmers are advised to regularly monitor water quality parameters, particularly <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> to ensure that they are within the acceptable range. The monitoring should be done late in the evening and early in the morning owing to low values recorded.|$|E
30|$|In most {{aquaculture}} systems, {{the controlling}} factor for pH {{is the relationship}} among photosynthesis, carbon dioxide (CO 2) and the bicarbonate (HCO 3 −) buffering system. In the night, respiration by bacteria, aquatic animals and plants results in dissolved oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Carbon dioxide produced combines with water molecules to produce carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3), which then dissociates into bicarbonate (HCO 3 −) and hydrogen ions (H+); the increase in H+ concentrations lowers the pH. During the day, plants consume carbon dioxide while undergoing photosynthesis. The removal of carbon dioxide from the water causes bicarbonate and carbonate ions to react with hydrogen ions (H+) forming more carbon dioxide. This loss of H+ from the water causes the pH to increase. In turn, the dynamics {{of carbon dioxide and}} pH influence the levels of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia,</b> whereby elevated carbon dioxide concentrations and hence low pH result in higher levels of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia.</b> These dynamics have been explained by Wurts and Durborow (1992) and Wurts (2002).|$|E
30|$|The {{levels of}} nitrite–nitrogen and nitrate–nitrogen from both {{monoculture}} and polyculture treatments ranged from 0.001 to 0.009  mg/l. These sources of nitrogen {{are products of}} ammonia oxidation. While nitrite–nitrogen is not as toxic as <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia,</b> it is {{harmful to aquatic organisms}} and must be removed from the system. The reported findings are much lower than the 96 -h median lethal concentration of 81 and 8  mg/l recommended for small and large O. niloticus, respectively (Atwood et al. 2001). The present levels are also within the recommended limits of less than 0.3 and 0.2 – 10  mg/l for nitrite–nitrogen and nitrate–nitrogen, respectively, for aquaculture pond waters (Boyd and Tucker 1998).|$|E
40|$|In {{regions of}} the world with poor {{provision}} of wastewater treatment, raw sewage is often discharged directly into surface waters. This paper describes an experimental evaluation of the fate of two organic chemicals under these conditions using an artificial channel cascade fed with a mix of settled sewage and river water at its upstream end and operated under continuous steady-state conditions. The experiments underpin an environmental risk assessment methodology based on the idea of an “impact zone” (IZ) – the zone downstream of wastewater emission in which water quality is severely impaired by high concentrations of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia,</b> nitrite and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Radiolabelled dodecane- 6 -benzene sulphonate (DOBS) and aniline hydrochloride were used as the model chemical and reference compound respectively. Rapid changes in 14 C counts were observed with flow-time for both these materials. These changes were most likely to be due to complete mineralisation. A dissipation half-life of approximately 7. 1 h was observed for the 14 C label with DOBS. The end of the IZ was defined as {{the point at which the}} concentration of both <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> and nitrite fell below their respective predicted no-effect concentrations for salmonids. At these points in the cascade, approximately 83 and 90 % of the initial concentration of 14 C had been removed from the water column, respectively. A simple model of mineral nitrogen transformations based on Michaelis–Menten kinetics was fitted to observed concentrations of NH 4, NO 2 and NO 3. The cascade is intended to provide a confirmatory methodology for assessing the ecological risks of chemicals under direct discharge co...|$|E
30|$|Two-way {{analysis}} of variance (ANOVA) {{was used to evaluate}} any significant differences in water quality parameters among different sampling hours. Post hoc analysis was done by using Tukey HSD test (Zar 1999). The significance of difference in <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia,</b> carbon dioxide and pH was determined using 95  % confidence intervals plotted as error bars. Growth performance parameters and the difference in water quality parameters between culture systems were tested using two-sample t test. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 13 for Windows (Landau and Everit 2004). Significant differences were judged at a probability level of P <  0.05 (Zar 1999). The means of all individual values of water quality parameters are presented with the standard error of the mean (SEM).|$|E
30|$|The overall {{performance}} of an aquaculture system is partly determined by its water quality parameters. Poor water quality stresses and adversely affects fish growth causing low production, profit and product quality. Diurnal dynamics of water quality parameters were investigated in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) monoculture and polyculture with Clarias gariepinus in earthen ponds. Dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH were measured and monitored for 24  h. Water samples for nutrient analysis {{were collected from}} the middle of ponds in triplicate at about 30 – 35  cm below the water surface using a plastic bottle. Nitrite–nitrogen (NO 2 –N), nitrate–nitrogen (NO 3 –N), <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> (NH 3 –N), soluble reactive phosphorus and free carbon dioxide were analysed following standard methods and procedures. The results show that dissolved oxygen concentrations during the past midnight and pre-dawn hours were significantly lower than the levels in the morning and afternoon hours (ANOVA, F =  45.709, P <  0.05) which is dangerous {{to the life of the}} cultured fishes. The levels of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> and temperature were higher and lower, respectively, than the acceptable levels for optimum growth of O. niloticus and C. gariepinus. Nitrite–nitrogen, nitrate–nitrogen, pH, soluble reactive phosphorus and free carbon dioxide were within the recommended limits for fish growth in aquaculture. Growth parameters, feed conversion ratio and survival rate were not significantly different between culture systems (P >  0.05). Fish yield was relatively higher in polyculture (45.74  ±  0.44  tons/ha) than monoculture (30.77  ±  0.54  tons/ha). During fish farming, optimum fish growth and hence economic benefits can be accrued by devoting some efforts on monitoring the fish pond water at regular intervals. This quality assurance process will ensure that fish farmers produce fish with maximum growth and yield without polluting pond water and the surrounding environment.|$|E
30|$|Growth {{performance}} and daily water quality parameters, survival rate, yield and daily nutrients {{are shown in}} Table  3. The final mean weight was significantly higher in fish cultured in polyculture than monoculture (t = − 3.095, P >  0.05, df =  4) (Table  3). Similarly, fish yield was relatively higher in polyculture (45.74  ±  0.44  tons/ha) than monoculture (30.77  ±  0.54  tons/ha). There {{was no significant difference}} in DWG (t = − 0.465, P >  0.05, df =  14), SGR (t = − 0.173, P >  0.05, df =  14), FCR (t = − 0.546, P >  0.05, df =  14) and survival rate (t =  2.535, P >  0.05, df =  4) between monoculture and polyculture systems (Table  3). With the exception of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia,</b> temperature, pH and free carbon dioxide did not differ during the study period and remained in the favourable range for growth and survival of O. niloticus and C. gariepinus (Table  3).|$|E
30|$|The {{principal}} metabolic {{waste product}} of fish is ammonia, {{which is the}} major source of ammonia in pond water. Ammonia occurs in two forms in water, which together are referred to as total ammonia nitrogen (TAN). TAN is composed of ionised ammonia (NH 4 +) and <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> (UIA or NH 3 –N) of which the latter is the most toxic form of ammonia to fish (Francis-Floyd et al. 2009). Principally, in healthy fish ponds the levels of ammonia should always be zero. Otherwise, any presence of ammonia in fish ponds such as that reported in the present study is a sign that the system may be running out of control (Francis-Floyd et al. 2009). Exposure of fish to even low levels of ammonia over time makes them susceptible to bacterial infections, have poor growth and will not tolerate routine handling procedures (Francis-Floyd et al. 2009). Poor fish pond management including water quality was reported to have contributed to low fish pond yields in the Lake Victoria basin, Tanzania (Shoko et al. 2011).|$|E
40|$|Waste {{from the}} leather industry, known as limed leather {{fleshing}} (LF), {{has a low}} C:N (3. 2) and an alkaline pH of 11. 4. This is a major disadvantage for anaerobic digestion due to ammonia toxicity for methanogenesis. This study describes co-digestion of LF with biodegradable fraction of municipal solids waste optimised over a range of C:N and pH to minimise ammonia and to maximise biogas yield. The optimum conditions were found with a blend that provided C:N of 15 and pH of 6. 5 and the cumulative biogas yield increased from 560 mL using LF fraction alone, to 6518 mL with optimum blend. At higher pH of 8. 5, <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> was high (2473 mg L(- 1)) coincided with poor biogas yield (47 m Ld(- 1)) that confirms ammonia toxicity. By contrast at a pH of 4. 5 the ammonia was minimum (510 mg L(- 1)), but high VFA (26, 803 mg L(- 1)) inhibited the methanogens. Biomass activity measured using ATP correlated well with biogas yield as reported previously...|$|E
40|$|Inadequate seed {{production}} {{has historically been}} a factor limiting the commercial culture of Clarias gariepinus. The need to determine the environmental requirements of larvae was identified, {{in order to facilitate}} their successful mass rearing in hatcheries. The effects of key environmental factors on the growth, survival and aspects of the behaviour of C. gariepinus larvae and juveniles were investigated under controlled conditions. A strong emphasis was placed on the interpretation of the observed responses in terms of the natural history of the animal. Larvae were obtained by artificially inducing and spawning feral adult broodfish. Larval growth rates were highest in the temperature range 26 - 33 ºC, with a peak at 30 ºC. Survival of larvae was high between 22 and 33 ºC. The final temperature preferendum of juveniles, determined in a thermal gradient was 30 ºC, and it was concluded that this temperature is probably optimal for most of the physiological processes of the animal. Larvae and juveniles displayed strong negative phototaxis. When reared under different photoperiod regimes, larval growth increased with longer dark periods, however a similar rate of mortality was recorded in all photoperiod treatments. The provision of cover was found to enhance larval growth under conditions of continual light (24 L/OD), however under conditions of continual darkness (OL/ 24 D) similar growth rates were recorded regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} cover. All growth rates in continual darkness (OL/ 24 D) were higher than those in continual light (24 L/OD), regardless of whether cover was provided or not. It was concluded that a OL/ 24 D photoperiod is optimal for larval rearing. At salinities between 0 and 5 % similar growth and mortality rates of larvae were recorded. At 7. 5 % larval growth and survival rates were lower, and at 10 % all larvae died within 48 hours. The 96 h-LCSO for <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> was found to be 2. 3 mg/l. The cytological effects of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> were evident as degenerative changes in the gill and liver tissues. In an investigation of tank hygiene, it was found that larval growth and survival rates were highest in tanks not cleaned at all. As the frequency of tank cleaning increased, the growth and survival rates of larvae decreased. When reared at densities ranging from 45 - 450 / 1, larval growth was found to be density dependent. A model of hatchery productivity (number larvae of standard size produced/time/vol.) was developed based on the density dependent nature of larval growth. The model predicts that maximum productivity, will be achieved at a rearing density of 1400 / 1. The high growth and survival rates obtained over a broad range of each environmental parameter investigated serve to explain how larvae survive and grow in their unstable floodplain habitat in nature. The broad environmental tolerances of C. gariepinus are of benefit with respect to the culture of larvae, as successful larval rearing is possible over a fairly wide range of environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|Natural England is {{responsible}} for overseeing the management and assessment of sites with national and international designations for wildlife, including Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and Special Areas of Conservation (SACs). A key aspect of this work {{is the definition of}} Conservation Objectives for each site, that define favourable conditions and inform management decisions relating to the site. The purpose of this report is to review key quantitative information on the response of the characteristic biological community of river types in England and the UK to organic pollution stress gradients, in order to reconsider the adequacy of the targets set for protecting SSSI condition. The stress under consideration here is the toxic effect caused either directly or indirectly by organic pollution, not the effect of increased nutrient loading. Organic pollution can result in oxygen depletion and increased ammonia concentrations with severe consequences for river organisms. Organic effluents frequently contain large quantities of suspended solids which reduce the light available and alter river bed characteristics rendering it unsuitable for many organisms. Objective quantitative information on the sensitivity of river organisms to organic pollution has been derived using different approaches, carefully controlled laboratory assessments (e. g. LC 50), field scale experimental manipulations, case histories and correlation of field survey data. The different approaches vary in the degree of control and realism. Evidence available {{from a variety of sources}} is reviewed and the reponse of the biological community to determinands associated with organic pollution presented. Fish are particularly prone to the toxic effects of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> and of oxygen stress. Both <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> and oxygen stress can cause death of invertebrates, but they are typically less sensitive to ammonia than fish. Field scale simulated pollution events and exposure to polluted natural waters indicate that, whilst laboratory trials provide an indication of sensitivity, they do not accurately reflect the response of organisms in the field. New analyses of field data were undertaken at both family and species level to determine the response of macroinvertebrates to organic pollution. The approach was to develop a ranking of taxa based on their tolerance to organic pollution, as measured by a combination of BOD, oxygen and ammonium concentration based on partial ordination. Infrequent taxa were included in the analyses passively, to give an indication of their sensitivity without biasing the results. The three macroinvertebrate families most sensitive to organic pollution were identified as Odontoceridae, Goeridae and Rhyacophilidae (incl. Glossosomatidae). The species level analysis was compromised by a lack of data from more polluted sites. It is recommended that more species level data are collected from organically polluted sites before a repeat of this analysis is attempted. Management thresholds of organic pollution for SSSIs should be able to protect the most sensitive taxa characteristic of the habitat, and correspondingly thresholds should differ among sites according to the fauna. The tolerance of the most sensitive taxa typically present can then be used to establish the thresholds for each river type. RIVPACS 9 -endgroup river types predict the fauna and mean abundance in such rivers; these were matched to NE (and JNCC) river types.

40|$|A {{physiological}} {{study was}} carried out {{to determine the effects}} of temperature, quantity of food fed, feeding activity and size class on the oxygen consumption and ammonia production of the South African abalone Haliotis midae L [...] A set of intermittent flow respirometer chambers were used in a recirculating system to measure the oxygen consumption rates of fed (postprandial) and unfed (postabsorptive) abalone for three different size classes (15, 30, and 50 mm) at three different temperatures (16 °, 20 ° and 23 °C) over a 24 hour period. Ammonia production rates and food consumption rates were simultaneously determined. Oxygen consumption and Ammonia production rates per gram abalone were linear functions of abalone size, temperature, and mass of food consumed. Oxygen consumption and ammonia production rates were found to increase proportionally to temperature and in inverse proportion to abalone size. These rates were significantly higher for fed as opposed to unfed abalone. Equations were derived to predict oxygen consumption and ammonia production for fed and unfed animals for a range of temperatures and size classes of abalone. A 96 h LC 50 lethal toxicity test for exposure to ammonia established 1. 08 mg. 1 · 1 of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> as the lethal limit.

Salinity tolerance {{of this species}} ranges from 0. 4 – 1. 4 ‰ to 65. 2 – 75. 4 ‰. Within 2 – 50 ‰ salinity, Moina mongolica can complete its life cycle through parthenogenesis. The optimum temperature is between 25 ◦C and 28 ◦C, while it tolerates high temperature between 34. 4 ◦C and 36. 0 ◦C and lower temperature between 3. 2 ◦C and 5. 4 ◦C. The non-toxic level of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> (24 h LC 50) for M. mongolica is < 2. 6 mg NH 3 –N l− 1. Juvenile individuals filter 2. 37 ml d− 1 and feed 9. 45 × 106 algal cells d− 1, while mature individuals filter 9. 45 ml d− 1 and consume 4. 94 × 106 algal cells d− 1. At 28 ◦C, M. mongolica reaches sex maturity in 4 d and gives birth once a day afterward; females carry 7. 3 eggs brood− 1 and spawn 2. 8 times during their lifetime.

40|$|Several {{techniques}} {{are available for}} dealing with the waste sludge produced in biological waste water treatment. A biological approach uses aquatic worms to consume and partially digest the waste sludge. In our concept for a worm reactor, the worms (Lumbriculus variegatus) are immobilised in a carrier material. For correct sizing and operation of such a worm reactor, the effect of changes in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, ammonia concentration, temperature and light exposure were studied in sequencing batch experiments. DO concentration had an effect on both sludge consumption rate and sludge reduction efficiency. Sludge consumption rate was four times higher at DO concentrations above 8. 1 mg/L, when compared to DO concentrations below 2. 5 mg/L. Sludge reduction was 36 and 77 % at these respective DO concentrations. The effect is most likely the result of a difference in gut residence time. An increase in <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> concentration drastically decreased the consumption rate. Ammonia is released by the worms at a rate of 0. 02 mg N/mg TSS digested; therefore, replacing the effluent in the worm reactor is required to maintain a low ammonia concentration. The highest sludge consumption rates were measured at a temperature around 15 °C, whilst the highest TSS reduction was achieved at 10 °C. Not exposing the worms to light did not affect consumption or digestion rates. High temperatures (above 25 °C) as well as low DO concentrations (below 1 mg/L) in the worm reactor should be avoided as these lead to significant decreases in the number of worms. The main challenges for applying the worm reactor at a larger scale are the supply of oxygen to the worms and maintaining a low ammonia concentration in the worm reactor. Applying a worm reactor at a waste water treatment plant was estimated to increase the oxygen consumption and the ammonia load by 15 ¿ 20 % and 5 % respectively...|$|E
40|$|Juvenile {{salmonids}} inhabit a hypoosmotic {{environment and}} continuously lose salts by diffusion and gain water by osmosis. Even in recently hatched yolk sac fry (or alevins), achievement of hydromineral balance is by absorption of inorganic ions from the medium, possibly via mitochondrion rich cells {{on the body}} surface while excess water is excreted via the kidney. Alevins and fry drink freshwater, and although drinking has no obvious physiological function, it represents a route for water uptake, {{as well as for}} uptake of substances from the environment. Toxic substances in the water may enter directly via the body surface if they are sufficiently lipid-soluble, e. g. organic substances and <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia.</b> Some toxins may inhibit ionic absorption processes in ion absorbing cells on the body surface, e. g. zinc, cadmium and the ammonium ion. Drinking represents another means of toxin presentation, with absorption via the gut mucosa, though little is known of this route, or its significance. Cyanobacteria (blue green algae) produce a variety of toxins in fresh water, including neurotoxins and endotoxins and one group of cyclic peptides, the microcystins which are hepatotoxins, has been extensively studied in mammals. Following ingestion, symptoms include vomiting and diarrhoea followed by damage to liver parenchyma cells, which may be fatal. There have been fewer studies in fish and long term-exposure of brown trout to microcys in resulted in reduced growth rate and liver damage (Bury et al 1995). Microcystins are not sufficiently lipid soluble to enter via the body surface, but may enter via drinking and transport mechanisms in the gut (Bury et al 1997).

40|$|To protect {{tropical}} aquatic ecosystems, {{water quality}} guidelines (WQGs) are often derived based on toxicity data of chemical contaminants using temperate species as surrogates {{because there is}} a lack of such toxicity data from tropical species. Such adoptions of temperate information could result in an unknown safety margin and might lead to over- or under-protection of tropical ecosystems. Therefore, this study systematically compared differences in chemical sensitivities between temperate and tropical aquatic species using the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach. Temperate and tropical saltwater species displayed different sensitivities for ten chemicals but showed similarity towards cadmium. Temperate saltwater species were more sensitive to <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> (NH 3), chromium, lead, nickel and tributyltin, whereas tropical saltwater species were more sensitive to copper, mercury, zinc, pentachlorophenol and phenol. Temperate freshwater species were more sensitive to arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, zinc, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, DDT, lindane and malathion than their tropical counterparts, while tropical freshwater species tended to be more sensitive to 〖NH〗_ 3, lead, chlordane and phenol. Extrapolation factors of two and five were recommended for deriving tropical WQGs from temperate information to protect tropical saltwater and freshwater ecosystems, respectively. The results also indicated a general declining trend in chemical sensitivities from algae to crustaceans, molluscs, worms, and then fishes for both freshwater and saltwater. Both algae and crustaceans are sensitive to diverse chemicals and hence suitable for toxicity testing. Since temperature and pH can influence the physicochemical properties, bioavailability and thus toxicity of a chemical to aquatic organisms, the second part of this study aimed to investigate the relationships between chemical toxicity and temperature or pH. The acute median lethal or effective concentrations of 13 chemicals and 10 metals/metalloids towards various freshwater species were compared among different temperature and pH groups, respectively. The results suggested that in most cases, freshwater species exhibited the highest tolerance towards chemicals at an optimal temperature (T_opt) where the chemical toxicity was the lowest, and the chemical toxicity increased with increasing or decreasing temperature from T_opt). As reflected by SSDs at different temperatures for seven chemicals, the relationship between chemical toxicity and temperature followed the same pattern at the community level. At individual species level, relationships between metal toxicity and pH were more variable and could be classified into three models: (1) decreasing toxicity with increasing pH, (2) increasing toxicity with increasing pH, and (3) minimal toxicity at optimal pH (〖pH〗_opt), with increasing toxicity as pH increases or decreases from 〖pH〗_opt. As reflected by SSDs at different pH values for four metals, the relationship between chemical toxicity and pH conformed to the model (1) at the community level. With these conceptual models revealed in this study, it is feasible to derive site- and seasonal-specific WQGs at different temperature or pH conditions. The present results will be useful to environmental authorities for developing WQGs and conducting risk assessment in order to safeguard valuable tropical aquatic ecosystems and unique biodiversity therein.

A morphometric, meristic and karyological study showed that the hybrid shared some of the physical characteristics of both C. gariepinus and H. longifilis, while its chromosome complement and fundamental number (2 N = 54, FN = 95), was intermediate between that of H. longifilis (2 N = 52, FN = 92) and C. gariepinus (2 N = 56, FN = 97). The HLxCG cross could therefore be regarded as a true hybrid. For the characters tested, no morphological or karyological differences were apparent between the HLxCG hybrids produced in West Africa and those produced in southern Africa. In southern Africa, the HL♂xCG♀ cross had higher fertilization and hatching rates than pure strain H. longifilis, C. gariepinus or the reverse cross. There was no difference in the survival of the ` hybrid larvae and C. gariepinus larvae up to the onset of exogenous feeding. Pure strain H. longifilis juveniles had a faster growth rate than the H. longifilis ♂ x C. gariepinus ♀ juveniles, but the hybrid always grew at a faster rate than C. gariepinus or the reverse cross. The HL♂xCG♀ cross was consequently chosen as the hybrid with the greatest potential for siluroid aquaculture in southern Africa. The HL♂xCG♀ hybrid showed evidence of partial gonadic, gametic and post-zygotic sterility in both sexes. The hybrid was not completely sterile, as it was artificially induced to spawn, and a small number of viable F₂ hybrid and F₁ hybrid x C. gariepinus larvae were produced. However, in the light of its probable reproductive strategy, it is highly unlikely that the hybrid would pose an ecological risk to the southern African region. The H. longifllis ♂ x C. gariepinus ♀ hybrid was compared to C. gariepinus for selected water quality preferences and tolerances. The hybrid had a wider temperature preference (28 °C to 34 °C) than C. gariepinus (28 °C to 30 °C), but appeared to be more dependent on aerial respiration than C. gariepinus. The air-breathing frequency of hybrid fish began to increase at dissolved oxygen concentrations below 3. 8 mg. ℓ·', while C. gariepinus only showed an increase in air-breathing frequency at concentrations below 3. 8 mg. ℓ·'. The hybrid was more tolerant of <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> (96 -hour LC₆₀ = 9. 1 mg. t·') than C. gariepinus (96 -hour LC₆₀ = 6. 5 mg. ℓ·'), but their 96 -hour LC₆₀ salinity tolerances were similar (10. 8 - 11. 0 g. ℓ·'). The H. longifilis ♂ x C. gariepinus ♀ hybrid had a higher fillet yield (43. 9 %) than C. gariepinus (38. 9 % 1, but the crude protein content and amino acid profile of the two groups were similar. Catfish are traditionally grown in earthen ponds under semiintensive conditions in southern Africa, at around 4 kg of fish per cubic meter of water (kg. m·'). However, the hybrid could tolerate densities of up to 415 kg of fish per cubic metre of water, if the water was exchanged hourly (kg. m·'. hr'), and the density at which yield was optimised was rounded off to 400 kg. m·'. hr·'. The high threshold density and water quality tolerances of the H. longifilis ♂ x C. gariepinus ♀ hybrid indicates that it is ideally suited for highly intensive aquaculture. It was concluded that it would be more productive to farm the HL♂xCG♀ hybrid on an intensive basis in southern Africa, than it would be to farm C. gariepinus in the traditional manner. ...|$|E
40|$|The post-larvae and fry of Australian native species, {{including}} those of species belonging to the family Percichthyidae, are routinely reared to a fingerling size (35 - 55 mm in length) in fertilised earthen fry rearing ponds. The juveniles of Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii trout cod (Maccullochella macquariensis) and Macquarie perch (Macquaria australasicd) (Percichthyidae) are grown in fry rearing ponds at the Marine and Freshwater Resources Institute, Snobs Creek (Vie. Australia) for production of fingerlings for stock enhancement and aquaculture purposes. However, no detailed studies have been undertaken of the productivity of these ponds and factors that influence fish production. An ecologically based study was undertaken to increase the knowledge of pond ecology and dynamics, particularly {{in relation to the}} rearing of juvenile Murray cod, trout cod and Macquarie perch in ponds. Over nine consecutive seasons commencing in 1991, water chemistry, plankton, macrobenthos (2 seasons only) and fish were monitored and studied in five ponds located at Snobs Creek. A total of 80 pond fillings were undertaken during the study period. Additional data collected from another 24 pond fillings undertaken at Snobs Creek collected prior to this study were included in some analyses. Water chemistry parameters monitored in the ponds included, temperature, dissolved oxygen pH, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, orthophosphate and alkalinity. Water chemistry varied spatially (within and between ponds) and temporally (diurnally, daily and seasonally). Liming of ponds increased the total alkalinity to levels that were considered to be suitable for enhancing plankton communities and fish production. Water quality within the ponds for the most part was suitable for the rearing of juvenile Murray cod, trout cod and Macquarie perch, as reflected in overall production (growth, survival and yield) from the ponds. However, at times some parameters reached levels which may have stressed fish and reduced growth and survival, in particular, low dissolved oxygen concentrations (minimum 1. 18 mg/L), high temperatures (maximum 34 °C), high pH (maximum 10. 38) and high <b>unionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> (maximum 0. 58 mg/L). Species belonging to 37 phytoplankton, 45 zooplankton and 17 chironomid taxa were identified from the ponds during the study. In addition, an extensive checklist of aquatic flora and fauna, recorded from aquaculture ponds in south-eastern Australia, was compiled. However, plankton and benthos samples were usually numerically dominated by a few species only. Rotifers (especially Filinia, Brachionus, Polyarthra, and Asplanchnd), cladocerans (Moina and Daphnid) and copepods (Mesocyclops and Boeckelld) were most abundant and common in the plankton, while chironomids (Chironomus, Polypedilum, and Prodadius) and oligochaetes were most common and abundant in the benthos. Both abundance and species composition of the plankton and macrobenthos varied spatially (within and between ponds) and temporally (diurnally, daily and seasonally). Chlorophyll a concentrations, which ranged from 1. 8 to 184 /L (mean 29. 37 ng/L), initially peaked within two weeks of filling and fertilising the ponds. Zooplankton peaked in abundance 2 - 4 weeks after filling the ponds. The maximum zooplankton density recorded in the ponds was 6, 621 ind. /L (mean 721 ind. /L). Typically, amongst the zooplankton, rotifers were first to develop high densities (2 nd- 3 rd week after filling), followed by cladocerans (2 nd- 4 th week after filling) then copepods (2 nd- 5 th week after filling). Chironomid abundance on average peaked later (during the 5 th week after filling). The maximum chironomid density recorded in the ponds was 27, 470 ind. /m 2 (mean 4, 379 ind. /m 2). Length-weight, age-weight and age-length relationships were determined for juvenile Murray cod, trout cod and Macquarie perch reared in ponds. These relationships were most similar for Murray cod and trout cod, which are more closely related phylogenetically and similar morphologically than Macquarie perch. Growth of fish was negatively correlated with both size at stocking and stocking biomass. Stocking density experiments showed that, at higher densities, growth offish was significantly reduced, but survival was not affected. The diets of juvenile Murray cod trout cod and Macquarie perch reared in fry ponds were similar. The cladocerans Moina and Daphnia, adult calanoid and cyclopoid copepods and the chironomids, Chironomus, Polypedilum and Procladius were the most commonly occurring and abundant prey. Selection for rotifers and copepod nauplii was strongly negative for all three species of fish. Size range of prey consumed was positively correlated with fish size for trout cod and Macquarie perch, but not for Murray cod. Diet composition changed as the fish grew. Early after stocking the fish into the ponds, Moina was generally the more common prey consumed, while in latter weeks, copepods and chironomids became more abundant and common in the diet. On a dry weight basis, chironomid larvae were the most important component in the diets of these fish species. Selective feeding by fish on larger planktonic species such as adult copepods and cladocerans, may have influenced the plankton community structure as proposed by the trophic cascade or top -down hypothesis. The proximate composition and energy content of Murray cod, trout cod and Macquarie perch, reared in the ponds did not vary significantly between the species, and few significant changes were observed as the fish grew. These results suggested that the nutrient requirements of these species might not vary over the size range of fish examined. Significant differences in the proximate composition of prey were observed between species, size of species and time of season. The energy content of prey (cladocerans, copepods and chironomids) on a pond basis, was closely related to the abundance of these taxa in the ponds. Data collected from all pond fillings during the present study, along with historical data from pond fillings undertaken prior to this study, were combined in a data matrix and analysed for interactions between pairs of parameters. In particular, interactions between selected water chemistry parameters, zooplankton and chironomid abundance indicators were analysed to identify key factors that influence fish production (growth, survival, condition and yield). Significant correlations were detected between fish production indicators and several water chemistry and biota (zooplankton and chironomids) parameters. However, these were not consistent across all three species of fish. These results indicated that the interactions between water chemistry, biota and fish were complex, and that combinations of these parameters, along with other factors not included in the present study, may influence fish production in these ponds. The present study, showed that more stringent monitoring of fry rearing ponds, especially water quality, zooplankton and benthos communities and fish, combined with an associated increase in understanding of the pond ecosystem, can lead to substantial improvements in pond productivity and associated fish production. In the present study this has resulted in a general increase in fish survival rates, which became less variable or more predictable in nature. The value of such knowledge can provide managers with a more predicative capacity to estimate production of ponds in support of stock enhancement programs and provision of juvenile for aquaculture grow-out...|$|E
