5000|$|Christopher Beeston was a {{very talented}} man that [...] "managed five Phoenix companies: Queen Anne's (1617-19), Prince Charles’s (1619-22), Lady Elizabeth’s (1622-5), Henrietta Maria’s (1625-37) and the King and Queen’s Young company". Beeston already had an immense amount of {{experience}} in the theatre profession from managing these companies and he also had the copyright to many of the plays performed at the Phoenix, which was very unordinary at the time. Beeston’s Boys performed plays including Cupid's Revenge, The Knight of the Burning Pestle and The Court Beggar. The last play, The Court Beggar, got Beeston's Boys in a severe amount of trouble that resulted in William Davenant taking over the theatre for an interim time.

50|$|Historically, {{one set of}} {{resources}} was dedicated to one particular computing technology, business application or line of business, and managed in a silo-like fashion. These resources supported a single set of requirements and processes, and couldn’t easily be optimized or reconfigured to support actual demand. This led technology providers to build out and complement their product-centric infrastructure and management offerings with Converged Infrastructure environments that converge servers, storage, networking, security, management and facilities. The efficiencies of having this type of integrated and automated management environment allows enterprises to get their applications <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>running</b> faster, <b>with</b> simpler manageability and maintenance, and enables IT to adjust IT resources (such as servers, storage and networking) quicker to meet unpredictable business demand.|$|R

A big difference from The Pyros {{was that this}} time the main material played consisted of Doherty's original songs. These were complemented by the inclusion of songs {{by the likes of}} Hank Williams and Dwight Yoakam. The band was a big hit live and ventured further afield in Ireland compared to The Pyros. Radio and television appearances also became part of the picture. The band were exceptional musicians and, somewhat similar to The Pyros, were well known for really getting a crowd going, {{as well as for the}} sensitive playing on Doherty's more downbeat numbers.|$|R

50|$|From a mail administrator's {{point of}} view the benefit is twofold. Greylisting takes minimal {{configuration}} to get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>with</b> occasional modifications of any local whitelists. The second benefit is that rejecting email with a temporary 451 error (actual error code is implementation dependent) is very cheap in system resources. Most spam filtering tools are very intensive users of CPU and memory. By stopping spam before it hits filtering processes, far fewer system resources are used. This allows more layers of spam filtering or higher throughput since greylisting can easily be configured as a {{first line of defense}} with a heuristic filter such as SpamAssassin handling messages that go through.|$|E

40|$|Most of today‘s HPC systems {{employ a}} single head node for control, which {{represents}} {{a single point}} of failure as it interrupts an entire HPC system upon failure. Furthermore, it is also a single point of control as it disables an entire HPC system until repair. One of the most important HPC system service running on the head node is the job and resource management. If it goes down, all currently running jobs loose the service they report back to. They have to be restarted once the head node is <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>running</b> again. <b>With</b> this paper, we present a generic approach for providing symmetric active/active replication for highly available HPC job and resource management. The JOSHUA solution provides a virtually synchronous environment for continuous availability without any interruption of service and without any loss of state. Replication is performed externally via the PBS service interface without the need to modify any service code. Test results as well as availability analysis of our proof-of-concept prototype implementation show that continuous availability can be provided by JOSHUA with an acceptable performance trade-off. ...|$|R

5000|$|Cloud {{computing}} is a computing {{infrastructure and}} software model for enabling ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable resources (e.g., computer networks, servers, storage, applications and services), {{which can be}} rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet. Cloud computing allows users, and enterprises, with various computing capabilities to store and process data in either a privately owned cloud, or on a third-party server located in a data center {{in order to make}} data accessing mechanisms more efficient and reliable. [...] Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy of scale, similar to a utility. Advocates note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid, or minimize, up-front infrastructure costs. As well, third party clouds enable organizations to focus on their core businesses instead of expending resources on computer infrastructure and maintenance. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>running</b> faster, <b>with</b> improved manageability and less maintenance, and enables information technology (IT) teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business demand. Cloud providers typically use a [...] "pay as you go" [...] model. This could lead to unexpectedly high charges if administrators are not familiarized with cloud pricing models.|$|R
40|$|Since it {{is common}} to have data {{residing}} across several platforms, it is important to utilize the strengths of each computer system. SAS/CONNECT ® Software enables you to view and update your data on multiple platforms from any one connected computer. This paper provides some quick and easy code to get your SAS/CONNECT applications <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>running</b> smoothly. <b>With</b> only a few simple statements you can manipulate your UNIX or mainframe based data from your PC environment without batch processing. Similarly you may submit and run UNIX SAS programs from an MVS batch job. The data may actually reside on either platform. With business or research data residing on various platforms the SAS system utilizes the client server model to access the data wherever it resides. SAS/CONNECT Software is one tool for us to view, edit, manipulate or copy data from one platform to another. The SAS/CONNECT software must be installed on each platform.
