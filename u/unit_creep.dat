40|$|When creep {{recovery}} is {{predicted by the}} principle of superposition from the <b>unit</b> <b>creep</b> curves for various loading ages, both Branson's law (ACI 209 / 11) and the double power law give non-monotonic recovery curves. This has been criticized by some as thermodynamically inadmissible. Using an age-dependent Maxwell chain model, it is shown, however, that this phen-omenon is thermodynamically admissible. Creep recovery, though, is not accurately predicted by the principle of superposition, and the result should rather be interpreted as the admissibility of a divergence of creep curves for different loading ages, which is indeed observed in many meas-urements. Such divergence can be modeled by Maxwell chains but not by Kelvin chains, so the latter imply an arbitrary, unjustified limitation. The same is characteristic of the "improved Dischinger formulation " (re-centlyadopted from DIN for the new C. E. B. Model Code), which represents a special case of Kelvin chain. This is a further reason why the separa-tion of reversible (delayed elastic) creep component is an arbitrary as...|$|E
40|$|The Al powder was {{prepared}} by cold isostatic pressing at {{the pressure of}} 200 MPa. The granulometric powder fraction of a particle size less than 400 µm was compacted via conventional direct hot-extrusion (DE) at temperature 450 °C. This material was then subjected to ECAP technique up to 4 passes. The microstructural investigations were performed using OM and SEM equipped with an EBSD <b>unit.</b> <b>Creep</b> tests in tension were conducted at temperature of 473 K and at applied stresses {{in the range from}} 30 to 60 MPa. Some creep tests in compression were performed on material just after DE. The paper presents results of study of microstructure and creep behaviour of aluminium powder before and after ECAP. It was found that ECAP method does not lead to an additional marked refinement of grain size. However, in dependence on number of ECAP passes ECAP method markedly influences creep behaviour due to development of high-angle grain boundaries during ECAP process...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{time-dependent}} deformations and prestress {{losses in}} pretensioned, prestressed simply supported concrete girders, {{based on the}} revised rate of creep method, are presented. The effects of age of precast girders {{at the time of}} casting of the deck concrete, time of transfer of prestress, deck dead load, type of prestressing strands (stress-relieved or low-relaxation strands), initial level of stress in the concrete, and the effects of varying environmental conditions on the behavior of concrete structures are studied. Predicted <b>unit</b> <b>creep</b> and shrinkage strains versus time relationships are based on the 1970 C. E. B. recommendations and relaxation losses for stress-relieved strands are estimated using the expressions developed by Magura, Sozen, and Siess. A similar expression is used for the case of low-relaxation strands. Predicted deformations are compared with long-term measurements made on full-sized bridge structures located in Illinois. Annual cyclic variations of the total strains and total prestress force occur in all structures located outdoors. Two recommended sets of factors for the estimation of prestress losses are given, one for the case of stress-relieved strands and the other for the case of low-relaxation strands.

40|$|Ethylene-octene {{copolymers}} (EOCs) {{with two}} different octene contents (20 and 35 wt%) {{and the same}} melt flow index (3 g per 10 min) were cross-linked using various levels (0. 3, 0. 5 and 0. 7 wt%) of dicumyl peroxide at different temperatures. Cross-linking and degradation were analyzed by rubber process analyzer (RPA) within a temperature range of 150 - 200 °C. The highest s′ max (maximum elastic torque) and the lowest tan(delta) were found for EOC- 20 with low-octene content at all cross-linking temperatures. Lower peroxide efficiency was observed {{in the case of}} the high-octene copolymer. Increased degradation was observed with increasing cross-linking temperature. High-octene EOC was found to be more vulnerable to degradation. According to dynamic mechanical analysis, the storage modulus (M′) and the glass transition temperature (T g) obtained from the tan(delta) peaks were found to decrease with increasing octene content. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results show that the octene content has an inverse effect on the crystallinity (X) and melting point (T m) - due to the reduction in the average number of consecutive ethylene <b>units.</b> <b>Creep</b> testing at 150 °C confirmed the cross-linkability results obtained by RPA and the gel content analyses. Increased β-scission due to high numbers of tertiary carbon atoms present in the chain has resulted in the poorer cross-linking and inferior properties of high-octene EOC. © 2013 The Society of Polymer Science, Japan (SPSJ) All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|On 9 April, {{all three}} regiments of the 40th Division pushed east into the rugged, mountainous {{interior}} of the island.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 An {{ecological}} study of small forest mammals was conducted from 1964 to 1970. The objectives were to obtain chronological information {{relative to the}} effects of current logging practices on vegetational succession and small mammal populations. The locale of the study was in the west-central Cascade Mountains of Oregon. The principal timber species was Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii. The climate was characterized by heavy precipitation in the winter and dry summers. Snowfall varied from slight to heavy. Elevation was 3000 feet. The study areas were composed of a 125 -year-old timbered control unit, a clearcut non-burned unit, and a clearcut slash-burned unit. Density and distribution of the small mammals were determined by live-trapping and release of marked animals. Reproductive information of some species was noted. Home range areas was computed for the more numerous species of rodents. More than 4530 individual small mammals of 23 mammalian species were marked on the three areas during the six years of the study. Over 90 percent of the total animals caught consisted of five species: Sorex spp, Eutamias townsendii, Peromyscus maniculatus, and Microtus oregoni. The small mammal densities varied from year to year. They were comparable between units on a monthly basis except for the unburned clearcut unit which differed for a year following logging. Shrew numbers, abundant in the forest, were less on the unburned and sharply reduced on the slash-burned unit. Deermice, scarce in the closed forest, increased greatly in numbers on the clearcuts. Chipmunks were abundant in the forest, less on the slash- burned clearcut unit, and sharply reduced in numbers on the unburned <b>unit.</b> <b>Creeping</b> mice were scarce in the forest but their numbers erupted on the clearcuts. Snowshoe hares were, caught periodically in the timber but not on the clearcuts. Some species, caught infrequently or known only by sign, are expected to increase and become more numerous as the vegetation becomes brushier. These include the snowshoe hare, mountain beaver, porcupine, and the pocket gopher. The {{results of this study suggest}} that more information is required relative to the diet of the small mammals. Effects of vegetational manipulation, by selective cutting practices or by the use of herbicides on small mammals should be examined...|$|R

40|$|Coarse-grained binary Cu and Al alloys were {{processed}} by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) {{in order to}} evaluate the effect of severe plastic deformation on the thermal stability of resulting ultrafine-grained microstructure after ECAP followed by creep loading of the pressed alloys.

50|$|As {{the troops}} of the various <b>units</b> began slowly <b>creeping</b> up the hill, firing their rifles at the {{opposition}} as they climbed, Roosevelt went to {{the captain of the}} platoons in back and had a word with him. He stated that it was his opinion that they could not effectively take the hill due to an insufficient ability to effectively return fire, and that the solution was to charge it full-on. The captain reiterated his colonel's orders to hold position. Roosevelt, recognizing the absence of the other Colonel, declared himself the ranking officer and ordered a charge up Kettle Hill. The captain stood hesitant, and Colonel Roosevelt rode off on his horse, Texas, leading his own men uphill while waving his hat in the air and cheering. The Rough Riders followed him with enthusiasm and obedience without hesitation. By then, the other men from the different units on the hill became stirred by this event and began bolting up the hill alongside their countrymen. The 'charge' was actually a series of short rushes by mixed groups of regulars and Rough Riders. Within twenty minutes Kettle Hill was taken, though casualties were heavy. The rest of San Juan Heights was taken within the hour following.|$|R
40|$|Heat-treatment {{belongs to}} the most {{ecological}} methods of wood preservation methods and increase of its natural stability in exposition to outdoor conditions. Research of mechanical properties opens new possibilities of thermowood usage in general. Wood appertains to viscoelastic materials and due to long-term loading creeps. There currently rise both elastic deformation, deformation elastic in time and plastic deformation. Partially there are irreversible changes due to stress even after unloading. This work presents first insight to the matters of thermowood rheology and inspects its behavior under long-term loading in bending. This paper compares ratio of these three types of deformation in untreated wood and thermally modified wood in seven different temperatures (140; 160; 180; 190; 200, 210 °C). The samples were exposed to 600 hours applied loading covering 40 % of ultimate stress (modulus of rapture). Test were performed under constant conditions in special <b>creep</b> <b>units</b> in conditioning kiln. Increasing deformation under constant load was analyzed by Burger rheological model. The results show that samples treated under lower temperatures (140 and 160 °C) exhibit greater creep than untreated wood. This result is positive for structural usage of wood. On the other hand the samples treated under higher temperatures levels (200 an 210 °C) display deterioration of mechanical properties. This is due to changes in wood structures caused by heat-treatment. The most important impact of this work goes to future research of this field. Next development has {{to apply for the}} best quality of samples and also select rather prismatic parallelism than transversal one. Also application of 40 % ultimate stress loading appeared as too high and together with wood defects led to destruction of samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of cyclic loading on the extensibility of hamstring muscle-tendon units in vivo. Study Design: A test-retest randomised controlled trial with repeated measures was undertaken. Background: Stretching has been commonly promoted to increase the passive extensibility of the muscle-tendon units, yet the mechanism behind its proposed effects remains ambiguous. In vivo studies of stretching have mostly been limited to the viscoelastic characteristic of stress-relaxation. Few studies have investigated the characteristic of creep. Animal and cadaver in vitro creep experiments have consistently shown increases in the length of the soft tissues, with associated changes in their resistance and stiffness. These results however, might not be representative of human muscle-tendon units under in vivo conditions. Additionally, those in vivo human studies that have investigated creep phenomenon have contrasting results. To date, no known in vivo study has examined passive cyclic loading of human hamstrings to a constant load level. Method: Using a repeated measures design the extensibility of the hamstring muscles were assessed by a passive knee extension test (PKE) to maximal stretch tolerance using a KinCom® dynamometer. Those participants in the intervention group underwent 45 continuous passive cyclic loadings as the KinCom® dynamometer moved the knee joint into extension until torque reached 85 % of maximal passive resistance torque measured in the passive knee extension test. The control group sat quietly relaxed during the intervention period. Measurements of hamstring passive extensibility using the PKE test were repeated at the end of the intervention. Results: Following the intervention, the PKE test showed for the cyclic loading group there was a significant (p 0. 05) was found for passive stiffness for the full (100 %) of the torque-angle curve. Of the control group, no significant differences (p > 0. 05) were observed for all variables of the PKE test. Analysis of cycle one compared to forty-five of the cyclic loading intervention procedure showed a significant (p 0. 05) was found for passive stiffness across the full (100 %) knee joint torque-angle. Conclusion: The findings of the current study demonstrated that after cyclic loading the hamstring muscles lengthened and became stiffer over the final gained range of knee joint motion. Although the current study cannot determine the mechanism behind the changes in the variables of interest, these findings do provide some evidence that most likely a combination of altered stretch tolerance and local mechanical effects within the muscle-tendon <b>unit,</b> i. e. <b>creep</b> lengthening were responsible...|$|R
40|$|A Cu- 8 at. % Cr- 4 at. % Nb (Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb) alloy {{is under}} {{development}} for high-temperature, high heatflux applications, such as actively cooled, hypersonic vehicle heat exchangers and rocket engine combustion chambers. Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb offers a superior combination {{of strength and}} conductivity. It has also shown exceptional low-cycle fatigue properties. Following preliminary testing {{to determine the best}} processing route, a more detailed testing program was initiated to determine the creep lives and creep rates of Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb alloy specimens produced by extrusion. Testing was conducted at the NASA Lewis Research Center with constant-load vacuum <b>creep</b> <b>units.</b> Considering expected operating temperatures and mission lives, we developed a test matrix to accurately determine the creep properties of Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb between 500 and 800 C. Six bars of Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb were extruded. From these bars, 54 creep samples were machined and tested. The figure on the left shows the steady-state, or second-stage, creep rates for the samples. Comparison data for NARloy-Z (Cu- 3 wt % Ag- 0. 5 wt % Zr), the alloy currently used in combustion chamber liners, were not unavailable. Therefore the steady-state creep rates for Cu at similar temperatures are presented. As expected, in comparison to pure Cu, the creep rates for Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb are much lower. The lives of the samples are presented in the figure on the right. As shown, Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb at 800 C is comparable to NARloy-Z at 648 C. At equivalent temperatures, Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb enjoys a 20 to 50 percent advantage in stress for a given life and 1 to 3 orders of magnitude greater life at a given stress. The improved properties allow for design tradeoffs and improvements in new and existing heat exchangers such as the next generation of combustion chamber liners. Average creep rates for Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb and pure Cu are shown. Average creep lives for Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb and NARloy-Z are also shown. Currently, two companies are interested in the commercial usage of the Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb alloy. The Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International is conducting independent testing to analyze the properties for their projected needs in advanced rocket engine applications. Metallamics, a company based in Traverse City, Michigan, is entering into a Space Act Agreement to evaluate and test Cu-Cr-Nb alloys as materials for welding electrodes that are used in robotic welding operations. Creep rate is one of the alloy properties that determines {{the degree to which a}} welding electrode will mushroom or expand at the tip. A material with a low creep rate will resist mushrooming and give the electrode a longer life, minimizing downtime. This application holds the potential for large-scale usage of the alloy in the automotive and other industries. Success here would dramatically decrease the cost of the alloy and increase availability for aerospace applications...|$|R
