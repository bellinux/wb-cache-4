40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} the coordination of optimal reclosing and fuzzy logic-controlled braking resistor on the transient stability of a multimachine power system in case of an <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>reclosing</b> of circuit breakers. The transient stability performance of the coordinated operation of optimal reclosing and fuzzy controlled braking resistor is compared to that of the coordinated operation of conventional auto-reclosing and fuzzy controlled braking resistor. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulations in case of a nine-bus power system model as well as a ten-machine system. Simulation results of both balanced and unbalanced faults at different points in the power systems show that the coordinated operation of optimal reclosing and fuzzy controlled braking resistor is able to stabilize the systems well in case of an <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>reclosing.</b> Moreover, the transient stability performance of the coordinated operation of optimal reclosing and fuzzy controlled braking resistor is better than that of the coordinated operation of conventional auto-reclosing and fuzzy controlled braking resistor...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of analyses of the extension of the dead time by superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL). Although SFCL is generally used for the purpose of limiting of fault currents, it {{can also be used to}} stabilize synchronous generators. Therefore, as the transient stability when the fault occurs is enhanced effectively by SFCL, the reclosing time of circuit breakers can be delayed. It means the possibility of <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>reclosing</b> of circuit breakers can be lowered...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{analyses}} the torsional {{efforts in}} gas turbine-generator shafts caused by high speed automatic reclosing of transmission lines. This issue {{is especially important}} for cases of three phase short circuit and unsuccessful reclosure of lines {{in the vicinity of the}} thermal plant. The analysis was carried out for the thermal plant TERMOPERNAMBUCO located on Northeast region of Brazil. It is shown that stress level caused by lines <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>reclosing</b> can be several times higher than terminal three-phase short circuit. Simulations were carried out with detailed shaft torsional model provided by machine manufacturer and with the “Alternative Transient Program – ATP ” program [1]. Unsuccessful three phase reclosing for selected lines in the area closed to the plant indicated most critical cases. Also, reclosing first the terminal next to the gas turbine gererator will lead also to the most critical condition. Considering that the values of transient torques are very sensible to the instant of reclosing, simulation of <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>reclosing</b> with statistics ATP switch were carried out for determination of most critical transient torques for each section of the generator turbine shaft...|$|E
40|$|In a power system, the {{auto-reclosing}} schemes {{are applied}} {{in order to}} enhance the transient stability. However, conventional auto-reclosing techniques adopt fixed time interval reclosing, that is, the circuit breakers reclose after a prescribed dead time. Since the transient stability is dependent on the generator state of reclosing instance, this method may cause an unstable state when <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>reclosing</b> occurs. Therefore, the method to determine the optimal reclosing time is needed {{in order to enhance}} the transient stability of power system effectively. This paper proposes the method to determine an optimal reclosing time by using the kinetic energy of synchronous generators. The significance of this method is that it uses the kinetic energy of each generator which can be obtained easily. Consequently, this technique may be implemented for the on-line application. The proposed method is verified by simulation study using EMTP/ATP...|$|E
40|$|Wind energy being a {{renewable}} {{and environmental}} friendly has become {{important source of}} electrical power in recent years. As the wind power penetration increases day by day, it is required that wind turbines {{are connected to the}} grid actively to contribute in the system stability during and after grid faults. This paper focuses on a new topology, for reactive power compensation, voltage regulation and transient stability enhancement for wind turbines equipped with fixed-speed induction generators in large interconnected power systems. This study proposes an efficient control strategy to improve the low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability by using the pitch controller during successful reclosing of CBs. Besides the <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>reclosing</b> of circuit breakers, the performance of controller is also evaluated. Extensive simulations have been carried out with real wind speed data and different time durations, where the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified using power system simulator PSCAD/EMTDC...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an optimum design procedure for the controller {{used in the}} frequency converter of a variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) driven doubly fed asynchronous generator (DFAG) by using Proportional-Integral (PI) controller. The cascaded control is frequently used in {{the control of the}} frequency converter using the proportional PI controllers. The setting of the parameters of the PI controller used in a large system is cumbersome, especially in an electrical power system, which is difficult to be expressed by a mathematical model or transfer function. This study attempts to optimally design the parameters of the PI controllers used in the frequency converter of a variable speed wind energy conversion system (WECS). The permanent fault condition due to <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>reclosing</b> of circuit breakers is considered as well. It re{{presents an}}other salient feature of this study. It is found that fault-ridethrough of VSWT-DFIG can be improved considerably using the parameters of its frequency converter obtained from PI controller...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work is mainly concerned {{about dealing with}} temporary short circuit faults in power system transmission lines. In fact, {{there are two types}} of electrical faults in power systems, namely temporary and permanent. When a fault is permanent, the only way to clear it is to de-energize the transmission line by opening the associated circuit breakers. However, in many cases the fault is not solid and is caused by objects such as flying birds or broken branches of trees. For these cases, electrical arc plays a major role. For such fault cases, it is also possible to de-energize the faulted phase, temporarily, and re-energize it after a short delay by reclosing the opened circuit breakers. This operation is called single-phase reclosing. There is a chance that the fault becomes clear by natural extinction of the arc after the faulted phase isolation in case the fault is temporary. There are two considerable challenges regarding traditional single-phase reclosing in transmission lines. The first challenge is the determination of the fault type, i. e., permanent or temporary, as there is no guarantee that the fault is temporary. This is crucially important as reclosing-on-fault, i. e., reclosing the opened breakers while the fault still stands, is harmful for both power system stability and power system equipment. The second challenge which is regarding temporary faults only, is that there is still no guarantee that the arc is extinguished by the moment of reclosing. In such cases, reclosing leads in re-striking of arc and therefore, an <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>reclosing.</b> This {{research work}} is conducted in two phases. At the first phase, two adaptive methods are developed to improve the traditional reclosing method upon the two challenges mentioned in the second paragraph. The developed methods are capable of recognition of the fault type in a reasonable amount of time after single-phase isolation of the line. Therefore, the protection system will be able to block the reclosing function in case the fault is recognized as permanent and to issue three-phase-trip signal as the next action. For temporary faults, re-energizing of the isolated phase by reclosing the opened breakers is the next action which has to be performed after the arc extinction. The developed methods also have the capability of detection of the arc extinction and therefore, a better performance for temporary fault cases is guaranteed. This is the second feature required for an adaptive reclosing method. The second phase of the research project is to estimate the arc extinction time well in advance in case the fault is temporary. The idea is that three-phase tripping could be the right action if the arc extinction time is too long as working under unbalanced conditions for an unnecessarily long time duration is harmful for the power system. Both of the proposed adaptive single-phase reclosing methods in this research work employ local voltage information. Therefore, communication facilities are not needed for implementation of the proposed methods. It is shown in the thesis that the proposed methods are able to quickly detect the fault type and also the arc extinction if the fault is temporary. Also, the two proposed arc extinction time prediction methods are capable of prediction of the arc extinction time well in advance and with acceptable precision. All four proposed methods are effective for various system configurations including ideally-transposed, untransposed and partially-transposed transmission lines and also for transmission lines with different compensation conditions including with and without shunt reactor. Superior performance of the proposed methods have been verified using 550 case studies simulated in PSCAD and Matlab, and also a field recorded temporary fault case associated with a 765 kV transmission line. The 550 simulated case studies include 100 ideally-transposed, 240 untransposed and 210 partially-transposed line cases. The performances of the two proposed reclosing methods are also compared with two of the existing adaptive reclosing methods where considerable improvements are observed...|$|E
