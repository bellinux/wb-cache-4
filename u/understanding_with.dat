5|$|In 1613 Sigismund III Vasa {{reached an}} <b>understanding</b> <b>with</b> Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor, based on which both sides agreed to {{cooperate}} and mutually provide assistance in suppressing internal rebellions.

5|$|On May 26, 1849, Nicolae Bălcescu {{met with}} Kossuth in Debrecen, and, despite his {{personal}} disappointment with the Hungarian discourse and his ideal of full political rights for Romanians in the region, agreed to mediate an <b>understanding</b> <b>with</b> Iancu, {{which resulted in}} a ceasefire and a series of political concessions. This came as Russian troops were entering Transylvania, a military operation culminating in Hungarian defeat at the Battle of Segesvár in late July.|$|E

40|$|Behaviors {{that pose}} threats to safety and health, {{including}} binge drinking and unprotected sex, increase during a week-long break from university. <b>Understandings</b> <b>with</b> peers regarding these behaviors {{may be important}} for predicting behavior and related harms. College students (N = 651; 48 % men) reported having <b>understandings</b> <b>with</b> their friends regarding alcohol use (59 %) and sexual behavior (45 %) during Spring Break. These understandings were to engage in behaviors characterized by risk (e. g., get drunk [23. 5 %], have sex with someone new [5. 2 %]) and protection (e. g., drink without getting drunk [17. 8 %], use condoms [15. 8 %]). After controlling for previous semester behavior and going on a Spring Break trip, Get Drunk Understandings predicted a greater likelihood of binge drinking and alcohol-related consequences; No/Safe Sex Understandings predicted condom use; and Sex Understandings predicted not using condoms. <b>Understandings</b> <b>with</b> friends regarding Spring Break behavior may be important proximal predictors of risk behaviors and represent potential targets for event-specific prevention...|$|R

But Acyl died on 19 July, replaced by Acheikh ibn Oumar, and the CDR was antagonized by Habré's eagerness to unify the country, which led him to overrun the CDR's domains.|$|E

5|$|Tirunelveli {{is a major}} {{area for}} wind-power generation. Most wind-power-generation units in Tamil Nadu are located in Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari Districts. In 2005 they contributed 2036.9 MW to the state power-generation capacity. Many private, {{multinational}} wind companies are located {{on the outskirts of}} the city. In June 2007 the Tata Group signed a memorandum of <b>understanding</b> <b>with</b> the state government to open a titanium dioxide plant, with an estimated value of 25billion, in Tirunelveli District and Thoothukudi District. However, the state government put the project on hold after increasing protests against it.|$|E

5|$|After the 1976 Gulf Cup of Nations the {{managerial}} staff was changed and the Iraq Football Association assigned the Croatian manager, Lenko Grčić, {{as the new}} manager of the Iraq national football team, Saeed was called up to the national team, {{for the first time}} in his career, at the age of 18. He made his debut on 5 September 1976 in a friendly match against Saudi Arabia where they drew 0–0. He continued to play in the youth team because the manager, Miodgard Stankovic, was Yugoslavian, reaching an <b>understanding</b> <b>with</b> Grčić. Iraq achieved the 1977 AFC Youth Championship where Saeed scored the winning goal in the final, from a diving header in the 90th minute, against Iran in a 4–3 victory in Tehran. Saeed was also the top goalscorer of this edition with 9 goals, scoring his first national hat-trick against Afghanistan in Iraq's 5–1 win. The same team represented Iraq in the first edition of the FIFA World Youth Championship in 1977 where they lost 3–1 to the Soviet Union, won 5–1 over Austria with Saeed scoring a hat-trick, and lost 4–0 to Paraguay which knocked them out of the competition.|$|E
5|$|Airbus {{signed a}} {{memorandum}} of <b>understanding</b> <b>with</b> Drukair in July 2003 for two 114-seat Airbus A319-115, powered by two CFM56-5B engines, for delivery {{in the second}} half of 2004. The purchase of the two jets, valued at 3,534.36 million Bhutanese ngultrum (BTN), was the biggest single purchase ever made by Bhutan, and was largely responsible for a 250 percent increase in the Bhutanese trade deficit over the previous year for the financial year 2004–2005. The Bhutanese government issued BTN 1,767.18 million in government bonds to pay for one aircraft and for only the second time in Bhutan's history intended to seek a commercial loan for the other aircraft. However, in October 2004 it announced it would instead seek a soft loan for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Another of Dannatt's {{priorities}} was {{tackling the}} perception of the British operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as he was concerned the news media and the British public were unaware of the purpose or the intensity of the missions. Disgruntled by increasingly negative coverage, he interrupted a family holiday in Cornwall to fly to Afghanistan in an effort to change the coverage through a series of interviews. During the visit, he managed to meet with his son, Bertie, who was serving in the country with the Grenadier Guards. Later in 2007, Dannatt raised the same issue in a lecture to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Earlier that year, Dannatt had taken the decision not to allow Prince Harry to serve in Iraq. However, after Dannatt had brokered an <b>understanding</b> <b>with</b> the British press, Harry was able to serve in Afghanistan for three months in late 2007 and early 2008 until the story broke and he was ordered home.|$|E

5|$|Argentina {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} in 1994, the AMIA bombing targeting a Buenos Aires Jewish center, that killed 85 people and wounded 300. The investigation remained open for years, and prosecutor Alberto Nisman {{was appointed to the}} case. He accused Iran of organizing the attack, and the Hezbollah group of carrying it out. He intended to prosecute five Iranian officials, including former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, but Argentina signed a memorandum of <b>understanding</b> <b>with</b> Iran for a joint investigation. Nisman accused the president of signing that memorandum for oil and trade benefits, according to hundreds of hours of wiretaps. On 19 January 2015 he was found dead at his home, a day before a congressional hearing to explain his accusation, which caused a great controversy. As of 2016, both the cases of the AMIA bombing and the death of Nisman remain unresolved, and the courts declined at the time to investigate his denunciation of Kirchner.|$|E
5|$|He and Doctor Phlox then tend to Porthos, and Archer {{spends the}} night in Sickbay {{to be with his}} pet. Throughout the night, as Porthos' immune system weakens, Archer {{experiences}} Phlox's side of life in Sickbay. During the night, as he dreams of Porthos' funeral, Archer also deals with unresolved and suppressed sexual tension with T'Pol. He also relates to Phlox how he met Porthos, and how he was the last in a litter of four male puppies, the 'Four Musketeers'. Through it all, Archer struggles to reach an emotional <b>understanding</b> <b>with</b> Phlox and T'Pol, as the two alien senior-crew members have little grasp of the human-pet relationship, and Phlox keeps offering Archer unsolicited advice about dealing with his apparent feelings for T'Pol.|$|E
5|$|Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, {{leader of}} the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an <b>understanding</b> <b>with</b> the President. He ushered through Congress a bill {{extending}} the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, {{to the delight of}} white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.|$|E

5|$|Meredith {{made his}} debut for the Chirk first team in September 1892. The club played in The Combination, a league which {{contained}} {{a mixture of}} town clubs and reserve teams of clubs from big cities. At {{the end of his}} first season Meredith played in the 1893 Welsh Cup final, which Chirk lost 2–1 to Wrexham. Meredith formed a solid <b>understanding</b> <b>with</b> inside-right William Owen, a former Wales international. Chirk withdrew from The Combination and entered only the Welsh league in 1893 due to low attendances caused by the coal miners' strike. In an attempt to make ends meet, Meredith not only played for Chirk, but accepted an offer to play for Football League club Northwich Victoria as well, who gave him a small fee on top of his expenses. Northwich were a struggling side, who withdrew from the Football League {{at the end of the}} 1893–94 season after finishing bottom of the Second Division. The club won just three league matches; Meredith featured in each win. Back at Chirk, Meredith gained his first honour as part of the team that beat Westminster Rovers to win the 1894 Welsh Cup.|$|E

50|$|The ACCC instituted {{proceedings}} against Air France seeking {{penalties for}} alleged price fixing between early 2003 and 2006.

The ACCC alleged the airline reached <b>understandings</b> <b>with</b> other international airlines {{in relation to the}} imposition of fuel surcharges applied to international carriage of air cargo during that period between early 2003 and 2006. Air France admitted to making and giving effect to illegal price fixing <b>understandings</b> <b>with</b> Lufthansa, repeatedly exchanging assurances with Lufthansa in the implementation of fuel surcharge increases for international carriage of air cargo across their global networks.|$|R
