40|$|It {{is known}} that every closed {{oriented}} 3 -manifold is homology cobordant to a hyperbolic 3 -manifold. By contrast we show that many homology cobordism classes contain no Seifert fibered 3 -manifold. This is accomplished by determining the isomorphism type of the rational cohomology ring of all Seifert fibered 3 -manifolds with no 2 -torsion in their first homology. Then we exhibit families of examples of 3 -manifolds (obtained by surgery on links), with fixed linking form and cohomology ring, that are not homology cobordant to any Seifert fibered space (as shown by their rational cohomology ring). These examples are shown to represent distinct homology cobordism classes using higher Massey products and Milnor's <b>u-invariants</b> for links...|$|R

Moreover, we study a natural action of B_r,s^n(q) = B_r,s^n(q^- 1 -q,q^n,[n]_q) on mixed tensor space and prove that the kernel is free over the ground ring R of rank independent of R. As an application, we prove one side of Schur [...] Weyl duality for mixed tensor space: the image of B_r,s^n(q) in the R-endomorphism ring of mixed tensor space is, for all choices of R and the parameter q, the endomorphism algebra of {{the action of the}} (specialized via the Lusztig integral form) quantized enveloping algebra U of the general linear Lie algebra gl_n on mixed tensor space.

If π is a smooth R[G]-representation, {{the space of}} invariants π^U is a right module over the Hecke algebra H of U in G. Let P be a parabolic subgroup of G with a Levi decomposition P = MN adapted to U. We complement previous investigation of Ollivier-Vignéras on the relation between taking <b>U-invariants</b> and various functor like Ind_P^G and right and left adjoints. More precisely the authors' previous work with Herzig introduce representations I_G(P,σ,Q) where σ is a smooth representation of M extending, trivially on N, to a larger parabolic subgroup P(σ), and Q is a parabolic subgroup between P and P(σ). Here we relate I_G(P,σ,Q) ^U to an analogously defined H-module I_H(P,σ^U_M,Q), where U_M = U∩ M and σ^U_M {{is seen as a}} module over the Hecke algebra H_M of U_M in M. In the reverse direction, if V is a right H_M-module, we relate I_H(P,V,Q) ⊗c-Ind_U^G 1 to I_G(P,V⊗_H_Mc-Ind_U_M^M 1,Q). As an application we prove that if R is an algebraically closed field of characteristic p, and π is an irreducible admissible representation of G, then the contragredient of π is 0 unless π has finite dimension.
