500|$|On hearing Amfortas' cry, {{the youth}} appears to suffer with him, {{clutching}} at his heart. The knights and Titurel urge Amfortas {{to reveal the}} Grail (""), and he finally does. The dark hall is now bathed {{in the light of}} the Grail as the Knights eat. Gurnemanz motions to the youth to participate, but he seems entranced and does not. Amfortas does not share in taking communion and, as the ceremony ends, collapses in pain and is carried away. Slowly the hall empties leaving only the young man and Gurnemanz, who asks him if he has <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has seen. When the lad cannot answer, Gurnemanz dismisses him as just a fool and sends him out with a warning to hunt geese, if he must, but to leave the swans alone. A voice from high above repeats the promise: [...] "The pure fool, enlightened by compassion".|$|E
2500|$|According to Antonia Parvanova, {{one of the}} {{difficulties}} of dealing legally {{with the issue of}} DV is that men in many male dominated societies do not understand that inflicting violence against their wives is against the law. She said, referring to a case that occurred in Bulgaria, [...] "A husband was tried for severely beating his wife and when the judge asked him if he <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did and if he's sorry, the husband said [...] "But she's my wife". He doesn't even understand that he has no right to beat her." [...] UNFPA writes that: ...|$|E

2500|$|The Daily Telegraph {{journalist}} David Howell {{remarked to}} Andrew Alexander that Powell had [...] "just withdrawn us from East of Suez, and received an enormous ovation because no-one <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was talking about". However, the Americans were worried by Powell's speech as they wanted British military commitments in South-East Asia {{as they were}} still fighting in Vietnam. A transcript of the speech was sent to Washington and the American embassy requested to talk to Heath about the [...] "Powell doctrine". The New York Times said Powell's speech was [...] "a potential declaration of independence from American policy". During the election campaign of 1966, Powell claimed that the British government had contingency plans to send at least a token British force to Vietnam and that, under Labour, Britain [...] "has behaved perfectly clearly and perfectly recognisably as an American satellite".|$|E
2500|$|They {{focused on}} a genealogical error in The Contention, which they argue seems {{unlikely}} {{to have been made}} by an author, and is therefore only attributable to a reporter. In The Contention, when York sets out his claim to the throne, he identifies Edmund of Langley as Edward III's second son, instead of his fifth. In 2 Henry VI, Langley is correctly placed in the genealogy. This error renders unnecessary York's need to claim the throne through his mother's ancestry: were he descended from the second son, he himself would be descended directly from an elder son than Henry. It has been argued that [...] "no one who <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was writing – that is, no author – could have made this error, but someone parroting someone else's work, of which he himself had but a dim understanding – that is, a reporter – easily could." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 23 February 2010, Tebbit was {{alleged to}} have {{attacked}} a ceremonial Chinese dragon during a Chinese New Year parade. He {{is said to have}} been unaware it was Chinese New Year and to have [...] "kicked the rear of a child who was dressed in the traditional costume of a dragon". Tebbit later said: [...] "I don't think my reaction was extreme at all. I placed my hand on the drum so I could diminish the noise and asked the drummer what was going on and got a rap on the knuckles for my pain. I was then barged by the dragon. I barged it back and might have done something like kick it. I wasn't sure how to deal with it. I've never been barged by a dragon before". A local Conservative town councillor, Mr Chung, visited Tebbit the day after the incident and received an apology. Chung said: [...] "I said his actions were upsetting. He apologised. He only then <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done".|$|E

2500|$|This {{explains}} {{that it was}} Lord Scales' daughter (Elizabeth de Scales) who was to marry Lady Grey's brother (Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl of Rivers), and Lady Grey's son (Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset) who was to marry the daughter of Lord Bonville (Cecily Bonville). As such, based on the inconsistency between Scales marrying Bonfield's daughter in True Tragedy and Scales' daughter marrying Grey's brother in 3 Henry VI, Alexander argued that {{the representation of the}} scene in True Tragedy is completely nonsensical and probably came about because the reporter became confused about who was married whom. Furthermore, unlike the account in True Tragedy, the version in 3 Henry VI corresponds closely to the chronicle material found in Hall ("the heir of the Lord Scales [...] hath married to his wife's brother, the heir also of the Lord Bonville and Harrington he hath given to his wife's son, and the heir of the Lord Hungerford he hath granted to the Lord Hastings"). In relation to mistakes like this, {{it has been argued that}} [...] "no one who <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was writing, that is – no author – could have made such error, but someone parroting someone else's work of which he himself had but a dim understanding – that is, a reporter – could have." ...|$|E
2500|$|The episode [...] "Uncertainty Principle" [...] is {{significant}} for the backstory it gives on the familial relationships, particularly Charlie's difficulty in dealing with his mother's death from cancer. While it's unclear how Don reacted, Charlie spent {{the last three months}} of his mother's life isolated in the garage, incessantly working on one of the Millennium Prize Problems, specifically P vs NP; it's a point of contention between the brothers. Also, Charlie doesn't think Don <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> went through during their school years, especially how he was treated as [...] "Don's brainiac little brother" [...] by his peers in high school, and how he often left him to his own resources as a child, though he was not as inept as Don had reasoned. However, Charlie's relationship with Don remains strong, as he has begun to increasingly fear for his brother's safety on the job and still looks to his older brother for acceptance. Charlie and his father worry about Don committing to relationships, and for a time, fear that he had been cheating on Robin Brooks. Ironically, Charlie has similar problems with women himself. After a couple dozen murder cases, Charlie is somewhat jaded and world-weary like his brother. FBI agent David Sinclair of Don's team even comments that he has never seen two brothers so similar and yet so different. In [...] "The Janus List", the brothers seem to take on each other's tendencies a bit. Though, in season five, Charlie is dismayed that Don does not reveal to him his newfound religious faith.|$|E
