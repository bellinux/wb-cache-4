40|$|Abstract:- Heterogeneous {{devices have}} been adopted widely in mobile storage systems because a {{combination}} of such devices can supply a synergistically <b>useful</b> <b>storage</b> solution {{by taking advantage of}} each device. In heterogeneous storage systems there have been several researches for enhancing I/O performance by devising proper buffer cache management algorithms. This paper presents a novel device-aware buffer cache management algorithm by employing adaptive cache replacement called ARC, considering both I/O cost per device and workload patterns in mobile computing systems with a heterogeneous storage pair of a hard disk and a NAND flash memory. The proposed algorithm seeks to enhance an existing device-aware cache partitioning technique. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm reduces the total I/O cost over the existing buffer cache algorithms on typical mobile traces.

40|$|A greedy method, for {{choosing}} an optimum reduced {{set of control}} points, is integrated with radial basis function interpolation and evaluated {{for the purpose of}} interpolating large volume data sets in CFD. Given a function defined at a set of points, the greedy method selects a small subset of these points that is sufficient to keep the interpolation error at all the remaining points below a chosen bound. This is equivalent to a type of data compression, and would have <b>useful</b> <b>storage,</b> post-processing and computational applications in CFD. To test the method in terms of both the point selection scheme and the suitability of reduced control point volume interpolation, a trial application of the interpolation to velocity fields in CFD volume meshes is considered. To optimise the point selection process, and attempt to be able to capture multiple length scales, a variable support radius formulation has also been included. Structured and unstructured mesh cases are considered for aerofoils, a wing case, and a wing-body case. For smooth volume functions the method is shown to work extremely well, producing accurate velocity interpolations using {{a very small number of}} the cells in the mesh. For general complex fields, i. e. non-smooth and including large gradients at multiple length scales, the method is still shown to be effective and, significantly, the accuracy of the method appears independent of mesh size.

This secondary particle flux can be exploited to provide a <b>useful</b> <b>storage</b> ring operations tool for optimization of luminosity.
