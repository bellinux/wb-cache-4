5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} may {{be diagnosed}} when {{the combination of}} hyperglycemia (high blood sugars), ketones in the blood or on <b>urinalysis</b> and acidosis are demonstrated. In about 10% of cases the blood sugar is not significantly elevated ("euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis").|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the above, blood samples are usually taken to measure urea and creatinine (measures of kidney function, which may be impaired in DKA {{as a result of}} dehydration) and electrolytes. Furthermore, markers of infection (complete blood count, C-reactive protein) and acute pancreatitis (amylase and lipase) may be measured. Given the need to exclude infection, chest radiography and <b>urinalysis</b> are usually performed.|$|E
5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on <b>urinalysis)</b> {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on <b>urinalysis</b> may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force {{monitored}} airborne contamination through nasal swabs of onsite personnel. Of the 9,837 nasal swabs taken, 335 samples had detectable {{levels of}} alpha particle activity, although none was above acceptable levels. <b>Urinalysis</b> was also performed {{but none of}} the 756 samples displayed any detectable level of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|A {{physical}} examination and medical history {{are generally not}} enough to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious bursitis; aspiration of the bursal fluid is often required for this, along with a cell culture and Gram stain of the aspirated fluid. Septic prepatellar bursitis may be diagnosed if the fluid is {{found to have a}} neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter, a threshold significantly lower than that of septic arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter). A tuberculosis infection can be confirmed using a roentgenogram and <b>urinalysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} supportive; gastric {{decontamination}} with activated charcoal {{may be beneficial}} if medical attention is sought {{within a few hours}} of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, <b>urinalysis,</b> and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.|$|E
25|$|<b>Urinalysis</b> tests urine {{for many}} analytes. Some health care {{providers}} have a <b>urinalysis</b> laboratory, while others don't. Instead, each component of the <b>urinalysis</b> is performed at the corresponding unit. If measuring urine chemicals is required, the specimen is processed in the clinical biochemistry lab, but if cell studies are indicated, the specimen should be submitted to the cytopathology lab, and so on.|$|E
25|$|Anatomic {{pathology}} {{relates to}} the processing, examination, and diagnosis of surgical specimens by a physician trained in pathological diagnosis. Clinical pathology is the division that processes the test requests more familiar to the general public; such as blood cell counts, coagulation studies, <b>urinalysis,</b> blood glucose level determinations and throat cultures. Its subsections include chemistry, hematology, microbiology, immunology, <b>urinalysis</b> and blood bank.|$|E
25|$|<b>Urinalysis</b> {{may show}} {{white blood cells}} and protein in the urine (pyuria and proteinuria) without {{evidence}} of bacterial growth.|$|E
25|$|Sherk next fought Frankie Edgar at UFC 98 losing via {{unanimous}} decision. Sherk again {{found himself}} in trouble with an athletic commission post fight, after he ran from the arena while still in his fight shorts and no shirt before supplying a post fight <b>urinalysis.</b> He was contacted by commission officer Keith Kizer and told {{to return to the}} arena immediately or face his license being revoked. Sherk returned within the hour and provided a <b>urinalysis</b> and tested clean, but was still suspended 45 days for the actions.|$|E
25|$|An acute sickle-cell {{crisis is}} often precipitated by infection. Therefore, a <b>urinalysis</b> to detect an occult urinary tract infection, and chest X-ray {{to look for}} occult {{pneumonia}} should be routinely performed.|$|E
25|$|Patients are {{referred}} to nephrology specialists after a <b>urinalysis,</b> for various reasons, such as acute kidney failure, chronic kidney disease, hematuria, proteinuria, kidney stones, hypertension, and disorders of acid/base or electrolytes.|$|E
25|$|To {{distinguish}} DI {{from other}} causes of excess urination, blood glucose levels, bicarbonate levels, and calcium levels {{need to be}} tested. Measurement of blood electrolytes can reveal a high sodium level (hypernatremia as dehydration develops). <b>Urinalysis</b> demonstrates a dilute urine with a low specific gravity. Urine osmolarity and electrolyte levels are typically low.|$|E
25|$|Several {{tests can}} {{identify}} the cause of CAP. Blood cultures can isolate bacteria or fungi in the bloodstream. Sputum Gram staining and culture can also reveal the causative microorganism. In severe cases, bronchoscopy can collect fluid for culture. Special tests can be performed if an uncommon microorganism is suspected, such as <b>urinalysis</b> for Legionella antigen in Legionnaires' disease.|$|E
25|$|Cellular {{metabolism}} generates numerous by-products, many nitrogenous (rich in nitrogen), {{that require}} clearance from the bloodstream. These by-products are eventually {{expelled from the}} body during urination, the primary method for excreting water-soluble chemicals from the body. These chemicals can be detected and analyzed by <b>urinalysis.</b> Of the many such substances that exist, the three main nitrogenous wastes of the mammalian body are urea, uric acid, and creatinine.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} {{of blood in}} urine is a common presumptive sign of renal cell carcinoma. The haemoglobin of the blood causes the urine to be rusty, brown or red in colour. Alternatively, <b>urinalysis</b> can test for sugar, protein and bacteria which can also serve as indicators for cancer. A complete blood cell count can also provide additional information regarding the severity and spreading of the cancer.|$|E
25|$|Kidney {{function}} is tested for using blood tests and urine tests. A usual blood test is for urea and electrolytes, {{known as a}} U and E. Creatinine is also tested for. Urine tests such as <b>urinalysis</b> can evaluate for pH, protein, glucose, {{and the presence of}} blood. Microscopic analysis can also identify the presence of urinary casts and crystals. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be calculated.|$|E
25|$|Examination of {{the urine}} (<b>urinalysis)</b> allows a direct {{assessment}} for possible kidney problems, {{which may be}} suggested by appearance {{of blood in the}} urine (haematuria), protein in the urine (proteinuria), pus cells in the urine (pyuria) or cancer cells in the urine. A 24-hour urine collection can be used to quantify daily protein loss (see proteinuria), urine output, creatinine clearance or electrolyte handling by the renal tubules.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} kidney injuries {{induced by}} analgesics are {{renal papillary necrosis}} and chronic interstitial nephritis. They appear to result from decreased {{blood flow to the}} kidney, rapid consumption of antioxidants, and subsequent oxidative damage to the kidney. This kidney damage may lead to progressive chronic kidney failure, abnormal <b>urinalysis</b> results, high blood pressure, and anemia. A small proportion of individuals with analgesic nephropathy may develop end-stage kidney disease.|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{veterinary}} hospital {{is responsible for}} disease prevention and health care management of the park's captive population. The hospital has a well-equipped operation theatre, in-patient ward, radiology unit, laboratory, clinical room, pathology room, quarantine facilities and convalescent yard fully functional to cater the needs of complete animal health care. It also includes a modern diagnostic laboratory with facility for periodic coprological examination, identification of causative organism, antibiotic sensitivity, pregnancy diagnosis, haematology, serology and <b>urinalysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Detectable {{levels of}} propoxyphene/dextropropoxyphene may {{stay in a}} person's system for up to 9 days after last dose and can be tested for {{specifically}} in nonstandard <b>urinalysis,</b> but may remain in the body longer in minuscule amounts. Propoxyphene will not show up on standard opiate/opioid tests {{because it is not}} chemically related to opiates as part of the OPI or OPI 2000 panels, which detect morphine and related compounds. It is most closely related to methadone.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s the {{administration}} of President Ronald Reagan proposed {{to put an end}} to drug abuse in the trucking industry by means of the then-recently developed technique of <b>urinalysis,</b> with his signing of Executive Order 12564, requiring regular random drug testing of all truck drivers nationwide, as well as employees of other DOT-regulated industries specified in the order, though considerations had to be made concerning the effects of an excessively rapid implementation of the measure.|$|E
25|$|Non-registered staff {{carry out}} a number of roles, often working in direct patient care (often on wards), {{performing}} tasks such as personal care (washing and dressing), social care (feeding, communicating to patients and generally spending time with them) and more specialised tasks such as recording observations or vital signs (such as temperature, pulse and respiratory rate, or TPR) or measuring and assessing blood pressure, <b>urinalysis,</b> blood glucose monitoring, pressure sores (see Waterlow score) and carrying out procedures such as catheterisation and cannulation).|$|E
25|$|Since Scalia's opinion had {{provided}} the case's deciding vote, either it or the plurality {{could be used}} by lower courts until another such case were to come to the court and force a resolution of the question. The court would consider the Fourth Amendment rights of public employees again two years later, in 1989's Treasury Employees v. Von Raab. In that case another divided court upheld the Customs Service's requirement that applicants for positions that involved carrying a firearm and the possibility of drug interdiction undergo drug tests by <b>urinalysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} comes {{mostly from}} the history and examination, but the following special investigations may be involved: blood tests (vitamin deficiency, anemia, leukemia, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV infection, diabetes) microbiological swabs (infection), or <b>urinalysis</b> (diabetes). A biopsy (minor procedure to cut out {{a small sample of}} the ulcer to look at under a microscope) with or without immunofluorescence may be required, to rule out cancer, but also if a systemic disease is suspected. Ulcers caused by local trauma are painful to touch and sore. They usually have an irregular border with erythematous margins and the base is yellow. As healing progresses, a keratotic (thickened, white mucosa) halo may occur.|$|E
25|$|Most {{federal appeals}} courts have {{ruled that a}} single {{positive}} <b>urinalysis</b> constitutes possession of a controlled substance warranting supervised release revocation, resulting in him being sentenced to a prison term of at least one-third the supervised release term, {{although it has been}} argued that the legislative history indicates that Congress did not intend this interpretation. The federal government considers the use of medical cannabis by probationers to be a violation. The court is not prohibited from considering the results of a drug test that shows presence of cocaine metabolites in the defendant's urine, albeit a level that is below what the contract between the testing laboratory and the Administrative Office of United States Courts requires for a positive test.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} is {{identified}} by {{a blood test}} for creatinine, which is a breakdown product of muscle metabolism. Higher levels of creatinine indicate a lower glomerular filtration rate {{and as a result}} a decreased capability of the kidneys to excrete waste products. Creatinine levels may be normal {{in the early stages of}} CKD, and the condition is discovered if <b>urinalysis</b> (testing of a urine sample) shows the kidney is allowing the loss of protein or red blood cells into the urine. To fully investigate the underlying cause of kidney damage, various forms of medical imaging, blood tests, and sometimes a kidney biopsy (removing a small sample of kidney tissue) are employed to find out if a reversible cause for the kidney malfunction is present.|$|E
25|$|Some medical {{systems have}} a {{practice}} of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly. In fact, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against routine pre-operative chest x-rays for patients who have an unremarkable medical history and presented with a physical exam which did not indicate a chest x-ray. Routine x-ray examination {{is more likely to}} result in problems like misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or other negative outcomes than it is to result in a benefit to the patient. Likewise, other tests including complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, basic metabolic panel, and <b>urinalysis</b> should not be done unless the results of these tests can help evaluate surgical risk.|$|E
25|$|Men are {{affected}} {{three times as}} often as women. There is also marked geographic variation in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy throughout the world. It {{is the most common}} glomerular disease in the Far East and Southeast Asia, accounting for almost half of all the patients with glomerular disease. However, it accounts for only about 25% of the proportion in European and about 10% among North Americans, with African–Americans having a very low prevalence of about 2%. However, a confounding factor in this analysis is the existing policy of screening and use of kidney biopsy as an investigative tool. School children in Japan undergo routine <b>urinalysis</b> (as do army recruits in Singapore) and any suspicious abnormality is pursued with a kidney biopsy, which might partly explain the high observed incidence of IgA nephropathy in those countries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Urinalysis</b> is {{typically}} performed when LUTS are present and BPH is suspected to evaluate {{for signs of}} a urinary tract infection, glucose in the urine (suggestive of diabetes), or protein in the urine (suggestive of kidney disease). Bloodwork including kidney function tests and prostate specific antigen (PSA) are often ordered to evaluate for kidney damage and prostate cancer, respectively. However, checking blood PSA levels for prostate cancer screening is controversial and not necessarily indicated in every evaluation for BPH. Benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are both capable of increasing blood PSA levels and PSA elevation is unable to differentiate these two conditions well. If PSA levels are checked and are high, then further investigation is warranted. Measures including PSA density, free PSA, rectal examination, and transrectal ultrasonography may be helpful in determining whether a PSA increase is due to BPH or prostate cancer. Ultrasound examination of the testes, prostate, and kidneys is often performed, again to rule out cancer and hydronephrosis.|$|E
25|$|Many {{physicians}} in ancient history resorted to the inspection and {{examination of the}} urine of their patients. Hermogenes wrote about the color and other attributes of urine as indicators of certain diseases. Abdul Malik Ibn Habib of Andalusia d.862 AD, mentions numerous reports of urine examination throughout the Umayyad empire. Diabetes mellitus got its name because the urine is plentiful and sweet. The name uroscopy refers to any visual examination of the urine, including microscopy, although it often refers to the aforementioned prescientific or protoscientific forms of urine examination. Clinical urine tests today duly note the gross color, turbidity, and odor of urine but also include <b>urinalysis,</b> which chemically analyzes the urine and quantifies its constituents. A culture of the urine is performed when a urinary tract infection is suspected, as bacteria in the urine are unusual otherwise. A microscopic examination of the urine {{may be helpful to}} identify organic or inorganic substrates and help in the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|For {{an adult}} patient with {{isolated}} hematuria, tests such as ultrasound of the kidney and cystoscopy are usually done first {{to pinpoint the}} source of the bleeding. These tests would rule out kidney stones and bladder cancer, two other common urological causes of hematuria. In children and younger adults, the history and association with respiratory infection can raise the suspicion of IgA nephropathy. A kidney biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy specimen shows proliferation of the mesangium, with IgA deposits on immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. However, patients with isolated microscopic hematuria (i.e. without associated proteinuria and with normal kidney function) are not usually biopsied since this is associated with an excellent prognosis. A <b>urinalysis</b> will show red blood cells, usually as red cell urinary casts. Proteinuria, usually less than 2grams per day, also may be present. Other renal causes of isolated hematuria include thin basement membrane disease and Alport syndrome, the latter being a hereditary disease associated with hearing impairment and eye problems.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hyposalivation is based predominantly on the clinical signs and symptoms. There is little correlation between symptoms and objective tests of salivary flow, such as sialometry. This test {{is simple and}} noninvasive, and involves measurement of all the saliva a patient can produce during a certain time, achieved by dribbling into a container. Sialometery can yield measures of stimulated salivary flow or unstimulated salivary flow. Stimulated salivary flow rate is calculated using a stimulant such as 10% citric acid dropped onto the tongue, and collection of all the saliva that flows {{from one of the}} parotid papillae over five or ten minutes. Unstimulated whole saliva flow rate more closely correlates with symptoms of xerostomia than stimulated salivary flow rate. Sialography involves introduction of radio-opaque dye such as iodine into the duct of a salivary gland. It may show blockage of a duct due to a calculus. Salivary scintiscanning using technetium is rarely used. Other medical imaging that may be involved in the investigation include chest x-ray (to exclude sarcoidosis), ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (to exclude Sjögren's syndrome or neoplasia). A minor salivary gland biopsy, usually taken from the lip, may be carried out if there is a suspicion of organic disease of the salivary glands. Blood tests and <b>urinalysis</b> may be involved to exclude a number of possible causes. To investigate xerophthalmia, the Schirmer test of lacrimal flow may be indicated. Slit-lamp examination may also be carried out.|$|E
500|$|Once the {{diagnosis}} of encephalopathy has been made, efforts are made to exclude underlying causes (such as listed above in [...] "causes"). This requires blood tests (urea and electrolytes, full blood count, liver function tests), usually a chest X-ray, and <b>urinalysis.</b> If there is ascites, diagnostic paracentesis (removal of a fluid sample with a needle) {{may be required to}} identify spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).|$|E
500|$|In {{straightforward}} cases, {{a diagnosis}} {{may be made}} and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation. In complicated or questionable cases, {{it may be useful}} to confirm the diagnosis via <b>urinalysis,</b> looking for the presence of urinary nitrites, white blood cells (leukocytes), or leukocyte esterase. [...] Another test, urine microscopy, looks for the presence of red blood cells, white blood cells, or bacteria. Urine culture is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of {{greater than or equal to}} 103 colony-forming units per mL of a typical urinary tract organism. Antibiotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures, making them useful in the selection of antibiotic treatment. However, women with negative cultures may still improve with antibiotic treatment. As symptoms can be vague and without reliable tests for urinary tract infections, diagnosis can be difficult in the elderly.|$|E
500|$|The clinic was {{equipped}} and staffed by physicians specializing in family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, and psychiatry. The clinic operated {{primarily as a}} walk-in clinic where patients could see a doctor for all complaints and receive free medication. Due {{to the lack of}} a functioning emergency room the clinic was sometimes utilized as a facility to stabilize a patient while an ambulance was en route to transport the patient to an emergency room. The closest hospitals were [...] to the west at the Louisiana Heart Hospital in Lacombe, Louisiana or the Northshore Medical Center in Slidell, Louisiana, or [...] to the east at the Gulfport Memorial Hospital in Gulfport, Mississippi. The local hospital, Hancock County Medical Center, was incapacitated due to the hurricane. There were no X-ray or blood laboratory available with the exception of <b>urinalysis</b> testing strips and glucometers. As such physicians were described to be practicing battlefield medicine in a M.A.S.H. unit.|$|E
