The aim was to study the correlation between spatial distribution of <b>urban</b> public <b>facilities</b> and settlement pattern. To obtain the settlement pattern and <b>urban</b> <b>facilities</b> distribution, manual photo interpretation and field survey method were used. The data were analyzed using geographi information system and statistical analysis tools. Map overlay module in the P Ar/ Info was used in order to join each variables of this research. To know the correlation between spatial distribution of <b>urban</b> <b>facilities</b> and settlement pattern, the multiple regression technique was used. The result shows that there was a positive signifiant relationship between <b>urban</b> public <b>facilities</b> distribution and settlement pattern. It means that the more distributed of <b>urban</b> publi <b>facilities</b> the better of settlement pattern (dense – uniform – large size building).

Innovative {{buildings}} and structures are architectural objects, the distinguishing feature {{of which is the}} presence of certain levels of their formation - material and functional (provided certain functional purpose object and its material embodiment), art-shaped (the presence of an individual artistic image) structural and process (use of new technologies and fundamentally new design); communication and of environmental (harmonious integration of the object in the environment). Absence of analogues - a prerequisite for innovative buildings. Innovative architectural and urban objects created in the development of civilization. Innovations in design and construction of architectural and <b>urban</b> <b>facilities</b> - this is the final result of the creation (design) and development (implementation) of a fundamentally new or modified facility satisfies human needs.

From there the potential action and activity spaces of individuals in four suburbs are delimited, and these are used in assessing the variations in access to and choice between facilities in these suburbs.

40|$|Two {{measurements}} are employed to quantitatively investigate the scaling {{properties of the}} spatial distribution of <b>urban</b> <b>facilities,</b> the K function by number counting and the variance-mean relationship with the method of expanding bins.

Further analysis of more data (which includes 8 types of facilities in 37 major Chinese cities) shows that the exponents of the power function do not have systematic variations across facilities and cities, which suggests {{the possibility that the}} scaling rule is universal. A double stochastic process (DSP) model is proposed such that the two empirical results can both be embedded. Simulation of DSP yields better agreement with the urban data than of the correlated percolation model. Comment: 17 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

The still existing Musikpavillon was built by the Robert Maillard in 1908, and has excellent acoustics. The site's increasing use and the ageing of the trees forced the city government to develop a new design concept, which was based on the idea of redesigning this important market and venue area as a single tree-lined square.

For <b>urban</b> <b>facilities,</b> such as buildings, energy performance audits could be conducted by detailed evaluation at building level. However, at urban level, detailed evaluation is cost and time intensive. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the correlation between land surface temperature, obtained through satellite imagery, and energy consumption patterns at urban level to explore its feasibility for energy performance evaluations. New York City was used as the main case study for conducting the analysis. We have investigated the correlation between energy consumption intensity and temperature at city block level for selected points. The outcome demonstrates a strong correlation between energy consumption intensity and land surface temperature. The observed correlation could potentially be leveraged for developing an approach for energy performance auditing. </p...|$|R
50|$|Some {{hospitals}} have installed teleconferencing systems that allow {{doctors and nurses}} at a central facility (either in the same building, at a central location serving several local hospitals, or in rural locations another more <b>urban</b> <b>facility)</b> to collaborate with on-site staff and speak with patients (a form of telemedicine). This is variously called an eICU, virtual ICU, or tele-ICU. Remote staff typically have access to vital signs from live monitoring equipment, and to electronic health records {{so they can get}} a broader view of a patient's medical history. Often bedside and remote staff have met in person and may rotate responsibilities. Such systems allow hospitals to double-check that correct procedures are being followed for the patients most vulnerable to mistakes, and to use access expertise remotely to keep patients that would otherwise have to be transferred to a larger facility, and have demonstrated a significant decrease in mortality.|$|E

40|$|The author {{introduces}} a decision method for facilitating physical planning and other decision processes at central government level, {{at the same}} time, taking into account some justified differences in local needs {{for the provision of}} <b>urban</b> <b>facilities.</b> The method considers the following factors influencing local needs: the number of urban inhabitants; the influence of larger cities (metropolises); and the number of inhabitants to be served in the hinterland of a city. The nationwide standard accepted for <b>urban</b> <b>facilities</b> is first differentiated according to city size, and for any specific city, i, it is further modified by the coefficient a iL, expressing the local deviations of the factors. The coefficient a iL is constructed from the ratios of 'real' local values of the factors to the 'a priori' values derived from a regular model of the settlement network in a larger territorial unit. The method is operationalised without any special technical aids, the 'a priori' values being tabulated or expressed by nomograms. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{one-fifth of}} the United States {{population}} is rural, {{little is known about}} the characteristics and outcomes of rural dialysis patients. We measured the association of rural residence with patient characteristics, survival, and time to transplant among 552 [*] 279 patients who initiated dialysis between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2002 and survived more than 90 days. We also examined the characteristics of 4363 Medicare-certified dialysis facilities by degree of rurality. Compared with urban patients, rural dialysis patients were older, less racially diverse with a higher prevalence of most co-morbid conditions. Hemodialysis was the dominant modality in both urban and rural areas, although the use of peritoneal dialysis was more frequent in rural areas. Survival and time to transplant differed by racial–ethnic group. Most notably, despite slightly better survival associated with rural vs urban residence among black popultions, black populations living in rural areas were less likely to be transplanted than their urban counterparts (and than any other group examined). Compared with <b>urban</b> <b>facilities,</b> rural facilities are smaller, less likely to be for profit or owned by a large chain. Nonetheless, rural facilities perform at least as well as <b>urban</b> <b>facilities</b> based on standard performance measures.
