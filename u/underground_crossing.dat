25|$|This {{proposed}} future route {{would cross}} the downtown core {{at right angles}} to the downtown transit mall and connect two new legs: the Southeast leg and the North-Central leg. It would exceed the capacity of the downtown transit mall, requiring that it use a new right of way going over or under the existing transit mall. Elevated tracks would conflict with Calgary's downtown +15 system, which is the most extensive pedestrian skywalk system in the world, so this option is unlikely. Most likely the system will go <b>underground,</b> <b>crossing</b> underneath the future downtown subway, which already has a short section of tunnel built under 8th Avenue S and a ghost station under the Calgary Municipal Building. The exact routes and station locations are currently in the planning stages.|$|E

50|$|At level -1 {{lies the}} large {{entrance}} hall that has {{about the same}} size as the Teniersplaats. The hall contains a large number of pillars as well as a single newspaper stand. Along the walls of the entrance hall, multiple open spaces can be found, constructed for small shops. However, none of them is currently used. After the renewal of the northern part of the Leien, the hall will be split in two by a newly constructed car tunnel, allowing car traffic to go underneath the Teniersplaats. Consequently, it will no longer be possible to use the hall as an <b>underground</b> <b>crossing</b> of the Leien.|$|E

50|$|In January 2006, the Monash City Council {{agreed in}} {{principle}} to the redevelopment of the transport hub and began to negotiate with VicTrack Access to develop a mixed-use multi storey building located in the forecourt area of the Glen Waverley Railway Station. This development {{is part of the}} Victorian Government's Melbourne 2030 plan. The redevelopment will include a multi-deck car park, multi-story residential and commercial buildings and a pedestrian bridge or <b>underground</b> <b>crossing</b> linking both buildings. The Glen Waverley Railway Station is also planned to be redeveloped. The first stage of redevelopment, entailing preliminary roadworks is due for completion in October 2009. The Kingsway Realignment Project is jointly funded by Monash City Council, the Department of Planning and Community Development's 'Creating Better Places Program' and VicTrack.|$|E

50|$|The {{first part}} of the {{original}} plan to be carried out was the construction of the Oostlijn (East Line), which started in 1970. The East Line links the city centre with the large-scale Bijlmermeer residential developments in the south-east of the city. It opened in 1977. The East Line starts <b>underground,</b> <b>crossing</b> the city centre and adjacent neighbourhouds in the eastern districts until Amsterdam Amstel railway station, where it continues above ground in southeastern direction. At Van der Madeweg metro station, the line splits into two branches: the Gein Branch for Route 54 and Gaasperplas Branch for Route 53. Since 1980, the northern terminus for both routes is Amsterdam Centraal railway station. During the construction of the metro tunnel, the decision to demolish the Nieuwmarkt neighbourhoud in the city centre led to strong protests in the spring of 1975 from action groups consisting of locals and members of the highly active Amsterdam squatting movement. Wall decorations at the Nieuwmarkt metro station are a reference to the protests, which are known as the Nieuwmarkt Riots (Nieuwmarktrellen).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Ground {{settlement}} due {{to construction}} of <b>underground</b> <b>crossing</b> railway bed {{is an important}} issue. In this paper, {{the influence of the}} tunnels depths, the elasticity modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and internal friction angle of the sub grade soil property to the ground settlement during construction is simulated by the numerical simulation method. Some conclusions are drawn. Firstly, the tunnels depth doesn’t only influence the growth of the ground settlements, but also the shape of traverse settler. Secondly, the sub grade soil properties mainly affect the larger settlement; the shape of the settlement trough was relatively small...|$|E
