5|$|Aluminium also forms a lower {{chloride}}, aluminium(I) chloride (AlCl), {{but this}} is very <b>unstable</b> and only known in the vapour phase.|$|E
5|$|For most bikes, {{depending}} on geometry and mass distribution, weave is <b>unstable</b> at low speeds, and becomes less pronounced as speed increases {{until it is}} no longer <b>unstable.</b> While the amplitude may decrease, the frequency actually increases with speed.|$|E
5|$|Gallane is <b>unstable</b> above −10°C, decomposing to {{elemental}} gallium and hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to RNA processing, turnover and surveillance activities, the exosome {{is important for}} the degradation of so-called cryptic <b>unstable</b> transcripts (CUTs) that are produced from thousands of loci within the yeast genome. The importance of these <b>unstable</b> RNAs and their degradation are still unclear, but similar RNA species have also been detected in human cells.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{through a}} study of many lunar {{orbiting}} satellites, scientists came to discover that most low lunar orbits (LLO) are <b>unstable.</b> PFS-2 had been placed, unknown to mission planners at the time, squarely {{into one of the}} most <b>unstable</b> of orbits, at 11 degrees orbital inclination, far from the four frozen lunar orbits discovered only later at 27°, 50°, 76°, and 86° inclination.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} in <b>unstable</b> for a certain length of time {{that depends on the}} urgency of the changes.|$|E
5|$|Nickelocene is known; {{it has an}} {{electron}} count of 20, making it relatively <b>unstable.</b>|$|E

5|$|Shotaro Morikubo/Steve Staley as Kadaj. Morikubo had {{difficulties}} voicing {{him because}} of the character's <b>unstable</b> personality and needed time {{to adjust to the}} role.|$|E
5|$|Testing is the preview branch {{that will}} {{eventually}} become the next major release. The packages included in this branch have had some testing in <b>unstable</b> {{but they may not}} be fit for release yet. It contains newer packages than stable but older than <b>unstable.</b> This branch is updated continually until it is frozen. Testings CDs and DVDs {{can be found on the}} Debian website.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish made {{driftwood}} rafts {{to cross}} the Rio Grande. They lost their crossbows when the <b>unstable</b> rafts tipped.|$|E
5|$|The {{game had}} some {{technical}} problems {{when it was}} released. Tyrrel noted an <b>unstable</b> frame rate and occasional texture pop-up, and Kollar identified audio problems.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{outdated}} versions in <b>unstable</b> for any release ports.|$|E
5|$|With unarticulated wheels, {{climbing}} obstacles {{will cause}} {{the body of a}} vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle will become statically <b>unstable,</b> and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically <b>unstable,</b> meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.|$|E
5|$|After Samus {{retrieves}} {{three pieces}} of the Light of Aether, she enters the Ing's Sky Temple and faces the Emperor Ing, the strongest Ing who guards the remaining Light of Aether. Samus defeats the creature and retrieves the last remaining energy, causing Dark Aether to become critically <b>unstable</b> and collapse; however, her path out of the temple is blocked by a horribly altered and <b>unstable</b> Dark Samus. After defeating her foe, Samus escapes as the dark world disappears around her. Returning to U-Mos, she finds that the Luminoth were {{in a state of}} hibernation but have now awakened. After a brief celebration, Samus leaves Aether in her repaired gunship. If the player completes the game with all of the items collected, Dark Samus is shown reforming herself above Aether.|$|E
5|$|All four simple {{nitrogen}} trihalides are known. A few mixed halides and hydrohalides are known, but {{are mostly}} <b>unstable</b> and uninteresting: examples include NClF2, NCl2F, NBrF2, NF2H, NCl2H, and NClH2.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{dissolving}} in the water, {{oxygen and}} other gases {{are trapped in}} a type of structure called a clathrate. In clathrate structures, gases are enclosed in an icy cage and look like packed snow. These structures form at the high-pressure depths of Lake Vostok and would become <b>unstable</b> if brought to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Caleb Swanigan, born April 18, 1997, {{grew up in}} an <b>unstable</b> home due to his father, Carl Swanigan Sr., who had a {{crack cocaine}} addiction. Swanigan's mother, Tanya, had six children. Swanigan moved between Utah and Indianapolis, Indiana during his youth, {{spending}} time in homeless shelters.|$|E
5|$|Carbenes that {{formally}} {{derive from}} imidazole-2-ylidenes by substitution of sulfur, oxygen, or other chalcogens for both α-nitrogens {{are expected to}} be <b>unstable,</b> as they have the potential to dissociate into an alkyne (R1C≡CR2) and a carbon dichalcogenide (X1=C=X2).|$|E
5|$|Cometary orbits around Jupiter are <b>unstable,</b> as {{they will}} be highly {{elliptical}} and likely to be strongly perturbed by the Sun's gravity at apojove (the furthest point on the orbit from the planet).|$|E
5|$|Dissolving praseodymium(IV) {{compounds}} in water results in solutions containing the yellow Pr4+ ions; {{because of the}} high positive standard reduction potential of the Pr4+/Pr3+ couple at +3.2V, these ions are <b>unstable</b> in aqueous solution, oxidising water and being reduced to Pr3+. The value for the Pr3+/Pr couple is −2.35V.|$|E
5|$|Every element has {{one or more}} {{isotopes}} {{that have}} <b>unstable</b> nuclei that are subject to radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation. Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances {{on the order of}} 1fm.|$|E
5|$|Experimental is a {{temporary}} staging area of highly experimental software {{that is likely to}} break the system. It is not a full distribution and missing dependencies are commonly found in <b>unstable,</b> where new software without the damage chance is normally uploaded.|$|E
5|$|For most bikes, {{depending}} on geometry and mass distribution, capsize is stable at low speeds, and becomes less stable as speed increases {{until it is}} no longer stable. However, on many bikes, tire interaction with the pavement is sufficient to prevent capsize from becoming <b>unstable</b> at high speeds.|$|E
5|$|In {{absence of}} other ligands, its aqueous {{solutions}} are <b>unstable</b> {{with respect to}} disproportionation into Cu and CuCl2. In part for this reason samples in air assume a green coloration (see photograph in upper right).|$|E
5|$|In some of {{the more}} {{politically}} <b>unstable</b> central African and west African countries, revolutionary groups have taken control of diamond mines, using proceeds from diamond sales to finance their operations. Diamonds sold through this process are known as conflict diamonds or blood diamonds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1944 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, McClintock began {{systematic}} studies on the mechanisms of the mosaic color patterns of maize seed and the <b>unstable</b> inheritance of this mosaicism. She identified two new dominant and interacting genetic loci that she named Dissociator (Ds) and Activator (Ac). She found that the Dissociator did not just dissociate or cause the chromosome to break, it also had a variety of effects on neighboring genes when the Activator was also present, which included making certain stable mutations <b>unstable.</b> In early 1948, she made the surprising discovery that both Dissociator and Activator could transpose, or change position, on the chromosome.|$|E
5|$|Indium(I) {{compounds}} are not common. The chloride, bromide, and iodide {{are deeply}} colored, unlike the parent trihalides {{from which they}} are prepared. The fluoride is known only as an <b>unstable</b> gaseous compound. Indium(I) oxide black powder is produced when indium(III) oxide decomposes upon heating to 700°C.|$|E
5|$|It is the {{combination}} of warm humid air from the Gulf and dry air from the deserts of the Southwest that produce deadly storms. These conditions create an <b>unstable</b> severe storm creating arena. Although tornadoes occur on every continent except Antarctica they are especially common in North America, specifically the United States.|$|E
5|$|Karamoko Alfa {{ruled the}} theocratic state until 1748, when his {{excessive}} devotions {{caused him to}} become mentally <b>unstable</b> and Sori was selected as de facto leader.|$|E
5|$|Keyser Creek has <b>unstable</b> banks due to {{abandoned}} mine impacts. Its banks are shallow and natural cobblestone banks in its lower reaches. However, the creek is channeled {{and has a}} steep bank further upstream.|$|E
5|$|Magnum XL-200 {{has been}} the target of false rumors since 1998 {{claiming}} the structure was sinking due to <b>unstable</b> ground. The rumors supposedly started as an April Fools Day joke in an Ohio newspaper, but quickly spread via the Internet. Cedar Point quickly denounced such rumors.|$|E
5|$|Manila is {{designated}} as the country's pioneer of medical tourism, expecting it to generate $1 billion in revenue annually. However, lack of progressive health system, inadequate infrastructure and the <b>unstable</b> political environment are seen as hindrances for its growth.|$|E
5|$|Mark Kinney – A mentally <b>unstable</b> teen who {{exhibits}} many of {{the signs}} of psychopathy. He was adopted by his aunt and uncle after his father {{was killed in a}} fire and his mother told him she never wanted to see him again.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum-98 is {{the most}} {{abundant}} isotope, comprising 24.14% of all molybdenum. Molybdenum-100 has a half-life of about 1019y and undergoes double beta decay into ruthenium-100. Molybdenum isotopes with mass numbers from 111 to 117 all have half-lives of approximately 150ns. All <b>unstable</b> isotopes of molybdenum decay into isotopes of niobium, technetium, and ruthenium.|$|E
5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally <b>unstable</b> when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally <b>unstable</b> when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
