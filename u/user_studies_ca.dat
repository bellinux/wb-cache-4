40|$|<b>User</b> <b>studies</b> play a {{vital role}} in data {{visualization}} research because they help measure the strengths and weaknesses of different visualization techniques quantitatively. In addition, they provide insight into what makes one technique more effective than another; and they are used to validate research contributions in the field of information visualization. For example, a new algorithm, visual encoding, or interaction technique is not considered a contribution unless it has been validated to be better than the state of the art and its competing alternatives or has been validated to be useful to intended users. However, conducting <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> is challenging, time consuming, and expensive. <b>User</b> <b>studies</b> generally requires careful experimental designs, iterative refinement, recruitment of study participants, careful management of participants during the run of the <b>studies,</b> accurately collecting <b>user</b> responses, and expertise in statistical analysis of study results. There are several variables that are taken into consideration which can impact <b>user</b> <b>study</b> outcome if not carefully managed. Hence the process of conducting <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> successfully can take several weeks to months. In this dissertation, we investigated how to design an online framework that can reduce the overhead involved in conducting controlled <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> involving web-based visualizations. Our main goal in this research was to lower the overhead of evaluating data visualizations quantitatively through <b>user</b> <b>studies.</b> To this end, we leveraged current research opportunities to provide a framework design that reduces the overhead involved in designing and running controlled <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> of data visualizations. Specifically, we explored the design and implementation of an open-source framework and an online service (VisUnit) that allows visualization designers to easily configure <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> for their web-based data visualizations, deploy <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> online, collect <b>user</b> responses, and analyze incoming results automatically. This allows evaluations to be done more easily, cheaply, and frequently to rapidly test hypotheses about visualization designs. We evaluated the effectiveness of our framework (VisUnit) by showing that it can be used to replicate 84 % of 101 controlled <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> published in IEEE Information Visualization conferences between 1995 and 2015. We evaluated the efficiency of VisUnit by showing that graduate students can use it to design sample <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> in less than an hour. Our contributions are two-fold: first, we contribute a flexible design and implementation that facilitates the creation of a wide range of <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> with limited effort; second, we provide an evaluation of our design that shows that it can be used to replicate a wide range of <b>user</b> <b>studies,</b> can be used to reduce the time evaluators spend on <b>user</b> <b>studies,</b> and can be used to support new research...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} the first to explore empirically the {{relationship}} between appraisal practice and <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> as well as the utilization of users and use as an appraisal factor. Both of these topics have been questioned in the archival community for several decades. This study investigated the current utilization of <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> in U. S. state archives and records management programs. It used the findings, along with participants¡¯ attitudes toward such practices, to consider the potential relationship between appraisal practice and <b>user</b> <b>studies.</b> A paucity of information on this research topic and on the target population necessitated three preliminary studies, conducted from 2006 through 2008, which facilitated the development of the survey questionnaire and three interview protocols. These tools were tested in a 2009 pretest study. In 2010 the full research study employed an online survey and in-person and phone interviews. Forty-seven eligible state archivists and records managers from thirty-three states participated, and interviewees involved twenty-eight participants from twenty-one states. This full study analyzed data at four levels (individual, group, program, and state), and it used SPSS software and NVivo 8 software for data analysis. According to the results of this <b>study,</b> the <b>user</b> <b>study</b> is the least frequently utilized user/use information source for appraisal practice, even though many participants consider users and use as an appraisal factor and collect user/use information from several different sources. Participants from only seven programs utilized results of <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> in their appraisal practice, and then only irregularly and unsystematically. Nevertheless, this study indicates the relationship between appraisal practice and <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> is likely to continue developing for two broad reasons. First, most participants have positive attitudes toward the feasibility and value of utilizing <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> in appraisal practice; participants who have done so proved the feasibility and value. Second, developing information technology helps conduct <b>user</b> <b>studies,</b> and results of this study show that if a program conducts a <b>user</b> <b>study,</b> its results will probably be utilized in appraisal practice. Findings of this study informed recommendations for further research, recommendations for archival education and training, and implications and recommendations for practitioners...|$|R

Methods: We used microscope-based fluorometry to measure cytoplasmicfreeCa 2 + concentration from fura- 2 –loaded single EndoC-BH 1 cellscultured on glass cover slips.

Results: EndoC-BH 1 cells secreted insulin in response to glucose ina dose-dependent manner, and the secretion was enhanced by GLP- 1 (glucagon-like peptide 1). Glucose, potassium chloride, carbachol, L-arginine,and tolbutamide increased cytoplasmic-free Ca 2 + concentration in theEndoC-BH 1 cells.
