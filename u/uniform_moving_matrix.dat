A standard method of lines approach is applied in this contribution. A partial differential equation system is discretized in space by second-order finite-difference schemes on uniform computational grids, and the time-variable is preserved as continuous. Initial value problems for systems of ordinary differential equations for pressure and velocity components are computed using the Galerkin-Runge-Kutta method of third order.

A new geometric approach for more complex coverage of a geographic region is proposed. Full and partial coverage of regions is considered.

The key idea of the method is a two-dimensional space application for maps of the satellite constellation and coverage requirements. The space dimensions are right ascension of ascending node and argument of latitude. Visibility requirements of each region can be presented as a polygon and satellite constellation as a <b>uniform</b> <b>moving</b> grid. At any time, at least one grid vertex must belong to the polygon. The optimal configuration of the satellite constellation corresponds to the maximum sparse grid.

40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} concerns design, modeling, {{and evaluation}} of portable parallel block matrix factorizations and certain numerical computations related to the Kronecker canonical form (KCF) of matrix pencils. Efficient parallel block algorithms for the LU, Cholesky, and QR factorizations, transportable over a range of shared memory multiprocessor architectures are presented. The algorithms are evaluated {{from the point of}} view of explicit versus implicit parallelization and dynamic versus static load balancing. Limitations from software overhead and sequential bottlenecks are identified and quantified for several different implementations on the IBM 3090 VF/ 600 J. We present a block column wrap-mapping approach for design of parallel block matrix factorization algorithms that are portable over and between shared memory multiprocessors and distributed memory multicomputers. The optimal block size and the parallel execution time are predicted by a performance model. By viewing an m Θ n matrix pencil A Γ *B as a point in 2 mn space, certain numerical computations relating to the KCF can be viewed as <b>moving</b> <b>matrix</b> pencils from manifold to manifold in the 2 mn space. We make use of the geometry of this space, to improve our knowledge of numerical algorithms and their failures.

Motion artefacts caused by respiration and bowel movements continue to be a challenge in the acquisition of high quality MR imaging of the intestine. T 1 -weighted images are especially sensitive to these artefacts. With this study, we will compare and evaluate new MR sequences in order to improve and create a standardised MRI-protocol in the {{diagnosis of}} IBD. One main focus of this study is a new gadolinium enhanced T 1 -weighted, 3 D fast spoiled GRE sequence with fat suppression, called LAVA (Liver-Acquisition-with-Volume-Acceleration). Originally created for MR liver imaging, this new sequence also promises to be an improvement in the MR bowel imagining and in the diagnosis of IBD. Six radiologists retrospectively analysed MR images created with a <b>uniform</b> <b>moving</b> bowel model, making a standardised comparison possible, and the MRI images of thirty-six patients with IBD. The used sequences were FIESTA/TrueFISP, T 2 -SSFSE/HASTE, T 2 -FRFSE, T 1 -FS-GRE and LAVA. This study provides strong evidence that FIESTA/TrueFISP and T 2 -SSFSE/HASTE are superior to the other sequences, but in direct comparison with T 1 -weighted sequences, LAVA is significantly better than T 1 -FS-GRE. In direct comparison with T 2 -weighted sequences, T 2 -SSFSE/HASTE is significantly superior to T 2 -FRFSE.

This kind of spectrometer theoretically requires that flying platform keeps <b>uniform</b> <b>moving</b> velocity and steady attitude in the imaging mode, {{as well as the}} imaging motion in each two neighboring interferograms is one array of pixels. The unsteadiness of platform would not only cause problems such as distortion, mixed pixels and lower signal-noise ratio on acquired spatial images, but also produce deviation and decadence of interferograms away from ideal ones, bringing the distortion of real spectra. The abnormal image motion model between satellite attitude and the data {{acquired by}} SMIFTS is built based on the theory that projection center of a sensor, an image point and an object on the ground are in the same line. This paper calculates the image motions between different frames, assuming that the pitch angle and yaw angle are same, And moreover, analyzes the effect of the attitude steadiness on the data quality of SMIFTS. The results show that, pitch angle bringing distortion of neighboring interferograms in along-orbit directions has most serious effect, the image gradient decrease obviouly and the discrepancy between interferogram and spectra is bigger, yaw angle bringing the relative rotation of neighboring interferograms has the less serious effect on images and spectra.
