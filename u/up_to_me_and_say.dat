500|$|... "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] {{was written}} by {{freelance}} writer Steve Pepoon and directed by Rich Moore. It was originally going to be named [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast {{to feel as if}} all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment ("thou shall not steal"), {{which is one of the}} Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that [...] "whenever people come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this , where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to keep his anonymity, Grohl planned to release the songs under the name Foo Fighters. It {{would be a very}} low-key release, with only 100 LP records being pressed after the {{sessions}} were finished. Grohl also went to a cassette duplication lab in Seattle and created 100 cassette copies of the session and started handing them to friends for feedback and [...] "I'd give tapes to everybody. Kids would come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> 'Nirvana was my favourite band' and I'd say 'well here, have this'". Eddie Vedder premiered two songs from the recording on January 8, 1995 during his Self-Pollution radio broadcast. The recordings quickly circulated amongst the music industry, which in turn created record label interest. A deal was eventually signed to Capitol Records, as president Gary Gersh was a personal friend of Grohl ever since he worked on Nirvana's label Geffen Records.|$|E
2500|$|June 12, 2009: Both teams played {{each other}} {{for the first time at}} the new Yankee Stadium. The game had several lead changes, {{including}} Mariano Rivera giving up the go ahead run to the Mets in the 8th. In the bottom of the 9th, after Derek Jeter stole 2nd base and Mark Teixeira was intentionally walked, the Mets new closer Francisco Rodríguez (K-Rod) paired off against Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod). In what seemed a routine pop with two outs, Mets 2nd baseman and three time gold glove award winner Luis Castillo dropped the ball. Teixeira wound up scoring the winning run all the way from first on the error to give the Yankees the 9-8 victory. It would prove to be the Yankees' 7th walk off game that season and the first statistical blown save for K-Rod as a Met. After the game, injured Yankees pitcher Brian Bruney criticized K-Rod and his animated behavior on the mound to reporters. [...] " [...] couldn't have happened to a better guy on the mound, either", said Bruney. [...] "He's got a tired act. ... He gets what he deserves, man. I just don't like watching the guy pitch. I think it's embarrassing." [...] Rodriguez responded, [...] "Instead of sending a message in the paper, next time when he sees me at Citi Field, come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> it. Don't be sending a message to the media. I don't even know who that guy is, somewhere in Double-A and not even pitching one full season." ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{number of}} laboring people are sauntering about our streets and taking their rest on this holiday--fellows {{who have no}} more stolen my pears than they have robbed the crown jewels out of the Tower--and I say I cannot help {{thinking}} in my own mind, [...] "Are you the rascal who got over my wall last night?" [...] Is the suspicion haunting my mind written on my countenance? I trust not.

Go be hanged, you and your jargonels!" [...] You rascal thief! it is not merely three-halfp'orth of sooty fruit you rob me of, it is my peace of mind--my artless innocence and trust in my fellow-creatures, my childlike belief that everything they say is true. How can I hold out the hand of friendship in this condition, when my first impression is, [...] "My good sir, I strongly suspect that you were up my pear-tree last night?" [...] It is a dreadful state of mind. The core is black; the death-stricken fruit drops on the bough, and a great worm is within--fattening, and feasting, and wriggling! WHO stole the pears? I say. Is it you, brother? Is it you, madam? Come! {{are you ready to}} answer--respondere parati et cantare pares? (O shame! shame!) ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{album was}} named after the final song, [...] "Crime of the Century", which the band members felt was the strongest song on the album. Shortly after his {{departure}} from Supertramp, Hodgson commented: [...] "I've had more people come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that that song touched them more deeply than any other. That song really came together when we were living together at Southcombe Farm, Thorncombe, and just eating, sleeping, and breathing the ideas for the album. The song just bounced between Rick and I for so many weeks before it finally took form." [...] For unknown reasons, in several interviews both before and since, Hodgson has attributed the song as being written solely by Davies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{narrative}} is called [...] "a surreal period comedic tale of canine reincarnation exploring {{the relationships between}} father and son and master and dog". Peter O'Toole said that the film's use of comedy to explore {{the relationship between a}} father and son was part of the attraction for him: [...] "All of us have had these difficult familial relationships and I think it's a film for all of us who understand the relationship between a father and son. It's been interesting watching how various members of the crew have been looking at the monitors during scenes, because they come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'I had the same thing with my father.'" ...|$|E

The principle of least surprise is not for you only. The principle of least surprise means principle of least my surprise. And it means the principle of least surprise after you learn Ruby very well. For example, I was a C++ programmer before I started designing Ruby. I programmed in C++ exclusively for two or three years. And after two years of C++ programming, it still surprises me.|$|E
