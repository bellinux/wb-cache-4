5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the episode, {{a unique}} type of {{flashback}} is shown: one on the island. In the aftermath of Oceanic Flight 815 crash's, Locke wakes <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> and notices that his toes wiggle, making him realize that he is no longer paralyzed. He stands up and is called over by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) to help with an injured person.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, {{guests at}} the new hotel watched the wreck and rescue efforts of the United States Life-Saving Service for the Norwegian bark Dictator. The ship's figurehead, which washed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> several days later, was erected as a {{monument}} to the victims and rescuers. It stood along the oceanfront for more than 50 years. In the 21st century, it inspired the pair of matching Norwegian Lady Monuments, sculpted by Ørnulf Bast and installed in Virginia Beach and Moss, Norway.|$|E
5|$|In about 1853 {{a further}} three {{settlers}} {{arrived on the}} American whaling barque Belle, captained by Ichabod Handy. As well as George Campbell (who died in 1856) and Jack Brian (who left the island in 1854), the third, Nathan Thompson, brought three women (called Botanga, Bogoroo, and a girl named Bogue) from the Gilbert Islands. When his first wife Botanga died he then married Bogue. Thompson was the first resident to build a substantial house in the 1860s from mainland cedar washed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> Most of the residents with island ancestors have blood relations or are connected by marriage to Thompson and his second wife Bogue.|$|E

5|$|The {{final chapter}} {{begins with the}} men's {{resolution}} to abandon the floundering dinghy they have occupied for thirty hours and to swim ashore. As they begin the long swim to the beach, Billie the oiler, the strongest of the four, swims ahead of the others; the captain advances towards the shore while still holding onto the boat, and the cook uses a surviving oar. The correspondent is trapped by a local current, but is eventually able to swim on. After three of the men safely reach the shore and are met {{by a group of}} rescuers, they find Billie dead, his body washed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Greek fleet {{under the}} Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to Samos to {{challenge}} {{the remnants of the}} Persian fleet. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> at the feet of Mount Mycale in Ionia. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of the Greek force, the Persians emerged from the camp but the Greek hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much of the Persian force. The ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burned them, crippling Xerxes' sea power and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet.|$|E
5|$|A boat draws <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> {{bearing the}} veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety}} of the fishermen. Although neither of them recognises her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be found in this place that brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ("").|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the Battle of Plataea, Herodotus tells us that rumour of the Allied victory reached the Allied navy, at that time off the coast of Mount Mycale in Ionia. Their morale boosted, the Allied marines fought and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Mycale that same day, destroying the remnants of the Persian fleet. As soon as the Peloponnesians had marched north of the isthmus, the Athenian fleet under Xanthippus had joined up {{with the rest of the}} Allied fleet. The fleet, now able to match the Persians, had first sailed to Samos, where the Persian fleet was based. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting, and instead drew their ships <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> under Mycale. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes, and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships.

25|$|On 26 July 1897, the Advance was {{anchored}} in Botany Bay {{at the entrance}} to Cooks River, when a fierce squall drove her onto Lady Robinsons Beach. An inquiry into the stranding found that the port chain had parted and the other anchor had dragged. The wreck was sold by the insurance companies and repurchased by the former owner. The vessel was described to have been carried away <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and left there high and dry by the receding tide. She was found so far away from water that it would be necessary to dig a channel especially for her to be launched by means of towing power.|$|E
5000|$|Dunkirk was {{the worst}} {{experience}} of my life ... I saw hundreds of people killed in front of me. Some had no clothes on and were shot and bombed as they swam out to boats.

50|$|When {{originally}} designed, the canal's two-mile long waterway had two outlets, one {{on either}} end, {{which would allow}} sedimentation to be flushed into the ocean. However, engineers decided not to build the eastern outlet, near Kapiolani Park and the Waikiki Natatorium, when they determined that the contamination from that end would end <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of Waikiki.|$|R

25|$|Parsons {{was also}} a painter. In 1959, Tony Smith {{designed}} her waterfront house-studio on the North Fork of {{the east end of}} Long Island, New York, perched on a cliff overlooking Long Island Sound, where Parsons worked on her art in her time off from the gallery. Her painting style changed in 1947, turning from small landscapes and portraits into a bold, subjective abstraction when she began to make constructions from bits of wood and other materials that washed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> near her home; most often her constructions reflected the area around her North Fork home, but sometimes the pieces reflected her travels to the Caribbean and abroad.|$|E
25|$|On 17 November 2002, the {{oil tanker}} Prestige split {{in half and}} sank in the Atlantic Ocean, after having had a huge leak in its tanks. A few days later, Man woke up to find his life ruined by an oil spill. Tons of oil had washed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> where he lived. Most of his sculptures were irremediably {{destroyed}} and the oil even reached his house. Man was absolutely devastated, his whole life work destroyed before his eyes, and the natural environment where he lived heavily polluted for years to come. A month later, he {{was found dead in}} his hut. He had circulatory and respiratory problems, but most local people believe that he died of melancholy and sadness {{at the sight of the}} complete and utter destruction of his life by the oil spill. The Camelle authorities organized and paid for his funeral, and hundreds of locals attended.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to survival, the early colonists {{were expected to}} make a profit for the owners of the Virginia Company. Although the settlers were disappointed that gold did not wash <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and gems did not grow in the trees, they realized there was great potential for wealth of other kinds in their new home. Early industries, such as glass manufacture, pitch and tar production for naval stores, and beer and wine making took advantage of natural resources and the land's fertility. From the outset settlers thought that the abundance of timber would be the primary leg of the economy, as Britain's forests had long been felled. The seemingly inexhaustible supply of cheap American timber was to be the primary enabler of England's (and then Britain's) rise to maritime (merchant and naval) supremacy. However, the settlers could not devote as much time as the Virginia Company would have liked to developing commodity products for export. They were too busy trying to survive.|$|E
5000|$|Ocean {{currents}} move sand {{along the}} coast in a natural process known as longshore drift.

50|$|The {{coastal area}} is {{situated}} {{to the east}} of the A1 road. It is sparsely populated and includes sandy beaches, sand dunes, rugged cliffs and isolated islands.

Coal fields are nearby and 'sea coal' is washed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches.</b>|$|R
25|$|As {{everything}} {{had been done to}} help the passengers, and when nothing else could be done to save them, Mr Russell and people from all over Kilkee took in survivors from the disaster for the night. The next morning the extent of the disaster became apparent with bodies and wreckage strewn across the whole beach. As the day wore on it became known that of the 216 aboard, 98 lost their lives and 118 were saved. All day, bodies washed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and in the end 54 bodies were recovered. Most of the deceased were buried in the nearby Kilfiera graveyard. To help the survivors, a subscription was held with businessmen from all over Ireland and England contributing to it. In the end over £300 was raised, all going to the survivors and to the next of kin of the dead. As Ireland {{was in the middle of}} a famine, many poor people looted the ship, with some going as far as stripping the clothes from the dead.|$|E
25|$|At daybreak, {{the signal}} was given from the fort {{and all three}} Portuguese forces {{assaulted}} the Dutch position. On the right flank, Vicente attacked along the coast. When the Dutch fired a cannon volley, almost all the Kaffirs {{and some of the}} Lascarins abandoned the fight and ran back. The rest of them continued the charge and captured the rampart with two cannons. The Dutch captain, Marte, was killed in this battle and his units withdrew towards the beach. Some of them were heading for the three launches that were tied <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> but the Portuguese reached them first and cast them adrift, preventing the Dutch from escaping. After receiving reinforcements, Dutch troops reorganized and counterattacked the rampart now held by Portuguese. Although the Portuguese held their position, they suffered many casualties including two of their captains and two ensigns. Gradually the Dutch gained the upper hand and Portuguese forces started to withdraw. The commander of Galle, Lourenço Ferreira de Brito, observed the situation from the fort and came to their aid with a detachment under Bartolomeu d’Eça. With fresh troops the Portuguese regained the rampart while Lourenço Ferreira retired back to the fort with the wounded.|$|E
25|$|The German cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{hastened to}} Samoa after Admiral von Spee {{learned of the}} occupation. He arrived off Apia on 14 September 1914, {{three days after the}} {{departure}} of the last of the Allied cruisers and transports. The approach of the German ships was observed and the New Zealanders promptly manned their defences while many civilians, fearing exchanges of gunfire, made for the hills. By this stage artillery has been set <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> but there was no exchange of gunfire. One historian, Ian McGibbon, wrote that this was likely due to von Spee's fears of damage to German property should he open fire. Instead, von Spee steamed off and landed a small party further down the coast and learned from a German resident there the apparent strength of the occupation. Patrols dispatched to the area later interned the German resident. According to the historian J. A. C. Gray, von Spee considered a landing by the forces under his control would only be of temporary advantage in an Allied-dominated sea and so the German ships then made for Tahiti, a French possession. Here, not having to be concerned with the welfare of the local population and their property, von Spee would direct the bombardment of Papeete. He then rejoined the rest of his fleet and headed for South America.|$|E
5000|$|Léonie Duquet is {{believed}} to have been killed by a military death squad under Astiz' command. As neither her nor Villaflor's bodies were found, some observers thought the women may have been among victims flown by plane and helicopter and thrown out while still alive over the ocean near Buenos Aires. In early 1978, unidentified bodies began to wash <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> south of Buenos Aires.|$|R

Contrary to some descriptions, the pilot's storylines contained no detailed accounts of the pilot characters' backgrounds. The pilot concludes with the ending theme song and credits.|$|R
5000|$|The pūtātara {{is a type}} of trumpet used by the Māori {{people of}} New Zealand. It is customarily made with a carved wooden {{mouthpiece}} and a bell made from New Zealand's small native conch shells (Charonia lampas rubicunda) or [...] triton shell (Charonia tritonis). Larger pūtātara were particularly prized as the triton shell was rarely found and only sometimes washed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> in <b>the</b> Far North.|$|R
500|$|The {{story is}} set in Amity, a [...] seaside resort town on Long Island, New York. One night, a massive great white shark kills a young tourist named Chrissie Watkins while she skinny dips in the open waters. After finding what remains of her body washed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> {{investigators}} realize she was attacked by a shark. Police chief Martin Brody orders Amity's beaches closed, but mayor Larry Vaughn and the town's selectmen overrule him out of fear for damage to summer tourism, the town's main industry. With the connivance of Harry Meadows, {{the editor of the}} local newspaper, they hush up the attack.|$|E
500|$|In September 1942 an {{aircraft}} flying from Britain to Gibraltar crashed off Cádiz. All aboard were killed, including Paymaster-Lieutenant James Hadden Turner – a courier carrying top secret documents – and a French agent. Turner's documents included {{a letter from}} General Mark Clark, the American Deputy Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, to General Noel Mason-MacFarlane, British Governor and Commander in Chief of Gibraltar, informing him that General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander, would arrive in Gibraltar {{on the eve of}} the invasion's [...] "target date" [...] of 4November. Turner's body washed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> near Tarifa and was recovered by the Spanish authorities. When the body was returned to the British, the letter was still on it, and technicians determined that the letter had not been opened. Other Allied intelligence sources established that the notebook carried by the French agent had been copied by the Germans, but they dismissed it as being disinformation. To British planners it showed that some material that was obtained by the Spanish was being passed to the Germans.|$|E
