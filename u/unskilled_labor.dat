5|$|Soon after {{establishing}} his Hartford factory, Colt set out {{to establish}} a factory in Europe and chose London. He organized a large display of his firearms at the Great Exhibition of 1851 at Hyde Park, London and ingratiated himself by presenting cased engraved Colt revolvers to such appropriate officials as Britain's Master General of the Ordnance. At one exhibit Colt disassembled ten guns and reassembled ten guns using different parts from different guns. As the world's leading proponent of mass production techniques, Colt went on to deliver a lecture on the subject to the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) in London. The membership rewarded his efforts by awarding him the Silver Telford Medal. With help from ICE secretary, Charles Manby, Colt established his London operation near Vauxhall Bridge on the Thames River and began production on January 1, 1853. On {{a tour of the}} factory, Charles Dickens was so impressed with the facilities that he recorded his favorable comments of Colt's revolvers in an 1852 edition of Household Words. The factory's machines mass-produced its parts that were completely interchangeable and could be put together on assembly lines using standardized patterns and gauges by <b>unskilled</b> <b>labor</b> as opposed to England's top gun makers making each part by hand. Colt's London factory remained in operation for only four years. Unwilling to alter his open-top single-action design for the solid frame double-action revolver that the British asked for; Colt scarcely sold 23,000 revolvers to the British Army and Navy. In 1856 he closed the London plant and had the machinery, tooling, and unfinished guns shipped to Hartford.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{economy of}} the early 19th century was {{characterized}} by labor shortages, as noted by numerous contemporary observers. The labor shortage was attributed to the cheapness of land and the high returns on agriculture.

Labor prices in the U.S. were typically between 30 and 50 percent higher than in Britain. Women factory workers were especially scarce.

The sinking of the RMS Titanic, followed by onset of World War I (which made the high seas a much more dangerous place due to the threat of submarine attack) provided the final impetus to stamp out the practice. In 1915, Andrew Furuseth and Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. pushed through the Seamen's Act of 1915 that made crimping a federal crime, and finally put an end to it.|$|E
50|$|Separated {{from the}} Anglo-Protestant {{establishment}} by blood, religion and economic circumstances, white ethnic identities retained {{a strong sense}} of group cohesion throughout the early 20th century. During this period, many white ethnics were relegated to menial or <b>unskilled</b> <b>laboring</b> occupations. Often, they were subject to discrimination and lampooned with ethnic stereotypes by the White Anglo Saxon Protestant majority culture. White ethnic groups (i.e. Italians, Irish, Russians, Poles, Spanish, Portuguese, Greeks, Hungarians, Slovaks, Croats among them) experienced ethnic discrimination and xenophobia by the majority culture. Often included alongside these European ethnic groups were Arabs, Jews, Caucasian peoples such as Armenians, and certain Middle Eastern Christians such as Assyrians and Lebanese Maronite Catholics, who were likewise marginalized. In contrast to the mainly Protestant Old Stock Americans, white ethnics tend to practice Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. These cultural and religious differences helped to retain and sharpen {{a strong sense of}} separateness from the dominant American culture.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} expansion in biofuels on the global economy, income distribution and poverty. It utilizes simulation results of two World Bank models: a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model integrated with biofuels, land-use, and climate change modules, and a global income distribution model that utilizes household survey data of 116 countries. The first model simulates the effects over time of large scale expansion of biofuels on resource allocation, output prices, commodity prices, factor prices, and household income of the different countries and regions in the world. The second model uses these results recursively to calculate the impact on global income distribution and poverty. The results from the CGE model indicate that large scale expansion of biofuels lead to higher world prices of sugar, corn, oilseeds, wheat, and other grains, which lead to higher food prices. The increase in food inflation is higher in developing countries than in developed countries. The expansion of biofuels results in higher wages of <b>unskilled</b> rural <b>labor</b> relative to wages of the other labor types which are skilled urban, skilled rural, and unskilled urban, especially in developing countries. These positive wage effects on <b>unskilled</b> rural <b>labor</b> trigger movement of <b>unskilled</b> urban <b>labor</b> towards rural and agriculture. This is because production of feedstock in developing countries is relatively intensive {{in the use of}} <b>unskilled</b> rural <b>labor.</b> The effects of large scale expansion of biofuels on poverty vary across regions. But overall there is a slight increase in global poverty. The increase largely comes from South Asia (particularly India) and Sub-Saharan Africa. Significant number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa show higher poverty with large scale expansion of biofuels. However, poverty declines in East Asia and Latin America regions. Overall, there is a slight increase in the GINI coefficient. There is a slight increase in the GINI coefficient in Sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia.

25|$|There are {{different}} assumptions as well. According to Richard L. Jensen, cyclical unemployment was a grave matter primarily until 1935. Between 1935 and 1941 structural unemployment became the bigger problem. Especially the unions successes in demanding higher wages pushed management into introducing new efficiency-oriented hiring standards. It ended inefficient labor such as child labor, casual unskilled work for subminimum wages, and sweatshop conditions. In {{the long term}} the shift to efficiency wages led to high productivity, high wages and a high standard of living. But it necessitated a well-educated, well-trained, hard-working labor force. It was not before war time brought full employment that the supply of <b>unskilled</b> <b>labor</b> (that caused structural unemployment) downsized.|$|E

Since the early 1990s, Mexican immigrants are no longer concentrated in California, the Southwest, and Illinois, but have been coming to new gateway states, including New York, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, and Washington, D.C., in increasing numbers. This phenomenon can be mainly attributed to poverty in Mexico, the growing demand for <b>unskilled</b> <b>labor</b> in the U.S., the existence of established family and community networks that allow migrants to arrive in the U.S. with people known to them.|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of factor shares {{has long been}} {{considered one of the}} “stylized facts ” of macroeconomics. However, the relationship between cross-country factor shares and economic development is dependent on how factor shares are measured. Most factor share studies acknowledge only two factors of production: total capital and total labor. The failure to acknowledge more than two factors yields misleading results. In {{the first part of the}} paper, I distinguish between reproducible and non-reproducible factors of production. I disentangle physical capital’s share from natural capital’s share and human capital’s share from <b>unskilled</b> <b>labor’s</b> share. Results reveal that non-reproducible factor shares decrease with the stage of economic development, and reproducible factor shares increase with the stage of economic development. This suggests that studies relying on the macroeconomic paradigm of constant factor shares should be revisited. Development accounting nearly always assumes the constancy of factor shares. In the second part of the paper, I perform the development accounting exercise but allow factor shares to vary and distinguish between reproducible and non-reproducible factors. My approach yields results that stand in stark contrast to those previously attained. The general consensus is that at least half of the cross-country variation i...|$|R

25|$|The main {{causes of}} human {{trafficking}} in Southeast Asia are universal {{factors such as}} poverty and globalization. According to Betz, poverty is not the root of human trafficking {{and that there are}} other factors such as the desire to have access to upward mobility and knowledge on the wealth that can be gained from working in urban cities, that ultimately attracts impoverished individuals to human traffickers. Betz claims the industrialization of the region in the mid 20th century led to a clear division between growing economies and stagnant ones. This industrialization of booming economies, like that of Thailand and Singapore created a draw for poor migrants seeking upward mobility and individuals wanting to leave war torn countries. These migrants were an untapped resource in growing economies that had already exhausted the cheap labor from within its borders. A high supply of migrant workers seeking employment and high demand from an economy seeking cheap labor creates a perfect combination for human traffickers to thrive. Still in the new millennium the market for forced labor is profitable; class-divisions and the economies' need for <b>unskilled</b> <b>labor</b> keep traffickers in the market.|$|E
