2500|$|But the {{proposal}} {{did not receive}} support to pass the Maryland legislature, in spite of assurances that contributions from taxpayers would be limited strictly to city and state loans. On February 27, 1974, Maryland's Governor Mandel {{pulled the plug on}} the idea. Orioles owner Jerold Hoffberger was blunt: [...] "I will bow to the will of the people. They have told <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want to tell us. First, they don't want a new park and second, they don't want a club." [...] Robert Irsay was willing to wait. [...] "It's not a matter of saying {{that there will be no}} stadium. It's a matter of getting the facts together so everybody is happy when they build the stadium. I'm a patient man. I think the people of Baltimore are going to see those new stadiums in New Orleans and Seattle opening in a year or two around the country, and they are going to realize they need a stadium ... for conventions and other things besides football." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, never mind," [...] said Mrs. Kenton. [...] "We {{can tell}} them to bring <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> like for dinner, and we can have it {{whenever}} we like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is better; {{if women}} will come fussing over <b>us</b> with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> don't understand--- You {{are the right}} sort; but for her---' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, that's {{the way of}} 'em. <b>They</b> grudges <b>us</b> {{everything}} <b>what</b> <b>they</b> don't give themselves," [...] said Dan, [...] "and {{little of}} that, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} thought they {{would have tried to}} find us first, so as to let <b>us</b> know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were going to do," [...] said Ralph.|$|R
6000|$|Peter Rabbit hopped up excitedly. [...] "You {{said that}} the largest animals in the world live in the sea, and you haven't told <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are," [...] he cried.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{the chief}} said. [...] "We {{go on with}} you there, {{and then come back}} here and meet the young men, who will tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have found out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Silence, profane! {{and take}} me away from this. Let us go down, and hide our stupidities among those sand-hills, and so forget the whole. What use {{standing}} here to be maddened by this tantalizing earth- spirit, who shows us such glorious things, and will not tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll go {{and have}} a look at it after dinner," [...] {{observed}} Ned; [...] "meanwhile, here are our comrades, let <b>us</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have to say about the proposal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If they can't do {{any better}} than that, we shan't have much to worry <b>us.</b> <b>What</b> do <b>they</b> take <b>us</b> for, I wonder? Farmers? Playing off a comic-supplement bluff like that on us!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let <b>us</b> see <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{have got}} here," [...] Francis said, while the {{merchant}} {{leaned against the}} table {{with an air of}} profound depression, paying no attention to what he was doing.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{some others}} were as honest," [...] said the rector, [...] "the {{problems}} of clergymen {{would be much}} easier. And {{it is precisely because}} people will not tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> feel that we are left in the dark and cannot help them. Of course, the language of St. John about the future is figurative." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'We {{have nothing}} to do with the Huguenots, one way or other,' the woman said. 'There are no Huguenots in this village, and it is nothing to <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do in other parts. Send off Jacques if you like, and perhaps it will be best; but I don't want any {{fighting}} or bloodshed here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, we {{were there}} {{an hour and a}} half ago, and I am glad to say these last occurrences have {{completely}} changed his opinion of the case. We left him going into the matter with Danvers, who is coming to dine with us this evening, and will tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> think as to fighting Gilliat.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] he went on, [...] "it {{seems to}} me odd that olives seven years old should {{be as good as}} that! Send for some dealers in olives, and let <b>us</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Oliver with a sigh, for he {{was thinking}} of Maqueda, [...] "but that's why they saved us, the vindictive beasts, to kill <b>us</b> for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are pleased to call high treason." ...|$|R
50|$|The colonial past of the places, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{took from}} <b>us</b> and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> left behind {{as well as}} the peoples protests and uprisings, the region {{witnesses}} and their heroes and victims are integrated into the narrative, by way of information as well as critiquing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, then,' {{replied the}} other, 'the good {{in this state}} of {{existence}} preponderates over the bad, let miscalled philosophers tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> will. If our affections be tried, our affections are our consolation and comfort; and memory, however sad, is the best and purest link between this world and a better. But come! I'll {{tell you a story}} of another kind.' ...|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding {{the regular}} {{supply of food}} which we {{obtained}} from Captain Bob and his friends, it was so small that we often felt most intolerably hungry. We could not blame them for not bringing us more, for we soon became aware {{that they had to}} pinch themselves in order to give <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> did; besides, they received nothing for their kindness but the daily bucket of bread.|$|E
60|$|When our {{passengers}} were released and given another meal (finger-bowls came first this time) they told <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> thought {{of us and}} the Board; and, like Vincent, we all marvelled how they had contrived to extract and secrete so much bitter poison and unrest out {{of the good life}} God gives us. They raged, they stormed, they palpitated, flushed and exhausted their poor, torn nerves, panted themselves into silence, and renewed the senseless, shameless attacks.|$|E
60|$|But {{although}} {{the notion of}} an absolute criterion is chimerical, there may be relative criteria, which increase the probability of truth. Common sense and science hold that there are. Let <b>us</b> see <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have to say.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{come to us}} in all {{peace and}} security," [...] said Mareschal-Wells; [...] "let <b>us</b> first hear <b>what</b> account <b>they</b> give <b>us</b> of this mysterious affair. If Miss Vere has {{sustained}} the slightest insult or injury from Earnscliff, I will be first to revenge her; but let <b>us</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I donno, sir. I canna be expecten to 't. 'Tis not me as {{should be}} looken to for that, sir. 'Tis them as is put ower me, and ower aw {{the rest of}} <b>us.</b> <b>What</b> do <b>they</b> tak upon themseln, sir, if not to do't?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We won't have nothin' to do {{with the}} ten-cent party," [...] the Oracle said, as soon as Winny was so far away that he could not hear. [...] "If the girls had come to us an' asked what we thought of it, then p'rhaps we'd gone in with 'em; but instead of that they fixed the thing up to suit themselves, an' then told <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> was going to do. Now they can have their party, and Win Curtis will be the only feller there." ...|$|E
60|$|This doctrine, therefore, of the righteousness of Christ being rightly preached, {{and truly}} believed, arraigneth and condemneth man's righteousness to hell; it casteth {{it out as}} Abraham cast out Ishmael. Blood, blood, the sound of blood, abaseth all the glory of it! When men have said all, and showed <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> can, they have no blood to present God's justice with; yet it is blood that maketh an atonement for the soul, and nothing but blood can wash away from us our sins (Lev 17:11; Rev 1:5; Heb 9).|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] exclaimed Mrs. Kate, {{when she}} heard of this interview, [...] "now you must grant me one more favor! Here is another pair of lovers who owe {{everything}} to our honey-moon and your wedding-tour. We ought to know them, for we made them what they are. So let us invite them here, and let them be married from this house. I do not believe Miss Raybold has a proper home of her own; and, in any case, {{the only way they}} can pay <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> owe us is to give us the pleasure of seeing them wedded here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They {{should have}} mauled us,' he said, 'instead of mewing at <b>us.</b> I wonder <b>what</b> <b>they</b> meant. I don't like it one little bit.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My recognizances?--Not in the least, my dear friend, {{were it not}} for our honor. It would {{scarcely}} be creditable for the Walrus to sail, however, {{leaving an}} unsettled account of her captain's behind <b>us.</b> <b>What</b> would <b>they</b> say at Stunin'tun--what would your own consort think of an act so unmanly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought maybe}} they'd make <b>us</b> do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> call police duty," [...] {{said the boy}} from Texas. [...] "One fellow told me {{that while he was}} in the {{training}} camp he overstepped the regulations and they made him peel potatoes until he was sick and tired of seeing them." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{they called}} his picture {{had been drawn}} at length so many times by the daubers of almost all nations, and still so unlike him, that I {{snatched}} up the pencil with disdain, being satisfied beforehand that I could make some small resemblance of him, though I must be content with a worse likeness. A sixth Pastoral, a Pharmaceutria, a single Orpheus, and some other features have been exactly taken. But those holiday authors writ for pleasure, and only showed <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could have done {{if they would have}} taken pains to perform the whole.|$|E
6000|$|I {{know it is}} said, {{that your}} {{kindness}} is only alienated on account of their resistance, and therefore, if the colonies surrender at discretion, all sort of regard, and even much indulgence, is meant towards them in future. But can those who are partisans for continuing a war to enforce such a surrender be responsible (after all that has passed) for such a future use of a power that is bound by no compacts and restrained by no terror? Will they tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> call indulgences? Do they not at this instant call the present war and all its horrors a lenient and merciful proceeding? ...|$|E
60|$|There were, however, {{two great}} {{differences}} in principle between the Greek and the Egyptian theories of policy. In Greece {{there was no}} soldier caste; every citizen was necessarily a soldier. And, again, while the Greeks rightly despised mechanical arts {{as much as the}} Egyptians, they did not make the fatal mistake of despising agricultural and pastoral life; but perfectly honoured both. These two conditions of truer thought raise them quite into the highest rank of wise manhood that has yet been reached; for all our great arts, and nearly all our great thoughts, have been borrowed or derived from them. Take away from <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have given; and I hardly can imagine how low the modern European would stand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, how you frightened me, Jinny!" [...] she cried. [...] "I {{thought it}} was the Dutch coming to murder <b>us</b> all, <b>What</b> have <b>they</b> done to Clarence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is," [...] Harry said. [...] "Thank God {{they have}} found us! Twenty to one they will get <b>us</b> out. <b>What</b> have <b>they</b> got with them, I wonder?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the rooftop}} climax, Bourne tells Paz, [...] "Look at <b>us.</b> Look at <b>what</b> <b>they</b> make you give", reiterating the dying words of The Professor (Clive Owen) in The Bourne Identity.|$|R
