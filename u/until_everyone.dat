40|$|After joining CEFTA in 1997, Romania {{established}} a relatively stable group of partner countries for its agri-food trade. Several factors {{contributed to the}} stability in time of this group, firstly the existence or establishment of preferential trade agreements, the geographical proximity, and last, but not least, the historical traditions. The exit from CEFTA and the accession to the EU {{of some of the}} partner countries, then of Romania itself, changed only temporarily the trade flows, <b>until</b> <b>everyone's</b> adaptation to the "new rules of the game". Among the new Member States of the EU (NMS- 13), the main trading partners for Romania were and are Hungary, Bulgaria and Poland.

25|$|Communion {{practices}} and frequency vary among congregations. A typical practice {{is to have}} small cups of juice and plates of broken bread distributed to the seated congregation. In other congregations, communicants may proceed to the altar to receive the elements, then return to their seats. A widely accepted practice is for all to receive and hold the elements <b>until</b> <b>everyone</b> is served, then consume the bread and cup in unison. Usually, music is performed and Scripture is read during the receiving of the elements.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} {{evening of the}} bombardment, Venizelos wrote a protest to the foreign admirals, which was signed by all the chieftains present at Akrotiri. He wrote that the rebels would keep their {{positions}} <b>until</b> <b>everyone</b> is killed from the shells of European warships, {{in order not to}} let the Turks remain in Crete. The letter was deliberately leaked to international newspapers, evoking emotional reactions in Greece and in Europe, where the idea of Christians, who wanted their freedom, being bombarded by Christian vessels, caused popular indignation. Throughout western Europe much popular sympathy for the cause of the Christians in Crete was manifested, and much popular applause was bestowed on the Greeks.|$|E
500|$|The {{fighting}} and pursuit of McCausland's Brigade endured for about [...] <b>until</b> <b>everyone</b> was so scattered that pursuit was useless. Many of the Confederates {{were afraid of}} retaliation for their acts in Chambersburg, {{and did not want}} to get caught with the money and items they took. This increased their desperation to flee Averell's men, and caused them to leave their loot behind. A considerable amount of money was recovered from the rebel camps.|$|E
5000|$|Springgun was an {{old school}} punk rock band from central Arkansas.

Up <b>until</b> then, <b>everyone</b> they met in the executive world outside their isolated and insulated realm was a Lord of EMI (the parent company that owned Capitol Records), a corporate chairman or a high-ranking executive.

500|$|In 1929, the 17-year-old Como met Roselle Belline at {{a picnic}} on Chartiers Creek that {{attracted}} many young people from the Canonsburg area. Como, who attended the cookout with another girl, did not spot Roselle <b>until</b> <b>everyone</b> was around the campfire singing and the gathering was coming to a close. When it came Como's turn to sing, he chose [...] "More Than You Know", with his eyes on Roselle for the entire song. The teenage sweethearts were married July 31, 1933. They raised three children, Ronnie, David, and Terri, with traditional, non-show-business values. Because Perry Como believed his professional life and his personal life should be kept separate, he declined repeated interview requests from Edward R. Murrow's Person to Person.|$|E
500|$|Victor apologizes to Emily {{for lying}} to her, {{and the two}} reconcile.

He also overhears that, in order to validate Victor and Emily's marriage, Victor must repeat his vows in the Land of the Living and willingly drink the Wine of Ages, a poison, thus joining her in death. Fretting about having lost Victoria to another man, Victor agrees to die for Emily. All of the dead go [...] "upstairs" [...] to the Land of the Living to perform the wedding ceremony for Victor and Emily. Upon their arrival, the town erupts into a temporary panic <b>until</b> <b>everyone</b> recognizes their loved ones from the dead, {{and they have a}} joyous reunion.|$|E
500|$|The {{first thing}} Fuse and his art team {{had to do}} was {{figuring}} out how to create 3D models that preserve {{the look and feel of}} the previous games' 2D sprites, even when viewed in stereoscopic 3D. Some of the artists on the team created a concept trailer for how the game's visuals would work, featuring a 3D model of Phoenix. Looking back at it, Fuse called the model [...] "cringe-worthy", but it was able to be used as a base. Everyone on the development team gave feedback on the model, and it was continuously refined <b>until</b> <b>everyone</b> was satisfied with its look; this process alone took six months. The art team also wanted to preserve the [...] "lively" [...] style of animation used in the 2D sprites. To do this, they used [...] "various tricks" [...] such as using different character models for different angles. They also took advantage of the increased capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS hardware, and added camera movements and connecting animations to give the character animation further fluidity.|$|E

500|$|The second {{episode of}} the series {{was the first to}} feature {{predominantly}} original writing, as the [...] "Pilot" [...] contained many jokes from the British series pilot. During one of Michael's impersonations, a racial expletive spoken by Michael had to be censored by the producers for NBC. Daniels was terrified that the scene would leak unedited, so he personally oversaw the censoring of the master copy. The scene where Pam rests her head on Jim's shoulder after Dwight has stolen his sale and Jim smiles and says [...] "not a bad day after all" [...] came about when Greg Daniels spoke to the writers about wanting to have small, happy interactions between Jim and Pam and mentioned the head-on-shoulder idea, which B. J. Novak immediately wrote into his script. Paul Lieberstein did not want to appear in the episode and did so assuming it would be a one-time event, but Kevin Reilly was impressed by his work and said the show should use him more, leading to the expansion of Paul's work as Toby Flenderson. Two scenes that were cut involved Michael Scott responding to Mr. Brown's [...] "HERO" [...] acronym by creating one that sounded good <b>until</b> <b>everyone</b> noticed the words created the acronym of [...] "INCEST", and Michael responded to Mr. Brown's nixing of that idea by pointing out the links between incest and racism in some states, while another had Jim replacing Dwight's [...] "Asian" [...] headband with [...] "Dwight" [...] and then having the other co-workers complain to a clueless Dwight about how annoying his behavior was.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Quarterback", Rachel is devastated {{with the}} loss of Finn. Michele, who in real life was dating Cory Monteith, had asked to {{postpone}} this episode <b>until</b> <b>everyone</b> was ready. Rachel doesn't appear in this episode until the very end where she states, [...] "Before Finn, I used to sing alone, {{this was one of the}} songs we would sing when we drove around together." [...] She sings [...] "Make You Feel My Love". Later in the episode, she states that Finn was her person and that they were always going to be together. Later in the season, it is revealed that she got a tattoo of Finn's name (despite telling Kurt that she chickened out when they went to the tattoo shop). Rachel hires Santana to be her publicist, which leads her to take on a charitable cause with a local rescue kennel. She performs with Mercedes and Santana on stage for the benefit, Broadway Bitches, but the publicity stunt goes wrong when the dogs pull her down and drag her for several blocks. Despite this, Santana reassures her and they discuss the next step in their campaign. Rachel lands the lead on the Broadway show, Funny Girl. Santana offers to be Rachel's understudy when Rachel is stuck in Los Angeles for a television show audition. Before the opening, she suffers from a bout of self-doubt, but performs after Santana gives her a pep talk. Lee Paulblatt, a Fox Television executive, sees Rachel perform, and is so impressed, he informs her wants to cast her in an upcoming, untitled television pilot. He has her meet with the famed screenwriter, Mary Halloran, who will be creating the script. After the first meeting, Rachel is confused by Mary's ideas and idiosyncratic behavior. Rachel has the group review Mary's script, and everyone agrees it is terrible (except Brittany). Rachel meets with Mary and tells her that the lead character does not sound like her. Mary points out that television viewers want anti-heroes, but Rachel responds by singing, and Mary, uncharacteristically, is moved and made happy by the performance. She agrees to redo the script, but warns Rachel that the network will never make a pilot from it. Eventually, the network loves the script and calls Rachel, and she moves to LA to start shooting her pilot.|$|E

2500|$|During a Christmas Eve {{party in}} 1894, an oil lamp started {{a fire in}} a crowded {{community}} hall {{in the small town}} of Silver Lake, Oregon. [...] Forty-three people were killed in the blaze, and many more were badly injured. Daly drove his buggy from Lakeview to Silver Lake, a distance of ninety-five miles, over bad, snow-covered roads to help victims of the tragedy. [...] It took twenty-four hours of continuous travel for Daly to reach Silver Lake. Despite the long journey, he began treating burn victims as soon as he arrived, and continued without rest <b>until</b> <b>everyone</b> had been seen.

2500|$|Writing for {{the record}} began in September 2003, soon after Isis had {{relocated}} from Boston to Los Angeles. According to guitarist Mike Gallagher, “we started working on ideas for songs and sounds as individuals, in pairs or as a whole group until {{we were able to}} shape the ideas into songs that we were all happy with and could stand behind”. Whilst some tracks originated from [...] "little jams" [...] the band would do at sound check, the majority of the album was created in time dedicated to writing new material. Gallagher adds that “usically speaking, Panopticon came out a couple of ideas that had been kicking around in our heads for some time, but the bulk of it was composed after we decided {{that it was time to}} do a new record. The writing process consisted mostly of an individual starting the core of an idea for a song at home then either pairing off with someone else or bringing it to everyone where it was worked on and refined <b>until</b> <b>everyone</b> was satisfied”. According to Jeff Caxide, this process was significantly different from that of previous Isis albums, as “everyone wrote a lot on this record. There is not one song that could be credited to one person”.|$|E

However, the novel was also controversial right from the start, with conservative readers as well as feminists criticizing Allen for the heroine he had invented.
