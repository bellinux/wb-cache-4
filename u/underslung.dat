5|$|Vulcan B.1 XA894 flew {{with five}} Olympus engines, the {{standard}} four Mk.101s, plus a reheated Olympus 320 {{destined for the}} BAC TSR-2 in an <b>underslung</b> nacelle. This aircraft was destroyed in a ground fire at Filton on 3 December 1962.|$|E
5|$|The RAF ordered 22 Merlin HC3 for {{transport}} missions, {{the first of}} which entered service in January 2001 with No. 28 Squadron RAF based at RAF Benson. The type is equipped with extended-range fuel tanks and is capable of air-to-air refuelling. The Merlin is frequently utilised for troop transport duties and for the transport of bulky objects, either internally or <b>underslung,</b> including vehicles and artillery. The Merlin Depth Maintenance Facility at RNAS Culdrose performed most tasks upon the Merlin HC3.|$|E
5|$|Vulcan B.1 XA903, {{surplus to}} Blue Steel trials, was {{converted}} to a similar layout to XA894 to flight test the Olympus 593 Concorde installation. The first flight was on 1 October 1966 and testing continued through to June 1971. In April 1973, XA903 flew with an <b>underslung</b> Rolls-Royce RB.199 turbofan destined for the Panavia Tornado. The RB.199 engine included both the reheat and thrust reverser functions. XA903 was the last B.1 to fly, being retired in February 1979.|$|E
5|$|Westland also {{manufactured}} SAR {{versions of}} the Sea King for the Royal Norwegian Air Force, the German Navy and the Belgian Air Force. On SAR variants, the cabin was enlarged by a stretch of the fuselage behind the door; another key feature, used for additional flotation in the unusual event of a water landing, inflatable buoyancy bags were housed inside the aircraft's sponsons. Upgrades and changes made to SAR Sea Kings include the addition of radar warning receivers, a cargo hook for the <b>underslung</b> carriage of goods, and the redesigning of the cockpit for compatibility with night vision goggles.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{equipment}} included {{front and}} rear end rotating NATO tow hooks, lugs for suspended or supported recovery, helicopter lift points, and an infra-red reflective paint finish. The vehicle can be transported by C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, or <b>underslung</b> by CH-47 Chinook helicopter.|$|E
25|$|Production of cars {{restarted}} in 1947 {{with the}} 2-Litre, using the 1991 cc engine from the 16. The 2-Litre used {{an updated version}} of the pre-war, <b>underslung</b> chassis, fitted with the AC straight-six engine and traditional ash-framed and aluminium-panelled coachwork, available in saloon or convertible versions.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, de Dietrich debuted the Torpilleur (Torpedo) racer, which {{featured}} a four-cylinder engine and independent suspension in front, for the Paris-Amsterdam Trial; Gaudry wrecked en route, but still placed third. The response was substantial, exceeding one million gold francs. The 1899 torpilleur was less successful, despite <b>underslung</b> chassis, a rear-mounted monobloc four, and twin carburettors; poor preparation left {{none of the}} works teams able to complete the Tour de France.|$|E
25|$|The Cessna 208 is a high-wing braced cabin {{monoplane}} {{powered by}} a single Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop in tractor configuration. It has a fixed tricycle landing gear but can also be fitted with floats or skis. The cabin has room for nine passengers and two crew when used as a passenger aircraft with four doors: one for each crew member, an airstair door {{on the right side}} of the cabin and a cargo door on the left. The aircraft can be optionally fitted with an <b>underslung</b> cargo pod.|$|E
25|$|The Meteor F.1 was {{powered by}} two Rolls-Royce Welland {{turbojet}} engines, Britain's first production jet engines, which were built under license from Whittle's designs. The Meteor embodied {{the advent of}} practical jet propulsion; in the type's service life, both military and civil aviation manufacturers would rapidly integrate turbine engines into their designs, favouring its advantages such as smoother running and greater power output. The Meteor's engines were considerably more practical {{than those of the}} German Me 262, having both a longer service life and being more efficient; unlike the Me 262, the engines were embedded into the wing in nacelles between the front and rear spars rather than <b>underslung.</b>|$|E
25|$|The UH-1H's dynamic {{components}} include the engine, transmission, rotor mast, main rotor blades, tail rotor driveshaft, and the 42-degree and 90-degree gearboxes. The transmission is of a planetary type {{and reduces the}} engine's output to 324 rpm at the main rotor. The two-bladed, semi-rigid rotor design, with pre-coned and <b>underslung</b> blades, is a development of early Bell model designs, such as the Bell 47 with which it shares common design features, including a dampened stabilizer bar. The two-bladed system reduces storage space required for the aircraft, but {{at a cost of}} higher vibration levels. The two-bladed design is also responsible for the characteristic 'Huey thump' when the aircraft is in flight, which is particularly evident during descent and in turning flight. The tail rotor is driven from the main transmission, via the two directional gearboxes which provide a tail rotor speed approximately six times that of the main rotor to increase tail rotor effectiveness.|$|E
500|$|The dwarf and pygmy {{sperm whales}} {{resemble}} sperm whales, but are far smaller. They are dark gray, dorsally, while ventrally they are lighter. They have blunt, squarish heads with [...] narrow, <b>underslung</b> jaws; the flippers are set far forward, {{close to the}} head and their dorsal fins are set far back down the body.|$|E
500|$|The Fairy Queen {{was built}} by Kitson, Thompson and Hewitson at Leeds in England in 1855. [...] The {{coal-fired}} engine is powered by two outside cylinders measuring , and has a power output of , producing a maximum speed of [...] [...] It carries [...] of water in an <b>underslung</b> water tank. [...] The locomotive weighs , and the coal tender [...] [...] Built for the [...] Indian gauge, it has a 2-2-2 wheel arrangement, developed by Robert Stephenson and Company in 1833, with a driving wheel measuring [...] in diameter.|$|E
500|$|The F-16 has a cropped-delta wing {{incorporating}} wing-fuselage blending and forebody vortex-control strakes; a fixed-geometry, <b>underslung</b> {{air intake}} (with splitter plate) {{to the single}} turbofan jet engine; a conventional tri-plane empennage arrangement with all-moving horizontal [...] "stabilator" [...] tailplanes; a pair of ventral fins beneath the fuselage aft of the wing's trailing edge; and a tricycle landing gear configuration with the aft-retracting, steerable nose gear deploying a short distance behind the inlet lip. There is a boom-style aerial refueling receptacle located behind the single-piece [...] "bubble" [...] canopy of the cockpit. Split-flap speedbrakes are located at the aft end of the wing-body fairing, and a tailhook is mounted underneath the fuselage. A fairing beneath the rudder often houses ECM equipment or a drag chute. Later F-16 models feature a long dorsal fairing along the fuselage's [...] "spine", housing additional equipment or fuel.|$|E
500|$|The breed {{standard}} defines the Finnhorse as a multi-purpose horse of average height, and sturdy conformation. The ideal Finnhorse is easy-to-handle, versatile, and combines strength, agility, speed and endurance. Finnhorses are lively, {{with both a}} reliable and alert temperament. The {{breed standard}} encourages a horse that is [...] "honest and sincere"; eager to cooperate with humans, obedient, and willing to work. They are hardy with good endurance, robust health, and are generally long-lived. The breed standard describes {{the head of a}} Finnhorse as dry and the profile straight, not long or convex, with well-spaced, short ears. The neck should be well-shaped and not <b>underslung</b> or ewe-necked; the body should be on the long side, but rounded and proportionate; and the croup should neither be level nor with a too-high connection to the tail. Finnhorses are strongly muscled, with good bone, sturdy [...] "dry" [...] legs, and strong hooves.|$|E
500|$|The sperm whale's {{lower jaw}} is very narrow and <b>underslung.</b> The sperm whale has 18 to 26 teeth {{on each side}} of its lower jaw which fit into sockets in the upper jaw. The teeth are {{cone-shaped}} and weigh up to [...] each. The teeth are functional, but {{do not appear to be}} necessary for capturing or eating squid, as well-fed animals have been found without teeth or even with deformed jaws. One hypothesis is that the teeth are used in aggression between males. Mature males often show scars which seem to be caused by the teeth. Rudimentary teeth are also present in the upper jaw, but these rarely emerge into the mouth. Analyzing the teeth is the preferred method for determining a whale's age. [...] Like the age-rings in a tree, the teeth build distinct layers of cementum and dentine as they grow.|$|E
500|$|With its elongated, eel-like {{body and}} strange appearance, the frilled shark {{has long been}} likened to the mythical sea serpent. The head is broad and {{flattened}} with a short, rounded snout. The nostrils are vertical slits, separated into incurrent and excurrent openings by a leading flap of skin. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval and lack nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The very long jaws are positioned terminally (at {{the end of the}} snout), as opposed to the <b>underslung</b> jaws of most sharks. The corners of the mouth are devoid of furrows or folds. The tooth rows are rather widely spaced, numbering 19–28 in the upper jaw and 21–29 in the lower jaw. The teeth number around 300 in all; each tooth is small, with three slender, needle-like cusps alternating with two cusplets. There are six pairs of long gill slits with a [...] "frilly" [...] appearance created by the extended tips of the gill filaments, giving this shark its name. The first pair of gill slits meet across the throat, forming a [...] "collar".|$|E
2500|$|... 1910 Mercer Raceabout — {{regarded}} as one of the first sports cars, the Raceabout expressed the exuberance of the driving public, as did the similarly conceived American <b>Underslung</b> and Hispano-Suiza Alphonso.|$|E
2500|$|Berliner-Joyce {{had been}} formed in 1929, and {{had won a}} {{contract}} with the United States Army for the Berliner-Joyce P-16 aircraft. [...] At the same time, they submitted a similar design to the Navy, modified to meet the differing requirements, which included a metal-skinned semi-monocoque fuselage, shoulder-mounted upper wings and a lower wing <b>underslung</b> on cabane-type struts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{winding drum}} was either mounted {{horizontally}} (below the boiler), vertically (to one side), or even concentrically, {{so that it}} encircled the boiler. [...] The majority were <b>underslung</b> (horizontal), however, and necessitated {{the use of an}} extra-long boiler to allow enough space for the drum to fit between the front and back wheels. [...] These designs were the largest and longest traction engines to be built.|$|E
2500|$|The Romans, {{both men}} and women, wore cothurns, or sandals with {{platform}} heels; [...] these were intended to lift the wearers above mud and garbage in the streets. [...] Geta, {{which are based on}} a similar concept, are still used in Japan today. American cowboy boots, first developed in the 19th century and still popular today {{in some parts of the}} United States, have high <b>underslung</b> heels to keep a rider's foot from sliding through the stirrup. High-heeled platform shoes were a widely popular form of men's footwear during the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{upper wing}} was {{well above the}} {{fuselage}}, braced to it by two pairs of V-form struts on either side; two single struts from the same points on the upper fuselage braced each lower wing. [...] The pilot sat below the wing leading edge and the observer, equipped with a Lewis gun, sat well aft. [...] The split-axle undercarriage allowed torpedo dropping from under the aircraft and was fitted with wheel brakes as its shipborne role required, together with an arrestor hook and tailwheel. [...] The Buzzard's <b>underslung</b> radiator was positioned between the forward undercarriage legs.|$|E
2500|$|The ANT-44 was {{designed}} as a long-range maritime reconnaissance/bomber flying boat. Construction of the first two prototype began in 1934. [...] The initial design employed [...] an all-metal construction with a shoulder-mounted gull wing. The ANT-44 incorporated four 604kW (810hp) Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major 14Kdrs M-85 radial engines as well as <b>underslung</b> stabilizing floats. [...] After a month of factory trials, in December 1937 designers changed the Mistral Major radial engines for the higher rated and more powerful Tumansky M-87 627kW (840hp) engines. In 1938, they further modified the prototype to be amphibious, and the aircraft was refitted with updated 709kW (950hp) M-87A engines.|$|E
2500|$|The Pucará was {{designed}} for operations from short, rough airstrips. The retractable tricycle landing gear, with a single nosewheel and twin mainwheels retracting into the engine nacelles, is fitted with low pressure tyres to suit operations on rough ground, while the undercarriage legs are tall to give good clearance for <b>underslung</b> weapons loads. Three JATO rockets can be fitted under the fuselage to allow extra short takeoffs. Fuel is fed from two fuselage tanks of combined capacity of [...] and two self-sealing tanks of [...] in the wings. The undercarriage, flaps and brakes are operated hydraulically, with no pneumatic systems.|$|E
2500|$|Airbus Helicopters has {{promoted}} the airframe's various configurations as possessing [...] "unique adaptability" [...] for various missions, including utility work, commercial transportation, and training roles. Equipment {{for the law}} enforcement role include external loudspeakers, rappelling system, search lights with laser pointers, left or right-mounted hoists, and electro-optical sensors. For offshore oil & gas operations, the rotorcraft can be fitted with weather/search radars, emergency floatation aids (including an automated external life raft), energy-absorbent seating, class-D certified external hoists, and crash-resistant fuel cells. An external hook can be installed to carry <b>underslung</b> loads of up to 272kg for cargo missions. In a training capacity, features such a light aircraft recording system (for post-flight analysis), intuitive human-machine interface, specific training modules, and a one-engine inoperative training mode, and full ground simulators, may be selected.|$|E
2500|$|Artillery had {{to adopt}} new tactics. Almost all guns {{deployed}} in single gun sections within a company or platoon base. The sections were commanded {{by one of}} the battery's junior officers, warrant officers or sergeants. Sections had about 10 men and did their own technical fire control. They were moved <b>underslung</b> by Wessex or Belvedere helicopters as necessary to deal with incursions or support operations. [...] Forward observers were in short supply, but it seems that they always accompanied normal infantry Claret operations and occasionally special forces ones. However, artillery observers rarely accompanied patrols inside Sabah and Sarawak unless they were in pursuit of a known incursion and guns were in range. Observation parties were almost always led by an officer but only two or three men strong.|$|E
2500|$|Mk.320:The {{performance}} specification for the BAC TSR-2 was issued in 1962. It {{was to be}} powered by two BSEL Olympus Mk 320 (BOl.22R) engines each rated at [...] dry and [...] with reheat at take-off. The engine, which was re-stressed for supersonic flight at sea level, and over Mach 2.0 at altitude, and featured much use of high-temperature alloys such as titanium and Nimonic, was a cutting edge derivative of the Olympus Mk 301 with a Solar-type afterburner. The engine first ran in March 1961, soon achieving , and was test flown in February 1962 in an <b>underslung</b> nacelle {{in the belly of}} Vulcan B1 XA894 and was demonstrated at the Farnborough Air Show in September. In December 1962 during a full power ground run at Filton, the LP shaft failed. The liberated turbine disc ruptured fuel tanks and the subsequent fire completely destroyed the Vulcan.|$|E
2500|$|SCOA-P wheels were {{developed}} in the late 1940s by the Steel Company of Australia Ltd (the P in the acronym standing for F. C. Paynter, who patented the design) in response to Victorian Railways experiencing fatigue problems with conventional spoked wheels. Stronger Boxpok type 'B' wheels had been installed {{on a number of}} VR locomotive classes in the late 1940s, but they had the disadvantage of being relatively heavy and also restricted maintenance access to axleboxes, <b>underslung</b> springs, and in some cases boiler washout plugs. Boxpok wheels were proposed for the forthcoming Victorian Railways R class 4-6-4, which had a relatively heavy [...] axle load, but it had been discovered that the use of a Boxpok wheel would make coupling rod pin removal difficult. The SCOA-P wheel was developed to allow the strength of the Boxpok design but also provide the maintenance access of a conventional spoked wheel.|$|E
2500|$|Confronted {{with the}} same problem, the United States Air Force (USAF) also {{attempted}} to extend the operational life of its strategic bombers by developing a stand off missile, the AGM-28 Hound Dog. The first production model was delivered to the Strategic Air Command (SAC) in December 1959. It carried a [...] W28 warhead, and had a range of [...] at high level and [...] at low level. Its circular error probable (CEP) of over [...] at full range was considered acceptable for a warhead of this size. A Boeing B-52 Stratofortress could carry two; but but the <b>underslung</b> Pratt & Whitney J52 engine precluded its carriage by bombers with less underwing clearance. It entered service in large numbers, with 593 in service by 1963. Numbers declined thereafter to 308 in 1976, but it remained in service until 1977, when it {{was replaced by the}} AGM-69 SRAM. Despite its being superior in performance to Blue Steel, the British showed little interest in Hound Dog. It could not be carried by the Handley Page Victor, and there were doubts as to whether even the Avro Vulcan had sufficient ground clearance.|$|E
50|$|In 1912 {{all of its}} models {{featured}} the distinctive <b>underslung</b> chassis and the cars were officially named American <b>Underslung.</b> However, the new company was still over-extended and inefficient. The relatively small production of its numerous models was divided among three factories.|$|E
