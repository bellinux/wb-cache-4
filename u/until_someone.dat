5|$|Huger, {{worried about}} clashing with Union forces while marching towards Malvern Hill, had {{also failed to}} manage his {{division}} effectively. He deployed two of his brigades, commanded by Brig. Gens. Lewis Armistead and Ambrose Wright, to perform a flanking maneuver around any Federals they found, to avoid the Union threat. Longstreet eventually notified Huger {{that he would be}} unobstructed by Federal forces if he marched to Malvern Hill. Huger, however, remained in place <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> from Lee's headquarters came to guide them to the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim find their living styles are {{increasingly}} clashing. Jim is slovenly, leaving dirty dishes {{to soak in}} the sink <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> else washes them, while Darryl is so fastidious about his possessions that he puts labels with his name on all of them, even a bag of flour. When Darryl takes issue with Jim using his labeled coffee mug, the two begin bickering. Eventually the two come to understand each other's habits better, and relieve tension by playing a video game together.|$|E
5|$|The group became {{lost and}} confused. After {{two more days}} without food, Patrick Dolan {{proposed}} {{that one of them}} should volunteer to die in order to feed the others. Some suggested a duel, while another account describes an attempt to create a lottery to choose a member to sacrifice. Eddy suggested that they keep moving <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> simply fell, but a blizzard forced the group to halt. Antonio the animal handler was the first to die; Franklin Graves was the next casualty.|$|E

5000|$|Reflecting on {{the song}} [...] "Twenty-One Guns", Good Riddance singer Russ Rankin {{said it was}} [...] "a song {{about the plight of}} a soldier risking his life in some remote outpost for a cause he isn't privy to. The irony that we flippantly waste so much human life but wait <b>until</b> <b>someone's</b> death to bestow all of this honor and {{ceremony}} upon them. Musically a very angry song, very Born Against sounding to me now." [...] "Class War 2000" [...] was influenced musically by T.S.O.L. and lyrically by The Dils' 1977 song [...] "Class War", after which it was titled.|$|R
50|$|Bloody {{knuckles}} {{is a game}} {{in which}} each player makes a fist with the thumb wrapped around the other fingers. Then each fist punches the others fist. Players who flinch are out of the game. Whoever lasts the longest before quitting wins the game. The game is played <b>until</b> <b>someone's</b> knuckles are bleeding or suddenly they quit due to excessive pain. Variations include simultaneous or alternate punching, and games in which the strike is the loser's punishment/winner's privilege. In the first two ways of playing the game, violence, though essentially consensual, is inherent, not a risk. Almost all ways of playing are dangerous, carrying the risk of injury, scarring, and damage to one's bones and hand.|$|R
5|$|The {{staff had}} {{problems}} composing an opening {{theme for the}} series <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> provided some music by Ling Tosite Sigure, who was engaged to compose the opening theme. Egoist, who composed the ending theme, had debuted on Noitamina with Guilty Crown. Shiotani said they asked Egoist to record three versions of the ending theme so they could alternate them to match the episode's ending. Across the series, time limits resulted in the ending songs being removed or replaced with instrumental versions to avoid cutting scenes from the episode. When there were concerns from the producers of the songs, Tomohiro and Shiotani discussed this with them.|$|E
5|$|Sora, {{along with}} his allies, both possess a Hit Point (HP) meter and a Magic Point (MP) meter, which {{increase}} as they gain experience and level up. The MP meter is divided into various sections that are used up whenever that character performs magic, with more powerful magic using more MP. MP can be replenished by performing melee attacks or using items. The HP meter determines the character's health, reducing whenever a character takes damage, although it can be replenished by using healing items or spells. If one of Sora's allies runs out of health, they will be knocked out temporarily <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> heals them. However, if Sora loses all of his health, the game ends and the player must resume play {{from the beginning of}} an area or boss. Defeating enemies causes various orbs to fall; green orbs which replenish health, blue orbs which restore MP, and yellow orbs which represent Munny, the game's currency, which can be used to purchase new items.|$|E

25|$|The Honeymooners {{originated}} from a sketch Gleason was developing with his show's writers. He {{said he had}} an idea he wanted to enlarge: a skit with a smart, quiet wife and her very vocal husband. He went on to describe that, while the couple had their fights, underneath it all they loved each other. Titles for the sketch were tossed around <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> came up with The Honeymooners.|$|E
25|$|The {{flashback}} arrestor (not {{to be confused}} with a check valve) prevents shock waves from downstream coming back up the hoses and entering the cylinder, possibly rupturing it, as there are quantities of fuel/oxygen mixtures inside parts of the equipment (specifically within the mixer and blowpipe/nozzle) that may explode if the equipment is incorrectly shut down, and acetylene decomposes at excessive pressures or temperatures. In case the pressure wave has created a leak downstream of the {{flashback arrestor}}, it will remain switched off <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> resets it.|$|E
25|$|The {{winner of}} the Qualifying Round played the day's {{returning}} champion in the renamed Championship Round, which kept the same line/position form of scoring. However, {{instead of being a}} race against time, the Championship Round was a race to achieve a score of one hundred points. The normal scoring format was used <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> reached fifty points. Once that happened, the bell rang to indicate it and each word played after that was worth double the points. Whoever reached 100 points won the game and the championship and got to play the Solo Game for the jackpot.|$|E

25|$|In Ancient Greece {{there was}} a sport called pankration, which {{featured}} a combination of grappling and striking skills {{similar to those found}} in modern MMA. Pankration was formed by a combination of the already established wrestling and boxing traditions and, in Olympic terms, first featured in the 33rd Olympiad, 648 BC. All strikes and holds were allowed with the exception of biting and gouging, which were banned. The fighters, called pankratiasts, fought <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> could not continue or signaled submission by raising their index finger; there were no rounds. According to E. Norman Gardiner, 'No branch of athletics was more popular than the pankration.' From its origins in Ancient Greece, pankration was later passed on to the Romans.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{paper money}} was first {{introduced}} in Sweden in 1661. Sweden was rich in copper, thus, because of copper's low value, extraordinarily big coins (often weighing several kilograms) had to be made. The advantages of paper currency were numerous: it reduced transport of gold and silver, and thus lowered the risks; it made loaning gold or silver at interest easier, since the specie (gold or silver) never left the possession of the lender <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> else redeemed the note; and it allowed for a division of currency into credit and specie backed forms. It enabled the sale of stock in joint stock companies, and the redemption of those shares in paper.|$|E
25|$|In the {{championship}} round each board was worth money, beginning at $200 and increasing by $100 {{for each additional}} board <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> won the game. Each board had a specific category for it and six words fitting that category on it. Henry read a clue {{for one of the}} words, and the first contestant to buzz in and correctly locate it was given twenty seconds to find the other five words. Doing so won the value of the board, but if the contestant could not do this the opposing contestant got a chance to steal by finding just one of the remaining words within five seconds. Doing so won the opponent the money attached to the board; otherwise, the money stayed with the first contestant.|$|E

Kubo moved to the United States at a relatively young age without any knowledge of the English language. For his inability to speak English, he was teased and thought of as [...] "slow".|$|R
25|$|Riiser-Larsen's {{years of}} polar {{exploration}} began in 1925 when his compatriot Roald Amundsen, the famed polar explorer, {{asked him to}} be his deputy and pilot for an attempt to fly over the North Pole. Riiser-Larsen agreed and secured the use of two Dornier Do J Wal seaplanes. The expedition, however, was forced to land close to the Pole, badly damaging one of the planes. After twenty-six days on an ice shelf, first trying to shovel tons of snow to create an airstrip, <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> suggested the easier way of tramping the snow surface, the expedition's six members squeezed themselves into the remaining plane. Riiser-Larsen somehow managed to coax the overloaded plane {{into the air and}} flew the expedition back to the coast of Northern Svalbard.|$|E
25|$|His wife {{contracted}} tuberculosis {{while in}} Australia, leaving her bedridden for years {{until her death}} in September 9, 1931. Devastated, Girault's behaviour increasingly became erratic and paranoid. One afternoon, around 1936, Girault started shouting at their neighbours for hours for no apparent reason. This continued on into the night <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> finally called the police who took him away. Two days later, his sons, Ernest and Frank, drove him to an insane asylum in Goodna, Queensland. He was admitted several more times into the asylum. He was on leave from Goodna, Queensland {{in the care of}} his son until 9 May 1940 when he was admitted to Dunwich Benevolent Asylum on Stradbroke Island on 16 July 1940 where he died in May 2, 1941 at the age of 57. His cause of death was officially listed as paraphrenia and exhaustion. He was buried at Dunwich and now lies in an unmarked grave.|$|E
25|$|On Friday episodes {{which ran}} short, {{during the first}} season, a game was played with {{audience}} members for a small cash prize, usually $50. The game was played with regular panelist Brett Somers first. A word or phrase with a blank would be asked of Somers, and she would write it down on her card. Rayburn would then circulate amongst audience members who raised their hands to play, and if the audience member matched the answer Somers had written down, then they would win $50. Rayburn would continue picking on audience members <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> matched the answer. If there was more time left, the same game would be played with Charles Nelson Reilly responding to and writing down an answer for another audience member to guess. Rayburn sometimes seemed frustrated by {{this part of the}} show and with the answers given by some of the audience members; {{at the end of one}} episode, he was shown collapsed in one of the audience seats, seemingly exhausted.|$|E

25|$|From {{the start}} Genie showed {{a small amount}} of {{responsiveness}} to nonverbal information, including gestures and facial expressions from other people, and made reasonably good eye contact. However, her demeanor was completely devoid of any expressions or discernible body language, and she could only nonverbally get across a few very basic needs. She clearly distinguished speaking from other sounds but remained almost completely silent and unresponsive to speech, and any responses she gave were to accompanying nonverbal signals. When upset Genie would wildly attack herself, but remained completely expressionless and never cried or vocalized; some accounts said she could not cry at all. To make noise, she would push chairs or other similar objects. Her outbursts initially occurred very often and had no discernible triggerâ€”Kent wrote that she never tried to indicate the source of her angerâ€”and continued <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> diverted her attention or she physically tired herself out, at which point she would again become silent and non-expressive.|$|E
25|$|After {{shakedown}} {{training off}} the New England coast, Snook departed New London on 3 March 1943 and set sail for the Pacific. Following a 12-day stopover at Pearl Harbor, the submarine put to sea on 11 April {{and headed for}} the Yellow Sea and East China Sea for her first war patrol. Upon completion of mine planting in the Shanghai area, Snook continued on up the coast of China to the Yellow Sea. On the afternoon of 5 May, she sighted two freighters standing out of Dairen and took up the chase. She trailed both until after nightfall, then fired a spread of three torpedoes that quickly sank Kinko Maru. The lead freighter continued, unaware of the attack, <b>until</b> <b>someone</b> on the sinking ship sounded a whistle. At that point, the freighter began a series of frantic maneuvers to dodge two of Snooks torpedoes, then opened fire with her guns, forcing the submarine to withdraw out of range, returning shortly after and firing three torpedoes, one of which hit Daifuku Maru amidships and sank her. Snook then resumed patrol.|$|E
