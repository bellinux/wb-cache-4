It {{has been previously}} noted that these two assessment procedures lead to different utilities. Purpose: To explain these discrepancies between chained and classic assessments. Methods: First, previous data are plotted in a uniform way to facilitate comparison. Second, using Time TradeOff and paired comparison data, we estimate {{the extent to which}} respondents adjust their responses when end points are varied. Data were obtained in various samples: in healthy volunteers from the general public, in students, and in women at high risk for breast cancer seeking genetic counseling. Results: We obtained 741 valid data records from a total of 106 participants. Our own data replicate the pattern found previously: when compared to classic <b>utilities</b> 1) <b>Chained</b> <b>utilities</b> are smaller (larger) when the best (worst) end point varies, 2) the discrepancies become smaller for utilities near 0 and 1. Our data reveal that there is a distinct failure to adjust responses when the end points are varied. The latter finding explains the robust pattern of discrepancies. Conclusions: Decision analyses that use a mix of classic and <b>chained</b> <b>utilities</b> are not on firm ground. One should be wary of normative interpretations of new value assessment procedures. Alternative interpretations of our findings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The Demand Activated Manufacturing Architecture (DAMA) project {{during the}} last five years of work with the U. S. Integrated Textile Complex (retail, apparel, textile, and fiber sectors) has {{developed}} an inter-enterprise architecture and collaborative model for supply chains. This model will enable improved collaborative business across any supply chain. The DAMA Model for Supply Chain Collaboration is a high-level model for collaboration to achieve Demand Activated Manufacturing. The five major elements of the architecture to support collaboration are (1) activity or process, (2) information, (3) application, (4) data, and (5) infrastructure. These five elements are tied to the application of the DAMA architecture to three phases of collaboration - prepare, pilot, and scale. There are six collaborative activities that may be employed in this model: (1) Develop Business Planning Agreements, (2) Define Products, (3) Forecast and Plan Capacity Commitments, (4) Schedule Product and Product Delivery, (5) Expedite Production and Delivery Exceptions, and (6) Populate Supply <b>Chain</b> <b>Utility.</b> The Supply <b>Chain</b> <b>Utility</b> is a set of applications implemented to support collaborative product definition, forecast visibility, planning, scheduling, and execution.

40|$|Traditionally, large {{integrated}} land-use {{and transport}} models require considerable amounts of computer resources, restricting their use {{to a small}} number of metropolitan or regional planning authorities and to an elite of consultancy firms. The increasing availability of microcomputers should be able to extend the use of models to a much larger community of planners. However, even the most efficient packages existing today cannot be fitted into the standard desk-top machines. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe a package for land-use and transport simulation for microcomputers, showing that this is not only possible, but also that there is no need to sacrifice detail or accuracy. Furthermore, the need to produce highly compact and efficient models has forced the research team to look for completely new algorithms and even new theoretical developments. In designing the models, economy of resources was also extended to data requirements, calibration, and evaluation, and considerable attention was devoted to making the models easy to handle and the results easy to interpret. The authors begin by describing the theoretical base of the models, briefly covering random <b>utility,</b> decision <b>chains,</b> and hierarchies. Next, a summary of the mathematical formulation is presented, finishing with a description of the operative characteristics of the computer programs and complementary features. ...|$|R

Causal <b>chain</b> analysis focuses on measuring the linkages between HRM inter- ventions and organizational outcomes mediated by employee attitudes and customer perceptions. We compared 144 managers’ reactions to both methods of utility analysis concerning the variables understandability, information quality, perceived usefulness, user information satisfaction, and intention to use. Causal chain analysis yielded higher results than single-attribute analysis for these variables, and a compound measure of these constructs supported this ﬁnding.

40|$|Network {{modelling}} {{provides an}} increasingly popular conceptualisation {{in a wide}} range of domains, including the analysis of protein structure. Typical approaches to analysis model parameter values at nodes within the network. The spherical locality around a node provides a microenvironment that can be used to characterise an area of a network rather than a particular point within it. Microenvironments that centre on the nodes in a protein chain can be used to quantify parameters that are related to protein functionality. They also permit particular patterns of such parameters in node-centred microenvironments to be used to locate sites of particular interest. This paper evaluates an approach to index generation that seeks to rapidly construct microenvironment data. The results show that index generation performs best when the radius of microenvironments matches the granularity of the index. Results are presented to show that such microenvironments improve the <b>utility</b> of protein <b>chain</b> parameters in classifying the structural characteristics of nodes using both support vector machines and neural networks...|$|R

40|$|Linear self-immolative {{polymers}} {{display a}} potential to address {{many of the}} limitations in the control over the degradation process in traditional biodegradable polymers. These materials are unique relative to most degradable  polymers, in that they undergo end-to-end depolymerization in  response to the cleavage of a stabilizing end-capping agent. Although one of their cited  attributes is a dependence of their degradation time on chain length, no conclusive study has been conducted to demonstrate and study this  effect. Using a previously reported linear self-immolative backbone derived from alternating 4 -hydroxybenzyl alcohol and N,N’-dimethylethylenediamine spacers, this work offers the first conclusive study demonstrating the proportional relationship between chain length and degradation time. This is accomplished using a set of monodisperse oligomers synthesized through a new convergent iterative route {{and a series of}} polymers optimized to display varying molecular weights. This work also describes the development and validation of a new linear self-immolative degradation model relating monomer kinetics to polymer degradation and shows its application in explaining oligomeric and polymeric degradation profiles. Collectively, this work provides the first quantitative evidence supporting the mixed pseudo zero- and first-order degradation kinetics of linear self-immolative polymers and proves the <b>utility</b> of <b>chain</b> length as an alternate means to tune the degradation time in linear self-immolative polymers. In the second focus of this thesis, a series of modified linear self-immolative amphiphilic block copolymer designs are proposed and evaluated in an effort to develop functional self-immolative nanoparticles for controlled release applications. Overall, the work presented in this thesis serves to expand the utility of linear self-immolative polymers for biomedical applications by demonstrating the flexibility of such systems through controlled design...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Before an {{autonomous}} agent can perform automated negotiation {{on behalf of}} a user in an electronic commerce transaction, the user’s preferences over the set of outcomes must be learned as accurately as possible. This paper presents a structure, a Conditional Outcome Preference Network (COP-network), for modeling preferences directly elicited from a user. The COP-network then expands to indicate all preferences that can be inferred as a result. The network can be easily checked for consistency and redundancy, and can be used to determine quickly whether one outcome is preferred over another. An important feature of the COPnetwork is that conditional preferences, where a user’s preference over outcomes depends on whether particular attribute values are included, can be modeled and inferred as well. If the agent also knows the user’s utilities for some of the possible outcomes, then these can be considered in the COP-network as well. Three techniques for estimating utilities based on the specified preferences and utilities are described. One such technique, which works by first estimating <b>utilities</b> for long <b>chains</b> of outcomes for which preferences are known, is shown to be the most effective. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives : In {{developing}} countries like India, {{the diagnosis of}} Pneumocystis jirovecii infection is often made either by conventional staining or clinically. This study was planned to know the <b>utility</b> of polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction (PCR) in diagnosing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected patients, to compare the PCR results with that of staining techniques and also to correlate the results with clinical condition of patients. Materials and Methods: A prospective study included 50 HIV-infected adult in-patients with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection. Induced sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage or tracheal aspirate were proceeded for both staining and PCR for mitochondrial large subunit rRNA gene of P. jirovecii. Results: In our study PCR results correlated with staining findings in 14 % (7 / 50) of cases. Another 20 % (10 / 50) cases could be diagnosed only with PCR, where staining was negative {{for the presence of}} P. jirovecii.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{differential}} diagnosis of B-cell lymphoproliferative processes remains {{a challenge for}} pathologists, dermatologists and oncologists, despite advances in histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular biology. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate aid and limitations of clonality analysis in the diagnosis of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas and B-cell pseudolymphomas. METHODS: This study included 29 cases of B-cell lymphoproliferative processes classified as primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (13), B-cell pseudolymphomas (6) and inconclusive cases (10) using histology and immunohistochemistry. The clonality analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of immunoglobulin light chain and heavy chain rearrangements. RESULTS: DNA quality was shown to be generally poor; eight samples were inadequate for polymerase chain reaction analysis. The results showed monoclonality in eight of the primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas and polyclonality {{in four of the}} B-cell pseudolymphomas. In addition, monoclonality was shown in two of the inconclusive cases by histology and immunohistochemistry, demonstrating the <b>utility</b> of polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction as an ancillary diagnostic tool for primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas. DISCUSSION: The low quality DNA extracted from these cases demanded the use of an IgH protocol that yielded small fragments and IgK. Both methods used together improved detection.

Aim: To discuss the pathogenesis and <b>utility</b> of light <b>chain</b> IF in nephropathies. Setting and Design: Retrospective study. Materials and Methods: The pattern of light chain IF and light microscopic diagnosis in 306 cases of various nephropathies was reviewed. Direct IF was done in all these cases with commercial fluorescence (Fluoresciene Isothiocynate) conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-human antisera against IgM, IgG, IgA, C 3, C 1 q, kappa and lambda light chains. Results: Light chain deposits were seen in 240 (78. 43 %) cases. In IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis and post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN), lambda positivity was more as compared to kappa. Light chain deposits in LCDD and membranous nephropathy were more kappa type. The IF pattern in amyloidosis was not consistent.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Mislabelling or {{contamination}} of surgical specimens {{may lead to}} diagnostic inaccuracy, particularly within gastrointestinal pathology when multiple small mucosal biopsy specimens are commonly taken, and where a tiny fragment of foreign tissue may be indistinguishable from true biopsy material using histological assessment alone.  AIMS—To assess the <b>utility</b> of polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction (PCR) based human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping techniques for the investigation of potentially mislabelled or contaminated gastrointestinal biopsy specimens.  PATIENTS—Ten cases (28  samples) in which mislabelling or contamination was suspected, comprising four upper gastrointestinal tract biopsies and six colonoscopic biopsy series.  METHODS—Direct and nested PCR-sequence specific primer (SSP) based HLA class II genotyping was performed on DNA extracted from formalin fixed and paraffin wax embedded tissue (23  samples) or peripheral blood leucocytes (five samples).  RESULTS—A full HLA-DRB 1 genotype was determined in all 28  samples. In seven cases the HLA-DRB 1 genotype of the putative contaminant was different {{to that of the}} corresponding reference tissue, confirming different individual origins for the contaminant and reference material. In one case the contaminant tissue was shown to possess the same HLA-DRB 1 alleles as a second patient (probable source).

It was confirmed that standard gamble scores are consistently higher than rating scale scores for both the experienced and the hypothetical states. The 3 -month test-retest reliability for hypothetical states measured by intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 33 for the rating scale and from 0. 43 to 0. 70 for the standard gamble.

These explanations also provided a wealth of empirical evidence to test the assumptions that underpin calls for change in the construction sector. It is concluded that supply chain management does not make sense in the construction sector and that calls for its adoption lacked intellectual rigour and were indeed acontextual...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{detect the}} {{prevalence}} of Chlamydia. Trachomatis infection symptomatic and asymptomatic in Egyptian females and to evaluate the diagnostic <b>utility</b> of polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction (PCR), direct immunofluorescence technique (DIF), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of C Trachomatis DNA, antigen and antibody respectively. Study design: The study included 70 females who have been classified into : 20 patients with tubal infertility, 15 patients with ectopic pregnancy, 20 patients with premature rupture of membrane (PROM) and 15 apparently healthy women (asymptomatic group). Endocervical specimens, vaginal swab and 3 ml blood samples have been collected from all subjects and stored at ­ 20 C till being processed. PCR,DIF and ELISA techniques have been done to detect C. Trachomatis DNA, antigen and antibody respectively. Results: C. Trachomatis DNA was detected by PCR in the endocervix of 17 out of 55 infected cases (30. 9 %). however DIF technique was positive for 21. 6 % of patient groups and 13. 3 % of asymptomatic group. The tubal infertility group showed {{the highest percentage of}} active C. Trachomatis infection (45 %) (P< 0. 05) PCR showed better sensitivity than DIF for detection of C. Trachomatis infection (96. 2 % versus 70 % respectively), however both techniques had 100 % specificity. Tubal infertility group showed highest sero prevalence (45 %), followed by ectopic pregnancy group (35 %) (P= 0. 001 and P< 0. 05 respectively). Conclusions: PCR procedure is suitable for confirmation of ELISA results in high-volume laboratories. Cost, experience of the laboratory personnel and the patient well-being {{must be taken into account}} to select the test for the detection of C. Trachomatis infections...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the <b>utility</b> of polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction (PCR) for diagnosing pediatric pulmonary tuberculosis (PPTB). Method: A prospective cross-sectional study {{was carried out}} on 100 children less than 14 years of age, with strong clinical suspicion and radiological evidence suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Sputum samples/gastric lavage were collected. Direct smears and culture on Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) media were performed. DNA extraction and amplification was performed using Genei™ Amplification Reagent set for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) (by Genei, Bangalore, India). This test {{is based on the}} principle of single-tube nested PCR which amplifies the repetitive insertion sequence IS 6110. Results: When compared with culture, sensitivity and specificity of PCR was 93. 55 % and 92. 75 %, respectively. The PPV was 85. 29 % and the NPV was 96. 97 %. When intention to treat (ITT) was used as the standard, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of PCR was 47. 88 %, 93. 1 %, 94. 4 %, and 42. 19 %, respectively, and that of culture was 40. 85 %, 100 %, 100 % and 40. 85 %, respectively. Against response to treatment (RTT), PCR demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 50. 9 %, 93. 1 %, 93. 33 % and 50 %, respectively, and for culture it was 43. 64 %, 100 %, 100 % and 48. 33 %, respectively. Conclusion/recommendation: The present study reinforces better case detection rate with PCR-based nucleic acid amplification test as compared with microscopy and culture in pediatric pulmonary TB. PCR showed a higher correlation with clinical diagnosis as compared with microscopy and solid culture. Hence, a molecular platform should be the test of choice for detecting PPTB...|$|R
40|$|Infection with Ornithobilharzia turkestanicum {{has been}} {{reported}} {{in a wide range of}} animals worldwide. This study was undertaken to assess the <b>utility</b> of polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction (PCR), for detecting the infection with O. turkestanicum larvae stages in Lymnaea gedrosiana. A total of 6, 759 Lymnaeidae snails were collected from six aquatic habitats in West Azarbaijan, northwest Iran. Of these, the snails of L. gedrosiana were identified. To detect infected L. gedrosiana with the larval stages of O. turkestanicum, they were subjected for cercarial shedding and molecular examinations. The genomic DNA was extracted and PCR was performed to specifically amplify a fragment of the nuclear 28 SrRNA gene of O. turkestanicum. Of all collected snails, 5. 4 % (365 / 6, 759) were the snails of L. gedrosiana. The cercarial shedding method revealed that 23. 56 % (86 / 365) of the snails were infected. The PCR patterns confirmed that 28. 77 % (105 / 365) snails of L. gedrosiana were infected with larval stages of O. turkestanicum. The infected snails were observed in five studied sites. The highest infection rate (66. 66 %, 20 / 30) was recorded in the snails of Ghargologh in the northern part. Only 35. 24 % (37 / 105) of the infected snails were from the plain areas, whereas the remaining existed in high altitudes. It was concluded PCR method could be an efficient and fast method for uncovering the actual rate of infection with larval stages of O. turkestanicum in the snails of L. gedrosiana. This method can be also useful for the domestic animals and public health management programs in the country...|$|R
