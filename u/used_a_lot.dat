5|$|Although it is {{recorded}} that the Han Dynasty (202 BC– AD 220) court eunuch Cai Lun (50 AD– AD 121) invented the pulp papermaking process and established {{the use of}} new materials used in making paper, ancient padding and wrapping paper artifacts dating to the 2nd century BC {{have been found in}} China, the oldest example of pulp papermaking being a map from Fangmatan, Tianshui; by the 3rd century, paper as a writing medium was in widespread use, replacing traditional but more expensive writing mediums such as strips of bamboo rolled into threaded scrolls, strips of silk, wet clay tablets hardened later in a furnace, and wooden tablets. The earliest known piece of paper with writing on it was discovered in the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, where Han Dynasty troops had deserted their position in AD 110 following a Xiongnu attack. In the paper making process established by Cai in 105, a boiled mixture of mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens and fish nets created a pulp that was pounded into paste and stirred with water; a wooden frame sieve with a mat of sewn reeds was then dunked into the mixture, which was then shaken and then dried into sheets of paper that were bleached under the exposure of sunlight; K.S. Tom says this process was gradually improved through leaching, polishing and glazing to produce a smooth, strong paper. Paper is <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b>|$|E

25|$|Jethro Burns, {{best known}} as half of the comedy duo Homer and Jethro, {{was also the first}} {{important}} jazz mandolinist. Tiny Moore popularized the mandolin in Western swing music. He initially played an 8-string Gibson but switched after 1952 to a 5-string solidbody electric instrument built by Paul Bigsby. Modern players David Grisman, Sam Bush, and Mike Marshall, among others, have worked since the early 1970s to demonstrate the mandolin's versatility for all styles of music. Chris Thile of California is a well-known player, and has accomplished many feats of traditional bluegrass, classical, contemporary pop and rock; the band Nickel Creek featured his playing in its blend of traditional and pop styles, and he now plays in his band Punch Brothers.

500|$|During {{the writing}} for the season, Ward and series' head writer Kent Osborne noted that it was {{increasingly}} difficult to produce new episode concepts because the writers had [...] "already <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of cool ideas". Osborne called this slump the [...] "season four blues". Ward went on to clarify that, [...] "everything's still coming out super weird and interesting—but it just gets a little harder. You have to dig deeper." [...] To combat these issues, the writer staff tried different story writing methods, such as a technique called exquisite corpse, in which one writer starts a story {{on a sheet of}} paper, and the paper is folded and another writer tries to finish it. Ward, however, noted that [...] "the ideas are usually terrible". They also decided to experiment with different types of storytelling and to introduce more new characters to the show.|$|E
