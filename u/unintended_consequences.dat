5|$|Even if {{an ancient}} and {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization wished to help humanity, humans could {{suffer from a}} loss of identity and confidence due to the technological and cultural prowess of the extraterrestrial civilization. However, a friendly civilization may calibrate its contact with humanity {{in such a way}} as to minimize <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences.</b> Michael A. G. Michaud suggests that a friendly and advanced extraterrestrial civilization may even avoid all contact with an emerging intelligent species like humanity, to ensure that the less advanced civilization can develop naturally at its own pace; this is known as the zoo hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Writing in {{the journal}} Social Problems, Jessica Fields {{characterized}} Not in Front of the Children as a significant monograph which effectively criticized the rhetoric of protection of the sexual purity of youths {{as a form of}} ideology. Cynthia A. McDaniel wrote in a piece for the journal Counterpoints assessing that Heins had put forth a thesis that attempting to shield youths from events led to negative <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences.</b> McDaniel emphasized that rationale debate is key to a functional society which values freedom of choice. She wrote that debate and introspection were critical to growth in this area, {{in order to determine the}} need to modify behavior patterns.|$|E
5|$|The film {{presents}} {{examples of}} crowd psychology and collective behavior {{which can lead}} to mass hysteria and the loss of social order. The bafflement, outrage, and helplessness associated with the lack of information, combined with new media such as blogs, allow conspiracy theorists like Krumwiede to spread disinformation and fear, which become dangerous contagions themselves. Dr. Cheever must balance the need for full disclosure but avoid a panic and allow the time to characterize and respond to an unknown virus. The movie indirectly critiques the greed, selfishness, and hypocrisy of isolated acts in contemporary culture and the <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences</b> they can have {{in the context of a}} pandemic. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends social distancing by forcibly isolating the healthy to limit the spread of the disease, which stands in stark opposition to contemporary demands for social networking. Responding to the pandemic presents a paradox, as the contagiousness and lethality of the virus instills deep distrust of others but surviving and limiting the spread of the disease also requires individuals to work together.|$|E

The authors analyze the health care reforms to assess the potential for increased insurance coverage among persons with disabilities.

25|$|The cost {{of adding}} {{fluoridation}} {{to the water}} of 44 Florida communities has been researched by the State Health Office in Tallahassee.

The estimated cost rises to $2.12 per person in areas with a population below 10,000. <b>Unintended</b> <b>consequences,</b> such as equipment malfunction, can substantially raise the financial burden, as well as the health risks, to the consumer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unintended</b> <b>Consequences</b> is a {{novel by}} John Ross, first {{published}} in 1996 by Accurate Press. The story chronicles {{the history of the}} gun culture, gun rights, and gun control in the United States from the early 1900s through the late 1990s. Although clearly a work of fiction, the story is heavily laced with historical fact, including historical figures who play minor supporting roles. The protagonist is very active in competitive shooting sports, as is the author; so unusually detailed and intricate facts, figures and explanations of firearms-related topics, ornament the narrative and drive the plot.|$|E
25|$|Cities with overbuilt roadways have {{experienced}} <b>unintended</b> <b>consequences,</b> linked to radical drops in public transport, walking, and cycling. In many cases, streets became void of âlife.â Stores, schools, government centers and libraries {{moved away from}} central cities, and residents who did not flee to the suburbs experienced a much reduced quality of public space and of public services. As schools were closed their mega-school replacements in outlying areas generated additional traffic; the number of cars on US roads between 7:15 and 8:15a.m. increases 30% during the school year.|$|E
