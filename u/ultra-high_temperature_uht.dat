40|$|Two {{petrographic}} {{types of}} rutile are {{observed in the}} peraluminous felsic meta-igneous granulites, {{the most common type}} of the lower crustal xenolith suite of the Spanish Central System (SCS). Rutile- 1 (Rt- 1) corresponds to small crystals (mainly < 80 mm) only preserved as micro-inclusions within garnet, whereas rutile- 2 (Rt- 2) is commonly found as big idiomorfic crystals forming the granulite granoblastic matrix. Chemical analyses by EMP show a higher Zr content in Rt- 1 (up to 7800 ppm) than in Rt- 2 (up to 5200 ppm) of the same granulite. Applying Zr-in-rutile thermometry, Rt- 1 gives 50 - 60 ºC higher for rutile crystallization (950 - 1015 ºC) when compared to Rt- 2 thermometry (940 - 955 ºC).

Moreover, quaternary structure of lupin proteins was influenced upon heat treatment displayed with molecular weight distribution (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis).

In addition, the immune responses against β-casein, of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) from CMA patients, before and after the protocol were evaluated and compared to a nonallergic population. [Methods]: A group of 20 children with IgE-mediated CMA and 15 nonallergic children were recruited. Allergic subjects underwent an OIT protocol based on weekly doses of commercial semi-skimmed <b>ultra-high</b> <b>temperature</b> treated (<b>UHT)</b> CM, followed by a maintenance phase. Immune profiles and changes in all subjects were investigated by measuring Th 1, Th 2, and Treg cytokines, transcription factors, and specific IgE and IgG 4 levels. [Results]: The CMOIT protocol enabled to desensitize 70 % of the allergic patients. Successful OIT was accompanied by significant increases in casein-specific IgG 4 levels, together with a reduction in the concentration of antigen-specific IgE and in IL- 5, IL- 13, and IL- 10 production by β-casein-stimulated PBMCs. Baseline significant differences observed between allergic and nonallergic children in IL- 13 and IL- 5 levels were no longer found once the protocol had finished. [Conclusions]: The OIT protocol was safe and effective in inducing milk desensitization in 70 % of the children with CMA, leading to alterations in their immune profiles toward a nonallergic phenotype.

40|$|Milk {{is a very}} nutritious {{and widely}} {{consumed}} food, {{as well as a}} versatile raw material for the food industry. Processing involves converting raw milk into a wide range of dairy-based food products. Advanced processing technologies such as <b>ultra-high</b> <b>temperatures</b> (<b>UHT)</b> result in production and transportation efficiencies, extended shelf-life and wider distribution. The objectives of this study were to (i) identify the raw material quality of UHT-treated milk by monitoring protease activity, (ii) develop shelf-stable formulations of dairy beverages enriched with protein and dietary fibre, and iii) utilise protein enrichment to provide highly nutritious dairy-based desserts thus meeting consumer nutritional expectations. Protease activity in UHT-treated milk was determined in relation to age-gelation during room temperature storage. Proteases, from psychrotrophic Pseudomonas spp., which are strongly associated with age-gelation in UHT milks, were extracted and added to raw skim milk at 0 to 0. 005 % (v/v). Protease activity before and after UHT treatment (135 oC/ 2 s) was estimated using the FITC-casein assay. During storage, the microbial count and pH of the samples remained the same to that recorded immediately after UHT treatment. The association between peptide generation and added enzyme extract in UHT-milk can also be related to their shelf-life. When gelation was identifiable visually, the viscosity produced by the free amino groups in samples with added crude protease was similar, irrespective of the enzyme concentration added. The relationship between threshold enzymatic activity and storage of the UHT-treated milk was estimated from an empirically derived equation (R 2 of 0. 9943) : y (shelf-life in weeks) = 9. 6301 x- 2. 12; where x is the enzyme activity in terms of FITC isomer 1 (× 10 - 4 nM). Increasing consumer interest in a healthy diet in terms of protein, dietary fibre and energy intake opens opportunities for the development of novel dairy-based products. Reverse formulation engineering of selected commercial dairy beverages was performed by investigating their nutritional composition and steady-shear flow behaviour leading to the development of formulations enriched with protein and dietary fibre. Characterisation of physicochemical properties (and colour) of novel formulations containing 6. 1 % (w/w) protein and 2 % (w/w) dietary fibre and the commercial product indicated that both systems are similar; an outcome which was further confirmed by consumers acceptance of the novel dairy beverage during sensory evaluation. Similar to earlier work, reverse formulation engineering of commercial dairy desserts was carried out by establishing a database of steady-shear flow and textural profile that had to be imitated in novel formulations. Whey protein and/or casein were incorporated to achieve high levels of protein (11. 5 % w/w) and leucine (1. 2 % w/w). The physicochemical properties (steady shear viscosity, small deformation dynamic oscillatory in shear and texture profile) of the protein-enriched dairy desserts were examined. The textural characteristics of the enriched and commercial products were similar, even though the latter had 50 % less protein than the novel formulations. Rheology results and microscopy images of both the commercial product and the protein-enriched dairy desserts indicate similar structural features. Moreover, results from sensory evaluation revealed that the nutritious dairy desserts were liked by consumers...|$|R

Rocks measured are meta-igneous UHT rocks collected from Mount Riiser-Larsen, Amundsen Bay, Napier Complex. Core rock samples 14 mm {{in diameter and}} 12 mm long were subjected to high-pressure experiments. All rocks show a rapid increase of Vp at low pressure up to 0. 5 Gpa and nearly constant Vp at higher pressures. The Vp values measured at 1. 0 Gpa and 400 °C are 7. 17 km/s for a metapyroxenite, 6. 93 km/s, 6. 88 km/s for mafic granulites and 6. 17 km/s for an orthopyroxene felsic gneiss. A well-defined correlation exists between Vp and the SiO_ 2 content of the rocks, which is expressed as Vp (km/s) =- 0. 051 SiO_ 2 + 9. 85 at 1. 0 Gpa and 25 ℃.

For non-acidified samples, increasing pH of retentate resulted in higher viscosities and quicker age gelation times. Destabilization occurred more rapidly at 37 °C than at 23 °C or 11 °C. The pH drop tended to be greater for samples stored at a higher temperature or adjusted to a higher pH. During 28 weeks of 37 °C storage the pH decreased from 6. 54 to 6. 06. During 32 weeks of 23 °C storage pH of samples initially adjusted to pH 7. 32 dropped to 7. 06. ζ-Potentials of casein micelles were calculated from electrophoretic mobility obtained by measuring Doppler frequency shifts of scattered laser light in samples that had been diluted 300 fold with their own ultra. filtrate. Absolute values of ζ-potential of samples stored at 37 °C decreased from - 23. 4 millivolts immediately after <b>ultra-high</b> <b>temperature</b> processing to - 18. 5 millivolts after 28 weeks of storage. For samples stored at 11 °C and 23 °C in the storage temperature study and control samples in the pH study, absolute values of ζ-potential decreased approximately 1. 5 to 2. 0 millivolts during 28 or 32 weeks of storage...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{modeling}} and design efforts for many aerospace components require high temperature emittance data. Applications requiring emittance data include propulsion systems, radiators, aeroshells, heatshields/thermal protection systems, and leading edge surfaces. The {{objective of this}} work is to provide emittance data at <b>ultra-high</b> <b>temperatures.</b> MSFC has a new instrument for the measurement of emittance at <b>ultra-high</b> <b>temperatures,</b> the <b>Ultra-High</b> <b>Temperature</b> Emissometer System (Ultra-HITEMS). AZ Technology Inc. developed the instrument, designed to provide emittance measurements over the temperature range 700 - 3500 K. The Ultra-HITEMS instrument measures the emittance of samples, heated by lasers, in vacuum, using a blackbody source and a Fourier Transform Spectrometer. Detectors in a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer measure emittance over the spectral range of 0. 4 - 25 microns. Emitted energy from the specimen and output from a Mikron M 390 S blackbody source at the same temperature with matched collection geometry are measured. Integrating emittance over the spectral range yields the total emittance. The ratio provides a direct measure of total hemispherical emittance. Samples are heated using lasers. Optical pyrometry provides temperature data. Optical filters prevent interference from the heating lasers. Data for Inconel 718 show excellent agreement with results from literature and ASTM 835. Measurements taken from levitated spherical specimens provide total hemispherical emittance data; measurements taken from flat specimens mounted in the chamber provide near-normal emittance data. Data from selected characterization studies will be presented. The Ultra-HITEMS technique could advance space and missile technologies by advancing the knowledge base and the technology readiness level for <b>ultra-high</b> <b>temperature</b> materials...|$|R
