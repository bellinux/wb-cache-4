40|$|Long {{duration}} spaceflight (i. e., 22 days or longer) {{has been}} associated with changes in sensorimotor systems, resulting in difficulties that astronauts experience with posture control, locomotion, and manual control. The microgravity environment is an important causal factor for spaceflight induced sensorimotor changes. Whether these sensorimotor changes are solely related to peripheral changes from reduced vestibular stimulation, body <b>unloading,</b> <b>body</b> fluid shifts or that they may be related to structural and functional brain changes is yet unknown. However, a recent study reported associations between microgravity and flattening of the posterior eye globe and protrusion of the optic nerve [1] possibly as the result of increased intracranial pressure due to microgravity induced bodily fluid shifts [3]. Moreover, elevated intracranial pressure has been related to white matter microstructural damage [2]. Thus, it is possible that spaceflight may affect brain structure and thereby cognitive functioning. Long duration head down tilt bed rest has been suggested as an exclusionary analog to study microgravity effects on the sensorimotor system [4]. Bed rest mimics microgravity in body unloading and bodily fluid shifts. In consideration of the health and performance of crewmembers both in- and post-flight, we are conducting a prospective longitudinal 70 -day bed rest study as an analog to investigate the effects of microgravity on brain structure [5]. Here we present results of the first six subjects. Six subjects were assessed at 12 and 7 days before-, at 7, 30, and ~ 70 days in-, and at 8 and 12 days post 70 days of bed rest at the NASA bed rest facility in UTMB, Galveston, TX, USA. At each time point structural MRI scans (i. e., high resolution T 1 -weighted imaging and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)) were obtained using a 3 T Siemens scanner. Focal changes over time in gray matter density were assessed using the voxel based morphometry 8 (VBM 8) toolbox under SPM. Longitudinal processing in VBM 8 includes linear registration of each scan to the mean of the subject and subsequently transforming all scans in to MNI space by applying the warp from the mean subject to MNI to the individual gray matter segmentations. Modulation was applied so that all images represented the volume of the original structure in native space. Voxel wise analysis was carried out on the gray matter images after smoothing, using a flexible factorial design with family wise error correction. Focal changes in white matter microstructural integrity were assessed using tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) as part of FMRIB software library (FSL). TBSS registers all DTI scans to standard space. It subsequently creates a study specific white matter skeleton of the major white matter tracts. For each subject, for each DTI metric (i. e. fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD)), the maximum value in a line perpendicular to the skeleton tract is projected to the skeleton. Non-parametric permutation based t-tests and ANOVA's were used for voxel-wise comparison of the skeletons. For both VBM and TBSS, comparison of pre bed rest measurements did not show significant differences. VBM analysis revealed decreased gray matter density in bilateral areas including the frontal medial cortex, the insular cortex and the caudate (see Figure) from 'pre to in bed rest'. Over the same time period, there was an increase in gray matter density in the cerebellum, occipital-, and parietal cortex, including the precuneus (see Figure). The majority of these changes did not recover from 'during to post bed rest'. TBSS analysis did not reveal significant changes in white matter microstructural integrity after correction for multiple comparisons. Uncorrected analyses (p<. 015) revealed an increase in RD in the cerebellum and brainstem from pre bed rest to the first week in bed rest that did not recover post bed rest. Extended bed rest, which is an analog for microgravity, can result in gray matter changes and potentially in microstructural white matter changes in areas that are important for neuro motor behavior and cognition. These changes did not recover at two weeks post bed rest. Whether the effects of bed rest wear off at longer times post bed rest, and if they are associated with behavior are important questions that warrant further research...|$|E

For those with physical disabilities, the challenge is greater and the stakes are higher. To counter the loss of mobility, strength, and endurance that often accompanies a disabling condition, a variety of interventions have been studied to improve physical fitness and reduce the weight-bearing challenges associated with walking.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{residual stress}} modeling in soft living tissues. The word living {{means that the}} tissue interacts with surrounding organs and that it can change its internal properties to optimize its function. From the first day all tissues are under pressure, due, for example, to gravity, other surrounding organs that utilize pressure on the specific tissue, and the pressure from the blood that circulates within the body. This means that all organs grow and change properties under load, and an unloaded configuration is never present within the body. When a tissue {{is removed from the}} <b>body,</b> the obtained <b>unloaded</b> state is not naturally stress free. This stress within an <b>unloaded</b> <b>body</b> is called residual stress. It is believed that the residual stress helps the tissue to optimize its function by homogenizing the transmural stress distribution. The thesis is composed of two parts: in the first part an introduction to soft tissues and basic modeling is given and the second part consist of a collection of five manuscripts. The first four papers show how residual stress can be modeled. We also derive evolution equation for growth and remodeling and show how residual stress develops under constant pressure.

Sural nerve stimulation was applied at two times perception threshold during different phases of the step cycle. Reflex amplitudes increased with <b>body</b> <b>unloading</b> and decreased with body loading. The reflex responses were not a simple function {{of the level of}} background activity. For example, in GM and SO, the largest reflex responses occurred during walking with <b>body</b> <b>unloading,</b> when background activity was decreased. Hence, stable ground conditions (body loading) yielded smaller reflexes. It is proposed that load receptors are involved in the regulation of cutaneous reflex responses in order to adapt the locomotor pattern to the environmental conditions. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} changes of {{vertical}} contact forces, lower limb kinematics, and electromyographic activity (EMG) at different speeds and gravitational loads. To this end healthy {{subjects were asked}} to walk on a motorized treadmill while the percentage of <b>body</b> weight <b>unloaded</b> (<b>body</b> weight support, BWS) was modified in steps by means of a well-characterized unloading system. BWS was set at 0, 35, 50, 75, 95, or 100 % of body weight. Walking speed was 0. 7, 1. 1, 2, 3, or 5 km/ h. We found that changing BWS between 0 and 95 % resulted in drastic changes of kinetic parameters but in limited changes of the kinematic coordination. In particular, the peak vertical contact forces decreased proportionally to BWS; at 95 %-BWS they were 20 -fold smaller than at 0 % and were applied at the forefoot only. Also, there were considerable changes of the amplitude of EMG activity of all tested lower limb muscles and a complex re-organization of the pattern of activity of thigh muscles. By contrast, the corresponding variation of the parameters that describe shape and variability of the foot path was very limited, always < 30 % of the corresponding values at 0 BWS. Moreover, the planar covariation of the elevation angles was obeyed at all speed and BWS values. Minimum variance of limb trajectory occurred at 3 km/ h. At 100 % BWS, subjects stepped in the air, their feet oscillating back and forth just above but never contacting the treadmill. In this case, step-to-step variability of foot path was much greater than at all other BWS levels but was restored to lower values when minimal surrogate contact forces were provided during the "stance" phase. The results did not depend on the specific instruction given to the subject. Therefore we conclude that minimal contact forces are sufficient for accurate foot trajectory control...|$|R

40|$|An {{effective}} and often prescribed compound exercise {{for the lower}} limb is the squat movement. The purpose {{of this research was}} to determine if the leading joint hypothesis exists when squatting, that is one joint creates a dynamic foundation for motion of the entire limb. To contribute to future exercise prescription guidelines the influence of mediolateral and anteroposterior movement, the timing of the knees, and the influence of segment lengths were investigated in 29 subjects from a cross sectional back ground of sport and strength training. Subjects performed two types of squats; <b>unloaded</b> <b>body</b> weight squats and barbell squats with 50 % body weight added. The 3 D kinematics of the lower limb and torso were assessed with the independent variables of load, stance, phase and gender. The movement of the knees when squatting was found to support the leading joint hypothesis. The knee changed mediolateral and anteroposterior position to accommodate variations in load and stance width. The knee was also found to move past the alignment of the anteroposterior displacement of the knee, did not remain aligned with heel width, direction of the toes or anterior position of the toes. The amount of anteriorposterior displacement of the knee, with respect to the foot, varied between gender and this movement is considered anatomically appropriate and therefore should be encouraged in exercise prescription. Despite the literature, and this current research, generally supporting deep squats and the freedom for the knee to move anterior of the toes, there exists an inappropriate perception in some practical settings to restrict this movement pattern. Based on this research practitioners should allow an athletes’ knees move in both mediolateral and anteroposterior direction when squatting and not remain aligned with heel width, direction of the toes, or anterior position of toes. Knee behaviour in squatting appears to be strategic and occurs in a specific order of the timing in the squat movement. Movement anterior of the toes is a normal and required part of the squat movement that should be encouraged where appropriate and when practitioners feel the clients’ knees are healthy or normal...|$|R
40|$|It is {{customary}} {{to weigh}} the organs removed at necropsy and these measurements provide objective criteria of atrophy, hypertrophy, and disease. However, surprisingly few mortuaries have facilities for weighing whole bodies. When this hospital opened in 1970 attempts to obtain a body weighing machine {{within the limits of}} the budget were un-successful and a simple modification of the body elevating machine was devised which enabled each body to be quickly and easily weighed. Method A gallows beam of 50 mm square structural tube is held permanently in place by a locking screw in a fabricated mounting made of 6 mm steel plate, the whole being galvanised. The long-handled locking screw facilitates easy dismantling if required. The mounting is bolted {{to the top of a}} power-operated Gibbons mortuary stacking machitie (model H 5053 M) (Fig. 1). A spring balance with a capacity of 200 kg, by division of 1 kg, is suspended from the beam, and to the balance four chains are attached which can be fixed by hooks to the four corners of an unmodified steel body tray. The tare is adjusted with the chains and tray in position. Cadavers may be conveniently weighed while being removed from the body store: the tray carrying the body and supported by the elevator is attached to the balance by four chains. The elevator support is then lowered until the tray and the body are freely suspended and the weight is read from the spring balance (Fig. 2). The method was devised to suit the model of stacking machine available in the mortuary. However, it can be adapted to other models which lack the necessary upright frame by building a gallows beam into the fabric of the mortuary at some convenient place (Pike, C., personal communication). This modification of the stacking machine is robust and has functioned satisfactorily for seven years.

30|$|Firefighters’ input in {{this study}} also showed that they {{experience}} soreness in the shoulder and back, which is related to wearing SCBA. Previous studies found that wearing SCBA is positively related to loss of body balance and fall injuries on the fire ground by shifting the body’s center of gravity and causing gait instability (Park et al. 2010). By wearing the SCBA (weighing about 30 – 40 pounds) on the back, the firefighter’s center of gravity shifts upward and backward from the pelvis (original location of <b>unloaded</b> <b>body).</b> The gravity shift caused by wearing the heavy SCBA may have greater impacts on mobility to lighter-weight firefighters, since the ratio of body mass to weight of load carriage is a critical factor to fatigue increase (Marshall 1980). Similarly, {{the negative impact of}} wearing SCBA can be greater to shorter firefighters who may have less body mass as the shift of center of gravity is dominated by the additional weight and the dimensions of the air pack, relative to the body profile; taller firefighters have a relatively longer torso allowing them to lower the SCBA resulting in improved neck mobility and possibly alleviating the impact of SCBA on the shifting of the center of mass. Griefahn et al. (2003) demonstrated that lowering the weight distribution of the air pack on the back could improve firefighters’ mobility and work experience. They reported that rucksack style SCBA, featuring a lower placement of the air pack and an even weight distribution throughout the back, resulted in faster task completion with less fatigue than a conventional cylindrical shaped SCBA. Based on the aforementioned ergonomic consideration and previous research, an attempt to lower the placement of the air pack may minimize the shifting of the center of gravity, as well as avert physical conflicts with the back brim of the helmet, thus improving body balance and the range of motion around the neck area in firefighters. Research and design efforts to distribute the weight of the air pack more evenly around the torso are necessary in order to alleviate back pains and muscle soreness. Park et al. (2013) study affirmed that wearing a backpack can result in chronic lumbar pain over time. Furthermore, relocating coat pockets should also be considered in order to enhance firefighter access to their tools while wearing the SCBA.|$|R

In this thesis we investigate which finite element method (FEM) is most suitable [or breast models.

Between CGFErv! and DGFEM the results show similar behaviour with respect to the element size, with algebraic convergence of the error with rate which is determined by the polynomial order of the basis function used.

One step being carried out is to reduce losses in powertrains and increase the fuel efficiency for solutions such as articulated haulers and wheel loaders. This would eventually lower the fuel costs and emissions for the end customer. With this development, Volvo CE could strengthen their position in the market while also contributing to reducing the construction industry's environmental impact. By investigating the front bogie axle of the recently introduced hauler, Volvo A 60 H, important information about possible reductions and the distribution of the current losses were found. The investigation focused on a front bogie axle, but some of the results are applicable for other applications such as wheel loaders as well, since a lot of the technology in the axles are similar. A conceptual study was performed where completely new ideas were generated, such as implementing a dry sump system in the axle, as well as ideas for improving the subcomponents currently found in the axle. Two cases were presented for the evaluation of concepts, one with a fully loaded dump body and low speeds, and one with an <b>unloaded</b> dump <b>body</b> and a wider speed interval. The concepts were later evaluated using calculation tools such as MATLAB and a Simulink-model was created for the losses in the axle. When combining concepts that reduces load dependent losses, a potential reduction of 64 % of the axle's total losses was achieved for the case with a full dump body. The largest improvement found for the load independent losses was 8 % with an unloaded hauler and the highest speed investigated, 50 km/h. A dry sump system improves the axle's efficiency with 45 % in optimal working conditions, but was found to lower the efficiency at other conditions. Room for improvement of axle losses currently exists both for load dependent and load independent losses. The evaluation performed pointed towards the load dependent losses being the largest influence on the total losses, even with an <b>unloaded</b> dump <b>body</b> and high speeds. This is an interesting observation since a lot of work at Volvo CE has revolved around reducing the load independent losses since these are easier to affect with different lubrication levels and rotational speeds.

The microgravity {{environment is}} an important causal factor for spaceflight induced sensorimotor changes through direct effects on peripheral changes that result from reduced vestibular stimulation and <b>body</b> <b>unloading.</b> Effects of microgravity on sensorimotor function have been investigated on earth using bed rest studies. Long duration bed rest serves as a space-flight analogue because it mimics microgravity in <b>body</b> <b>unloading</b> and bodily fluid shifts.

Despite significant time spent performing in-flight exercise routines, these training programs {{have not been able}} to mitigate postflight alterations in postural and locomotor function. Therefore, the goal of our two inter-related projects (NSBRI-ground based and ISS flight study, "Mobility") is to develop and test gait training programs that will serve to optimize functional mobility during the adaptation period immediately following space flight, thereby improving the safety and efficiency of planetary ambulation. The gait training program entails manipulating the sensory conditions of treadmill exercise to systematically challenge the balance and gait control system. This enhances the overall adaptability of locomotor function enabling rapid reorganization of gait control to respond to ambulation in different gravitational environments. To develop the training program, we are conducting a series of ground-based studies evaluating the training efficacy associated with variation in visual flow, body loading, and support surface stability during treadmill walking. We will also determine the optimal method to present training stimuli within and across training sessions to maximize both the efficacy and efficiency of the training procedure. Results indicate that variations in both visual flow and <b>body</b> <b>unloading</b> during treadmill walking leads to modification in locomotor control and can be used as effective training modalities. Additionally, the composition and timing of sensory challenges experienced during each training session has significant impact on the ability to rapidly reorganize locomotor function when exposed to a novel sensory environment.

Gait analyses were conducted on 20 non-obese and 20 obese children (8 - 12 years). The first testing session was completed in a normal (unloaded) condition; an additional 10 % body mass (acute loading) was added during the second session. Peak lower extremity joint power (W) phases were identified at weight acceptance and propulsion. Obese children demonstrated greater joint powers than non-obese children, at both weight acceptance and propulsion.

Only the ankle had greater power generation after accounting for body mass. The findings suggest that obese children must increase muscular contraction force to maintain normal gait function.

Bed-rest provides the opportunity for us to investigate the role of prolonged axial <b>body</b> <b>unloading</b> in isolation from the other physiological effects produced by exposure to the microgravity environment of space flight. Therefore, the bed rest analog allows us to investigate the impact of <b>body</b> <b>unloading</b> on both functional tasks and on the underlying physiological factors that lead to decrement in performance and then compare them with the results obtained in our space flight study. Functional tests included ladder climbing, hatch opening, jump down, manual manipulation of objects and tool use, seat egress and obstacle avoidance, recovery from a fall and object translation tasks. Physiological measures included assessments of postural and gait control, dynamic visual acuity, fine motor control, plasma volume, heart rate, blood pressure, orthostatic intolerance, upper- and lower-body muscle strength, power, endurance, control, and neuromuscular drive. ISS crewmembers were tested three times before flight, and on 1, 6, and 30 days after landing. Bed-rest subjects were tested three times before bed-rest and immediately after getting up from bed-rest as well as 1, 6, and 12 days after reambulation...|$|R
5000|$|The chopped-up {{remains of}} 18 {{bodies were found}} inside a Toyota Sienna and Ford EcoSport near the U.S. retiree {{communities}} in Chapala, Jalisco, {{just south of the}} city of Guadalajara. Eighteen heads were found along the dismembered bodies; some had been frozen, others were covered in lime, and the rest were found in an advanced state of decomposition. An anonymous call alerted the police to the abandoned vehicles, which were found by the side of a highway early in the morning on 9 May 2012. They were consequently towed to government offices to <b>unload</b> the <b>bodies.</b> The authorities confirmed that a message was left behind by the killers, presumably from Los Zetas and the Milenio Cartel. The attorney general of the state of Jalisco, Tomás Coronado Olmos, stated that this massacre was a revenge attack for the 23 killed in the 2012 Nuevo Laredo massacres. In addition, 25 people were rescued after being kidnapped in Tala, Jalisco on 8 May 2012; the killers had plans to kill and [...] "throw" [...] them for public display. Another 10 people managed to escape their capture by members of Los Zetas that same day, and alerted the local media of the situation. Upon the arrest of the four alleged killers, one of the cartel members confessed that they had plans to [...] "repeat" [...] what had happened in the 2011 Guadalajara massacre, where 26 bodies were dumped in a major avenue for public display.|$|R
40|$|Background: Body weight {{supported}} locomotor training {{was shown to}} improve walking function in neurological patients and is often performed on a treadmill. However, walking on a treadmill does not mimic natural walking for several reasons: absent self-initiation, less active retraction of leg required and altered afferent input. The superiority of overground training has been suggested in humans and was shown in rats demonstrating greater plasticity especially in descending pathways compared to treadmill training. We therefore developed a body weight support system allowing unrestricted overground walking with minimal interfering forces to train neurological patients. The present study investigated the influence of different amounts of body weight support on gait in healthy individuals. Methods: Kinematic and electromyographic data of 19 healthy individuals were recorded during overground walking {{at different levels of}} body weight support (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 %). Upper body inclination, lower body joint angles and multi-joint coordination as well as time-distance parameters were calculated. Continuous data were analyzed with regard to distinct changes within a gait cycle across all unloading conditions. Results: Temporal gait parameters were most sensitive to changes in <b>body</b> <b>unloading</b> while spatial variables (step length, joint angles) showed modest responses when unloaded by as much as 50 % body weight. The activation of the gastrocnemius muscle showed a gradual decrease with increasing unloading while the biceps femoris muscle showed increased activity levels at 50 % unloading. These changes occurred during stance phase while swing phase activity remained unaltered. Conclusions: Healthy individuals were able to keep their walking kinematics strikingly constant even when unloaded by half of their body weight, suggesting that the weight support system permits a physiological gait pattern. However, maintaining a given walking speed using close-to-normal kinematics while being unloaded was achieved by adapting muscle activity patterns. Interestingly, the required propulsion to maintain speed was not achieved by means of increased gastrocnemius activity at push-off, but rather through elevated biceps femoris activity while retracting the leg during stance phase. It remains to be investigated to what extent neurological patients with gait disorders are able to adapt their gait pattern in response to <b>body</b> <b>unloading.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Long {{duration}} spaceflight (i. e., 22 days or longer) {{has been}} associated with changes in sensorimotor systems, resulting in difficulties that astronauts experience with posture control, locomotion, and manual control. The microgravity environment is an important causal factor for spaceflight induced sensorimotor changes. Whether these sensorimotor changes may be related to structural and functional brain changes is yet unknown. However, increased intracranial pressure that by itself has been related to microgravity-induced bodily fluid shifts: [1] {{has been associated}} with white matter microstructural damage, [2] Thus, it is possible that spaceflight may affect brain structure and thereby cognitive functioning. Long duration head-down tilt bed rest has been suggested as an exclusionary analog to study microgravity effects on the sensorimotor system, [3] Bed rest mimics microgravity in <b>body</b> <b>unloading</b> and bodily fluid shifts. In consideration of the health and performance of crewmembers both in- and post-flight, we are conducting a prospective longitudinal 70 -day bed rest study as an analog to investigate the effects of microgravity on brain structure, and [4] Here we present results of the first eight subjects...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Functional Task Test {{study is}} to {{determine}} the effects of space flight on functional tests that are representative of high priority exploration mission tasks and to identify the key underlying physiological factors that contribute to decrements in performance. Ultimately this information will be used to assess performance risks and inform the design of countermeasures for exploration class missions. We are currently conducting studies on both ISS crewmembers and on subjects experiencing 70 days of 6 degrees head-down bed-rest as an analog for space flight. Bed-rest provides the opportunity for us to investigate the role of prolonged axial <b>body</b> <b>unloading</b> in isolation from the other physiological effects produced by exposure to the microgravity environment of space flight. This allows us to parse out the contribution of the <b>body</b> <b>unloading</b> component on functional performance. In this on-going study both ISS crewmembers and bed-rest subjects were tested using an interdisciplinary protocol that evaluated functional performance and related physiological changes before and after 6 months in space and 70 days of 6 head-down bed-rest, respectively. Functional tests included ladder climbing, hatch opening, jump down, manual manipulation of objects and tool use, seat egress and obstacle avoidance, recovery from a fall, and object translation tasks. Crewmembers were tested three times before flight, and on 1, 6 and 30 days after landing. Bed-rest subjects were tested three times before bed-rest and immediately after getting up from bed-rest as well as 1, 6 and 12 days after reambulation. A comparison of bed-rest and space flight data showed a significant concordance in performance changes across all functional tests. Tasks requiring a greater demand for dynamic control of postural equilibrium (i. e. fall recovery, seat egress/obstacle avoidance during walking, object translation, jump down) showed the greatest decrement in performance. Functional tests with reduced requirements for postural stability (i. e. hatch opening, ladder climb, manual manipulation of objects and tool use) showed little reduction in performance. Bed-rest results indicate that <b>body</b> support <b>unloading</b> experienced during space flight plays a central role in postflight alteration of functional task performance. These data point to the importance of providing axial body loading as a central component of an inflight training system that will integrate cardiovascular, resistance and sensorimotor adaptability training modalities into a single interdisciplinary countermeasure system...|$|R
30|$|The EURO CAREX {{study was}} a large scale, capital {{intensive}} terminal solution, requiring high volume of traffic to amortise the highly automated systems. It was efficient at volume, but inflexible in terms of demand or market changes. On the other hand, the InnovaTrain transhipment technique presented some optimistic options for austere and yet flexible terminals. In addition to the benefits discussed in previous sections, {{it should be clear}} that this technique greatly reduced the need for terminal operational staff. The loading and <b>unloading</b> of containers/swap <b>bodies,</b> for example, could be conducted by the truck driver alone. The rail vehicle was stationary for only a short transit time - opined as a pre-requisite for using a rail-intermodal service - and the truck driver’s one-to-one interaction with the cargo unit reduced the security threat to the cargo. The ability to effectively use any siding, or even the mainline, to create temporary ‘terminals’ meant that the solution added a flexibility to the rail freight sector that better suited modern logistics. However, for a rail freight service based on high volume, and therefore reducing marginal cost to very low levels, a fixed formation such as the EURO CAREX solution appeared more suitable.|$|R
40|$|Exercise and/or heat-induced {{dehydration}} {{is associated}} with decreases in plasma volume (hypovolemia) and increases in plasma osmolality (hyperosmolality), which are thought to stimulate peripheral baroreceptors and central osmoreceptors respectively. Independently, plasma hyperosmolality and baroreceptor unloading {{have been shown to}} attenuate sweating and cutaneous vasodilation during heat stress, and therefore, negatively impact body temperature regulation. However, to date little is known regarding the combined influence of plasma hyperosmolality and baroreceptor unloading on thermoefferent activity. 	Therefore, we evaluated the separate and combined effects of baroreceptor <b>unloading</b> (via lower <b>body</b> negative pressure, LBNP) and plasma hyperosmolality (via infusion of 3 % NaCl saline) on heat loss responses of sweating and cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) during progressive whole-body heating. 	We show that the combined nonthermal influences of plasma hyperosmolality and baroreceptor unloading additively delay the onset threshold for CVC, relative to their independent effects. In contrast, baroreceptor unloading has no influence on the sweating response regardless of osmotic state. These divergent roles of plasma hyperosmolality and the baroreflex on heat loss responses might serve to enhance blood pressure and body core temperature regulation during dehydration and heat stress...|$|R
40|$|Disuse-induced muscle atrophy is a {{major concern}} in aging, in neuromuscular diseases, {{post-traumatic}} injury and in microgravity life sciences affecting health and fitness also of crew members in spaceflight. By using a laboratory analogue to <b>body</b> <b>unloading</b> we perform for the first time global gene expression profiling joined to specific proteomic analysis to map molecular adaptations in disused (60 days of bed rest) human soleus muscle (CTR) and in response to a resistive exercise (RE) countermeasure protocol without and with superimposed vibration mechanosignals (RVE). Adopting Affymetrix GeneChip technology we identified 235 differently transcribed genes in the CTR group (end-vs. pre-bed rest). RE comprised 206 differentially expressed genes, whereas only 51 changed gene transcripts were found in RVE. Most gene transcription and proteomic changes were linked to various key metabolic pathways (glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, lipid metabolism) and to functional contractile structures. Gene expression profiling in bed rest identified a novel set of genes explicitly responsive to vibration mechanosignals in human soleus. This new finding highlights the efficacy of RVE protocol in reducing key signs of disuse maladaptation and atrophy, and to maintain a close-to-normal skeletal muscle quality outcome following chronic disuse in bed rest...|$|R
40|$|Body ammonia {{content of}} rainbow trout alevins was about 0. 6 mmolg 21 but {{increased}} to 4 mmolg 21 after 24 h {{of exposure to}} an external ammonia concentration of 36. 2 mmoll 21 NH 3 (15. 8 mmoll 21 ammonia) at pH 7 and 10 ˚C. During ammonia loading, the mass of alevins remained unchanged, but body ion concentrations decreased by about 28 % for Na+and Cl 2 and by 35 % for K+. These effects were reduced at lower ammonia concentrations. Exposure for 24 h to 36. 2 mm ll 21 NH 3 (15. 8 mmoll 21 ammonia) at pH 7 and 10 ˚C resulted in a build up of body ammonia that was almost complete within 10 h, whereas Na+loss from the body was delayed and commenced after about 5 h of exposure. After exposure, ammonia <b>unloading</b> from the <b>body</b> was complete in about 10 h {{but there was a}} delay of about 5 h before Na+uptake commenced. During ammonia exposure, alevins lost substantial amounts of K+(14 mm lg 21) that were not replaced for several days after exposure to ammonia.

40|$|A basic {{aspect of}} the {{neuronal}} control of quadrupedal locomotion of cat and of bipedal stance and gait of humans concerns the antigravity function of leg extensors. In humans proprioceptive reflexes involved in the maintenance of body equilibrium depend {{on the presence of}} contact forces opposing gravity. Extensor load receptors are thought to signal changes of the projection of body's centre of mass with respect to the feet. According to observations in the cat, this afferent input probably arises from Golgi tendon organs and represents a newly discovered function of these receptors in the regulation of stance and gait. From these experiments it can be concluded that during locomotion there is a closing of Ib inhibitory and an opening of Ib extensor facilitatory paths. In humans evidence for a significant contribution of load receptor contribution to the leg muscle activation came from immersion experiments. Compensatory leg muscle activation depends on the actual body weight. Also during gait the strength of leg extensor activation during the stance phase is load dependent. In patients with Parkinson's disease there is a reduced load sensitivity and decreased leg extensor activation, which might contribute to the movement disorder. Recent experiments in paraplegic patients show that the beneficial effects of a locomotor training critically depends on the initial degree of <b>body</b> <b>unloading</b> and reloading {{during the course of the}} training period. status: publishe...|$|R
