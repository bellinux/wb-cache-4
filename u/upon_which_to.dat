5|$|Edward Hack {{developed}} {{the original idea}} and model of lemon juice being contained inside lemon-shaped and coloured packaging in the 1950s. The product was then designed and produced by Cascelloid Ltd. Hack presented Cascelloid with a fresh lemon he acquired at Covent Garden, <b>upon</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> base the plastic container. Hack had performed significant searches at several markets to find an optimal model. Cascelloid stated that Hack reviewed and evaluated the entire inventory of lemons at Fortnum and Mason’s, Selfridges, Harrods and Covent Garden, the latter of which involved examining three cases of lemons that contained around 300 lemons in each case.|$|E
5|$|In early 1916, {{following}} the unsuccessful Gallipoli campaign, {{the decision was}} made to expand the size of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). At the time there were two divisions in Egypt—the 1st and 2nd—and of these, one of them (the 1st) was split up to provide a cadre <b>upon</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> raise the 4th and 5th Divisions. Around this time the decision to raise a fifth division from fresh volunteers in Australia was also made and as a result the 3rd Division was officially raised on 2 February 1916.|$|E

Jack emigrates to America, but has no money and has no job <b>upon</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> sustain himself.

When her father learns of this, he dismisses Jack and Ann says she will never marry anyone but him. Meanwhile, Lord Stanley has come to forgive his son and decided to reinstate him in his will. No sooner has the task been completed does Lord Stanley suddenly dies.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Marshall {{departed}} for Philadelphia, the temporary national capital, George Muter and Benjamin Sebastian, both justices of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, published a pamphlet stating that Marshall had perjured {{himself in a}} Court of Appeals case between himself and James Wilkinson. No known copies of the pamphlet are extant, and related surviving documents do not relate {{the exact nature of}} the charges. Marshall, being out of the state, was unable to reply immediately to the charges, and his enemies in the General Assembly drafted a memorial to the U.S. Senate requesting an investigation of the charges. On December 16, 1795, the memorial was approved by the General Assembly and transmitted to the Senate. The Senate appointed a committee to recommend action on the memorial, and the committee found that the charges against Marshall were not specific, that the authors had provided no evidence <b>upon</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the charges, that no one was empowered to prosecute the charges in the Senate, and that further action by the Senate was inappropriate. On March 22, 1796, the Senate approved the committee's report by a vote of 168. Muter and Sebastian never filed formal charges against Marshall for perjury.|$|E

25|$|Disinvestment {{campaigns have}} {{been focused on}} {{high-profile}} organizations with large financial holdings such as heavily endowed universities or churches and municipalities managing large portfolios of retirement fund investments. Such high-profile institutions, like Harvard University or the multimillion-member Presbyterian and Methodist Churches, provided divestment proponents a platform from which to spotlight their political activity. In addition, the wide financial holdings of these institutions generally provided divestment campaigns a list of stocks <b>upon</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> base their calls for divestment.|$|E

25|$|BUA's {{advocacy}} of large-scale route transfers from the corporations {{had not been}} envisaged by the committee and was opposed by the corporations and trade unions.

If both execute the same swerving maneuver they will manage to pass each other, but if they choose differing maneuvers they will collide. In the payoff matrix in Fig. 2, successful passing is represented by a payoff of 10, and a collision by a payoff of 0.|$|E

25|$|It was in {{the spring}} of 378 CE that Mavia {{launched}} the massive revolt against the central government, often compared to that launched by Zenobia a century earlier. Her forces, which she often led personally, swept into Arabia and Palestine and reached the edges of Egypt, defeating the armies of Rome many times. Because she and the Tanukhids had left Aleppo to use the desert as their base, the Romans were left without a standing target <b>upon</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> inflict retribution. Mavia's highly mobile units, using classic guerilla warfare tactics, conducted numerous raids and frustrated Roman attempts to subdue the revolt.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, {{as a result of}} the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, the decision was made to raise an all volunteer force, known as the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), for service overseas. The result of this decision was that the Militia units that already existed lost some of their best personnel who were used to form a cadre of trained men <b>upon</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> raise the units of the 2nd AIF, while the units themselves were relegated to administering the training of conscripts that were called up following the reinstitution of the compulsory training scheme in January 1940.|$|E

25|$|In a 10th-century Life of Saint Giles, {{written for}} the benefit of pilgrims, a legend is {{recorded}} about how, one day, when King Wamba (also known as Flavius) was out hunting in the forest between Arles and Nîmes in Provence, he began to pursue a hind (deer). The animal fled, seeking refuge in the cave where Giles the hermit was quietly praying. (In some versions of the story, the hind, provided by God, was Giles' sole companion and sustained him on its milk.) Wamba shot his arrow into the opening. But he missed the hind, striking Giles instead, wounding him in the leg and causing a permanent disability. The king's hunting dogs then rushed in for the kill. But when Wamba arrived he found his dogs miraculously rooted to the spot. Discovering what he had done, he begged forgiveness and tried to make amends. But Giles continued his prayers, refusing all help or recompense. The king nonetheless had doctors care for the wound. He also offered Giles the land <b>upon</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> build a monastery. But Giles refused.|$|E
