40|$|A brief {{survey of}} the angle-scanned photoemission {{technique}} is given. It incorporates two complementary methods in one: 1. Mapping of X-ray excited photoelectron intensities over virtually the complete hemisphere above the sample surface results in extended data sets where important surface-geometrical structure information is extracted and even “fingerprinting” is possible. This method {{is known as the}} very powerful angle-scanned X-ray photoelectron diffraction. 2. Mapping <b>ultraviolet-excited</b> <b>photoelectron</b> intensities as a function of emission angles gives the possibility to do band mapping as well as to study the Fermi surface of single crystals very directly. Therefore, by switching between X-rays and ultraviolet-photons, it is possible to study the geometrical and electronic structure within the same experiment...|$|R

40|$|Graphene is a {{material}} with unique properties, which attract {{a lot of}} interest and offer technologically advanced features. In master’s thesis I present graphene and its properties, describe the crystal structure and show the theoretical calculation of the dispersion relation of energy bands in graphene, using the tight binding method. In the following chapter I present the experimental methods which I have exploited to perform the measurements – helium atom scattering (HAS), X-ray <b>photoelectron</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (XPS), ultraviolet <b>photoelectron</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (UPS) and angle resolved ultraviolet <b>photoelectron</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (ARUPS). In the experimental part, I present the formation of graphene films on the surface Ni(111), which I have created by chemical vapor deposition of ethylene. By X-ray <b>photoelectron</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> measurements, I have determined the type of produced graphene film and distinguished different graphene phases (epitaxial and rotated) from the carbide phase. I have found that the temperature of the sample and the concentration of dissolved carbon in the substrate (this is associated with the pressure and the time of ethylene dosing) play crucial role on the type of the graphene phase formed on Ni(111). Using helium atom scattering I have measured surface roughness during ethylene dosing. Measurements have shown that the carbide phase is more ordered than graphene phases. By using ultraviolet <b>photoelectron</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> and angle-resolved ultraviolet <b>photoelectron</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> I have determined the structure and dispersion of the valence band. In the case of the bi-layer graphene, I observed the shift of the π-states towards lower binding energies, showing that the rotated phase in bi-layer graphene couples with Ni(111) surface weaker than epitaxial graphene. I have made a comparison of the dispersion relation for the epitaxial graphene on the Ni(111) and the bi-layer graphene on the surface of nickel. Measurements are in good agreement with theoretical calculation of dispersion, showing energy gap for epitaxial graphene (2, 4 eV) and gapless bi-layer graphene...|$|R
