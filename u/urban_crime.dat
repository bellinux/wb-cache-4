40|$|Urbanization {{has created}} {{numerous}} social problems, among which is crime {{that became a}} common phenomenon to all urban areas in both developed and developing nations. Recent unimaginable levels of the world urbanization coincides with rise in <b>urban</b> <b>crimes</b> {{in many parts of}} the world, as the rate of unemployment had been on the increase and coupled with increased poverty among the urban poor. Nature of crime is not uniform but varies from one geographical region to another. In some areas, property crime is more common while in others, crime on person (violent) is prevalent. Crime is not being plagued by a singular factor anywhere it occurred, there are variant factors that influence criminal activities. However, key factors that persuade criminal behaviours of potential offenders includes: unemployment, poverty, bad governance and weaknesses in law enforcement or crime-control agencies. These four key factors were discussed in this paper with hope of bringing out nature of <b>urban</b> <b>crimes</b> that bedevilled properties and people safety for taking management and prevention measures...|$|R

The film, starring Dev Anand, Geeta Bali and Kalpana Kartik was a trendsetter, regarded as the forerunner of the spate of <b>urban</b> <b>crime</b> films that followed in Bollywood in the 1950s. The film Baazi saw the debut of Kalpana Kartik (aka Mona Singha) as the lead female actress and Guru Dutt as a director. The collaboration was a success {{at the box office}} and the duo of Dev Anand and Kalpana Kartik were offered many films to star in together. They signed all the film offers and subsequently the movies Aandhiyan (1952), Taxi Driver (1954), House No. 44 (1955) and Nau Do Gyarah (1957) went on to become big hits too. During the making of the film Taxi Driver, the couple fell in love and Dev proposed marriage to his heroine Kalpana. In 1954, Taxi Driver was declared a hit and the two decided to marry in a quiet ceremony. The couple had a son, Suneil Anand in 1956 and later a daughter, Devina, was born.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s America was still {{primarily}} a rural country, especially {{in terms of}} self-identity. D. W. Griffith’s 1912 film The Musketeers of Pig Alley is one of the earliest American films to feature urban organized crime. Prohibition's arrival in 1920 created an environment where anyone who wanted to drink had to interact with criminals, especially in urban areas. Nonetheless, the <b>urban</b> <b>crime</b> genre was ignored until 1927 when the film Underworld, which is recognized as the first gangster movie, became a surprise hit. According to the Encyclopedia of Hollywoods entry on Underworld, [...] "The film established the fundamental elements of the gangster movie: a hoodlum hero; ominous, night-shrouded city streets; floozies; and a blazing finale in which the cops cut down the protagonist." [...] Other gangster films such as Thunderbolt, Lights of New York, The Racket, and Doorway to Hell were released to capitalize on Underworld's popularity, with Thunderbolt later described as [...] "a virtual remake" [...] of the film. Motivated by financial gain in an increasingly competitive film market, and motivated by the fact that provocative pictures sold tickets, these movies pushed the boundaries of film violence. Other late 1920s crime films depicted organized crime on Broadway, and investigated the connection between mobsters and Broadway productions in films such as 1929's Tenderloin and Broadway.|$|E

Computational criminology has been pioneered in the field of environmental criminology. Liu and Eck (2008) describe artificial crime analyses and simulation as methods to reveal hidden processes of <b>urban</b> <b>crimes</b> by combining criminology, computer simulation, and geographic information systems [1]. Two other prominent researchers in this area, Patricia and Paul Brantingham, have focused their research on environmental or contextual factors that can influence criminal activity. Their research initiated the development of the Computational Criminology Initiative (CCI), which allows for new visualization techniques for understanding crime patterns.|$|R

It {{is quite}} consensual that police patrolling can be {{regarded}} as one of the best well-known practices for implementing public-safety preventive policies towards the combat of an assortment of <b>urban</b> <b>crimes.</b> However, the specification of successful police patrol routes is by no means a trivial task to pursue, mainly when one considers large demographic areas. In this work, we present the first results achieved with GAPatrol, a novel evolutionary multiagent-based simulation tool devised to assist police managers in the design of effective police patrol route strategies. One particular aspect investigated here relates to the GAPatrol’s facility to automatically discover crime hotspots, that is, highcrime-density regions (or targets) that deserve to be better covered by routine patrol surveillance. In order to testify the potentialities of the novel approach in such regard, simulation results related to two scenarios of study over the same artificial urban territory are presented and discussed here. ...|$|R

[...] Over time, more and more personal, social and religious/moral problems would be blamed on alcohol. And not only would it be enough to prevent drunkenness; any consumption of alcohol would come to be seen as unacceptable. Groups that began by promoting the moderate use of alcohol instead of its abuse- would ultimately form temperance movements and press for the complete and total prohibition of the production and distribution of beverage alcohol. Unfortunately, this would not eliminate social problems but would compound the situation by creating additional problems wherever it was implemented.|$|E

2500|$|In 1873, {{the house}} of Beadle & Adams {{introduced}} a new ten-cent format, , with only 32 pages and a black-and-white illustration on the cover, under the title New and Old Friends. It was not a success, but the format was so much cheaper to produce that they tried again in 1877 with The Fireside Library and Frank Starr's New York Library. The first reprinted English love stories, the second contained hardier material, but both titles caught on. Publishers were no less eager to follow a new trend then than now. Soon the newsstands were flooded by ten-cent weekly [...] "libraries". These publications also varied in size, from as small as 7 x 10inches (The Boy's Star Library is an example) to 8.5 x 12 (New York Detective Library). The Old Cap Collier Library was issued in both sizes and also in booklet form. Each issue tended to feature a single story, unlike the story papers, {{and many of them}} were devoted to a single character.

One of the most successful titles, Frank Tousey's New York Detective Library eventually came to alternate stories of the James Gang with stories of Old King Brady, detective, and (in a rare occurrence in the dime novel) several stories which featured both, with Old King Brady doggedly on the trail of the vicious gang.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} {{afternoon}} of December 22, 1984, Bernhard Goetz shot four young African American men from the Bronx on a New York City Subway train; the incident got nationwide media coverage. That day, the men—Barry Allen, Troy Canty, Darrell Cabey (all 19), and James Ramseur (18)—boarded a downtown [...] train (Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line express) carrying screwdrivers, apparently {{on a mission to}} steal money from video arcade machines in Manhattan. When the train arrived at the 14th Street station in Manhattan, 15 to 20 other passengers remained with them in R22 subway car 7657, the seventh car of the ten-car train. At the 14th Street station, Goetz entered the car through the rearmost door, crossed the aisle, and took a seat on the long bench across from the door. After Canty asked Goetz how he was, Goetz replied affirmatively, at which point the four boys supposedly moved over to the left of Goetz, blocking Goetz off from the other passengers in the car. They then asked Goetz for money. He fired five shots, seriously wounding all four men. Nine days later he surrendered to police and was eventually charged with attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment, and several firearms offenses. A jury found him not guilty of all charges except for one count of carrying an unlicensed firearm, for which he served eight months of a one-year sentence. The incident sparked a nationwide debate on race and crime in major cities, the legal limits of self-defense, {{and the extent to which}} the citizenry could rely on the police to secure their safety.

Results:At the macro level, analyses suggest that incidents of pirate attacks are concentrated in five subregions of the earth’s oceans and that the time series for these different subregions differ. At the micro level, analyses suggest {{that for the last}} 16 years (or more), pirate attacks appear to cluster in space and time suggesting that patterns are not static but are also not random. Conclusions: Much like other types of crime, pirate attacks cluster in space, and following an attack at one location the riskof others at the same locationornearby is temporarily elevated. The identification of such regularities has implications for the understanding of maritime piracy and for predicting the future locations of attacks...|$|R
