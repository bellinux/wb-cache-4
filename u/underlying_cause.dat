5|$|Pneumonia is {{typically}} diagnosed {{based on a}} combination of physical signs and a chest X-ray. However, the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial origin.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} goitre are {{associated}} with pain, whereas many do not cause any symptoms. Enlarged goitres may extend beyond the normal position of the thyroid gland to below the sternum, around the airway or esophagus.

Thyroid function tests may be done to investigate the cause and effects of the goitre. The <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of the goitre may be treated, however many goitres with no associated symptoms are simply monitored.|$|E

5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of hypopituitarism vary, depending on which hormones are undersecreted and on the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of the abnormality. The diagnosis of hypopituitarism is made by blood tests, but often specific scans and other investigations are needed to find the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause,</b> such as tumors of the pituitary, and the ideal treatment. Most hormones controlled by the secretions of the pituitary can be replaced by tablets or injections. Hypopituitarism is a rare disease, but may be significantly underdiagnosed in people with previous traumatic brain injury. The first description of the condition was made in 1914 by the German physician Dr Morris Simmonds.|$|E
5|$|In hepatic {{encephalopathy}} type C, {{the identification and}} treatment of alternative or underlying causes {{is central to the}} initial management. Given the frequency of infection as the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause,</b> antibiotics are often administered empirically (without knowledge of the exact source and nature of the infection). Once an episode of encephalopathy has been effectively treated, a decision may need to be made on whether to prepare for a liver transplant.|$|E
5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} {{often have}} no or only mild symptoms. Numerous symptoms and signs {{are associated with}} hypothyroidism, and {{can be related to}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause,</b> or a direct effect of having not enough thyroid hormones.

5|$|SAH {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a head injury or spontaneously, usually from a {{ruptured}} cerebral aneurysm. Risk factors for spontaneous cases included high blood pressure, smoking, family history, alcoholism, and cocaine use. Generally, the diagnosis can be determined by a CT scan of the head if done within six hours. Occasionally a lumbar puncture is also required. After confirmation further tests are usually performed to determine the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the lungs can also be affected by compression from fluid in the pleural cavity pleural effusion, or other substances such as air (pneumothorax), blood (hemothorax), or rarer causes. These may be investigated using a chest X-ray or CT scan, and may require the insertion of a surgical drain until the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> is identified and treated.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{depends on}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> and whether any complications occur. Rhabdomyolysis complicated by acute kidney impairment in patients with traumatic injury may have a mortality rate of 20%. Admission to {{the intensive care unit}} is associated with a mortality of 22% in the absence of acute kidney injury, and 59% if kidney impairment occurs. Most people who have sustained kidney impairment due to rhabdomyolysis fully recover their kidney function.|$|E
40|$|MARS is {{the system}} {{established}} and maintained by the European Commission in order to collect information related to major industrial accidents in EU Member States {{in the context of}} the Seveso II Directive. One of the main purposes of the MARS database is to provide information for learning from the accidents to avoid similar events. Probably, the most important issue for the learning is the determination of the <b>causes,</b> particularly the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes,</b> of the accidents. One objective was to find possible patterns of <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> per industry type and per country. Another objective was to determine the occurrence of weaknesses in safety management systems and in safety culture as <b>underlying</b> <b>causes.</b> A further objective was to determine the level of learning from the accidents, as it appears from the reports, per industry type and per country. A sequential method, presented by us in a previous paper in this publication, was used to make it possible to go beyond the causes given in the original reports and to find more <b>underlying</b> <b>causes.</b> To determine the level of learning from the accidents, using the actions/lessons learned given in the reports, a classification method was developed. This method establishes the level of learning of the lessons learned from each case description, essentially from the organisational point of view. This paper presents the results of an analysis regarding <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> of all the accidents of the MARS database reported up to mid 2007. The results are expressed per industry type and per country. The main results are that as much as three times as many <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> can be found when applying the method developed compared with what is given in the original reports. The most important <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> are found in weaknesses in process analysis (risk assessment) and in procedures, regardless of industry type. Weaknesses in safety management systems and in safety culture contribute as <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> in a very high percentage of the accidents. The quality of reporting, measured in terms of analysis of <b>underlying</b> <b>causes,</b> vary considerably between various countries. The level of learning, as determined from the information in the reports, is found to be in general rather low, especially from some of the countries. This study has given rise to ideas of improvement of the MARS system. It has also raised many questions, some of which would be suitable for further research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|Treatment is with {{anticoagulants}} (medication that suppresses blood clotting), {{and rarely}} thrombolysis (enzymatic {{destruction of the}} blood clot). Given that there is usually an <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> for the disease, tests may be performed to look for these. The disease may be complicated by raised intracranial pressure, which may warrant surgical intervention such as the placement of a shunt.|$|E
5|$|Vaccines {{to prevent}} {{certain types of}} {{pneumonia}} are available. Other methods of prevention include handwashing and not smoking.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{methodology}} for diagnosing the original source and <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> of power system disturbances, where {{voltage and current}} recordings from different locations of a power system are collected. In the proposed method, disturbances are first pre-classified {{based on the number}} of transition segments. The spatial zone of the source of disturbances is coarsely determined from voltage recordings only. Disturbances are then further analyzed and characterized by extracting information from both voltages and currents. Finally more accurate information about the location of the source of disturbances is obtained by different techniques depending on the type of disturbances. Several <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> are analyzed and classified by using the proposed features extracted from both voltage and current waveforms. Finally, the location of the source of disturbances is refined once the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> are found. Case studies were performed on a large grid-connected wind farm with disturbances from several <b>underlying</b> <b>causes,</b> including: fault, unit tripping, transformer, capacitor, and cable energizing generated by PSCAD/EMTDC...|$|R

5|$|Epilepsy is a {{group of}} {{neurological}} disorders characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and as a rule, have no immediate <b>underlying</b> <b>cause.</b> Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition.|$|E
5|$|If one {{of these}} tests shows a {{deficiency}} of hormones produced by the pituitary, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary {{is the first step}} in identifying an <b>underlying</b> <b>cause.</b> MRI may show various tumors and may assist in delineating other causes. Tumors smaller than 1cm are referred to as microadenomas, and larger lesions are called macroadenomas. Computed tomography with radiocontrast may be used if MRI is not available. Formal visual field testing by perimetry is recommended, as this would show evidence of optic nerve compression by a tumor.|$|E
5|$|If the TSH {{level is}} normal or low and serum free T4 levels are low, this is suggestive of central {{hypothyroidism}} (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus).

There might also be symptoms of a pituitary mass such as headaches and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|E
