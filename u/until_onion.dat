50|$|In 1851, Fanno married Rebecca Denney, and {{the first}} of their six {{children}} was born later that year. In 1859, he designed and built a rural home in the modified New England revival style popular in Oregon at the time. The family pioneered the cultivation of onions in Oregon, and by the 1890s these became regionally recognized for their high quality. Fanno descendants produced onions on the farm <b>until</b> <b>onion</b> maggots drove {{them out of business}} in the 1940s. Members of the family occupied the farmhouse until 1974, and in March 1982 they donated the house and adjacent land to the Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District (THPRD).|$|E
40|$|Water is {{a limited}} {{resource}} for crop production in arid areas of Southern New Mexico. The objectives {{of this study were}} to estimate the amount and depth of water and nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N) fronts, water and NO 3 -N balances, and irrigation efficiencies for two onion (Allium cepa L.) fields under furrow and drip irrigation systems. Monthly soil samples were analyzed for NO 3 -N and chloride concentration for two onion growing seasons starting September 2006 to August 2009. The average amount of NO 3 -N in the soil water estimated by chloride tracer technique varied from 97. 4 to 105. 2 [*]mg[*]L- 1 for furrow and 65. 2 to 66. 8 [*]mg[*]L- 1 for drip-irrigated fields for the 60 - to 200 -cm depth. The NO 3 -N loadings below the rooting zone ranged from 145 to 150 [*]kg[*]ha- 1 for furrow- and 76 to 79 [*]kg[*]ha- 1 for drip-irrigated fields. The irrigation efficiencies varied from 78 to 80 % for furrow- and 83 % for drip- and N application efficiencies (NAEs) were 35 to 36 % for furrow- and 38 to 39 % for drip-irrigated fields. Small N fertilizer applications, delayed <b>until</b> <b>onion</b> bulbing starts, and water applications, preferably through drip irrigation, are recommended to reduce deep percolation and increase nitrogen and water efficiencies...|$|E

50|$|The {{potatoes}} are boiled, mashed coarsely and kept aside. Vegetable oil is heated {{in a pan}} and ingredients like asafoetida, mustard seeds, chillies, onions, curry leaves are added and fried {{for a couple of}} minutes <b>until</b> the <b>onions</b> are translucent. Ginger-garlic paste, turmeric and salt are then added and fried for a few seconds, after which the mashed {{potatoes are}} added to the mixture and cooked for a few more minutes.|$|R
5000|$|Irachi pathiri or Irachi pathil is {{very popular}} in North Malabar and is a very common snack in areas of Thalassery, Vatakara and Malappuram. It {{is made in the}} same way as a samosa, but the only {{difference}} is that the outer skin in which the masala is stuffed is made of wheat flour. In some places all-purpose flour is used for the skin. It is made by stuffing a masala made of cooked chicken or meat, which is shredded to very small pieces using bare hands and then adding onion, green chillies, garlic turmeric and a little chili powder and heating <b>until</b> <b>onions</b> are brown in very little ghee over a medium flame, then stuffing in the already prepared skin and frying in oil. It is the size of the samosas which are common in Northern India. Unlike samosas though, the skins are not roasted. It is a main item on the Iftar menu in the Malabar area, along with other items such as unnakkayi [...] and Chatti Pathiri.|$|R

50|$|Cooked {{leftovers}} from a roast meal can be used. However, to make fresh rumbledethumps {{one needs}} to lightly sauté the shredded onion and cabbage in butter <b>until</b> the <b>onion</b> is translucent and the cabbage wilted, then add some potatoes mashed with butter, salt and pepper; after thoroughly mixing the ingredients, they are placed into an oven proof dish, and cheddar (or similar) cheese placed on top, if desired. This is then baked until golden brown on top.|$|R
50|$|Boliche (pronounced bo'litʃe, {{also called}} boliche mechado) is a Cuban pot roast dish {{consisting}} of eye round beef roast stuffed with ham browned {{in olive oil}} simmered in water with <b>onions</b> <b>until</b> the meat is soft, and then quartered potatoes added. Additional ingredients can include green peppers and various spices such as coriander, oregano and bay leaf, and salt and pepper.|$|R
5000|$|Bracketing {{may also}} be {{understood}} in terms of the phenomenological activity it is supposed to make possible: the [...] "unpacking" [...] of phenomena, or, in other words, systematically peeling away their symbolic meanings like layers of an <b>onion</b> <b>until</b> only the thing itself as meant and experienced remains. Thus, one's subjective intending of the bracketed phenomenon is examined and analyzed in phenomenological purity.|$|R

50|$|The dish is {{traditionally}} prepared by first frying chicken drumsticks or thighs. Afterwards, water {{is mixed with}} the cooking oil, tomato sauce, flour, garlic and <b>onions</b> <b>until</b> the sauce reaches a boiling point, {{at which point the}} chicken is added and left to boil for another fifteen minutes, or until the sauce gains a thick consistency. Before serving, parsley is sprinkled on top. Mămăligă (polenta) is typically used as a side dish, together with a light salad.|$|R
40|$|DCPA was the {{principal}} preemergence herbicide for controlling weeds in <b>onions</b> <b>until</b> its manufacture was discontinued in 1996, {{although it may be}} reintroduced in 2001. The purpose of this research was to test the effectiveness of a combination of two herbicides, bensulide and pendimethalin, as a replacement weed-control treatment. Results are encouraging; this combination performed as well as DCPA in 12 onion field trials conducted in the Imperial Valley. Onion yields in fields treated with bensulide and pendimethalin were comparable to that of fields treated with DCPA...|$|R
50|$|Many various {{ingredients}} {{may be used}} in preparations of onion sauce, such as cream, milk, butter, chicken broth, wine, port wine, beer, lemon juice, flour, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, nutmeg, dry mustard, {{sage and}} other herbs, mushroom ketchup, bread crumbs, bacon and others. Preparation generally involves slicing or dicing and then cooking the onions, adding additional ingredients, and then continuing to cook or simmer the mixture to create a sauce. Some preparations involve frying the <b>onions</b> <b>until</b> they are browned, while others do not brown the onions.|$|R
60|$|A continual {{source of}} {{amusement}} to us were the acts and doings of Mrs. Aleshine {{and her three}} sailor men. These bold mariners had enlisted, soul and body, into {{the service of the}} thrifty housewife; and as it was impossible to do anything in connection with the growing of the <b>onions</b> <b>until</b> the desired fields should be acquired and the spring should open, many and diverse were the labors at which the coxswain and those two able-bodied seamen, Bill and Jim, set themselves, or were set by Mrs. Aleshine.|$|R
