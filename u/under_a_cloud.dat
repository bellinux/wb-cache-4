5|$|In 1934, Bill Woodfull led Australia back to England on a {{tour that}} had been <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> after the tempestuous cricket {{diplomacy}} of the previous bodyline series. Jardine had retired from International cricket in early 1934 after captaining a fraught tour of India and under England's new captain, Bob Wyatt, agreements {{were put in place}} so that bodyline would not be used. However, there were occasions when the Australians felt that their hosts had crossed the mark with tactics resembling bodyline.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{planners}} {{proposed that}} small boats, towing large radar reflecting balloons (code named Filbert) and carrying both Moonshine jamming and standard wireless equipment (for transmitting fake traffic), would advance toward the French coast <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> of Window. The chaff and other countermeasures would hide {{the small size}} of the naval force while wireless traffic would play on the FUSAG story to mislead the Germans into expecting a major landing. A third deceptive force, Operation Big Drum, would use radar countermeasures on the western flank of the true invasion fleet. This operation was intended to lend confusion as to the extent of the landings in Normandy.|$|E

5|$|In late August 1861, General John C. Frémont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without {{consulting}} his superiors in Washington, a proclamation {{of martial law}} in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal. After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.|$|E
5|$|The first match began <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> of Grace-inspired {{controversy}} on Thursday, 20 June at The Oval, where Gloucestershire {{were beaten}} by 16 runs. Surrey made 150 (Grace 4–43) and 136 (Grace 6–70), but Gloucestershire's response was 111 (Grace 40) and 159 (Grace 31). This {{was a fine}} all-round performance by Grace, though {{he would not have}} been happy with two more innings under 50, and it serves to illustrate just how much Gloucestershire depended on him. The next match at Hove began the following Monday, 24 June, and Gloucestershire won by an innings and 67 runs after losing the toss and being asked to field. Sussex were all out for 93 (Grace 0–21) and 71 (Grace 4–13); in between, Gloucestershire made 231 despite Grace scoring a duck. His brothers did the batting in this one, Fred scoring 71 and E. M. 53.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the regular}} season success, the team entered the playoffs <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud.</b> In February, Hasek had {{suffered}} an adductor muscle injury while playing for the Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team during the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. He had played only one game for the Czechs and returned to Ottawa to heal, but would never play for the Senators again. Rookie goaltender Ray Emery had {{to take over the}} starting goaltender duties, leading the media to predict an early playoff exit due to Hasek's absence. Hopes were raised in the first round, however, when Emery would become the first rookie goaltender since Philadelphia's Brian Boucher in 2000 to win a playoff series when the Senators defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning four games to one. However, the Senators then lost to the Buffalo Sabres in the second round, a series in which all games were decided by one goal.|$|E

5|$|The {{convergence}} {{of the two}} columns on the French at Ostrach demonstrated {{the advantage of the}} superiority of Austrian numbers. From every angle, the Austrians threatened to overwhelm the French. Jourdan wrote that his men disappeared <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> of red coats. Battalion after battalion of Austrians threw themselves against the French defenses. By late morning, Charles' troops pushed the French out of Hoßkirch, and into Ostrach, which the French nearly lost until Jourdan sent reinforcements. The fighting remained fierce until about 1600, when the French pulled back toward Pfullendorf, encouraged by Austrian cavalry. Once out of Ostrach, and established on the road at and around Pfullendorf, the French formed a new perimeter, reinforced by reserves of Soulham, and enjoyed the benefit of altitude from which they could fire down upon the attacking Austrians. Despite the punishing musket fire, Charles' strategy worked. The far right wing (Ferino's force), which had not been attacked yet, fell back to Salem Abbey, to maintain communication with the French center.|$|E

He also compiled a 135–44 (.754) overall record. Brown left <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud,</b> as NCAA sanctions and a postseason probation were levied against Kansas following Brown's departure in the 1988–1989 season {{as a result of}} recruiting violations that took place during Brown's tenure.

25|$|He was {{recalled}} in November 2005 following the injury to Shane Watson, as Australia's {{search for an}} all-rounder continued. After five Tests, with a batting average of 12.62 and a bowling average of 85.00, his position in the team was <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> until the 2005 Boxing Day Test. On {{the first day of}} the match, he was out caught behind for a golden duck. Then, with his batting average threatening to drop under 10 and bowling average pushing 100, Symonds took 3/50 in the South African first innings before blasting 72 off 54 balls in the second innings (including a new Australian record for the fastest Test fifty—40 balls) and taking 2/6.|$|E
25|$|During the mid-1980s, when Hainan Island {{was still}} part of Guangdong Province, a fourteen-month episode of {{marketing}} zeal by Hainan Special District Administrator Lei Yu put Hainan's pursuit of provincial status <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud.</b> It involved the duty-free imports from Hong Kong of 90,000 Japanese-made cars and trucks {{at a cost of}} ¥4.5 billion (US$1.5 billion), and exporting them – with the help of local naval units – to the mainland, making 150% profits. By comparison, only 10,000 vehicles were imported into Hainan since 1950. In addition, it involved further consignments of 2.9 million TV sets, 252,000 videocassette recorders & 122,000 motorcycles. The money was taken from the 1983 central government funds destined for the construction of the island's transportation infrastructure (roads, railways, airports, harbours) over the next ten years.|$|E

25|$|When Simon Snyder {{followed}} McKean {{as governor}} of Pennsylvania, he fired Ellicott in 1809 due to political differences. A prominent supporter of Snyder was former General in Chief James Wilkinson, {{one of the four}} generals that Ellicott had denounced eleven years earlier and had come <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> of treason, along with Vice President Aaron Burr. Ellicott returned to private practice and was hired in February 1811 by David B. Mitchell, then governor of Georgia, to re-survey the border between Georgia and North Carolina to settle a border dispute between these two states. Although he started out in July, his expedition was delayed and had to work throughout the hard winter. Ellicott confirmed earlier findings that the border, which was supposed to follow latitude 35°N, was several miles further south than the Georgians claimed. His report was not well received by the Georgian administration, who furthermore refused to pay his fees. Ellicott returned in July 1812 to Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|Despite departing <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud,</b> Lamont {{defends his}} budget record to this day. The 1991 budget, {{in which he}} seized the {{opportunity}} presented by Thatcher's resignation to restrict mortgage interest tax relief to the basic rate of income tax and also cut the rate of corporation tax by two percentage points, was greeted by positive coverage in The Economist which dubbed him a Nimble Novice. In the 1992 budget his proposal to advance to a 20% basic rate of income tax {{through a combination of}} a narrow initial band, a cut in tax on deposit interest and curtailment of tax allowances was hailed as an elegant way of combining populism with progressivism, though events were later to lend support to Nigel Lawson's view that this approach was strategically inept. His final budget in 1993 was more sympathetically received by financial specialists than John Major's 1990 budget or Kenneth Clarke's budget of November 1993. Lamont attributes the large public sector borrowing requirement (i.e. fiscal deficit) of these years to the depth of the recession triggered by his inability to cut interest rates sooner within the ERM.|$|E
25|$|Seeing {{from the}} city that the siege {{had not yet been}} {{properly}} organized, the defenders decided to send three hundred men on horseback and a thousand on foot against the Master of Santiago, Juan Alonso Pérez de Guzmán y Coronel, Pero Ponce de León and the Seville Council in the Puerta del Fonsario. The men of the Count of Lous counterattacked. They did not wait for the other Christians, and the Count and his men died <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> of arrows when they came too close to the wall. After the king had seen the damage that could be done, {{in the next few days}} he had a trench dug around the Villa Vieja from the Río de la Miel to the sea to prevent attacks {{from the city}}. Shelters were built next to the trenches and soldiers were posted at regular intervals to stand guard at night. The king moved his headquarters closer to the city and sent several of his men conquer the Cartagena Tower in the city of Carteia, from where they could observe the movements of the Merinids of Gibraltar.|$|E
