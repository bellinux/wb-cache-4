Intelligent products, composed of an intelligent agent and an intelligent being, focuses on the suitability for integration. Intelligent products are robust towards disturbances or in general <b>unreliabilities.</b> However, intelligent products don`t provide explicit support for dealing with <b>unreliabilities.</b> Taking decisions in an unreliable environment requires a trust relationship between the different entities.

5|$|Seen {{as likely}} to provoke {{controversy}} even before its publication, Sexual Preference received considerable media attention, and reviews that were mainly mixed or negative. Critics questioned Bell et al.′s reliance upon a statistical technique, originally developed {{for use in the}} biological sciences, called path analysis, disputed the representativeness of their sample of homosexuals, pointed out the difficulty and potential <b>unreliability</b> of adult recall of childhood feeling and the vague and general nature of the questions respondents were asked, and disagreed with Bell et al.′s suggestion that sexual orientation is innate. Nevertheless, some reviewers complimented Sexual Preference for its authors' challenge to established views about the causes of homosexuality, and it eventually came to be considered a classic work. It {{is one of the most}} frequently cited retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation, credited by psychologists with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality.

40|$|A {{teleoperation}} {{system allows}} the human to manipulate in remote/inaccessible/dangerous or scaled environments. From a control point of view, the haptic control loop, where motion and force data are exchanged between the master and the slave manipulator, is very challenging {{as it is}} closed over a communication network, e. g. the Internet. The communication network introduces <b>unreliabilities</b> such as (time-varying) time delay and packet loss, which are not only distorting the human haptic perception of the remote environment but can destabilize the overall system. In recent years control approaches based on the passivity framework and the scattering transformation have been developed in order to stabilize the teleoperation system {{in the presence of}} such communication <b>unreliabilities,</b> see e. g. [1, 2]. The major reason for the success of the passivity formalism in teleoperation is that it can cope with the largely unknown, nonlinear and time-varying human arm and environment dynamics, which, however, can assumed to be passive. The scattering transformation transforms passive systems into finite gain L 2 -stable systems with a L 2 gain γ ≤ 1 and guarantees the finite gain L 2 -stability of the overall teleoperation system for all communication network operators that are small gain, e. g. constant time delay but also appropriately handled packet loss [2]. However, the passivity framework is known to be conservative resulting in...|$|R
5|$|In late 908 Eustathios Argyros was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} magistros—the highest court dignity open to someone {{not a member of the}} imperial family—and the post of Drungary of the Watch, i.e. commander of the imperial bodyguard, and replaced as strategos of Charsianon by Constantine Doukas. About a year later, he fell again under Leo's suspicion, and was ordered to return to his family's estates at Charsianon. Again the reason is unknown; perhaps, according to Cheynet and Vannier, it was a result of the <b>unreliability</b> of the Armenian lords he had welcomed into the Empire, who frequently went over to the Arabs. On the way, he died after taking poison by one of his servants, and was buried on Spynin, the summit of Mount Aran. While historian Romilly James Heald Jenkins has suggested that Argyros' poisoning was done through an agent of the powerful and scheming court eunuch Samonas, it more likely was suicide. His two sons, Pothos and Leo, who served in the palace as manglabites (personal bodyguards of the emperor), arranged to have their father's body transferred for burial to the monastery of Saint Elizabeth in the Charsianon district, founded by Eustathios' father.|$|E
5|$|While rival teams Lotus and McLaren {{relied on}} the Cosworth DFV engine from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, Ecclestone sought a {{competitive}} advantage by investigating other options. Despite the success of Murray's Cosworth-powered cars, Ecclestone signed a deal with Italian motor manufacturer Alfa Romeo to use their large and powerful flat-12 engine from the 1976 season. The engines were free, but they rendered the new BT45s, now in red Martini Racing livery, unreliable and overweight. The 1976 and 1977 seasons saw Brabham fall {{toward the back of}} the field again. Reutemann negotiated a release from his contract before the end of the 1976 season and signed with Ferrari. Ulsterman John Watson replaced him at Brabham for 1977. Watson lost near certain victory in the French Grand Prix (Dijon) of that year when his car ran low on fuel on the last lap and was passed by Mario Andretti's Lotus, with Watson's second place being the team's best result of the season. The car often showed at the head of races, but the <b>unreliability</b> of the Alfa Romeo engine was a major problem. The team lost Pace early in the 1977 season when he died in a light aircraft accident.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Ba Cụt was {{involved}} in a battle with another Hòa Hảo leader, Nguyễn Giác Ngộ. He was defeated and driven from the district of Chợ Mới in February, provoking Soái to attack Ngo. Ba Cụt then moved to Thốt Nốt and began attacking the civilians and the French forces there. The French saw the disagreements as an opportunity to divide the Hòa Hảo and gain an anti-Việt Minh ally, and offered material aid, which Ba Cụt accepted. Ba Cụt repeatedly made treaties with the French colonial forces to fight the Việt Minh in return for arms and money, but he broke his end of the bargain and sometimes fought the Cao Đài instead of the communists. He made five such deals with the French, but he abandoned his military responsibilities each time. It was said that Ba Cụt sometimes broke away with the encouragement of Soái, who was still allied to the French, but nevertheless is believed to have given Ba Cụt weapons to fight the French. The French continued to furnish him with supplies despite his disloyalty and <b>unreliability</b> because they lacked the personnel to patrol all of Vietnam but had spare equipment. Some historians have claimed Ba Cụt's anti-French activities were not taken seriously as he was able to pass through French checkpoints without incident. There are also reports that he was accompanied by French intelligence agents during periods when he was nominally opposed to the French. The other Hòa Hảo commanders generally had the same general outlook as Ba Cụt; they were stridently opposed to the Việt Minh due to Sổ's assassination, and sometimes fought alongside and received supplies from the French, but at times they lapsed into apathy and refused to attack.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To realize object {{adaptability}} {{with a clear}} conceptual framework, a {{role model}} Epsilon was proposed. The novelty of Epsilon model {{is its ability to}} change object’s behavior dynamically. However, such kind of flexibility also easily brings type-unsafety and other <b>unreliabilities.</b> This paper proposes a small core language ɛ that formalizes some key concepts of object adaptation, which is informally described in the Epsilon model. In ɛ, three kinds of objects, context instances, role instances, and class instances exist at run-time. A role instance is a member of a context instance where how role instances are collaborating with each other is encapsulated. A class instance can dynamically assume a role by binding itself with a role instance, and can also throw the role away. Their relationship can change during computation, and ɛ’s type system assures that the computation does not go wrong, even though some exceptional cases concerning downcasting exist. This formalization clarifies the essential features of the object adaptation incorporated in Epsilon model and provides a solid base for program analysis and language processor implementation. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to detect changes in feces after intestinal surgery (massive resection or enterotomy) in dogs and cats. Also the effects on feces after giving the patient a easy digestive diet (Royal Canin Intestinal, RCI) is examined. The influence of different saving conditions of feces on the outcome of fecal analysis is determined. The fecal analysis existed of a kwalitative test on fat, fatty acids, starch and muscle in feces of dogs and cats before and after intestinal surgery. In this report the results of 10 patients (8 dogs, 2 cats) are described. These dogs and cats went through enterotomy and/or resection of the gut because of corpus aliënum, neoplasia or enteritis. One cat showed improvement of the digestion after using RCI. This could mean RCI does have positive influence on the digestion but this improvement could also be caused by adaptation of the intestines. One dog did have positive digestive test results after enterotomy. Of many patients the samples still have to come in. At this moment there are little results to define a conclusion. We can put questionmarks at the use of fecal analysis due to many <b>unreliabilities.</b> Saving fecal samples at different temperatures did not affect the outcome of the results of fecal analysis.

The gains of the reconfigured control laws are selected first by employing a geometric approach where a set of controllers guarantees that the output of the faulty agent imitates that of the healthy agent and the consensus achievement objectives are satisfied. Next, the remaining degrees of freedom in the selection of the control law gains are used to minimize the bound on a specified H_∞ performance index. The effects of uncertainties and imperfections in the FDI module decision in correctly estimating the fault severity as well as delays in invoking the reconfigured control laws are investigated and a bound on the maximum tolerable estimation uncertainties and time delays are obtained. Our proposed distributed and cooperative control recovery approach is applied to a team of five autonomous underwater vehicles to demonstrate its capabilities and effectiveness in accomplishing the overall team requirements subject to various actuator faults, delays in invoking the recovery control, fault estimation and isolation imperfections and <b>unreliabilities</b> under different control recovery scenarios...|$|R
