5|$|In 1916, Pingali Venkayya {{submitted}} thirty new designs, in {{the form}} of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the <b>upper</b> <b>right,</b> and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use.

The larger section depicts George Stephenson's Locomotion No 1, the steam locomotive that hauled the first train on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, representing the importance of the railway industry to the area. Across the bottom of the shield is a ribbon bearing the club's nickname, The Quakers, and the whole rests on a bed of oak leaves, symbolic of strength and endurance.|$|E

5|$|When a {{main-sequence star}} consumes the {{hydrogen}} at its core, {{the loss of}} energy generation causes its gravitational collapse to resume. Stars with less than 0.23 , are predicted to directly become white dwarfs when energy generation by nuclear fusion of hydrogen at their core comes to a halt. In stars between this threshold and 10 , the hydrogen surrounding the helium core reaches sufficient temperature and pressure to undergo fusion, forming a hydrogen-burning shell. In consequence of this change, the outer envelope of the star expands and decreases in temperature, {{turning it into a}} red giant. At this point the star is evolving off the main sequence and entering the giant branch. The path which the star now follows across the HR diagram, to the <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> of the main sequence, is called an evolutionary track.|$|E
5|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player defends their client and cross-examines the witnesses. They can {{move back and}} forth between the statements in each testimony; if they find a contradiction between a statement and the evidence, they can point out the contradiction by presenting a relevant piece of evidence or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads to changes in the testimony. A life bar, representing the judge's patience, is shown in the <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> corner of the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and their client is declared guilty. The bar will also decrease if the player makes mistakes while trying to break psyche-locks; however, the player can not lose while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the life bar gets restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and it gets fully restored when the player completes an episode.|$|E

5|$|However, more conveniently, {{a pair of}} indices (n,m) is used instead. The indices {{refer to}} equally long unit vectors at 60° angles to each other across a single 6-member carbon ring.

(See the <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> corner of the diagram at right.) To visualize a CNT with indices (n,m), draw n a1 unit vectors across the graphene sheet, then draw m a2 unit vectors at a 60° angle to the a1 vectors, then add the vectors together. The line representing {{the sum of the}} vectors will define the circumference of the CNT along the plane perpendicular to its long axis, connecting one end to the other. In the diagram at right, Ch is a (4,2) vector: the sum of 4 unit vectors from the origin directly to the right, then 2 unit vectors at a 60° angle down and to the right.|$|E
5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls.

Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed.

40|$|Abstract Background Central {{and lateral}} lymph node metastases are quite common in {{patients}} with papillary thyroid carcinoma, and the predictors for those metastases have been well studied. <b>Right</b> <b>upper</b> paraesophageal lymph node metastasis has rarely been studied. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the clinicopathological characteristics that may be risk factors for <b>right</b> <b>upper</b> paraesophageal lymph node metastasis {{in patients with}} papillary thyroid carcinoma. Methods This was a prospective observational study of 243 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) who underwent total thyroidectomy and comprehensive central lymph node dissection with or without lateral lymph node dissection between April 2008 and January 2010. The clinicopathologic findings from these patients were investigated and the patterns of lymph node metastasis were analyzed in the patients who had <b>right</b> <b>upper</b> paraesophageal lymph node disease. Results Of the 243 patients undergoing lymph node dissection, 14 had <b>right</b> <b>upper</b> paraesophageal lymph node metastases. Two of these patients had <b>right</b> <b>upper</b> paraesophageal lymph node metastasis only, without central compartment metastasis. Univariate analysis of clinicopathologic findings showed that <b>right</b> <b>upper</b> paraesophageal lymph node metastasis had significant association with larger primary tumors, multifocal tumors, extrathyroid extension, and lymphatic invasion (p 0. 05 for each factor). Conclusions Although there were no independent predictors of <b>right</b> <b>upper</b> paraesophageal lymph node metastasis, it can be the only site of metastasis without other compartmental metastasis. Therefore, during surgery for patients with central or lateral lymph node metastases from PTC, it may be helpful to examine the <b>right</b> <b>upper</b> paraesophageal lymph nodes. </p...|$|R
