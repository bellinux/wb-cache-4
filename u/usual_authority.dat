The lady was quick to perceive the firmness of his purpose, and would not (even had she been particularly averse to the proposed measure) hazard her <b>usual</b> <b>authority</b> by a fruitless opposition.

She was on her mettle, and very anxious to show that she could sit at table with Adrian Urmand, and be at her ease. She was not at her ease, but she made a bold fight--which was more than was done by her uncle or her aunt. Michel was unable to speak in his ordinary voice or with his <b>usual</b> <b>authority,</b> and Madame Voss hardly uttered a word. Urmand, whose position was the hardest of all, struggled gallantly, but was quite unable to keep up any continued conversation. The old lady had been thoroughly silenced, and neither she nor her sister again opened their mouth. When Madame Voss rose from her chair in order that they might all retire, the consciousness of relief was very great.|$|E

5000|$|Due to its {{emphasis}} on small-unit tactics, its infantry-centric ethos, and its tradition of empowering junior NCOs to exercise first-level leadership, the U.S. Marine Corps' Tables of Organization (TOs) usually places corporals (as well as sergeants and staff sergeants) in billets where other services would normally have higher ranking NCOs in authority. For example, the USMC Table of Organization [...] "billet" [...] rank for rifle fire team leader, rifle squad leader, and rifle platoon sergeant is corporal (E-4), sergeant (E-5), and staff sergeant (E-6), respectively. However, the same positions (Table of Organization and Equipment [...] "slots") in US Army infantry units are one grade higher and, except in fire teams (both services with four men in each team), the equivalent Army units are smaller (viz., USMC rifle squad and rifle platoon - 13 men and 43 men, respectively, vice US Army rifle squad and rifle platoon - 9 men and 34 men, respectively). Specifically, for the Army rifle units, the rank of the fire team, squad leader, and platoon sergeant are: sergeant (E-5), staff sergeant (E-6), and sergeant first class (E-7), respectively. Similarly, the term [...] "strategic corporal" [...] refers to the special responsibilities conferred upon a Marine corporal over against the normal responsibilities, and <b>usual</b> <b>authority,</b> of service members in the grade of E-4 in the other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces.|$|E

40|$|Inaugural lecture [...] Faculty of Law, Rand Afrikaans University, 17 August 1978 Since {{a company}} as a legal persona must {{necessarily}} act through agents, the law of agency {{plays an important role}} in dealings with companies. However, the law of agency as applicable to companies has undergone some considerable changes. Firstly, as a result of section 36 of the Companies Act, a company is bound to ultra vires acts and is not even allowed to rely on the lack of authority of its directors. In the second place the position of third parties dealing with the company is severely curtailed as a result of the doctrine of constructive notice. The most important adaptation of normal agency principles was achieved as a result of the so-called Turquand rule. Bona fide third parties dealing with the company are entitled to assume that the internal affairs of the company were carried out in the prescribed way. Therefore they are allowed to hold the company to the contract irrespective of the fact that it may be shown that the agent lacked the necessary authority. Unfortunately the Turquand rule and estoppel were often confused with each other -to the detriment of bona fide third parties. It is therefore necessary to be able to define the exact scope of the Turquand rule. It is submitted that this rule should only be applied if it is shown that the organ or officer acting on behalf of the company has been appointed to a certain office in the company and that he is acting within the scope of his <b>usual</b> <b>authority.</b> Should it be proved that he was never appointed to an office in the company or that the act which he performed fell outside his <b>usual</b> <b>authority,</b> the third party will have to rely on estoppel. It is clear that the doctrine of constructive notice has outlived its usefulness and ought to be abolished. The so-called protection of the company inherent in this doctrine could be retained by means of a rebuttable presumption that third persons dealing with the company are aware of the contents of the company's public documents. Bona fide thirds would thus be adequately protected...|$|E
40|$|As Simon P. Keefe's book begins, the German pedagogue Heinrich Christoph Koch is {{defending}} the concerto from his <b>usual</b> <b>authority</b> on aesthetic values, the Allgemeine Theorie der schönen Künste (1771 - 74) of Johann Georg Sulzer. The Theorie complained that "the concerto {{appears to have}} more the purpose of giving a skillful player {{the opportunity to be}} heard [...] . than to be used for the rendering of passions," a stern judgment given Sulzer's conviction that expressing emotion was tantamount to a moral responsibility in the arts (quoted in Koch 1983 : 209). Koch countered by imagining soloist and accompaniment as partners in a "passionate dialogue," in which the soloist "expresses his feelings to the orchestra, and it signals him through short interspersed phrases sometimes approval, sometimes acceptance of his expression [...] . by a concerto I imagine something similar to the tragedy of the ancients, where the actor expressed his feelings not towards the pit, but to the chorus" (quoted in Keefe, 17 - 18). While not always agreeing that what soloist and orchestra share are feelings, many subsequent writers would echo Koch's description of the concerto as conversation or drama. No works have been more affected than his ideal, the concertos of Mozart...|$|E

25|$|The <b>usual</b> {{technique}} for <b>authorities,</b> either public entities such as law enforcement or private organizations like companies, seizing a computer (usually a laptop) {{that they believe}} is being used improperly is to first physically separate the suspect user from the computer enough {{that he or she}} cannot touch it, to prevent them from closing its lid, unplugging it or typing a command. Once they have done so, they often install a device in the USB port that spoofs minor actions of a mouse, touchpad or keyboard, preventing the computer from going into sleep mode, from which it would usually return to a lock screen which would require a password. One program commonly used for this purpose is Mouse Jiggler.|$|R
60|$|So golden a conjecture, tinctured {{with such}} {{fascinating}} extravagance, was too tempting {{not to be}} immediately snapped at by the gudgeons of learning; and, accordingly, there were divers profound writers ready to swear to its correctness, and to bring in their <b>usual</b> load of <b>authorities</b> and wise surmises, wherewithal to prop it up.

40|$|Community based natural {{resource}} management (CBNRM) {{is a fairly}} new concept to be implemented in {{natural resource}} management in Cambodia. The implementation process {{is still going on}} and the political, social and economic situation in the country {{plays a major role in}} this process. The history of Cambodia tells about a country affected by changing regimes, genocide, corruption and lack of social capital and this have an effect on the implementation of CBNRM. This project is discussing the implementation of community based natural resource management (CBNRM) in Cambodia with emphasis on participation by the local population since these are the target group in CBNRM. The organisational structure of Cambodian society is a constraint when implementing CBNRM since there is no tradition for people’s organisation within communities and the patron-client relationship brings further implications when power structures are reproduced in the decisionmaking processes and hindering poor people to have a say in the decision-making. Power relations play a big role in decision-making concerning natural resource management in Cambodia and participation at all levels of society is thus difficult to obtain. Government authorities are reluctant to transfer power to local people, and national and international agencies implementing CBNRM are also hesitant to include the local population in the decision-making process. Hence in many instances of the decision-making and implementation of CBNRM it is business as <b>usual,</b> where <b>authorities</b> and powerful people make decisions and local people are only participating to a minor extent...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, for {{the leader}} of the House vexation {{followed}} vexation. “The worst incident {{in the history of our}} reform struggle,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to the prime minister from the House, on May 28, “has occurred to-night. A most barefaced proposal further to load the bill by an instruction to insert clauses respecting bribery has been carried against us by a majority of 10; the numbers were 248 to 238. This is extremely discouraging, and it much reduces the <b>usual</b> strength and <b>authority</b> of the government. This defeat alters our position with reference to fresh defeats.” The air was thick with ideas and schemes for getting rid of the bill and yet keeping the ministers. “I cannot,” Mr. Gladstone says to Lord Russell (June 4), “divest such ideas and proposals of the aspect of dishonour.” They were told, he said, to introduce an amended plan next year. How would the case be altered? They would have to introduce a plan substantially identical, to meet the same invidious opposition, made all the more confident by the success of its present manœuvres.|$|R

40|$|Inexpensive roads {{constructed}} by using local knowledge of material behavior {{have been shown}} to be capable of meeting rural traffic requirements without the need for importation of hard and expensive quarried crushed rock or gravel. In Australia, low-cost, low-volume roads are typically rural roads constructed in a broad range of operating environments, varying from arid to tropical. The areas that contain the longest length of rural roads, however, are arid or semiarid and are often subjected to periods with low levels of precipitation and high levels of evaporation, frequently followed by periods of intense rainfall. Locally available materials for road making may not meet the <b>usual</b> standard road <b>authority</b> requirements for high-quality aggregate and are thus termed “marginal,” “nonstandard,” or even “inferior. ” Because these materials are a resource that cannot be ignored, locally derived specifications are formulated for specific materials to allow more efficient expansion and maintenance of road networks in remote rural areas. Many of the subgrades within arid and semiarid areas are sensitive to water ingress and are termed “cracking” or “expansive” clays. The combination of hostile environment, poor subgrade, and marginal construction aggregates means that the engineer must take an entrepreneurial approach when developing the rural road infrastructure. Some of the methods used to develop and maintain a highway infrastructure for remote rural areas in Australia are outlined, with the Western Queensland region used for illustrative purposes. ...|$|R
