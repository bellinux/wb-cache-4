In addition, the role of limits to arbitrage in the asset growth anomaly is not a manifestation of liquidity risk and is not simply ex-post justified by <b>trading</b> <b>expenses.</b> Limits to arbitrage also plays a stronger role in the anomaly than the real-investments-with-frictions argument by Li and Zhang (2010).

40|$|With {{this chapter}} {{we intend to}} {{demonstrate}} the potential practical use of intelligent agents as autonomous financial traders. We propose an architecture intended {{for the creation of}} this type of agents, consisting of an ensemble of classification and regression models, a case-based reasoning system and an expert system. This architecture was used to implement six intelligent agents, each being responsible for trading one of the following currency pairs with a 6 -hour timeframe: CHF/JPY, EUR/CHF, EUR/JPY, EUR/USD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY. These agents simulated trades during the out-of-sample period going from February of 2007 till July of 2010, having all achieved an acceptable performance. However, their strategies resulted in relatively high drawdows, and much of their profit disappeared once the trading costs were factored in the trading simulation. In order to overcome these problems, we integrated the agents in a multi-agent system, in which the agents communicate their decisions to each other before sending any market orders, and work together to eliminate redundant trades. This system averaged out the returns of the agents, thus eliminating much of the risk associated with their individual trading strategies, and also originated considerable savings in the <b>trading</b> <b>expenses.</b> Our results seem to vindicate the usefulness of the proposed trading agent architecture, and also demonstrate that there is indeed a place for intelligent agents in financial markets...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} of trading behaviour and provides a comprehensive assessment of the overall performance of all Finnish retail and institutional investors over the years 1995 through 2004 using detailed transaction data on daily trades and investor identities. In contrast to prior published studies for Finland, this study reveals a significantly superior performance achieved by households over institutions in the longer run, either {{before or after the}} <b>trading</b> <b>expenses.</b> Despite much lower transaction costs, institutions trade several times as much as the most active household age group that reduces their net return as much as for households. I also find institutional trading is the key contributor to the volatility of Nokia share price. This study further examines the trading performance of individual investors across gender and age bands and documents both males and females in their thirties are the best performing traders among their respective gender groups on either a gross or net basis. In term of gender, male groups show significantly higher turnover while females hold higher-risk stocks. Frequent trading reduces men&# 146;s net return more so than do women in all age groups. The life cycle hypothesis does not seem to apply to Finnish working males nearing retirement after Nokia price crashed in 2000. This age group of 60 to 69 were net buyers of Nokia shares, and hence does not indicate a movement out of a high-risk investment into cash or bonds. I find strong evidence of correlated trading among household groups with young and middle-aged males sharing the highest cross correlations between their contemporaneous buy intensity. The level of correlated trading is surprisingly persistent and increases year by year. This finding suggests that profitable herding behaviour encourages more information sharing among households over time...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} empirical {{evidence on the}} relative performances of Foreign Controlled Domestic Companies operating in the United Kingdom as compared to those of United Kingdom Controlled Domestic Dompanies. One hundred and fifty (150) Foreign Controlled Domestic Companies, selected from the Times 1000 (1995), were matched with 150 United Kingdom Domestic Companies on the bases of size and industry. The reported performance data of the two sub samples for five years were extracted from the FT Extel secured database. Statistical tests were then carried out, on five year average and annual bases, to establish whether there were differences in the performances {{of the two groups}} of firms. Results revealed statistically significant differences in the reported performances of Foreign Controlled Domestic Companies and United Kingdom Domestic Companies operating in the United Kingdom over the five year period. Foreign controlled firms significantly under performed United Kingdom Domestic Companies of comparable size and industry. The lower profitability figures reported by these firms were {{partly as a result of}} higher <b>trading</b> <b>expenses.</b> The study also found differences in the year to year magnitude of under performance by Foreign Controlled Domestic Companies. While findings in this study corroborate those of earlier United States based studies, the management and owners of Foreign Controlled Domestic Companies’ parents should be interested in the apparent underperformance of their United Kingdom based assets. It is possible, however, that the figures reported do not reflect real asset performance. In which case, the United Kingdom tax authorities may want to take a closer look at Foreign Controlled Domestic Ccompanies’ reported performances to establish whether they are the outcome of income shifting practices. Future studies could examine how the performances of the managers of these foreign located assets are evaluated and rewarded and explore other possible explanatory factors for their reported under performance...|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies two {{well known}} anomalies, the asset growth anomaly and the {{external}} financing anomaly. Chapter 1 examines {{the role of}} limits to arbitrage on the asset growth anomaly or the negative relationship between capital investment or asset growth and subsequent stock returns. We hypothesize that if the negative relationship is due to mispricing, it should be more pronounced and more persistent when there are more severe limits to arbitrage. The empirical evidence supports our hypothesis and the anomaly also vanishes when arbitrage is easy. Our findings are neither due to conventional risks, firm characteristics, equity issuance, idiosyncratic risk, manifestation of liquidity risk, and are not ex-post justified by <b>trading</b> <b>expenses</b> consisted of bid-ask spreads and commissions. Finally, limits to arbitrage also subsume the firm-size effect in the cross-sectional variation in the asset growth anomaly documented by Cooper et al. (2008) and Fama and French (2008). Chapter 2 offers a novel understanding of {{the cause of the}} external financing anomaly or the negative relationship between net overall external financing activities and future stock returns. Recent studies argue that the negative relationship is driven by earnings management and/or investment growth. However, we find that about half of the anomaly remains unexplained by these interpretations. The remaining predictability is not due to exposures to conventional risks, firm characteristics, the accruals factor, the asset growth factor, the wealth transfer hypothesis, or the issuer risk hypothesis, and is not driven by performance delistings or delistings associated with negative returns or unknown risks. Instead, it is attributed to the overvalued young and small unprofitable firms that lack internal funds and have limited access to public debt markets rely heavily on equity and modestly on private debt external financing to pursue their ambitious growth strategies through heavily investing in research and development...|$|R

Based on the distinction between economies' aggregate output and expenditure and {{on the premise that}} exchange rates are shared variables, it develops a straightforward framework that shows how exchange rate management by China's central bank affects China's fast growing output, expenditure, employment, and trade balance, while simultaneously influencing these aggregates in its slower growing industrialized trading partners. This framework reveals that under conditions of limited private capital mobility an inflexible yuan yields higher short-run output gains for China at <b>trading</b> partners' <b>expense</b> through a form of ''exchange rate protection.

This is neither a comprehensive course in ethical philosophy {{nor is it a}} course in which I will pretend to be able to confer on students a previously undiscovered ability to tell right from wrong. Instead, this course is designed to give you the opportunity to think about applying your own moral code {{to a wide variety of}} business situations. This process will be enriched by allowing you to compare your opinions and arguments to those of other students and to those that have currency in society or in academic discussions drawn from philosophy, economics and other disciplines. While much of the emphasis in the classroom will be on learning through consideration of real or simulated examples (cases, role playing, presentations, and videos), I will also direct your attention to ethical philosophy. Among the more abstract questions we will examine are such issues as whether corporations (as opposed to individuals) can have moral responsibilities and whether there are moral limitations on the exercise of free enterprise. Deleted: 13 : 50 Deleted: TR 11 Deleted:. 2 During the semester I will make every effort to bring up some the most provocative issues that businesses and managers face in real life. These include, but are not limited to, issues related to: discrimination, product safety, worker safety, environmental impacts of business activity, strike behavior (including discussion of picket-lines and use of replacement workers), worker privacy, industrial espionage, bribery, animal rights, final use or abuse of products (e. g. armaments, drugs, pornography), insider <b>trading,</b> <b>expense</b> account padding, malingering, plant closures, and bankruptcy.

Given the nature of the issues addressed, it is unlikely that an ethical consensus is achievable on all, or perhaps even any, of the issues to be discussed. In some cases, students may not even agree that a given issue is one of ethics. In all cases, however, I will argue that being sensitive to the kinds of issues that have the potential to cause moral outrage will not only help you decide how to act morally in business situations, but will also help you to recognize the strategic threats and opportunities that ethical issues can represent for individuals and for companies...|$|R
