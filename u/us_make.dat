25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} of {{ourselves}} as having free will. This lets <b>us</b> <b>make</b> judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We can be sure that this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and {{there is no room for}} a free will to influence events.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} of those arrangements is when rooks are symmetric about {{the centre of}} the board. Let us designate with Gn the number of arrangements in which n rooks are placed on a board with n ranks and n files. Now let <b>us</b> <b>make</b> the board to contain 2n ranks and 2n files. A rook on the first file can be placed on any of the 2n squares of that file. According to the symmetry condition, placement of this rook defines the placement of the rook that stands on the last file − it must be arranged symmetrically to the first rook about the board centre. Let us remove the first and the last files and the ranks that are occupied by rooks (since the number of ranks is even, the removed rooks cannot stand on the same rank). This will give a board of 2n−2 files and 2n−2 ranks. It is clear that to each symmetric arrangement of rooks on the new board corresponds a symmetric arrangement of rooks on the original board. Therefore, G2n = 2nG2n−2 (the factor 2n in this expression comes from the possibility for the first rook to occupy any of the 2n squares on the first file). By iterating the above formula one reaches to the case of a 22 board, on which there are 2 symmetric arrangements (on the diagonals). As a result of this iteration, the final expression is G2n = 2n'n! For the usual chessboard (88), G8 = 244! = 1624 = 384 centrally symmetric arrangements of 8 rooks. One such arrangement is shown in Fig. 2.|$|E

500|$|On 9 November 1889, a {{large number}} of {{officers}} gathered in the Military Club and decided to stage a coup d'état aimed at the overthrow of the monarchy. Two days later in the house of Rui Barbosa a plan to execute the coup was drawn up by officers who included Benjamin Constant and Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, plus two civilians: Quintino Bocaiúva and Aristides Lobo. It was the only significant meeting in which civilian republicans participated, as Deodoro wished to exclude them from what he considered to be a strictly military matter. Deodoro still hesitated: [...] "I wanted to follow the Emperor's coffin, who is old and whom I deeply respect." [...] But he eventually yielded to pressure: [...] "He [...] wants it thus, let <b>us</b> <b>make</b> the Republic. Benjamin and I will take care of the military action; Mr. Quintino and his friends will organize everything else." ...|$|E
500|$|In Homilies on Ecclesiastes, he wrote: [...] "'I got me slave-girls and slaves.' For what price, tell me? What did {{you find}} in {{existence}} {{worth as much as}} this human nature? What price did you put on rationality? How many obols did you reckon the equivalent of the likeness of God? How many staters did you get for selling that being shaped by God? God said, Let <b>us</b> <b>make</b> man in our own image and likeness. If he is in the likeness of God, and rules the whole earth, and has been granted authority over everything on earth from God, who is his buyer, tell me? Who is his seller? To God alone belongs this power; or, rather, not even to God himself. For his gracious gifts, it says, are irrevocable. (...) God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, when we had been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom. But if God does not enslave what is free, who is he that sets his own power above God's?" ...|$|E
500|$|Feargus Urquhart, Obsidian's CEO, {{explained}} why {{they chose to}} use a crowd funding model for Pillars of Eternity instead of the traditional developer and publisher arrangement: [...] "What Kickstarter does is let <b>us</b> <b>make</b> a game that is absolutely reminiscent of those great games, since {{trying to get that}} funded through a traditional publisher would be next to impossible." [...] In an interview, Josh Sawyer said that being free of the limitations of a publisher would enable them to [...] "delve into more mature subject matter slavery, hostile prejudice (racial, cultural, spiritual, sexual), drug use and trade, and so on will all help flesh out the story". Obsidian was said to be inspired by InXile Entertainment's success of using Kickstarter to fund Wasteland 2. Chris Avellone said during the project's announcement that if the campaign were to succeed, Pillars of Eternity would become a franchise. He also ruled out a possible console port of the game, saying, [...] "Those [...] limitations affect RPG mechanics and content more than players may realize (especially for players who've never played a PC RPG and realize what's been lost over the years), and often doesn't add to the RPG experience." [...] Nevertheless, the game was successfully ported to consoles later. Additionally, he has pledged to write a novella set in the game world.|$|E

[162] It is {{not enough}} that the Holy Spirit {{convince}} us of sin at our first setting out on pilgrimage, and <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> sensible of our want of Christ; but He also keeps up a sight and sense of the evil of sin in its original nature, as well as actual transgressions.
