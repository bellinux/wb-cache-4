5|$|Black tells Bletcher about Richard Alan Hance (Jeremy Roberts), {{a serial}} killer Black had helped to {{apprehend}} twenty years before. Hance was a disturbed Vietnam War veteran who marked his kills with half a playing card, a custom he picked <b>up</b> <b>during</b> his tours of duty. Black {{was one of a}} number of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who responded to an anonymous tip, leading them to Hance's location — however, the tip was called in by Hance himself and the raid became an ambush. Three agents were killed, and Black was cornered by Hance, who cut open his palm and nearly took Black's life before the young Black was able to overpower and arrest him.|$|E

5|$|Charles Brooke {{encouraged}} the immigration of the Chinese coolies, {{beginning in the}} 1860s, to expand the state's gambier and pepper industry. Chinese settlers in neighbouring Sabah and Pontianak also established gambier and pepper plantations, although they existed as independent fiefdoms. These plantations rose {{to become one of}} the state's major industries as worldwide prices for gambier went <b>up</b> <b>during</b> the 1880s and 1890s. In the 20th century, as worldwide gambier prices took a dive, the Kangchu channelled their efforts into pepper and opium cultivation in the state. Sarawak's Kangchu system fell into obscurity in the 1920s, as the opium trade with Hong Kong steadily declined during the course of the decade.|$|E

The captain told the first officer they would use standard USAir contaminated runway procedures that included the use of 18 degrees flaps, and also decided that they would take off with a reduced V1 speed of 110 knots.|$|E

5|$|Heston and Boyd {{both had}} to learn how to drive a chariot.

The Metropolitan See of Wallachia, directly subordinated to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, was set <b>up</b> <b>during</b> the reign of Basarab I's son, Nicolae Alexandru (1352–1364). The first silver and bronze coins were minted in Wallachia in 1365.|$|E
5|$|Major issues brought <b>up</b> <b>during</b> the {{campaign}} were the candidates' positions on President Obama's stimulus plan, which Tedisco {{did not take}} a stance on {{until late in the}} race.

Tedisco's campaign also brought up Murphy's failure to pay taxes on a company he founded in the 1990s. A frequent Murphy talking point was that Tedisco's primary residence was not in the Congressional district.|$|E

5|$|Many American {{pilots who}} took part in World War II grew <b>up</b> <b>during</b> the 1930s enthusiastically reading flying pulps such as Flying Aces, and were captivated by the {{adventure}} stories, an experience that no doubt played a part in their decision to become military aviators themselves. Joseph W.

No.410 Squadron was acknowledged as the top-scoring night fighter unit in RAF Second Tactical Air Force in the period between D-Day and VE Day, although No. 409 Squadron RCAF can now make a similar claim, on the basis that there were many victories quickly counted <b>up</b> <b>during</b> 1944 and 1945.|$|E
