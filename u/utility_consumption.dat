5000|$|The {{price of}} a utility's {{products}} and services will affect its consumption. As with most demand curves, a price increase decreases demand. Through a concept known as rate design or rate structure, regulators set the prices (known as [...] "rates" [...] {{in the case of}} utilities) and thereby affect the consumption. With declining block rates, the per-unit price of <b>utility</b> <b>consumption</b> decreases as the energy consumption increases. Typically a declining block rate is offered only to very large consumers. If conservation is the goal, regulators can promote conservation by letting prices rise. A third possible rate design is a flat rate which charges the same price for all consumption.|$|E
40|$|In many {{countries}} including Australia, residential <b>utility</b> <b>consumption,</b> {{as a primary}} measurement of infrastructure service at local and state levels, is affected by many influential factors such as different varieties of utilities, local community profiles and regional climate conditions. Due {{to the fact that}} the information of a regional residential utility consumptions and their influential factors are often held separately by different public and private agencies, there is an urgent need among the communities, the utility providers, and the utility administration organizations for an integrated view on local residential <b>utility</b> <b>consumption</b> and usage for better utility service and governance. Developing such an integrated view is challenging due to the dispersion of relevant data sets at various temporal and spatial scales and the underlying complexity of increasingly interacting factors. By using complex fuzzy sets to describe uncertainty and periodicity features at various temporal and spatial scales, this paper presents a conceptual method for modeling residential <b>utility</b> <b>consumption</b> in the development of a geographic-business intelligence-based infrastructure information platform. Through the presented method, cross-organization residential <b>utility</b> <b>consumption</b> pattern can be extracted through a knowledge-based pattern mining technique.

40|$|Large {{populations in}} the {{developing}} world lack adequate access to products, such as essential medicines, whose use confers positive externalities. Because of the critical role played by the privatesector distribution channel, donors (e. g., the Global Fund) are beginning to devote substantial resources to fund subsidies that encourage the channel to improve the availability of these products. A key question for a donor is whether it should subsidize the purchases or sales of the private channel. We find the answer depends crucially on whether consumers are homogeneous or heterogeneous in their valuation of the product. For the case of heterogeneous consumers ’ valuations, we provide evidence that subsidizing sales leads to greater expected donor <b>utility,</b> <b>consumption,</b> and social welfare. When consumers ’ valuations are homogeneous, we establish the opposite conclusion: subsidizing purchases leads to greater expected donor <b>utility,</b> <b>consumption,</b> and social welfare.

40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the energy use and occupant comfort of a high-density multi-residential development in Melbourne, Australia. The project building is a graduated three to nine story apartment and retail complex, a highly innovative mixed use and mixed tenure apartment offering sustainable and affordable living. In order to test if the designed performance of the project building has been achieved, a post-occupancy evaluation (POE) was conducted over a whole year period. On-site energy audit including natural gas, electricity and water was undertaken {{on a monthly basis}} in all 199 apartments, and occupant satisfaction was measured using the Building User Satisfaction (BUS) survey. Annual <b>utility</b> <b>consumption</b> was calculated and analysed according to apartment type (e. g. internal areas, number of rooms). The annual <b>utility</b> <b>consumption</b> per household seems far less than the average household consumption in the same suburb, demonstrating statistically significant differences existed in the <b>utility</b> <b>consumption</b> according to the apartment type. The building occupant survey showed a high level of satisfaction with overall building design and performance, however, indicated less satisfaction with the storage and space of the project building. Although the respondents demonstrated that they were thermally comfortable and satisfied with the overall condition in winter, they seemed uncomfortable and dissatisfied with the overall thermal condition in summer. The issues on overheating (hot-cold), dry and stuffy condition arose in the occupant survey. As the project building was developed as commercially replicable pilot, it is expected that this research could provide an insight into the interaction between sustainable high-density housing and its occupants and even further contribute to developing a regenerative design framework for high-density urban living...|$|E

A joint characterization reduces the choice between discounting rules and medial limits to the choice between anonymity and the strong Pareto principle.

The procedure is confined to treat the single pollutant case, and it is based on a linear programming formulation that relies on necessary conditions of optimality and a heat transshipment model. An LP model is first solved to obtain minimum water usage and minimum heating utility target values. Once the energy and water targets have been identified, an MILP model is generated. This model, which accounts for non-isothermal mixing, provides the information needed to construct the water reuse structure as well as the corresponding heat exchanger network. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
