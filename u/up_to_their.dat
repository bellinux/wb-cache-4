5|$|The Hokies lived <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> favored {{status in}} the first half, running up a 21-3 lead before halftime, {{thanks in part to}} a well-executed pass by wide {{receiver}} Eddie Royal on a trick play.

Rhodes walked down the aisle toward DiBiase and Sapphire but was attacked from behind by Savage. Savage controlled most of the match, and Sherri interfered to help him while the referee was distracted. Rhodes made a brief comeback, but Savage was able to pin him after hitting him with Sherri's purse, which was said to be loaded with a heavy object. After the match, Rhodes chased after DiBiase and Sapphire but was unable to catch <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> departing limousine.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Hamilton {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} best {{prospect}} in the Padres organization. He {{was sent to the}} Padres' affiliate, the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes. One of Hamilton's teammates with the Quakes was 17-year-old and future All-Star Derrek Lee. During his time with the Quakes, he went 10 with a 4.09 ERA in 11 innings during two starts. The Padres then called him <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> Double-A affiliate, the Wichita Wranglers. In Wichita, Hamilton had four wins and nine losses with a 3.97 ERA in 15 starts. After a combined 39 appearances during two seasons, Hamilton was called up to Triple-A Las Vegas. With Las Vegas he went 32 with a 4.40 ERA in eight starts.|$|E

5|$|Omaha had terrible streets {{through the}} late 1880s, which caused many {{residents}} to believe the city was not progressing appropriately. This lack of responsiveness by the city government was caused by property owners throughout the city {{who did not want}} to pay for improvements. On rainy days stagecoaches would sink <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> hubcaps, and residents wore knee-high boots to wade through the mud, and at times rivers ran through the streets.|$|E

5|$|The Ascensio Scholarum, {{inherited}} from the College of St Omer, in its present form, is the opening address of the headmaster {{at the beginning of}} the year to the entire school gathered in the Academy Room. Previously, it was a formal transition for pupils from one playroom to the next {{at the beginning of the}} year, which involved a pupil from each year announcing to the playroom of the year below them that the next playroom had been vacated by the senior pupils.

5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpecker species live <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> name and feed on insects and other invertebrates living under bark and in wood, but overall {{the family is}} characterized by its dietary flexibility, with many species being both highly omnivorous and opportunistic. The diet includes ants, termites, beetles and their larvae, caterpillars, spiders, other arthropods, bird eggs, nestlings, small rodents, lizards, fruit, nuts and sap. Many insects and their grubs are taken from living and dead trees by excavation. The bird may hear sounds from inside the timber indicating {{where it will be}} productive to create a hole.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the legions {{underwent}} these transformations, the auxilia were reorganized and a number of allied troops were formalised into standing units similar to legions. Rather than being raised re-actively when required, the process of raising auxiliary troops was carried out in advance of conflicts according to annual targets. Whereas the internal organisation of the auxilia had previously been left <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> commanders, in the early empire they were organised into standardised units known as turmae (for cavalry alae) and centuriae (for infantry cohortes). Although never becoming as standardised in their equipment as the legions, and often retaining some national flavour, the size of the units at least was standardised to some degree. Cavalry were formed into either an ala quingenaria of 512 horsemen, or an ala millaria of 1,000 horsemen. Likewise, infantry auxilia could be formed into a cohors quingenaria of 500 men or a cohors millaria of 1,000 men. Mixed cavalry/infantry auxiliaries were typically formed with a larger proportion of foot than horse troops: the cohors equitata quingenaria consisted of 380 foot and 120 horsemen, and the cohors equitata millaria consisted of 760 foot and 240 horsemen.|$|E

5|$|Birmingham City {{were founded}} as Small Heath Alliance in 1875, and from 1877 played their home games at Muntz Street. The club turned {{professional}} in 1885, {{and three years}} later became the first football club to become a limited company with a board of directors, {{under the name of}} Small Heath F.C. Ltd. From the 1889–90 season they played in the Football Alliance, which ran alongside the Football League. In 1892, Small Heath, along with the other Alliance teams, were invited to join the newly formed Football League Second Division. They finished as champions, but failed to win promotion via the test match system; the following season promotion to the First Division was secured after a second-place finish and test match victory over Darwen. The club adopted the name Birmingham Football Club in 1905, and moved into their new home, St Andrew's Ground, the following year. Matters on the field failed to live <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> surroundings. Birmingham were relegated in 1908, obliged to apply for re-election two years later, and remained in the Second Division until after the First World War.|$|E
5|$|In February, the 390th Rifle Division {{became an}} Armenian {{national}} division {{as part of}} an attempt to overcome the language barrier, as the majority of its troops still could not speak Russian fluently. As a result of mass desertions of the Caucasian troops during the previous fighting, the Armenian officer Colonel Simon Zakian replaced Vinogradov as commander of the division on 24 February. The 51st Army launched an attack on 16 March, with the 390th and 398th Rifle Divisions in reserve. On the night of 17–18 March, the 390th and 398th were moved <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> jumping-off positions in the area of Korpech village. The attacks of the two divisions began at 10:00 on 18 March, and the 390th, advancing in conjunction with the 55th Tank Brigade, overcame German resistance and captured two trench lines of the German main defensive line. By the end of the day, they had dug in on the new positions. On the morning of 19 March, Zakian committed his reserve, the 784th Rifle Regiment, into the battle. However, the rest of the attacks were unsuccessful. After army commander Vladimir Lvov received reports of a German buildup, the offensive was halted.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009, WWE premiered a new {{pay-per-view}} {{event based}} around inter-brand matches. At the time, The Miz was the second-tier champion on Raw {{after winning the}} United States Champion and was subsequently booked against SmackDowns Intercontinental Champion, John Morrison. In the build <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> first match since splitting, the two hosted a one-off edition of The Dirt Sheet on the October 16 episode of SmackDown where the two compared themselves to '80s tag team The Rockers, debating over which is more comparable to the successful Shawn Michaels and which was the less successful Marty Jannetty. At Bragging Rights, Miz pinned Morrison to become {{the only member of}} the Raw roster to win an interpromotional match. The following month at Survivor Series, Miz captained a team of five wrestlers against Team Morrison in a five-on-five Survivor Series elimination match and once again bested his former partner. At the Tribute to the Troops in December, Miz rolled up Morrison for the win in a singles match. The two had another match the following March, when John Morrison and his new partner R-Truth challenged for the Unified Tag Team Championships held by The Miz and the Big Show. Morrison was finally able to defeat The Miz in a singles match, however Morrison could not pick up the victory for the titles at WrestleMania XXVI.|$|E

5|$|The Russian army withdrew {{and retreated}} past Moscow. Napoleon entered the city, {{assuming}} its fall {{would end the}} war and Alexander would negotiate peace. However, on orders of the city's governor Feodor Rostopchin, rather than capitulation, Moscow was burned. After five weeks, Napoleon and his army left. In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the Malet coup of 1812. His army walked through snow <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> knees and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death {{on the night of}} 8/9 November alone. After the Battle of Berezina Napoleon managed to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train. On 5 December, shortly before arriving in Vilnius, Napoleon left the army in a sledge.|$|E
5|$|The September 2014 tour {{comprised}} thirteen American dates, all {{in western}} and central states. At various shows, the Funs, the Neptunas, and Kelley Stoltz were the opening acts.

5|$|The {{characters}} and graphics received positive reviews. Although IGN {{felt that the}} in-depth character traits in Final Fantasy IX could be generally found in other Final Fantasy games, it still found the characters to be engaging and sympathetic. GameSpot found the characters, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> dialogue and traits, amusing and full of humor. IGN {{also noted that the}} Active Time Event system helps to expand the player's understanding of the characters' personalities as they question many ideas and emotions. Their semi-deformed appearance, which also covers monsters of every size, contain detailed animation and design. They gave praise to the pre-rendered backgrounds, noting the careful attention given to the artwork, movement in animations and character interactivity. The movies are seen as emotive and compelling, and the seamless transition and incorporation to the in-game graphics helped to move the plot well.|$|E
