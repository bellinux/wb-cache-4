40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that a proper {{understanding}} of the justification of perceptual beliefs leaves open the possibility that normal humans, unaided by microscopes, could genuinely know, by direct observation, of the existence of a theoretical entity like an electron. A particular theory of justification called perceptual responsibilism is presented. If successful, this kind of view would <b>undercut</b> one <b>line</b> of argument that has been given (for example, by Bas van Fraassen) in support of scientific anti-realism. Various objections to the idea that electrons can be directly observed are also considered...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a CAD software {{that focuses on}} computer-aided design for injection moulds using modelling techniques. The ultimate goal of this CAD software is to enable the designer to do various mould design works. It consists of two main modules, geometric modelling and mould design. The former consists {{of a set of}} functions which can be used to create solid primitives and excute Boolean operations and the latter is able to support the design of standard mould components and some further applications such as the automatic determination of <b>undercut,</b> parting <b>lines</b> and parting surfaces, core and cavity plates, etc. This software is now implemented on a Unigraphics CAD/CAM system and operated in a dialogue mode to communicate with the user...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} an alternative method for {{the retention of}} partial dentures that relies on the engagement of tooth <b>undercuts</b> by a <b>lining</b> material. The lab procedures are also presented. A new maxillary and mandibular acrylic partial dentures were fabricated using elastomeric retention technique for a partially dentate patient. A partially dentate man reported difficulty in retaining his upper removable partial denture (RPD). The maxillary RPD was designed utilizing elastomeric retention technique. During follow-up, {{it was necessary to}} replace the retention rings due to wear. The replacement of the retention rings, in this case, was done through a chairside reline technique. Elastomeric retention technique provides exceptionally good retention can be indicated to stabilize, cushion, splint periodontally involved teeth, no enough undercut for clasps, eliminate extractions, single or isolated teeth...|$|R
5000|$|Taylor recalls {{having written}} the song {{at his home}} in Martha's Vineyard during the late spring with the sun shining in. [...] He recalls that the song, or at least the first verse and the refrain, came to him quickly and he felt lucky to have been playing his guitar at the time. [...] Despite the {{positive}} lyrics, [...] "vivacious" [...] music, and the fact that Taylor claims he felt [...] "great" [...] while writing the song, Taylor's father, Dr. Isaac M. Taylor heard a different message when he heard the song. [...] Dr. Taylor heard a note of apprehension in the song, and felt that James Taylor was [...] "wondering where his career was leading" [...] when he wrote it. [...] Taylor biographer Mark Robowsky similarly notes that although the lyrics are generally optimistic, the optimism is <b>undercut</b> by the <b>line</b> [...] "Nobody knows how we got {{to the top of the}} hill/But since we're on our way down, we might as well enjoy the ride." ...|$|R
2500|$|McCain {{appeared}} to <b>undercut</b> his <b>line</b> of attack by picking first-term Alaska governor Sarah Palin {{to be his}} running mate. Palin had been governor only since 2006, and before {{that had been a}} council member and mayor of Wasilla. The choice of Palin was controversial, however it {{appeared to}} solve two pressing concerns—McCain's age and health since a youthful vice president would succeed him to office if he died or became incapacitated, and appealing to right-wing conservatives, a group that had been comparatively unmoved by McCain. Palin also came off as more down-to-earth and relatable to average Americans than McCain, widely tarbrushed as a [...] "Beltway insider". However, media interviews suggested that Palin lacked knowledge on certain key issues, and they cast doubt among many voters about her qualifications to be Vice President or President. In this regard, her inexperience was also a liability when McCain's age and health were factored in—there was a higher-than-normal probability of Palin succeeding to the presidency and many moderates and independents chafed at this idea. [...] "One 72 year old heartbeat away from the presidency" [...] became a popular anti-GOP slogan. Late night TV host David Letterman jokingly referred to Palin as resembling [...] "a slutty flight attendant" [...] and even Obama himself on a September 9 speech referred to the Alaska governor as [...] "the equivalent of putting lipstick on a pig". She also came under attack on everything from her 17-year-old daughter giving birth to a child out of wedlock to actively participating in hunting moose and other animals. Because of Palin's conservative views, there was also concern that she would alienate independents and moderates, two groups that pundits observed McCain would need to win the election.|$|R
40|$|In the two-step putty wash {{impression}} technique after providing first impression, {{sometimes there}} are defects in the impression that can be corrected by rewash (reline), although there are different opinions regarding this technique. This study was performed by experimental method on laboratory model. In addition to ten impressions from a laboratory model with routine putty-wash technique (single wash) as control group, another ten impressions were taken with rewash (double wash) technique for evaluation. Then die stones were poured and 20 stone models were provided. Different dimensions of all stone models were compared with lab model {{and the results were}} analyzed by t - test. The height of die in the rewash impression technique comparing with control group decreased but its p-value was not statistically significant. Meanwhile, in the rewash technique, there was a significant decrease in die diameter and the distance between two dies increased due to shrinkage. Rewash impression technique leads to reduction in die diameter. When, there is an <b>undercut</b> below finishing <b>line,</b> die diameter significantly decrease in rewash technique. Rewash technique is debatable because of reduction in tooth diameter, so it is not advisable...|$|R
40|$|Power line {{corridor}} inspection is a {{time consuming}} task that is performed mostly manually. As the development of UAVs made huge progress in recent years, and photogrammetric computer vision systems became well established, {{it is time to}} further automate inspection tasks. In this paper we present an automated processing pipeline to inspect vegetation <b>undercuts</b> of power <b>line</b> corridors. For this, the area of inspection is reconstructed, geo-referenced, semantically segmented and inter class distance measurements are calculated. The presented pipeline performs an automated selection of the proper 3 D reconstruction method for on the one hand wiry (power line), {{and on the other hand}} solid objects (surrounding). The automated selection is realized by performing pixel-wise semantic segmentation of the input images using a Fully Convolutional Neural Network. Due to the geo-referenced semantic 3 D reconstructions a documentation of areas where maintenance work has to be performed is inherently included in the distance measurements and can be extracted easily. We evaluate the influence of the semantic segmentation according to the 3 D reconstruction and show that the automated semantic separation in wiry and dense objects of the 3 D reconstruction routine improves the quality of the vegetation undercut inspection. We show the generalization of the semantic segmentation to datasets acquired using different acquisition routines and to varied seasons in time...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{crystal growth}} {{techniques}} enable novel devices and circuit designs to further scale and integrate heterogeneous structures for CMOS, MEMS/NEMS, and optoelectronic applications. In particular, nanowires (NW) {{are among the}} promising structures derived from these developments. Research has demonstrated the utility of NWs as a channel material for gate-all-around transistors, high sensitivity biological/chemical sensors, photodetectors, {{as well as a}} whole spectrum of LEDs and lasers. However, NW based devices are not without their fabrication challenges. Relatively simple structures for CMOS or MEMS/NEMS processes are difficult to reproduce when many NW based devices rely on a dropcast process. This thesis demonstrates a method for producing Germanium on Nothing (GON) NW arrays on a Si substrate that forgoes dropcasting and, instead, creates NWs via selective material removal methods commonly utilized by industry. GON NW arrays are formed through the sequential use of E-beam lithography, selective wet chemical etching, and reactive ion etching. Global oxide thinning in BOE leaves a thin masking layer that protects the underlying Si, preventing etching in a TMAH solution. GON regions are defined by E-beam lithography and are subject to a RIE which creates release points in the remaining SiO 2. Unmasked Si is then etched by a TMAH solution, <b>undercutting</b> the Ge <b>lines,</b> leaving an array of suspended Ge wires. NW dimensions are reached by thinning the Ge wire diameter with a H 2 O 2 solution. NWs with ~ 50 nm diameters and ~ 200 nm lengths, as well as 10 [micron] by 10 [micron] membranes of Ge/SiO 2, have been demonstrated in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{primarily}} {{motivated by the}} industrial need for control of {{problems associated with the}} Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) of small bore titanium and austenitic stainless steel tubes. These include: pore creation and entrapment in the weld zone, and variability of the fusion zone geometry. The primary aim of this study was the development of a low current orbital plasma welding capability using a structured approach which could lead to defect minimisation. The methodology should also have the potential to be used {{in a number of different}} conditions, extending the use of plasma welding in both melt-in and keyhole modes for the orbital welding of small bore tubes. The project originally involved the modification of a totally enclosed orbital GTAW welding head for low current welding operations. It was established that for the current range required for small bore and small to medium thickness tubes, the use of a solid copper torch was sufficient to provide the required heat absorption. A stable arc was produced even for very low current values (down to 7 A) while arc voltages were within the operating range of a standard GTA welding power source. Procedural (i. e. off line) control was adopted for identification and optimisation of welding parameters. Since no procedure was available for the proposed welds it was necessary to generate the parameters required for the production of consistent weld profiles. Simultaneously, an expert system has been developed for the determination of optimum process parameters based on empirical models, developed using statistical techniques. Parameter combinations were selected based on physical as well as statistical relevance, providing a measure of confidence when predicting the required weld bead output characteristics. The approach also indicates the influence of the major input parameters on weld bead geometry and defect formation, such as undercut. Two quality acceptance criteria were employed during this investigation, weld bead dimensional accuracy, and the type and seriousness of defects present (penetration / burn-through, porosity and <b>undercut).</b> Off <b>line</b> programming was utilised to control heat build up and to ensure welds were obtained with the desired geometry and minimal defect levels. The end result was the development of a prototype system for low current orbital plasma welding (in both melt-in and keyhole mode) of small bore tubes in a totally enclosed head. Tolerant procedures for low current orbital melt-in and particularly keyhole welding have been generated and a systematic methodology for the prediction and optimisation of welding procedures based on predetermined criteria has been developed...|$|R
