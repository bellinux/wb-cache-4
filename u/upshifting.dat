Further back, Villeneuve was unable to shift into a higher gear because his automatic <b>upshifting</b> system failed and was forced to use to switch to a manual start. He then drove in a gear he did not intend to drive in, and applied his brakes hard locking his front wheels, rendering him unable to steer and made contact with team-mate Panis, who retired from the race after going into the gravel trap at Copse corner next to Trulli's car. Montoya made a quick gateway, moving up from eighth to third {{by the end of the}} first lap and his team-mate Ralf Schumacher made up five positions over the same distance. Frentzen, however, made a poor start and lost three positions before the first lap ended. Further behind, Verstappen made the best start in the field as he moved up from 17th to eleventh and Alesi moved up four positions. At the end of the first lap, Michael Schumacher led by 0.3 seconds from Häkkinen and both drivers were followed by Montoya, Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, Räikkönen, Heidfeld, Frentzen, Alesi, Villeneuve, Verstappen, de la Rosa, Button, Bernoldi, Irvine, Burti, Fisichella, Coulthard and Alonso.|$|E
5000|$|Mode {{selection}} {{allows the}} driver to choose between preset shifting programs. For example, Economy mode saves fuel by <b>upshifting</b> at lower engine speeds, while Sport mode (aka [...] "Power" [...] or [...] "Performance") delays <b>upshifting</b> for maximum acceleration. Some transmission units also have Winter mode, where higher gear ratios are chosen to keep revs {{as low as possible}} while on slippery surfaces.

40|$|Abstract- When {{pulse of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation impinges upon a moving plasmalneutral gas boundary, i. e., an ioniza-tion front, its frequency and duration are altered. The largest frequency <b>upshifts</b> and pulse compressions are obtained when radiation is incident on an ionization front moving {{at close to}} the speed of light. Such an ionization front is created when a short laser pulse photo-ionizes a gas through which it propa-gates. We have done theoretical and experimental work on the interaction of radiation with a relativistically propagating, un-derdense ionization front in a waveguide. In the experiment, 35 GHz microwave pulses were <b>upshifted</b> and compressed upon encountering a moving front. The frequency spectrum of the <b>upshifted</b> radiation was determined independently using sections of cutoff waveguides and a microwave diffraction grating. These frequency <b>upshifts</b> were proportional to the plasma density of the ionization front as predicted by the theory. The front density was determined using microwave interferometery. The pusewidths of the <b>upshifted</b> radiation were measured with fast diode detectors. These pulsewidth measurements were also in good agreement with the theory. Frequency <b>upshifts</b> and pulse compressions up to a factor of five were recorded in this experiment. 1...|$|R

50|$|The Ioniq Plug-in has {{the same}} dual-clutch {{transmission}} as the hybrid variant. This is an important differentiator for Hyundai from the majority of other hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars that use a continuously variable transmission, which {{have been criticized for}} their poor acceleration performance. Enhancing the Ioniq Plug-in fuel efficiency and dynamic driving characteristics, the driver can select either SPORT or ECO modes. The SPORT function holds lower gears longer and combines power from the engine and electric motor for maximum performance. In ECO mode, the dual-clutch transmission optimizes gear selection for efficiency, <b>upshifting</b> earlier to achieve class-leading fuel economy.|$|E
50|$|In {{a manual}} {{transmission}} car, shift time for <b>upshifts</b> {{can be reduced}} by installing a lighter flywheel. During an <b>upshift</b> the engine speed must fall for the same vehicle speed; a lighter flywheel will allow the engine speed to drop more quickly when it is unloaded leading to shorter shift times.|$|R
40|$|The de novo {{expression}} of Escherichia coli K 1, K 5, and K 12 capsules was analyzed with immunoelectron microscopy in temperature <b>upshift</b> experiments, with <b>upshift</b> from 18 degrees C (capsule restrictive) to 37 degrees C (capsule permissive).

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of in vivo {{expression of}} the polysialosyl (K 1) capsular antigen in Escherichia coli has been studied. Growth of E. coli K 1 strains at 15 degrees C prevents K 1 polysaccharide synthesis (F. A. Troy and M. A. McCloskey, J. Biol. Chem. 254 : 7377 - 7387, 1979). Synthesis is reactivated in cells grown at 15 degrees C after <b>upshift</b> to 37 degrees C. The early expression and resultant morphology of K 1 capsular antigen was monitored in temperature <b>upshift</b> experiments by using electron microscopy. Morphological stabilization of the capsule was achieved by treatment of cells with an antiserum specific for the alpha, 2 - 8 -linked polysialosyl antigen. The kinetics of K 1 capsule expression in growing cells was measured by bacteriophage adsorption with phage K 1 F, which required the K 1 capsule for binding. The results of temperature <b>upshift</b> experiments showed that capsule first appeared on the cell surface after 10 min. Subsequent bacteriophage binding increased linearly with time until a fully encapsulated state was reached 45 min after <b>upshift.</b> The initiation of K 1 capsule appearance was dependent on protein synthesis {{and the addition of}} chloramphenicol before temperature <b>upshift</b> prevented any {{expression of the}} K 1 antigen. Chloramphenicol reduced the rate of K 1 synthesis when added after temperature <b>upshift.</b> We conclude from these results that protein synthesis is a prerequisite for activation of capsule expression in vivo, but not for subsequent elongation of polysialosyl chains...|$|R
50|$|In 2004, a {{completely}} new car was introduced for the Pro series. It features a carbon fiber chassis, 6 speed sequential gearbox, and a sealed 250 hp fuel-injected Renesis engine {{very similar to the}} one in the Mazda RX-8. The MoTeC ECU uses input from the gearshift to enable <b>upshifting</b> while the driver holds the throttle wide open. The ECU also provides traction control which the driver can turn off from inside the car. The rules allow a choice among five different spring rates at each corner, and the new Öhlins dampers offer separate bump and rebound adjustments. The driver can adjust the front anti-roll bar from the cockpit.|$|E
5000|$|Some manumatic and {{semi-automatic}} transmissions {{allow the}} driver to have full control of gear selection, though most will intervene to prevent engine stalling and redlining by shifting automatically {{at the low end}} and/or high end of the engine's normal operating range. Hydraulically-coupled Manumatics and most semi-automatic transmissions also provide the option of operating {{in the same manner as}} a conventional automatic transmission, by allowing the transmission's computer to select gear changes. A few manumatics also allow an alternate automatic mode, often called [...] "sport" [...] mode, where gear selection is still fully automatic but the transmission will favor higher engine speeds (at which the engine will produce the highest horsepower and/or torque) by <b>upshifting</b> later when accelerating and downshifting earlier when slowing.|$|E
50|$|The {{electronic}} controls allow the motorcycle {{to be operated}} in three modes: Drive, Sport and Manual. In Drive and Sport, it functions much like a CVT scooter, with infinitely variable gearing upshifted and downshifted automatically for what the system determines to be optimal performance. Unlike a scooter, engine braking is always available when decelerating. The difference between Drive and Sport modes is that Drive is optimized for economy while Sport is more responsive. In Manual mode, the transmission operates in one of six discrete gears chosen by the rider by pushing a plus/minus button on the left handlebar. It feels much like a normal motorcycle, including hitting the rev limiter {{at the top of}} each gear, but the ECU prevents <b>upshifting</b> and downshifting too soon. In all modes, it automatically returns to the lowest gear when stopped. It is also possible to switch into neutral while stopped, unlike a scooter.|$|E
50|$|Conventionally, {{automatic}} transmissions have selector positions {{that allow the}} driver to limit the maximum ratio that the transmission may engage. On older transmissions, this was accomplished by a mechanical lockout in the transmission valve body preventing an <b>upshift</b> until the lockout was disengaged; on computer-controlled transmissions, the same effect is accomplished by firmware. The transmission can still <b>upshift</b> and downshift automatically between the remaining ratios: for example, in the 3 range, a transmission could shift from first to second to third, but not into fourth or higher ratios. Some transmissions will still <b>upshift</b> automatically into the higher ratio if the engine reaches its maximum permissible speed in the selected range.|$|R

40|$|We {{draw from}} {{personality}} systems interaction theory (PSI; Kuhl, 2000) and regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1997) {{to examine how}} dynamic positive and negative affective processes interact to predict both task and contextual performance. Using a twice-daily diary design {{over the course of}} a three-week period, results from multi-level regression analysis revealed that distinct patterns of change in positive and negative affect optimally predicted contextual and task performance among a sample of 71 individuals employed at a medium-sized technology company. Specifically, within persons, increases (<b>upshifts)</b> in positive affect {{over the course of a}} work day better predicted the subsequent day’s organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) when such increases were coupled with decreases (downshifts) in negative affect. The optimal pattern of change in positive and negative affect differed, however, in predicting task performance. That is, <b>upshifts</b> in positive affect over the course of the work day better predicted the subsequent day’s task performance when such <b>upshifts</b> were accompanied by <b>upshifts</b> in negative affect. The contribution of our findings to PSI theory and the broader affective and motivation regulation literatures, along with practical implications, are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|When {{shifting}} properly, {{the driver}} [...] "shifts" [...] to another gear and then releases {{pressure on the}} clutch pedal to re-engage the engine to the driveshaft. If the pedal is released quickly, a definite lurch can be felt as the engine and driveshaft re-engage and their speeds equalize. However, if the clutch is released slowly the clutch disc will [...] "slip" [...] against the flywheel; this friction permits the engine a smoother transition to its new rotation speed. Such routine slippage causes wear on the clutch analogous to the wear-and-tear on a brake pad when stopping. Some amount of wear is unavoidable, but with better clutching/shifting technique it can be minimized by releasing the clutch {{as close to the}} correct engine speed for the gear and vehicle speed as possible. When <b>upshifting,</b> this will involve allowing the engine speed to fall. Conversely, when downshifting, increasing the engine speed with the accelerator prior to releasing clutch will result in a smoother transition and minimal clutch wear.|$|E
5000|$|Double-clutching {{allows the}} driver to control the engine and {{transmission}} revolutions to synchronize, so that a smooth shift can be made; for example, when <b>upshifting,</b> the accelerator pedal is released and the clutch pedal is depressed while the gear lever is moved into neutral, the clutch pedal is then released and quickly pushed down again while the gear lever is moved to the next higher gear. Finally, the clutch pedal is released and the accelerator pedal pushed down to obtain required engine speed. Although this is a relatively fast movement, perhaps a second or so while transmission is in neutral, it allows the engine speed to drop and synchronize engine and transmission revolutions relative to the road speed. Downshifting is performed in a similar fashion, except the engine speed is now required to increase (while transmission is in neutral) {{just the right amount}} in order to achieve the synchronization for a smooth, non-collision gear change. [...] "Skip changing" [...] is also widely used; in principle operation is the same as double-clutching, but it requires neutral be held slightly longer than a single-gear change.|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{cars have}} {{computer}} systems that prevent the engine from straying too {{far into the}} redline by cutting fuel flow to the fuel injectors/fuel rail (in a direct-injected engine)/carburetor or by disabling the ignition system until the engine drops to a safer operating speed. This device {{is known as a}} rev limiter and is usually set to an RPM value at redline or a few hundred RPM above. Most Electronic Control Units (ECUs) of automatic transmission cars will upshift before the engine hits the redline even with maximum acceleration (The ECU in a sports car's automatic transmission will allow the engine to go nearer the redline or hit the redline before <b>upshifting).</b> If manual override is used, the engine may go past redline for a brief amount of time before the ECU will auto-upshift. When the car is in top gear and the engine is in redline (due to high speed), the ECU will cut fuel to the engine, forcing it to decelerate until the engine begins operating below the redline at which point it will release fuel back to the engine, allowing it to speed operate once again.|$|E

5000|$|When a {{car with}} a manual {{transmission}} is in motion with the clutch engaged, there is a mechanical connection between the engine and wheels which keep them in sync with each other. When shifting however, depressing the clutch is required. This breaks the mechanical connection between the engine and wheels, and the engine speed is no longer linked to that of the wheels. When <b>upshifting,</b> this is usually not a problem, as the tendency of the engine to reduce speed itself without gas will slow it to loosely match the lower speed of the higher gear. However, when downshifting, the engine needs to speed up to come to speed with the wheels. If the accelerator is not [...] "blipped" [...] (or briefly and quickly pressed to speed up the disengaged engine), the engine will have to take power from the wheels and momentum of the car to come to speed, which is often accompanied by a sudden deceleration of the vehicle due to the power suddenly going to the engine, often described as a [...] "lurch" [...] or [...] "jolt". This sudden external acceleration of the engine through the transmission also causes increased wear on the mechanics of the car. Therefore, a staple of advanced or professional manual-transmission driving is the [...] "rev match", or [...] "throttle blip", in which the driver quickly brings the engine up to speed with the wheels by use of the throttle. As downshifting is often necessary when accelerating into or out of a curve or other slow-down, advanced techniques such as the [...] "heel-toe method" [...] are often required, in which the toe of the right foot presses on the brake pedal, while the heel of the same foot blips the throttle.|$|E

The RP 59 gene is present as a single copy, contains an intron within the amino terminal coding portion of the gene, and harbors conserved S. cerevisiae splicing signals. Sequence elements upstream of the transcriptional start site are homologous to UASRPG, known to regulate the transcription of numerous genes in S. cerevisiae via their interaction with the trans-activating factor RAP 1.

5000|$|A tiptronic {{transmission}} can {{operate in the}} same manner as a conventional type of automatic transmission, but also offers the driver an additional method of manually overriding the automatic shift changes. By moving the shift lever into a second operating plane of the shift gate, equipped with two spring-loaded positions: [...] "upshift" [...] and [...] "downshift", the driver takes over most of the gear shifting decisions, which would ordinarily be performed by the transmission's computer. For example, this allows delayed upshifts for increased acceleration, increased engine braking, gear holding in curves, downshifting before passing, or early <b>upshifting</b> for cruising. On some models, the upshift and downshift operations can also be controlled by push-buttons or [...] "paddle shifters" [...] installed on the steering wheel, with an optional display in the instrument panel indicating the current gear selection. Since adding Tiptronic to a semi-automatic transmission involves an additional shift gate into the computer and update to the transmission software, it is inexpensive and lightweight to implement. Although tiptronic transmissions allow the driver a certain measure of discrete control, the tiptronic design is implemented using a torque converter like other automatic transmissions. A true tiptronic transmission is not a computer controlled manual transmission (with a conventional clutch), or semi-automatic transmission. Most tiptronic implementations still make some shifts automatically, primarily to protect the engine and transmission. For example, as used by licensee Audi, the five-speed tiptronic will automatically make the upshift from 1 to 2 when moving off from a stop, even when in manual mode; the transmission then waits for the user's upshift command before proceeding from 2 to 3, 3 to 4 and 4 to 5, although the transmission will still upshift if the redline is approached. On deceleration, the transmission will make all downshifts automatically when close to the tick-over or idle speed, to prevent the engine from stalling at too-low an RPM, although the user can accelerate any downshift that would not exceed the redline.|$|E
