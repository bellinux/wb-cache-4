5|$|During the 1990s, a {{broadband}} utility {{seeking to}} lay {{fiber optic cable}} paid the town {{to pass through the}} former corridor. The town <b>used</b> <b>part</b> of its payment to pave the route and open it as a public rail trail in 1997. The creation of the trail was supported by a local Rotary club, which built a pavilion along the trail. The pavilion includes a donated antique caboose. While the trail originally ended at Route44–55, it was extended eastward between 2009 and 2010, intersecting Route9W and continuing to the Poughkeepsie Bridge. The extension was paid for by stimulus funding.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 Celilo Falls was {{submerged}} by {{the construction}} of The Dalles Dam, and the native fishing community was displaced. The affected tribes received a $26.8million settlement {{for the loss of}} Celilo and other fishing sites submerged by The Dalles Dam. The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs <b>used</b> <b>part</b> of its $4million settlement to establish the Kah-Nee-Ta resort south of Mount Hood.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} plot to {{discredit}} both Dart {{and the government of}} Texas, Edwards persuaded some abolitionists in Cincinnati to give him money with which he would supposedly liberate the slaves on his plantation in Texas, which he no longer owned. Edwards also tried to get money from the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in New York, but its leader, Lewis Tappan, did not trust him and no money was forthcoming from that source. Edwards then went to England, bearing forged letters of introduction from, among others, Daniel Webster and the American Secretary of State, John Forsyth. One of these letters was to Lord Spencer, who was so impressed he gave Edwards £250 as a loan. While in England, Edwards defrauded a company in Liverpool of about $20,000, and then <b>used</b> <b>part</b> of the funds to repay Lord Spencer. The Republic of Texas ambassador in London warned the English government against Edwards. Tappan also sent warnings, so Edwards was unable to acquire more money in England and had returned to the United States by June 1841.|$|E

5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the cathedral}} was overrun by Parliamentarian troops. Along with other destruction, the troops seized {{the books of}} the cathedral library, taking them to Cardiff Castle, where they were burned along with many copies of the Book of Common Prayer. Among those invited to the castle to warm {{themselves}} by the fire on that cold winter day, were the wives of some sequestered clergymen. Also during this time of unrest, a man named Milles, {{who claimed to be}} a practising Puritan, appropriated portions of the cathedral for his own gain. Milles set up a tavern in the cathedral, <b>used</b> <b>part</b> of it as a stable, turned the choir area into a pen for his calves and used the font as a trough for his pigs.|$|E
5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria {{accumulated}} a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria struggled {{to keep up with}} its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its Paris Club creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria <b>used</b> <b>part</b> of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the Paris Club.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Sea Grant Program {{organized}} a three-day dive {{to survey the}} Fitzgerald in 1989. The primary objective was to record 3-D videotape for use in museum educational programs and production of documentaries. The expedition used a towed survey system (TSS Mk1) and a self-propelled, tethered, free swimming remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). The Mini Rover ROV was equipped with miniature stereoscopic cameras and wide angle lenses {{in order to produce}} 3-D images. The towed survey system and the Mini Rover ROV were designed, built and operated by Chris Nicholson of Deep Sea Systems International, Inc. Participants included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Geographic Society, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS), and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the latter providing RV Grayling as the support vessel for the ROV. The GLSHS <b>used</b> <b>part</b> of the five hours of video footage produced during the dives in a documentary and the National Geographic Society used a segment in a broadcast. Frederick Stonehouse, who wrote one of the first books on the Fitzgerald wreck, moderated a 1990 panel review of the video that drew no conclusions about the cause of Fitzgeralds sinking.|$|E

5|$|To promote sustainability, {{the site}} was {{selected}} directly adjacent to an already <b>used</b> <b>part</b> of a major ski area. It was also designed to minimize vegetation and the ecological footprint in the area. For energy efficiency, trees were retained to cast shade with weather protection and a shading system used to cover parts of the track. The track itself is painted white to maintain low temperatures while minimizing energy demand on the refrigeration system. Waste heat from the refrigeration plant is captured and reused to heat buildings on-site, and could provide other heat uses in the future. Any wood waste created from site clearing activities during venue construction was composted for reuse. Other on-site buildings also followed similar green building design principles.|$|E

At the time, NY18 was routed on Hamlin Center Road and <b>used</b> <b>part</b> of modern NY260 to reach the Clarkson–Hamlin town line. By the following year, NY18 was rerouted to follow Clarkson–Hamlin Town Line Road (Roosevelt Highway) while NY260 was extended northward through Walker to North Hamlin Road, then the last east–west roadway before Lake Ontario.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{a cheaper}} option was decided on, partly after a {{consultation}} process with stakeholders and citizens. The architectural design was chosen via a competition.

When nearby Quay Street was realigned in the late 1990s, a tunnel was built (completed in 2000) to provide the underground railway link. Bus services using the old bus terminal were diverted to other locations in June 2001.|$|E

25|$|Martin Bryant {{inherited}} about $570,000 AUD (£300,000 GBP or $450,000 USD) {{worth of}} property and other assets from a friend, Helen Harvey, who left her estate to him. He <b>used</b> <b>part</b> of this money to go on many trips around the world from 1993 onwards. Bryant also withdrew many thousands of dollars during this period. He used {{at least some of}} this money in late 1993 to purchase an AR-10 semi-automatic rifle through a newspaper advertisement in Tasmania. In March 1996, he had his AR-10 repaired at a gun shop and made enquiries about AR-15 rifles in other gun shops. At the time of purchase, no registration of guns outside of handguns was required in Tasmania.|$|E
25|$|After Cortés’s death, his son Don Martin, as the Marquis del Valle de Oaxaca, {{inherited}} it. From 1629 to 1747, {{the family}} gradually abandoned it, {{and the building}} {{was used as an}} ironworks, tannery, and textiles workshop. In the mid 18th century, colonial authorities ordered the restoration of the then run-down building. Three architects handled the design work, but most is thought to have been done by Gregorio Cayteano Durán. After restoration, the government used the building as a barracks and as a jail. During the Mexican War of Independence, it housed famous prisoners, such as José María Morelos y Pavon and Ignacio López Rayón. It is also possible that mayors of Cuernavaca <b>used</b> <b>part</b> of the building as the mayoral residence.|$|E
25|$|Bongo <b>used</b> <b>part</b> of {{the money}} to build up a fairly large circle of people who {{supported}} him such as government ministers, high administrators, and army officers. He had learned from Léon M'ba how to give government ministries to different tribal groups so that someone from every important group had a representative in the government. Bongo had no ideology beyond self-interest, but there was no opposition with an ideology either. He ruled by knowing how the self-interest of others could be manipulated. He was skilled at persuading opposition figures to become his allies. He offered critics modest slices of the nation's oil wealth, co-opting or buying off opponents rather than crushing them outright. He became the most successful of all Africa's Francophone leaders, comfortably extending his political dominance into the fifth decade".|$|E
