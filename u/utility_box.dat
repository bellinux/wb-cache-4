50|$|From substations, {{electricity}} is transmitted via the distribution grid at low-voltage (22-66kV). For high-voltage supply to large buildings and factories, distribution lines are {{directly connected to}} customers' electricity systems. In this case, customers must purchase and set up transformers and other equipment to run electric appliances. For low voltage supply to houses and small shops, distribution lines are first connected to the company's transformers (seen on utility poles and <b>utility</b> <b>boxes),</b> converted to 100/200V, and finally connected to end users.|$|R
50|$|The Arts District in {{downtown}} {{has become the}} center of Bakersfield's arts scene. It is also downtown's largest district. Dozens of art galleries and art related stores {{are located in the}} district; most centered around the intersection of 19th St. and Eye St. The district is also filled with public sculptures and murals. Also, most of the traffic light <b>utility</b> <b>boxes</b> have been painted, each with a unique design. In addition, the Bakersfield Museum of Art is located in neighboring Mill Creek, which is the city's only art museum.|$|R

50|$|Ah Long (derived {{from the}} Cantonese phrase '大耳窿' ("big ear hole")) is a colloquial term for illegal loan sharks in Malaysia and Singapore. They lend money {{to people who}} are unable to obtain loans from banks or other legal sources, mostly {{targeting}} habitual gamblers. Often, they discreetly advertise by sticking notices, mostly on lamp posts and <b>utility</b> <b>boxes</b> around a neighbourhood, thus vandalising public property, as authorities have to then remove such advertisements. They charge very high interest rates (generally about 40% per month/fortnight) according to Anti-Crime, Drug and Social Development Voluntary Organisation and frequently threaten violence (and administer it) towards those who fail to pay in time.|$|R
5000|$|His artwork {{was chosen}} in 2008 by Calgary Transit for their urban renewal program, [...] "Art in Motion" [...] where local artists works {{were chosen to}} help {{decorate}} unsightly <b>utility</b> <b>boxes</b> in downtown Calgary.

5000|$|Although his {{graffiti}} {{was repeatedly}} painted over, he often returned to re-apply his messages {{as soon as}} the paint dried. At the height of his graffiti career, his obsessive marking of territory made his graffiti an ever-present aspect of the streets of Hong Kong. The graffiti has been spotted at many places on the streets of Hong Kong, ranging from lampposts, <b>utility</b> <b>boxes,</b> pillars, pavements, street furniture, and building walls, to an occasional car. The contents of his calligraphic graffiti usually include his name, his title (Emperor or King of Kowloon, Hong Kong, or China), his family tree (a variable list of about 20 individuals), the names of illustrious emperors, and the exclamation, [...] "Down with the Queen of England!" [...] His complaints about the supposed misappropriation of his land were not always so formulaic, however. He occasionally demanded that the government pay him land taxes.|$|R

50|$|DS3 {{signals are}} rare except within buildings, {{where they are}} used for {{interconnections}} and as an intermediate step before being muxed onto a SONET circuit. This is because a T3 circuit can only go about 600 ft between repeaters. A customer who orders a DS3 usually receives a SONET circuit run into the building and a multiplexer mounted in a <b>utility</b> <b>box.</b> The DS3 is delivered in its familiar form, two coax cables (1 for send and 1 for receive) with BNC connectors on the ends.|$|E
50|$|The wired {{communications}} provider (telephone company) {{is responsible}} for delivery of services to a minimum (or main) point of entry (MPOE).

Two off-duty friends, Sergeant John Iammarino and Detective Daniel Caropres, stopped their car to render assistance but did not report the accident. Later, Sergeants William Brown and Christopher Tivanian (who were on-duty) came to the crash site. They reported the accident at about 2:15 a.m., but the driver was not administered a blood-alcohol test until about 3:00 a.m. He was just over the legal limit.|$|E
40|$|This Corrective Action Investigation Plan {{contains}} the U. S. Department of Energy, Nevada Operations Office's approach {{to collect the}} data necessary to evaluate corrective action alternatives appropriate for the closure of Corrective Action Unit 252 under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Corrective Action Unit 252 consists of Corrective Action Site (CAS) 25 - 07 - 02, Engine Test Stand- 1 (ETS- 1) Decontamination Pad. Located in Area 25 {{at the intersection of}} Road H and Road K at the Nevada Test Site, ETS- 1 was designed for use as a mobile radiation checkpoint and for vehicle decontamination. The CAS consists of a concrete decontamination pad with a drain, a gravel-filled sump, two concrete trailer pads, and <b>utility</b> <b>boxes.</b> Constructed in 1966, the ETS- 1 facility was part of the Nuclear Rocket Development Station (NRDS) complex and used to test nuclear rockets. The ETS- 1 Decontamination Pad and mobile radiation check point was built in 1968. The NRDS complex ceased primary operations in 1973. Based on site history, the focus of the field investigation activities will be to determine if any primary contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) (including radionuclides, total volatile organic compounds, total semivolatile organic compounds, total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel-range organics, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, total pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls) are present at this site. Vertical extent of migration of suspected vehicle decontamination effluent COPCs is expected to be less than 12 feet below ground surface. Lateral extent of migration of COPCs is expected to be limited to the sump area or near the northeast corner of the decontamination pad. Using a biased sampling approach, near-surface and subsurface sampling will be conducted at the suspected worst-case areas including the sump and soil near the northeast corner of the decontamination pad. The results of this field investigation will support a defensible e valuation of corrective action alternatives in the corrective action decision document...|$|R
40|$|Introduced {{vertebrates}} have {{a variety}} of impacts on ecosystems and economies, and many cause problems for humans. One such problem is the loss of electrical power when invasive animals cause short circuits in power-transmission equipment. Cuban treefrogs (Osteopilus septentrionalis) are known to cause power outages and are a nuisance to humans when they invade homes and defecate on doors and windows. These large, slightly toxic treefrogs were introduced into Florida from the Caribbean. They now occur throughout the peninsula of Florida and are spreading to other states in the Southeast. We used refuge choice experiments to test the effectiveness of Sniff ’n’ StopTM animal deterrent to exclude Cuban treefrogs from enclosed spaces, such as <b>utility</b> switchgear <b>boxes.</b> We found that the deterrent was effective and showed potential as a low-cost means to prevent frog-related power outages and reduce conflicts with residents in the urbanized areas preferred by these invasive frog...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the stab standards, HOSDB has developed a standard for slash resistance (2006). This standard, like the stab standards, is based on drop testing with a test knife in a mounting of controlled mass. The slash test uses the Stanley <b>Utility</b> knife or <b>box</b> cutter blades. The slash standard tests the cut resistance of the armor panel parallel to the direction of blade travel. The test equipment measures the force at the instant the blade tip produces a sustained slash through the vest. The criteria require that slash failure of the armor be greater than 80 newtons of force.|$|R
