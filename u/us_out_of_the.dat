5|$|What is most {{important}} for <b>us,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heathen fancy of a kidnapping man of the moon, which, apart from Scandinavia, was doubtless in vogue all over Teutondom, if not farther, there has evolved itself since a Christian adaptation. They say {{the man in the}} moon is a wood-stealer, who during church time on the holy sabbath committed a trespass in the wood, and was then transported to the moon as a punishment; there he may be seen with the axe on his back and the bundle of brushwood (dornwelle) in his hand. Plainly enough the water-pole of the heathen story has been transformed into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into the thornbrush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the keeping of the christian holiday; the man suffers punishment not so much for cutting firewood, as because he did it on Sunday.|$|E
25|$|However, {{toward the}} end of the war, the {{prospects}} of an Anglo-American front against the Soviet Union seemed slim from Stalin's standpoint. At the end of the war, Stalin assumed that the capitalist camp would resume its internal rivalry over colonies and trade, giving opportunity for renewed expansion at a later date, rather than pose a threat to the USSR. Stalin expected the United States to bow to domestic popular pressure for postwar demilitarization. Soviet economic advisors such as Eugen Varga predicted that the U.S. would cut military expenditures, and therefore suffer a crisis of overproduction, culminating in another great depression. Based on Varga's analysis, Stalin assumed that the Americans would offer the Soviets aid in postwar reconstruction, needing to find any outlet for massive capital investments in order to sustain the wartime industrial production that had brought the <b>U.S.</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression. However, to the surprise of Soviet leaders, the U.S. did not suffer a severe postwar crisis of overproduction. As Stalin had not anticipated, capital investments in industry were sustained by maintaining roughly the same levels of government spending.|$|E

500|$|Although US President Woodrow Wilson was re-elected in 1916 {{under the}} slogan [...] "He kept <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war", {{at the start}} of his second term he decided that Germany's {{continued}} deployment of unrestricted submarine warfare was sufficient cause for the US to enter World War I. Shortly afterward, Congress passed the Selective Service Act of 1917, which required all males aged 21–30 to register for military conscription. Goldman saw the decision as an exercise in militarist aggression, driven by capitalism. She declared in Mother Earth her intent to resist conscription, and to oppose US involvement in the war.|$|E
500|$|Director Tom Hooper {{lets his}} actors shine, {{as he did}} so marvelously in Helen Mirren's Elizabeth I and the child-killer drama Longford, but he {{complements}} them, too, with this kind of immediate point of view. And when he does give us panoramic shots from afar – of the Adams farm in Braintree, for example – they're askew, to keep <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classroom mode. At the end of episode 2 [...] Hooper showcases all his directorial strength with one bold choice. When the long-fretting Congress finally decides to break with Britain, he refrains from using any visual or aural tweaks. Upon the announcement, [...] "The resolution carries," [...] the scene remains perfectly silent for one long moment. The terror of responsibility hangs heavily in the room, while a victorious soundtrack surely would have chased it away.|$|E
500|$|Salisbury's blunt {{refusal to}} be part of the Wind of Change caused the Southern Rhodesian military's {{traditional}} British and American suppliers to impose an informal embargo, and prompted Whitehall and Washington to stop sending Southern Rhodesia financial aid around the same time. In June 1964, Douglas-Home informed Smith that Southern Rhodesia would not be represented at the year's Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, despite Salisbury's record of attendance going back to 1932, because of a change in policy to only include representatives from fully independent states. This decision, taken by Britain to preempt the possibility of open confrontation with Asian and black African leaders at the conference, deeply insulted Smith. Lord Malvern equated Britain's removal of Southern Rhodesia's conference seat with [...] "kicking <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth", while Welensky expressed horror at what he described as [...] "this cavalier treatment of a country which has, since its creation, staunchly supported, in every possible way, Britain and the Commonwealth".|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} drivers {{competing}} in the 2010 Chase for the Sprint Cup entered the race optimistic about their chances of winning the championship. Biffle argued that he, Burton, or Stewart were [...] "capable of winning it". Johnson, who already had eighteen previous wins in the Chase, observed that [...] "those 10 races in the Chase is its own world. The people act and react differently under pressure, {{and for the last}} four years we have done a great job in that environment." [...] Hamlin commented, [...] "Reliability is the only thing we need to work on. It's taken <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last three Chases, not being reliable. You have to have it to be the champion." [...] Ray Evernham also opined on Hamlin, [...] "I think Denny knows that he has the talent to win the championship. I think that he's got focus right now and a good, veteran crew chief in Mike Ford. If Toyota gives him the speed, he could be a threat." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the decades}} after the war many of Cardus's earlier heroes and acquaintances died. On Fry's death in 1956 Cardus wrote of him as [...] "A great Englishman, {{measured}} by any standards of occupation, art and civilisation". In 1959, still in harness, Newman {{died at the age}} of 90; Cardus considered him the most outstanding of all music critics, and thought he should have been appointed a Companion of Honour (CH), or even to the Order of Merit. Beecham died on 8 March 1961. Cardus had for some years noted a decline in his old friend's powers, though he had written in 1954, on the occasion of Beecham's 75th birthday, of the debt the music world owed to the conductor: [...] "He led <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Teutonic captivity. He showed us other and more sensitive worlds". After Beecham's death, Cardus organised the publication of a celebratory memoir, as he had done with Kathleen Ferrier. To an extent the departed idols were replaced with new heroes: in music, Herbert von Karajan, Otto Klemperer, Clifford Curzon and Claudio Arrau; in cricket, Keith Miller and Garfield Sobers. Cardus maintained a keen antagonism towards much of contemporary music; discussing Pierre Boulez's Pli selon pli after a performance in 1965, he said he [...] "could not relate the varied succession of aural phenomena to music as my musical intelligence and senses recognise music".|$|E
500|$|Romm's 2010 book, Straight Up, is [...] "largely a {{selection}} of his best blog postings {{over the past few}} years related to climate change issues". TreeHugger describes the book as [...] "a whirlwind tour through the state of climate change, the media that so badly neglects it, the politicians who attempt to address it (and those who obstruct their efforts and ignore [...] science), and the clean energy solutions that could help get <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mess." [...] In 2011, Romm sat on the panel of the Green Car Summit of the Washington Auto Show. His 2012 book, Language Intelligence, concerns persuasion and the effective use of rhetoric. [...] Ed Markey commented on the book, [...] "Joe masterfully ... scripts ways to master the metaphor, and incorporate irony. Solutions the reader can use for speeches, social media, or just winning the debate around the kitchen table." [...] Romm wrote an article for Time magazine in August 2012 using the research from Language Intelligence to analyze whether Mitt Romney or Barack Obama is the more effective communicator. In speeches and lectures since then, Romm has advocated that scientists use the principles of effective communication outlined in the book (instead of their usual, technical, neutral style) to better explain the dangers of, and solutions to, climate change to lay people and the media.|$|E

500|$|Although the Daddies were {{experiencing}} commercial success {{under the guise}} of swing revivalists, having been declared the [...] "leaders" [...] of the movement by Rolling Stone, the band openly contested being labeled a retro act at the exclusion of their dominant ska and punk influences and modernist lyricism. While still vocal supporters of both the swing revival and its bands, the Daddies adamantly tried to disassociate themselves from the swing scene and in particular its nostalgia-based mentality. Perry explained to Spin in July 1998, [...] "it's not our mission to be a swing band. I'm not a guy from the '40s. That's why we play ska and use heavy guitars", noting elsewhere [...] "I can't fully take <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retro classification, but we harp on the fact that we're contemporary music". Thusly, the Daddies avoided touring with swing bands, selecting Latin rock group Ozomatli and ska/soul band The Pietasters as support on their first headlining U.S. tour, and opening for Argentine rock band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on their 1998 North American tour. At one point, the Daddies attempted to arrange a tour with Primus which never materialized; said Perry, [...] "I know there are people who come to our shows who'd like nothing more than for us to play swing 24/7...there are plenty of bands who want to be swing bands and swing bands only. We're trying to find the audience who'll let us write songs and just be who we are".|$|E

[...] Like Sepinwall and Gibson, Frederick praised the {{performance}} by Levi and Dalton, writing, [...] "Chuck's heartbreak and desperation were incredibly poignant throughout the bulk of the episode." [...] Like Gibson, Frederick also praised the scene depicting Chuck's surrender to Vivian, calling it [...] "sniffle-inducing". Frederick continued that Dalton [...] "plays Hartley Winterbottom with a great sincerity and vulnerability." [...] Frederick also called it [...] "a great reward to the fans that the episode didn't cheat <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chuck/Sarah wedding at all." [...] Frederick wrote, [...] "While I'm not blown away by this finale, I still am satisfied with it, because it represents the values we've come to expect from Chuck: the ideas of hope, family, and sticking together {{in the face of the}} most adverse of circumstances." [...] Ryan McGee of The Onion A.V. Club rated the episode a B+ on an A+ to F scale, although criticizing its [...] "mechanics". Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a rating of 9.5 out of 10, a series high alongside season two's [...] "Chuck Versus Santa Claus" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Colonel", season three's [...] "Chuck Versus the Beard" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Subway", and season five's [...] "Chuck Versus the Kept Man" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Goodbye". Goldman wrote, [...] "Chuck had more ups and downs than usual this season, but it ended on a very strong note. With Sarah's life in danger, Chuck and all his friends and family proved they would risk everything to save her, and it made for a very compelling, involving hour." ...|$|E
