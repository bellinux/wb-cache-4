25|$|In {{the first}} of these {{equations}} the ratio tends toward A'n/B'n as z tends toward zero. In the second, the ratio tends toward A'n/B'n as z tends to infinity. This leads <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> first geometric interpretation. If the continued fraction converges, the successive convergents A'n/B'n are eventually arbitrarily close together. Since the linear fractional transformation Τn(z) is a continuous mapping, there must be a neighborhood of z = 0 that is mapped into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of Τn(0) = A'n/B'n. Similarly, there must be a neighborhood of the point at infinity which is mapped into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of Τn(∞) = A'n-1/B'n-1. So if the continued fraction converges the transformation Τn(z) maps both very small z and very large z into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of x, the value of the continued fraction, as n gets larger and larger.|$|E
500|$|In {{describing}} the album, Clarke said, [...] "Technically, it's a Stanley Clarke record, but it's {{very much a}} band-oriented record at the same time". Comparing the album to a ship, he said, [...] "I'd be the one steering the ship and keeping everybody on course. But all hands were definitely on deck, and everyone {{played an important role}} in getting <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> destination". Clarke has said that this will be his last electric album for a while. Clarke co-produced the album with Lenny White who played drums on Clarke's 2009 album Jazz in the Garden.|$|E

500|$|According to {{historian}} Mark McLeod, these postulated {{explanations of}} Định's behaviour are plausible, given the chaos engulfing Vietnam {{at the time}} and the lack of conclusive documentation. However, Định and his supporters asserted their loyalty to the monarch and justified their struggle in his name, {{both before and after the}} signing of the treaty. These declarations show no hint of rejecting Tự Đức's authority nor any reference to a worthier, idealised monarch. Conversely, many of these proclamations display an intense feeling of personal loyalty. A placard that French forces found floating downstream near Định's base in Gò Công asserted: [...] "Gratitude ties <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> king. We will avenge the insults he has received , or we will die for him." [...] One of Định's proclamations to his followers read: [...] "The Emperor does not recognise us, but it is indeed our duty to carry on our struggle.... The Emperor calls us rebels, but in the depth of his heart he cannot help but praise our loyalty. When the day of victory arrives, not only will the Emperor forgive us, he will furthermore grant us all kinds of awards." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1934, Walker, now {{a student}} at the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, testified with Robert Olds, Claire Chennault, Donald Wilson, Harold George and Robert Webster on the {{military}} aspects of aviation before the Howell Commission on Federal Aviation. All were current or former instructors at the Air Corps Tactical School, and all except Chennault were part of the Bomber Mafia. They argued for an independent air force, in contradiction to Army doctrine. Walker told the commission: [...] "unless we create an adequate and separate Air Force, this next war 'will begin in the air and end in the mud'-in the mud and debris of the demolished industries that have brought <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> knees." [...] They were unable to persuade the commission to recommend an independent air force, although it did agree that the Air Corps should be granted greater autonomy within the Army. The commission concluded that [...] "there is ample reason to believe that aircraft have now passed far beyond their former position as useful auxiliaries... An adequate striking force for use against objectives both near and remote is a necessity for a modern army".|$|E

[...] He lambasted US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for signing the Paris Peace Accords, which the communists violated, {{and which he}} regarded as an American abandonment, stating [...] "I never thought that such a good Secretary of State would produce a treaty that would bring <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> death". Thiệu also blamed the local media and foreign broadcasting organisations for lowering {{the morale of the}} military and the population by reporting on the corruption and setbacks of his government.|$|E

2500|$|Ben-Gurion said {{he wanted}} to [...] "concentrate the masses of our people in this country [...] and its environs." [...] When he {{proposed}} accepting the Peel proposals in 1937, which included a Jewish state in part of Palestine, Ben-Gurion told the twentieth Zionist Congress, [...] "The Jewish state now being offered to us is not the Zionist objective. [...] But it can serve as a decisive stage along the path to greater Zionist implementation. It will consolidate in Palestine, within the shortest possible time, the real Jewish force, which will lead <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> historic goal". In a discussion in the Jewish Agency he said that he wanted a Jewish-Arab agreement [...] "on the assumption that after we become a strong force, {{as a result of the}} creation of the state, we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid June 1885, the Western League disbanded, and a mad rush {{developed}} {{to sign the}} players on the Indianapolis roster, a line-up that included McGuire, Sam Thompson, Sam Crane, Chub Collins, Jim Donnelly, Mox McQuery, Gene Moriarty, and Dan Casey. [...] Sam Thompson later told the colorful story of the Detroit Wolverines' acquisition of the Indianapolis players. [...] Detroit sent two representatives (Marsh and Maloney) to Indianapolis, principally to sign the Hoosiers' battery of Larry McKeon and Jim Keenan. [...] The Wolverines were outbid by the Cincinnati Reds for McKeon and Keenan but wound up with the Hoosiers' manager (Bill Watkins) {{and the rest of the}} team's starting lineup. [...] The only catch was that a 10-day waiting period would allow other teams to outbid Detroit. Marsh and Maloney promptly sent the players to Detroit and quartered them in a hotel there. [...] The next morning, the players were told that the team had arranged a fishing trip for them. [...] The players boarded the steamship Annette and enjoyed the first day and night of successful fishing. After three days, the players became suspicious, but the ship captain laughed when asked when they would return to Detroit. [...] As the players became mutinous on the sixth day, the captain admitted he had been ordered to keep them [...] "out at sea" [...] for 10 days. [...] In another account, Thompson described his 10 days aboard the Annette as follows: [...] "We were prisoners, but well cared-for prisoners. Anything in the line of creature comforts you could find packed away on ice. [...] We lived on the best in the market, and spent the rest of the time in fishing and playing poker, chips having very thoughtfully been provided. On the night of the tenth day, at midnight, we were all taken ashore where Watkins met us and signed <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> contracts." ...|$|E
