5|$|Originally an <b>unpaved</b> gravel road, {{the route}} was paved between Belmont and its {{northern}} terminus by 1938.|$|E
5|$|Although NY99 {{was signed}} as a state highway, {{maintenance}} on the route was performed by Franklin County, which designated the roadway as CR26. All of NY99 was initially a gravel road; however, most of the road was paved in the early 1970s {{through the use of}} state funds procured by New York State Senator Ronald Stafford of Plattsburgh. The western and eastern extents of the road were paved soon afterward; however, the road was left <b>unpaved</b> in the vicinity of Loon Lake—a lake near the midpoint of the route—even though the necessary gravel base was applied to the entire highway. The <b>unpaved</b> section deteriorated as a result, and the NY99 designation was removed from the roadway on September26, 1994.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{affected}} area is extremely remote, distributing the relief supplies was difficult. Reaching some villages would require a five-hour drive over <b>unpaved</b> roads, some of which had collapsed or had been covered by landslides during the earthquake. Helicopters were used to provide supplies to some otherwise inaccessible areas.|$|E
5|$|In the Kuril Islands of Russia, Nabi dropped about 75mm (3in) of rain, {{equivalent}} to the monthly average. Gusts reached 83km/h (51mph), weak enough not to cause major damage. During the storm's passage, high waves washed away <b>unpaved</b> roads in Severo-Kurilsk.|$|E
5|$|MS444 was {{designated}} in 1958, as an <b>unpaved</b> road from MS1 to US61. The route became paved by 1960. In 1967, US 61 was rerouted to its east, no longer passing through Duncan. By 1999, US278 {{was designated}}, concurrent with US61 through MS 444's eastern terminus.|$|E
5|$|On May23, 1927, the Department of Highways {{assumed the}} <b>unpaved</b> road between Highway7 at Reece's Corner and Highway3 at Morpeth, via Dresden, Thamesville and Ridgetown as Provincial Highway21; this {{was changed to}} the current King's Highway21 in 1930.|$|E
5|$|When routes were legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, {{what is now}} PA 997 {{between the}} Maryland border and Waynesboro was {{designated}} as part of Legislative Route 44 while {{a section of the}} current route south of Roxbury became part of Legislative Route 264. At this time, an <b>unpaved</b> road ran between Waynesboro, Mont Alto, and Fayetteville. PA 997 was signed in 1928 from Mont Alto, where an unnumbered paved road continued south to Waynesboro, north to US 30 in Fayetteville, following Mont Alto Road. Upon designation, the entire length of PA 997 was paved. The present route between the Maryland border and Waynesboro was designated as part of PA 316, which was paved, while PA 433 was designated onto the <b>unpaved</b> road between Lurgan and Roxbury. PA 333 was designated in 1928 to run from US 30 in Chambersburg northeast to US 11 in Shippensburg, heading north on North Franklin Street and Letterkenny Road to Pleasant Hall before heading west to Upper Strasburg, northeast to Roxbury, east to Newburg, and south to Shippensburg. Upon designation, PA 333 was paved between Chambersburg and Pleasant Hall and Newburg and Shippensburg and was <b>unpaved</b> between Pleasant Hall and Newburg. On February 25, 1929, a bill passed that authorized the state to take over the road between Newburg and McCrea. By 1930, PA 997 was extended south from Mont Alto to PA 16 in Waynesboro, following a paved road. The same year, PA 333 was shifted east to a more direct alignment between Pleasant Hall and Roxbury that was under construction, running concurrent with PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury, while PA 996 was designated onto the paved road between Scotland and US 11 in Green Village. The former alignment of PA 333 became PA 633 (now PA 533) between Pleasant Hall and Upper Strasburg and an unnumbered road between Upper Strasburg and Roxbury. At this time, the road between Mont Alto and Scotland was an unnumbered, <b>unpaved</b> road, the road between Green Village and Culbertson was an unnumbered, paved road, and the road between Roxbury and McCrea was an unnumbered, <b>unpaved</b> road.|$|E
5|$|Wilkins Peak is not gated, {{and it can}} {{be reached}} via an <b>unpaved</b> road known as Wilkins Peak Road that starts on U.S. Route 191 {{southwest}} of Rock Springs, Wyoming. The mountain can also be accessed via another <b>unpaved</b> road that begins in the Scott's Bottom Nature Area in Green River, Wyoming. The peak is accessible year-round, weather permitting. The Green River access road is in worse shape than the Rock Springs side, and it has several road hazards such as steep grades, poor grading, and off-road vehicle traffic. Along with serving radio needs, the peak also is a popular hiking and mountain biking location in the area. There are many smaller roads and trails that spring from the peak that offer varied degrees of challenge.|$|E
5|$|Logging {{settlements}} {{were established}} {{on the northern}} shore of Lake Washington in the 1860s and 1870s, relying primarily on the water for intercity transportation. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was built along the lakefront in 1888, connecting Seattle to the new towns of Bothell and Kenmore. By the 1890s, <b>unpaved</b> logging trails had been completed along Lake Washington and the railroad, reaching as far northeast as Maltby.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1962, SH-132 was {{extended}} to the south, reaching its present-day southern terminus. A minor realignment to the highway occurred in southern Grant County on January 7, 1963, the final change to SH-132's route. By 1963, the portion of highway in Grant County south of US-64 was paved, leaving only a section extending from north of Nash to SH-11 as <b>unpaved.</b> This section was paved by 1967.|$|E
5|$|Paved and <b>unpaved</b> {{trails and}} paths {{are used for}} {{recreational}} and commuter purposes throughout the city. Popular among bicyclists, runners, hikers and recreational walkers, these trails are included in comprehensive plans {{for the city of}} Omaha, the Omaha metro area, Douglas County, and long-distance coordinated plans between the municipalities of southeast Nebraska.|$|E
5|$|The paved version did {{not exactly}} follow the <b>unpaved</b> roads. The dirt route {{passed through the}} {{numerous}} mountain ranges of the great basin with the most difficult being Marjum Canyon. The route was relocated to follow {{the north shore of}} Sevier Lake, which reduced the number of mountain ranges crossed. Although US-50 was moved to yet another alignment, this route remains US-6 today.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification. Points were awarded for reaching {{the top of a}} climb towards the front of the race. Each climb will be categorized as either first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awards more points than the other first-category climbs. At , the Cima Coppi for the 2015 Giro d'Italia was the <b>unpaved</b> Colle delle Finestre.|$|E
5|$|An <b>unpaved</b> {{extension}} of the Bothell Road, traveling along the Sammamish River to Woodinville, Redmond, and Fall City, was designated as {{a branch of the}} Sunset Highway (State Road 2) in 1925. The highway was later paved and incorporated into a longer branch of the Sunset Highway (re-designated as Primary State Highway 2) in 1937, running from Downtown Seattle to Fall City. The branch highway was extended to North Bend after the opening of a Sunset Highway bypass in 1941, using the former mainline road.|$|E
5|$|BMC {{was active}} at {{two of the}} {{traditional}} season-opening races, attaining seventh place with Ballan in the Italian opener Trofeo Laigueglia, and eighth with Quinziato in the Belgian opener, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. Ballan narrowly missed victory a week later at Montepaschi Strade Bianche, finishing second at the line behind Philippe Gilbert. Ballan acknowledged that Gilbert and not he had used the optimal tactics in the final sprint, but felt nonetheless pleased with his early-season form. The two {{had been part of}} a 19-rider group that made all the selections through the sectors of <b>unpaved</b> roads before the finish on cobblestones in Siena.|$|E
5|$|Studies and {{environmental}} assessments into various extensions began {{almost immediately after}} the completion of the route to Newmarket in 1989; it would take over a decade for any northward progression to take place. The completion of the route to Davis Drive was met with scorn as traffic in Newmarket rapidly increased as the bedroom community grew with the new highway access. Municipal officials warned prior to the opening of the route that major traffic delays would be faced along Davis Drive. Then-mayor Ray Twinney began an immediate push to widen Green Lane – at that time an <b>unpaved</b> rural route – into a bypass of the town.|$|E
5|$|The second {{iteration}} has {{its origins}} with {{the formation of}} US-6. In 1937, US-6 was extended west from its former terminus at Greeley, Colorado to Long Beach, California. In eastern Utah the route used the existing alignment of US-50. However, in western Utah the route used an <b>unpaved</b> road through Delta reconnecting with US-50 in Ely. By 1954, this route was fully paved and US-50 was moved to this shorter alignment. With this change US-6/50 ran concurrent from Ely to Grand Junction, Colorado.|$|E
5|$|While passing {{south of}} Jamaica, the storm {{produced}} the heavy rainfall {{in the month}} of July in at least 40 years, which overflowed rivers. Both Kingston and Saint Andrew Parish reported , causing flooding and landslides. The storm washed out roads, most of them <b>unpaved,</b> and one bridge was wrecked; this disrupted the regional transportation. The storm also cut telegraph lines between Kingston and the eastern portion of the island. It later moved across Belize and the Yucatán Peninsula, although no stations reported gale-force winds or low pressures.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, {{what is now}} Route 54 in Delaware existed as an <b>unpaved</b> county road. The {{portion of}} the current route along Millsboro Highway was {{proposed}} as a state highway by 1925. This segment of state highway was completed by 1931, along with the portions from south of Columbia to a point along the state line {{to the east of}} Delmar and between Selbyville and Williamsville. A portion of the route along the state line east of Delmar was paved as a county road. On July 1, 1935, the county-maintained portions of the road in Delaware were taken over by the state. By 1936, the roadway was paved between Williamsville and Fenwick Island. A portion of road to the west of Selbyville was paved by 1939. By 1942, the remainder of the road in Delaware between the Maryland border and south of Columbia and Gumboro and Selbyville were paved.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, {{the road}} between Leonardtown and Mechanicsville and from south of Camp Springs to the Washington, D.C. border was {{completed}} {{as a state}} highway while the sections between south of Beantown and the border between Charles and Prince George's counties and between TB and Camp Springs were under contract. At this time, the road between Point Lookout and Leonardtown, Mechanicsville and Beantown, and the Charles-Prince George's county border and TB were proposed as state highways. By 1915, {{the entire length of}} the state highway between north of Point Lookout and the Washington, D.C. border was completed. This state highway was paved to the northwest of Leonardtown, between north of Morganza and Hughesville, between the Charles-Prince George's county border and north of TB, and from south of Camp Springs to the Washington, D.C. border while the remainder was an <b>unpaved</b> state road.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia {{possesses}} 673 {{airports in}} 2013, ranging from grand international airports to modest <b>unpaved</b> airstrips on remote islands or inland interior areas located throughout the archipelago. In November 2011, Indonesia {{had more than}} 230 conventional airports, most of them operated by Transportation Ministry technical operation units and state-owned PT Angkasa Pura I & II. Major airports are managed by Angkasa Pura; Angkasa Pura I operates 13 airports in Eastern Indonesia, while Angkasa Pura II operates 13 airports in Western Indonesia. After the 2000 aviation deregulation, Indonesian airports endured a surge of passengers, especially catalyzed by the advent of low-cost carriers. According to the Indonesian Transportation Ministry, 9 of the 13 airports managed by PT Angkasa Pura I have exceeded their passenger capacity.|$|E
5|$|SH-132 {{was first}} {{designated}} on July 14, 1956. Initially, the highway began {{at what was}} then SH-38 (present-day SH-45) in Carrier, proceeding north along its present-day route to end at US-64 east of Nash. On May 8, 1958, {{the portion of the}} route concurrent with US-64 into Nash, and from Nash to the Kansas state line north of Manchester, was added. The route did not appear on the official state highway map until the 1959 edition. At this time, portions of the route in Grant County, including from the Garfield–Grant county line to US-64 and a segment between Nash and Manchester, were <b>unpaved.</b> By 1961, the segment of highway north of SH-11 had been paved.|$|E
5|$|SR104 was {{established}} during the 1964 state highway renumbering as {{the successor to}} several state highways: SSH9E between Discovery Bay and Port Gamble, PSH21 between Port Gamble and Kingston, SSH1W in Edmonds, and SSH2B between Edmonds and Lake Forest Park. The highway between Port Gamble and Kingston {{was established}} in 1915 as part of State Road21, which extended south to Bremerton. During {{the creation of the}} Primary and secondary state highways in 1937, State Road21 was re-designated as PSH21 and extended south to Gorst. SSH9E was also established, connecting US101 and PSH9 in Discovery Bay to Port Ludlow, along with SSH1W from US99 and PSH1 in Lynnwood through Edmonds to US99 and PSH1 in Woodway, following the route of an <b>unpaved</b> road built in the 1890s. SSH2B was created in 1937 to serve as a connector between US99 and PSH1 in Shoreline to a branch of PSH2 in Lake Forest Park.|$|E
5|$|The Champs-Élysées in 1855 {{were not}} yet the grand avenue laid out by Baron Haussmann in the 1860s, but an <b>unpaved</b> allée. The public who were {{flocking}} to Offenbach's theatre {{in the summer and}} autumn of 1855 could not be expected to venture there in the depths of a Parisian winter. He cast about for a suitable venue and found the Théâtre des Jeunes Élèves, known also as the Salle Choiseul or Théâtre Comte, in central Paris. He entered into partnership with its proprietor and moved the Bouffes-Parisiens there for the winter season. The company returned to the Salle Lacaze for the 1856, 1857, and 1859 summer seasons, performing at the Salle Choiseul in the winter. Legislation enacted in March 1861 prevented the company from using both theatres, and appearances at the Salle Lacaze were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The {{rift between}} Williams and Patton became {{permanent}} during negotiations {{over the state}} budget in 1999. Patton proposed to Williams a 7-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, with 1cent of every 7 dedicated to counties with the most <b>unpaved</b> roads – usually heavily Republican counties ignored by past Democratic governors. Patton claimed Williams {{told him he had}} 10votes in the Senate for the increase. But gas prices spiked before the measure came to a vote in the Senate, and Williams failed to deliver his votes after the House passed the tax. The administration and key Republican senators reached a compromise that saved Patton's budget with tax changes that were mostly revenue-neutral. Patton believed Williams had deliberately misled him, however, and the two never reconciled.|$|E
5|$|What is now MS 5 {{originally}} existed as an unnumbered <b>unpaved</b> road by 1928. The MS 5 designation {{was assigned}} by 1932 {{for the road}} running from US 78 in Hickory Flat to the Tennessee border in Michigan City, where it connected to SR 18. This road was a gravel road south of Ashland and an earth road north of Ashland. Two years later, the portion north of Ashland became a gravel road. In 1943, the northern terminus of MS 5 was cut back to its current location at US 72, with MS 7 connecting to SR 18 at the Tennessee border. By 1948, the portion of route south of Ashland was paved. The remainder of the route was paved three years later. Since then, the route has not undergone any alignment changes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1898, Dawson's {{population}} rose further to 30,000 as stampeders arrived over the passes. The centre of the town, Front Street, was lined with hastily built buildings and warehouses, together with log cabins and tents spreading out across {{the rest of the}} settlement. There was no running water or sewerage, and only two springs for drinking water to supplement the increasingly polluted river. In spring, the <b>unpaved</b> streets were churned into thick mud and in summer the settlement reeked of human effluent and was plagued by flies and mosquitoes. Land in Dawson was now scarce, and plots sold for up to $10,000 ($8 million) each; prime locations on Front Street could reach $20,000 ($16 million) while a small log cabin might rent for $100 ($2,700) a month. As a result, Dawson's population spread south into the empty Hän village, renaming it Klondike City. Other communities emerged closer to the mines, such as Granville on Dominion Creek and Grand Forks on Bonanza Creek.|$|E
5|$|M-71 {{was formed}} by July 1, 1919 as a spur route from M-21, which ran along Lytle Road, southerly to Durand. Around 1925, a {{realignment}} of M-21 produced changes in M-71. M-21 was rerouted to its current alignment between Owosso and Lennon, and M-71 took over the roadway between Owosso and Corunna. At the same time, M-71 was shifted to run through Vernon. The section of M-71 between Durand and M-78 was transferred to M-78 and M-71 was shortened by 1934. This transfer was reversed in 1935 when M-78 construction was completed. A new section of M-71 was built parallel to the Ann Arbor Railroad between Durand and Corunna in 1938. This construction paved the last remaining <b>unpaved</b> segment of M-71. The section of M-71 south of M-78 into Durand was turned back to local control in early 1939, and M-71 was shortened one final time with {{the completion of the}} M-78 freeway (now I-69) in the area in late 1960 or early 1961. At that time, the eastern terminus was shifted to the freeway interchange instead of the old route of M-78 along Lansing Road.|$|E
5|$|SR 88 {{begins at}} a diamond {{interchange}} with US 60, the Superstition Freeway, in southern Apache Junction. The route follows Idaho Road northward through a residential area with four lanes. Following a junction with Old West Highway, SR 88 turns northeast onto Apache Trail and narrows to two lanes. The route exits {{the city limits}} of Apache Junction, entering desert terrain. Passing a ghost town known as Goldfield, Apache Trail enters Tonto National Forest just northwest of Lost Dutchman State Park. SR 88 nears Canyon Lake south of the Mormon Flat Dam and follows {{a part of the}} southern coast of Canyon Lake. Apache Trail heads away from the Salt River. It passes through the town of Tortilla Flat, becoming an <b>unpaved</b> dirt trail winding eastward through the Superstition Mountains. SR 88 again turns northeast and nears Apache Lake. The route follows the Salt River northeast to the Theodore Roosevelt Dam, near which the route is again paved. SR 88 intersects with SR 188 along the coast of Theodore Roosevelt Lake.|$|E
5|$|Signage for SR 67 {{begins at}} Bright Angel Point along the North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park. ADOT does not officially own {{this section of}} road, but it is signed as SR 67. The road heads north as the Kaibab Plateau North Rim Parkway through {{the small town of}} North Rim, {{surrounded}} by evergreen trees. The parkway enters a small clearing before meeting the park entrance, where ownership by ADOT begins. Heading into Kaibab National Forest on a northward path, the roadway is surrounded by a narrow meadow bordered by evergreen trees. As it passes the nearby Deer Lake, SR 67 meets an <b>unpaved</b> National Forest road. The landscape around the route is crisscrossed by these routes as SR 67 makes several turns, turning back toward the north. The highway, with the new name of Grand Canyon Highway in addition to its other designation, makes several turns as it heads north through the woods. It takes a more northwesterly path as it runs through Coconino County. Near its terminus, the road turns back northeast toward its terminus at US 89A in Jacob Lake.|$|E
5|$|The Apache Trail {{connected}} the Old Spanish Trail where Apache Junction is today and Roosevelt Lake with an <b>unpaved</b> road {{as early as}} 1925, following much of the modern route. By the next year, SR 66 followed the Apache Trail and the Old Spanish Trail was numbered as US 80. The number 88 {{was given to the}} route by 1927, but continued past its current terminus east to US 180 west of Globe. US 60 and US 89 became concurrent with US 80 at the western terminus by 1935, and the US 70 designation was added to the road by 1939. The section of the route from Apache Junction to Canyon Lake was paved in the late 1940s. By 1958, the section east of Roosevelt Dam was paved. The extra designations at SR 88's western terminus were removed by 1971, leaving only the US 60 designation. In 1999, the section east of Roosevelt Dam was renumbered as SR 188, cutting SR 88 back to its current terminus.|$|E
5|$|The Giro's 21 stages {{were divided}} into the {{following}} classifications by race organizers Gazzetta dello Sport: four time trials (three individual and one team), seven flat stages, five mixed stages, and six mountain stages. The race began in the Netherlands, the ninth time in the Giro's history that the race began outside Italy, and the first since 2006's start in Belgium. A short individual time trial and two flat stages were held there. Starting the race away from Italy meant that an early rest day, coming just three days into the 23-day race, was necessary to transfer to Italy. The first stage upon entering Italy was a team time trial, the fifth consecutive year that discipline had featured in the Giro. Stage 7 visited Tuscany and was raced partly on <b>unpaved</b> roads used yearly in the Italian semi-classic Montepaschi Strade Bianche. The course honored Italian cycling legends Gino Bartali, Fausto Coppi, and Costante Girardengo by passing through their hometowns in the first road race stages in Italy.|$|E
5|$|The Sammamish River valley {{was settled}} in the late 19th century and served by the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad, built in 1889 from Bothell to North Bend, {{traveling}} through Redmond, Issaquah, Fall City, and Snoqualmie. By 1902, several wagon roads were built along the railroad, including a road between Fall City and North Bend, which was incorporated into the Sunset Highway when it was designated as a state highway in 1909. The road from Redmond to North Bend {{became part of the}} national Yellowstone Trail in the 1910s, including a section near Redmond that was paved with bricks in 1913. A portion of the Yellowstone Trail, along with <b>unpaved</b> roads from Redmond to Bothell, were designated as a state highway in 1925. The highway was paved in the late 1920s, and was incorporated into the Seattle–Fall City branch of the Sunset Highway (Primary State Highway 2) in 1937. After the opening of the North Bend bypass in 1941, the branch highway was extended to North Bend over the former Sunset Highway.|$|E
5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over <b>unpaved</b> terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{originally}} designated as Route 202 in 1933. By 1934, a road headed due south from Seeley, before turning east through Calexico and curving {{slightly to the}} north and then east again through Bonds Corners. The easternmost portion of the highway was <b>unpaved.</b> By 1938, the road from Coyote Wells east to the then-current routing had been constructed, but was a county road; the entirety of Route 98, which was signed, was either gravel or asphalt. Between 1952 and 1954, the western portion of SR 98 was rerouted onto the county road, moving the western terminus to southwest of Coyote Wells; however, the new portion was not paved. By 1956, the entire highway was paved. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, the highway was officially renumbered as Route 98. I-8 was extended to the western terminus of SR 98 by 1965, and to the eastern terminus of SR 98 by 1970.|$|E
5|$|The {{relocation}} of the livestock market had {{done little to}} resolve the problems of congestion {{in and around the}} market. Many of the mediaeval access routes to the market were too narrow for wheeled transport, and the narrow alleys were also dark, dangerous and mostly <b>unpaved.</b> Although the market had been resurfaced during the 18thcentury, this had been with flint pebble cobblestones which were easily dislodged and trapped refuse. William Chase, editor of the first Norwich Directory, lobbied in the late 18thcentury for civic improvements and a rationalisation of the streets around the market. However, the economy of Norwich depended heavily on the textile industry, which had suffered badly from the loss of export markets during the French Wars, and funds for improvements were limited. By the beginning of the 19thcentury the only significant improvement had been the paving of Gentleman's Walk. In 1805 a number of Improvement Commissions were established to propose solutions to the problems facing the area, but little action was taken. Local councils had no powers to levy rates to fund general civic improvements and as a consequence funds for improvement works had to be raised either through tolls and rents, via public appeals, or through long term borrowing, and the city was initially unable to raise sufficient funds.|$|E
