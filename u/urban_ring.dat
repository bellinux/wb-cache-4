25|$|The <b>Urban</b> <b>Ring</b> is {{a project}} of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, to develop new public {{transportation}} routes that would provide improved circumferential connections among many existing transit lines that project radially from downtown Boston, allowing easier travel between locations outside of downtown. The project corridor passes through various neighborhoods of Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Medford, Somerville, Cambridge, and Brookline. The capital cost for {{this version of the}} plan is estimated at $2.2 billion, with a projected daily ridership of 170,000. Fifty-three percent of the route is either in a bus-only lane, dedicated busway, or tunnel.

This paper aims at analyzing the existence, size, and persistence of leapfrogging in a dynamic urban economic model with endogenous green amenities. We analyze whether incoming households choose to settle at {{the fringe of the}} city or to jump further away depending on their preferences and the structure of the city. We first provide an analytical treatment of the conditions and characteristics under which a first leapfrog occurs and show how the optimal choice is affected {{by the size of the}} city, income, commuting costs, as well as the size of the area where green amenities are considered.

40|$|In China and {{a number}} of other countries, recent years have seen a {{prevailing}} trend in collective and cooperative urban development, transforming individual cities to polycentric metropolis. Such a phenomenon, also termed urban agglomeration by some researchers in China, has gradually become the main body of urbanization and the basic terrain unit in participating international competition and international division of labor. However, the spatial delimitation of urban agglomeration has been historically heavily influenced by subjective administrative instruction, as opposed to being primarily driven by radiation effects by regional central cities. To better delimitate the urban agglomeration sphere in China and other fast-developing areas, this work seeks to scientifically assess and comprehensively delimitate the spatial patterns of regional central cities' radiation through quantitative analysis and modeling. Zhengzhou, a typical regional central city in central China is chosen as the study case. First, it makes a modification to the traditional gravity model by constructing a radiation quality index (RQI) and integrating distances representing commuter traffic, economic development gap, and cultural psychological factors. Subsequently, a comprehensive delimitation is derived that demarcates and describes Zhengzhou's urban radiation toward 42 neighboring cities by applying the radiation field intensity model, radiation effect function, and judgment vectors of the urban radiation ring-layer model. The chief findings are that Zhengzhou's radiation effect is not prominent compared to other similar provincial capital-level cities. There is no distinct psychological or spatial differentiation between Zhengzhou and its 42 neighboring cities. The economic distance between Zhengzhou and other cities has been stable, and has even shrunk, whereas there are notable differences among fixed range ring patterns. The interaction forces between Zhengzhou and neighboring cities have increased, and radiation field intensity of Zhengzhou has been expanded to outer rings. However, some cities along the provincial boundary received very limited influence from Zhengzhou, and are significantly more influenced by other radiation sources. In 2001 and 2009, there were 26 and 24 cities that fell in Zhengzhou's <b>urban</b> radiation <b>rings,</b> respectively, whereas only seven cities were included in the core and primary radiation ring. This list of seven cities excluded Luohe City, in spite of its administrative inclusion within Zhengzhou. Zhengzhou's <b>urban</b> radiation <b>ring</b> contracts in its southern and western quadrants, whereas it expands in the eastern and northern quadrants. This finding prompts the authors to advocate the city of Zhengzhou to prioritize on expanding its radiation to the southeastern area around the Zhongyuan Urban Agglomeration. Such balanced development could prove beneficial to not only Zhengzhou City, but also the entire Henan Province. 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|R
50|$|According to {{the chronicle}} of Johann Stumpf from 1548, {{the old town}} {{originally}} consisted of a village square, the church and its cemetery, the town hall, the inn, the archive tower {{and a number of}} scattered wooden houses.

Based upon discussion on the principal and significance of EE assessment in urban industrial concentration areas, an empirical study is conducted in Fengtai district, Beijing, to elaborate the idea from three aspects: socio-economic contribution, environmental load, and environmental risk.

40|$|Abstract: This paper investigates how {{the extent}} and {{configuration}} of Chinese road and railroad networks has shaped the spatial transformation and degree of compactness of Chinese urban regions in the last 20 years, {{a period in which}} center cities were experiencing strong population inflows but relative losses of industry to the urban periphery. We find strong evidence that the presence of radial roads and ring roads outside of the central city reduce central city population density. However radial roads have no effect on the spatial distribution of economic activity (GDP) in <b>urban</b> regions, though <b>ring</b> roads outside of center cities may contribute to industrial decentralization. Rather, in a country where inter-city trade relies heavily on rails, rail networks have significant impacts {{on the extent to which}} economic activity decentralizes.

40|$|This {{study of}} the spatial {{concentration}} of the headquarters of exchange-listed companies suggests that the relevancy of the "efficiency parameter" of agglomeration theory still holds in explaining the location of headquarters, especially when the production function is reinterpreted as a productivity function.

Across industries, {{a high degree of}} clustering is found: 40 % of the nation's headquarters were found in twenty counties. Cluster analysis suggests grouping patterns for headquarters; discriminant analysis confirms the uniqueness of these spatial clustering patterns across 229 urban counties. For certain industries, the clustering occurs within small areas. The headquarters of these spatially-correlated groups of firms money and media, gas and electric, business services, and machining technology were mapped at the county and zipcode level for counties within major metropolitan areas.
