40|$|Live fish {{recognition}} {{is one of}} the most crucial elements of fisheries survey applications where vast amount of data are rapidly acquired. Different from general scenarios, challenges to underwater image recognition are posted by poor image quality, uncontrolled objects and environment, as well as difficulty in acquiring representative samples. Also, most existing feature extraction techniques are hindered from automation due to involving human supervision. Toward this end, we propose an <b>underwater</b> <b>fish</b> recognition framework that consists of a fully unsupervised feature learning technique and an error-resilient classifier. Object parts are initialized based on saliency and relaxation labeling to match object parts correctly. A non-rigid part model is then learned based on fitness, separation and discrimination criteria. For the classifier, an unsupervised clustering approach generates a binary class hierarchy, where each node is a classifier. To exploit information from ambiguous images, the notion of partial classification is introduced to assign coarse labels by optimizing the "benefit" of indecision made by the classifier. Experiments show that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy on both public and self-collected <b>underwater</b> <b>fish</b> images with high uncertainty and class imbalance.

40|$|<b>Underwater</b> <b>fish</b> of {{the class}} Batoidea, {{commonly}} known as rays and skates, use large cartilaginous wings to propel them-selves through the water. This motion is of great interest in bioinspired robotics as an alternative propulsion mechanism. Prior research has focused primarily on the oscillating kinemat-ics used by some species which resembles flapping; this study in-vestigates undulatory motion induced by propagating sinusoidal waves along the fin. An analytical model of undulatory kine-matics is presented and correlated with biological literature, and the model is then simulated via unsteady computational fluid dynamics and multiparticle collision dynamics. A bioinspired robot, Batoid Underwater Robotics Testbed (BURT), was devel-oped to test the kinematics of the undulating propulsion system proposed.

25|$|Fish {{are exposed}} to large oxygen {{fluctuations}} in their aquatic environment since the inherent properties of water can result in marked spatial and temporal differences in the concentration of oxygen (see oxygenation and <b>underwater).</b> <b>Fish</b> respond to hypoxia with varied behavioral, physiological, and cellular responses {{in order to maintain}} homeostasis and organism function in an oxygen-depleted environment. The biggest challenge fish face when exposed to low oxygen conditions is maintaining metabolic energy balance, as 95% of the oxygen consumed by fish is used for ATP production through the electron transport chain. Therefore, hypoxia survival requires a coordinated response to secure more oxygen from the depleted environment and counteract the metabolic consequences of decreased ATP production at the mitochondria. This article is a review of the effects of hypoxia on all aspects of fish, ranging from behavior down to genes.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a rapid and {{efficient}} fish tracking method suitable for real world automatic <b>underwater</b> <b>fish</b> observation. Based on fish tracking, biologists are able to observe fish and their ecological environment. A distributed real-time underwater video stream system has been developed in Taiwan for large-scale, long-term ecological observation. In addition, not only does the system archive video data, but also incorporates data analysis. However, it is difficult to discriminate moving fish from drift water plants due to the severe drift of water plants caused by the water flow in real world <b>underwater</b> environments. Thus, <b>fish</b> tracking is complicated in unconstrained water. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a bounding-surrounding boxes method, which enables integration with state-of-the-art tracking methods for fish tracking in this paper. According to the method, fixing cameras must be used so that the moving fish are classified as foreground objects and are tracked, whereas the drifting water plants are classified as the background objects and are removed from the tracked objects. It enables the efficient, rapid removal of irrelevant information (non-fish objects) from large-scale fish video data. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to achieve high accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- It is {{important}} to get information about obstacles to avoid collision for a natural and smooth movement for fish robots. In this paper, we propose an IR sensor-based measurement system which gets information about obstacles for <b>underwater</b> <b>fish</b> robots. Due to complexity and space restriction, IR distance sensors are installed instead of cameras or sonar systems. Much importance {{is given to the}} nearby obstacles than those in the distance. A scanning IR sensor and two fixed IR sensors are used in our proposed system to get the pattern information of the obstacles in water. By analyzing the IR sensor data, the estimated shapes of obstacles are recognized. Trajectory control for underwater robots should be designed based on the estimated results of the shapes. Our experimental results show that fish robots, which use our proposed sensor system, make successful movement avoiding collision through channels...|$|R
