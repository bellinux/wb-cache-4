5000|$|Walter {{should be}} read as {{requiring}} {{no more than that}} the algorithm be [...] "applied in any manner to physical elements or process steps," [...] provided that its application is circumscribed by more than a field of <b>use</b> <b>limitation</b> or non-essential post-solution activity. Thus, if the claim would be [...] "otherwise statutory," [...] albeit inoperative or less useful without the algorithm, the claim likewise presents statutory subject matter when the algorithm is included.

While General Talking Pictures did not clearly resolve this question, many licensors have assumed that sales by a licensee outside of its licensed field are unauthorized altogether and are therefore non-exhaustive regardless of the purchaser’s knowledge of the field of use limitation."

5000|$|For a {{comparative}} perspective, {{it is also}} essential to {{understand the difference between}} [...] "fair use" [...] and [...] "fair dealing". In jurisdictions that follow the latter approach, the specific purposes listed down within fair dealing are the only ones for which [...] "fair dealing" [...] is permitted. It cannot be done for any other purpose irrespective of how [...] "fair" [...] the other purpose is. The specific provisions and purposes mentioned within fair dealing are not mere examples of how the judges can enforce the fair dealing exception. Fair use, on the other hand, is much broader in scope as it only provides guidelines using which the Judges can decide whether a particular use is fair or not. This implies that unlike in fair dealing, the fair use exemption is not exhaustive and the Judges are free to use their discretion to permit anything that could qualify as [...] "fair" [...] for them. The fair use approach is followed in the United States whereas the fair dealing approach is followed in India. Understanding the difference between these two is crucial as they define the limits of judicial discretion in copyright cases. Section 107 of the US Copyright statute deals with the fair <b>use</b> <b>limitation.</b> It mentions certain situations to which fair use exception would apply but in doing so it uses the words [...] "purposes such as", thereby making it amply clear that the list is merely indicative and not exhaustive. It also enlists the 4 factors that have to be considered while determining whether the exception would apply. These factors are as follows: ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The antibiotics, {{streptomycin}} sulfate and oxytetracycline, are used widely for fire blight suppression in the Pacific Northwest {{region of the}} United States. The efficacy of streptomycin, however, is compromised by widespread streptomycin-resistance in E. amylovora populations, and oxytetracycline is only partially effective. Consequently, for several years, the aminoglycoside antibiotic, kasugamycin (Kasumin 2 L and 10 L), was evaluated as an alternative material for fire blight control. Research focused on development of kasugamycin-use strategies with potential to delay the development of pathogen-resistance compared to use of kasugamycin alone. The first strategy involved <b>use</b> <b>limitation</b> through integration with biological control. Pantoea vagans was applied at 30 and 70...|$|E
