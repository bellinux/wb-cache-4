60|$|Two persons {{for whom}} the table would not move laid their hands on it firmly and flatly. Two others (for whom it danced) just touched {{the hands of the}} former pair. Any {{pressure}} or push from the <b>upper</b> <b>hands</b> would be felt, of course, by the under hands. No such pressure was felt, yet the table began to rotate. In another experiment with another subject, the pressure was felt (indeed the owner of the <b>upper</b> <b>hands</b> was conscious of pressing), yet the table did not move. These experiments are, physiologically, curious, but, of course, they demonstrate nothing. Muscles can move the table, muscles can apparently act without the consciousness of their owner, therefore the movement is caused, or may be irrefutably said to be caused, by unconscious muscular action.|$|R
