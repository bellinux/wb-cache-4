5|$|As {{a result}} of {{relatively}} intense language contact, Central Atlas Tamazight has a large stratum of Arabic loans. Many borrowed words in Berber also have native synonyms, e.g. /lbab/ or /tiflut/ 'door', the latter <b>used</b> <b>more</b> in rural areas. The contact was unequal, as Moroccan Arabic has not borrowed as much from Berber languages, though Berber has contributed to Moroccan and Algerian Arabics' very reduced vowel systems.|$|E
5|$|British {{aircraft}} received fighter {{control from}} warships in San Carlos Water, although its effectiveness was limited by their being stationed {{close to the}} islands, which severely limited {{the effectiveness of their}} radar. The differences in tactics and training between 800 Squadron and 801 Squadron has been a point of criticism, suggesting that the losses of several ships were preventable had Sea Harriers from Hermes been <b>used</b> <b>more</b> effectively.|$|E

5|$|From Jabiya, on Khalid’s suggestion, Abu Ubaidah {{ordered the}} Muslim army to {{withdraw}} to the plain of the Yarmouk River, {{which had a}} good supply of pasture and water and where cavalry could be <b>used</b> <b>more</b> effectively. Abu Ubaidah, in a council of war, transferred the supreme command of the Muslim forces to Khalid, who acted as a field commander in the battle and was the mastermind of the annihilation of the Byzantine army.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle had lost its defensive role, and was <b>used</b> <b>more</b> as a military prison than a military fortification.

In some studies, use of these medications {{was associated with a}} worse prognosis; although it is unclear whether this might be because the drugs themselves actually cause harm, or because they are <b>used</b> <b>more</b> often in persons with a poorer prognosis. There is a possibility of a gastric hemorrhage due to stress ulcers.|$|E
5|$|Prosody is {{the study}} of the meter, rhythm, and {{intonation}} of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be <b>used</b> <b>more</b> specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.|$|E

5|$|The Zelda story {{setting was}} {{initially}} supposed to include technological elements, {{such as a}} time-travelling main character and a Triforce made of electronic circuits.

5|$|The {{earliest}} medieval cannon, the pot-de-fer, had bulbous, vase-like shape, and was <b>used</b> <b>more</b> {{for psychological}} effect than for causing physical damage. The later culverin was transitional between the handgun {{and the full}} cannon, and {{was used as an}} anti-personnel weapon. During the 15th century, cannon advanced significantly, so that bombards were effective siege engines. Towards the end of the period, the cannon gradually replaced siege enginesamong other forms of aging weaponryon the battlefield.|$|E

In the early episodes of the series, each {{character}} was handled by a different key animator, meaning that skating style of the characters differed from each other. In the skating scenes, the sound effects were changed to match each venue, according to the building's capacity and crowd size. The skating sounds for each sequence were recorded separately. No stock sounds {{were used for the}} sequences because each part sounds different, and no footage of professional skaters was used because the music in the programmes normally muffles the sounds. Thus the sounds used were recorded and performed by series choreographer Miyamoto, and each skating sequence is unique to the program.|$|E
