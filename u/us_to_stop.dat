25|$|This {{manifesto}} {{is for all}} of you. It {{is absolutely}} necessary for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> at the earliest possible time the nameless oppositions being perpetrated on {{the sons of the}} country who are now suffering the brutal punishment and tortures in jails, and because of this please let all the brethren know that on Saturday, the 29th of the current month, the revolution shall commence according to our agreement. For this purpose, it is necessary for all towns to rise simultaneously and attack Manila at the same time. Anybody who obstructs this sacred ideal of the people will be considered a traitor and an enemy, except if he is ill; or is not physically fit, in which case he shall be tried according to the regulations we have put in force.|$|E
25|$|The self {{is found}} to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the {{volition}} of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would not allow <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} renewed {{for a second}} season in May 2014, a third in May 2015, a fourth in March 2016, and a fifth in May 2017. In September 2016, {{discussing}} the eventual end of the series, Tancharoen said, [...] "You always just forge ahead. Until someone tells <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> {{we will continue to}} move forward." [...] Jed Whedon added, [...] "There are always ideas {{in the back of your}} mind for how you'd wrap it up when they say, 'That's it guys,' but we're not there just yet." [...] By May 2017, Bell noted they had [...] "a sense of how we'd like the show to end when it ends. We just need to know when that time is coming so we can build to it properly." [...] Jed Whedon continued, [...] "Our goal is to know ahead of time, because we would love to land the story in a way that's satisfying".|$|E

500|$|In November 1962 Sihanouk {{called on}} the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> {{supporting}} the Khmer Serei, which he believed they had been secretly doing through the CIA. He threatened to reject all economic aid from the US if they {{failed to respond to}} his demands, a threat he later carried out on 19November 1963. At the same time, Sihanouk also nationalised the country's entrepot trade, banking sector, and distillery industries. To oversee policy and regulatory matters on the country's entrepot trade, he set up the National Export-Import Corporation and Statutory Board, better known as [...] "SONEXIM". When Sarit, Diem, and US president John F. Kennedy died in November and December 1963, Sihanouk rejoiced over their deaths, as he accused them of attempting to destabilise Cambodia. He organised concerts and granted civil servants extra leave time to celebrate the occasion. When the US government protested Sihanouk's celebrations, he responded by recalling the Cambodian ambassador to the US, Nong Kimny.|$|E
2500|$|Eulogizing the Rev. Clementa Pinckney on June 26, 2015, before 5,000 congregants at the College of Charleston, President Barack Obama {{acknowledged}} that the shooting had catalyzed a broad movement, backed by Republicans and Democrats, to remove the flag from official public display. [...] "Blinded by hatred, [...] failed to comprehend what Reverend Pinckney so well understood: the power of God's grace," [...] Obama said. [...] "By taking down that flag we express God's grace.

2500|$|Knowing-that is our conscious, {{step-by-step}} {{problem solving}} abilities. We use these skills when we encounter a difficult problem that requires <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> {{step back and}} search through ideas one at time. At moments like this, the ideas become very precise and simple: they become context free symbols, which we manipulate using logic and language. These are the skills that Newell and Simon had demonstrated with both psychological experiments and computer programs. Dreyfus agreed that their programs adequately imitated the skills he calls [...] "knowing-that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Other {{speakers}} included {{former governor}} Gary Johnson and NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake. Drake addressed the crowd, saying in part, [...] "It's time {{to roll back}} the surveillance state ... It {{is time for the}} <b>U.S.</b> government <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> watching us".|$|R

But he refused to do what the senior person told him. [...] "For the past 108 days, the Alliance has protested together under hardship, while another group of people has remained in comfort. They can't just suddenly ask <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> protesting," [...] he told the assembled forces. Addressing supporters on ASTV, Sondhi said, [...] "If we have to die today, I am willing to die. This is a fight for dignity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gingrich {{was one of}} the 71 {{co-sponsors}} of a bill {{to reinstate}} the Fairness Doctrine after the Federal Communications Commission stopped enforcing the rule in 1987. In 2006, he indicated that free speech might need to be curtailed to fight terrorism, saying [...] "Either before we lose a city or, if we are truly stupid, after we lose a city, we will adopt rules of engagement that use every technology we can find to break up their capacity to use the Internet, to break up their capacity to use free speech, and to go after people who want to kill <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> them from recruiting people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three days later, in the 1986-02-18 Hackney Gazette, Tim Cooper took up Akass's story. He went to Beevers Nursery {{and asked}} parents there what their {{reaction}}s, in turn, {{were to the}} Hackney council statement, itself {{a reaction to the}} claim that Beevers had issued a ban. Cooper's story reported one of the nursery playleaders as saying [...] "We're run by parents and if they want <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> singing it, we would. But there have been no complaints so far, though someone once suggested it could be racist."

5000|$|Almost 250 people {{participated in}} a Quds Day rally held in Chicago.

2500|$|The Mexican {{government}} {{accused the}} U.S. and independent Texas of encouraging Comanche raids, especially by trading guns to the Comanche {{in exchange for}} horses. In 1826, a Mexican official appealed to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the [...] "traders in blood who put instruments {{of death in the}} hands of those barbarians." [...] In 1835, the state of Chihuahua, ravaged by Apache as well as Comanche raids, offered a bounty of 100 pesos (about U.S.$100) for each scalp of a hostile Indian man and lesser amounts for women and children. American and Indian, primarily Delaware and Shawnee, scalp hunters killed many Apache and peaceful Indians for the bounty over the next few years, but apparently had little success in hunting down and killing Comanches.|$|E

2500|$|The Pakistani Taliban claimed {{responsibility}} for the attacks in a statement released later {{on the day of the}} attack. The group claimed it was a retaliation for the fatal US drone strike against Waliur Rehman, a Taliban commander, who was killed on 29 May 2013. The group's spokesperson Ehsanullah Ehsan said ″Through this killing we gave a message to international community to ask <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> drone strikes″. Another militant group Jundallah, notorious for organising attacks on Pakistani Shi'ites, had also previously {{claimed responsibility}}. [...] Throughout the investigations and their aftermath, the Pakistani authorities were silent as to long-term promotion of terrorism and jihad by the Pakistani government itself, especially by various arms of the Pakistan Army such as the Inter-Services Intelligence, which have significantly contributed to the socio-cultural context in Pakistan within which terrorists are often seen as 'heroes' and 'patriots'.|$|E
