The way <b>urban</b> <b>fabrics</b> and its environment, the data processing techniques, and the weather conditions affect the radar signal was examined and discussed. It was found that large effects originate from the geometry of urban features, as well as their orientation relative to the spacecraft orbit.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{reconstruction of the}} <b>urban</b> <b>fabrics</b> has been the object of several studies and research. To lead to the acquisition of the geometry of architectural or urban sets, some of the studies were based on photogrammetry or vision by computer. Others use a laser providing a 3 D scatter plot. Also, other research, were directed towards the development of CAD software. And some other research, carry on the automatic generation of 3 D morphological representation resting on the exploitation of a base of architectural knowledge. The majority of these methods use expensive tools and complicated and long reconstruction processes. Our method, contrarily to previous works, uses two-dimensional documents, primarily cadastral maps digitalized on computer.

The layout further includes several tree lined streets, addressed by the narrow fronted commercial buildings typical of Irish towns, though with many here remaining of a singular refinement and charm.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine spatiality of {{transitions}} by combining aspects of urban form to policy analysis. It aims to increase understanding of how urban form relates to potential effects of transport policies on urban mobility transitions. Design/methodology/approach – Novel analytical framework combines concepts of path dependence, path creation and path destabilisation to three <b>urban</b> <b>fabrics</b> (walking, transit and car cities), to study the transition potential of recent transport policy measures influencing the Helsinki region in Finland. Findings – Analysis showed that the potential effects of single policy measures often reach over all three <b>urban</b> <b>fabrics.</b> A policy measure may simultaneously contain elements of both path dependence, i. e. support for fossil-fuel based private motoring in the car city and path creation, i. e. stimulation of innovations in transit or walking cities. Policy outcomes are often conditional on implementation of other policy measures. For transition governance, this indicates that policy mixes should both destabilise car cities and enforce path creation in walking and transit cities. Research limitations/implications – Findings are based on potential rather than evaluated impacts and a limited sample of policies. Practical implications – Findings support previous research on the importance of policy coherence: multiple policies and coherence across domains are important. They demonstrate the usefulness of analysing recent or planned policies from the transition perspective. Originality/value – The paper provides novel insights by combining policy analysis to the spatial model of overlapping <b>urban</b> <b>fabrics.</b> In addition, it applies the concepts of path dependence, path creation and path destabilisation in a new way...|$|R

40|$|The {{relation}} between the global and the local is the traditional concern of space syntax. A ‘form’ and a ‘structure’ of <b>urban</b> <b>fabrics</b> can be represented in images and graph measures using space syntax techniques and these images and measures correlate with observations of how people use and organize those <b>urban</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The implication {{is that it is}} the {{relation between}} scales which is crucial to understanding how people act in the city and prepare the city for action. The city fabric is (and this has been suggested before) an apparatus for relating scales in action, and one which people use in not yet clearly specified ways in order to do things. Part of the project of space syntax is to build ever more refined descriptions of this constructed apparatus in order to understand better how this all works and to suggest better ways of planning and designing cities. One of the chief challenges facing city-building today is to understand how to plan and design at much larger scales than those of the central urban neighbourhood and area, and in order to do this we need to be clearer about what it is space syntax is actually doing at the scales of central <b>urban</b> <b>fabrics</b> so we can extend this understanding plausibly to descriptions of large metropolitan and megacity regions. The roles of technologies and technical systems in creating the kinds of spaces we act in is a topic of research and debate in discussion about urban form today, and is one we need to address more clearly in space syntax. I discuss these issues in order to show how we may adapt an interpretation of urban technical systems and their relations with one another, and the way this relates to human action, in order to build plausible descriptions of continuous urban surfaces.

25|$|The late antique <b>urban</b> <b>fabric</b> {{suffered}} {{considerably from}} the Arab attacks and the concomitant decline of urbanization, {{but most of}} the cities in the interior of the theme, i.e. in Phrygia and Pisidia, survived, albeit in a reduced form. The cities of eastern Cappadocia (the former province of Cappadocia Secunda), however, which bordered the Caliphate, were practically destroyed, as was Antioch in Pisidia. The foundation of the new kleisourai along the eastern frontier, especially Cappadocia, in the 9th century, meant that Arab raids henceforth were absorbed there, and seldom reached the Anatolic Theme's territory. Apart from Caliph al-Mu'tasim's great invasion against Amorium in 838, attacks that penetrated into the Anatolics' territory are reported for the year 878, when the thematic troops successfully defended Mistheia, and again in 888, 894 and 897, always in the southeastern portion of the theme around Iconium. The 10th century was largely peaceful, with the exception of yet another sack of Amorium in 931 and a raid that reached Iconium in 963.|$|E
25|$|Rowe and Koetter were not, however, championing collage in the {{pictorial}} sense, much less seeking {{the types of}} disruptions of meaning that occur with collage. Instead, they were looking to challenge the uniformity of Modernism and saw collage with its non-linear notion of history {{as a means to}} reinvigorate design practice.

Rowe was a member of the so-called Texas Rangers, a group of architects who taught at the University of Texas for a while. Another member of that group was Bernhard Hoesli, a Swiss architect who went on to become an important educator at the ETH-Zurirch. Whereas for Rowe, collage was more a metaphor than an actual practice, Hoesli actively made collages as part of his design process. He was close to Robert Slutzky, a New York-based artist, and frequently introduced the question of collage and disruption in his studio work.|$|E
25|$|Caro's {{depiction}} of Moses's life gives him full credit for his early achievements, showing, for example, how he conceived and created Jones Beach and the New York State Park system, but also shows how Moses's desire for power {{came to be}} more important to him than his earlier dreams. Moses is blamed for having destroyed more than a score of neighborhoods by building 13 expressways across New York City and by building large urban renewal projects with little regard for the <b>urban</b> <b>fabric</b> or for human scale. Yet the author is more neutral in his central premise: the city would have developed much differently without Moses. Other US cities were doing the same thing as New York in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s; Boston, San Francisco, and Seattle, for instance, each built highways straight through their downtown areas. The New York City architectural intelligentsia of the 1940s and 1950s, who largely believed in such prophets of the automobile as Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, had supported Moses. Many other cities, like Newark, Chicago, and St. Louis, also built massive, unattractive public housing projects.|$|E
40|$|Traffic {{noise in}} cities has serious {{effects on the}} inhabitants. Well-known effects are {{annoyance}} and sleep disturbance, but long-term health effects such as cardiovascular disease have also been related to traffic noise. The spatial distribution of traffic noise in a city {{is related to the}} distributions of traffic volume and urban density, and also to urban form. This relation is investigated by means of numerical calculations for two cities, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and for various idealized <b>urban</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The concept of urban traffic elasticity is introduced to relate local population density to local vehicle kilometers driven on the urban road network. The concept of Spacematrix is used to represent urban density and urban form. For the two cities it is found that the average sound level in an urban area decreases with increasing population and building density. The results for idealized <b>urban</b> <b>fabrics</b> show that the shape of buildings blocks has a large effect on the sound level at the least-exposed façade (quiet façade) of a building, and a smaller effect on the sound level at the most-exposed façade. Sound levels at quiet facades are in general lower for closed building blocks than for open blocks such as strips. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe streets’ network {{shapes the}} urban layout that {{structures}} the city space and delineates homogeneous urban areas. Structural {{analysis of the}} streets’ network is very useful because it usually produces additional semantic information (about urban dynamics). This allows the enrichment of spatial data. The topological and/or geometric characteristics of the network can be analyzed using some graph theory algorithms. The aim of this work is to perform some characterization of the <b>urban</b> <b>fabrics</b> using exclusively the streets’ network as input data. Indeed, the structural properties of the streets’ network create several effects such as continuity, separation, centrality, proximity, connectivity, symmetry, and adjacency into the urban space. We work on an urban primal graph where streets are considered as edges and streets’ intersections are considered as nodes. On {{the basis of this}} real urban graph, we implement two additional artificial graphs. The first one is a “Delaunay triangulated network” and the second one is a “minimum spanning tree”. These graphs correspond to two extreme network morphologies delimiting a morphological continuum. The three graphs are then analyzed using shortest path algorithms. They all have been processed on both a topological and a geometric (weighting each edge by its length) ways so as to extract some structural and multi-centrality indicators (closeness and betweenness centralities). The results can produce semantic information on the structure of the <b>urban</b> <b>fabrics.</b> They allow us to emphasize some specific morphological urban structures (organic areas, suburban tree structures) and some urban salient features (main roads and ring roads) ...|$|R
