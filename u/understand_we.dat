[...] Similarly, he was one of nine Republican senators who voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 at the end of the year. [...] By early 2014, McCain's apostasies were enough that the Arizona Republican Party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been [...] "disastrous and harmful". [...] McCain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of Obama's foreign policy, however, and in June 2014, following major gains by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, decried what he saw as a U.S. failure to protect its past gains in Iraq and called on the president's entire national security team to resign. [...] McCain said, [...] "Could all this have been avoided? ... The answer is absolutely yes. If I sound angry it's because I am angry." ...|$|E

2500|$|Against {{criticism}} that these cases {{were based on}} circumstantial evidence, Fitzgerald responded: [...] "People now know that if you're part of a corrupt conduct, where one hand {{is taking care of}} the other and contracts are going to people, you don't have to say the word 'bribe' out loud.

2500|$|... "A {{people that}} {{suffered}} for 2,000 years, {{that went through}} the Holocaust, arrives at its patrimony but is thrust into a renewed round of bloodshed, that is perhaps the road to annihilation. In terms of cosmic justice, that's terrible. It's far more shocking than what happened in 1948 to {{a small part of}} the Arab nation that was then in Palestine...We are the greater victims in the course of history and we are also the greater potential victim. Even though we are oppressing the Palestinians, we are the weaker side here. We are a small minority in a large sea of hostile Arabs who want to eliminate us.
