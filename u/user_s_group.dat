METHODS: A subtotal hepatectomy with < 60 mL blood loss and without hepatic pedicle occlusion was performed. The mesenteric venous inflow was diverted through a mesocaval shunt (MCS) constructed using the prepared left renal vein with an end-to-side running suture of 5 - 0 proline. All 21 animals that underwent subtotal hepatectomy and/or MCS were divided into three groups. In the 15 % group, the residual volume was 14 %- 19 % of total liver volume (TLV); in the 15 %+ <b>S</b> <b>group,</b> the residual volume was also 14 %- 19 % of TLV with a mesocaval shunt (MCS); and in the 10 %+ <b>S</b> <b>group,</b> the residual volume was 8 %- 13 % of TLV with an MCS. In the three groups, the intraoperative portal vein pressure (PVP) and portal vein flow (PVF) were monitored and compared at laparotomy and 1 h post-hepatectomy. The survival rate, sinusoidal endothelial damage, tissue analysis, and serum analysis were investigated among the three groups. RESULTS: The percentage residual liver volume was 15. 9 %, 16. 1 % and 11. 8 % in the 15 %, 15 %+ S, 10 %+ <b>S</b> <b>groups,</b> respectively. After hepatectomy, PVF and portal-to-arterial flow ratio in the 15 %+ <b>S</b> <b>group</b> significantly decreased and hepatic artery flow (HAF) per unit volume significantly increased, compared {{to those in the}} 15 % group. The PVP in the 15 %+ <b>S</b> <b>group</b> and 10 %+ <b>S</b> <b>group</b> increased slightly from that measured at laparotomy; however, in the 15 % group, the PVP increased immediately and significantly above that observed in the other two groups. The 14 -d survival rates were 28. 5 %, 85. 6 %, and 14. 2 % in the 15 %, 15 %+ S, and 10 %+ <b>S</b> <b>groups,</b> respectively. In the 15 %+ <b>S</b> <b>group,</b> the shunts effectively attenuated injury to the sinusoidal endothelium, and the changes in the serum and tissue analysis results were significantly reduced compared to those in the 15 % and 10 %+ <b>S</b> <b>groups.</b> CONCLUSION: MCS can decompress the portal vein and so attenuate liver injury from hyperperfusion, and make extreme or marginal hepatectomy safer...|$|R

40|$|The conical-domain {{model is}} a {{computational}} model, now undergoing development, for estimating ionospheric delays of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Relative to the standard ionospheric delay model described below, the conical-domain model offers improved accuracy. In the absence of selective availability, the ionosphere is the largest source of error for single-frequency users of GPS. Because ionospheric signal delays contribute to errors in GPS position and time measurements, satellite-based augmentation systems (SBASs) {{have been designed to}} estimate these delays and broadcast corrections. Several national and international SBASs are currently in various stages of development to enhance the integrity and accuracy of GPS measurements for airline navigation. In the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) of the United States, slant ionospheric delay errors and confidence bounds are derived from estimates of vertical ionospheric delay modeled on a grid at regularly spaced intervals of latitude and longitude. The estimate of vertical delay at each ionospheric grid point (IGP) is calculated from a planar fit of neighboring slant delay measurements, projected to vertical using a standard, thin-shell model of the ionosphere. Interpolation on the WAAS grid enables estimation of the vertical delay at the ionospheric pierce point (IPP) corresponding to any arbitrary measurement of a user. (The IPP of a given <b>user</b> <b>s</b> measurement is the point where the GPS signal ray path intersects a reference ionospheric height.) The product of the interpolated value and the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> thin-shell obliquity factor provides an estimate of the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> ionospheric slant delay. Two types of error that restrict the accuracy of the thin-shell model are absent in the conical domain model: (1) error due to the implicit assumption that the electron density is independent of the azimuthal angle at the IPP and (2) error arising from the slant-to-vertical conversion. At low latitudes or at mid-latitudes under disturbed conditions, the accuracy of SBAS systems based upon the thin-shell model suffers due to the presence of complex ionospheric structure, high delay values, and large electron density gradients. Interpolation on the vertical delay grid serves as an additional source of delay error. The conical-domain model permits direct computation of the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> slant delay estimate without the intervening use of a vertical delay grid. The key is to restrict each fit of GPS measurements to a spatial domain encompassing signals from only one satellite. The conical domain model is so named because each fit involves a group of GPS receivers that all receive signals from the same GPS satellite (see figure); the receiver and satellite positions define a cone, the satellite position being the vertex. A user within a given cone evaluates the delay to the satellite directly, using (1) the IPP coordinates of the line of sight to the satellite and (2) broadcast fit parameters associated with the cone. The conical-domain model partly resembles the thin-shell model in that both models reduce an inherently four-dimensional problem to two dimensions. However, unlike the thin-shell model, the conical domain model does not involve any potentially erroneous simplifying assumptions about the structure of the ionosphere. In the conical domain model, the initially four-dimensional problem becomes truly two-dimensional in the sense that once a satellite location has been specified, any signal path emanating from a satellite can be identified by only two coordinates; for example, the IPP coordinates. As a consequence, a <b>user</b> <b>s</b> slant-delay estimate converges to the correct value in the limit that the receivers converge to the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> location (or, equivalently, in the limit that the measurement IPPs converge to the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> IPP) ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze whether a {{politically}} connected firm that operates {{in a country with}} an established legal system and a low perceived level of corruption can benefit from its connections in the form of preferential access to land. More specifically, the thesis examines whether the political connections of Finland’s largest retail trade operator <b>S</b> <b>Group</b> have been related to Finnish municipalities’ zoning decisions concerning the group’s ABC service station stores during the period between 1996 and 2009. I also analyze whether the hypothesized favorable treatment of <b>S</b> <b>Group</b> in zoning decisions is related to the market share of its ABC service station stores. In this thesis, a political connection is defined as a dual role of a member of an <b>S</b> <b>Group</b> governance organ as a municipal politician. As <b>S</b> <b>Group</b> consists of 21 regional cooperatives that are independent companies with their own management, {{it can be argued that}} the group has a relatively strong local presence. Due to this geographically decentralized decision making structure, the group can be expected to be particularly well connected to municipal politics. DATA The main dataset used in this thesis consists of <b>S</b> <b>Group’s</b> political connections from the period between 1996 and 2009. The main sample includes 64 ABC service station stores that have been pure new investments, i. e. green-field projects, and that have been built between 1998 and 2010. The political connections dataset is built by cross-referencing the names of persons who have simultaneously been members of <b>S</b> <b>Group’s</b> governance organs and Finnish municipal politicians from 1996 to 2010. The political connections data used in this study is unique, as it is manually combined from the annual reports of <b>S</b> <b>Group’s</b> regional cooperatives, the Statistics Finland’s election database, and by directly requesting data from Finnish municipalities. Additionally, data on traffic amounts from the Finnish Transport Agency’s database and detailed establishment level data of small grocery stores and service stations from the Business Register of Statistics Finland are collected to assess the quality of the operating locations of service stations and their competitive situation. RESULTS The results show that the political connections of <b>S</b> <b>Group</b> are widespread during the entire examination period. However, the findings do not support the conclusion that the political connections of the group would have systemically affected the municipalities’ zoning decisions concerning ABC service station stores. The analysis shows that ABC service station stores are located in better operating areas than their competitors, but <b>S</b> <b>Group’s</b> political connections are not found to be associated with this dominance. Similarly, the findings do not support the conclusion that the political connections of <b>S</b> <b>Group</b> would have affected the market shares of its service station stores...|$|R
