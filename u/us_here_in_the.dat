2500|$|While President Obama {{expressed}} {{surprise at}} the decision, stating [...] "I think all of <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States were surprised, disappointed and angry about the release", the U.S. government was aware that a release was possible. The deputy head of the U.S. embassy in London, Frank LeBaron, {{wrote in a letter}} to the Scottish first minister Alex Salmond that the U.S. believed al-Megrahi should remain in prison for his role in downing Pan Am flight 103 in 1988, and continued: [...] "Nevertheless, if Scottish authorities come to the conclusion that Megrahi must be released from Scottish custody, the U.S. position is that conditional release on compassionate grounds would be a far preferable alternative to prisoner transfer, which we strongly oppose." [...] This same letter stressed the importance to the United States of America of a 3-months prognosis, despite it not being a legal requirement in Scotland: [...] "any such release should only come after the results of independent and comprehensive medical exams clearly establishing that Megrahi's life expectancy is less than three months".|$|E
2500|$|McKinney gained {{national}} attention for remarks she made following the 2001 US attacks, {{charging that the}} United States had advance knowledge of the attacks and that US President George W. Bush may have been aware and allowed them to happen, allegedly due to his father's business interests: [...] "It is known that President Bush's father, through The Carlyle Group, had–at {{the time of the}} attacks–joint business interests with the bin Laden construction company and many defense industry holdings, the stocks of which have soared since September 11." [...] In the month that followed the attacks, when New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani refused to cash a $10 million check written by Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in light of the Prince's suggestion that the attacks were an indication that the United States [...] "should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stand toward the Palestinian cause," [...] McKinney published an open letter to the Saudi Prince. She expressed her disappointment at Giuliani's action and stated, [...] "Let me say that there are {{a growing number of people}} in the United States who recognize, like you, that U.S. policy in the Middle East needs serious examination...Your Royal Highness, many of <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States have long been concerned about reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that reveal a pattern of excessive, and often indiscriminate, use of lethal force by Israeli security forces in situations where Palestinian demonstrators were unarmed and posed no threat of death or serious injury to the security forces or to others." ...|$|E

60|$|As for the Pongo themselves, {{their case}} was obvious. They were a dying tribe, the last {{descendants}} of some higher race, grown barren from intermarriage. Probably, too, {{they were at}} first only cannibals occasionally and from religious reasons. Then in some time of dearth they became very religious in that respect, and the habit overpowered them. Among cannibals, at any rate in Africa, as I knew, this dreadful food is much preferred to any other meat. I had not the slightest doubt that although the Kalubi himself had brought <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild hope that we might save him from a terrible death {{at the hands of}} the Beelzebub he served, Komba and the councillors, inspired thereto by the prophet called Motombo, designed that we should be murdered and eaten as an offering to the gods.

'Whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge. The Lord do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me."' Then she rose from her chair, and flinging herself on her knees at his feet, buried her face in his lap. [...] "Ella," [...] he said, [...] "the only injury you can do me is to speak of leaving me.

6000|$|My dear child, if the {{landlord}} {{of our house}} was {{in the habit of}} pulling the roof down upon our heads, and putting gunpowder under the foundations to blow us up, do you not think we should know what he meant, even though he never spoke a word? He would be very wrong in behaving so, of course: but one thing would be certain,--that he did not intend us to live in his house any longer if he could help it; and was giving us, in a very rough fashion, notice to quit. And {{so it seems to me}} that these poor Spanish Americans have received from the Landlord of all landlords, who can do no wrong, such a notice to quit as perhaps no people ever had before; which says to them in unmistakable words, [...] "You must leave this country: or perish." [...] And I believe that that message, like all Lady Why's messages, is at heart a merciful and loving one; that if these Spaniards would leave the western coast of Peru, and cross the Andes into the green forests of the eastern side of their own land, they might not only live free from earthquakes, but (if they would only be good and industrious) become a great, rich, and happy nation, instead of the idle, and useless, and I am afraid not over good, people which they have been. For in that eastern part of their own land God's gifts are waiting for them, in a paradise such as I can neither describe nor you conceive;--precious woods, fruits, drugs, and what not--boundless wealth, in one word--waiting for them to send it all down the waters of the mighty river Amazon, enriching <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Old World, and enriching themselves there in the New. If they would only go and use these gifts of God, instead of neglecting them as they have been doing for now three hundred years, they would be a blessing to the earth, instead of being--that which they have been.|$|E

We all see that, except our dear friend here, the milk of whose nature runs so softly that he would not have the heart to refuse the Pope the loan of his pulpit, if the Pope would come and ask it. We must not, however, allow the man to preach again here. It is not because his opinion on church matters may be {{different}} from ours--with that one would not quarrel. It is because he has purposely insulted us. When he went up into that pulpit last Sunday, his studied object was to give offence to men who had grown old in reverence of those things of which he dared to speak so slightingly. What! To come here a stranger, a young, unknown, and unfriended stranger, and tell us, {{in the name of the}} bishop his master, that we are ignorant of our duties, old-fashioned, and useless! I don't know whether most to admire his courage or his impudence! And one thing I will tell you: that sermon originated solely with the man himself. The bishop was no more a party to it than was the dean here. You all know how grieved I am to see a bishop in this diocese holding the latitudinarian ideas by which Dr. Proudie has made himself conspicuous. You all know how greatly I should distrust the opinion of such a man. But in this matter I hold him to be blameless. I believe Dr. Proudie has lived too long among gentlemen to be guilty, or to instigate another to be guilty, of so gross an outrage. No! That man uttered what was untrue when he hinted that he was speaking as the mouthpiece of the bishop. It suited his ambitious views at once to throw down the gauntlet to us--at once to defy <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quiet of our own religious duties--here within the walls of our own loved cathedral--here where we have for so many years exercised our ministry without schism and with good repute.
