5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve carries {{lower motor neurons}} that synapse with <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage {{will depend on the}} position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side. If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E
25|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} a hyperkinetic {{movement}} basal ganglia disease caused by lack of normal inhibitory inputs from medium spiny neurons of the basal ganglia. This poses the opposite effects of those associated with Parkinson's disease, including inappropriate activation of <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> As with the GABAergic mechanisms observed in relation to Parkinson's disease, a GABA agonist injected into the substantia nigra pars reticulata decreases inhibition of <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> resulting in ballistic involuntary motor movements, similar to symptoms of Huntington's disease.|$|E

25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} the second most common {{neurodegenerative}} disease after Alzheimer's disease. It is a hypokinetic movement basal ganglia disease caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the human brain. The inhibitory outflow of the basal ganglia is thus not decreased, and so <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> mediated by the thalamus, are not activated in a timely manner. Specific symptoms include rigidity, postural problems, slow movements, and tremors. Blocking GABA receptor input from medium spiny neurons to reticulata cells, causes inhibition of <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> similar to the inhibition that occurs in Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> (UMNs) send {{input to}} α-MNs via several pathways, {{including}} (but not limited to) the corticonuclear, corticospinal, and rubrospinal tracts. The corticonuclear and corticospinal tracts are commonly encountered {{in studies of}} upper and lower motor neuron connectivity in the control of voluntary movements.|$|E
25|$|The {{pyramidal}} tracts {{include both}} the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts. These are aggregations of efferent nerve fibers from the <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> that travel from the cerebral cortex and terminate {{either in the}} brainstem (corticobulbar) or spinal cord (corticospinal) and {{are involved in the}} control of motor functions of the body.|$|E

Pure <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> facial palsy may be another lacunar syndrome, due to a lesion in the internal capsule or corona radiata...|$|R
25|$|Like other neurons, {{lower motor}} neurons have both afferent (incoming) and efferent (outgoing) connections. Alpha motor neurons receive input {{from a number of}} sources, {{including}} <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> sensory neurons, and interneurons. The primary output of α-MNs is to extrafusal muscle fibers. This afferent and efferent connectivity is required to achieve coordinated muscle activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} the {{majority}} of the above hyperkinetic movements can be traced to improper modulation of the basal ganglia by the subthalamic nucleus. In many cases, the excitatory output of the subthalamic nucleus is reduced, leading to a reduced inhibitory outflow of the basal ganglia. Without the normal restraining influence of the basal ganglia, <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> of the circuit tend to become more readily activated by inappropriate signals, resulting in the characteristic abnormal movements.|$|E
25|$|Paralysis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of damage to α-MNs. Because α-MNs provide the only voluntary innervation to extrafusal muscle fibers, losing α-MNs effectively severs the connection between the brainstem and spinal cord and the muscles they innervate. Without this connection, voluntary and involuntary (reflex) muscle control is impossible. Voluntary muscle control is lost because α-MNs relay voluntary signals from <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> to muscle fibers. Loss of involuntary control results from interruption of reflex circuits such as the tonic stretch reflex. A consequence of reflex interruption is that muscle tone is reduced, resulting in flaccid paresis. Another consequence is the depression of deep tendon reflexes, causing hyporeflexia.|$|E

2500|$|The term {{pyramidal}} tracts {{refers to}} <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> that {{originate in the}} cerebral cortex and terminate in the spinal cord (corticospinal) or brainstem (corticobulbar). Nerves emerge in the cerebral cortex, pass down and may cross sides in the medulla oblongata, and travel {{as part of the}} spinal cord until they synapse with interneurons in the grey column of the spinal cord.|$|E
2500|$|The corticonuclear tract is {{so named}} because it connects the {{cerebral}} cortex to cranial nerve nuclei. (The corticonuclear tract is also called the corticobulbar tract, as the brainstem is sometimes called the [...] "bulb" [...] of the brain.) It is via this pathway that <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> from the cortex descend from the cortex and synapse on α-MNs of the brainstem. Similarly, UMNs of the cerebral cortex are in direct control of α-MNs of the spinal cord via the lateral and ventral corticospinal tracts.|$|E
2500|$|If fibres of the corticospinal tracts are damaged {{anywhere}} {{along their}} course from the cerebral cortex {{to the lower}} end of the spinal cord, this will give rise to an upper motor neuron syndrome. A few days after the injury to the <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> a pattern of motor signs and symptoms appears, including spasticity, hyperactive reflexes, a loss of the ability to perform fine movements, and an extensor plantar response known as the Babinski sign. Symptoms generally occur alongside other sensory problems. Causes of damage may include masses such as strokes, subdural hemorrhage, abscesses and tumours, [...] inflammation such as meningitis and multiple sclerosis, and trauma to the spinal cord, including from slipped discs.|$|E

50|$|Hypertonia {{is caused}} by <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> lesions which may result from injury, disease, or {{conditions}} that involve damage to the central nervous system. The lack of or decrease in <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> function leads to loss of inhibition with resultant hyperactivity of lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> Different patterns of muscle weakness or hyperactivity can occur based on {{the location of the}} lesion, causing a multitude of neurological symptoms, including spasticity, rigidity, or dystonia.|$|R
2500|$|The nerve axons {{traveling}} {{down the}} tract {{are referred to}} as efferent nerve fibers of the <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> These axons travel down the tracts in the white matter of the spinal cord until they reach the vertebral level of the muscle that they will innervate. At this point, the axons synapse with lower motor neurons. The majority of axons do not directly synapse with lower motor neurons, but instead synapse with an interneuron that then synapses with a lower motor neuron. This generally occurs in the anterior grey column. Nerve axons of the lateral corticospinal tract that did not cross over in the medulla oblongata do so {{at the level of the}} spinal cord they terminate in.|$|E
2500|$|Fibres {{from the}} [...] motor cortex travel with the corticospinal tract through the {{internal}} capsule, but terminate {{in a number}} of locations in the midbrain (cortico-mesencephalic tract), pons (Corticopontine tract), and medulla oblongata (cortico-bulbar tract). [...] The <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> of the corticobulbar tract synapse with interneurons or directly with the lower motor neurons located in the motor cranial nerve nuclei, namely oculomotor, trochlear, motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, abducens, facial nerve and accessory and in the nucleus ambiguus to the hypoglossal, vagus and accessory nerves. [...] These nuclei are supplied by nerves {{from both sides of the}} brain, with the exception of the parts of the facial nerve that control muscles of the lower face. These muscles are only innervated by nerves from the contralateral (opposite) side of the cortex.|$|E
2500|$|ALS {{itself can}} be {{classified}} a few different ways: by how fast the disease progresses (slow vs fast progressors), by whether it is inherited or sporadic, and by where it starts. [...] Most commonly (~70% of the time) the limbs are affected first. In this case, neurons in the brain (<b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons)</b> and in the spinal cord (lower motor neurons) are dying and this form is called [...] "limb onset". [...] In about 25% of cases, [...] muscles in the face, mouth, and throat are affected first because motor neurons {{in the part of}} the brain stem called the medulla oblongata (formerly called the [...] "bulb") start to die first along with lower motor neurons. This form is called [...] "bulbar onset". [...] In about 5% of cases muscles in the trunk of the body are affected first. [...] In all cases the disease spreads and affects other regions. [...] The symptoms may also be limited to one spinal region.|$|E
5000|$|Historical {{progression}} of spasticity and the <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> lesion {{on which it}} is based has progressed considerably in recent decades. However, the term [...] "spasticity" [...] is still often used interchangeably with [...] "upper <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> syndrome" [...] in the clinical settings, {{and it is not}} unusual to see patients labeled as [...] "spastic" [...] who actually demonstrate not just spasticity alone, but also an array of <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> findings.|$|R
50|$|Spasticity is {{a common}} feature of muscle {{performance}} after <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> lesions, but is generally of much less clinical significance than other features such as decreased strength, decreased control and decreased endurance. The confusion {{in the use of}} the terminology complicates assessment and treatment planning by health professionals, as many confuse the other findings of <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> syndrome and describe them as spasticity. This confusion potentially leaves health professionals attempting to inhibit an exaggerated stretch reflex to improve muscle performance, potentially leaving more significant UMNS changes such as weakness unaddressed. Improved understanding of the multiple features of the <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> syndrome supports more rigorous assessment, and improved treatment planning.|$|R
5000|$|Muscles {{affected}} by the <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> syndrome have many potential features of altered performance including: weakness, decreased motor control, clonus (a series of involuntary rapid muscle contractions), exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, spasticity and decreased endurance.The term [...] "spasticity" [...] is often erroneously used interchangeably with <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> syndrome, {{and it is not}} unusual to see patients labeled as spastic who demonstrate an array of UMN findings.|$|R
2500|$|The exact {{etiology}} of subluxation in post-stroke patients is unclear but {{appears to be}} caused by weakness of the musculature supporting the shoulder joint. [...] The shoulder {{is one of the most}} mobile joints in the body. [...] To provide a high level of mobility the shoulder sacrifices ligamentous stability and as a result relies on the surrounding musculature (i.e., rotator cuff muscles, latissimus dorsi, and deltoid) for much of its support. [...] This is in contrast to other less mobile joints such as the knee and hip, which have a significant amount of support from the joint capsule and surrounding ligaments. [...] If a stroke damages the <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> controlling muscles of the upper limb, weakness and paralysis, followed by spasticity occurs in a somewhat predictable pattern. [...] The muscles supporting the shoulder joint, particularly the supraspinatus and posterior deltoid become flaccid and can no longer offer adequate support leading to a downward and outward movement of arm at the shoulder joint causing tension on the relatively weak joint capsule. [...] Other factors have also been cited as contributing to subluxation such as pulling on the hemiplegic arm and improper positioning.|$|E
50|$|A {{subcortical}} loop exists {{within the}} brain linking <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> {{originating in the}} primary motor and pre-motor cortices and the brainstem, with the basal ganglia. These <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> eventually initiate movement by controlling the activity of lower motor neurons, located in the brainstem and spinal cord, and project out to innervate the muscles in the body. <b>Upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> also modulate activity of local circuit neurons, whose synapses are a large input to these lower motor neurons, in turn affecting subsequent movement. Thus, the basal ganglia indirectly influence movement via regulation of {{the activity of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> which ultimately determine activity of the lower motor neurons.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{route of}} nerve signals within the efferent somatic nervous system {{involves}} a sequence that {{begins in the}} upper cell bodies of motor neurons (<b>upper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons)</b> within the precentral gyrus (which approximates the primary motor cortex).
