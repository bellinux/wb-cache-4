5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each foot, with <b>unsheathed,</b> {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, {{making it easier}} for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on each foot. On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E
25|$|Hildr welcomed {{her father}} and offered him peace and a {{necklace}} on behalf of Heðinn. However, Hǫgni had already <b>unsheathed</b> his sword Dáinsleif, which gave wounds that never healed and like Tyrfing always killed a man once it had been <b>unsheathed.</b> A battle ensued and they fought all day and many died. In the evening Heðinn and Hǫgni returned to their camps, but Hildr stayed on the battle-field. She resurrected them with incantations and the fallen soldiers started to fight anew, and this went on until Ragnarök.|$|E

25|$|Adopted in 1924, the Kelantanese flag {{consists}} {{of only a}} red field with a white charge in the centre derived from its state coat of arms, consisting of the arm's crescent, five pointed star, dual spears and <b>unsheathed</b> krises. The red represents the honesty of Kelantan's settlers, citizens and king (the Sultan of Kelantan), while the charge signifies {{the sanctity of the}} Sultan of Kelantan.|$|E
25|$|Thin neurons and axons {{require less}} {{metabolic}} expense {{to produce and}} carry action potentials, but thicker axons convey impulses more rapidly. To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction, many neurons have insulating sheaths of myelin around their axons. The sheaths are formed by glial cells: oligodendrocytes in {{the central nervous system}} and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. The sheath enables action potentials to travel faster than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter, whilst using less energy. The myelin sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about 1mm long, punctuated by <b>unsheathed</b> nodes of Ranvier, which contain a high density of voltage-gated ion channels. Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that results from demyelination of axons in the central nervous system.|$|E

25|$|General Edmund Hogan {{was also}} a veteran of several heated {{political}} campaigns for seats in the council of the Territorial Legislature. Hogan represented Arkansas in the Territorial General Assembly of Missouri in 1816 and 1818, when Arkansas {{was part of the}} Missouri Territory. In the election of 1827, there were three candidates, Colonel Walker, General Hogan and Judge Scott. The election was apparently very heated. After the election was over, tensions appeared to calm and everything appeared quiet. On May 31, 1828 a public hanging occurred in Little Rock, which drew spectators from far and near. When the hanging was over Judge Scott {{made his way to the}} store of McLane & Badgett on the west side of Main street. He was discussing the circumstances of the hanging, when General Hogan entered the store. General Hogan was a man weighing nearly three hundred pounds, and stood over six feet tall. Judge Scott was a small man, not weighing more than one hundred and thirty pounds. The conversation went on, with both Scott and Hogan taking part, neither showing any animosity to the other. The conversation soon diverged from the hanging to politics, and before the men knew it they were discussing the old Walker and Hogan political race. This seemed to revive in the mind of General Hogan something that occurred in the triangular race between himself, Walker and Scott. He turned to Scott and accused him of writing a letter which was derogatory to Hogan. Scott at once informed the general that he had been misinformed. Hogan reiterated the statement and said that he believed that it was true. Scott denied it again, and apparently accused Hogan of lying. Both men were standing up and as soon as Scott made the last remark, Hogan struck him, knocking him to the floor. Scott remained on the floor for a moment, apparently knocked senseless. As Scott revived, he struggled to his feet, and Hogan prepared to strike another blow. As Scott arose he <b>unsheathed</b> a dirk from a sword cane which he carried and plunged the dirk several times into the body of General Hogan. Hogan fell and expired within an hour. Judge Scott was arrested by his brother, United States Marshal George Scott, and taken before an officer for trial. The facts as stated above were there proven, and the court held Hogan to have been the aggressor and released Judge Scott.|$|E
500|$|On the reverse, Lafayette holds a sword, {{extended}} upwards. Bartlett {{described the}} version of the statue that Barber worked from: [...] "Lafayette is represented in the statue as a fact and a symbol, offering his sword and services to the American colonists {{in the cause of}} liberty. He appears as the emblem of the aristocratic and enthusiastic sympathy shown by France to our forefathers." [...] Swiatek and Breen noted, [...] "We may take Lafayette's pose on the statue, as depicted on the coin, to represent him in triumphal procession rather than charging against the enemy—note his sheathed sword, like a Highland pipe major's baton, serving as a standard rather than brandished <b>unsheathed</b> as a weapon." ...|$|E
500|$|The jewelled Sword of Offering, made in 1820, has a gilded leather sheath, a {{blade of}} Damascus steel, and is encrusted with 3,476 {{precious}} stones. GeorgeIV paid almost £6,000 for the sword {{out of his own}} pocket. It remained in personal ownership until 1903 when it was deposited with the Crown Jewels. A monarch is either girded or presented with the sword as the Archbishop says: [...] "With this sword do justice, stop the growth of iniquity, protect the Holy Church of God, help and defend widows and orphans, restore the things that are gone to decay, maintain the things that are restored, punish and reform what is amiss, and confirm what is in good order". Afterwards, it is returned to the Keeper of the Jewel House by the abbey in exchange for a token sum of £5, and the sword is borne <b>unsheathed</b> {{for the rest of the}} ceremony.|$|E

500|$|The marquis had to {{take great}} risks to win these victories. In the Ytororó engagement, which {{occurred}} on 5 December, the allied objective was to take a bridge over the Ytororó River. Several {{attempts were made to}} cross the bridge, but each was repelled by intense fire from the Paraguayan positions. In the final attempt, the Brazilian soldiers panicked and began to flee in disorder. Caxias, witnessing the unfolding disaster, <b>unsheathed</b> his sword and charged on horseback toward the bridge, followed by his staff. He passed through the fleeing troops, shouting [...] "Hail to His Majesty", [...] "Hail to Brazil" [...] and finally, [...] "Sigam-me os que forem brasileiros!" [...] ("Those who are true Brazilians, follow me!") His display of courage stopped the retreat immediately; the units regrouped, and a vigorous attack led personally by Caxias overwhelmed the Paraguayan positions. Several men who were next to him during the attack were killed, as was his horse.|$|E
500|$|Description/Blazon: A silver color {{metal and}} enamel device 1 1/4 inches (3.18cm) in height overall {{consisting}} of a semi-circle divided into three sections each with concave base, the outer two sections silver and the center section of red, a vertical silver <b>unsheathed</b> sword point to base, the hilt resting on the red section of the semi-circle the lower edge of the guard coinciding with the concave base and the ends conjoined with the silver sections the blade between two lightning flashes points to base the points converging toward {{the point of the}} blade the flashes parallel to and enclosed by two narrow inclined silver lines starting at the diameter periphery of the semi-circle and meeting beneath the point of the sword, the area so enclosed of blue all above a stylized motto scroll, the ends simulating wings and terminating {{at the base of the}} semi-circle, bearing the inscription [...] "SKY SOLDIERS" [...] in blue letters; the areas between the narrow silver lines and motto scroll recessed and of silver.|$|E
500|$|Symbolism: The {{simulated}} parachute and stylized wings {{refer to}} the airborne mission of the Brigade. The <b>unsheathed</b> sword, point to base (implying from sky to ground) and the hilt against the red section of the parachute canopy, alludes to the combat assault jump made by the Brigade in February 1967, the first such jump made by any unit in Vietnam indicated by the [...] "V" [...] formed by the two lightning flashes on the V-shaped silver edged blue area. The single sword also alludes to other Brigade [...] "firsts" [...] such as first American ground unit in Vietnam, first in War Zones C and D and first in the Iron Triangle. The lightning flashes are also symbolic of the Brigade's striking power and surprise and rapidity of movement. The numerical designation of the Brigade can be readily simulated by various combinations of the design elements, i.e., the sword indicating one (1), {{the sum of the}} wings, the two lightning flashes and the three sections of the parachute canopy being Seven (7) and the latter by itself also being used for three (3).|$|E

500|$|Lépine {{then walked}} up an {{escalator}} {{to the third}} floor where he shot and wounded one female and two male students in the corridor. He entered another classroom and told the three students giving a presentation to [...] "get out," [...] shooting and wounding Maryse Leclair, who was standing on the low platform {{at the front of the}} classroom. He fired on students in the front row and then killed two women who were trying to escape the room, while other students dove under their desks. Lépine moved towards some of the female students, wounding three of them and killing another. He changed the magazine in his weapon and moved to the front of the class, shooting in all directions. At this point, the wounded Leclair asked for help; Lépine <b>unsheathed</b> his hunting knife and stabbed her three times, killing her. He took off his cap, wrapped his coat around his rifle, exclaimed, [...] "Ah shit," [...] and then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, twenty minutes after having begun his attack. About sixty unfired cartridges remained in the boxes he carried with him. He had killed fourteen women in total (twelve engineering students, one nursing student and one employee of the university) and injured fourteen other people, including four men.|$|E
500|$|Bowskill {{appreciated}} the 2D {{presentation of the}} investigations, saying that they suited the gameplay well and {{that it might have}} been difficult to find clues if 3D graphics had been used instead. Gouskos {{appreciated the}} game's presentation, calling it [...] "unique and outstanding"; she said that the music and sound effects work well with the drama, and that the cross-examination graphics, showing the two opposing lawyers along with the sound effect of a sword being <b>unsheathed,</b> gave an atmosphere similar to that of a fighting game. Harris, too, likened the style to that of a fighting game. Gouskos said that the graphics, while simple, work well to show each character's mood and personality. Harris said that the visuals were well-drawn and that the soundtrack was [...] "nicely rendered", but felt that the character animation was very limited. Cole said that the graphics, while dated, have [...] "visual flair". He appreciated the opening cinematics for the cases, which he thought were both stylish and ambiguous, and the character animations, which he called [...] "priceless". Nadia Oxford at USgamer said that early Ace Attorney games, despite the [...] "tinny" [...] sound of the Game Boy Advance versions, had spawned some of the most iconic music themes in video games; she noted [...] "The Detective That Came From the Wild West" [...] - the theme of Jake Marshall - as a particularly good track.|$|E
500|$|During {{a typical}} Polish {{coronation}} ceremony {{in the times}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the king-elect received Szczerbiec after his anointment and before being crowned and enthroned. The primate of Poland, that is the archbishop of Gniezno, picked up the <b>unsheathed</b> sword from the altar {{and handed it to}} the kneeling king. At the same time, he recited a formula which asked the monarch to use the sword to rule justly, defend the Church, fight evil, protect widows and orphans, and to [...] "rebuild what is damaged, maintain what is rebuilt, avenge what is unjust, reinforce what is well managed," [...] etc. Then, the king handed the sword to the Crown sword-bearer (miecznik koronny), who slid it into the scabbard and passed on to the primate. The primate, aided by the Crown and Lithuanian sword-bearers, fastened the scabbard to the king's belt. The king stood up and, facing onlookers, withdrew Szczerbiec, made three times {{the sign of the cross}} with it, and wiped it against his left arm before replacing it in the scabbard. The king's sword-wielding abilities were closely watched by his new subjects during this part of the ritual. When Augustus III betrayed his poor fencing skills at his coronation, nobles joked that they were going to have [...] "a peaceful lord". After Szczerbiec, a bishop handed the sovereign the Grunwald Swords symbolizing the monarch's reign over the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth.|$|E

He looks off to his right, which is to say away from the other two characters in the triptych. His face has a serious expression, and he holds a long <b>unsheathed</b> sword in front of him with both hands. The empty black [...] sheath is tucked into his blue patterned obi sash, and peeks out from behind his back along with a second matching sheathed sword. Both tsuka sword handles would peek out from his left side, the standard position for samurai as it made them more accessible for the right-handed.|$|E

[...] They also had the property of striking fear in the hearts of Orcs when used against them in combat. [...] All were well-crafted, and extraordinarily sharp. [...] Apparently, Gondolinian weapons were impervious to rust and corrosion, as the examples found in the trolls' lair were over six thousand years old and had been hanging in the lair for an indeterminate length of time, yet were sharp and ready for use when <b>unsheathed.</b>|$|E
