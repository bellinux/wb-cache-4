40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on understanding {{the first order}} theory of universal specializations of Zariski structures. Models of the theory are pairs, a Zariski structure and an elementary extension with a map (specialization) from the extension to the structure that preserves positive quantifier free formulas. The reader will find that this context generalizes both the study of algebraically closed valued fields (see [2]) and sheds light on the theory of Zariski structures. It is also a natural setting for studying compact complex manifolds with a standard part map. We determine the first order theory of universal specializations and prove that it is model complete. Also, we prove that the ground Zariski structure in its core language is stably embedded in models of the theory, which has nice consequences for the theory of Zariski structures. The structure of the paper is as follows. In the rest of Section 1 we will give the basic definitions of Zariski structures. In Section 2 we will define specializations and prove that {{anything that can be}} defined in a Zariski structure using a <b>universal</b> <b>specialization</b> which projects onto it, can be defined within the origina...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} feminist scholarship {{posed to}} family studies {{has been largely}} met through the incorporation of research on gender dynamics within families and intersectional differences among them. Despite growing attention to gender as performance and power in more diverse families, the more difficult work of understanding the dynamics of change among institutions including the family and using intersectional analyses to unpack relationships of power is only beginning. Reviewing the contributions researchers have made in these areas {{over the last decade}} and applying the idea of circuits to the study of care work, this article points to promising practices for both improving research on gender and families and contributing to the slow drip of institutional change. Two decades ago, I argued against a purely social psychological understanding of gender as a socialized role carried by individuals and primarily produced in and by families (Ferree, 1990). Instead, I suggested that thinking of gender in a more multilevel and dynamic way would also demand thinking of families differently. Drawing on feminist research, I challenged the functionalist assumptions that families were separate spheres of interaction with internally unitary interests, a natural and <b>universal</b> <b>specialization</b> of roles, and a foundational position in the social order.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{geometric}} principles underlying {{many of the}} known Trichotomy Theorems. The main aims are to unify the field construction in non-linear o-minimal structures and generalizations of Zariski Geometries {{as well as to}} pave the road for completely new results in this direction. In {{the first part of this}} thesis we introduce a new axiomatic framework in which all the relevant structures can be studied uniformly and show that these axioms are preserved under elementary extensions. A particular focus is placed on the study of a smoothness condition which generalizes the presmoothness condition for Zariski Geometries. We also modify Zilber's notion of <b>universal</b> <b>specializations</b> to obtain a suitable notion of infinitesimals. In addition, families of curves and the combinatorial geometry of one-dimensional structures are studied to prove a weak trichotomy theorem based on very weak one-basedness. It is then shown that under suitable additional conditions groups and group actions can be constructed in canonical ways. This construction is based on a notion of ``geometric calculus'' and can be seen in close analogy with ordinary differentiation. If all conditions are met, a definable distributive action of one one-dimensional type-definable group on another are obtained. The main result of this thesis is that both o-minimal structures and generalizations of Zariski Geometries fit into this geometric framework and that the latter always satisfy the conditions required in the group constructions. We also exhibit known methods that allow us to extract fields from this. In addition to unifying the treatment of o-minimal structures and Zariski Geometries, this also gives a direct proof of the Trichotomy Theorem for "type-definable" Zariski Geometries as used, for example, in Hrushovski's proof of the relative Mordell-Lang conjecture. This thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|R
40|$|Clearing Systems of Central and Eastern Europe, {{waiting for}} the TARGET 2 Securities I {{investigate}} the clearing systems in Europe, and try to assess the condition of clearing houses before the launch of TARGET 2 Securities. I examine the levels of development in the different regions, looking at how we can interpret the core-periphery relationship. I give {{an overview of the}} ancillary systems and I examine which of these could provide a basis for the operation of TARGET 2 Securities. I also reflect on the kinds of clearing practices prevalent today in areas outside the EU. I try to summarize the significance of the first connection wave, why and how the countries follow each other. How is it possible that Euroclear, the most famous clearing house only step is only planning to enter the system in a second wave, although it plays {{a central role in the}} European settlement processes? I assess whether the countries left out have to face a lag or real separation, or it is a simple ancillary way to join to the whole European system. Another very interesting question is whether joining the T 2 S is a real choice, or growing up to the European financial system is a necessary process. I make a detour in the direction of the characteristics of the Polish, Czech and Hungarian clearing systems, I show the settlement activity of Bulgaria and Albania. I will discuss desires, hopes and visions, the possible advantages of the new settlement platform, the factors and ideas that have promoted the process of joining T 2 S. I examine adaptive strategies that were created to offset the impact of the crisis. I shed light on whether globalization exerts pressure in the direction of clearing houses becoming <b>universal,</b> or <b>specialization</b> and fighting for a market gap will continue. Which fileds are unexploited? How can we find growth potential? Can the cheap labour force and Internet-based communication abolish the geographic differences? Is it all the same where we operate a clearing house? By any chance can we see an Americanization process in the clearing sector? (SWIFT-roots, English correspondence standards, common language for work, first of all English) To answer these questions, first of all I use the clearing house announcements and operating documents and I accomplish secondary statistical analysis using historical databases...|$|R
40|$|To take {{advantage}} of the globalization of markets, multinational corporations have increased the amount of innovation undertaken in their overseas subsidiaries. This has meant that managers in many different cultural environments now are innovating. This dissertation examines how the cultural values of 2769 managers in six organizations in 32 countries influence their preferences for different strategies of innovation champions. ^ The theoretical framework of this dissertation is fairly straightforward. All organizations, regardless of the society in which they are found, possess two <b>universal</b> characteristics [...] <b>specialization</b> of labor and a system of authority [...] which create resistance to innovation. Innovation champions are individuals who act to overcome these organizational obstacles. ^ However, while the organizational barriers to innovation are universal, the licenses accorded to champions to go about overcoming these obstacles are culture-specific. This study examines the relationship between the specific behaviors of innovation champions tolerated by members of a firm and three cultural values: individualism/collectivism, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance/uncertainty acceptance. The basic argument is that country level differences in these three cultural values influence country level differences in the strategies used by managers to overcome obstacles to innovation. ^ The study finds a number of significant relationships between cultural values and championing strategies. The most robust of these is that between individualism and rule breaking championing behavior. The more individualistic the society, the more managers prefer champions who violate organizational rules, norms and standard operating procedures to implement innovation. This finding is robust across numerous methodologies for analyzing the results of the study. ...|$|R
