5|$|After the Sangam age, most {{of present-day}} Tamil Nadu, {{including}} Madurai, came <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of the Kalabhra dynasty, which was ousted by the Pandyas around 590 CE. The Pandyas were outsted from Madurai by the Chola dynasty {{during the early}} 9th century.

The Madurai Sultanate then seceded from Delhi and functioned as an independent kingdom until its gradual annexation by the Vijayanagar Empire in 1378 CE. Madurai became independent from Vijayanagar in 1559 CE under the Nayaks. Nayak rule ended in 1736 CE and Madurai was repeatedly captured several times by Chanda Sahib (1740– 1754 CE), Arcot Nawab and Muhammed Yusuf Khan (1725– 1764 CE) in the middle of 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{as a small}} {{settlement}} in the seventh millennium BC, Tell Brak evolved during the fourth millennium BC {{into one of the}} biggest cities in Upper Mesopotamia, and interacted with the cultures of southern Mesopotamia. The city shrank in size {{at the beginning of the}} third millennium BC with the end of Uruk period, before expanding again around c. 2600 BC, when it became known as Nagar, and was the capital of a regional kingdom that controlled the Khabur river valley. Nagar was destroyed around c. 2300 BC, and came <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of the Akkadian Empire, followed by a period of independence as a Hurrian city-state, before contracting at the beginning of the second millennium BC. Nagar prospered again by the 19th century BC, and came <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of different regional powers. In c. 1500 BC, Tell Brak was a center of Mitanni before being destroyed by Assyria c. 1300 BC.

The Pandya dynasty in the region dates to several centuries before the Christian era from inscriptions by Ashoka (304–232 BCE) and mention in the Mahavamsa, the Brihat-Samhita and the writings of Megasthenes (350–290 CE).
