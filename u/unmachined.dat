50|$|Kits {{of parts}} offer a {{shortcut}} {{to the traditional}} method of building. Kits fall into two categories, machined and <b>unmachined</b> kits. <b>Unmachined</b> kits usually consist of drawings, castings, stock metal, and possibly fasteners and other fixings necessary to complete the model. They require machining facilities to complete and often also require additional components and raw materials. Typically the minimum machine requirements are a lathe, drilling machine, and possibly a milling machine. A good level of knowledge about machining is necessary to successfully complete these kits. Machined kits are a set of parts that are fully machined and only require finishing with hand tools, painting, and assembly. Workshop machinery is not required. The kit will typically contain all the parts necessary to complete the model. These kits require a lot less work than an <b>unmachined</b> kit, but are very expensive and choice of subject matter is limited.|$|E

50|$|The single-piece frame/receiver is molded from ABS {{plastic and}} largely <b>unmachined</b> with the {{exception}} of the bolt guides which the bottom of the bolt rides on. A stamped steel receiver cover rests over the top of the bolt, sandwiching it in place. The receiver cover hinges at the front of the frame and latches onto the rear of the bolt assembly. The bolt assembly consists of a cast steel bolt that rides on a spring and follower; a thin firing pin channel runs down the center of the bolt, allowing the stamped firing pin to be struck by the hammer and impact the cartridge at the front of the bolt.|$|E
40|$|Wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM) is well known process for generating intricate and complex profiles in hard metal matrix composites. But damaged surface layer with poor surface integrity is a major disadvantage of WEDM. Beside poor damaged surface layer, after rough/first cut in WEDM, some surface area remains <b>unmachined</b> on work surface during intricate machining such as in die cutting. This paper presents a study on <b>unmachined</b> surface area named as surface projection, in die cutting after rough cut in WEDM. Using scanning electron microscope images, length of <b>unmachined</b> surface projections have been determined. In order to minimize these surface projections from small cavities having complex geometries, trim cutting operation is the best alternative. Results show that using more than one trim cut with appropriate wire offset value, surface projections can be minimized, successfully...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFlank milling {{process is}} {{commonly}} {{applied in the}} aeronautical industry. It consists of manufacturing mechanical parts using {{the side of a}} machinning tool. This process is relevant to be less time consuming as it delivers better surface quality. However, flank milling can only be applied on ruled surfaces. In this article, we cover flank milling application on planar surfaces, a particular ruled surface type. In recent works we presented how to extract planar surfaces milling directions by using expertise provided through our industrial application. We take this study further, where we propose a validation for the proposed milling directions. This validation requires at first a translation of the problem from 3 D to 2 D. Then, by applying several proposed algorithms we extract for each direction its L-Zone. An L-Zone is the term we use to identify the <b>unmachined</b> part area using a particular milling direction. By intersecting the different L-Zones we obtain the G-Zone that consists of the total <b>unmachined</b> area. Computing the G-Zone for each planar surface indicates the ability of this surface to be flank milled. The proposed study is {{part of an effort to}} automate process planning of aeronautical parts. Automating this particular trade can result in a critical reduction of time, effort and costs in aeronautical industries, mainly due to having small production batch...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPerformance and {{durability}} of highly stressed components are greatly {{affected by the}} component's state including residual stresses. For processes with multi-edged tools, sequential cuts influence the surface layer. A method to forecast the component state is developed by using FE simulations of multiple chip formation done by broaching of SAE 5120 low alloy steel. Remeshing describes material separation, allowing a high detailed resolution of the machined surface layer including the workhardened layer and the residual stress state. Implemented simulation method extracts information from the machined work piece and defines initial conditions for a new <b>unmachined</b> work piece model. The work analyses the influence of tool temperatures on residual stress states after machining. Effects on the stresses appear below the surface. The results are compared to residual stress measurements...|$|E

40|$|A first {{end surface}} of a coiled {{compression}} spring at its relaxed length is machined to a plane transverse to the spring axis. The spring is then placed in a press structure having first and second opposed planar support surfaces, with the machined spring end surface bearing against the first support surface, the <b>unmachined</b> spring end surface bearing against a planar first {{surface of a}} lateral force compensation member, and an opposite, generally spherically curved surface of the compensation member bearing against the second press structure support surface. The spring is then compressed generally to its loaded length, and a circumferentially spaced series of marks, lying in a plane parallel to the second press structure support surface, are formed on the spring coil on which the second spring end surface lies. The spring is then removed from the press structure, and the second spring end surface is machined to the mark plane. When the spring is subsequently compressed to its loaded length the precisely parallel relationship between the machined spring end surfaces substantially eliminates undesirable lateral deflection of the spring...|$|E
40|$|The {{residual}} stress distributions in two 7449 aluminium alloy rectilinear blocks have been determined using neutron diffraction. Heat treatment included cold water immersion quenching and {{a period of}} precipitation hardening. Quenching induced very high magnitude {{residual stress}}es into the two blocks. One block was measured in this condition while the other was incrementally machined by milling to half thickness. Neutron diffraction measurements were made on the milled half thickness block at equivalent locations to the <b>unmachined</b> block. This permitted through thickness measurements from both blocks to be compared, revealing the redistribution of residual stresses induced by machining. A square cross section post in {{the centre of the}} machined face was left to act as a stress free reference sample. The distortions arising on the face opposite to that being milled were measured using a co-ordinate measuring machine. The residual stresses and distortion arising in the blocks have been compared to finite element analysis prediction and found to generally agree. Material removal only caused distortion and the residual stresses to redistribute; there was no stress relaxation evident. Acceptedpeer-reviewe...|$|E

A rich set of nonlinear behaviors of both the tool and workpiece including period-doubling bifurcation and chaos signifying the extent of machining instability at various depth-of-cuts is observed. Results presented herein agree favorably with physical experiments reported in the literature. It is found that, at and up to certain ranges of depth-of-cuts, whirling is non-negligible if the fundamental characteristics of machining dynamics are to be fully understood.

40|$|Centrifugal casting allows rapid biofabrication of tubular tissue {{constructs}} by suspending {{living cells}} in an in situ cross-linkable hydrogel. We hypothesize that introduction of laser-machined micropores into a decellularized natural scaffold will facilitate cell seeding by centrifugal casting and increase hydrogel retention, without compromising the biomechanical {{properties of the}} scaffold. Micropores with diameters of 50, 100, and 200 m were machined at different linear densities in decellularized small intestine submucosa (SIS) planar sheets and tubular SIS scaffolds using an argon laser. The ultimate stress and ultimate strain values for SIS sheets with laser-machined micropores with diameter 50 m and distance between holes as low as 714 m {{were not significantly different}} from <b>unmachined</b> control SIS specimens. Centrifugal casting of GFP-labeled cells suspended in an in situ cross-linkable hyaluronan-based hydrogel resulted in scaffold recellularization with a high density of viable cells inside the laser-machined micropores. Perfusion tests demonstrated the retention of the cells encapsulated within the HA hydrogel in the microholes. Thus, an SIS scaffold with appropriately sized microholes can be loaded with hydrogel encapsulated cells by centrifugal casting to give a mechanically robust construct that retains the cell-seeded hydrogel, permitting rapid biofabrication of tubular tissue construct in a “bioreactor-free” fashion...|$|E

This paper aims to {{elucidate}} {{the effect of}} ultrasonically assisted cutting (UAC) on microstructure in a machined surface and a chip of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy. To investigate microstructural evolution, a FE-based cutting model with an enhanced material formulation and temperature dependent material properties was developed. A Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) model for the Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy was employed to simulate dynamic recrystallization and predict a resultant grain size. Due to a specific thermomechanical load in UAC, the distributions of strains, strain rates and temperatures in a workpiece in the machining process were investigated. In this study, five points under the machined surface and ten points under the <b>unmachined</b> one were tracked to compare {{the evolution of a}} grain size and its average magnitude in the alloy subjected to conventional cutting (CC) and UAC. Besides of numerical modelling and experimental studies for the resultant grain size were compared and additional validation using microhardness measurements were conducted. The results showed that the average grain size of the machined surface and the chip in case of UAC was larger and more uniform than that in case of CC. The study also presents discussions about the effect of a vibration amplitude, a feed rate and a cutting speed on the average grain size in machining of Ti 6 Al 4 V. The comparison between CC and UAC indicates that the change in average grain size in UAC was smaller than that in CC, thus demonstrating a lower level of damage in UAC...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of bone tissue {{are reflected in}} its micro- and nanostructure {{as well as in}} its composition. Numerous studies have compared the elastic {{mechanical properties}} of cortical and trabecular bone tissue and concluded that cortical bone tissue is stiffer than trabecular bone tissue. This study compared the progression of microdamage leading to fracture and the related local strains during this process in trabecular and cortical bone tissue. <b>Unmachined</b> single bovine trabeculae and similarly-sized cortical bovine bone samples were mechanically tested in three-point bending and concomitantly imaged to assess local strains using a digital image correlation technique. The bone whitening effect was used to detect microdamage formation and propagation. This study found that cortical bone tissue exhibits significantly lower maximum strains (trabecular 36. 6 % ± 14 % vs. cortical 22. 9 % ± 7. 4 %) and less accumulated damage (trabecular 16100 ± 8800 pix/mm 2 vs. cortical 8000 ± 3400 pix/mm 2) at failure. However, no difference was detected for the maximum local strain at whitening onset (trabecular 5. 8 %± 2. 6 % vs. cortical 7. 2 %± 3. 1 %). The differences in elastic modulus and mineral distribution in the two tissues were investigated, using nanoindentation and micro-Raman imaging, to explain the different mechanical properties found. While cortical bone was found to be overall stiffer and more highly mineralized, no apparent differences were noted in the distribution of modulus values or mineral density along the specimen diameter. Therefore, differences in the mechanical behavior of trabecular and cortical bone tissue are likely to be in large part due to microstructural (i. e. orientation and distribution of cement lines) and collagen related compositional differences. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Tool chatter in {{longitudinal}} turning {{is addressed}} {{with a new}} perspective using a complex machining model describing the coupled tool-workpiece dynamics subject to nonlinear regenerative cutting forces, instantaneous depth-of-cut (DOC) and workpiece whirling due to material imbalance. The workpiece is modeled as a system of three rotors: <b>unmachined,</b> being machined and machined, connected by a flexible shaft. The model enables workpiece motions relative to the tool and tool motions relative to the machining surface to be three-dimensionally established as functions of spindle speed, instantaneous DOC, rate of material removal and whirling. Excluding workpiece vibrations from the cutting model is found improper. A rich set of nonlinear behaviors of both the tool and the workpiece including period-doubling bifurcation and chaos signifying the extent of machining instability at various DOCs is observed. Presented numerical results agree favorably with physical experiments reported in the literature. It is found that whirling is non-negligible if the fundamental characteristics of machining dynamics are to be fully understood. The 3 D model is explored along with its 1 D counterpart, which considers only tool motions and disregards workpiece vibrations. Numerical simulations reveal diverse behaviors for the 3 D coupled and 1 D uncoupled equations of motion for the tool. Most notably, observations made {{with regard to the}} inconsistency in describing stability limits raise the concern for using 1 D models to obtain stability charts. The nonlinear 3 D model is linearized to investigate the implications of applying linear models to the understanding of machining dynamics. Taylor series expansion about the operating point where optimal machining conditions are desired is applied to linearize the model equations of motion. Modifications are also made to the nonlinear tool stiffness term to minimize linearization errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate inadmissible results for the linear model and good agreement with available physical data in describing machining stability and chatter for the nonlinear model. Effects of tool geometry, feed rate, and spindle speed on cutting dynamics are also explored. It is observed that critical DOC increases with increasing spindle speed and small DOCs can induce cutting instability [...] two of the results that agree qualitatively well with published experimental data...|$|E
