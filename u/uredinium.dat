5000|$|Urediniospores: spores {{produced}} by a <b>uredinium</b> in some fungi such as rusts or smuts.|$|E
50|$|Urediniospores {{are formed}} in {{structures}} called uredinia, which {{are produced by}} fungal mycelia on the cereal host 1-2 weeks after infection. The urediniospores are dikaryotic (contain two un-fused, haploid nuclei in one cell) and are formed on individual stalks within the <b>uredinium.</b> They are spiny and brick-red. Urediniospores are the only type of spores in the rust fungus life cycle which are capable of infecting the host on which they are produced, and this is therefore {{referred to as the}} 'repeating stage' of the life cycle. It is the spread of urediniospores which allows infection to spread from one cereal plant to another. This phase can rapidly spread the infection over a wide area.|$|E
50|$|P. libanotidis {{usually only}} infects S. libanotis, {{though it has}} been {{observed}} on S. campestre as well. Its range is thus limited to that of the host plant, which is widespread across Eurasia. In 2003, appearance of the rust was reported {{for the first time in}} Iran. In Britain, S. libanotis is confined to two chalky regions in south-east England, and the rust in turn is quite rare. It had been observed twice, once in 1910 and again in 1946, and was then thought extinct, being unofficially Red Listed as extirpated from Britain in 2006. However, three years later, A. Martyn Ainsworth from Kew Gardens re-discovered the rust. The <b>uredinium</b> of P. libanotidis can in turn be parasitised by the fungus Eudarluca caricis.|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} the segregation of genes for {{resistance to the}} fungus Puccinia triticina in a cross between partially resistant wheat lines L- 574 - 1 and CI 13227 with two and four genes for resistance, respectively. The objectives {{of this study were}} to use parental, F 1, F 2, and backcross populations to quantify maternal effects, degree of dominance, and transgressive segregation, and to determine whether CI 13227 and L- 574 - 1 share any resistance genes for long latent period or small uredinia. In two experiments conducted in the greenhouse, the uppermost leaf of adult wheat plants was inoculated prior to heading with P. triticina. On days 6 to 21 after inoculation, the number of uredinia that erupted from the leaf surface was counted and used to calculate the mean latent period (MLP). The length and width of five arbitrarily selected uredinia were measured and used to calculate <b>uredinium</b> area. Midparent values, degree of dominance, and broad-sense heritability were calculated for MLP and <b>uredinium</b> area. For experiment A, MLP values for CI 13227, L- 574 - 1, F 1, and F 2 generations were 12. 2, 10. 5, 10. 2, and 10. 6 days, respectively. For experiment B, MLP values for CI 13227, L- 574 - 1, F 1, F 2, backcross to CI 13227, and backcross to L- 574 - 1 were 12. 3, 10. 0, 10. 6, 10. 8, 11. 1, and 10. 0 days, respectively. The inheritance of long latent period was partially recessive, and no maternal effect was present (P = 0. 62 to 0. 87 for the comparison of means in reciprocal crosses). Broad-sense heritability for MLP ranged from 0. 72 to 0. 74, and there was transgressive segregation in the F 2 and backcross populations. Uredinia of the F 1 generation were slightly larger than uredinia for CI 13227. The inheritance of <b>uredinium</b> size was partially dominant, and no maternal effect was present (P = 0. 5 to 0. 63). Broad-sense heritability for <b>uredinium</b> area ranged from 0. 36 to 0. 73 and transgressive segregation was present in the F 2 and backcross populations. The results for MLP indicate that lines CI 13227 and L- 574 likely share one gene for resistance (based on F 1 values) but not two genes (based on the presence of transgressive segregation). CI 13227 and L 574 - 1 appear to have at least one gene difference for <b>uredinium</b> area. The linear relationship between <b>uredinium</b> area regressed onto MLP was significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and r 2 values ranged from 0. 14 to 0. 26. These results indicate that the resistance in CI 13227 and L- 574 - 1 could be combined to create wheat cultivars with greater partial resistance than that possessed by either parent based on MLP or <b>uredinium</b> size...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTA {{model to}} {{estimate}} yield loss caused by Asian soybean rust (ASR) (Phakopsora pachyrhizi) {{was developed by}} collecting data from field experiments during the growing seasons 2009 / 10 and 2010 / 11, in Passo Fundo, RS. The disease intensity gradient, evaluated in the phenological stages R 5. 3, R 5. 4 and R 5. 5 based on leaflet incidence (LI) and number of <b>uredinium</b> and lesions/cm 2, was generated by applying azoxystrobin 60 g a. i/ha + cyproconazole 24 g a. i/ha + 0. 5 % of the adjuvant Nimbus. The first application occurred when LI = 25 % and the remaining ones at 10, 15, 20 and 25 -day intervals. Harvest occurred at physiological maturity and was followed by grain drying and cleaning. Regression analysis between the grain yield and the disease intensity assessment criteria generated 56 linear equations of the yield loss function. The greatest loss was observed in the earliest growth stage, and yield loss coefficients ranged from 3. 41 to 9. 02 kg/ha for each 1 % LI for leaflet incidence, from 13. 34 to 127. 4 kg/ha/ 1 lesion/cm 2 for lesion density and from 5. 53 to 110. 0 kg/ha/ 1 uredinium/cm 2 for <b>uredinium</b> density...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} on the capacity of pathogen populations to quantitatively adapt to their hosts and on the life traits that are involved is lacking at this time. In this article, we identified {{a situation in which}} a leaf rust pathotype (P 1) was found at a high frequency on a widely grown cultivar (Soissons) and we tested the hypothesis that P 1 was more aggressive on Soissons than other virulent pathotypes (P 2 and P 3). Several components of the pathogen life cycle were measured on adult wheat plants in two different experiments under greenhouse conditions: latent period, spore production per lesion and per unit of sporulating tissue, <b>uredinium</b> size, and lesion life span. Regardless of the component, pathotype P 1 was repeatedly found to be more aggressive than {{at least one of the}} other two pathotypes, with differences of 5 to 51 %. Breaking down spore production per lesion into <b>uredinium</b> size and spore production per square millimeter of sporulating tissue showed that the three pathotypes presented different aggressiveness profiles, suggesting different development constraints for the pathogen, either for its growth capacity into host tissues or its ability to exploit the host resources for spore production. Although leaf rust pathotypes present a clonal structure, quantitative differences were found for aggressiveness traits within a pathotype...|$|E
40|$|Cell wall bound {{peroxidase}} activity, cytochemically {{detected by}} 3, 3 '-diaminobenzidine (DAB), appears unevenly distributed in areolae of broad bean (cv. Aguadulce) leaves infected by the rust fungus Uromyces viciae-fabae (Pers.) Schroet. DAB positivity is not significantly traceable at {{the periphery of}} the areola and close to the site of <b>uredinium</b> formation; heavy DAB deposits occur on walls of haustoria containing mesophyll cells. Induction of localized peroxidase activity appears strictly related to the haustorium mother cell differentiation, i. e. to the incipient parasitic phase; it does not, however, counteract the intracellular growth of the haustorium...|$|E
40|$|Wild-type fungal {{population}} 851 -WT {{was selected}} for shortened latent period on cv. CI 13227 for five uredinial generations to study the adaptation of Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici to partially resistant wheat cultivars. Differences among wild-type and selected populations for traits contributing to parasitic fitness (i. e., latent period, infection frequency, and <b>uredinium</b> area and growth rate) were assessed in monocyclic infection experiments on susceptible cv. Monon and partially resistant cvs. Suwon 85, Sw 72469 - 6, L- 574 - 1, and CI 13227. Differences were greatest among fungal populations on cv. CI 13227. The mean latent period of selected population 851 -C 5 was 2 days shorter (~ 20 %) than that of wildtype population 851 -WT. In addition, uredinia of population 851 -C 5 expanded 40 % faster and produced ~ 75 % more urediniospores. On cv. L- 574 - 1, the selected population was also more fit than the wild-type progenitor for initial <b>uredinium</b> area and growth rate and cumulative urediniospore production. In contrast to wild-type and selected populations on cvs. CI 13227 and L- 574 - 1, selected population 851 -C 5 on cv. Monon produced slower expanding uredinia with fewer urediniospores than did population 851 -WT on Monon. These results show that variation in the latent period of P. recondita f. sp. tritici populations is partially under genetic control and wild-type P. recondita f. sp. tritici populations contain members reproductively more fit on partially resistant wheat cultivars but not necessarily on susceptible cultivars. Such members are capable of partially overcoming quantitative host resistance...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, {{has increased dramatically}} {{in recent years in}} durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) worldwide. Little is known on the occurrence and nature of resistance in this crop. Thirty durum wheat lines derived from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) were characterized for their resistance to the Mexican P. triticina race BBG/BN which was identified in 2001 and caused susceptibility {{of a large number of}} the world's durum wheat cultivars. Ten genotypes with race-specific resistance displayed low to intermediate seedling reactions to leaf rust. In the field, eight genotypes were immune and two displayed moderate levels of resistance. The slow rusting resistant lines displayed a range of disease severity responses indicating genetic diversity. The yield protection conferred by race-specific and slow rusting resistance was investigated in yield loss trials under high leaf rust pressure in the field. Race-specific resistance provided effective protection against yield losses caused by leaf rust. Yield losses for slow rusting resistant lines were higher than for immune race-specific resistant ones, but significantly lower than for the susceptible checks. Slow rusting lines with high resistance levels and reduced yield losses were identified. The slow rusting components; latent period, <b>uredinium</b> size and receptivity, were determined in greenhouse experiments, and associations of these components with leaf rust progress in the field were calculated. The results indicated that predominantly <b>uredinium</b> size contributed to slow leaf rust progress in durum wheat. The genetic basis and diversity of race-specific resistance was also determined in progenies from crosses of nine durum wheat lines with a leaf rust susceptible parent, and from intercrosses among the resistant parents. Five distinct sources of resistance were identified, four of which involved single partially, or completely, dominant genes, of which two were closely linked, and a pair of partially dominant complementary genes. Using molecular tools, the two linked genes were located on the long arm of chromosome 6 B. The best slow rusting resistant lines and the five distinct race-specific resistance sources can be used for enhancing the diversity and durability of leaf rust resistance in durum wheat...|$|E
40|$|Background: Lr 16 is {{a widely}} {{deployed}} leaf rust resistance gene in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that is highly effective against the North American Puccinia triticina population when pyramided with the gene Lr 34. Lr 16 is a seedling leaf rust resistance gene conditioning an incompatible interaction with a distinct necrotic ring surrounding the <b>uredinium.</b> Lr 16 was previously mapped to the telomeric region of the short arm of wheat chromosome 2 B. The goals {{of this study were}} to develop numerous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the Lr 16 region and identify diagnostic gene-specific SNP marker assays for marker-assisted selection (MAS). Results: Forty-three SNP markers were developed and mapped on chromosome 2 BS tightly linked with the resistance gene Lr 16 across four mapping populations representing a total of 1528 gametes. Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assays were designed for all identified SNPs. Resistance gene analogs (RGAs) linked with the Lr 16 locus were identified and RGA-based SNP markers were developed. The diagnostic potential of the SNPs co-segregating with Lr 16 was evaluated in a diverse set of 133 cultivars and breeding lines. Six SNP markers were consistent with the Lr 16 phenotype and are accurately predictive of Lr 16 for all wheat lines/cultivars in the panel. Conclusions: Lr 16 was mapped relative to SNP markers in four populations. Six SNP markers exhibited high quality clustering in the KASP assay and are suitable for MAS of Lr 16 in wheat breeding programs. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Durability of {{partially}} resistant wheat cultivars to wheat leaf rust {{depends on}} the amount of genetic variation in parasitic fitness within populations of the pathogen Puccinia triticina. To assess the durability of partial resistance, selection experiments were used to explore quantitative variation in parasitic fitness of P. triticina. Fungal populations 881 -WT and 882 -WT were selected for shortened latent period on partially resistant cvs. CI 13277 and Sw 72469 - 6 for multiple generations. Fitness components were measured for wild-type and selected fungal populations. Responses to selection and selection differentials were calculated, and broad-sense, realized heritabilities for latent period were estimated for wild-type fungal populations on CI 13227 and on Sw 72469 - 6. Selected populations had fitness characteristics, not limited to latent period, that could provide greater fitness in nature. Generally, more cycles of selection had greater effects on fitness. In particular cases, selected populations on a partially resistant cultivar had values for latent period, <b>uredinium</b> area, and sporulation no different from those of a susceptible host–pathogen combination. Heritabilities of latent period of populations 881 -WT and 882 -WT on CI 13227 or populations 881 -WT and 882 -WT on Sw 72469 - 6 ranged from 0. 65 to 0. 76 and 0. 17 to 0. 24, respectively. Our results suggest the variation to overcome quantitative host resistance exists in extant populations of P. triticina. In addition, because more of the variation in latent period for populations of P. triticina on CI 13227 was genetic than for populations on Sw 72469 - 6, CI 13227 is likely to be more vulnerable to pathogen adaptation despite its exceptionally long latent perio...|$|E
40|$|Some {{quantitative}} {{consequences of}} poplar rust attacks (Melampsora larici-populina and M. allii-populina) were analysed, both in absence and in presence of some preventive chemical treatments. Their effectiveness was previously assessed only partially and without evaluations of plant behaviour {{in the following}} vegetative season. Three IBS systemic triazoles (tebuconazole, cyproconazole and epoxyconazole), the translaminar cytotropic mandipropamid and a mixture of cyproconazole and azoxystrobin (methoxyacrilate similar to strobilurines) were tested on one-year plantlets of the susceptible clone ’ÂÂNeva’ (Populus ×canadensis). The products were sprayed twice in August 2010, the second treatment twenty days after the first one. The leaf area covered by uredinia was assessed in several dates {{from the beginning of}} August until the end of September, as well as the percentage of still living leaves on the plant (last ten days of October). In May 2011, the average leaf surface of side shoots close {{to the top of the}} crown and the Chlorophyll Content Index (CCI) were measured. The tested fungicides dramatically reduced the infections, except mandipropamid which showed no effectiveness. Tebuconazole and cyproconazole, either alone or in mixture with azoxystrobin, have offered the best performance (at the end of September, less than 10 % of leaf surface covered by uredinia vs. over 50 % of the control and mandipropamid treatment), followed by epoxyconazole that is anyway satisfying (about 15 % of surface covered by uredinia). The systemic properties of these fungicides allowed a preventive action on leaves sprouted after both of the treatments as well, thus <b>uredinium</b> eruption was limited to 20 % of leaf surface instead 40 % on the test thesis. The same effectiveness ranking was reiterated for the percentage of still living leaves on the plant at the end of October (about 45 % vs. 4 % of the control test) and, during the following season, for the average leaf surface of side shoots (over 800 cm 2 vs. less than 400 cm 2 of the test) and for the CCI parameter (over 21 vs. 16). Thus, the phylloptosis induced by rusts involves a seriously impaired leaf sprouting during the season following the attacks, both as regards tissue amount and its photosynthetic efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Rust (Melampsora spp.) is a {{damaging}} {{disease of}} willows (Salix spp.), including common osier (S. viminalis L.). So far, the pathogens {{of this species}} found in Europe were identified as M. larici-epitea Kleb. or M. ribesii-viminalis Kleb. Moreover, a stem infecting form (SIF), deprived of a sexual stage in its life cycle was reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to find out which species of the rust fungi cause disease symptoms on common osier in Poland. The isolates from common osier were compared to the ones originating from its putative hybrids with trembling aspen (Populus tremula L.) and Simon's poplar (P. simonii Carr.). Fungal isolates were obtained in 2008 - 2010 from 15 different genotypes of willows, including seven varieties of common osier (4 Swedish and 3 Polish), two landraces of common osier and six putative hybrids with poplars. Fungal isolates originated from three experiment sites, including west (Wielkopolska and Lubuskie) and north-east (Warmia) regions of Poland. To ensure the genetic uniformity, the isolates were derived from single uredinia, obtained from natural infection conditions. In all collected samples the position of uredinia was always hypophyllous. The diameter of uredinia was measured by Sigma Scan Pro software, after inoculation of four standard genotypes, including two common osier and two willow hybrids. The studies proved that the main cause of common osier rust is Melampsora larici-epitea f. typica. All studied isolates, including the ones obtained on putative hybrids, were very similar according to the size of uredinia and the size and morphology of urediniospores. The average size of a <b>uredinium</b> was 1. 1 mm diameter and slightly differed between the isolates (from 0. 9 to 1. 3 mm), depending on willow genotype, the quality of plant material used for artificial inoculations and infection conditions. The average size of a typical urediniospore was 12. 4 x 10. 5 µm, but the sizes varied from 9. 8 to 13. 2 µm. Urediniospores from common osier were slightly bigger and more oval (12. 5 x 10. 4 µm) as compared to spores from the putative hybrids Salix x Populus (12. 3 x 10. 6 µm), but the differences were statistically insignificant. The spores were ovoid, globoid or angular, evenly echinulated. The size of uredinia, as well as the size and morphology of urediniospores were in full agreement with literature data for M. larici-epitea f. typica...|$|E
