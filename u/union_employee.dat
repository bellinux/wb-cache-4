25|$|In contrast, in Germany, the {{relation}} between individual employees and employers {{is considered to be}} asymmetrical. In consequence, many working conditions are not negotiable due to a strong legal protection of individuals. However, the German flavor or works legislation has as its main objective to create a balance of power between employees organized in unions and employers organized in employers associations. This allows much wider legal boundaries for collective bargaining, compared to the narrow boundaries for individual negotiations. As a condition to obtain the legal status of a trade <b>union,</b> <b>employee</b> associations need to prove that their leverage is strong enough to serve as a counterforce in negotiations with employers. If such an employees association is competing against another union, its leverage may be questioned by unions and then evaluated in a court trial. In Germany, only very few professional associations obtained the right to negotiate salaries and working conditions for their members, notably the medical doctors association Marburger Bund and the pilots association Vereinigung Cockpit. The engineers association Verein Deutscher Ingenieure does not strive to act as a union, as it also represents the interests of engineering businesses.|$|E
500|$|After the Civil War ended, Yount became {{engaged to}} Estella Braun, a Western <b>Union</b> <b>employee</b> in Detroit, Michigan. [...] She {{was killed in}} a train wreck before their wedding could take place, and he never married. Yount {{traveled}} to Fort Kearny, along the Oregon Trail in Nebraska. [...] There he was hired as an Army bullwhacker, transporting supplies by wagon along the Bozeman Trail between Fort Laramie in modern-day Wyoming and Fort C. F. Smith in modern-day Montana. [...] There was conflict with Native Americans in this region in those years, and Yount fought against Cheyenne and Sioux warriors several times while on the trail. [...] In one incident, his ox wagon was harassed for four days by a party of Sioux warriors, until he fired his carbine at one warrior, hitting and probably killing the warrior's horse. [...] Supernaugh comments that Yount believed that Indians would kill him if they could, but that he did not [...] "blame the Indians for defending what was their country originally." [...] Yount also worked as a buffalo hunter during this period. [...] He sold buffalo tongues for $1 each to tourists in Cheyenne. [...] Yount believed that [...] "it was a pity to kill off the buffaloes, which were here in immense numbers, but {{it was the only way}} to get rid of the Indians, as the buffalo were their main source of subsistence." ...|$|E

However the nominal fee for lay members of ATU is only £1/year.

2500|$|Despite Carey's {{pledge to}} {{eliminate}} corruption {{and the influence}} of organized crime in the Teamsters, there were many who claimed that he did little in his first term to tackle the problem. Federal investigators accused Carey of engaging in [...] "halfhearted" [...] reforms, permitting a Teamster with known organized crime links to oversee a corrupt local, hindering court-appointed trustees reforming locals, and setting up an ethical practices committee which did nothing to stop corruption. One organized crime figure, Alphonse [...] "Little Al" [...] D'Arco, former acting boss of the Lucchese crime family, even said he had had a relationship with Carey in the 1960s and 1970s—statements Carey vigorously denied. U.S. Department of Justice officials began an investigation into the accusations in June 1994. There were also claims that Carey had improperly intervened in a jurisdictional dispute between two Teamster locals. Carey was also accused of a conflict of interest for not disclosing that he had received UPS stock from his deceased father's estate. [...] Joseph Carey bought eight shares of stock in 1935 for $320, which over the years (including stock splits) grew to 112,000 shares worth $1.9 million. The stock was sold back to the company by the estate in August 1992, and Carey was cleared of the charges. In May 1994, Carey was accused of corruption regarding a number of real estate deals. The Independent Review Board (IRB), a three-member panel created under a Federal court order in 1989 designed to help supervise the union's elections and rid it of corruption, began an investigation into how Carey was able to finance {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in real estate investments and into who may have forged Carey's estranged wife's signature on several documents. Carey later admitted he had forged his wife's signature but claimed he did so with her permission. Carey said he financed all the investments though savings, loans from relatives, and his $1.9 million inheritance. Carey was cleared by the IRB of all charges in July 1994. The IRB said no fraudulent activity had occurred in the financing of the deals. Although Carey did forge his wife's signature and asked a <b>union</b> <b>employee</b> to lie about it, the IRB concluded that Carey's wife had given him permission to sign her name and that the forgeries were unrelated to union activities.|$|E
