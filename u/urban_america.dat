25|$|In {{spite of}} {{limitations}} — and what artist {{is free of}} them? — Eakins' achievement was monumental. He was our first major painter to accept completely the realities of contemporary <b>urban</b> <b>America,</b> and from them to create powerful, profound art... In portraiture alone Eakins was the strongest American painter since Copley, with equal substance and power, and added penetration, depth, and subtlety.|$|E

25|$|Although these {{front-office}} gains continued, Major League Baseball saw {{a lengthy}} slow {{decline in the}} percentage of black players after the mid-1970s. By 2007, black players made up less than 9% of the major leagues. While this trend is largely attributed to an increased emphasis on the recruitment of players from Latin America (with the number of Hispanic players in the major leagues rising to 29% by 2007), other factors have been cited as well. Hall of Fame player Dave Winfield, for instance, has cited the fact that <b>urban</b> <b>America</b> places less emphasis and provides less resources for youth baseball than in the past. Despite this continued prevalence of Hispanic players, the percentage of black players rose again in 2008 to 10.2%.|$|E
25|$|Although {{financial}} setbacks and {{the decline}} of the territory system eventually forced DeCero to keep the promotion based in the general Chicago area, it was the only Midwestern regional promotion to survive into the 1990s. He was also able to feature former WWF stars such as Brian Knobs, Bob Backlund, Greg Valentine and King Kong Bundy as well as younger Extreme Championship Wrestling wrestlers Rob Van Dam and Sabu. His wrestling school also remained one of the top facilities in the region and whose students included Steve Boz, Terry Allen, Vic Capri, Trevor Blanchard, Jayson Reign, Mike Anthony, Ace Steel, Sosay, Kevin Quinn and Christopher Daniels. DeCero has also helped train referee Terry Hopper, female wrestler Sandra D and midget wrestler Puppet the Psycho Dwarf. In 1998, he had 70 students enrolled in his school. Several of his students have appeared as preliminary wrestlers at WWF house shows and televised events in the area. Around this time, he started a sister wrestling promotion, <b>Urban</b> <b>America</b> Pro Wrestling, which ran events in Chicago's inner city neighborhoods and featured African-American and minority wrestlers.|$|E

500|$|The {{writers of}} Enculturation, Steven Best and Douglas Kellner, {{have noted that}} Snoop Doggy Dogg and other rappers only condemn {{violence}} when it is directed against them, otherwise [...] "they celebrate it, internalize it, and embrace it as an ethos and means of self expression," [...] which some believe {{has an effect on}} the black-on-black crime. The release of music videos from Doggystyle and The Chronic has enabled the artists to add visual illustrations to their lyrics, which generally involve Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg driving around South Central, Los Angeles in a lowrider (a vehicle with lowered suspension). This imagery of the [...] "gangsta lifestyle" [...] is thought to have influenced young black males into trying to live the same lifestyle and it is also noted by T. Denean, writer of Pimps Up, Ho's Down: Hip Hop's Hold on Young Black Women, that the videos highlight the representation of class, race and Black masculinity within contemporary <b>urban</b> <b>America.</b>|$|E
500|$|Single young women, most {{commonly}} moved straight from field work in rural Sweden to jobs as live-in housemaids in <b>urban</b> <b>America.</b> [...] "Literature and tradition have preserved the often tragic {{image of the}} pioneer immigrant wife and mother", writes Barton, [...] "bearing her burden of hardship, deprivation and longing on the untamed frontier... More characteristic among the newer arrivals, however, was the young, unmarried woman... As domestic servants in America, they... were treated {{as members of the}} families they worked for and like 'ladies' by American men, who showed them a courtesy and consideration to which they were quite unaccustomed at home." [...] They found employment easily, as Scandinavian maids were in high demand, and learned the language and customs quickly. Working conditions were far better than in Sweden, in terms of wages, hours of work, benefits, and ability to change positions. [...] In contrast, newly arrived Swedish men were often employed in all-Swedish work gangs. The young women usually married Swedish men, and brought with them in marriage an enthusiasm for ladylike, American manners and middle-class refinements. Many admiring remarks are recorded from the late 19th century about the sophistication and elegance that simple Swedish farm girls would gain in a few years, and about their unmistakably American demeanor.|$|E

2500|$|Cisneros {{was well}} praised {{for his work}} as HUD Secretary. [...] Judith Evans {{reported}} in the Washington Post that both critics and supporters of Cisneros said he never lacked passion for his job {{and that he was}} able to make changes at the margin that made HUD a more effective housing provider. Rep. Rick Lazio (R-NY), chairman of the House subcommittee on housing and community opportunity in 1996 said Cisneros displayed [...] "the correct balance of advocacy on behalf of the president and a willingness to think creatively and outside the box in terms of solutions." [...] In his 1999 book, Inside Game/Outside Game: Winning Strategies for Saving <b>Urban</b> <b>America,</b> urban policy consultant David Rusk wrote “…in my view, (Cisneros was) the most successful of the ten secretaries of Housing and Urban Development since the cabinet agency was formed in 1965.” Clinton said Cisneros was a brilliant public servant, and additionally said that people had no idea how much he contributed to the government.|$|E
2500|$|The Democrats won easy {{landslide}} {{victories in}} 1932 and 1934, {{and an even}} bigger one in 1936; the hapless Republican Party seemed doomed. The Democrats capitalized on the magnetic appeal of Roosevelt to <b>urban</b> <b>America.</b> The key groups were low skilled ethnics, especially Catholic, Jewish, and black people. The Democrats promised and delivered in terms of political recognition, labor union membership, and relief jobs. The cities' political machines were stronger than ever, for they mobilized their precinct workers to help families who needed help the most navigate the bureaucracy and get on relief. FDR won the vote of practically every demographic in 1936, including [...] taxpayers, small business and the middle class. However, the Protestant middle class voters turned sharply against him after the recession of 1937-38 undermined repeated promises that recovery was at hand. Historically, local political machines were primarily interested in controlling their wards and citywide elections; the smaller the turnout on election day, the easier it was to control the system. However, for Roosevelt {{to win the presidency}} in 1936 and 1940, he needed to carry the electoral college and that meant he needed the largest possible majorities in the cities to overwhelm rural voters. The machines came through for him. [...] The 3.5 million voters on relief payrolls during the 1936 election cast 82% percent of their ballots for Roosevelt. The rapidly growing, energetic labor unions, chiefly based in the cities, turned out 80% for FDR, as did Irish, Italian and Jewish communities. In all, the nation's 106 cities over 100,000 population voted 70% for FDR in 1936, compared to his 59% elsewhere. Roosevelt worked very well with the big city machines, with the one exception of his old nemesis, Tammany Hall in Manhattan. There he supported the complicated coalition built around the nominal Republican Fiorello La Guardia, [...] and based on Jewish and Italian voters mobilized by labor unions.|$|E

If the threat was carried out, it would have destroyed the electronic machinary for sewage treatment, effectively ending indoor plumbing in the country's cities for months, if not years. The social upheaval would have been tremendous.|$|R
