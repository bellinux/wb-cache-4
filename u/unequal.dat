5|$|By {{overlaying}} {{a square}} grid of side length c onto the Pythagorean tiling, {{it may be}} used to generate a five-piece dissection of two <b>unequal</b> squares of sides a and b into a single square of side c, showing that the two smaller squares have the same area as the larger one. Similarly, overlaying two Pythagorean tilings {{may be used to}} generate a six-piece dissection of two <b>unequal</b> squares into a different two <b>unequal</b> squares.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus also {{responded to}} a problem first posed by Democritus. If a cone is divided by a plane {{parallel}} to its base, are the surfaces of the segments equal or <b>unequal?</b> If they are equal, then the cone becomes a cylinder; if they are <b>unequal,</b> then {{the surface of the}} cone must be stepped. The reply of Chrysippus was that the surfaces are both equal and <b>unequal.</b> Chrysippus was, in effect, negating the law of excluded middle with respect to the equal and <b>unequal,</b> and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern infinitesimal calculus, namely, the limit and the process of convergence towards a limit.|$|E

5|$|After China's {{defeat in}} the First Opium War, the country was {{forcibly}} opened to foreign trade {{by a number of}} treaties collectively referred to as the <b>Unequal</b> Treaties. Following the Treaty of Nanjing (1842), the British established the first treaty ports. Following China's concession to the British Empire, other foreign powers including France, the United States, Portugal, Germany, Japan, and Russia won concessions as well. Foreigners, who were centered in foreign sections of the cities, enjoyed legal extraterritoriality as stipulated in the <b>Unequal</b> Treaties. Foreign clubs, racecourses, and churches were established in major treaty ports. Some of these port areas were directly leased by foreign powers, such as the concessions in China, effectively removing them from the control of local governments.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they did}} not fix their {{schedules}} to the clock in the modern sense, ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour was longer during summer. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, hora tertia, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. After ancient times, equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted <b>unequal,</b> so civil time no longer varies by season. <b>Unequal</b> hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of Mount Athos and all Jewish ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|Although much of Hornung's {{work has}} fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories {{continued}} to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories dealt with {{a wider range of}} themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, class and the <b>unequal</b> role played by women in society. Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E
5|$|Around 120,000 {{men were}} mobilised during the conflict, and of these about 3,500 were killed.

Due to the persistence of Saigō Takamori, a prominent leader of the imperial faction, the Tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency, and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under the new government.|$|E

Many borrowed words in Berber also have native synonyms, e.g. /lbab/ or /tiflut/ 'door', the latter used more in rural areas. The contact was <b>unequal,</b> as Moroccan Arabic has not borrowed as much from Berber languages, though Berber has contributed to Moroccan and Algerian Arabics' very reduced vowel systems.|$|E
5|$|Curves {{that have}} self-crossings may reach {{singularities}} before contracting to a point. For instance, if a lemniscate (any smooth immersed curve {{with a single}} crossing, resembling a figure 8 or infinity symbol) has <b>unequal</b> areas in its two lobes, then eventually the smaller lobe will collapse to a point. However, if the two lobes have equal areas, then they will remain equal throughout {{the evolution of the}} curve, and the isoperimetric ratio will diverge as the curve collapses to a singularity.|$|E
