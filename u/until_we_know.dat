According to the sheet music {{published}} by Musicnotes.com, [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is a CCM and alternative CCM set in common time in the key of F major with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Mark Hall's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of F5. The song has regarded as a re-invention of [...] "Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee" [...] and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, the song alters {{the format of the}} former, rearranging the song's overall structure while adding a chorus. [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is led by a [...] "driving" [...] and [...] "pulsing" [...] string section that has been compared to Coldplay's [...] "Viva la Vida". Mark Hall felt that the band's arrangement brought out the message of one of the song's final verses ("God our Father/Christ our brother/all who live in love are thine/teach us how to love each other/and fill us to the joy divine"); Hall described the message by saying [...] "God's our father and Christ's our brother, we have this connection with God. But if we can't love each other, the joy isn't completed. Its not real joy yet <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> how to love the people that are around us".|$|E
2500|$|Queen Elizabeth II, {{political}} leaders and religious leaders variously expressed concern and distress over the incident, and called for calm. Prime Minister David Cameron made the following statement:This country will be absolutely resolute in its stand against extremism and terror. This action was a betrayal of Islam and the Muslim communities that give so much to our country. We will defeat violent extremism by standing together. We will not rest <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> every detail. [...] they {{wanted to start a}} war in London and she replied, [...] "You are going to lose, it is you against many." [...] She speaks for all of us.|$|E
2500|$|In her June 2013 {{address to}} the Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference, Palin {{declared}} her opposition to American involvement in the ongoing Syrian civil war: [...] "Militarily, where is our Commander-in-Chief? We’re talking now more new interventions. I say, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> what we’re doing, {{until we have a}} Commander-in-Chief who knows what he’s doing, well, Chief, in these radical Islamic countries who aren’t even respecting basic human rights, where both sides are slaughtering each other as they scream over an arbitrary red line, ‘Allah Akbar,’ I say, until we have someone who knows what they’re doing, I say, let Allah sort it out!" [...] "Allah Akbar" [...] is usually translated [...] "God is Great" [...] and used in various contexts by Muslims; [...] "Allah" [...] is the Arabic word for God.|$|E

"We {{could not}} help it," [...] laughed the prince, in reply; [...] "for the road wound right and left <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> not which way we traveled; and then it finally circled around again to your castle. But to-morrow we shall seek a new path and bid you {{farewell}} forever." ...|$|R

2500|$|Aside {{from the}} Fox News story on July 25, {{mainstream}} news sources {{did not immediately}} report the story. Articles describing the Enquirer allegations were eventually published by the magazines, New York and Radar. The claims were also mentioned in opinion columns and in-house blogs of several other papers. On July 23, Glenn Beck talked about the story on his program, Headline News, recommending that Edwards sue the Enquirer if its story was proven false. On that same day, Roxanne Roberts, a style writer for The Washington Post, said, [...] "We have no evidence this is true. Lots of juicy details—enough so Edwards may feel he has to address the issue, especially if it's not true and there's an innocent explanation. Or not. That won't stop anyone from talking about it, but let's assume, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> the facts, {{that this could be}} false." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So I did, you see," [...] Harry said; [...] "but I did {{not dare}} to go in <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> whether you had been taken too. If you had not come after a time we should have looked for another lodging, though I knew well enough {{that you would not}} tell them where you lived." ...|$|R

Then while we hoisted the reefed {{mainsail}} she struck. A comber threw her up the sand; we lowered all sail and let her drive, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> by the smoother water she had crossed the shoal. Then two anchors brought her up." ...|$|R

There weren't enough seatbelts to go around so every time Mum saw a white car in the distance, Lydia, as the smallest, had to slide off the seat and onto our feet.

5000|$|The idea of phonetic space {{could not}} have {{developed}} <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> what phonetics was and had a way to place sound in space. While Grassmann's development of linear algebra set us on the conceptual path to placing values in space, it was C. G. Kratzenstein who first published details methods to synthesize speech in the 1700s. [...] "Although when his principal phonetic work, was published in 1781 and 1782 there was no clear understanding of acoustic resonance, his accomplishment - via trial and error - was remarkable and contributed to accumulating [...] "existence proofs" [...] that speech could be understood in physical and physiological terms." ...|$|R
60|$|Our trace {{rose and}} fell over height and valley, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>we</b> were come to a wonderland at last. We stood one evening on a spur as the setting sun flooded the natural park below us with a crystal light and, {{striking}} a tall sycamore, turned its green to gold. We were now on the hills whence the water ran down to nourish the fat land, and I could scarce believe that the garden spot on which our eyes feasted could be {{the scene of the}} blood and suffering of which we had heard. Here at last was the fairyland of my childhood, the country beyond the Blue Wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. You mustn't imagine I've {{tackled the}} problem this very morning; I've been {{considering}} {{it for some}} time, and I've talked and consulted with Alora and Irene and Laura and the other girls about {{the best way to}} redeem the situation. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> the situation was desperate long before last night's meeting. So all our plans are made, and we believe we can sell all the bonds required. It was our policy to keep silent <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> what the big mass-meeting last night would accomplish, but we suspected it would turn out just the way it did--a fizzle. So the job's up to us, and if you'll sit quiet, Gran'pa Jim, and let us girls do the work, we'll put Dorfield in the honor column by Saturday night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jasper is right," [...] said Mabel, {{who could}} speak, though {{her voice sounded}} huskily and smothered; [...] "I have no fears, uncle, and will stay here <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> what has become of our friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us go back again, Matteo. It is no use our {{thinking}} of anything <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> what {{has really been}} done, and you are sure {{to be able to}} learn, at home, what steps have been taken." ...|$|E

"I {{was proud}} to hear it at the time, Squire; {{and when it was}} in the papers that our George had got the Victoria Cross, and all our {{neighbours}} came in to congratulate us, we felt prouder still. Up to the time when we got your letter, <b>we</b> did not <b>know</b> for sure where he was. He had said he meant to enlist, and from the humour that he was in when he went away we guessed it to be in some regiment where he could get to the wars. We felt the more glad, as you may guess, from the fact that both the Missus and I had wronged him in our thoughts. We learnt that before we got the news, and it was not <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>we</b> had been wrong that either of us opened our lips about it, though each of us knew what the other thought." ...|$|R

5000|$|Although Deke Slayton (who was {{responsible}} for all flight assignments as Director of Flight Crew Operations) opined that Schweickart [...] "would have been a logical lunar module pilot" [...] on subsequent lunar missions—indeed, the standard rotation of the era would have placed him on the backup crew for Apollo 12 and the prime crew of Apollo 15 —"that bout of space sickness had everybody worried... it didn't seem {{like a good idea}} to put him back in... at this point." [...] Following his mission, Schweickart [...] "basically called the shot that I really didn't want to be assigned to a flight <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> more about motion sickness" [...] and became [...] "a motion sickness guinea pig" [...] for six months; while [...] "he didn't learn that much" [...] during the testing, it is now accepted that as many as half of space travelers suffer from space adaptation syndrome to some extent.|$|R
60|$|At {{this second}} stage of humiliation, (I mean the {{insulting}} declaration in consequence of the message to both Houses of Parliament,) {{it might not have}} been amiss to pause, and not to squander away the fund of our submissions, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> what final purposes of public interest they might answer. The policy of subjecting ourselves to further insults is not to me quite apparent. It was resolved, however, to hazard a third trial. Citizen Barthélemy had been established, {{on the part of the}} new republic, at Basle,--where, with his proconsulate of Switzerland and the adjacent parts of Germany, he was appointed as a sort of factor to deal in the degradation of the crowned heads of Europe. At Basle it was thought proper, in order to keep others, I suppose, in countenance, that Great Britain should appear at this market, and bid with the rest for the mercy of the People-King.|$|R

50|$|The {{reliable}} {{scientific evidence}} in the case presents one, and one only, unknown male donor. Given that, I could not in good conscience allow this case to go to trial before the identity of this male donor is determined, and the full truth is known.

50|$|There are {{winds of}} change in the Kaddisfly camp, and as with the nation, it's time we move forward. First off, we should {{apologize}} for not keeping you all updated properly over the last 5 months, but quite honestly there wasn't much to talk about <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> exactly what <b>we</b> wanted to say. Some of {{you may or may not}} know that Kile Brewer has left Kaddisfly. His departure came late in the summer and was not all that unexpected. Kile moved to Denver with his wife and wanted to start a new chapter in his life. We are still very close with Kile and we wish him the best in all his future endeavors.As Kaddisfly we may very well end up finishing horses galloping one day, but for now I suppose the popular thing to say would be we are on a small hiatus. There will always be our back catalog, and our internet presence will remain the same because Kaddisfly isn't dead, just hibernating. We also still have some unreleased material that may surface at some point.|$|R
60|$|What {{prohibitions}} {{should we}} be under, we two Uitlanders in this Utopian world?

If {{it was not the}} property of individuals it might be the property of the State. But beyond that we might have our doubts.
