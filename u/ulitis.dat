40|$|Morphological {{changes of}} spermatocystographical picture s were studied in 93 {{patients}} with primary seminal vesicular diseases and 79 patients with various {{diseases of the}} neighboring organs. The following results were obtained. 1. In cases of nonspecific spermatocystiti s, irregularity of the shade and lack of distinction between the shadow defect and the shade were demonstrated. In chronic infections, abnormal dilatation was recognized. 2. Extravasation from the sem i nal vesicle was frequently demonstrated in hemospermia as well as rarely in nonspecific inflammation and tuberculosis of the seminal vesicle. 3. In cases of tuberculosis of the seminal vesicle, although the irregularity of the shade was recognizable, the border-line between shadow defect and shade was rather clearly demonstrated. In addition asymmetrical picture was occasionally seen as the results of cavity formation or cure with scar formation. 4. In cases of stone of the seminal vesicle, radiolucent stone was observed in some instances, which suggested us a necessity of the technique for differential diagnosis with stone formation in the neighboring organs. Abnormal dilatation of the vesicle was also seen at the proximal portion of the site of stone like stone of the uninary tracts. 5. Many patients with abnormal dilatation of the seninal vesicle had complaints of sterility or hemospermia and a diagnosis was not infrequently established by spermatocystography. 6. The differentiation between prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma was based upon {{the interpretation of the}} grade of dilatation and elongation as well as fragmentation or disappearance of the ejaculatory duct. The extent of infiltration and size of tumor were able to be estimated by the grade of deformation of the seminal vesicle itself and elongation of the ejaculatory duct. 7. The presence of prostatic stone c o uld be recognized based upon the relation to the shadow. The changes of the ejaculatory duct and distal part of the seminal duct were able to give us a supposition on the grade of secondary infections. 8. In cases of cancer of the urinary bladder and rectu m, deformation or disappearance of inside were demonstrated when the cancerous infiltration extended in the sorrounding tissue of the seminal vesicle. 9. In cases of coll i c <b>ulitis,</b> the ejaculatory ducts were found to run inordinate way bilaterally and specific shadow of club-like form was demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Focusing on {{reducing}} the air consumption {{of an air}} flotation rail system, a flowrate-amplified flotation element was recently developed. This new flotation element <b>ulitises</b> the rotational flow to intake extra air via an intake hole, and thus, effectively improves the flotation height. Compared to a conventional flotation element, the flowrate-amplified flotation element can reduce air consumption by approximately 50 % for the same load and flotation height. To {{gain an understanding of}} the flow phenomenon in the flowrate-amplified flotation element, experiments and CFD simulations are conducted in this study. Based on the results, we found that the flowrate-amplified flotation element could take a part of the kinetic energy of the rotating air to suck in extra air. The intake hole greatly affects the pressure field and velocity field of the flotation element. Additionally, the effects of the variant gap height and supplied flow rate were also discussed. The results indicate that the pressure distribution decreases as the gap height increases and increases as the supplied flow rate increases...|$|R
