40|$|Abstract: Revenue Assurance {{describes}} a methodology to increase a company’s income by determining where revenue gets lost, and {{to maximize their}} profits by eliminating revenue leakage and lowering operating costs. Especially in times of increasing data volume {{and more and more}} complex business and operational systems infrastructure, it is a challenge to find methods for detecting revenue leakage and its reasons. In this paper we will focus on the data quality aspect of revenue assurance and introduce a method to detect revenue-related data quality problems and their root causes. For high parallelism and efficiency a grid-based database is used to load all relevant data according to a defined metamodel, calculate adequate quality criteria and generate cleansing reports. This method is supported with a case study in the area of telecommunication returning a significant result of <b>underbilling.</b> Sample of the used quality criteria and scenarios of the cleansing procedure are given in detail...|$|E
40|$|Context: Although {{cervical}} cancer {{is an unusual}} cause of death among women 65 and older, most elderly women in the US report continuing to undergo periodic Pap smear screening. Objective: To describe the incidence of Pap smears and downstream testing among elderly women. Setting: Claims-based analysis of female Medicare enrollees age 65 and older. Methods: Using three years of Medicare Part B 5 % Files (1995 – 1997), we differentiated between women undergoing screening Pap smears and those undergoing Pap smears for surveillance of previous abnormalities or Pap smear follow-up. We determined the proportion of elderly women under-going Pap smear testing and rates of downstream testing and procedures after an initial Pap smear. Results: Four million female Medicare beneciaries over 65 years underwent Pap smear testing between 1995 and 1997, representing 25 % of the eligible population. After adjusting for <b>underbilling</b> for Pap smears under Medicare, 43 % of women over 65 are estimated to have undergone Pap smear testing during the 3 -year period. The large majority (90 %) of Pap smears were for screening, while 10 % were done for surveillance or follow-up. For every 1000 women with a screening Pap smear, 39 {{had at least one}} downstream intervention within eight months of the initial Pap smear, including seven women who underwent colposcopy and two women who had other surgical procedures.

The voters alleged that Rose was <b>underbilled</b> for {{services}} provided by Data and Field Services, a political company created by the Working Families Party. DFS provides services such as phone banking, polling and get-out-the-vote efforts. Rose should have paid DFS $100,000, but the lawsuit alleged that her campaign was <b>underbilled</b> because she was endorsed by the Working Families Party, a violation of election laws. [...] Rose's campaign settled by paying DFS $8,525, and did not have to acknowledge any wrongdoing on the behalf of her campaign or DFS.|$|R

40|$|Prior to {{the fall}} of 2000, there were no {{accepted}} records of Dusky Flycatcher for Nebraska. With {{the exception of a}} single sight record by Silcock (17 May 1992) judged 2 ̆ 2 Hypothetical 2 ̆ 2 by the Nebraska Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union Records Committee, this species had been unreported in Nebraska. Dusky Flycatchers breed locally in the Black Hills of South Dakota (Peterson 1990) and were presumed to occur in western Nebraska. Here, we report the capture of three Dusky Flycatchers in Kimball County and three additional sight records from western Nebraska. On 31 August 2000, we were mist netting below the dam of Oliver Reservoir in Kimball County. At 10 : 05 a. m., we captured an Empidonax that we suspected was a Dusky Flycatcher. We returned to the car to measure and photograph the bird before releasing it at 10 : 45 a. m. The bird was clearly an Empidonax flycatcher {{on the basis of the}} small size, wing bars, eyering, and bill shape. The bill was rather long with a moderately broad base and a strong triangular shape (the sides of the bill were not convex). The <b>underbill</b> was bright orange at the base with the proximal one half being dark-colored. The color distinction on the <b>underbill</b> was not sharp, but was instead rather gradual. There were prominent whiskers (at least 1 cm in length) at the base of the bill. The head was dark gray, a bit darker on the crown. The bird had a prominent white eye ring that broadened slightly behind the eye (a 2 ̆ 2 teardrop 2 ̆ 2 shape). The throat was paler and contrasted with the darker olive-gray upper breast. The mantle was olive and distinctly contrasted with the grayer head. The wings were dark with two clear white/buff wingbars. The rectrices were dark olive. The legs were black. The bird did not vocalize. After photographing the bird, we took a series of measurements suggested by Pyle (1997) to confirm our identification (see Table 1). The primary projection was short, and we also noted that p 4 and pl 0 were roughly the same length. On the basis of moderate feather wear, ossified skull, <b>underbill</b> coloration, and plumage, we concluded the bird was an adult Dusky Flycatcher. Furthermore, on the basis of the relatively short (for a Dusky Flycatcher) measures for wing and tail lengths, we concluded the bird was probably a female, but this conclusion is by no means solid...|$|R

40|$|FROM {{time to time}} {{attention}} is directed in the literature {{to the possibility of}} injurious effects resulting from the habitual use in the diet of certain types of baking powders. This is particularly true of those powders which contain tartrates or aluminum compounds as the leavening agents. Investigations in many laboratories have shown that tartrates, when administered parenterally to animals, produce a severe form of nephritis associated with profound destruction of the tubular epithelium. Several years ago studies in this laboratory (Rose, 1924) demonstrated that the subcutaneous administration to rabbits of sodium tartrate leads to enormous increases in non-protein nitrogen, urea, creat-inine, sugar and cholesterol of the blood, accompanied by diminished excretion of total nitrogen in the urine. In many of the animals the ability to excrete phenolsuÃ¯fonephthalein dropped to zero. Pearce and Ringer (1913) report that the characteristic renal lesions occur regardless of the mode of administration of the tartrate, provided the latter reaches the circulation. On the other hand, it has been clearly shown that when tar trates are given by mouth, much larger doses are required than when they are introduced parenterally (cf. <b>Underbill,</b> Wells and Goldschmidt, 1913; Pearce and Ringer, 1913; Salant and Smith, 1914). In human subjects, Post (1914) was unable to obtain evidence of albuminuria or cast formation after giving medicinal doses of Rochelle salts to normal individuals, nor could he demonstrate an aggravation of an existing nephritis following oral tartrate administration. Thus {{there appears to be no}} doubt as to the nephrotoxicity of tartrates injected subcutaneously; but the evidence regarding the influence of these materials when administered orally is not so clear. Furthermore, it does not follow necessarily, because a single large dose by mouth does or does not lead to renal injury, that comparable effects would result from the alimentary introduction of small amounts over long periods of time. * Some of the earlier experiments reported herein were conducted by A. L. Rawlins...|$|R
