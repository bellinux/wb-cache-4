2500|$|In 1980, {{the author}} of Confessions of a <b>Union</b> <b>Buster,</b> Martin J. Levitt, {{reported}} that he conducted a counter-organizing drive at a nursing home in Sebring, Ohio. He assigned confederates to scratch up cars, then blamed it on the union. [...] Similar activities have not been reported by others, yet Levitt said that creating and exploiting a prolonged climate of fear was key for him destroying the union's credibility.|$|E
2500|$|In {{bottom-up}} organizing, {{management and}} labor are pitted {{against each other}} and management often schedules retaliatory, aggressive tactics {{in an effort to}} break the chapter, called [...] "union-busting." [...] The intention of such union-busting may be to [...] "nip it in the bud" [...] before getting locked into a costly collective bargaining agreement. Management may feel that the organizing campaign encourages and capitalizes upon worker disobedience and perceived disloyalty. For this reason, management may hire anti-union consultants or lawyers known as [...] "union-busters" [...] or [...] "union avoidance consultants." [...] With the goal of thwarting organizing, union-busters typically have a two-pronged approach: firstly, management will cut deals with individual workers to betray the union and secondly, to exploit loopholes in labor law in an effort to derail or sandbag the election process. The emergence of union-busting as an industry is a relatively new phenomenon and is described in Martin Levitt's book Confessions of A <b>Union</b> <b>Buster.</b> Prior to the emergence of the union-avoidance industry, practitioners were mainly [...] "goon squads" [...] also used for strike-breaking. In the U.S., the largest and most well-known [...] "goon squad" [...] for hire was the Pinkerton Detective Agency, still active today, though in a different capacity. William W. Delaney's [...] "My Father Was Killed By Pinkerton Men" [...] is a song about the violence that often surrounded early American labor strife.|$|E
2500|$|Beeson's {{confirmation}} was {{a difficult}} one. Beeson did not help his position by speaking frankly about his actions as a corporate director of industrial relations. [...] He testified on January 20 about using the NLRB's employer free speech provisions to defeat a union organizing drive in Pennsylvania, and admitted {{that he could be}} fairly described as a <b>union</b> <b>buster.</b> He bluntly accused the Herzog board of twisting the meaning of the Taft-Hartley Act, and said it was his intention to roll back the Board's [...] "pro-labor" [...] bias. He also said that Farmer had been the one to recommend his name to Eisenhower for appointment to the Board. Democratic Senator Herbert H. Lehman pointed to a newspaper report in which Beeson claimed he intended to return to his labor relations job after leaving the NLRB. Beeson said the paper had misquoted him. Democratic Senators Paul Douglas, John F. Kennedy, and Lehman all expressed concern that Beeson was a [...] "company man" [...] and could not administer the law in a neutral way, and won a two-day postponement of his confirmation hearing on January 20. After the postponement expired, all Democrats on the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare boycotted the nomination hearings, depriving the committee of a quorum and preventing it from conducting business. But the boycott didn't last, and after two days the Democrats returned to the committee. On hearings held on January 25, Congress of Industrial Organizations secretary-treasurer James B. Carey (in oral testimony) and United Mine Workers of America president John L. Lewis (in written testimony) both excoriated Beeson as not impartial. The committee then voted 7–6 along party lines to recommend Beeson and send the nomination to the Senate floor.|$|E
25|$|The {{comic book}} The Goon issue #37 {{tells the story}} of a similar fire at a girdle factory that takes the lives of 142 women who worked there. After the fire, the {{surviving}} women attempt to unionize and the Goon comes to their aid after <b>union</b> <b>busters</b> try to force them back to work. Author Eric Powell specifically cites the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire as an inspiration for the story.|$|R
2500|$|Trade unions often {{refer to}} {{management}} consulting firms, industrial relations consultants labor law specialist, Industrial psychology specialists, and independent contractors such as unemployed industrial relations personnel and former union organizers who represent management in non union environments or during ballot elections as <b>union</b> <b>busters</b> when they work to either prevent employees from forming a union or work to liquidate an existing union. [...] It {{is not considered}} union busting when these firms simply advise management on contract negotiations.|$|R
2500|$|The CFS {{has also}} been criticised for lacking transparency: [...] "a solid {{understanding}} of its place within our campus and vice versa is next to non-existent {{for the majority of}} students." [...] The organisation has been also been accused of too often taking part in partisan political activity, without consulting students. The CFS has accused anti-CFS students of being right-wing <b>union</b> <b>busters,</b> with Fred Hahn stating that: [...] "Workers know that the push for decertification votes, whether for labour or students’ unions, are not driven by an interest in democracy, but by a commitment to weaken the collective voice of union members." ...|$|R

50|$|Modest Stein (1871-1958), born Modest Aronstam, was a Russian-born American {{illustrator}} {{and close}} associate of the anarchists Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman. He was Berkman's cousin and intended replacement in the attempted assassination of Henry Clay Frick, an industrialist and <b>union</b> <b>buster,</b> in 1892. Later Stein abandoned active anarchism {{and became a}} successful newspaper, pulp magazine, and book illustrator, while continuing to support Berkman and Goldman financially.|$|E
50|$|Martin J. Levitt's {{interpretation}} is as follows:The law regulates labor unions' internal affairs and union officials' relationships with employers. But {{the law also}} required companies to report certain expenditures related to their anti-union activities. Fortunately for <b>union</b> <b>busters,</b> loopholes in the requirements allow management and their agents to ignore the provisions aimed at reforming their behavior. The loopholes require consultants to file if they communicate with employees either {{for the purpose of}} persuading them not to join a union, or to gain knowledge about the employees or the union that may be passed on to the employer. However, most consultants accomplish these goals by indirect means, using supervisors and management as their first line of contact with employees. Even before the Act was passed, labor consultants had identified front-line supervisors as the most effective lobbyists for management.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, {{violence}} against unions in the United States has included attacks by detective and guard agencies, {{such as the}} Pinkertons, Baldwin Felts, Burns, or Thiel detective agencies; citizens groups, such as the Citizens' Alliance; company guards; police; national guard; or even the military. In the book From Blackjacks To Briefcases, Robert Michael Smith states that during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries, anti-union agencies [...] "spawned violence and wreaked havoc" [...] on the labor movement. According to Morris Friedman, detective agencies were themselves for-profit companies, and a [...] "bitter struggle" [...] between capital and labor could be counted upon to create [...] "satisfaction and immense profit" [...] for agencies such as the Pinkerton company. Harry Wellington Laidler wrote a book in 1913 detailing how one of the largest <b>union</b> <b>busters</b> in the United States, Corporations Auxiliary Company, had a sales pitch offering the use of provocation and violence.|$|R
50|$|Lucky Jim Camp was {{the home}} of miners {{sympathetic}} to the Confederate cause during the American Civil War. A mile up the canyon, above Huse Spring, was a camp with <b>Union</b> sympathies called <b>Buster</b> Falls.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, {{the author}} of Confessions of a <b>Union</b> <b>Buster,</b> Martin J. Levitt, {{reported}} that he conducted a counter-organizing drive at a nursing home in Sebring, Ohio. He assigned confederates to scratch up cars, then blamed it on the union. Similar activities have not been reported by others, yet Levitt said that creating and exploiting a prolonged climate of fear was key for him destroying the union's credibility.|$|E
50|$|However, in 1993 {{the same}} year Confessions of a <b>Union</b> <b>Buster</b> was released, and 6 years after Martin J Levitt called the AFL-CIO professed his change, his cycle of {{deceptive}} psycho pathology had not. The Superior Court of the State of California County of Contra Costa filed against Martin Jay Levitt for violation of Penal Code Section 529 False Personation and Penal Code 532 (a) for obtaining credit by false pretenses for taking over $25,000.|$|E
5000|$|Martin J. Levitt (14 October 1944 [...] - [...] 21 November 2004) was a {{supervisory}} trainer, <b>union</b> <b>buster</b> and a union organizer on and {{off over}} a 20-year period before 1987 when he reportedly changed direction. He went from anti union to anti managemant and founded Justice for Labor Foundation and later wrote about his career in his autobiography released in 1993 entitled Confessions of a <b>Union</b> <b>Buster</b> which he authored with Terry Conrow Toczynski. The book found success among labor unions due to the lurid details he outlined about [...] union busting tactics {{he claims to have}} used. Levitt says he entered the field in 1969 [...] "as a young man with no particular feelings about unions but with a desire to use his considerable wits and smooth tongue to get ahead." [...] Levitt claims to have been [...] "one of the multimillion-dollar industry's best talents...caught up in the money and intellectual pleasure of the pursuit." [...] During his so-called reformed career he was known for holding seminars, newspaper articles and some national television interviews such as 60 minutes and the TODAY show.|$|E
5000|$|One area of {{criticism}} {{has been the}} CFS's refusal to let member federations defederate - with the CFS often returning petitions to student unions without acknowledging them. One student commented that [...] "CFS are like a creepy ex-boyfriend who won’t let it go." [...] In fact, British Columbian Premier Christy Clark had campaigned against the CFS {{when she was a}} student in the 1980s. The CFS is also criticised for being ineffective, with one student stating that [...] "They don’t put enough emphasis on focused lobbying of elected officials, and continue to prefer the protests and sit-ins." [...] This is important because students pay about $14 a year in membership fees to the CFS. The CFS has also been criticised for lacking transparency: [...] "a solid understanding of its place within our campus and vice versa is next to non-existent for the majority of students." [...] The organisation has been also been accused of too often taking part in partisan political activity, without consulting students. The CFS has accused anti-CFS students of being right-wing <b>union</b> <b>busters,</b> with Fred Hahn stating that: [...] "Workers know that the push for decertification votes, whether for labour or students’ unions, are not driven by an interest in democracy, but by a commitment to weaken the collective voice of union members." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the time}} of the American Civil War, three new mining camps {{developed}} in the middle canyon. In 1862, Lucky Jim Camp was formed along Eldorado Canyon above January Wash, south of the Techatticup Mine. [...] Lucky Jim Camp was the home of miners sympathetic to the Confederate cause. A mile up the canyon was a camp with <b>Union</b> sympathies called <b>Buster</b> Falls.|$|R
5000|$|That fall news of {{the strikes}} brought a flood of miners to the canyon. Several camps were founded in the canyon. San Juan, or Upper Camp were {{at the top of}} the canyon, near modern Nelson, Nevada. Midway down the canyon near the Techatticup Mine were Alturas and Louisville. At the mouth of the canyon was the landing Colorado City. Later during the American Civil War, in 1862, Lucky Jim Camp was formed along Eldorado Canyon above January Wash, south of the Techatticup Mine. [...] Lucky Jim Camp was the home of miners {{sympathetic}} to the Confederate cause. A mile up the canyon was a camp with <b>Union</b> sympathies called <b>Buster</b> Falls.|$|R
5000|$|Martin J. Levitt {{wrote an}} [...] "autobiography" [...] about his journey for {{forgiveness}} at every union hall for his {{past as a}} <b>union</b> <b>buster.</b> He tried in his book to ascribe all his dirty deeds to everyone who represented management. Many union members ignored Levitt's serial amoral proclivities and hoisted him as the high priest of virtue. A safe statement would be that a labor attorneys and consultants are no more like Martin Levitt than a union organizer is like Jimmy Hoffa or Jackie Presser.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to fixed route service, Atlantic Express also served approximately 104 {{school districts in}} five states with yellow school bus service, primarily in the Northeast. Atlantic Express at its peak had operations in twelve states, but had significantly downsized and had exited the mid-western and southwestern United States, and Florida well before its closure. Its bankruptcy was cemented by former Mayor Bloomberg, as he {{is well known for}} being a <b>Union</b> <b>buster.</b> ATU 1181 was much too weak of a union (and still is) to dispute contracts with Bloomberg and said company.|$|E
50|$|The 1970s and 1980s were an {{altogether}} more hostile {{political and economic}} climate for organized labor. Meanwhile, {{a new breed of}} <b>union</b> <b>buster,</b> with degrees in industrial psychology, management, and labor law, proved skilled at sidestepping requirements of both the National Labor Relations Act and Landrum-Griffin. In the 1970s the number of consultants, and the scope and sophistication of their activities, increased substantially. As the numbers of consultants increased, the numbers of unions suffering NLRB setbacks also increased. Labor's percentage of election wins slipped from 57 percent to 46 percent. The number of union decertification elections tripled, with a 73 percent loss rate for unions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{last chapter}} of Levitt's book contradicts that [...] "need" [...] didn't drive {{him to leave}} union busting. In 1987, the year of his awakening, Levitt was unemployed, back in rehab, had been indicted for felony {{insurance}} fraud and car theft, had lost his house to debt, {{and in need of}} a relative to pay off the $150,000 balance of his mortgage, and most importantly, in need of a way to earn a living. Contrary to his reported feelings of [...] "horror and remorse", his [...] "need" [...] did not lead him to redemption but to yet another union busting job even AFTER he famously called the AFL-CIO to repent his [...] "dirty deeds". In 1988 he busted the Teamsters at Structural Composite Industries (SCI) in Pomona CA and claims to have earned $40,000. After busting the Teamsters, he went to San Diego to address the Brotherhood of Carpenters as a reformed <b>union</b> <b>buster.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Walmart {{has been}} criticized for its {{policies}} against labor unions. Critics blame workers' reluctance to join the labor union on Walmart anti-union tactics such as managerial surveillance and pre-emptive closures of stores or departments who choose to unionize. Walmart states that it is not anti-union but [...] "pro-associate," [...] arguing that its employees do not need to pay third parties to discuss problems with management as the company's open-door policy enables employees to lodge complaints and submit suggestions {{all the way up the}} corporate ladder. In 1970, Walmart's late founder Sam Walton resisted a unionization push by the Retail Clerks International Union in two small Missouri towns by hiring a professional <b>union</b> <b>buster</b> to conduct an anti-union campaign. On the union buster's advice, Walton also took steps to show his workers how the company had their best interests in mind, encouraging them to air concerns with managers and implementing a profit-sharing program. A few years later, Walmart hired a consulting firm, Alpha Associates, to develop a union avoidance program.|$|E
