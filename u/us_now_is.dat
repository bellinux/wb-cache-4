[...] Obama quoted the lyrics of the Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields song [...] "Pick Yourself Up" [...] from the musical comedy Swing Time, saying that [...] "starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America." [...] In an article for The New York Times, columnist and former drama critic Frank Rich noted the link to the lyric in Field's song from the movie, writing that Obama offered in his address [...] "one subtle whiff of the Great Depression".|$|E
500|$|In mid-September, Nixon's {{running mate}} Spiro Agnew {{went on the}} {{offensive}} against Humphrey; {{he referred to the}} Vice President as being [...] "soft on Communism," [...] along with softness on inflation, and [...] "law and order," [...] comparing him to former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. At this time, Nixon sent his adviser, former Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania, on a fact finding trip to Europe to gather intelligence on Western alliance and Soviet issues. In response to Humphrey's calls for a face to face debate, Nixon remarked: [...] "Before we can have a debate between Nixon and Humphrey, Humphrey's got to settle his debate with himself." [...] Nixon campaigned in San Francisco, in front of 10,000 supporters amidst an array of protests. The candidate took on the protesters first hand, and delivered his [...] "forgotten American" [...] speech, declaring that election day would be [...] "a day of protest for the forgotten American," [...] a group which included those that [...] "obey the law, pay their taxes, go to church, send their children to school, love their country and demand new leadership." [...] By month's end, many in the Nixon campaign believed his election was guaranteed, beginning to prepare for the transition period, despite Nixon's warning that [...] "the one thing that can beat <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> overconfidence." [...] Gallup showed Nixon leading Humphrey 43% to 28% at the end of September.|$|E
500|$|Northumberland {{was tried}} on 18 August 1553 in Westminster Hall. The panels {{of the jury}} and judges were largely made up of his former colleagues. Dudley hinted that he had acted on the {{authority}} of Prince and Council and by warrant of the Great Seal. Answered that the Great Seal of a usurper was worth nothing, he asked [...] "whether any such persons as were equally culpable of that crime ... might be his judges". After sentence was passed, he begged the Queen's mercy for his five sons, the eldest of whom was condemned with him, the rest waiting for their trials. He also asked to [...] "confess to a learned divine" [...] and was visited by Bishop Stephen Gardiner, who had passed most of Edward's reign in the Tower and was now Mary's Lord Chancellor. The Duke's execution was planned for 21 August at eight in the morning; however, it was suddenly cancelled. Northumberland was instead escorted to St Peter ad Vincula, where he took the Catholic communion and professed that [...] "the plagues that is upon the realm and upon <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> that we have erred from the faith these sixteen years." [...] A great propaganda coup for the new government, Dudley's words were officially distributed—especially in the territories of the Emperor Charles V. In the evening the Duke learnt [...] "that I must prepare myself against tomorrow to receive my deadly stroke", as {{he wrote in a}} desperate plea to the Earl of Arundel: [...] "O my good lord remember how sweet life is, and how bitter ye contrary." [...] On the scaffold, before 10,000 people, Dudley confessed his guilt but maintained: ...|$|E

Her ready wit and {{speaking}} lip, not her beauty, had brought him to her side; {{and now he was}} forced to acknowledge that her power over him had been supreme. Sooner than leave her he would risk all. She did feel her triumph; but there was nothing in her face to tell him that she did so. As to what she would now do she did not for a moment doubt. He had been precipitated into the declaration he had made not by his love, but by his embarrassment. She had thrown in his teeth the injury which he had done her, and he had then been moved by his generosity to repair that injury by the noblest sacrifice which he could make. But Lucy Robarts was not the girl to accept a sacrifice. He had stepped forward as though he were going to clasp her round the waist, but she receded, and got beyond the reach of his hand.

60|$|A vast {{majority}} of people are being swamped by the spectacular side of the business. It was very largely my fear of being so swamped myself that made me reluctant to go as a spectator to the front. I knew that my chances of being hit by a bullet were infinitesimal, but I was extremely afraid of being hit by some too vivid impression. I was afraid that I might see some horribly wounded man or some decayed dead body that would so scar my memory and stamp such horror into me as to reduce me to a mere useless, gibbering, stop-the-war-at-any-price pacifist. Years ago my mind was once darkened very badly for some weeks with a kind of fear and distrust of life through a sudden unexpected encounter one tranquil evening with a drowned body. But in this journey in Italy and France, although I have had glimpses of much death and seen many wounded men, I have had no really horrible impressions at all. That side of the business has, I think, been overwritten. The thing that haunts me most is the impression of a prevalent relapse into extreme untidiness, of a universal discomfort, of fields, and of ruined houses treated disregardfully.... But that is not what concerns us now in this discussion. What concerns <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> the fact that this war is producing spectacular effects so tremendous and incidents so strange, so remarkable, so vivid, that the mind forgets both causes and consequences and simply sits down to stare.|$|E
60|$|After such {{a fantastic}} story as this of Simeon, {{it is full}} time (some readers may have {{thought that it was}} full time long since) to give my own opinion of the miracles, visions, daemons, and other portents which occur in the lives of these saints. I have refrained from doing so as yet, because I wished to begin by saying {{everything}} on behalf of these old hermits which could honestly be said, and to prejudice my readers' minds in their favour rather than against them; because I am certain that if we look on them merely with scorn and ridicule,--if we do not acknowledge and honour all in them which was noble, virtuous, and honest,--we shall never be able to combat their errors, either in our own hearts or in those of our children: and that we may have need to do so is but too probable. In this age, as in every other age of materialism and practical atheism, a revulsion in favour of superstition is at hand; I may say is taking place round us now. Doctrines are tolerated as possibly true,-- persons are regarded with respect and admiration, who would have been looked on, even fifty years ago, if not with horror, yet with contempt, as beneath the serious notice of educated English people. But it is this very contempt which has brought about the change of opinion concerning them. It has been discovered that they were not altogether so absurd as they seemed; that the public mind, in its ignorance, has been unjust to them; and, in hasty repentance for that injustice, too many are ready to listen to those who will tell them that these things are not absurd at all--that there is no absurdity in believing that the leg-bone of St. Simon Stock may possess miraculous powers, or that the spirits of the departed communicate with their friends by rapping on the table. The ugly after-crop of superstition which is growing up among <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> the just and natural punishment of our materialism--I may say, of our practical atheism. For those who will not believe in the real spiritual world, in which each man's soul stands face to face all day long with Almighty God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, are sure at last to crave after some false spiritual world, and seek, like the evil and profligate generation of the Jews, after visible signs and material wonders. And those who will not believe that the one true and living God is above their path and about their bed and spieth out all their ways, and that in him they live and move and have their being, are but too likely at last to people with fancied saints and daemons that void in the imagination and in the heart which their own unbelief has made.|$|E
