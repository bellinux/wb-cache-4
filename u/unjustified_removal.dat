Among other contents, [...] "You are a terrorist" [...] and [...] "Electric Reporter" [...] were affected. During {{the course of the}} investigation into the case it was revealed that the removal of the content was not initiated by the association, but by the company OpSec Security, based in Munich. The authors Alexander Lehmann and Mario Sixtus were able to obtain an injunction against the company and the GVU has since explicitly distanced itself from the company. According to the GVU, OpSec Security had at no point been contracted to clear videos from Vimeo in its name.|$|E
40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Quick {{intraoperative}} parathormone assay (qPTHa) during paratyroidectomy {{has become}} a standard procedure for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). This paper aims to compare endoscopic bilateral neck exploration (BE) versus focused parathyroidectomy plus qPTHa during minimally invasive video-assisted parathyroidectomy (QM). The endpoints of the study are the mean operative time and outcome of the surgical procedure (PTH and calcemia normalization at one and six months postoperatively). METHODS: Forty patients with PHPT, positive to preoperative localization studies (ultrasonography evaluation and (99) Tc-MIBI scan) for a single parathyroid adenoma, were randomly allotted into two groups. In the first group (QM), 20 patients (17 women, three men, mean age 57. 6 years) underwent focused endoscopic parathyroidectomy (MIVAP tecnicque) plus qPTHa. In the second group (BE) 20 patients (17 women, three men, mean age 59. 6 years) underwent endoscopic parathyroidectomy plus bilateral exploration in order to check {{the integrity of the}} remaining glands. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences between}} groups at baseline. No conversion to cervicotomy was required. No postoperative complications were reported. The mean operative time was 32. 0 vs 33. 1 min [BE and QM group respectively, p = not significant (ns) ]. A second macroscopically enlarged gland was removed in four patients in the BE group. Only one out of four glands was reported to be hyperplastic in the final histology. All patients were discharged on the first postoperative day. Calcemia levels were normalized in all patient of both groups, despite persistently high level of serum PTH in one patient in the QM group. CONCLUSIONS: BE can be performed endoscopically, avoiding both the time necessary for qPTHa and its cost, with the same effectiveness, but might in few cases lead to the <b>unjustified</b> <b>removal</b> of parathyroid glands slightly enlarged but not necessarily pathologic...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Design phase {{decisions}} based on diagnosability lead to lower system costs and, in turn, higher quality products by means of reducing maintenance time and increasing system reliability. A case for diagnosability is presented. Functions of diagnosability are expounded upon including life cycle costs, statistical analysis, and design criterion to emphasize the necessity of diagnosability analysis early in the design phase. A diagnosability prediction metric is developed for system modeling of component failure rates and <b>unjustified</b> <b>removals.</b> The metric emphasizes ambiguity of system component indications as well as system structure. The metric is evaluated using historical data from the bleed air control system (BACS) on the Boeing 737 - 300. Seven design changes are suggested based on improving system diagnosability by changing component functions, modifying indications, and adding or changing sensors. The resulting designs are compared via Boeing's life cycle cost mechanism, DEPCOST model, based on cost improvements. It is shown that system improvements based on this prediction technique will increase {{the quality of a}} product since increased diagnosability decreases life cycle costs...|$|R
