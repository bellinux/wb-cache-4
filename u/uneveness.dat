40|$|In {{the course}} of human evolution, the anatomy of the body has been optimally adapted to static {{vertical}} loading. However, many of today’s professionals, such as truck or bus drivers, have to work under conditions of sustained low-level vibrations. The main reason why such vibrations lead to vertebral disc damage is that the muscles are unable {{to compensate for the}} cyclic loading imposed to the spine, and therefore cannot adequately protect the spine from the mechanical forces induced by these vertical vibrations. Especially long-term exposure to whole-body vibrations (WBV) in a driving environment contributes to early degeneration of the lumbar spinal system. In order to evaluate the effects of the vibration environment likely to be encounterd by professional drivers, a numerical simulation tool has been developed. Essential elements of the simulation system are a profile generator, a numerical model of a truck and a three-dimensional model of the human upper body including the head, spine and pelvis. The <b>uneveness</b> of the road in the longitudinal direction can be described mathematically by its spectral density. Based on the technique of autoregressive filters, a profile generator has been developed which {{is in a position to}} calculate arbitrary long profiles of roads satisfying given quality standards.

40|$|Economics {{during the}} fifties and sixties {{was marked by}} a {{substantial}} resurgence {{of interest in the}} theory of capital. While the advances during this period were very impressive, there was also an <b>uneveness</b> {{in the development of the}} subject. One-good models were studied in detail, as were many-good models of production-maximal growth and many-good models of consumption-optimal growth for the special case in which there is no social impatience. When treating heterogeneous capital, the literatures on decentralized or descriptive growth and consumption-optimal growth with positive time discounting were dominated by special cases and examples. Reliance on examples and special cases proved to have some unfortunate consequences. The Battle of the Two Cambridges, ostensibly an argument over approaches to modeling distribution and accumulation, often seemed to focus on the robustness (or lack of robustness) of certain “fundamental ” properties of the one-sector model and other worked-out examples when extended to more general heterogeneous-capital models. Furthermore, in large part because growth theory appeared to be an enterprise based only on proliferating special cases, the attention of the young able minds in the profession turned elsewhere, for example, to the-at least seemingly-more evenly-developed general equilibrium tradition. This is a shame. Intertemporal allocation and its relationship with the wealth of societies is one of the most important problems in our discipline. Growth models are natural vehicles for the study of what is called “temporary equilibrium. ” Dynamic models of multi-asset accumulation provide the theoretically most satisfactory environment for modeling the macroeconomics of income determination, employment, and inflation.

It is undoubtedly {{a major cause}} of road traffic accidents all over the world. Statistics show that one million killed and 50 million injured are reported every year by Competent Authorities. The effect of traffic noise has also become a critical public issue. On the road networking the surface characteristics of pavements also contributed to nearly 80 - 90 % of roadway traffic noise. Not only engines or exhaust systems generate noise. The impact of tire-surface at speeds above 50 km/h also needs to be added to prime offenders. Functional requirements such as roadway safety, environmental quality, driving comfort and operating costs in the road network are assessed by indicators whose limits are continuously adjusted. The roadway texture is again a main intervenient.

40|$|The {{main source}} of primary {{material}} on which this thesis is based is fieldwork carried out in Cajamarca, Peru, between February 1975 and September 1976. It concerns a former estate (haoienda), called Chala, {{in the province of}} Hualgayoco This had been an agricultural and live stock estate which had drawn on the labour services of its peasant tenants in production. Before the Land Reform, introduced in 1969 by the modernizing military regime of General Juan Velasco, there had been a series of struggles organized by the peasants against the landlord. At the time the land reform law was passed, the peasants were already in de facto control of the land, and violently resisted attempts to introduce a cooperative. The thesis includes a theoretical discussion of the highland estate system', and an analysis of the historical and regional context in which it operated. Regional variations in the agrarian structure are explained by reference to the demands created by the primary export sector (plantation agriculture and raining) for labour and foodstuffe. The <b>uneveness</b> of agricultural development within regions relates to the political and economic power of the landlords within the region and nationally The conclusions of my fieldwork are, that as far as the highland estates were concerned, the objectives of the Land Reform were political rather than economic. This is demonstrated by the utopian nature of cooperative plans for estates such as Chala, which were formulated without resources being provided for building infrastructure such as marketing systems, credit and technological inputs. However, the Land Reform has liberated the peasantry from the payment of the landlord's rent, and has thus made way for a fuller development of capitalist social relations in the countryside...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{asks the}} question: What is the {{relationship}} between poverty and globalisation in modern Australia? It is framed by an understanding of globalisation as one of the important and contentious legacies of the twentieth centuries. While an acceleration in the processes of globalisation may be responsible for unprecedented economic growth, at the same time. the divide between the "haves" and "have-nots" of society has widened to such an extent that, in Australia, we now have an underclass of approximately two million people. With poverty resurfacing as a major social issue in an era of comparative prosperity and low unemployment, many critics and theorists are questioning the ethics and practices associated with globalisation. Consisting of exegesis, "Have-Nots," and a novel, Deviations from the Perfect State, this thesis examines the nexus between poverty and globalisation and how the phenomena interact in modern Australia. Central to this research is an understanding of globalisation as a contemporary phase in the neoliberal model of capitalism, the development of which is not necessarily linear or representative of a single condition. Rather, globalisation can be best conceptualised as an interconnected network of concurrent transformation processes operating at many social, political and economic levels. If these processes have definable impacts all around the world, to view globalisation as global consolidation or integration is misleading. Although it is a global phenomenon, by reason of such factors as its complexity, its effects are highly differentiated, and this <b>uneveness</b> has fostered growing inequality between, and within, nation states. While inequality does not necessarily equate to poverty - though it can signal the phenomenon - there is evidence to suggest that, in its current nondemocratic form, globalisation will continue to affect people in different situations in different ways, at an alarming and ever increasing rate. This matter of uneven social outcomes is one of the principal focal points of the thesis, which argues that neoliberal-style globalisation perpetuates and/or generates poverty within Australian communities. The exegesis contends that this is evident via an examination of several related issues: the historical and socio-political circumstances under which poverty and globalisation have evolved; competing definitions of poverty and globalisation; and the debate in Australia colloquially known as the 'poverty wars. " Drawing on these and other related issues for its central themes and considerations, the accompanying novel offers a fictional context through which to view the arguments and findings discussed in the research component of the thesis. The mutually informing research methods of the exegesis and the novel are intended to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the relationship between poverty and globalisation, and the importance of equality, effective democracy and sustainable development as a means to justice for all Australians...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} statistical {{data on the}} publications of belles-lettres in Estonia in 1900 – 1940 – a period when the country developed into a modern European society and gained independence. The topic is treated {{in the context of}} book history, which uses publishing statistics to provide a broader context for individual case studies. The research on the quantity and share of translated literature in book production comes close to the statisticalsociological approach in translation history, characterised by Peeter Torop as one of the aspects of the study of translation culture. The statistical indicators have been elaborated on the basis of retrospective bibliographies and on the data, obtained from National Library of Estonia. The analysis includes the share of belles-lettres in book production, the balance of original works and translations, the changes in the quantity of translations during different decades and the share of source literatures. The Estonian statistics have been presented in comparison with corresponding data from Finland, which has been published in the collective monograph on Finnish translation history, issued in 2007. As the Finnish data is organized by decades, the same principle is used for statistics on Estonia. This approach corresponds generally to the political history of the two countries – both belonged to the Russian Empire during the first two decades of the 20 th century and existed as independent states during the following two decades. Both nations had passed through the first stage in the development of literary culture, characterised by extensive publication of adaptations and free translations {{by the beginning of the}} century. Thus the share of original works started to increase and slightly exceeded the share  of  translations  in  E stonia  as  well  as  in  Finland.  The  selection  of  translated  works  in both countries was varied and their level was unstable. Despite the longstanding plans of developing translation culture in Finland, the choice of works was influenced by international acclaime and the activitiy of translators. The immaturity of Estonian publishing manifested itself, among other things, as inadeaquate paratexts of the translations. Due to the differences in historical development and cultural background, the structure of  source  literature s  of  translated  belle s-let tre s  in  the  two  countrie s  dif fered  in  many  ways – translating from the English language increased considerably in Finland, fending the traditional German and Scandinavian domination. The importance of translations of German literature, which maintained the leading role in Estonia, is a common feature of both countries. At the same time, the interest in Scandinavian literature only started to emerge in Estonia. The  translations  of  Rus sian  literature,  however,  were  much  more  numerous  in  E stonia  thanin Finland. In general, the period of 1900 – 1919 is characterised by a notable increase in the quantit y of translated belles-lettres as well as their <b>uneveness.</b> However, the growing number of translations provided greater diversity, introducing new authors, styles and trends. The existence of an independent Republic of Estonia (since 1918) opened utterly new perspectives for the development of national culture – for the first time it could be done without external control and using the Estonian language in all levels of administration and education. These circumstances fostered publishing, the demand for books was especially great during the first years after the War of Independence (1918 – 1920), later the declines and increases in book production were connected to the economic conditions. Belles-lettres formed about 20 per cent of the title production, which in turn was almost equally divided between original works and translations. In contrast to Estonia, the number of translations started to decrease in Finland in the 1930 s due to economic and political factors, idealising conservative national values. The hierarchy of source languages underwent a major change in Estonia where the English language ascended to the leading position, exceeding the translations from German and French. The importance of translations from Russian language remained a characteristic feature of Estonian publishing, unknown in Finland during the 1920 s- 1930 s. Estonians were also active in translating Finnish literature. The Estonian publishing houses issued ten times more translations from Finnish than vice versa – a disproportion explained with the lack of interest among the Finnish publishers. Although the output of  translations  included  a  wide  variet y  of  high-qualit y  works,  they  were  outnumbered  by genre fiction, preferred by the large audiences both in Estonia and in Finland. The Writer’s Unions of Estonia and Finland attempted to suppress their proliferation without success. However, on the whole, the corpus of translations issued in the 1920 s and 1930 s presents a rather balanced selection oriented to different strata of the audience...|$|E
40|$|THE ITALIAN SCHOOL OF ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY AND ABEL’S LEGACY ALDO BRIGAGLIA, CIRO CILIBERTO, AND CLAUDIO PEDRINI Introduction Exactly one century ago, in {{the spring}} of 1902, the prestigious {{mathematical}} journal Acta Mathematica, decided to mark the centenary of Abel’s birth by dedicating three issues to the memory of this Norwegian mathematician. Some of the most influential Italian mathematician of the day were invited to contribute to these issues. Among those invited were Guido Catelnuovo, at the time the most well-known representative of the Italian school of algebraic geometry, and Federigo Enriques. Enriques, at first, accepted the invitation and, as he communicated to Castelnuovo, decided to write [...] . una specie di Bericht, breve, intorno ai nostri lavori, in cui mi propongo di esporre la teoria sotto l’aspetto analitico. ( [...] . a kind of Bericht, a short one, concerning our papers, in which I would like to expose the theory using the analytic viewpoint.) (letter of 13 / 3 / 1902, for all citations from the correspondence between Enriques and Castelnuovo, see [BCG]). The project was never completed. However this short citation is important for us: it tells us, in fact, that the Italian algebraic geometers, at the beginning of last century, used to look at their connections with Abel via analytic and transcendantal methods. Although never really central in the Italian school were, this attitude was always considered as a natural counterpart of the projective-geometric aspects typical of the Italians. Furthermore, as we will see, at the time Enriques was writing, there was in Italy an important revival of analytic ideas. In this paper we will try to make clear an interesting set of contributions which, inside the Italian school, were, in Enriques’ sense, inspired by Abel’s analytic viewpoint. For this we will go back to the real beginning of the italian school with Luigi Cremona, who is considered to be its founder. Then we will follow the evolution of these ideas up until the 1930 ’s and we will indicate how they are thought of today. Abel, apparently, never had any contact with the Italian mathematical environment,in his short life, nor even specifically during his travels to Italy (see [St]). Therefore, his influence on Italian mathematicians was late and indirect. However, we believe that, despite this, it has been deep and longstanding. In the first chapter we will give an overview of the influence of Abel’s ideas on the beginnings of the Italian school, filtered via Riemann’s viewpoint and the geometric interpretation of it by Clebsch and Gordan, and later by Brill and Noether. This chapter mainly centers around the character of Luigi Cremona, the founder of the Italian school. In the second chapter we will see how Abel’s influence was still active {{at the beginning of the}} XXth century and played a basic role in understanding the notion of irregularity of surfaces. The main characters, in this period, are the young Severi and the well established Caselnuovo, whose contributions we will review, indicating also their subsequent far reaching influence inside and outside the Italian school, until A. Weil’s proof of Riemann’s hypotheses for the zeta function of an algebraic curve over a finite field. The third chapter is devoted to Severi’s ideas on rational equivalence of 0 -cycles on a surface. We will indicate how some of these ideas were related, in Severi’s mind, to Abel’s viewpoint. As is well known, Severi’s contributions on the subject have been very controversial. We will briefly report on the main criticisms but we will also try to elucidate which of them have a present validity. In particular we will direct our, and we hope the reader’s attention, to some of his ideas which are very closely related to Bloch’s conjecture. We dedicate a few, more technical, sections at the end of chapter 3 to open a window on the present developments of this last subject, specifically to some motivic interpretations which we think are rather close to Severi’s original viewpoint. Due to the different tastes and attitudes of the authors, which we deliberately did not make too much effort to hide, the paper is rather uneven. The first chapter is expository and more historiographical in nature. The other two, though sharing with the first a historiographical perspective, have a different flavour: in the second some technical aspects start to appear, and they become even more relevant in chapter 3, especially, as we said, in its last sections. We hope that the <b>uneveness</b> of the paper will attract, rather than repel, readers with different interests...|$|E
