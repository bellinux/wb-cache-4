40|$|Events in Zimbabwe during {{seven years}} {{from the start of}} {{economic}} reforms in 1991 have highlighted the contradictions in the ideologies <b>underlying</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> and institutional reform in the country. They have also highlighted the futility of undertaking partial reforms. Zimbabwe embarked on liberalization of its foreign exchange, banking, marketing and pricing policies in the early 1990 s. However, the fiscal deficits continued to increase, and key resource allocation systems remained centrally controlled. The gains from liberalization have been disappointing. The benefits were undermined by high inflation and interest rates caused by excessive government borrowing. High interest rates, together with the rigidities that prevent resources from moving efficiently, make investor response to the liberalized markets very difficult and haphazard. The uncertainty created by conflicting messages portrayed in the rhetoric and actions of the government further reduce investor confidence. This paper traces some of the emerging political and institutional forces that have influenced economic policy and considers the success, constraints and potential for agriculture in Zimbabwe.

40|$|The {{promotion}} of the tourism sector as {{a means by which}} to achieve social and economic development objectives is well established, and is reflective of a broader movement internationally towards the active support of ‘sunrise’ industries in regional locations (e. g., Beer, Maude & Pritchard, 2003). The utilisation of the tourism sector for this purpose has become increasingly salient over the past two decades, particularly in rural or provincial areas, where the sector has been used by governments to help offset declining profitability in other sectors of regional economies. These declines are attributed most commonly in the academic literature to a change in public policy ideology influenced strongly by economic neoliberalism (e. g., Dredge, 2005; Mair, 2006). This thesis examines how and why local government utilises tourism development as a mechanism for fostering regional development. It does so by providing a theoretical perspective on the changing role of local government in regional tourism development under an evolving public policy paradigm. To achieve this, the thesis utilises a single case study of the Hurunui District, New Zealand. The rationale for selecting local government as the unit of investigation is that it is at the local level that the impacts of tourism are experienced most acutely. That is to say, in destination areas it is typically local government (i. e., territorial local authorities) which has the primary responsibility for the management of natural, cultural and built resources, the management of tourist behaviour, and also the {{promotion of}} destination area attractions and activities (e. g., funding for regional tourism promotional organisations, festivals, events). No other level of government in New Zealand has such a high level of direct and/or indirect institutional responsibility for the management and {{promotion of the}} tourism sector, and the management of destination areas and communities. This case study approach is framed within an interpretative social sciences methodological paradigm, and seeks to integrate a New Regionalism and Foucauldian perspective for the purposes of analysis. The primary research method employed in this thesis is a series of 35 semi-structured interviews with key informants from 19 agencies, organisations, and stakeholder groups associated with or impacted by tourism development in the case study location. These, in turn, are set against information collated from documents relating to the history of sectoral change and development in the Hurunui District, as well as an examination of the structures of tourism governance in the District. The Hurunui District is rural in character and has strong historical and economic connections with the agricultural sector. These agricultural connections have more recently been complemented by the growing prominence of the District’s emergent tourism sector. This recent addition to the economic palette of the area has been strongly championed by the territorial local authority with municipal responsibility for the case study area: the Hurunui District Council. This role of tourism ‘champion’ has been strengthened further by its position as owner-operator of the District’s premier tourism attraction: the Hanmer Springs Thermal Pools and Spa (HSTPS). The findings of this research confirm the view of much of the international literature insofar as tourism is viewed (and used) as a mechanism to stimulate regional economies and offset the declining profitability of other sectors in rural locations. The use of tourism for this purpose has, in turn, led to a change in public sector roles and responsibilities for tourism at the local level as authorities attempt to stave off socio-economic hardship in regional locations. This has created a reconfiguration of public sector, private sector, and community relations in the sphere of tourism promotion, participation, and development. Sitting alongside this issue is the challenge for local government to manage the urgency of an <b>underlying</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> imperative while also remaining a benevolent and impartial provider of public facilities and amenities. This appears to be a particularly contentious issue in the case study location, as the District Council is engaged in what is arguably an extended programme of municipal enterprise via the tourism industry. This has created a pluralism whereby the District Council is not only a promoter and benefactor of tourism development, and an arbiter and enforcer of District planning rules and the like, but is also a leading beneficiary of increased tourism activity in the District. This, in turn, has led to divergent and contested understandings about the appropriate role of local government in tourism development. Thus, the promotion of tourism development in the Hurunui District, while certainly beneficial with respect to ameliorating the immediate effects of regional decline, nonetheless reveals areas of potential fracture in Council–community relations...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results and}} {{implications}} of an application of dynamic simulation modeling {{to the study of}} control of social unrest in a developing country are presented. The model demonstrates the use of a multiple-objective, multiple-group objective function designed to monitor the "pressure level" of social unrest in the modeled system. An outline of the model structure is presented and sample relationships are explained in detail to demonstrate the dynamic and feedback nature of the model. The paper then presents some of the recommendations and their managerial and public policy implications derived from a policy analysis of the model. The analysis, for instance, reveals that a program designed to achieve the highest possible economic growth rate could adversely affect the society's stability in the long run. The study, in addition, finds that an extensive income redistribution program, designed to tax the rich more heavily and to substantially increase the minimum income of the poor, proves to be myopic while an extensive wealth redistribution program is shown to bring about a significant and sustained improvement in the system's stability. These results raise serious questions on much of the attitudes that <b>underlie</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> and income redistribution programs in countries like India, Brazil, the Philippines and, to some extent, the United States. ...|$|R

40|$|National averages conceal {{powerful}} interactions <b>underlying</b> English <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> in {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries. The simplest operational divisions are north, south and London. Initially industry and business culture predominated in the south but this culture was seduced by the gentry lifestyle and entrepreneurship redirected towards producing food and transporting it to London. The twin attractions of landed society and the London food market caused manufacturing to atrophy: the south deindustrialised. In the north a business culture expanded, capital having come into the hands of small farmers in Lancashire and Cheshire during the sixteenth-century rise in food prices. Entrepreneurship and skills were also fostered by religious independence, accompanied by only limited conspicuous consumption. Four main industries developed: metal working (especially clock- and watchmaking), cheese making, salt production and cotton manufacturing. But the mechanisation of cotton lagged because it was unacceptable to throw large numbers of hand spinners out of work. The technical challenge was minor compared with clock- and watchmaking, from which skills were borrowed by cotton manufacturers once demand began to expand fast. ...|$|R

40|$|Explaining uneven <b>economic</b> {{growth and}} <b>development</b> within a country or {{a state or}} even within a {{metropolitan}} area has drawn attention of many scholars as well as public officials around the world. Most of the theories proposed so far {{have not been able}} to explain clearly the processes that <b>underlie</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> and growth, making them unsuitable for policy actions. Regional planners and government officials are more interested in identifying factors that drive <b>economic</b> growth and <b>development</b> at the local or regional level. This paper explores regional factors as determinants of new firm formations (hereafter, NF 2) that are central to the phenomenon of <b>economic</b> growth and <b>development.</b> Specifically, it explores regional factors as determinants of NF 2 for the Texas manufacturing sector for the 1976 - 91 period. All twenty-seven (27) Texas metropolitan areas have been used to account for the variation in NF 2 over time and space. The results are of practical importance to policy makers, economists, and would be entrepreneurs alike. In the absence of specific theories of new firm formations, this study draws on neoclassical theory as well as ideas of Adam Smith, Alfred Marshall, and Joseph Schumpeter. A historical evaluation of entrepreneurs and associated entrepreneurial innovations is carried out to better understand the role of entrepreneurship in influencing <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> and growth in the present context. Empirical studies of new firm formations, though mostly from European countries, have been reviewed to get a first hand look at current status of research in the area. The problem of appropriate data with which one can measure the key processes undergirding economic dynamism and change is explained in detail. In this context, relative superiority of the data set used in this study to the data sets used in most of the previous empirical studies is explained in greater depth. Using Hicks' micro-level data on establishment entries and exits, this study develops pooled time-series data on entries and exits of firms collected over a period of 16 years (1976 - 91) using sales tax files for the manufacturing sector. The issues of: (1) the treatment of missing data, (2) the selection of referents for regional and time dummy variables, and (3) violations and remedies of OLS assumptions (heteroscedasticity, multicollinearity, and serial correlation) are addressed to maximize the reliability of regression models developed for further analysis. Fixed-effects regression models with region and time as dummy variables have been formulated to control for region-specific and time-specific influences, respectively. The fixed-effects models are estimated using two different regression estimation techniques, robust regression and estimated weighted least squares. Time-series analyses is employed to test for ten hypotheses proposed, one for each variable included in the model. All regression results are found to be consistent with their respective hypothesis. Robust regression model results indicated a positive and independent influence of mean establishment size, entry rate, exit rate, and per capita bank deposits on NF 2; whereas change in unemployment rate indicated a negative influence on NF 2. The empirical findings provide strong support for the role of deep churning - turnover and replacement in a business base - in understanding the forces shaping <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> and growth. Moreover, the findings provide a counterpoint to neoclassical theory by suggesting a symbiotic, rather than an adversarial, relationship between small and large firms. ...|$|R

Recently, the spotlight has been put on the private equity industry for a number of reasons: the recent financial crisis; the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the U. S. and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive in the E. U.; and the run of Mitt Romney, founder of the prestigious U.

Patterns of fast followership become evident as a result of detailed industry case study analysis – as conducted in this paper on the FPD industry – and in a dynamic, disequilibrium analytical framework.
