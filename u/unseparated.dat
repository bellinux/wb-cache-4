By {{the end of}} the eighth division, most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division, the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the germ line from the syncytium. Finally, after the 13th division, cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed, gastrulation starts.|$|E

500|$|Adult sponges lack neurons or {{any other}} kind of nervous tissue. However most species have the ability to perform {{movements}} that are coordinated all over their bodies, mainly contractions of the pinacocytes, squeezing the water channels and thus expelling excess sediment and other substances that may cause blockages. Some species can contract the osculum independently {{of the rest of the}} body. Sponges may also contract in order to reduce the area that is vulnerable to attack by predators. In cases where two sponges are fused, for example if there is a large but still <b>unseparated</b> bud, these contraction waves slowly become coordinated in both of the [...] "Siamese twins". The coordinating mechanism is unknown, but may involve chemicals similar to neurotransmitters. However glass sponges rapidly transmit electrical impulses through all parts of the syncytium, and use this to halt the motion of their flagella if the incoming water contains toxins or excessive sediment. Myocytes are thought to be responsible for closing the osculum and for transmitting signals between different parts of the body.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{formation}} and functioning of a mitotic spindle depends {{not only on}} the assembly/disassembly of microtubules but also on the action of motor enzymes. Cytoplasmic dynein has been localized to spindles, but whether or how it functions in mitotic processes is not yet known. We have cloned and expressed DNA fragments that encode the putative ATPhydrolytic sites of the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain from HeLa cells and from Dictyostelium. Monospecific antibodies have been raised to the resulting polypeptides, and these inhibit dynein motor activity in vitro. Their injection into mitotic mammalian cells blocks the formation of spindles in prophase or during recovery from nocodazole treatment at later stages of mitosis.

This case can make anxiety for them. This problem can affect people because it will decrease productivity. Objective: This study aimed to determine differences in the level of anxiety among professional nurses with vocational nurse at the General Hospital Kumala Siwi Kudus Methods: The method uses observational analytic design with cross sectional approach. Number of sample were 26 respondents from nurse professional and 26 from nurse vocational who met the restriction criteria, by using a purposive sampling technique. Then respondents fill out the instrument to get data. Data were analyzed by unpaired t test. Results: Obtain result p = 0. 001 (< 0. 05), which means statistically significant. The mean value of professional nurse is 22, 73 and 18, 23 of vocational nurse were professional nurse more have high anxiety level than vocational nurse. Conclusions: There are differences in the level of anxiety among professional nurses with vocational nurses in General Hospital Kumala Siwi Kudus, were professional nurse have higher anxiety level than vocational nurse...|$|R

2500|$|Due to the {{influence}} of the Roman Catholic Church in the west, where the English language itself developed, the words [...] "catholic" [...] and [...] "catholicity" [...] are sometimes used to refer to that church specifically. However, the more prominent dictionary sense given for general use is still the one shared by other languages, implying breadth and universality, reflecting comprehensive scope. In a Christian context, the Church, as identified with the original Church founded by Christ and His apostles, is said to be catholic (or universal) in regard to its union with Christ in faith. Just as Christ is indivisible, so are union with Him and faith in Him, whereby the Church is [...] "universal", <b>unseparated,</b> and comprehensive, including all who share that faith. Orthodox Bishop Kallistos Ware has called that [...] "simple Christianity".

40|$|AbstractMetal {{complexes}} of gliclazide (GLZ; HL) drug {{are prepared}} and characterized based on elemental analyses, IR, diffused reflectance, magnetic moment, molar conductance and thermal analyses (TG and DTG) technique. From the elemental analyses data, the complexes are proposed {{to have the}} general formulae [M(HL) Cl 3 (H 2 O) ]· 3 H 2 O (M=Cr(III) and Fe(III)), [M(HL) Cl 2 (H 2 O) 2]·yH 2 O (M=Co(III), Ni(II) and Cu(II), y= 0 – 2) and [M(HL) Cl 2]·yH 2 O (M=Mn(II) and Zn(II), y= 0 – 1). The molar conductance data reveal that all the metal chelates are non-electrolytes. IR spectra show that GLZ is coordinated to the metal ions in a neutral bidentate manner with ON donor sites of the amide-O and sulphonamide-OH. From the magnetic and solid reflectance spectra, {{it is found that}} the geometrical structures of these complexes are octahedral (Cr(III), Fe(III), Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II)) and tetrahedral (Mn(II) and Zn(II)). The thermal behaviour of these chelates is studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TG and DTG) techniques. The results obtained show that the hydrated complexes lose water molecules of hydration followed immediately by decomposition of the anions and ligand molecules in the successive <b>unseparate</b> steps. The activation thermodynamic parameters are calculated using Coats–Redfern method. The GLZ drug, in comparison to its metal complexes also is screened for their biological activity against house fly, Musca domestica (Diptera – Muscidae). Dose of 5 μg/insect of gliclazide is typically applied against 3 days-old larval instar of M. domestica. Survival of pupal and adult stages has been affected by the complexes of gliclazide more than larval instars. Morphogenic abnormalities of larvae, pupae and adults are studied. On the other hand, pupation and adult emergence program is deteriorated by the effect of different chemicals...|$|R

6000|$|The amiable youth {{then looked}} out, {{as it had}} first struck Strether, at a world in respect to which he hadn't a prejudice. The one our friend most {{instantly}} missed was the usual one in favour of an occupation accepted. Little Bilham had an occupation, {{but it was only}} an occupation declined; and it was by his general exemption from alarm, anxiety or remorse on this score that the impression of his serenity was made. He had come out to Paris to paint--to fathom, that is, at large, that mystery; but study had been fatal to him so far as anything COULD be fatal, and his productive power faltered in proportion as his knowledge grew. Strether had gathered from him that at the moment of his finding him in Chad's rooms he hadn't saved from his shipwreck a scrap of anything but his beautiful intelligence and his confirmed habit of Paris. He referred to these things with an equal fond familiarity, and it was sufficiently clear that, as an outfit, they still served him. They were charming to Strether through the hour spent at the Louvre, where indeed they figured for him as an <b>unseparated</b> part of the charged iridescent air, the glamour of the name, the splendour of the space, the colour of the masters. Yet they were present too wherever the young man led, and the day after the visit to the Louvre they hung, in a different walk, about the steps of our party. He had invited his companions to cross the river with him, offering to show them his own poor place; and his own poor place, which was very poor, gave to his idiosyncrasies, for Strether--the small sublime indifference and independences that had struck the latter as fresh--an odd and engaging dignity. He lived {{at the end of an}} alley that went out of an old short cobbled street, a street that went in turn out of a new long smooth avenue--street and avenue and alley having, however, in common a sort of social shabbiness; and he introduced them to the rather cold and blank little studio which he had lent to a comrade for the term of his elegant absence. The comrade was another ingenuous compatriot, to whom he had wired that tea was to await them [...] "regardless," [...] and this reckless repast, and the second ingenuous compatriot, and the faraway makeshift life, with its jokes and its gaps, its delicate daubs and its three or four chairs, its overflow of taste and conviction and its lack of nearly all else--these things wove round the occasion a spell to which our hero unreservedly surrendered.|$|E
