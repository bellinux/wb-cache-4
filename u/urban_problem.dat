40|$|Abstract—Urban {{problems}} are problems of organized complexity. Thus, many models and scientific methods to resolve <b>urban</b> <b>problems</b> are failed. This study {{is concerned with}} proposing of a fuzzy system driven approach for classification and solving <b>urban</b> <b>problems.</b> The proposed study investigated mainly {{the selection of the}} inputs and outputs of urban systems for classification of <b>urban</b> <b>problems.</b> In this research, five categories of <b>urban</b> <b>problems,</b> respect to fuzzy system approach had been recognized: control, polytely, optimizing, open and decision making problems. Grounded Theory techniques were then applied to analyze the data and develop new solving method for each category. The findings indicate that the fuzzy system methods are powerful processes and analytic tools for helping planners to resolve <b>urban</b> complex <b>problems.</b> These tools can be successful where as others have failed because both incorporate or address uncertainty and risk; complexity and systems interacting with other systems.

To be a creative city the soft infrastructure includes: a highly skilled and flexible labour force; dynamic thinkers, creators and implementers. Creativity is not only about having ideas, but also the capacity to implement them.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue of}} {{affordable}} housing concerns New Yorkers as a community overall, with more than 90% believing that everyone {{has a right to}} shelter. With the recent recession and increasing housing costs, {{it is not surprising that}} more than 30% of New York City residents fear they may one day be homeless. Affordable housing is a major <b>urban</b> <b>problem</b> facing New York City. Poverty concentrated neighborhoods tend to have poor quality housing stock, higher crime rates, higher dropout rates, and inadequate access to economic opportunities. For residents earning below the 50% median income, only 18% of all rental units and just 4% of market rate rental units were considered affordable in 2009. New York City must address its declining amount {{of affordable housing}} as well as increase its sustainability and access to opportunity.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{criminal}} activity in rural America, particularly drug-related activity, by analysing trends in offending for four rural communities of the mid-west. The present study has three main objectives. First, discover how many offences in these rural areas are drug-related offences. Second, discover differential offending, with an emphasis on drug offending, based on location of each area of study. 1 Third, uncover overall trends of offending in each of the rural communities examined. For the last approximately ten years rural offending has become a major concern for many criminal justice practitioners in ‘small town America’. While drug offending is a major concern nation-ally, predominantly due to all of the media exposure related to the <b>urban</b> <b>problem,</b> it is growing as a concern of rural Americans.
