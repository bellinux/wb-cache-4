5|$|Beyond that, {{the highway}} {{remained}} <b>unaltered</b> {{until it was}} transferred, or downloaded, to Simcoe County on January1, 1998.|$|E
5|$|Highway23 {{remained}} <b>unaltered</b> between 1934 and 1998. On January1, 1998, {{the section}} from the Highway89 junction west of Palmerston to Highway 9 in Teviotdale was decommissioned, {{resulting in the}} northern terminus of Highway23 becoming the western terminus of Highway89.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the {{trunkline}} {{running through}} Boyne City was originally labeled M-57. In 1927, the entire highway was renumbered, and since this change, the trunkline has carried the M-75 moniker. The M-75 designation was left <b>unaltered</b> when US27 between Gaylord and Indian River was {{converted to a}} freeway; this freeway was redesignated as I-75 in 1962. Some states, such as California, do not allow two highways in their state to carry the same highway number, {{which is not the}} case in Michigan. A reconstruction project in 1966 bypassed some sharp curves in the roadway and straightened sections between Boyne City and Walloon Lake. As of 2008, the highway remains <b>unaltered</b> since the reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{is listed}} in good {{condition}} and she remains mostly <b>unaltered,</b> adhering to her World War II era configuration. Former crewmembers have held reunions each year since the ship was decommissioned, with the 65th annual reunion taking place in June 2010.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists {{have named}} an extinct {{bandicoot}} from the Miocene of Australia after the character, Crash bandicoot. Although somewhat {{unusual for the}} scientific community, the name was used in an entirely <b>unaltered</b> form, without attempting to return to Latin or Greek roots.|$|E
5|$|Second Street Historic District: Many <b>unaltered</b> homes {{dating to}} the 1820s, some of them owned by {{prominent}} city residents, {{in the vicinity of}} the Troy Savings Bank building.|$|E
5|$|Dating {{from the}} 7th century to 1522, Ripon Cathedral {{preserves}} the crypt {{of the original}} church built by Saint Wilfred. The west front is an <b>unaltered</b> and harmonious composition in Early English Gothic. The choir has retained richly carved 14th-century stalls, famous for the many lively figures among the carvings.|$|E
5|$|During presidential elections, {{candidates}} may advertise on the Internet {{except on}} the eve of polling day and polling day itself. However, on those days, it remains legal for people to convey their own political views on a non-commercial basis to others by telephonic or electronic transmission, and election advertising may remain <b>unaltered</b> on the Internet if it was lawfully published before the eve of polling day.|$|E
5|$|Recorded at Sunrise Studios, Kirchberg, Switzerland in July and August, 1980. Tracks 1, 4 {{and the end}} {{of track}} 2 were {{recorded}} live at a Massacre concert at CBGB in New York City, April 1980, and were later altered and added to in Switzerland; track 6 is an <b>unaltered</b> improvised piece from the same concert.|$|E
5|$|Since its introduction, the Roosevelt dime {{has been}} struck {{continuously}} in large numbers. The Mint transitioned from striking the coin in silver to base metal in 1965, {{and the design}} remains essentially <b>unaltered</b> from when Sinnock created it. Without rare dates or silver content, the dime is less widely sought by coin collectors than other modern U.S. coins.|$|E
5|$|The Bristol County Jail {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The jail is {{significant}} as a relatively <b>unaltered</b> historic jail that was important to the 18th-century Bristol County. It is also significant in that it currently serves as the home of the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society. The Society also houses its library and collections in the jail and runs a small museum shop from the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{route and}} {{surroundings}} of former Highway36 have largely remained <b>unaltered</b> since the highway was decommissioned in 1998. Within the City of Kawartha Lakes, {{the road is}} now known as Kawartha Lakes Road36, while within the County of Peterborough, it is known as Peterborough County Road36.|$|E
5|$|The {{table of}} {{characteristics}} provided by Lt. Jurrien S. Noot for the 19 April 1940 design {{does not give}} any armament specifics, as these likely remained <b>unaltered</b> from the earlier 16 February 1940 drawing. This drawing provided the following: a main armament of nine 283mm guns, a secondary armament of twelve 120mm dual purpose guns, and an anti-aircraft defense consisting of fourteen Bofors 40mmguns and eight Oerlikon 20mmcannons.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} cats is {{referred}} to as a clowder or a glaring, a male cat is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered), an <b>unaltered</b> female is called a queen, and a juvenile cat {{is referred to}} as a kitten. The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed cat, is its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now obsolete word catling.|$|E
5|$|After {{operating}} {{only during}} peak hours {{for more than}} 30years, the closure announcement came on 4 January 1993. The original 1907 lifts required replacement {{at a cost of}} £3million. This was not considered justifiable in relation to the passenger numbers using the station and it was losing London Regional Transport £150,000 per year. The Secretary of State for Transport granted permission on 1 September 1994 to close the station and the branch closed on 30 September. Recognising the station's historical significance as a mostly <b>unaltered</b> station from the early 20th century, the station was given Grade II listed building status in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Although Dickinson's acquaintances {{were most}} likely aware of her writing, {{it was not until}} after her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, {{discovered}} her cache of poems—that the breadth of her work became apparent to the public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content. A complete, and mostly <b>unaltered,</b> collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The Poems of Emily Dickinson in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Between the 2:3 and 1:2 {{resonances}} with Neptune, {{at approximately}} 42–48AU, the gravitational interactions with Neptune occur {{over an extended}} timescale, and objects can exist with their orbits essentially <b>unaltered.</b> This region {{is known as the}} classical Kuiper belt, and its members comprise roughly two thirds of KBOs observed to date. Because the first modern KBO discovered, , is considered the prototype of this group, classical KBOs are often referred to as cubewanos ("Q-B-1-os"). The guidelines established by the IAU demand that classical KBOs be given names of mythological beings associated with creation.|$|E
5|$|Local Methodists reputedly {{met in a}} {{house on}} Town Street until a chapel {{was built in the}} 1860s. Middleton Methodist Chapel was built in 1896 {{replacing}} a chapel built 30 years earlier by the Wesleyans. It was designed by Howdill and Howdill and built in brick. It has a tower to the north west and large west window. The interior survives largely <b>unaltered</b> and has a barrel-vaulted ceiling. There is a Baptist church on Middleton Park Avenue. St Philip's Roman Catholic Church, a modern building, is situated on St Philip's Avenue.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April 1941, during World War II {{the station}} was heavily damaged in an air raid. Much of the {{building}} was destroyed and the tracks to the station were rendered unusable. Although some funeral trains continued to run from nearby Waterloo station, the London terminus was never used again. Following {{the end of the}} war the London Necropolis Company decided that reopening the London Necropolis Railway was not financially worthwhile, and the surviving part of the station building was sold as office space. This remnant remains intact, and relatively <b>unaltered</b> since its opening.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} in two parts: sub-surface platforms, opened in 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway {{as part of}} the company's {{extension}} of the Inner Circle route from Paddington to South Kensington and to Westminster; and deep-level platforms opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway. A variety of underground and main line services have operated over the sub-surface tracks. The deep-level platforms have remained largely <b>unaltered</b> with no lift access. A disused sub-surface platform features periodic art installations as part of Transport for London's Art on the Underground scheme.|$|E
5|$|Tourist inflow into Darjeeling {{had been}} {{affected}} by the political instability in the region, and agitations in the 1980s and 2000s hit the tourism industry hard. However, post 2012, Darjeeling has once again witnessed a steady inflow of both domestic and international tourists. Presently, around 50,000 foreign and 500,000 domestic tourists visit Darjeeling each year, and its repute as the 'Queen of the Hills' remains <b>unaltered.</b> According to an India Today survey published on 23 December 2015, Darjeeling is the third most googled travel destination among all the tourist spots in India.|$|E
5|$|Various {{sources of}} sharia {{are used by}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} to elucidate the body of Islamic law. The primary source accepted universally by all Muslims is the Qur'an, the majority adhering also to the traditionally reported Sunnah, but rejected by others; Quranism. The Qur'an is the holy scripture of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the direct and <b>unaltered</b> word of God. The Sunnah consists of the alleged religious actions and quotations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, narrated through his Companions and the Imams (per the beliefs of the Sunni and Shi'ite schools respectively).|$|E
5|$|While rare on Earth, {{silicon carbide}} is remarkably common in space. It {{is a common}} form of {{stardust}} found around carbon-rich stars, and examples of this stardust {{have been found in}} pristine condition in primitive (<b>unaltered)</b> meteorites. The silicon carbide found in space and in meteorites is almost exclusively the beta-polymorph. Analysis of SiC grains found in the Murchison meteorite, a carbonaceous chondrite meteorite, has revealed anomalous isotopic ratios of carbon and silicon, indicating an origin from outside the solar system; 99% of these SiC grains originate around carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars. SiC is commonly found around these stars as deduced from their infrared spectra.|$|E
5|$|Before the Washington Naval Conference concluded, the ship's {{construction}} was suspended in February 1922, {{when she was}} 24.2 percent complete. She was re-designated and re-authorized as an aircraft carrier on 1 July 1922. Her displacement was reduced {{by a total of}} , achieved mainly by the elimination of her main armament of eight 16-inch (406mm) guns in four twin turrets (including their heavy turret mounts, their armor, and other equipment). The main armor belt was retained, but was reduced in height to save weight. The general line of the hull remained <b>unaltered,</b> as did the torpedo protection system, because they had already been built, {{and it would have been}} too expensive to alter them.|$|E
5|$|By 1997, Martin had met Classics student Tim Rice-Oxley. During {{a weekend}} in the English village Virginia Water in Surrey they asked each other to play their own songs on the piano. Martin, finding Rice-Oxley to be talented, asked him to be Coldplay's {{keyboard}} player but Rice-Oxley refused as his own band, Keane, was already active. Days after, this event would shape the second line-up of Keane and keep Coldplay's <b>unaltered,</b> thus leaving both bands as quartets. In 1998, the band released 500 copies of the Safety EP. Most of the discs were given to record companies and friends; only 50 copies remained for sale to the public. In December of that year, Coldplay signed to the independent label Fierce Panda. Their first release was the three-track Brothers and Sisters EP, which they had quickly recorded over four days in February 1999.|$|E
5|$|Davide Cassani won {{the fifteenth}} stage that {{featured}} a summit finish to Lumezzane, while the general classification remained largely <b>unaltered.</b> The next day of racing saw {{a break from}} the mountains, with a primarily flat course that stretched from Varazze to Pontechianale. The stage ultimately finished with a bunch sprint that was won by Italian Fabio Baldato. The Giro's seventeenth stage concluded with a summit finish to Chianale. Marco Saligari won the stage by over a minute on the second-place finisher Gianluca Bortolami, while the general classification contenders finished together leaving the classification largely unchanged. Stage eighteen was a primarily flat stage that closed with a field sprint. Adriano Baffi won the field sprint and the stage, which was his third stage victory at the Giro that year.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the stylistic}} {{innovations}} Radama adopted {{for the construction}} of several of the compound's buildings, the Rova largely retained its traditional features during his reign. The basic layout of the compound remained largely <b>unaltered</b> from its original design with the sole exception of an expansion of the Rova along its north-south axis. Stone walls topped with sharpened wooden stakes were built around the new perimeter during this period. Venerable buildings such as Besakana, Nanjakana, Mahitsy and Manjakamiadana were retained, as were the houses of several of Andrianampoinimerina's wives, many of whom were still living at the time of Radama's death in 1828. During his reign, Radama undertook the restoration of Marivolanitra to serve chiefly as housing for visiting foreigners, and briefly inhabited it himself in addition to his main residence at Besakana. He also had a house called Kelisoa ("Petite Beauty") built as a lodging for his concubines.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began at}} the National Museum Cardiff, which doubled for the history museum {{depicted}} in the episode's first scene. To portray the tunnel the bus travelled into, the Queen's Gate Tunnel of the A4232 road in Butetown was closed for four nights to accommodate filming. The last major piece of filming in Wales {{took place in the}} closed Mir (formerly Alphasteel) steelworks in Newport, which doubled almost <b>unaltered</b> for the Tritovore spaceship. Scenes set in London's Oxford Street were filmed at St Mary Street, Cardiff. Filming took place {{at the peak of the}} February 2009 Great Britain snowfall, where the sub-zero temperatures slowed filming and had a visible effect on the cast. To accommodate for the adverse conditions, Davies included a line in the script that specified that the Tritovore spaceship cooled as external temperatures increase.|$|E
5|$|Finale in {{moderate}} or fast tempo, and in sonata or rondo-sonata form. The {{themes of}} the finales are characterized by long passages of melody accompanied by relentless flowing rhythms. The exposition has no repeat written in. The development section is more ordinary in style {{than that of the}} first movement, with frequent modulations, sequences, and fragmentation of the exposition's first theme (or the main theme of the rondo). The recapitulation closely resembles the exposition, with the minimal harmonic changes needed to end the section in the tonic: the first theme returns in a shortened version; the second theme returns <b>unaltered,</b> only transposed a fourth up. The coda is based on the exposition's first theme. It is composed of two parts, the first quiet and attenuated, creating a sense of expectation, the second animated, dissipating the final tension in decisive, agitated motion and ending with fortissimo tonic chords and octaves.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the last}} glacial period, Indiana's {{topography}} was dominated by spruce and pine forests and was home to mastodon, caribou, and saber-toothed cats. While Northern Indiana had been covered by glaciers, Southern Indiana remained <b>unaltered</b> by the ice's advance, leaving plants and animals that could sustain human communities. Indiana's earliest known inhabitants were Paleo-Indians. Evidence exists that humans were in Indiana as early as the Archaic stage (8000–6000 BC). Hunting camps of the nomadic Clovis culture have been found in Indiana. Carbon dating of artifacts found in the Wyandotte Caves of Southern Indiana shows humans mined flint there as early 2000 BC. These nomads ate quantities of freshwater mussels from local streams, as shown by their shell mounds found throughout southern Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated at the competition's outcome, Leech on June 11, 1891 {{instructed}} Barber {{to prepare}} {{designs for the}} half dollar, quarter, and dime. As the Morgan dollar was then being heavily struck, the Mint director decided to leave that design <b>unaltered</b> for the time being. For the obverse of the new coins, Leech suggested a depiction of Liberty similar to that on the French coins of the period; he was content that the current reverses be continued. Leech had previously suggested to Barber that he engage outside help if the work was {{to be done at}} the Mint; the chief engraver replied that he was aware of no one who could be of help in the preparation of new designs. Leech had spoken with Saint-Gaudens on the same subject; the sculptor stated that only four men in the world were capable of executing high-quality coin designs; three lived in France and he was the fourth.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{was appalled}} when Britain made India {{independent}} in 1947—he {{held that the}} British government had unnecessarily caved in to Indian nationalist demands and should have continued in the subcontinent indefinitely. He retained this view for years afterwards. He retired from the RAF in April 1949 with the rank of wing commander, and the same year emigrated to Southern Rhodesia, a British colony in southern Africa that had been self-governing since 1923. He settled in the central town of Gatooma, where he farmed, mined and set up an earth-moving contractor's business. In 1953, Southern Rhodesia became a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland alongside Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Each territory retained its own political status and government, and Southern Rhodesia's constitutional status was <b>unaltered.</b>|$|E
5|$|In February 1922, {{before the}} Washington Naval Conference concluded, the ship's {{construction}} was suspended {{when she was}} 28 percent complete. She was ordered to be converted to an aircraft carrier with the hull number CV-3 on 1 July 1922. Her displacement was reduced {{by a total of}} , achieved mainly by the elimination of her main armament of eight 16-inch (406mm) guns in four twin gun turrets (including their heavy barbettes, armor, and other equipment). The main armor belt was retained, although it was reduced in height to save weight. The hull generally remained <b>unaltered,</b> as did the torpedo protection system, because they had already been built {{and it would have been}} too expensive to alter them.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} {{clerestory}} {{was added to}} the nave, along with the Perpendicular two-storied south porch; these reconstruction works necessitated the repositioning of the door on the south aisle, and the building of the present-day western wall of the nave, with a great window and door also in the Perpendicular style. Stained glass windows were installed in the clerestory, but their contents were not recorded, and only small fragments of the mediaeval glass survive today: the arms of the Cheyne family, a human figure, and a shield with fragments of coloured glass, possibly the impaled arms of Woburn and Leicester. A staircase in the porch led to a parvise above; local tradition holds that Thomas Harding was held in the parvise prior to his execution in 1532. The porch also contains a stoup dating from the late 14th century, which although much damaged has survived all subsequent restorations and remodellings <b>unaltered.</b>|$|E
5|$|NY52 and NY216 largely swapped {{alignments}} in Spring1937 {{as part of}} {{a larger}} realignment of NY52 through Dutchess and Putnam counties. Route52 was relocated onto NY216 between Stormville and Ludingtonville, from where it followed a new roadway south to Lake Carmel. The former alignment of NY52 between Stormville and Towners became NY216, which was also extended eastward along NY164 to a new eastern terminus at NY22 east of Towners. The alignment of NY216 remained <b>unaltered</b> until January1, 1970, when Route216 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in Poughquag. As part of the truncation, NY216's former alignment from West Pawling to Patterson was renumbered to NY292 while the east–west roadway through Towners became NY164.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September 1926, Shamrock Rovers {{played their}} first game at Glenmalure Park, Milltown against Dundalk, having {{previously}} played at Ringsend Park, Shelbourne Park, Windy Arbour {{and a different}} pitch behind the famous Milltown one. The official opening took place on Sunday, 19 September 1926 as Belfast Celtic provided the opposition in an exhibition game. When the Cunninghams acquired the club in the 1930s, the stadium was named Glenmalure Park in honour of their ancestral home in Glenmalure. They completed the stadium {{with the addition of}} terraces, one of which was covered. The stadium remained essentially <b>unaltered</b> from then until its demolition in 1990, excluding the destruction of a small terrace and the erection of floodlights in the 1980s. Its capacity was approximately 20,000 for most of its existence, its largest recorded attendance being 28,000, set against Waterford in 1968. Larger, unreported, attendances were present at the venue before then.|$|E
