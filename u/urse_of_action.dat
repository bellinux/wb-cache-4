The priory was founded in 1210 by William de Courtenay, grandson <b>of</b> Reginald Fitz <b>Urse</b> (one <b>of</b> the knights who murdered Thomas Becket), perhaps to atone for the past <b>action</b> <b>of</b> his grandfather.|$|R

This dispute was also over land, in this case the misappropriation of bishopric estates by Urse, in his role as Sheriff.|$|R
5|$|The main {{sources for}} Urse's life are English {{documents}} such as charters and writs which mention his activities. Often these {{are contained in}} collections of such documents, known as cartularies, which were assembled by monasteries and cathedral chapters to document their landholdings. Cartularies frequently contain documents from landholders surrounding a monastery, which {{is the case with}} many of the documents mentioning <b>Urse.</b> Other sources <b>of</b> information on <b>Urse</b> are Domesday Book, which mentions his landholdings in 1086, and a number of chronicles, including William of Malmesbury's Gesta pontificum Anglorum, Florence of Worcester's Chronicon ex chronicis, and Hemming's Cartulary, a mixed chronicle and cartulary from Worcester Cathedral.

50|$|Barham Court is the 'big house'. It has {{now been}} {{converted}} into offices and apartments. It was once the home <b>of</b> Randall Fitz <b>Urse,</b> one <b>of</b> the knights who murdered Thomas Becket in 1170. It passed to the de Berham family now called the Barhams, and then the Boteler (or Butler) family. They were Royalists, William Butler was imprisoned for supporting the Kentish Royalist Petition 1642, which indirectly led to the Battle of Maidstone 1648. When Edward Hasted visited in the 18th century, it was owned by the Bouveries. After that it passed to the Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham.|$|R
5|$|The {{lands and}} offices <b>of</b> <b>Urse's</b> brother Robert were divided between Beauchamp and Robert Marmion. Marmion and Beauchamp {{disagreed}} about {{the division of}} the lands, leading to a long dispute between the two families that was only settled in the late 12th century. Some sources state that another daughter <b>of</b> <b>Urse</b> d'Abetot married Robert Marmion, which was the reason for {{the division of the}} lands and offices between the two men. Other sources are less sure, accepting this as one possibility among several for the divided inheritance between the Marmion and Beauchamp families. Because there are no contemporary sources showing that Urse had any children besides his son and the daughter who married Beauchamp, another possibility is that Urse's brother Robert had a daughter who married Marmion, and that Urse managed to acquire part of her inheritance on the strength of his friendship with King William II of England.|$|R
40|$|There {{are certain}} {{signs that the}} works of Marko Marulić enjoyed a limited {{popularity}} and a moderately positive response in Spain in the co <b>urse</b> <b>of</b> the 16 th and 17 th centuries., This particularly refers to his popular moral and theological works like the De institutione, the Evangelistary and the Parables. It has been proved that Marulić was read by the writter and polygraph Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas (1580 - 1645), Saint Francis Xavier (1506 - 1552) and other prominent members of the Society of Jesus. The National Library in Madrid keeps a book catalogued under the title of Evangelistario de Marco Marulo Spalatense (Madrid 1655), which, {{in addition to the}} Spanish translation of the Evangelistary, contains also a translation of the Parables. The same book offers some interesting data that might throw new light on the fortune of Marulić s De institutione in Spain; namely, it is known that in 1612 it was included in the Index of Madrid Inquisition, the officiail list of prohibited and purged books. The same title may be found in the subsequent Spanish editions of the Index. Yet, it still remains unclear whether the ban referring to the Latin original concerned also the obscure Spanish edition of the De istitutione. Evidently, more serious investigations are still to be undertaken; undoubtly, they will provide us with new and substantial evidence concernig the presence of Marulić and his books in the holdings of the Spanish and Hispano-American libraries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the idea of}} an extended unit <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> which is the idea that the reasons for or against an individual action can depend on the qualities of a larger pattern <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> which it is a part.

The aim of this paper is to develop an understanding of Akrasia that enables reconciling it with the Causal Theory <b>of</b> <b>Action.</b> First, the common model <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> the Causal Theory <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> is revised in order to enable understanding <b>of</b> Akratic <b>action.</b> Subsequently, the concept of ‘Desire for Continence’ is developed to explain Akrasia from the perspective of the actor.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> {{activities}} under the conditions of transition and content complexity. The path of the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> was explored through a number of classroom activities in the areas of writing, literature, vocabulary, and grammar. In particular the configuration and the management of the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> were examined to determine what was done by classroom inhabitants to guide and protect the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> activities. The setting of the study was a freshman honors English class in a southwest urban high school. The teacher was identified as an able manager, a factor that was expected to limit the competing vectors that might be triggered by discipline problems. Observations of the class were done over ten weeks or a quarter of the school year. The third period class was observed daily, and a total of forty activities were gathered and analyzed. Data analysis was done over a period of seven months. A quantitative summary of the activities showing activity types and time devoted to each activity type was compiled. The activity summaries were scanned to note emerging patterns. Programs <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> each activity type were mapped to illustrate the configuration and maintenance of the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and the emergence and handling of competing vectors. The final phase of the analysis was the comparison <b>of</b> programs <b>of</b> <b>action</b> across two levels of content complexity. Findings showed that the life of the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in classrooms varied according to activity type. The teacher emerged as the controller <b>of</b> <b>action</b> as illustrated by his choice of content presentation modes and activities. The comparison <b>of</b> programs <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> activities across content complexity showed that students participated more in the maintenance and sustenance of the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in activities in which the content was less complex than they did in activities with more complex content. Furthermore, when the content was more complex, the teacher's control of the maintenance of the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> was more apparent. The length of transition was found to impact negatively the subsequent program <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> On the other hand, lengthy opening activities emerged as contributors to the maintenance <b>of</b> programs <b>of</b> <b>action...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sense {{of agency}} {{refers to the}} feeling of {{controlling}} an external event through one's own action. On one influential view, sense of agency is inferred after an action, by "retrospectively" comparing actual effects <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> against their intended effects. However, it has been recently shown that earlier processes, linked to action selection, may also contribute to sense of agency, in advance <b>of</b> the <b>action</b> itself, and independently <b>of</b> <b>action</b> effects. The inferior parietal cortex (IPC) may underpin this "prospective" contribution to agency, by monitoring signals relating to fluency <b>of</b> <b>action</b> selection in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Here, we combined transcranial stimulation (TMS) with subliminal priming <b>of</b> <b>action</b> selection to investigate the causal role of these regions in the prospective coding of agency. In a first experiment, we showed that TMS over left IPC at the time <b>of</b> <b>action</b> selection disrupts perceived control over subsequent effects <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> In a second experiment, we exploited the temporal specificity of single-pulse TMS to pinpoint the exact timing of IPC contribution to sense of agency.
