5|$|In 1966, Stanford University student Bill Pitts, {{who had a}} hobby of {{exploring}} the steam tunnels and buildings of the campus, broke into a building he found {{out to be the}} location of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project, which held a DEC PDP-6 time-sharing computer system with 20 Teletype consoles connected to it. Fascinated by the computer and having taken several introductory computer classes, Pitts convinced the head of the project, Lester Earnest, to let him <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> after hours. Soon, Pitts had ceased going to classes, instead spending his nights in the computer lab interacting with the graduate and postgraduate students and playing Spacewar on the PDP-6. Pitts often played against Hugh Tuck, a student at California Polytechnic State University who was a friend from high school. During one Spacewar session that took place, depending on the source, between 1966 and 1969, Tuck remarked that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was still unfeasible due to the cost of computers, and the pair did not pursue the project. In 1971, however, Pitts, who by then had graduated and was working at Lockheed as a PDP-10 programmer, learned of the 1970 DEC PDP-11, which was sold for around US$14,000. While this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most electronic games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, Tuck and Pitts felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing.|$|E

Bridger meanwhile, has sold out to an international conglomerate called Intel, represented by the sinister Kaufmann (John Hollis). The British government decides to build the computer at a military establishment at Thorness in Scotland. The computer is switched on and begins to output its first set of instructions.|$|E

If a dispatch office is so busy that its incoming telephone alarm lines are all busy or not answered within 30 seconds, the call is automatically transferred to another borough dispatch office. If an Emergency Reporting System (ERS) street fire alarm box is not answered with 60 seconds, usually because all of the alarm receipt consoles are in <b>use,</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> automatically dispatches an engine company to the location of the physical street fire alarm box.|$|E

A group of students took part in an experiment to design a studio for a graphic designer on <b>the</b> <b>computer.</b> Student attitudes towards the design process were assessed at two conditions: before <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> and after <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer.</b> Prior to <b>the</b> experiment a literature search was carried out to explore some widely researched design issues such as sketching, design creativity, and computer-aided design. Consequently a number of design variables were identified, developed and then empirically tested. Data collection methods included questionnaires and observations. Statistical analysis of the responses confirms that <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> has produced a statistically significant difference in attitudes to the design process variables. ...|$|R
25|$|In the 1980s {{electronic}} typewriters and later personal computers provided people in China and Japan {{an alternative to}} writing by hand. With {{the advent of the}} World Wide Web in 1991 and the subsequent widespread use of email, internet chat, and discussion forums, people began using computers {{to communicate with each other}} in Chinese and Japanese. Today, increased computer usage and the use of SMS text-messaging, especially among young people, means that a large portion of those people's everyday use of Chinese characters is done using input methods, not by hand. In a 2010 survey by Dayang Net, 43 percent of respondents said they <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> all the time for their jobs and 43 percent said that they only write out characters by hand when filling out forms or writing their signature.|$|E
25|$|Network Externality {{positively}} {{affects the}} cultural commons in many ways. The reward for {{being part of}} a group, society, and even the world through a P2P network {{is one of the greatest}} benefits that a modern common-pool resource can provide.The ability to connect and create with people from different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs is something thought to be impossible 100 years ago. Without network externality this form of communication would have been impossible. Through P2P sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums. In Sugata Mitra’s Ted talk, “The child-driven education” he placed a computer in a third world town and left it there to see what would happen. To his amazement children were able to quickly figure out how to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> and educate themselves on its inner workings. This example is a benefit to society for several reasons. The first is the relationship between Sugata Mitra and the P2P network which led him to place the computer in a third world town, along with the ability to present his findings on a public forum. Secondly, it is those who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need a chance to learn and they will take it. This experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those we thought impossible due to the P2P network and network externality that led individuals to the Ted talk.|$|E

2500|$|The OLPC {{project has}} also been criticized for {{allegedly}} adopting a [...] "one-shot" [...] deployment approach {{with little or no}} technical support or teacher training, and for neglecting pilot programs and formal assessment of outcomes in favor of quick deployment. Some authors attribute this unconventional approach to the OLPC promoters' alleged focus on constructivist education and 'digital utopianism'. Mark Warschauer, a Professor of University of California at Irvine and Morgan Ames, at the time of writing, a PhD candidate at Stanford University, have pointed out that the laptop by itself does not completely fill the need of students in underprivileged countries. The [...] "children’s machines", as they have been called, have been deployed to several countries, for example Uruguay, Peru, and in the US, Alabama, but after a relatively short time, their usage has declined considerably, sometimes because of hardware problems or breakage, in some cases, as high as 27% to 59% within the first two years, and sometimes {{due to a lack of}} knowledge on the part of the users on how to take full advantage of the machine. However, another factor has recently been acknowledged; a lack of a direct relation to the pedagogy needed in the local context to be truly effective. Uruguay reports that only 21.5% of teachers use the laptop in the classroom on a daily basis, and 25% report using it less than once a week. In Alabama, 80.3% of students say they never or seldom <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> for class work, and Peru, teachers report that in the first few months, 68.9% use the laptop three times per week, but after two months, only 40% report such usage. Those of a low socio-economic level tend to not be able to effectively use the laptop for educational purposes on their own, but with scaffolding and mentoring from teachers, the machine can become more useful. According to one of the returning OLPC executives, Walter Bender, the approach needs to be more holistic, combining technology with a prolonged community effort, teacher training and local educational efforts and insights.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 25 - 27 and 48 - 52) The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an interactive computer program and study its usefulness in weight loss programs that use behavior modification techniques. This computer program was designed to give quick feedback on the level of goal attainment for target behaviors such as exercise and eating behaviors and response-contingent positive reinforcement. The effectiveness of this computer program as a tool in weight loss programs was evaluated and assessed in order to determine possible applications of such innovative techniques in the future. Ten subjects participated in this study. The subjects were divided randomly into two cohorts, Group A and Group B. The duration of study was eight weeks and a crossover design was used. Group A <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> program for <b>the</b> first four weeks and then group B <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> program for <b>the</b> remaining four weeks of the study.
