40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{the impact of the}} <b>use</b> of <b>computers</b> in science instruction on student attitudes toward learning. Two hundred fourteen sixth graders served as the sample for this study. The subjects were randomly assigned by computer to one of two teams. One team <b>used</b> <b>computers</b> in the instruction of science and the other team did not <b>use</b> <b>computers</b> in the instruction of science. The independent variable was the <b>use</b> of <b>computers</b> in instruction versus not <b>using</b> <b>computers</b> in instruction. The dependent variables were: (a) attitudes toward computers (as measured by the Attitudes Toward Computers Survey), (b) attitudes toward learning processes (as measured by the Attitude Toward Learning Processes Survey), (c) knowledge of science (as measured by the Science Subtest of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills), and (d) attitude toward the <b>use</b> of <b>computers</b> and learning processes (as measured by structured interview questions). The Attitudes Toward Computers Survey and the Attitude Toward Learning Processes Survey were administered at baseline, mid-year, {{and at the end of}} the year. The Science Subtest of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills was administered the end of the year, as were the structured interview questions. ^ Analyses of data revealed that students who were taught in class <b>using</b> <b>computers</b> experienced significantly (p 3 ̆c. 05) more confidence toward computers, less anxiety toward computers, and a more positive attitude toward learning processes compared to students who were taught in class that did not <b>use</b> <b>computers.</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>use</b> did not significantly increase knowledge of subject content.

25|$|Anime {{follows the}} typical {{production}} of animation, including storyboarding, voice acting, character design, and cel production (Shirobako, itself a series, highlights {{many of the}} aspects involved in anime production). Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly <b>used</b> <b>computer</b> animation to improve {{the efficiency of the}} production process. Artists like Noburō Ōfuji pioneered the earliest anime works, which were experimental and consisted of images drawn on blackboards, stop motion animation of paper cutouts, and silhouette animation. Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium. In the 21st century, the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films, including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by Tadahito Mochinaga, Kihachirō Kawamoto and Tomoyasu Murata. Computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990s, with works such as Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke mixing cel animation with computer-generated images. Fuji Film, a major cel production company, announced it would stop cel production, producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes.|$|E
25|$|Sankar Chatterjee {{suggested}} in 2005 that, {{in order for}} Microraptor to glide or fly, the forewings and hindwings must have been on different levels (as on a biplane) and not overlaid (as on a dragonfly), and that the latter posture would have been anatomically impossible. Using this biplane model, Chatterjee was able to calculate possible methods of gliding, and determined that Microraptor most likely employed a phugoid style of gliding: launching itself from a perch, the animal would have swooped downward in a deep U-shaped curve and then lifted again to land on another tree. The feathers not directly employed in the biplane wing structure, like those on the tibia and the tail, {{could have been used}} to control drag and alter the flight path, trajectory, etc. The orientation of the hindwings would also have helped the animal control its gliding flight. Chatterjee also <b>used</b> <b>computer</b> algorithms that test animal flight capacity to test whether or not Microraptor was capable of true, powered flight, as opposed to or in addition to passive gliding. The resulting data showed that Microraptor did have the requirements to sustain level powered flight, so it is theoretically possible that the animal flew as opposed to gliding.|$|E
