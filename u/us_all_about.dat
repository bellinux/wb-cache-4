500|$|The {{species was}} {{named by the}} Unitarian {{minister}} John Lewis Russell of Salem, Massachusetts, based on specimens found in Brattleboro, Vermont. He named the fungus after his friend, fellow amateur American mycologist Charles Christopher Frost, who published {{a description of the}} species in his 1874 survey of the boletes of New England. When the name of a species is contributed by an individual, but the name is formally published by another, the contributor's name can be cited, separated from the publishing author as apud; for this reason, the name and authority are written Boletus Frostii Russell apud Frost in some older literature. Bernard Ogilvie Dodge made reference to B.frostii in 1950 during an address to the Mycological Society of America, in which he spoke {{about the role of the}} amateur in discovering new species: [...] "They would have informed <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the man Russell, who named a fine new bolete for his friend Frost, and about the man Frost, who named a fine new bolete for his friend Russell. Boletus Frostii and Boletus Russellii are mushrooms with character, even though they were described by amateurs." [...] However, in attempting to establish a lectotype specimen, mycologist Roy Halling examined both Russell's original material and his accompanying notes; he concluded that it was Frost who made the original species determinations, further suggesting that [...] "there is no evidence to show that Russell ever collected B.frostii or wrote a description of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|He said “Grenfell {{speaks to}} <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> our own lack of diversity, and {{capacity}} {{to reach into}} the swaths of western society with whom we have no connection. Our own record on diversity is nothing like good enough." [...] The Sutton Trust has stated that just under 80% of top editors were educated at private or grammar schools, compared with 88% of the British public now at comprehensives.|$|E
2500|$|However, not {{everyone}} enjoyed the film. Mark Harris, columnist for Entertainment Weekly, {{described it as}} [...] "fantasy pretending to be social commentary", and accused it of peddling [...] "the delusion that even the bigot next door has something to teach <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> heroism and self-sacrifice", adding [...] "no, he doesn't". Conversely, Nicole Sperling, also of Entertainment Weekly, perceived it in the exact opposite manner. She called it a drama with [...] "the commercial hook of a genre film" [...] and described it further as [...] "a meditation on tolerance wrapped in the disguise of a movie with a gun-toting Clint Eastwood and a cool car". Chi and Robinson said that within the Asian-American community, some criticized [...] "depictions of Hmong men" [...] and [...] "the archetypical white savior trope that permeated the film".|$|E
