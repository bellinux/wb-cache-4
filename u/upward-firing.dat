5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The <b>upward-firing</b> drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
5|$|Following its May 1943 {{debut in}} action, {{during the second}} half of 1943, Schnaufer and his crew began experimenting with <b>upward-firing</b> autocannons, dubbed Schräge Musik. This allowed the night fighter to {{approach}} and attack the bombers from below—outside the enemy crew's usual field of view. An attack by a Schräge Musik-equipped night fighter typically came as a complete surprise to the bomber crew, who realised a night fighter was close by only when they came under fire. It is not exactly known when Schnaufer's Bf 110 was equipped with Schräge Musik. Rumpelhardt stated that the weapons system was installed prior to his return from officer training. It is also not exactly known how many of his victories had been claimed using the upwards firing cannons. According to Fritz Engau, who had known Schnaufer since Flugzeugführerschule C 3, 20 to 30 of Schnaufer's aerial victories had been claimed using upwards firing guns.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable actions of the Bf 110 {{occurred}} {{on the night of}} the 17/18 August 1943. Bf 110 units had been mass equipped with the Schräge Musik system, an emplacement of two <b>upward-firing</b> cannon, which for its initial installations placed the twin-cannon fitment almost midway down the cockpit canopy behind the pilot, which could attack the blind spot of RAF Bomber Command's Lancaster and Halifax bombers, which lacked a ventral turret. Using this, NJG 5's Leutnant Peter Erhardt destroyed four bombers in 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|It was in {{the role}} as a night fighter, often armed with the {{surprisingly}} effective Schräge Musik <b>upward-firing</b> twin autocannon offensive armament installation, that the Bf 110 and its pilots achieved their greatest successes. Luftwaffe night fighter ace Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer was the highest scorer in the Defence of the Reich campaign and ended the war with 121 aerial victories, virtually all of them achieved while flying examples of the Bf 110. Others, such as Helmut Lent, switched to the night fighter arm and built on their modest daylight scores.|$|E

50|$|In World War II, Schräge Musik was {{the name}} Germans gave to <b>upward-firing</b> autocannon that the Luftwaffe mounted in night fighter aircraft. A similar fitment {{was used by the}} Imperial Japanese Army Air Service and Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service and known by a different, undocumented name in their twin-engined night fighters. The Luftwaffe and the IJN air arm had their first {{victories}} with fighter-mounted <b>upward-firing</b> autocannons in May 1943.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{use for the}} AMT driver is as a midrange-tweeter or tweeter in {{high-end}} multi-driver speakers, sometimes paired with horns, {{or in the case}} of Precide's speaker products, with an <b>upward-firing</b> woofer driver.|$|E
5000|$|Early Starfighters used a downward-firing {{ejection}} seat (the Stanley C-1), {{out of concern}} over the ability of an <b>upward-firing</b> seat to clear the [...] "T-tail" [...] empennage. This presented obvious problems in low-altitude escapes, and 21 USAF pilots, including test pilot Capt. Iven Carl Kincheloe Jr., failed to escape from their stricken aircraft in low-level emergencies because of it. The downward-firing seat {{was replaced by the}} Lockheed C-2 <b>upward-firing</b> seat, which was capable of clearing the tail, but still had a minimum speed limitation of 104 mph. Many export Starfighters were later retrofitted with Martin-Baker Mk.7 [...] "zero-zero" [...] (zero altitude and zero airspeed) {{ejection seat}}s.|$|E

5000|$|Oberleutnant Rudolf Schoenert of 4./NJG 2 {{decided to}} {{experiment}} with <b>upward-firing</b> guns in 1941 and began trying out <b>upward-firing</b> installations, amid scepticism from his superiors and fellow pilots. The first installation was made late in 1942, in a Dornier Do 17Z-10 that was also equipped with the early UHF-band version of the FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C radar. In July 1942, Schoenert discussed {{the results of his}} experiment with General Kammhuber, who authorized the conversion of three Dornier Do 217J-1s, to add a vertical armament of four or six MG 151s. Further experiments were carried out by the Luftwaffe flight testing centre [...] at Tarnewitz on the Baltic Sea coast through 1942. An angle between 60° and 75° was found to give best results, allowing a target turning at 8°/sec to be kept in the gunsight.|$|E
5000|$|Many Ju-88C's {{had their}} Bola gondolas {{modified}} {{to hold up}} to two forward firing 20 mm cannon. Several C-6 night fighters were equipped with two [...] "Schräge-Musik" [...] <b>upward-firing</b> 20mm cannon in trial fittings, and from mid 1943 onward, there was an official field modification kit available for this arrangement.|$|E
5000|$|A night fighter version, the P1Y2-S Kyokko (極光, [...] "Aurora"), with Mitsubishi Kasei engines, was {{equipped}} with radar and Schräge Musik-style <b>upward-firing</b> as well as forward-firing 20 mm cannon. A total of 96 were produced by Kawanishi, but due to inadequate high-altitude performance against B-29s, many were converted back to Ginga bombers.|$|E
50|$|Systems {{similar to}} the {{original}} Schräge Musik, such as the Sondergerät 500 or Jägerfaust, were tested on day fighters and other airframes, with the largest-calibre <b>upward-firing</b> aerial ordnance in German service, based on the quintuple-launcher of the 21 cm Nebelwerfer infantry barrage rocket, the experimental heavy-bomber based Grosszerstörer (heavy destroyer) also under test.|$|E
50|$|As {{experimental}} aircraft {{were developed}} as night fighters, {{such as the}} Horten Ho 229, a Schräge Musik system was incorporated from the outset. The experimental Horten Ho 229 flying wing series was proposed for consideration, with a form of unusual <b>upward-firing</b> armament for testing on the V4 night fighter prototype, photoelectric fired vertically mounted rockets or recoilless guns, instead of cannon armament inspired by the Jagdfaust.|$|E
50|$|Overall the N-1 was {{an initial}} {{production}} of the J-1 version. Powered by a DB 603 it had similar armament to Do 217 J-2, retaining defensive armament. Entered service in April 1943. Some modified with dorsal and ventral guns replaced by wooden fairings as Do 217 N-1/U1, conversion with Schräge Musik arrangement of four <b>upward-firing</b> 20 mm MG 151s as Do 217 N-1/U3. About 240 built.|$|E
50|$|While suited {{very well}} for high frequencies, the AMT can {{reproduce}} sound down to 400 Hz and research is continuing to extend the range towards bass frequencies. Consequently, the most common use for the AMT driver in consumer electronics today is as a midrange-tweeter or tweeter in high-end multi-driver speakers, sometimes paired with horns, {{or in the case}} of Precide's speaker products, with an <b>upward-firing</b> woofer driver.|$|E
5000|$|Crew {{provision}} {{was for a}} pilot under a [...] "fighter"-type bubble canopy and a Short-range navigation and bombing system (SHORAN) operator/navigator in a compartment located lower than and {{to the rear of}} the cockpit (only a small observation window was provided). Both crew members were provided with a pressurized, air conditioned environment, equipped with <b>upward-firing</b> ejection seats. The XB-51 was the first Martin aircraft equipped with ejection seats, these being of their own design.|$|E
5000|$|Ki-109: Night fighter prototypes.

Only a project.|$|E
50|$|Schoenert is {{recognised}} as the instigator of <b>upward-firing</b> armament in German night fighter aircraft, {{which he}} introduced {{into his own}} Dornier Do-17 in 1942. The concept, dubbed Schräge Musik (Jazz Music), was initially rejected by Helmut Lent and Werner Streib. Oberfeldwebel Paul Mahle, an armourer attached to II./Nachtjagdgeschwader 5 (NJG 5—5th Night Fighter Wing) at Parchim, worked closely with Rudolf Schoenert and built his own working prototype of Schräge Musik, which was soon fitted {{to all of the}} Gruppe's aircraft.|$|E
50|$|A {{heavily armed}} variant, {{developed}} from the Me 262, of which two versions were foreseen: Version A would be armed with a MK 108 cannon and a MK 112 55 mm cannon. Version B was armed with a MK 114 50 mm cannon. The radio equipment would be a FuG 16, Peil G6, FuG 101 radio altimeter, FuBl 2 blind landing equipment, {{as well as the}} FuG 25a Erstling identification friend or foe transceiver.There was also a night fighter version equipped with two <b>upward-firing</b> MK 108 cannons.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, F-104C Starfighers (and an F-104D two-seat trainer) were {{assigned}} to the 156th, upgrading the group to Mach-2 supersonic tactical fighter-bombers, replacing the elderly F-86H Sabre fighter-bombers. The F-104C was equipped to carry bombs or rocket pods on under-wing and fuselage points. The <b>upward-firing</b> Lockheed C-2 rocket-boosted ejector seat was standard. The internal 20-mm rotary cannon of the F-104A was retained, as well as the ability to carry an AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile on each wingtip to fill an air defense interceptor mission.|$|E

The <b>upward-firing</b> drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
50|$|Aft of the CPA 1's semi-cylindrical nose {{there was}} a cabin about 5 m long for the observer. It had a forward facing window and a frame that could hold forty 10 kg or ten 50 kg bombs, {{deployed}} through ventral openings. It also had an open gun position in the nose and was equipped for vertical and oblique photography. The pilot's cockpit was under the wing trailing edge with a rear-gunner's position close behind, equipped with demountable dual controls, <b>upward-firing</b> machine guns on a flexible mount and a ventral hatch for another gun-mounting covering the lower rear field of fire.|$|E
50|$|The crew {{consisted}} of seven airmen: pilot, navigator, gunner, plus four additional crew members who sat inside a pressurized compartment that replaced the camera/bomb bay. The basic three crew {{members in the}} front used <b>upward-firing</b> ejector seats, whereas the four additional ECM operators used downward-firing ejector seats. An extensive suite of specialized equipment was fitted to locate and identify enemy radar emissions. Additional ECM equipment was carried in wingtip pods. Chaff dispensing pods could be carried underneath the wing outboard of the engine nacelles. Later examples had the tail turret removed and replaced by additional ECM equipment installed in an extended tailcone.|$|E
5000|$|All {{crew members}} sit on forward-facing, <b>upward-firing</b> Douglas Escapac zero-zero {{ejection}} seats. In [...] "group eject" [...] mode, initiating ejection from either front seat ejects the entire crew in sequence, {{with the back}} seats ejecting 0.5 seconds before the front {{in order to provide}} safe separation. The rear seats are capable of self ejection, and the ejection sequence includes a pyrotechnic charge that stows the rear keyboard trays out of the occupants' way immediately before ejection. Safe ejection requires the seats to be weighted in pairs, and when flying with a single crewman in the back the unoccupied seat is fitted with ballast blocks.|$|E

50|$|While turret fighters {{like the}} Boulton Paul Defiant and the naval Blackburn Roc {{addressed}} the same threat - enemy bombers attacking the UK - the approach was very different: <b>upward-firing</b> guns and no-allowance shooting are separate and distinct, {{the equipment that}} can do the one can, generally speaking, be arranged so as to do the other (unless the fixed armament is automatically triggered, as in the photo-cell firing arrangements detailed below). On paper at least, the advantages of flexible aim and weight of fire from a two-seater were clear: the pilot is not overburdened, several fighters could {{be brought to bear}} on a target together and there are two pairs of eyes per aircraft. However, the weight of a powered turret and air gunner imposed their own severe and often fatal penalties.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effective}} Schräge Musik [...] offensive armament fitment was the German name {{given to}} installations of <b>upward-firing</b> autocannon mounted in large, twin-engine night fighters by the Luftwaffe and Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service during World War II, {{with the first}} victories for each occurring in May 1943. This innovation allowed the night fighters to approach and attack bombers from below, {{where they would be}} outside the bomber crew's field of view. Few bombers of that era carried defensive guns in the ventral position. An attack by a Schräge Musik-equipped fighter was typically a complete surprise to the bomber crew, who would only realize that a fighter was close by when they came under fire. Particularly in the initial stage of operational use until early 1944, the sudden fire from below was often attributed to ground fire rather than a fighter.|$|E
5000|$|Nor was the B.E.12 [...] "rushed" [...] {{into service}} as {{would have been}} {{relatively}} easy {{as it was a}} straightforward conversion of a type in production. Trials with the prototype continued through late 1915 and seem to have been mainly concerned with the development of the new RAF 4 engine, especially the design of a satisfactory air scoop. Cooling of the rear cylinders of the RAF 4, an air-cooled V12 and later the engine of the R.E.8, was always rather dubious. The type was also tested as a bomber. It was May 1916 (when the [...] "Fokker scourge", as a period of German air superiority was over) that it was decided to fit a synchronised Vickers gun to the type, armament trials had already been undertaken with <b>upward-firing</b> Lewis guns, similar to those used by the night fighter version of the B.E.2c.|$|E
50|$|Air Ministry Specification F.9/37 {{led to the}} second, Rolls Royce Peregrine powered, {{prototype}} of the Gloster G39 having a +12°, no-allowance armament of three <b>upward-firing</b> dorsal 20mm cannon in the fuselage and two in the nose. While it was a promising aircraft in its own right, {{by the time that}} the second prototype was completed the conventionally-armed Bristol Beaufighter was already in production, so neither the G39 nor the subsequent Gloster Reaper were pursued. Similar logic lay behind Air Ministry specification F11/37, which specified a turret-mounted cannon armament: of three companies who tendered (Armstrong Whitworth and Bristol) had turrets that could only traverse through the forward hemisphere, as did Air Ministry specification F22/39, written around the Vickers Type 414 twin-engined fighter, which combined a streamlined monoplane two-seater fighter airframe with a remotely controlled 40mm cannon in the nose that could be elevated for no-allowance shooting.|$|E

50|$|The first planned version {{to reach}} {{production}} was the He 219 A-2 model, which had longer engine nacelles containing extra fuel tanks, unitized 1670 PS DB 603AA engines with higher critical altitude and often also two 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannon, as an offensive Schräge Musik <b>upward-firing</b> {{system in the}} rear fuselage. With Schräge Musik, the ventral weapons bay held two cannon due to space limitations. The A-2 featured an updated, 90 MHz VHF-band Telefunken FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 radar system, complete with its larger, high-drag 4 × 2-dipole element Hirschgeweih aerials. It initially had a longer minimum range than the C-1 radar, but had improved accuracy and resolution and was also less vulnerable to chaff jamming, through the late summer of 1944. A total of 85 He 219 A-2s were built until November 1944, most at EHR (Ernst Heinkel Rostock) or Heinkel-Nord in Rostock-Marienehe (now Rostock-Schmarl).|$|E
