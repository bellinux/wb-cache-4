When the Folkston–Kingsland {{stretch of}} SR40 reappeared on maps in February 1932, the highway was {{recorded}} as an unimproved but maintained road. SR40 was <b>under</b> <b>construction</b> along its present alignment from US17 in Kingsland {{to the south}} end of Osborne Street in St. Marys by October 1934; the highway was completed as a paved road by January 1936. The highway from Folkston to the Charlton–Camden county line was <b>under</b> <b>construction</b> by October 1936. The construction was extended east from the county line to the highway's original SR110 junction in July 1937. When construction concluded in October 1937, there was a paved highway from Folkston to the county line and a graded but otherwise unimproved highway from there to SR110. SR40 between Colerain and the western edge of Kingsland was <b>under</b> <b>construction</b> by July 1939 and paving was completed in January 1941.
