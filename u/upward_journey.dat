60|$|Hopping up ladders, {{and across}} planks, and on {{elevated}} perches, until I was uncertain whether to liken {{myself to a}} bird or a brick- layer, I became conscious of standing on nothing particular, looking down into {{one of a series}} of large cocklofts, with the outer day peeping in through the chinks in the tiled roof above. A number of women were ascending to, and descending from, this cockloft, each carrying on the <b>upward</b> <b>journey</b> a pot of prepared lead and acid, for deposition under the smoking tan. When one layer of pots was completely filled, it was carefully covered in with planks, and those were carefully covered with tan again, and then another layer of pots was begun above; sufficient means of ventilation being preserved through wooden tubes. Going down into the cockloft then filling, I found the heat of the tan to be surprisingly great, and also the odour of the lead and acid to be not absolutely exquisite, though I believe not noxious at that stage. In other cocklofts, where the pots were being exhumed, the heat of the steaming tan was much greater, and the smell was penetrating and peculiar. There were cocklofts in all stages; full and empty, half filled and half emptied; strong, active women were clambering about them busily; and the whole thing had rather the air of the upper part of the house of some immensely rich old Turk, whose faithful seraglio were hiding his money because the sultan or the pasha was coming.|$|E
6000|$|Every one is {{familiar}} with the story of its discovery. For many years the bay of San Francisco had been famed for the luscious quality of its oysters. It is stated that a dredger one day raked up a large bell, which proved to belong to the City Hall, and led to the discovery of the cupola of that building. The attention of the government was at once directed to the spot. The bay of San Francisco was speedily drained by a system of patent siphons, and the city, deeply embedded in mud, brought to light after a burial of many centuries. The City Hall, Post-Office, Mint, and Custom-House were readily recognized by the large full-fed barnacles which adhered to their walls. Shortly afterwards the first skeleton was discovered; that of a broker, whose position in the upper strata of mud nearer the surface was supposed to be owing to the exceeding buoyancy or inflation of scrip which he had secured about his person while endeavoring to escape. Many skeletons, supposed to be those of females, encompassed in that peculiar steel coop or cage which seems to have been worn by the women of that period, were also found in the upper stratum. Alexis von Puffer, in his admirable work on San Francisco, accounts for the position of these unfortunate creatures by asserting that the steel cage was originally the frame of a parachute-like garment which distended the skirt, and in the submersion of the city prevented them from sinking. [...] "If anything," [...] says Von Puffer, [...] "could have been wanting to add intensity to the horrible catastrophe which took place as the waters first entered the city, it would have been furnished in the forcible separation of the sexes at this trying moment. Buoyed up by their peculiar garments, the female population instantly ascended to the surface. As the drowning husband turned his eyes above, what must have been his agony as he saw his wife shooting upward, and knew that he was debarred the privilege of perishing with her? To the lasting honor of the male inhabitants, be it said that but few seemed to have availed themselves of their wives' superior levity.

[...] "It was the best coached team we saw this year," [...] said the Minnesota newspapermen.

After {{more than half a}} century, the charge of Pickett's men at Gettysburg was re-enacted. The same matchless courage which guided the ragged Rebel band up those shell-ton heights, led the Commodores to conquest.It was the first victory of a Vanderbilt eleven ever attained across the line which divorces Dixie from the North. Mirrored here on Yankee sod today was that unconquerable spirit which enabled forefathers of the Commodores back in '63 to jest through a tempest of musketry and canister and grape.Vanderbilt won because its play reflected all the legends, all the chivalry, all the courage of Southern history. Because its spirit never for a second faltered. Because it grinned at frowning barriers and went through. Because its valor could not be scorned by the flame of that attack which burned Illinois to a crisp a week ago.

Fred McKibbon left Minneapolis dizzy with his crafty timing of aerial shots.All restraint fled yesterday afternoon as a telegraph wire flashed to Vanderbilt Stadium the news that a Commodore team had won its most glorious victory of a decade. Man became monkey. He sprang into the air, and wrapped his prehensile tail around an imaginary coconut tree, and tried to scream the stars into alarm.Vanderbilt, the under-favored, became Commodore the triumph, the king of all sons, charted or uncharted.

Swenztell’s Despairing Clown figure is a comment on the loss of one’s identity. The sculpture itself is a clown who looks down sadly as he peels off his stripes and seeks to convey the struggle of finding oneself again. Emergence of the Clowns (1989), symbolizes the surfacing of the Pueblo people into this world. Three of the figures in Emergence are partial human forms which progressively lead to concluding figure who is complete. Each partial form is meant to capture the emotion of amazement, knowledge, and awe. The stages of ascendancy in Emergence, shown in each figure’s development, further accentuates the Pueblo’s collective <b>journey</b> <b>upward.</b>|$|R
40|$|Optical {{images of}} astronomical objects viewed through {{ground-based}} telescopes are blurred by the atmosphere. The atmosphere is turbulent {{and as a}} consequence the density of air is not evenly distributed. This results in random, time-varying variations in refractive index. The wave-fronts passing through the atmosphere become aberrated, degrading the quality of the images. One solution is to include an adaptive optics system in the telescope. The system estimates the aberration of the wave-fronts and compensates the wave-front in real time using a corrector element, typically a deformable mirror. An important problem is how to estimate the aberrations optimally using only a small amount of light. This procedure is called wave-front sensing and is the subject of the research of this thesis. For turbulence with Kolmogorov statistics, the wave-front slope contains 87 % of the energy of the aberrations. Hence, it is crucial to estimate the slope accurately. The displacement of an image is directly proportional to the wave-front slope and is used to estimate the slope. The conventional way of measuring the average slope of the wave-front in a Shack-Hartmann sensor is from the centroid of the image at the focal plane. It is demonstrated that using the centroid estimator produces an estimate with infinite variance. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is a theoretical lower bound for the variance of an unbiased estimator. The variance of the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate for the displacement of a diffraction-limited image approaches the CRLB using {{a relatively small number of}} photons. The ML estimator is extended to the case where the image is randomly blurred by atmospheric turbulence. It is found that the variance of the error of the slope estimator can be improved significantly at low turbulence levels by using the ML estimator instead of the centroid. Curvature sensors use two defocused images to estimate the wave-front aberrations. It is shown using the CRLB that the focal plane is the optimal plane to measure the slope and the error using defocused images is quantified. The effect of using broadband light on the accuracy of the slope estimate is also investigated. When using laser guide stars, it is not possible to estimate the slope of the wave-front directly from the image because the beam is displaced on both the <b>upward</b> and downward <b>journey.</b> However, the displacement is a weak function of wavelength due to dispersion. In theory, the difference in wave-front slope as a function of wavelength is proportional to the absolute slope. Centering algorithms were implemented on experimental data taken at the Observatoire de Lyon to confirm this relationship. There is strong evidence pointing to a linear relationship between two pairs of differential tilt measurements, but not between the differential and the absolute tilt. However, the data appears to have been affected by a systematic experimental error and a new experiment is needed. Phase retrieval is a non-linear technique used to recover the phase in the Fourier domain using intensity measurements at the image plane and additional constraints. A method is described to solve the phase retrieval problem using linear iterations near the solution, which provides both analytical insight into phase retrieval and numerical results. The algorithm finds the maximum a posteriori estimate of the phase using prior information about the statistics of the noise and the phase and converges well in practice. When phase retrieval is performed on data from subdivided apertures, there is a loss of information regarding the relative piston terms of the subapertures and this error is quantified. It is found that there is a smaller wavefront error when estimating the phase from a full aperture than from a subdivided aperture. Using a combination of intensity measurements from a full and a subdivided aperture is shown to result in a small improvement at very high photon levels only. Curvature sensors measure the wave-front aberrations via a linear relationship between the curvature of the wave-front and the intensity difference between two defocused images. In practice, their performance is limited by their non-linear behaviour, which is characterised by solving simultaneously the irradiance transport equation and the accompanying wave-front transport equation. It is shown how the presence of non-linear geometric terms limits the accuracy of the sensor and how diffraction effects limit the spatial resolution. The effect of photon noise on the sensor is also quantified. A novel technique for deriving wave-front aberrations from two defocused intensity measurements is derived. The intensity defines a probability density function and the method is based on the evolution of the cumulative density function of the intensity. In one dimension, the problem is easily solved using histogram specification with a linear relationship between the wave-front slope and the difference in the abscissas of the histograms. This method is insensitive to scintillation. In two dimensions, the procedure requires the use of the Radon transform. Simulation results demonstrate that very good reconstructions can be attained down to 100 photons in each detector...|$|R

By seeing the intensity of the battle, Lord Shiva assumed the form of a flaming Linga in between Brahma and Vishnu and challenged both of them by asking them to measure the gigantic Linga (phallic symbol of Lord Shiva).The place where lord Shiva manifested is Arunachala refers to the holy hill at Thiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu. The hill is also known by the names Arunagiri, Annamalai Hill, Arunachalam, Arunai, Sonagiri and Sonachalam.Awestruck by its magnitude, Brahma and Vishnu decided to find one end each to establish supremacy over the other. Lord Brahma took the form of a swan and went upwards while Lord Vishnu assumed the form of Varaha - a boar and went into the earth towards nether land. Both searched for thousands of miles but neither could find the end. On his <b>journey</b> <b>upward,</b> Brahma came across Ketaki flower. Exhausted and bewildered with his search to find the uppermost limit of fiery column, Brahma made Ketaki assent to lie that he had seen the top of the column where the flower had previously resided. Accompanied by his accomplice, Brahma confronted Vishnu and asserted that he had indeed discovered the origin of the cosmic column. At this point, {{the central part of the}} pillar split open and SadhaShiva revealed himself in his full glory. The night SadhaShiva revealed himself is celebrated as Shivaratri or Satya Ratri or Gyana Ratri on the Shivaratri Night. Overawed, both Brahma and Vishnu bowed before him accepted lord Shiva’s supremacy. Lord Sadha Shiva also explained to Brahma and Vishnu that both of them as well Rudra and Maheshwara were born out of lord Shiva and all the five were then separated out into Five different aspects of divinity. This day is regarded as Satya ratri or gyana ratri because Brahma and Vishnu lost their ego and found supreme almighty god is Sat Chit AnandaHowever, Lord Sadha Shiva was angry with Brahma for making a false claim. The Lord cursed Brahma that no one would ever pray to him. (This legend explains why there is hardly any Brahma temple of significance in India.) Lord Shiva also punished the Ketaki flower for testifying falsely and banned her from being used as an offering for any worship.While Lord Vishnu realized the mistake for it so vishnu got the boon that he will be equally beautiful as me (Shiva) but he too felt Ahamkaram as supreme (ego) so he did not supreme fame while Shankara or Rudra and Maheswara didn't felt ego or Ahamkaram So Lord Shiva gave them boon that there fame and power will be equal to mine.They both will praised as equal as me.Since it was on the 14th day in the dark fortnight of the month of Phalguna that Shiva first manifested himself in the form of a Linga, the day is extremely auspicious and is celebrated as Mahashivaratri - the grand night of Shiva. To celebrate the occasion, devotees of Lord Shiva fast during the day and pray to the Lord throughout the night. It is said that worshipping of Lord Shiva on Shivaratri bestows one with happiness and prosperity.Unlike most Hindu festivals which are celebrated during the day, Maha Shivaratri is celebrated at night. The celebration includes maintaining a [...] "jaagaran", an all-night vigil and prayers, because Shaiva Hindus mark this night as [...] "overcoming darkness and ignorance" [...] in one's life and the world through Shiva. Offerings of fruits, leaves, sweets and milk to Shiva are made, some perform all-day fasting with vedic or tantrik worship of Shiva, and some perform meditative Yoga.4In Shiva temples, [...] "Om Namah Shivaya", the sacred mantra of Shiva, is chanted through the day.The legend of marriage of Shankara and Parvati is one the most important legends related to the festival of Mahashivaratri. The story tells us how Lord Shankara got married to Parvati, his divine consort. According to legend of Shankara and Shakti, the day Lord Shankara got married to Parvati is celebrated as Shivaratri - the Night of Lord Shiva.Maha Shivaratri is celebrated over three or ten days based on the Hindu luni-solar calendar.2Every lunar month, there is a Shivaratri (12 per year). The main festival is called Maha Shivaratri, or great Shivaratri, and this is on 13th night (waning moon) and 14th day of the month Phalguna (Magha). According to the Gregorian calendar, the day falls in either February or March ...|$|R
40|$|In the Karakoram Ridge of NW India, the Tangtse gorge {{cuts across}} deep crustal rocks exhumed by transpression along two strands of the dextral Karakoram fault. Crustal leucogranitic magmas prevasively intruded amphibolites and migmatites {{in the form}} of sheets that locally {{coalesced}} and expanded to form kilometre-scale plutons. Sheets resulted from slop seeping of granite into folidation planes (magmas wedging) rather than from dyking, driven by magmas buoyancy and possible syn-intrusive tectonic deformation. High temperature of the country rocks at the time of intrusion is inferred from similar crystallization ages of the intrusive leucogranite and in situ partial melt in the migmatites, and reflected in the ductile structures developed. Whereas low country rock viscosity inhibited dyking, high temperature freed the magmas from the constraints of freezing and permitted pervasive intrusion. The injection complex exposed along the Tangtse gorge, rather than representing the final emplacement structures, represent transient structures of the granite pathways on their <b>upward</b> <b>journey</b> tobuild the Karakoram batholith, which crops out a few kilometres north, at structurally shallower levels. We suggest that pervasive magmas flow is a transitional step between magma segregation at the source and later rise through cold crust and it may be one of several factors controlling whether dyking or diapirism becomes dominant during late ascent...|$|E
40|$|The Sun {{operates}} {{like a giant}} plasma diffuser that sorts lighter isotopes {{and elements}} to the solar surface. Measurements indicate that {{the interior of the}} Sun consists mostly of the same seven, even-numbered elements as ordinary meteorites: Iron, oxygen, nickel, silicon, sulfur, magnesium, and calcium. These ordinary elements compose clothing on the central neutron star that was produced {{at the core of the}} supernova that exploded here 5 billion years ago. Neutron emission generates most solar energy. Neutron-decay near the core produces Hydrogen ions that are accelerated upward by deep-seated magnetic fields. This is the carrier gas that maintains mass separation in the Sun. Like smoke, Hydrogen is a by-product from the solar furnace that powers the Sun. As smoke passes over catalytic converters in the flue of a high-efficiency furnace, most Hydrogen is fused into Helium during its <b>upward</b> <b>journey.</b> H-fusion makes less than 38 percent of solar energy. Each year 50 trillion tons of Hydrogen reach the solar surface and are flung off in the solar wind, with isotopes of other trace elements carefully sorted by mass. Hydrogen is smoke from the solar furnace, rather than its primary fuel. Comment: 5 page layman summary of research, with hyper-links to measurements that unmasked the Iron Su...|$|E
