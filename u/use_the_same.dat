5|$|All these {{distributions}} have no or {{only minor}} changes {{when compared with}} the original FreeBSD base system. The main difference to the original FreeBSD is that they come with pre-installed and pre-configured software for specific use cases. This can be compared with Linux distributions, which are all binary compatible because they <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> kernel and also <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> basic tools, compilers and libraries, while coming with different applications, configurations and branding.|$|E
5|$|The A and B {{clarinets}} {{have nearly}} the same bore and <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mouthpiece. Orchestral clarinetists using the A and B instruments in a concert could <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) (see 'usage' below). The A and B have nearly identical tonal quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. The tone of the E clarinet is brighter and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures. The bass clarinet has a characteristically deep, mellow sound, while the alto clarinet is similar in tone to the bass (though not as dark).|$|E
5|$|The same {{material}} also functions in newer alkaline batteries (usually battery cells), which <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> basic reaction, but a different electrolyte mixture. In 2002, more than 230,000tons of manganese dioxide {{was used for}} this purpose.|$|E

5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration {{can be very}} detailed in the geographic divisions laid down. It may, for example, allow one party to own {{the right to use}} a mark within a fifty-mile radius around a handful of selected cities or counties, while the other party owns the right to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mark everywhere else in the country. It may even divide the rights to use a mark within a particular city by reference to roads or other landmarks in that city.|$|E
5|$|Acting {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, he tended to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots to emphasize the play of emotions on the faces of his characters.|$|E

5|$|Prokaryotes {{control their}} use of these {{electron}} donors and acceptors by varying which enzymes are produced, in response to environmental conditions. This flexibility is possible because different oxidases and reductases <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> ubiquinone pool. This allows many combinations of enzymes to function together, linked by the common ubiquinol intermediate. These respiratory chains therefore have a modular design, with easily interchangeable sets of enzyme systems.|$|E
