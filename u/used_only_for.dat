5|$|There {{was also}} {{significant}} condescension towards COBOL {{in the business}} community from users of other languages, for example FORTRAN or assembler, implying that COBOL could be <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> non-challenging problems.|$|E
5|$|A {{small wooden}} {{platform}} was built at Hellingly railway station, opposite {{the main line}} platform. This had no connection to the station buildings and was <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> the transfer of passengers between main-line and hospital trains, and kept chained off when not in use. Coal yards and sidings were also built at Hellingly station. The hospital opened to patients, and the railway to passengers, on 20 July 1903.|$|E

5|$|After the Roman {{conquest of}} Britain in the 1st centuryAD, Maiden Castle {{appears to have}} been abandoned, {{although}} the Romans may have had a military presence on the site. In the late 4th centuryAD, a temple and ancillary buildings were constructed. In the 6th centuryAD the hill top was entirely abandoned and was <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> agriculture during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|Most {{promethium}} is <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> research purposes, {{except for}} promethium-147, {{which can be}} found outside laboratories. It is obtained as the oxide or chloride, in milligram quantities. This isotope does not emit gamma rays, and its radiation has a relatively small penetration depth in matter and a relatively long half-life.|$|E

5000|$|Swifts {{have very}} short legs which they <b>use</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> {{clinging}} to vertical surfaces. The scientific name Apodidae {{comes from the}} Ancient Greek απους, apous, meaning [...] "without feet". They never settle voluntarily on the ground.|$|R
5|$|The Inner Court is {{separated}} from the Outer Court by an oblong courtyard lying orthogonal to the City's main axis. It was {{the home of the}} Emperor and his family. In the Qing dynasty, the Emperor lived and worked almost exclusively in the Inner Court, with the Outer Court <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> ceremonial purposes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} tournament in 1920, {{there were many}} {{differences}} from the modern game: games were played outdoors on natural ice, forward passes were not allowed, the rink (which had been intended to be <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> figure skating) was 56m×18m (165ft×58.5ft) and two 20-minute periods were played. Each team had seven players on the ice, the extra position being the rover. Following the tournament, the IIHF held a congress and decided to adopt the Canadian rules—six men per side and three periods of play.|$|E
5|$|El Toro {{has several}} {{similarities}} to Viper, the coaster that it replaced. The most obvious similarity is that El Toro uses Viper's station, {{the only part}} of Viper that was not torn down. The station previously held two Viper trains at once, with a loading platform in the front and an unloading platform in the rear. The ramp that was previously Viper's main exit is now <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> wheelchair access, as El Toro has a new exit {{on the other side of}} the station. During El Toro's construction, the station was gutted and an entirely new platform built. Like El Toro, Viper turned left out of the station before the lift hill and turned left at the top of the lift before the first drop.|$|E
50|$|Sexes are similar, {{and young}} birds differ from adults mainly in their shorter tails. Asian palm swift has very short legs which it <b>uses</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> {{clinging}} to vertical surfaces, since swifts never settle voluntarily on the ground.|$|R

5|$|In August, Paramount, {{with the}} help of other stockholders, seized full control of DuMont Laboratories. The last non-sports program on DuMont, the game show What's the Story, aired on September 23, 1955. After that, DuMont's network feed was <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> {{occasional}} sporting events. DuMont's last broadcast, a boxing match, aired on August 6, 1956. The date has also been reported as April 1950, September 1955, or August 4, 1958. According to one source, the final program aired on only five stations nationwide. It appears that the boxing show was syndicated to a few other east coast stations until 1958, but likely not as a production of DuMont or its successor company.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to jwé and other music performed for entertainment, Saint Lucia {{is also home}} to styles <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> specific occasions. These include work songs, drinking songs, funereal music and serenades and masquerades. The latter two traditions are nearly extinct in modern Saint Lucia. The masquerade was a celebration held near holidays like Easter and New Year's Day, which included an orchestra consisting of a tanbou tenbal, chakchak and a bamboo flute. This same ensemble also traditionally performs for cockfights, merry-go-rounds and vocal serenades, called séwinal in Lucian Creole.|$|E
5|$|Luke's face {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be a van der Weyden self-portrait. He may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint and with the founder of painting. This is reinforced by the fact that Luke is shown drawing in silverpoint on white paper; an extremely difficult medium that demands high concentration, and is normally <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> preparation. The artist is boldly emphasising his ability and skill with preparatory sketches; a single surviving silverpoint drawing attributed to van der Weyden, now in the Louvre, contains a female head very similar to Mary's in the Boston panel.|$|E

5|$|Paris {{is a major}} {{international}} air transport hub with the 5th busiest airport system in the world. The city is served by three commercial international airports: Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Paris-Orly and Beauvais-Tillé. Together these three airports recorded traffic of 96.5 million passengers in 2014. There is also one general aviation airport, Paris-Le Bourget, historically the oldest Parisian airport and closest to the city centre, which is now <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> private business flights and air shows.|$|E
5|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have argued}} that Nahuatl displays the properties of a non-configurational language, meaning that word order in Nahuatl is basically free. Nahuatl allows all possible orderings of the three basic sentence constituents. It is prolifically a pro-drop language: it allows sentences with omission of all noun phrases or independent pronouns, not just of noun phrases or pronouns whose function is the sentence subject. In most varieties independent pronouns are <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> emphasis. It allows certain kinds of syntactically discontinuous expressions.|$|E
5|$|The MBTA Commuter Rail is the {{commuter}} rail {{system for the}} Greater Boston metropolitan area of Massachusetts. It {{is owned by the}} Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and operated under contract by the Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad Company (MBCR). As of the first quarter of 2013, it was the sixth-busiest commuter rail system in the United States with an average weekday ridership of 127,500. There are currently 138 stations on 12 lines, with one additional station <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> special events at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough.|$|E
50|$|Swifts {{have very}} short legs that they <b>use</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> {{clinging}} to vertical surfaces. They never settle voluntarily on the ground, and {{spend most of}} their lives in the air, feeding on insects that they catch in their beaks. They drink on the wing.|$|R

5|$|The Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya, which {{contains}} {{the tomb of}} Amir Taybars, was built in 1309. Originally intended {{to function as a}} complementary mosque to al-Azhar it has since been integrated {{with the rest of the}} mosque. The Maliki and Shāfi‘ī madh'hab were studied in this madrasa, though it now is used to hold manuscripts from the library. The only surviving piece from the original is the qibla wall and its polychrome mihrab. Al-Maqrizi reported that the madrasa was <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> studying the Shāfi‘ī while the historian Ibn Duqmaq reported that one of the liwans in the madrasa was reserved for Shāfi‘ī teachings while the other was for Maliki teachings.|$|E
5|$|The Sovereign has {{historically}} {{had the power}} to choose Knights of the Order. From the eighteenth century onwards, the Sovereign made his or her choices upon the advice of the Government. George VI felt that the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle had been <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> political patronage, rather than to reward actual merit. Therefore, with the agreement of the Prime Minister (Clement Attlee) and the Leader of the Opposition (Winston Churchill) in 1946, both Orders returned to the personal gift of the Sovereign.|$|E
5|$|The Sweet Track was <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> {{about ten}} years; rising water levels may have engulfed it, and {{therefore}} curtailed its use. The variety of objects found alongside the track {{suggest that it}} was in daily use as part of the farming life of the community. Since its discovery, it has been determined that parts of the Sweet Track were built along the route of an even earlier track, the Post Track, which was constructed thirty years earlier in 3838 BC.|$|E
