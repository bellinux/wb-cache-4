A similar event occurred on May  2005 and on September  2009. As a result, the National Civil Protection Department (DPC) started an accurate monitoring and analysis program. A monitoring project using the GB-InSAR (ground-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar) system was emplaced to investigate the landslide kinematics, plan <b>urgent</b> <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> for risk mitigation and design long-term stabilization work. Here, we present the GB-InSAR monitoring system results and its applications in the observational method (OM) approach. GB-InSAR is an established instrument for long-term campaigns aimed at early warning and monitoring during construction works. Our paper further develops these aspects in that it highlights how the OM based on the GB-InSAR technique can produce savings in terms of cost and time in engineering projects without compromising safety.

On its own or in collaboration with other organizations, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been launching several challenges and guidelines meant to provide inputs for discussions about local circumstances and especially for healthcare institutions to have a starting point to implement and foster imperative, <b>urgent</b> <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> The topic is not new. Much to the contrary, it is as old as healthcare itself. However, the importance of healthcare and the high risks associated to it began being acknowledged after the 1999 publication of the US Institute of Medicine report, To Err is Human(1). Last April in Brazil, the Ministry of Health instituted the National Patient Safety Program in response to individual and/or collective entreaties by healthcare professionals and the population at large for safe healthcare free of incidents that may compromise people’s health. In nursing, educators, care providers, researchers and undergraduate and graduate students have been voluntarily rallying since 2008 to create and develop the Brazilian Nursing and Patient Safety Network (REBRAENSP, in Portuguese). Nearly all Brazilian states have REBRAENSP hubs and centers, which create valuable settings for discussions that impact healthcare, teaching and research practices. For healthcare to be safe, it is necessary to build a culture of safety, which the National Patient Safety Program(2) defines as:a culture under which all workers, including healthcare providers and managers, take responsibility for their own safety and that of their coworkers, patients, and family members; a culture that places safety above financial and operating goals; a culture that encourages and rewards people to spot, notify about, and solve safety-related problems;a culture which, after an incident has taken place, fosters education within the organization; and a culture that supplies resources, a framework, and accountability for safety to be effectively upheld. As we can see, the challenges in the way of developing a patient safety culture are massive but not insurmountable, and encompass the need to set effective strategies on three fronts: healthcare professional education, overall healthcare, and research. In education, the topic of patient safety should be included throughout the curriculum and focus on specific risks and measures to prevent harm in the various healthcare scenarios. Patient safety should be addressed by means of teaching-learning actions through which students and educators experience significant practices that lead to safe work {{in the course of their}} training and which are sustained into their professional work. To that end, educators need to uphold permanent/continued education strategies, and the teaching projects for undergraduate/graduate and technical programs need clear guidelines sothe safety aspect is not minimized among other important ones in healthcare education. When providing healthcare at all levels, one’s eyes must look beyond one’s own professional practice towards the multiple factors that endanger patient safety in the process of care. All actions become more complex within this scope of healthcare and require intense, coordinated efforts for healthcare processes to be feasible starting from their planning. In other words, regulations, procedures, routines, strategic maps, checklists, and others must be actually implemented to advance safety and impact the quality of healthcare. Another extremely relevant aspect requires changing the culture of punishment that penalizes the professionals and fails to look into the context in which a safety incident has occurred. Such outdated model still guides the actions of many managers and institutions, and ends up leading tothe recurrence of safety incidents instead of to their prevention...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} {{predictors of}} {{the adoption of}} <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> by mothers of 2 year old children. SETTING: 26 municipalities in the county of Sogn and Fjordane, and four municipalities in the county of Møre and Romsdal in Norway. METHODS: Data was collected by questionnaires mailed to all mothers of 2 year olds in the 30 municipalities (response rate 70. 7 %, n = 1233). Information was obtained on socioeconomic variables, the child's injury history, adoption of <b>safety</b> <b>measures,</b> and variables describing mother's health related beliefs (parent health locus of control) {{and the value of}} health (health value). RESULTS: Income, municipality of residence, age of the mother, and marital status were significantly associated with the reported adoption of <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> High income and older, married mothers were positively associated with the adoption of <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The significant effect of income on the adoption of <b>safety</b> <b>measures,</b> underlined by the fact that <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> were less often adopted by young single mothers, may indicate that the implementation of structural measures such as loan schemes and subsidies, are necessary to increase the adoption of child <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> The lack of association between education and social cognitive beliefs, respectively, and the adoption of <b>safety</b> <b>measures,</b> offer less optimism for traditional health education initiatives...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} has been {{designed}} to investigate the influence of particular diagnostic categories on recommendations for <b>safety</b> <b>measures,</b> and to investigate the impact of constellatory factors, as the states of acute alcoholism, acute intoxication by psychoactive drugs and intense affect, on the recommendations for <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> The sample consisted of 120 examinees forensically expertised at the Center for Forensic Psychiatry of the Psychiatric Hospital Vrap~e in the period from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 1999, and evaluated as less responsible according to the new Penal Code. All the examinees had the same legal presumptions for <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> (decreased responsibility). The sample was divided into two groups: a group of examinees for whom a <b>safety</b> <b>measure</b> had been recommended and a group without such recommendations. The basic methodological instrument was a specially designed questionnaire with 137 items. Regarding socio-demographic characteristics, no statistically significant differences existed between the two groups taking into account age, gender, level of education and marstatus. The diagnosis of personality disorder, as the first one, did not influence recommendations for <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> Alcohol and drug abuse were statistically significantly present in the group with recommended measures as second diagnoses, and besides influencing responsibility, {{had an impact on the}} recommendation of <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> An intense affect influenced the reduction of responsibility, but not the suggestion of <b>safety</b> <b>measure,</b> while alcohol and drug intoxications, besides affecting responsibility, had an impact on the suggestion of <b>safety</b> <b>measure.</b> The decisive impact of dependence influenced the recommendation for <b>safety</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{conceptual}} framework {{that can be used}} to assess the extent to which the findings of road safety evaluation research make sense from a theoretical point of view. The effects of road <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> are modelled as passing through two causal chains. One of these, termed the engineering effect, refers to the intended effects of a road <b>safety</b> <b>measure</b> on a set of risk factors related to accident occurrence or injury severity. The engineering effect of road <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> is modelled in terms of eight basic risk factors, one or more of which any road <b>safety</b> <b>measure</b> needs to influence in order to have the intended effect on accidents or injuries. The other causal chain producing the effects of road <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> is termed the behavioural effect, and refers to road user behavioural adaptations to road <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> The behavioural effect is related to the engineering effect, in the sense that certain properties of the engineering effect of a road <b>safety</b> <b>measure</b> influence the likelihood that behavioural adaptation will occur. The behavioural effect of a road <b>safety</b> <b>measure</b> is modelled in terms of five conditions that influence the likelihood that behavioural adaptation will occur. The eight generic risk factors representing the engineering effect of a road <b>safety</b> <b>measure,</b> and the five items representing the likelihood of behavioural adaptation can be used as checklists in assessing whether or not the findings of road safety evaluation studies make sense from a theoretical point of view. At the current state of knowledge, a more stringent evaluation of the extent to which theory can explain the findings of road safety evaluation studies is, in most cases, not possible...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Still {{too many}} deaths and {{injuries}} {{are a result}} of road safety limitations within Europe. Road <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> aimed to change the road environment to reduce the risks on driver errors and to reduce the seriousness of the effects of driver errors are expected to increase road safety. A suitable combination of new technologies with existing infrastructure, or with limited improvements of it, may lead to much more cost-effective solutions (Brookhuis et al. 2006). The In-Safety project was aimed at determining which <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> are expected to be most effective and in the project also evaluations were performed in pilot sites and modeling laboratories. Methods The methodological approach for the selection and prioritization of the initial set of <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> is presented and discussed, based on an accident analysis. First, the general approach is described, then the method is presented including the definition of a scenario, how accident statistics are used as a starting point, the generation of <b>safety</b> <b>measures,</b> and the method of selection of <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> Finally, the AHP multicriteria analysis method, involved in the final prioritisation of the selected <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> is presented briefly.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Concern {{with the}} costs of blood safety is growing, which raises the {{question}} whether <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> that reduce risk only marginally should be discontinued. Withdrawing such <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> would allow reallocating resources to more efficient health care interventions, but it might raise moral objections. Materials and Methods: This study evaluates two ethical arguments why discontinuing blood <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> would be more objectionable than not implementing them. The first argument is that whereas withdrawing protective measures causes harm to patients, not starting protective measures 'merely' omits to prevent harm. The second argument is that patients who benefit from protective measures are historically entitled to the continuation of those protective measures. Results: Both arguments are unconvincing. There is only a weak causal connection between removing blood <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> and harms that transfusion recipients suffer. Moreover, patients are not entitled to the continuation of protective measures that prove very inefficient, unless applying these protective measures rectifies past injustice towards them. Conclusion: Unless stronger ethical objections can be found, blood system operators and regulators should be more willing to withdraw inefficient <b>safety</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

40|$|Collision {{avoidance}} system (CAS), {{with the}} help of surrogate <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> is a beneficial tool for reducing driver errors and preventing rear-end collisions. One of the most well-known surrogate <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> to detect rear-end conflicts is Time-to-collision (TTC). TTC refers to the time remaining before the rear-end accident if the course and the speed of vehicles are maintained constant. Different surrogate measures have been derived from TTC; however, the most important are Time Exposed Time-to-collision (TET) and Time Integrated Time-to-collision (TIT). In this paper a new surrogate <b>safety</b> <b>measure</b> based on TTC notion has been developed. This new indicator merges TET and TIT into one measure and gives a score between 0 and 100 %, as the probability of collision. Applying this indicator in CAS as a <b>safety</b> <b>measure</b> will be more useful than TET&TIT, to reduce driver errors and rear-end collisions. </p...|$|R
