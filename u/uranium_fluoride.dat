This work was published in Transactions of the American Electrochemical Society in 1910. He continued working on electrodeposition of metals from perchloric solutions. During the first World War, he was asked to come to Washington to prepare fluorine by Wilder Dwight Bancroft, then a Major in the Chemical Warfare Service. Mathers designed an electrochemical cell which was named after him. It produced fluorine by electrolysis of potassium hydrogen fluoride. A modification of his process was used to make fluorine for the preparation of <b>uranium</b> <b>fluoride</b> for the nuclear reactor. Most of his research carried out independently and with his students was on electroplating. He developed a process for the plating of tin and found that aluminum could be plated successfully from a bath of aluminum halides and aromatic hydrocarbons. He authored more than 130 papers in Transactions of the American Electrochemical Society. In addition to his academic work, he spent many summers working in industry.|$|E

Variable amounts of HF((aq)) were added to a series of reaction gels in which all other reactant concentrations were invariant, resulting {{in the formation of}} three different phases, depending upon the fluoride concentration. Two of these phases are novel; [N(2) C(4) H(14) ][UO(2) (H(2) O) (SO(4)) (2) ] is a new templated uranium sulfate, containing anionic [UO(2) (H(2) O) (SO(4)) (2) ](2 -) chains that hydrogen bond to one-another forming pseudo-layers, and [N(2) C(4) H(14) ][UO(2) F(SO(4)) ](2) is the first example of a templated uranium sulfate fluoride, which consists of <b>uranium</b> <b>fluoride</b> chains linked by sulfate groups to form [UO(2) F(SO(4)) ](-) layers. The role of F(-) in these reactions is two-fold; it acts as a mineraliser when present in small concentrations, while it is incorporated into the reaction product when present in larger mole fractions. Both of the new materials have been characterised using a range of physical techniques including single crystal X-ray structure analysis...|$|E

The objective was to prepare ammonium <b>uranium</b> <b>fluoride</b> double salts from uranium dioxide and ammonium bifluoride, then decompose these salts to uranium tetrafluoride through heating to temperatures near 425 'C in either a fluidized bed or a stirred bed. Fluorination in the stirred bed was attempted without pretreatment of the reagents. For the fluidized bed experiments, reagents were ball-milled prior to being heated in the bed. Experiments were conducted in either argon or 4 % hydrogen in argon. The ball mill appeared to be an effective technique for fluorinating uranium dioxide with ammonium bifluoride. Samples changed color from brown to bright green, and no oxides could be detected in the x-ray diffraction pattern of the product. It was found that stainless steel is a suitable material of construction for reaction vessels, whereas mild steel parts corroded quickly. Only a small degree of fluidization provided adequate mixing in fluidized beds, but a paddle mixing the stirred beds left an unmixed region around the bed perimeter.

40|$|Conversion, {{the process}} by which natural uranium ore (yellowcake) is puriﬁed and {{converted}} through a series of chemical processes into uranium hexaﬂuoride gas (UF 6), has historically been excluded from the nuclear safeguards requirements of the 235 U-based nuclear fuel cycle. With each step in the conversion process from yellowcake to feedstock for UF 6, intermediary uranium oxide and <b>uranium</b> <b>ﬂuoride</b> compounds become progressively attractive products for diversion toward activities noncompliant with international treaties. The diversion of this product material could potentially provide feedstock for a clandestine or undeclared enrichment for weapons development for state or non-state entities. With the realization of this potential, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has only recently reinterpreted its policies to emphasize safeguarding this feedstock in response to such diversion pathways. This project employs a combination of simulation models and experimental measurements to develop and validate concepts of nondestructive assay monitoring systems in a natural uranium conversion plant (NUCP). In particular, uranyl nitrate (UN) solution exiting solvent extraction was identiﬁed as a key measurement point (KMP), where gamma-ray spectroscopy was selected as the process-monitoring tool. The Uranyl Nitrate Calibration Loop Equipment (UNCLE) facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory was employed to simulate the full-scale operating conditions of a puriﬁed uranium-bearing aqueous stream exiting the solvent extraction process in an NUCP.

They are {{a key element in}} the production processes of cement, lime and pigments, for the reduction of ore in extractive metallurgy and for the pyrolysis of solid waste. They are also used to convert <b>uranium</b> <b>fluoride</b> into uranium dioxide for the production of nuclear fuel. In this kind of device, hydrodynamic, thermal and chemical modelling processes are linked, as {{it is clear that the}} temperature profiles of the solid and the gas in the kiln directly influence the chemical reaction kinetics that occur. It is thus essential to be able to calculate precisely the temperature of the solid and of the gas at any point in the kiln and to understand the heat exchanges in the kiln. Various correlations are reported in the literature for estimating the heat transfer coefficients in rotary kiln. However, for a given kiln, the heat transfer coefficient values calculated by using these correlations are highly scattered. Moreover, experimental measurements of heat transfer in rotary kilns are scarce. The aim of this work is thus to design and construct an adaptable experimental setup to study heat exchange in rotary kilns. A key point is that the operating mode of the experimental setup must be similar to those of the rotary kilns used for the conversion of uranium. In particular, our kiln is externally heated and equipped with lifters. The design of our experimental device will be described, focusing on the heating mode chosen and on the instrumentation. A special attention will also be devoted to the preliminary results obtained concerning the influence of the solid flow rate and the rotational speed on the heat transfer coefficient between the wall of the rotary kiln and the solid flowing through the kiln...|$|E
40|$|An ideal {{method of}} {{construction}} in space would utilize {{some form of}} the Universal Differentiator and Universal Constructor as described by Von Neumann (1). The Universal Differentiator is an idealized non ore specific extractive device which is capable of breaking any ore into its constituent elements, and the Universal Constructor can utilize these elements to build any device with controllability to the nanometer scale. During the Human Exploration Initiative program in the early 1990 s a conceptual study was done (2) to understand whether such devices were feasible with near term technology for the utilization of space resources and energy. A candidate system was proposed which would utilize electronically enhanced sputtering as the differentiator. Highly ionized ions would be accelerated to a kinetic energy at which the interaction {{between them and the}} lattice elections in the ore would be at a maximum. Experiments have shown that the maximum disintegration of raw material occurs at an ion kinetic energy of about 5 MeV, regardless of the composition and structure of the raw material. Devices that could produce charged ion beams in this energy range in space were being tested in the early 1990 s. At this energy, for example an ion in a beam of fluorine ions yields about 8 uranium ions from <b>uranium</b> <b>fluoride,</b> 1, 400 hydrogen and oxygen atoms from ice, or 7, 000 atoms from sulfur dioxide ice. The ions from the disintegrated ore would then be driven by an electrical field into a discriminator {{in the form of a}} mass spectrometer, where the magnetic field would divert the ions into collectors for future use or used directly in molecular beam construction techniques. The process would require 10 - 7 Torr vacuum which would be available in space or on the moon.

40|$|A {{computational}} model {{based on the}} axisymmetric, thin-layer Navier-Stokes equations is developed to predict the convective, radiation and conductive heat transfer in high temperature space nuclear reactors. An implicit-explicit, finite volume, MacCormack method {{in conjunction with the}} Gauss-Seidel line iteration procedure is utilized to solve the thermal and fluid governing equations. Simulation of coolant and propellant flows in these reactors involves the subsonic and supersonic flows of hydrogen, helium and uranium tetrafluoride under variable boundary conditions. An enthalpy-rebalancing scheme is developed and implemented to enhance and accelerate the rate of convergence when a wall heat flux boundary condition is used. The model also incorporated the Baldwin and Lomax two-layer algebraic turbulence scheme for the calculation of the turbulent kinetic energy and eddy diffusivity of energy. The Rosseland diffusion approximation is used to simulate the radiative energy transfer in the optically thick environment of gas core reactors. The {{computational model}} is benchmarked with experimental data on flow separation angle and drag force acting on a suspended sphere in a cylindrical tube. The heat transfer is validated by comparing the computed results with the standard heat transfer correlations predictions. The model is used to simulate flow and heat transfer under a variety of design conditions. The effect of internal heat generation on the heat transfer in the gas core reactors is examined for a variety of power densities, 100 W/cc, 500 W/cc and 1000 W/cc. The maximum temperature, corresponding with the heat generation rates, are 2150 K, 2750 K and 3550 K, respectively. This analysis shows that the maximum temperature is strongly dependent on the value of heat generation rate. It also indicates that a heat generation rate higher than 1000 W/cc is necessary to maintain the gas temperature at about 3500 K, which is typical design temperature required to achieve high efficiency in the gas core reactors. The model is also used to predict the convective and radiation heat fluxes for the gas core reactors. The maximum value of heat flux occurs at the exit of the reactor core. Radiation heat flux increases with higher wall temperature. This behavior {{is due to the fact}} that the radiative heat flux is strongly dependent on wall temperature. This study also found that at temperature close to 3500 K the radiative heat flux is comparable with the convective heat flux in a <b>uranium</b> <b>fluoride</b> failed gas core reactor...|$|E

When operated at atmospheric pressure, they consist of a cylindrical shell that can be inclined, into which the solid charge is fed continuously at one end and discharged at the other.

Though the operational cost of these units is usually high, their design is often conservative {{due to the lack of}} fundamental physical understanding of both solid flow and heat transfer. The objective of this presentation is to provide a new model to predict the mean residence time, axial dispersion coefficient and hold-up of fine to coarse solid particles within the rotary kiln based on a dimensional analysis. Flow of material through a rotary kiln depends on many factors: length and diameter of the kiln, design and number of lifters distributed around the circumference, rotational speed and slope of the kiln, exit dam height at the kiln outlet end, flow rate and physical properties of the material. Experiments were carried out on two pilot-scale rotary kilns at room temperature, whether equipped or not with different kinds of lifters or fitted with a dam at the outlet end. These experiments aimed at determining the effects of most of the factors listed above on the Residence Time Distribution of solid particles. The tracer impulse-response technique was used to establish residence time distribution curves. Four granular solids having different properties were used: fine and medium sand, broken rice and beech chips. The other operational parameters were also varied, maintaining the cascading (tumbling) motion. We have already presented* the results on the smaller kiln with two types of particles.

40|$|The {{importance}} of pyrochemistry is being increasingly acknowledged and becomes unavoidable {{in the nuclear}} field. Molten salts {{may be used for}} fuel processing and spent fuel recycling, for heat transfer, as a homogeneous fuel and as a breeder material in fusion systems. Fluorides that are stable at high temperature and under high neutron flux are especially promising. Analysis of several field cases reveals that corrosion in molten fluorides is essentially due to the oxidation of metals by <b>uranium</b> <b>fluoride</b> and/or oxidizing impurities. The thermodynamics of this process are discussed with an emphasis on understanding the mass transfer in the systems, selecting appropriate metallic materials and designing effective purification methods. High temperature molten salts based on chloride or fluoride compounds have several applications in the nuclear field. In the front-end nuclear fuel cycle, molten salts are used for the purification and production of zirconium alloy, which is used as fuel cladding. Then, a pyrochemical treatment in NaCl-AlCl 3 molten salt at 350 °C enables the separation of zirconium and hafnium, which is a neutronic poison 1. In the nuclear fuel fabrication process, conversion of uranium oxide ore requires large quantities of fluorine that is obtained by the electrolysis of 2 HF-KF molten salt at 95 °C 2. Several pyrochemical processes based on chloride or fluoride molten salts have also been conceived in the back-end nuclear fuel cycle, to separate actinides from lanthanides during nuclear waste recycling 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. Because fluoride mixtures are thermodynamically stable at high temperature, with very high boiling points, these liquids have been considered as heat transfer or cooling fluids, as coolants for thermal energy 10 and 11 and in nuclear fission and fusion systems. Several criteria have to be considered when choosing a structural material: mechanical strength at high temperature, irradiation resistance (in the case of materials under neutron flux) and chemical corrosion resistance (which depends on the material composition and microstructure, and on the physical chemistry of the molten salt). As it will be shown, in order to avoid corrosion the liquid fluoride salt coolant must be thermodynamically stable relative to the chosen materials. If molten salts are already industrially used in the front-end nuclear fuel cycle or considered for alternative nuclear spent fuel recycling in the back-end fuel cycle, then the material development and the corrosion studies are essentially performed within the frame of the development of future nuclear reactors: Molten Salt Reactors (MSR), Advanced High Temperature Reactors (AHTR) and Tokamak fusion power plants. For all these cases, the selected molten salt is a fluoride salt mixture. Indeed, the material resistance is a key issue in all applications, but especially so in the case of reactor core use; {{not only because of the}} irradiation damage, but also because the operating temperature is determined by the fission reaction and cannot be decreased easily e. g. in case of pit formation. In the other applications the reactor can be cooled more easily.

It introduced {{the idea of a}} homogeneous reactor using fuel salt media and graphite moderation for power and breeder reactors. The MSRE reactor and associated components are located in cells beneath the floor in the high-bay area of Building 7503 (Figure 1). The reactor was operated from June 1965 to December 1969. When the reactor was shut down, fuel salt was drained from the reactor circuit to two drain tanks. A ''clean'' salt was then circulated through the reactor as a decontamination measure and drained to a third drain tank. When operations ceased, the fuel and flush salts were allowed t o cool and solidify in the drain tanks. At shutdown, the MSRE facility complex was placed in a surveillance and maintenance program. As a result of the S&M program, it was discovered in 1994 that gaseous uranium (233 U/ 232 U) hexafluoride (UF 6) had moved throughout the MSRE process systems.

Rotary kilns are used for applications such as reduction of oxide ore, pyrolysis of hazardous waste, calcining of petroleum coke, conversion of <b>uranium</b> <b>fluoride</b> into uranium dioxide for the manufacture of nuclear fuel, and so on. When operated at atmospheric pressure, they consist of a cylindrical shell that can be inclined, into which the solid charge is fed continuously at one end and discharged at the other. They can be equipped with lifting flights or lifters, and/or dam(s) at the kiln end(s). They are classified into two main heating modes: either directly heated or indirectly heated, depending on the heating source location with respect to the solid material. They usually require very little labor to operate. Heat transfer in rotary kilns is very complex and may involve the exchange of energy via all the fundamental physical transfer mechanisms that are, conduction, convection, and radiation. There has been a significant amount of studies dealing with this subject in the literature. Although many researchers studied the main phenomena occurring in the kiln, the heat transfer between the wall and particles is not yet well understood. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the wall-to-solids heat transfer coefficient. The effects of various operational parameters such as the filling degree, the rotational speed, lifters profile as well as the temperature set point at the outer wall on the mentioned heat transfer coefficient are also analyzed in this study. A series of experiments were carried out on a pilot scale rotary kiln at atmospheric pressure, whether or not equipped with lifters and fitted with dam at the outlet end. The experimental rotary kiln is externally heated by electrical resistance and equipped with thermocouples positioned at five cross-sections, in and outside along the kiln tube. These experiments aimed at recording the heating up of the wall, gas and solid particles after turning on the heating system until temperatures are stabilized; the afore-mentioned coefficient was determined from the temperature profiles measurements data for low and medium wall temperature set point. The bulk materials used was quartz sand (average size 0. 55 mm) with a narrow distributed size fraction. Furthermore, two shapes of lifters were compared to determine the influence of lifter and their geometry: straight lifters (SL) and rectangular lifters (RL). The other operational parameters mentioned were also varied so that a matrix of about 60 experiments (without including repeatability tests) was achieved. The solids temperature fluctuations after the start of the heating system can be considered as response of a first-order system, therefore characterized by a time constant. Results show that the time constant decrease with the temperature set point at the outer wall and the filling degree, but increase in presence of lifters. However for the two types of lifters used, the time constant remains of the same order of magnitude. Calculation of the heat transfer coefficient has been done from the overall heat balance ODE, its analytical solution and the time constant. The third method of calculation give results an order of magnitude greater than the first two but follow similar tendency. The heat transfer coefficient from wall to solids seems to decrease in presence of lifters and increase with the filling degree. The heat transfer coefficient also increases with the temperature set point at the outer wall as well as the rotational speed (for a constant filling degree) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRotary kilns are gas-solid {{reactors}} {{commonly used}} in industry to achieve {{a wide range of}} material processing operations: mixing, heating or cooling, reacting of coarse, free-flowing or cohesive solids. Therefore rotary kilns are used for applications such as reduction of oxide ore, pyrolysis of biomass or hazardous waste, calcining of petroleum coke, conversion of <b>uranium</b> <b>fluoride</b> for the manufacture of nuclear fuel, and so on. When operated at atmospheric pressure, these units consist of a cylindrical shell that can be inclined, into which the solids burden is fed continuously at one end and discharged at the other. Most of them are equipped with lifting flights or lifters, and/or exit dam at the kiln outlet end. They can be classified into two main heating modes; they can be either directly heated or indirectly heated, depending on the heating source position with respect to the kiln’s tube wall. They usually require very little labor to operate in comparison with other industrial reactors. Though operational cost of these units is usually high, their design and intended operating conditions are often conservative {{due to the lack of}} fundamental understanding notably upon the solids flow behavior and the heat transfer mechanisms. Heat transfer in rotary kilns is very complex and may involve the exchange of energy via all the fundamental physical transfer mechanisms that are, conduction, convection, and radiation. There have been quite a few studies dealing with this subject in the literature. Although many researchers studied the main phenomena occurring in the kiln, the heat transfer between the wall and solid particles, or the (free) convection of non forced gas are not yet well understood. The present study investigates the convective gas-to-wall heat transfer coefficient, in the case of a non-forced air flow, and the wall-to-solids heat transfer coefficient. These coefficients were first experimentally determined, and then correlated based on a dimensional analysis, so to be used in a global model for rotary kilns. A series of experiments were carried out on a pilot scale rotary kiln at atmospheric pressure, whether or not equipped with lifters and fitted with a dam at the outlet end. The experimental apparatus, 1. 95 m in length and 0. 01 m in (internal) diameter, can be externally heated in two independent consecutive zones by electrical resistance up to 1000 °C. Regarding the thermal metrology, thermocouples are positioned at five and four cross-sections, respectively in and outside along the kiln tube. Hence, after turning on the heating system, axial temperature profiles of gas, wall and solids were measured until steady state is achieved. Both coefficients were determined from the temperature profiles measurements data for low and medium wall temperature set point comprises between 100 and 500 °C. In particular for the wall-to-solids heat transfer coefficient, the bulk materials used was quartz sand (average size about half a millimeter) with a narrow distributed size fraction; No solids were fed into the kiln when studying the air convection inside the kiln. Two shapes of lifters were compared to determine the influence of lifters presence and their geometry on the heat transfer: straight (one-section) lifters and rectangular (two-section) lifters (RL). The kiln operating conditions examined also include: the rotational speed (2 - 12 rpm), the mass flow rate (0. 8 - 2. 5 kg/h) and the exit dam height at the kiln outlet end (23. 5 - 33. 5 mm). An experimental matrix of about eighty experiments was achieved. For the determination of the experimental value, the lumped system analysis and a heat balance accounting for the measured power supplied for the heating are used. Results showed that the wall-to-gas convective heat transfer coefficient is significantly lower that what can be expected for natural convection. Though only small variations were observed, still some trends could be observed in presence of lifters, and when varying the rotational speed. The wall-to-solids heat transfer coefficient was notably lower in presence of lifters. It was also found to increase with the temperature set at the wall and the filling degree, which is imposed by the operating conditions set. Dimensional correlations were developed to describe these two heat transfer mechanisms from the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} multi-disciplinary {{approach to the}} analysis of ancient bones, in which many different chemical and physical analytical techniques were applied to a relatively small sample of human and animal bones from different depositional environments. The results of these analyses indicate that the principle mechanisms responsible for diagenetic alteration of buried bones are chemical hydrolysis of bone collagen and microscopic tunnelling by saprophytic micro-organisms. These mechanisms, either independently or together, result in an increase in the porosity of the bone at a microscopic scale from a value of approximately 20 percent in fresh bone up to as much as 65 percent in some archaeological bones. There {{is no evidence that the}} hydrolysis of collagen in buried bones directly affects the mineral component of bone, although the breaking of the intimate association between the collagen molecules and the bone apatite crystallites exposes the crystallites to potential dissolution and recrystallization by percolating ground water. Disruption of the collagen-apatite bond has been recognised in optical microscopy of thin sections by loss of the characteristic birefringence seen in unaltered bone when viewed in polarised light. The birefringence in histologically normal bone results from the strongly anisotropic orientation of the bone mineral crystallites imposed by their association with the highly organised collagen fibrils. Loss of birefringence as a result of diagenetic activity is attributed to a randomising of the orientation of crystallites after hydrolytic degradation of the collagen molecule. With progressive loss of collagen the relative calcium and phosphorus contents of fossil bones have been found to increase in proportions close to those of stoichiometrically correct hydroxyapatite. Microscopic and mineralogical studies have suggested that changes in the crystallinity of buried bones may be attributed to the presence of well-ordered crystals of hydroxyapatite in the pore structures of the bones and that these derive from dissolution and re-precipitation of the original bone apatite. However the elemental and isotopic composition of these re-precipitated apatites may not reflect that of the original bio mineral due to the incorporation of strontium, <b>uranium</b> <b>fluoride</b> etc. from the environment. Dissolution of bone mineral can, in most cases, be associated with the action of micro-organisms, many of which are known to favour low pHs and secrete organic acids as a by-product of their metabolism. Although micro-organisms isolated from buried bones produce collagen degrading enzymes (collagenases) these enzymes are too large to enter the spaces between the bone apatite crystallites and are therefore unable to attack the collagenous matrix of undegraded bone. Before micro-organisms can utilise bone collagen, the bone matrix must first be demineralized to expose the collagen fibrils or the collagen must be degraded by hydrolysis into shorter lengths that then escape via disrupted regions of the surrounding crystallites. Analysis of the strengths of modem and fossil bones has demonstrated a near logarithmic relationship between tensile strength and porosity. In addition, plots of strength vs porosity and strength vs nitrogen content are bimodal, indicating that two mechanisms are involved in the degradation of fossil bones. The microscopic and chemical analyses suggest that these mechanisms are chain scissioning of collagen and tunnelling by micro-organisms. Microscopic studies show that surface adsorption of 'humic acids' and metal ions are responsible for the colouration of fossil bones. Analysis of the total lipid extract of fossil bones contain cholesterol and cholesterol degradation products. Fossil cholesterol represents a potentially important and unique resource for palaeodietary studies. Conversely, this research has demonstrated that studies of ancient DNA are compounded by inhibition by compounds from the soil and contamination by modem DNA. Fossil bones in anoxic or wateriogged soils are readily colonised by sulphate-reducing bacteria and these bacteria are responsible for the deposition of iron sulphide in the form of pyrite framboids in pore spaces in the bone. On exposure to atmospheric oxygen, these pyrite framboids oxidise to sulphuric acid which in turn attacks bone apatite, resulting in the formation of vivianite (Fe(_ 3) (PO(_ 4)) (_ 2). 8 H(_ 2) O) and gypsum (CaSO(_ 4). 2 H(_ 2) O). Crystallization and hydration of these minerals frequently disrupt the physical integrity of the bone specimens. Finally this research indicates potential regimes for the conservation of fossil bone specimens together with the archaeological or environmental evidence preserved within them...|$|E

40|$|A 'Feasibility Study on the Commercialized Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) Cycle System' is {{underway}} at Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute (JNC). Concepts to commercialize the FBR fuel cycle are being created {{together with their}} necessary research and development (R&D) tasks. 'Dry,' non-aqueous, processes are candidates for FBR fuel reprocessing. Dry reprocessing technology takes advantage of proliferation barriers, due to the lower decontamination factors achievable by the simple pyrochemical processes proposed. The concentration o f highly radioactive impurities and non-fissile materials in products from a dry reprocess is generally significantly larger than the normal aqueous (Purex) process. However, the safeguards of dry reprocesses have not been widely analyzed. In 2000, JNC and Los Alamos National Laboratoiy (LANL) initiated a joint research program to study the safeguards aspects of dry reprocessing. In this study, the safeguardability of the three options: metal electrorefining, oxide electrowinning, and fluoride volatility processes, are assessed. FBR spent fuels are decladded and powdered into mixed oxides (MOX) at the Head-End process either by oxidation-reduction reactions (metal electrorefining and fluoride volatility) or mechanically (oxide electrowinning). At the oxide electrowinning process, the spent MOX he 1 powder is transferred to chloride in molten salt and nuclear materials are extracted onto cathode as oxides. For metal electrorefining process, on the other hand, the MOX fuel is converted to chloride in molten salt, and nuclear materials are extracted onto cathode as a metal fomi. At lhe fluoride volatility process, the MOX fuel powder is converted to U&/PuF 6 (gaseous form) in a fluidized bed; plutonium and <b>uranium</b> <b>fluorides</b> are separated by volatilization properties and then are converted to oxides. Since the conceptual design of a dry reprocessing plant is incomplete, the operational mode, vessel capacities, residence times, and campaigns are not fully defined. Preliminary estimates of the longest acccptable campaign length while still meets loss detection goals were made using typical measurement errors and annual throughputs of plutonium within the facility. For all reprocessing facilities, both in-process inventory and the input/output materials measurements must be determined for closing the materials balance. Usually, operations are {{to be shut down}} periodically and plants are to be completely cleaned out to recover all materials in measurable forms during inventories. If there is no cleanout between campaigns, fluctuations of in-process inventory have to be monitored. We conclude that the three dry reprocessing methods will have adequate safeguardability, if limited to small-scale campaigns or to low annual throughputs. For a large scale, e. g,. 50 t(HM) /y FBR fuel reprocessing plant, there remain challenges to be addressed through process development in JNC and safeguards R&D study with LANL...|$|R
