Inputs to the routines were acoustic pulse transit times from the target to receiving array elements which are non-linear functions of the position coordinates. These inputs were linearized and the filter gains calculated on-line. Simulated runs were conducted for tracks in the area of one hydrophone array and for tracks that transited through multiple arrays. It was found that the sequential estimate routine exhibited better performance in recovering from transients caused by random measurement noise or target movement. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

Applying it to underwater acoustic countermeasure (UAC) is bound to achieve certain results. So it is important and necessary to assess the effect of bubble curtain on underwater acoustic (UWA) communication. In this paper, we commence from the bubble resonance theory and apply the Bellhop ray model in analyzing the bubble curtain which damps the impact signal at different depths and bubble curtain ranges and verify the correctness of the model. With this method, we get the impact of bubble curtain on underwater acoustic communication based on frequency shift keying (FSK) modulation by simulation and laboratory experiment...|$|R

The HP- 86 provided accurate, reliable results and it could be used for on-line graphics. However, the computing speed fo the HP- 86 computer as used in this study was too slow for on-line processing of the three-dimensional tracking problem. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
