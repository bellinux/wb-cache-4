Russo specifically found a Synthi AKS synthesizer for the show, as that instrument was used during the making of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, one of Hawley's favorite albums and what Russo described as [...] "the sound of schizophrenia, the sound of mental illness in the ’70s.

He wanted her killed off at this episode, as he was the one who created Connie in the sixth series, and felt it gratifying to kill off a character he created.

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1882, Riley's {{finances}} {{began to}} improve dramatically, thanks largely to the income from his performances. During 1883 he began writing his [...] "Boone County" [...] poems by the pseudonym [...] "Benjamin F. Johnson of Boone." [...] The poems were almost entirely written in dialect and emphasized topics of rural life during the early nineteenth century, often employing nostalgia and the simplicity of country life as elements. [...] "The Old Swimmin'-Hole" [...] and [...] "When the Frost Is on the Punkin'" [...] were the most popular, and helped earn the entire series critical acclaim. The topics were popular with readers, reminding many of them of their childhood. Merrill, Meigs & Company (later renamed Bobbs-Merrill Company) approached Riley to compile the poems into a book. Riley agreed and printing of his first book began in August 1883, titled [...] "The Old Swimmin'-Hole and 'Leven More Poems". The book's popularity necessitated a second printing {{before the end of}} the year. During this period Riley determined that his most popular poems were those on topics of rural life, and he began to <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a common theme throughout his future work.|$|E

Leading up to the episode's broadcast, executive producer Jeff Pinkner remarked {{in a conference call}} with journalists that it was a [...] "game-changer" [...] because [...] "our characters learn a lot more and the audience is going to learn a lot more about the über-plot of the season’s bad guy, David Robert Jones."

500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} were written by Manson as she {{included}} and filtered some of her bandmates' ideas on songwriting. [...] "It was a very do-it-yourself, homemade thing {{when it comes down}} to it", Erikson explained; [...] "We all pitch in. Shirley had just as many comments on the guitar parts or the sound of the guitars as anybody else, and likewise, if we don't like a lyric, we say it right away." [...] Many songs have a more optimistic view in life, inspired by Manson overcoming a desire to quit music after the death of her mother and realizing how important her work is to her. Darker themes still appear as Manson described herself as [...] "enthusiastic and passionate, but I do see death marching toward me." [...] "Blood for Poppies" [...] came [...] "from a lot of things", Manson said; [...] "It's really an analogy for a story I read about Afghanistan and the opium wars over there ... it's from a few stories, one about a platoon of soldiers in Afghanistan and the other about the opium wars. I <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a backdrop for a story about maintaining sanity in an out-of-control place." [...] " [...] remaining sane, when faced with insanity", she added. [...] "I Hate Love" [...] criticized [...] "the commercialized idea of love and what pain that puts us through" [...] along with [...] "knowing that there will be no more torture in your life than really, truly loving somebody who doesn't love you back." [...] Manson also incorporated some self-confidence and knowledge of her personality achieved during acting classes, in which she accepted that [...] "was never going to be the cheerleader or the beautiful, conventional girl who fits in everywhere." ...|$|E

2500|$|Noble's {{style is}} {{recognized}} as spontaneous, due to his unpredictable performance style, interruptions from hecklers or because he has drifted off into another surreal conversation. During his shows he is known to dabble onto one topic, ask {{a member of the}} audience something about him or herself and <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> material, and carry on with that, and later on seems to forget about, digressing into another topic. Thus the audience pesters Noble to tell the ending of his unfinished stories, which are usually eventually concluded {{at the end of his}} shows. His most famous example is in his Randomist tour, where he started to tell a story about him being interviewed after Live 8 near the beginning of a show in Newcastle, which he did not finish until the end of the performance, around two hours later. This relates to an earlier comment he made in his Regent's Park show, saying that his mind [...] "Tends to wander off [...] slightly", and later added that [...] " [...] can open up too many tangents at once... it's a never-ending expanding spiral of possibilities." [...] At which point, he forgot what he was talking about.|$|E
2500|$|Recurring {{elements}} {{center on}} one of five primary themes. The first deals with life on the island. A running gag is the castaways' ability to fashion {{a vast array of}} useful objects from bamboo and other local material. Some are simple everyday things, while others are stretches of the imagination. Russell Johnson noted in his autobiography that the production crew enjoyed the challenge of building these props. Some bamboo items include framed huts with thatched grass sides and roofs, along with bamboo closets strong enough to withstand hurricane-force winds and rain; the communal dining table and chairs, pipes for Gilligan's hot water, a stethoscope, and a pedal-powered car. Many scenes occur at the dining table, where the castaways enjoy a large number of dishes that Ginger and Mary Ann prepare while the radio provides news and entertainment. Gilligan and the Skipper often catch fish, and the island has citrus trees to avoid scurvy and a good supply of fresh water to drink and to prepare tropical drinks[...] While most are explained due to the Professor (or occasionally Gilligan's) ingenuity, sometimes they are also explained due to the being washed up on shore or falling off cargo ships. Naturally, despite their obvious skill and inventiveness, the castaways never quite manage to put together a functional raft out of bamboo (or repair the holes in the Minnow, though the entire ship fell apart in the eighth episode, [...] "Goodbye Island"). In the television movie Rescue from Gilligan's Island, the castaways tie all their huts together and <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a raft for escape, taking advantage of a tsunami's propulsion.|$|E

By January 2009, King was still deliberating over whether he would run, with the main factor being whether he could raise the estimated millions he would need. [...] National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair John Cornyn was said to support King, which could keep other Republican contenders out of play. [...] However, Cornyn has reportedly met with former Governor George Pataki to discuss his potential candidacy, which other Republicans were advocating. [...] In June 2009, due to an appointment to the House Intelligence Committee, King said he was much less likely to run. [...] As August 2009 closed, King announced officially that he would not run, saying: [...] "Senator Gillibrand generates neither strong support nor opposition. This makes it virtually impossible for me to raise the campaign funds I would need to overcome the built-in Democratic registration advantage and the countless millions of dollars which the Democrats will make available to Senator Gillibrand." [...] In September 2009, Giuliani reiterated that he had no interest at all in running for the Senate seat, [...] though, much like Andrew Cuomo's anticipated desire to run for governor, it did not stop speculation that Giuliani might change his mind, and by October 2009, speculation continued that Giuliani would run for the Senate seat, particularly if Cuomo ran for governor.
