In the western and {{north-western}} parts of the province, the region where Clay Frisian is spoken, the soil {{is made up of}} thick marine clay, hence the name. While in the Clay Frisian-speaking area ditches are used to separate the pastures, {{in the eastern part of}} the province, where the soil is sandy, and water sinks away much faster, rows of trees are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> purpose. The dialect spoken in the eastern area is thus called Wood Frisian.|$|E
25|$|The par score {{increases}} with every ball bowled and every wicket lost, {{as the amount}} of resource used increases. As an example, in the 2003 Cricket World Cup Final Australia batted first and scored 359 from 50 overs. As Australia completed their 50 overs, their total resources used R1=100%, so India's par score throughout their innings was: 359 x R2/100%, where R2 is the amount of resource <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> point. As shown in the first line of the table below, after 9 overs India were 57-1, and 41 overs and 9 wickets remaining equates to 85.3% of resources, so 100% minus& 85.3% = 14.7% had been used. India's par score after 9 overs was therefore 359 x 14.7%/100% = 52.773, which is rounded down to 52.|$|E

[...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was glad I had something in reserve.|$|E

Nevertheless, Halifax pulled away with the 125–91 victory, putting them one win away from the title. Rainmen forward Forrest Fisher complained about Windsor, [...] "They're playing very physical, and at times a little bit dirty with sucker punches, and we started playing into their game (Friday) and that's not us. A couple of us can play like that, myself included, and we came out tonight and I told them 'hey, let me take the hits, I'm <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> You guys play your normal game.' We play the way we play, and it doesn't matter how they play." [...] According to The Chronicle Herald, [...] "the game featured several incidents that threatened to escalate into a full-scale brawl." [...] The teams' coaches would frequently have to break up skirmishes and confront officials for what they felt were bad calls.|$|E
500|$|The result {{marked the}} first time that Liverpool had lost at the Millennium Stadium. Wenger used his post-match news {{interview}} to praise goalscorer Gilberto Silva and asserted that the Brazilian would be a [...] "very strong player" [...] for the team, in the incoming future. He noted that Dudek had [...] "kept [...] in the game for a long time" [...] and was critical of Gerrard, who he felt was fortunate not to have been sent off for a [...] "reckless and dangerous" [...] challenge on Vieira. Wenger believed Arsenal's experience put the team in good stead for the upcoming season: [...] "There are two attitudes to being champions. One is to get respect, another is to get kicked more and to face more aggression as people want to beat you more. We are quite <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> though as we have had some big fights in the past four or five years." ...|$|E

Frank advised on [...] "the human experience of space and time", helping Marvel conceive ideas for their cinematic multiverse, and suggesting dialogue for characters based on their beliefs, whether they were materialist, rationalist, reductionist, or [...] "had this enlarged perspective." [...] He noted that modern movie goers may not necessarily understand these complex scientific ideas, but do appear to appreciate [...] "amazing things happen from science. So by grounding your stories enough in science to not so much make them plausible, but to allow that science to open up new possibilities—people are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> in their lives. So I think {{it makes sense to}} them, and it's exciting to them". This was an aspect of previous MCU films that Frank called a [...] "great thing ... speaking as a scientist", saying that [...] "they build a coherent and consistent universe that respects the scientific process and that uses enough of real science to make things plausible or build off them." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{continues}} the storyline of Tom and Lynette's separation. Huffman enjoyed her character's storyline, stating: [...] "I'm {{sure there are}} things that they knew the viewers want, which is for Tom and Lynette to get back together. But I do like that it's kind of {{up in the air and}} maybe they won't." [...] Doug Savant commented, [...] "For many years on this show, we knew that Tom and Lynette were the grounding force on the street. They were the couple that most resembled most couples in America. It just got to a point after so many years when [...] really wanted to explore the things that made this relationship work by first pulling it apart." [...] Both actors expressed their desire for the couple to reunite by the series' end. Charles Mesure made his debut as new neighbor Ben Faulkner, a self-made contractor and Renee's new love interest. According to Vanessa Williams, [...] "She’s working hard to make it happen and it’s not happening easily for her. And she’s not <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> and that’s where the comedy ensues and it gives her something to pursue." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite its success, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{had some}} detractors, {{including}} hip hop tastemakers who were unaccustomed to the album's style. At the 1995 Source Awards, OutKast {{won in the}} [...] "Best Newcomer" [...] category, but were booed upon taking the stage and delivering their acceptance speech; Big Boi managed to deliver his shout outs, while André 3000 was nervous and only said, [...] "The South got somethin' to say." [...] The latter recalled how the album was received by some listeners, [...] "People thought that the South basically only had bass music. At first people were looking at us like 'Um, I don't know.'" [...] Hip hop magnate Russell Simmons reacted negatively to the album at the time, but later expressed regret and said of the album in retrospect, [...] "At the time, I didn't understand their music—it sounds so different from what I was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> I foolishly... claim that they 'weren't hip-hop.' The same way people didn't understand 'Sucker MCs' a decade earlier, I didn't understand that instead of operating outside of hip-hop, OutKast was actually expanding hip-hop. They were offering {{one of the most}} honest expressions, and expression so honest that it went completely over my head at first." ...|$|E

Guinness was quoted as saying that the royalties he obtained from working on the films gave him [...] "no complaints; let me leave it by saying I can live {{for the rest of my}} life in the reasonably modest way I am now <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> <b>that</b> I have no debts and I can afford to refuse work that doesn't appeal to me."
