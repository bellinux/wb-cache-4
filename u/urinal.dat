5|$|The {{first task}} is to polish Howard's belt buckles. Howard tends to stand {{too close to the}} <b>urinal</b> and urine often {{splashes}} back onto the buckles. Sheldon is given a black light and several dozen belt buckles to clean. Sheldon performs the task flawlessly. For his second task, Sheldon is forced to wear a French maid costume that Howard originally bought for his girlfriend Bernadette (Melissa Rauch). Sheldon is seen in the cafeteria at Caltech with everyone staring at him.|$|E
5|$|Two visiting Wasco County commissioners were {{poisoned}} {{with glasses}} of water containing Salmonella bacteria {{during a visit to}} Rajneeshpuram on August 29, 1984. Both men fell ill and one was hospitalized. Afterward, members of Sheela's team spread Salmonella on produce in grocery stores and on doorknobs and <b>urinal</b> handles in the county courthouse, but this did not produce the desired effects. In September and October 1984, they contaminated the salad bars of 10 local restaurants with Salmonella, infecting 751people. Forty-five people received hospital treatment; all survived.|$|E
25|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the <b>urinal</b> in bottle form that is used in healthcare, a <b>urinal</b> is a specialized toilet for urinating only, generally by men and boys. It is wall-mounted, with drainage and automatic or manual flushing. The <b>urinal</b> was patented by Andrew Rankin on March 27, 1866.|$|E
25|$|Most {{waterless}} <b>urinals</b> do {{not prevent}} odorous staining {{on the surface}} of the <b>urinals,</b> and periodic cleaning of the fixture and its surrounds is still required. When maintained according to manufacturers' recommendations, well-designed waterless <b>urinals</b> do not emit any more odors than flushed <b>urinals</b> do. However, some odor-trapping devices work better than others in the longer term. Regular, thorough maintenance of the respective odor control device is needed for all types of waterless <b>urinals,</b> as per the manufacturer's recommendation.|$|R
25|$|Since {{about the}} 1990s <b>urinals</b> are {{available}} on the market that use no water at all. These are called waterless <b>urinals</b> or flushless <b>urinals.</b> They were first invented by a German named Klaus Reichardt, who secured his innovation with several patents.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Urinals</b> in Japan {{are very}} similar to the <b>urinals</b> {{in the rest of the}} world, and mainly used for public male toilets or male toilets with a large number of users. They often are, however, mounted lower {{compared}} to <b>urinals</b> in the West.|$|R
25|$|Police in Nassau County, New York adopted talking urinals in an anti-drunk driving initiative. Using Wizmark, {{a talking}} <b>urinal</b> display screen, police can provide bars with free pre-programmed <b>urinal</b> {{messages}} urging patrons not {{to drink and}} drive.|$|E
25|$|Gabriel Chevallier's 1934 satirical novel Clochemerle {{deals with}} the ramifications of plans to install a new <b>urinal</b> in a French village.|$|E
25|$|Waterfree urinals {{have been}} {{installed}} in restrooms throughout campus. These units {{are estimated to}} conserve an average of 40,000 gallons of water per <b>urinal</b> per year.|$|E
50|$|<b>Urinals</b> usually contain {{measuring}} lines providing easy measurement. <b>Urinals</b> {{are also}} useful for measuring urine from other sources.|$|R
25|$|Waterless <b>urinals</b> can be {{installed}} in high-traffic facilities, and in situations where providing a water supply may be difficult or where water conservation is desired. Due to high-level water restrictions, Brisbane, Australia, has mandated conversion to waterless <b>urinals,</b> and flush <b>urinals</b> are rarely seen there.|$|R
25|$|Plumbers' unions {{initially}} opposed waterless <b>urinals,</b> citing {{concerns about}} health and safety, {{which have been}} debunked by scientists who have studied the devices. Facing opposition to their attempts to have the devices allowed in plumbing codes, manufacturers devised a compromise. The Uniform Plumbing Code was modified to allow waterless <b>urinals</b> to be installed, provided that unneeded water lines were nevertheless run {{to the back of}} the <b>urinals.</b> This allows conventional water-flushing <b>urinals</b> to be retrofitted later, if waterless models were judged to be unsatisfactory over time.|$|R
25|$|Composting toilets {{usually do}} not divert urine. Offering a {{waterless}} <b>urinal</b> {{in addition to the}} toilet can help keep excess amounts of urine out of the composting chamber.|$|E
25|$|A {{flush toilet}} is {{different}} from a <b>urinal,</b> {{which is designed to}} handle only liquid waste; or from a bidet, which can be used for personal cleansing after toilet use.|$|E
25|$|Ernest Hemingway {{converted}} a <b>urinal</b> from Sloppy Joe's bar into a {{water fountain}} for his cats. The fountain remains a prominent feature at his former home in Key West, Florida, a popular tourist destination in the town.|$|E
500|$|As the {{building}} was under construction, in March 2006, Liberty Property Trust ran into trouble with Philadelphia's Plumbers Union Local 690, which had issues with {{the building}}'s waterless <b>urinals.</b> The waterless <b>urinals</b> {{were part of the}} plan to make the Comcast Center an environmentally friendly building because they would save an extra [...] of water a year. The plumbers union opposed the waterless <b>urinals,</b> claiming they were unsanitary and would provide less work for the plumbers. Philadelphia's Plumbing Advisory Board approved the waterless <b>urinals</b> on April 5 after a compromise, which stated that the building's owners and city officials would monitor the performance of the waterless <b>urinals,</b> was reached. Piping that would allow water to flow to the <b>urinals</b> in case they needed to be converted was installed in the Comcast Center, which Liberty Property Trust says was always part of the building's plan.|$|R
5000|$|Urine {{diversion}} toilet designs generally require men to sit or squat while urinating {{in order}} to avoid unhygienic splashing of urine. In cultures where men prefer to stand for urination, <b>urinals</b> are a good complementary solution. <b>Urinals</b> - widely used by men at public toilets, restaurants, schools, etc. - work as urine diversion devices because urine is collected separately from feces. When <b>urinals</b> do not use water for flushing (called [...] "waterless urinals"), they can collect the urine pure, meaning without dilution with water. Suppliers for waterless <b>urinals</b> can easily be found on the internet.|$|R
25|$|It is {{socially}} more accepted and more environmentally hygienic {{for those who}} are able, to urinate in a toilet. Public toilets may have <b>urinals,</b> usually for males, although female <b>urinals</b> exist, designed to be used in various ways.|$|R
25|$|Waterless urinals {{may also}} use an outlet system that traps the odor, {{preventing}} the smell often present in toilet blocks. Another method to eliminate odor {{was introduced by}} Caroma, which installed a deodorizing block in their waterless <b>urinal</b> that was activated during use.|$|E
25|$|Rhonda Roland Shearer in {{the online}} journal Tout-Fait (2000) has {{concluded}} that the photograph is a composite of different photos, while other scholars such as William Camfield {{have never been able}} to match the <b>urinal</b> shown in the photo to any urinals found in the catalogues of the time period.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{automatic}} flushes {{solve the}} problems of previous approaches, and are common in new installations. A passive infrared sensor identifies when the <b>urinal</b> has been used, by detecting when someone has stood in front of it and moved away, and then activates the flush. There usually is also a small override button, to allow optional manual flushing.|$|E
2500|$|The body posture {{for users}} of <b>urinals</b> {{is usually the}} {{standing}} position, except for <b>urinals</b> intended for females which {{may be used in}} more of a [...] "hovering" [...] position (partial squat), or even a full squatting position.|$|R

25|$|Often, {{one or two}} of the urinals, {{typically}} at one end of a long row, will {{be mounted}} lower than the others; they are meant for the disabled and other users who cannot reach the regular urinals. In facilities where people of various heights are present, such as schools, urinals that extend down to floor level may be used to allow anyone of any height to use any <b>urinal.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{artist is}} a not great creator—Duchamp went {{shopping}} at a plumbing store. The artwork {{is not a}} special object—it was mass-produced in a factory. The experience of art is not exciting and ennobling—at best it is puzzling and mostly leaves one {{with a sense of}} distaste. But over and above that, Duchamp did not select just any ready-made object to display. In selecting the <b>urinal,</b> his message was clear: Art is something you piss on.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} example of Duchamp's association with Dada was his submission of Fountain, a <b>urinal,</b> to the Society of Independent Artists exhibit in 1917. Artworks in the Independent Artists shows were not selected by jury, and all pieces submitted were displayed. However, the show committee insisted that Fountain was not art, and rejected {{it from the}} show. This caused an uproar amongst the Dadaists, and led Duchamp to resign from {{the board of the}} Independent Artists.|$|E
25|$|In some localities, <b>urinals</b> may {{be located}} on public {{sidewalks}} or in public {{areas such as}} parks. These <b>urinals</b> are often equipped with partitions {{for the sake of}} privacy. They {{may or may not be}} equipped with water flushing mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, {{the band}} {{reformed}} as the <b>Urinals,</b> releasing a CD of new material in 2003. They later took the name Chairs of Perception (a reference to Aldous Huxley's The Doors of Perception) before again becoming the <b>Urinals</b> in 2008.|$|R
25|$|In the Philippines, Marikina was {{the first}} city to install street <b>urinals</b> in the late 1990s. When Marikina Mayor Bayani Fernando was {{appointed}} chair of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, he installed street <b>urinals</b> {{in the rest of}} Metro Manila as well.|$|R
25|$|The station {{buildings}} at Trawsfynydd {{were on the}} Down (northbound) side and provided a ticket office, waiting room, a lavatory and a <b>urinal</b> as well as rooms for staff use and a substantial signalbox on the platform. The Up platform had a waiting room. A goods shed backed onto the engine shed. The site was dominated by a very large water tank {{on top of the}} embankment on the Up side. Both platforms carried a water crane.|$|E
25|$|Several other designs {{have been}} tried since then, but they {{required}} the user either to hover awkwardly or to bring her genitals into close contact with the fixture. Most have not caught on. Current clothes fashions, such as panty hose and slacks, inhibit women from using them {{because they do not}} want their garments to touch the <b>urinal</b> or the floor. Often, women have little experience with urinals and do not know whether to approach them forward or backward.|$|E
25|$|For {{commercial}} divers {{or technical}} divers who may spend many {{hours in a}} dry suit underwater, it is not practical to have to climb back on board the ship in order to open a waterproof relief zipper and urinate. The P-valve is a <b>urinal</b> built into the suit, which enables a diver to urinate at any time without having {{to get out of}} the water, while keeping him or her dry and clean inside the suit.|$|E
25|$|Waterless <b>urinals</b> {{have become}} rather common in Germany since about 2009 {{and can be}} found at restaurants, cinemas, highway rest stops, train {{stations}} and so forth. Waterless <b>urinals</b> can be integrated into ecological sanitation approaches where the collected urine—after storage—can be used in agriculture as a fertilizer.|$|R
