Robert O’Neill, who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot bin Laden, rolled through the door and confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E
5|$|After 1:00pm on 30 April 1945, Braun and Hitler {{said their}} farewells to staff {{and members of}} the inner circle. Later that afternoon, at {{approximately}} 3:30pm, several people reported hearing a loud gunshot. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, and Hitler's SS adjutant, Otto Günsche, entered the small study and found the lifeless bodies of Hitler and Braun on a small sofa. Braun had bitten into a cyanide capsule, and Hitler had shot himself in the right temple with his pistol. The corpses were carried <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> through the bunker's emergency exit to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were burned. Braun was 33 years old when she died.|$|E
5|$|At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda {{left the}} bunker {{and walked up}} to the garden of the Chancellery, where they {{committed}} suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot Magda and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into his body, which did not move.|$|E

5|$|The car speeds {{over the}} French {{countryside}} {{and into the}} Alps, leaping between mountains and knocking over a postman as it goes. At the gates of Dijon, town officials {{try to stop the}} car to enforce the octroi tax, but the car keeps its course and runs headlong into one of the officials, who explodes in his turn. The car wends its way across the Mediterranean coast, overturning a fruit stand, crashing through a greenhouse, colliding with a tar wagon (with another explosion ensuing), and, finally, arriving at the grandstand of spectators awaiting them at Monte Carlo. The car is now going at such speed that, rather than stopping in front of the grandstand, it somersaults <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> crashes to earth. The King and chauffeur, unharmed by their adventurous race, are greeted warmly.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey {{insists on}} {{returning}} to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to immediately send the police there, including her father. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband, who is dead from a gunshot {{to the head}} and identifiable by his missing ear, {{as well as the}} Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound, leaving him barely conscious and unresponsive but still standing. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, knocking over the dead Yellow Man, who had still been standing up, and when he opens the closet door, Jeffrey fatally shoots him in the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town. Dorothy and her son are reunited.|$|E

The song contains the lines [...] "Well we went <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> {{we put out}} the light, Sure {{in less than five}} minutes, I had to show fight.

500|$|At around 16:15, Linge ordered SS-Untersturmführer Heinz Krüger and SS-Oberscharführer Werner Schwiedel {{to roll up}} the rug in Hitler's {{study to}} burn it. Schwiedel later stated that upon {{entering}} the study, he saw {{a pool of blood}} the size of a [...] "large dinner plate" [...] by the arm-rest of the sofa. Noticing a spent cartridge case, he bent down and picked it up from where it lay on the rug about 1mm from a 7.65 pistol. The two men removed the blood-stained rug, carried it <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> outside to the Chancellery garden. There the rug was placed on the ground and burned.|$|E
500|$|Afterwards, Goebbels and {{his wife}} went {{up the stairs to}} ground level and through the Führerbunker's {{emergency}} exit to the bombed-out garden behind the Reich Chancellery.

500|$|She {{had just}} taken on a steady job working for Marianne Faithfull and John Dunbar as the nanny to their little boy Nicholas, and it was while taking care of Nicholas in Marianne’s third floor Chelsea flat that she first {{encountered}} Paul McCartney. He buzzed the intercom to ask if John (Dunbar) was around, and when Paul explained who he was, Maggie invited him straight up. “Paul ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> came in. Very casually I told him that John wasn’t really in and that sent us both into hysterics. We were laughing and chatting. I made a nice lunch for Marianne {{and a bunch of}} her friends but they never showed up. Paul and I sat together and ate it instead. I’ll never forget the meal – it was chicken casserole. It was such a funny introduction that it threw us both off guard. It could have been very embarrassing, but there was an immediate rapport and we just couldn’t stop talking.” ...|$|E

500|$|At the Palmer home, Leland {{smiles at}} himself in the mirror. BOB stares back at him from the {{reflection}} and cackles madly. Leland dons a pair of latex gloves.

She screams in terror and attempts to flee. Leland chases Maddy <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> drags her to the living room. He strangles and punches her, then taunts and chases her around the living room. He corners her and punches her in the face until she is catatonic.

Leland / BOB then becomes enraged and screams, [...] "Leland says you're going back to Missoula, MONTANA!"

[...] Then, on December 1, 2007, Donaire made the first defense of his IBF title against Luis Maldonado of Mexico by a technical knockout in the eighth round. Donaire said, [...] "I guess my validation was today but I didn't feel my best; I felt sluggish. I didn't have my legs. I don't know what the problem was.
