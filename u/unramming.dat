40|$|Upland rice {{plays an}} {{important}} role in supporting food security for community in dryland areas. Genotype × environment interaction is an important factor to be considered in the development of upland rice in Indonesia, because they affect rice yield stability. Genotype × environment interaction and yield stability of rice genotypes are important information to be considered for the development of upland rice. The study was conducted over two years on a dry land area of Banjarnegara, Central Java, using 10 genotypes of upland rice (<b>UNRAM</b> 1 E, 4 E <b>UNRAM,</b> <b>UNRAM</b> 17 E, 9 E <b>UNRAM,</b> Unsoed G 10, G 19 Unsoed, Unsoed G 39, G 136 Unsoed, B 12644 F-MR- 2, B 12498 C-MR- 1) and two varieties (Situ Patenggang and Way Rarem) as control. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance. Results showed that planting time affect yield and yield components of the upland rice tested. Effect of the genotype x planting time interaction was shown on plant height, flowering date, harvest age, and crop yields. The upland rice genotypes that showed a stable high yields over years of planting were <b>UNRAM</b> 4, Unsoed G 10, G 136 Unsoed, B 12644 F-MR- 2, and Situ Patenggang and Way Rarem...|$|R
40|$|To {{search for}} genetic {{resources}} of high grain protein content in upland rice, the variability and genotype × location interaction ofthe protein content was studied by a field experiment. The materials used were 10 improved genotypes and two reference uplandrice cultivars. The experiment {{was carried out}} at seven different locations in rainy season of 2008 / 2009. Genetic variability forgrain protein content among the genotypes was confirmed {{which leads to the}} possibility for breeding of high grain proteincontent in upland rice. Genotype × location interaction influenced grain protein content of upland rice indicating that thegenotypes gave different responses to the variation of locations. The genotypes namely <b>UNRAM</b> 4 E, <b>UNRAM</b> 9 E, <b>UNRAM</b> 17 Ewere found to be the high protein content resources. These three genotypes, with stable protein content across locations, may beconsidered as genetic material for further development of high protein content upland rice cultivar. This finding might be veryuseful to improve nutritional status of poor people in the rural areas especially in east Indonesia (Lombok, Sumbawa) andsemiarid areas with low rainfall...|$|R

The founding {{began with the}} formation of the Preparatory Committee for the Establishment of the State University of Mataram by PTIP Decree number 89/62 dated June 26, 1962. The committee was chaired by the Head of the Provincial Governor of NTB.|$|R
40|$|To {{assure the}} quality of {{education}} in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, we need to design an integrated performance measurement system. For that purpose, we used the IPMS (Integrated Performance Measurement Systems) method. Using the IPMS method, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the Department of Mechanical Engineering were determined by pursuant to stakeholder requirement through four steps. Those are identifying the stakeholder requirement, external monitor, stipulating objectives, and identification of KPIs. Performance measurement system with the IPMS method in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Mataram University can be identified into 38 KPIs grouped in 9 criterias of performance of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, that are curriculum, student, financial, human resources, administration academic, teaching and learning, alumnus, evaluation and operation, and external party. Abstract in Bahasa Indonesia : Untuk menjamin kualitas pendidikan di Jurusan Teknik Mesin, diperlukan sebuah rancangan sistem pengukuran kinerja (SPK) yang terintegrasi dengan metode IPMS (Integrated Performance Measurement Systems). Dengan metode IPMS, Key Performance Indicators (KPI) Jurusan Teknik Mesin ditentukan berdasarkan stakeholder requirement melalui empat tahapan yaitu; identifikasi stakeholder requirement, external monitor, penetapan objectives, dan identifikasi KPIs. Hasil perancangan SPK di Jurusan Teknik Mesin Universitas Mataram, dapat mengidentifikasi 38 KPIs yang dikelompokkan dalam 9 kriteria kinerja Jurusan Teknik Mesin, yaitu; kurikulum, mahasiswa, finansial, SDM, administrasi akademik, proses pembelajaran, alumni, evaluasi dan pengendalian, dan external party.
