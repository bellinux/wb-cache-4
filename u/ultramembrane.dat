40|$|Pancreatic {{cancer is}} the most lethal of all the common malignancies. Markers for early {{detection}} of this disease are urgently needed. Here, we optimized and applied a proteome analysis of human pancreatic juice to identify biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic juice samples, devoid of blood or bile contamination, were collected from patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 5), benign pancreatic diseases (n = 6), or cholelithiasis (n = 3) during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). After <b>ultramembrane</b> centrifugation sample preparation, pancreatic juice proteins were separated by 2 -DE and identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. A 2 -DE dataset of pancreatic juice from patients with cholelithiasis was established, consisting of 76 protein spots representing 22 different proteins. Disease-associated obstruction of the pancreatic duct strongly effected the protein composition of pancreatic juice. Concurrently, pancreatic juice from patients with pancreatic cancer was compared to nonmalignant controls with comparable obstruction of pancreatic ducts. Seven protein spots were identified that consistently appeared at changed levels in pancreatic juice from patients with pancreatic cancer. In conclusion, comparative proteomic analysis of human pancreatic juice {{can be used to}} identify biomarkers of pancreatic cancer...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} fatty acyl-CoA binding {{activity}} of rat liver peroxisomes. After subcellular fractionation of rat liver treated {{with or without}} clofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator, the binding activity with [l-uC]palmitoyl-CoA was detected in the light mitochondrial fraction {{in addition to the}} mitochondrial and cytosol fractions. After Nycodenz centrifu-gation of the light mitochondrial fraction, the binding activity was detected in perox-isomes. The peroxisomal activity depended on the incubation temperature and peroxisome concentration. The activity also depended on the concentration of 2 -mercap-toethanol, and a plateau of activity was unexpectedly found at 2 -mercaptoethanol con-centrations from 20 to 40 mM. Clofibrate increased the total and specific activity of the fatty acyl-CoA binding of peroxisomes by 7. 9 and 2. 5 times compared with the control, respectively. In the presence of 20 % glycerol at 0 'C, approximately 90 % of the binding activity was maintained for up to at least 3 wk. After successive treatment with an <b>ultramembrane</b> Amicon YM series, about 70 % of the binding activity was detected in the M. W. 30, 000 - 100, 000 fraction. When the M. W. 30, 000 - 100, 000 fraction was added to the incubation mixture of the peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA p-oxidation system, a slight in...|$|E
40|$|Human {{pulmonary}} macrophages (PM) {{obtained from}} surgically removed human lung tissue released a factor after exposure to activated zymosan that caused cultured human airways to release increased amounts of radiolabeled mucous glycoproteins. The factor was released maximally after 4 - 8 h of zymosan exposure and caused a dose-related increase in glycoprotein release; it was termed macrophage-derived mucus secretagogue (MMS). MMS release {{was produced in}} a dose-dependent fashion by activated but not by nonactivated zymosan. The activation of zymosan was C 3 dependent, and C 3 b-coated Sepharose was also an effective stimulant. The data suggested that cell surface activation of the PM was a sufficient stimulus to cause MMS release and that both C 3 - dependent activation as well as Fc receptor activation were effective. The synthesis of MMS was sensitive to cycloheximide, and no active MMS was detectable intracellularly. To determine if MMS {{might be one of}} the oxidative derivatives of arachidonic acid, PM were incubated with cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors before activation. These maneuvers did not influence MMS generation. MMS-rich supernatants were then extracted into organic solvents or exposed to lipophilic resin; in both cases, MMS remained in the aqueous phase. Thus, MMS is not a derivative of arachidonic acid. Sequential fractionation of MMS on <b>ultramembrane</b> and gel filtration followed by isoelectric focusing and gel filtration indicated that MMS is a small (approximately 2000 daltons), acidic (pI, 5. 15) molecule. Therefore, surface activation of human PM results in the synthesis and release of a small acidic molecule that causes airway mucous glands to secrete increased quantities of mucous glycoproteins...|$|E
40|$|Animals {{or human}} {{recovered}} from Sarcoptes scabiei infestation acquired protective immunity against reinfestation. The protective immunity {{is considered to}} be associated with a type- 1 -hypersensitivity reaction against allergens instigated by the mites during infestation. It is assumed that these allergens have the potential to be used as the main component of an anti-scabies vaccine. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify and characterise the sarcoptic allergens. For this purpose, 645 mg of mites, collected from mangy goats, were homogenised in PBS to prepare soluble mite proteins. Fractionation of proteins was initially performed on a Q-sepharose column but the results were unsatisfactory. Consequently, SDS PAGE was used as an alternative. Proteins from the gel were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was cut into strips so each strip contained proteins with molecular weights of ³ 90, 80 - 90, 70 - 80, 60 - 70, 50 - 60, 40 - 50, 30 - 40, 25 - 30, 20 - 25, 15 - 20 and 10 - 15 kDa, respectively. The heat stability of the allergens was determined by heating the suspension at 60 ºC for 60 minutes, whereas their dialysability was evaluated using a 10 -kDa-cut-off <b>ultramembrane.</b> The activity of the allergens was assayed by an intradermal test on sensitised goats. This study showed that mite protein extract was very potent allergens since mite extract containing as little as 1 ng mite proteins still caused an obvious hypersensitive reaction. The mite extract contained heat-stable, dialysable and non-dialysable allergens. All fractions recovered from a Q-sepharose column contained allergens with almost equal potency. Fractionation with the SDS-PAGE revealed that the allergens had molecular weights of 35 and < 10 kDa. The former allergen is assumed to be a member of group 10 allergens, whereas the later belong to haptenic allergens...|$|E
