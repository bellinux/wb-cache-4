40|$|That {{displaying}} <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> leads {{consumers to}} choose lower <b>unit</b> <b>priced</b> product options is well established. However, whether this effect occurs persistently across purchase conditions is unclear, and if so, why? This paper proposes {{that the presence}} of <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> increases the salience of price in decision making, making consumers more price-sensitive, which in turn activates a greater motivation to select cheaper products. Findings from three experiments show that this motivational effect persists even when <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> offer little cognitive benefit, such as when product options have identical sizes. Results also show that the motivational effect of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> operates independently of the cognitive effect, and that an individual's price consciousness moderates the motivational effect. The paper demonstrates that <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> increases consumer price sensitivity in the context of price discounts, extending the generalizability of the <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> effect. 13 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|The {{benefits}} of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> {{have been widely}} reported in the literature.

Accordingly, the time spent determining the most economic purchase is condensed substantially, errors in product price comparisons are significantly reduced, and importantly, lower grocery shopping expenditure is attained.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the factors that influence the use and understanding of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing.</b> Furthermore, a comparison between a city with a mandated <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> program (Seattle, Washington) and a city with a voluntary <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> program (Portland, Oregon) was made. The intent was to see if there was more use or understanding of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> in a mandated city. The relationship between the preference for a certain brand and use of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> was also investigated. Weighted indexes were constructed for use in the computation of individual scores. This researcher cross-classified the variables of sex, income level, level of education, age, and store location with the variables of use scores and understanding scores on a measure of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing.</b> One hundred and twenty consumers (60 in Seattle and 60 in Portland) were interviewed in twelve selected stores.

Once the price of petrol rose above £1 per gallon, the industry requested that they be permitted to sell fuel by the litre rather than the gallon, enabling them to reduce the <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> by a factor of about 4.5 and so to extend the lives of existing pumps.|$|E
