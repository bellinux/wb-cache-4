50|$|<b>A</b> {{headstock}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rail <b>vehicle</b> is <b>a</b> transverse {{structural member}} {{located at the}} extreme end <b>of</b> the vehicle's <b>underframe.</b> The headstock supports the coupling at that end of the vehicle, and may also support buffers, in which case {{it may also be}} known as a buffer beam. The headstocks form part <b>of</b> the <b>underframe</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> locomotive or a railroad car. The headstocks of locomotives, railcars and cabcars also support headlamps and the hoses for air brakes, vacuum brakes as well as the cables for train control and head end power.|$|R

30|$|In modern railway operations, {{lightweight}} car {{bodies are}} vital to improving average train speeds. However, lowering the carbody weight reduces the stiffness of the structure, and increases accelerations within the vehicle system. This may {{have a negative impact}} on ride comfort [1, 2]. To handle these problems, <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> solutions have been proposed. For example, an essentially nonlinear vibration absorber was shown to mitigate the large acceleration transmitted to the passenger compartment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> and improve ride comfort [3], and a dynamic vibration absorber was installed in the <b>underframe</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high-speed passenger car to suppress vibration [4]. To reduce bending vibration, some authors have suggested the use of piezoelectric elements shunted by an external electric circuit or active damping via <b>a</b> piezo stack <b>of</b> actuators [5, 6]. A constraint layer on the carbody was researched in [7], and a heavy additional mass suspended under the center of the carbody has also been considered [8].|$|R
50|$|Locomotive 7201 was a diesel-hydraulic locomotive, with B-B wheel arrangement. Built in the New South Wales Government Railways Water Supply Workshops at Chullora, it {{performed}} {{its first}} light engine trial on 27 August 1965. It {{was built on}} the lengthened <b>underframe</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unused 58 class locomotive tender, but using the bogies from a Standard Goods locomotive turret tender. The cab was similar to that <b>of</b> <b>an</b> X200 class and the livery was similar to a 48 class.|$|R
50|$|The first {{car-carrying wagon}} explcitly {{designed}} by the Victorian Railways for this purpose was constructed in 1958. The wagon was built by recycling the <b>underframe</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scrapped Swing Door type locomotive-hauled carriage, with skeletal truss sides supporting an upper level deck. The frame, constructed in 1902 as part of 1st class passenger carriage 4AA, was recoded 3A in the 1910 recoding then 144B in 1927, when better quality 1st class carriages had been made available. The new wagon had <b>a</b> capacity <b>of</b> three typical vehicles on each deck.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{automotive}} restoration {{is commonly}} {{defined as the}} reconditioning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> [...] "from original condition {{in an effort to}} return it to like-new condition," [...] There are many styles <b>of</b> which <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> can be restored, any of which can be performed at the discretion, desire, or taste <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> owner or restorer.|$|R

30|$|Because <b>a</b> <b>vehicle’s</b> {{trajectory}} is in two-dimensional plane, it {{is complex}} to determine the running distance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> directly. The traffic operations are approximate to be in one dimension. Therefore, the time interval is multiplied by the average speed at time t and t +  1 so as to obtain the running distance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> between the time t and t +  1.|$|R
50|$|In transport, driver {{visibility}} is {{the maximum}} distance {{at which the}} driver <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> can see and identify prominent objects around the vehicle. Visibility is primarily determined by weather conditions (see visibility) and by <b>a</b> <b>vehicle's</b> design. The parts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> that influence visibility include the windshield, the dashboard and the pillars. Good driver visibility is essential to safe road traffic.|$|R
50|$|In outdoor parking lots, GPS {{can be used}} to {{remember}} the location <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> (some apps saves location automatically when turning off the car when a smartphone breaks communication with <b>a</b> <b>vehicle's</b> Bluetooth connection). In indoor parking lots, one option is to record one's Wi-Fi signature (signal strengths observed for several detectable access points) {{to remember}} the location <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Roll rate is {{analogous}} to <b>a</b> <b>vehicle's</b> ride rate, but for actions that include lateral accelerations, causing <b>a</b> <b>vehicle's</b> sprung mass to roll about its roll axis. It is expressed as torque per degree of roll of the vehicle sprung mass. It is influenced by factors including {{but not limited to}} vehicle sprung mass, track width, CG height, spring and damper rates, roll center heights of front and rear, anti-roll bar stiffness and tire pressure/construction. The roll rate <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> can, and usually does, differ front to rear, which allows for the tuning ability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> for transient and steady state handling. The roll rate <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> does not change the total amount of weight transfer on the vehicle, but shifts the speed at which and percentage of weight transferred on a particular axle to another axle through the vehicle chassis. Generally, the higher the roll rate on <b>an</b> axle <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle,</b> the faster and higher percentage the weight transfer on that axle.|$|R
