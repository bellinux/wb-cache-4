5|$|The game draws {{heavily from}} both the plot and {{aesthetic}} elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based <b>upon</b> <b>what</b> was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947. The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option {{to play the game}} in black and white. Various plot elements refer to the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.|$|E

5|$|Another probe {{was made}} {{early on the}} morning of 28 March on the {{positions}} of the Australian 5th Field Battery, whose eight guns were located east of Toko, on {{the west bank of the}} Puriata river from where they could provide defensive fires in support of the 25th Infantry Battalion's main positions on the knoll. Shortly before dawn one of the booby traps that the Australians had set around their perimeter to provide early warning was set off and one of the sentries opened fire <b>upon</b> <b>what</b> he believed to be a Japanese probe. A short time later, a small section of Japanese stumbled into one of the forward positions and fire was exchanged. Later, as a team was sent out to disarm the remaining booby traps, this team was fired upon and sporadic fighting continued until midday.|$|E
5|$|Around the 6th century, Porphyreon or Porphyrea is {{mentioned}} {{in the writings of}} William of Tyre, and while it lies within the area covered by modern Haifa, it was a settlement situated south of Haifa-Sycaminon. Following the Arab conquest in the 7th century, Haifa was used to refer to a site established on Tel Shikmona <b>upon</b> <b>what</b> were already the ruins of Sycaminon (Shiqmona). Haifa (or Haifah) {{is mentioned}} by the mid-11th-century Persian chronicler Nasir Khusraw, and the 12th- and 13th-century Arab chroniclers, Muhammad al-Idrisi and Yaqut al-Hamawi. The Crusaders, who captured Haifa briefly in the 12th century, call it Caiphas, and believe its name related to Cephas, the Aramaic name of Simon Peter. Eusebius is also said to have referred to Hefa as Caiaphas civitas, and Benjamin of Tudela, the 12th-century Jewish traveller and chronicler, is said to have attributed the city's founding to Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest at the time of Jesus.|$|E

Platt added, [...] "I respect Muhly's industry in all its forms, but the Cello Concerto is the type of Muhly piece that I will most look forward to." ...|$|R
