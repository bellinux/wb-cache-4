5|$|At Ælfwald's {{accession}} in 713, Ceolred of Mercia had {{dominion over}} both Lindsey and Essex. Ælfwald's sister Ecgburgh was, possibly, {{the same as}} abbess Egburg at Repton in Derbyshire and Ælfwald's upbringing was <b>undoubtedly</b> Christian in nature.|$|E
5|$|Post-mortem reports {{indicated}} that {{she died of}} a traumatic brain injury, the result of severe blows to the head. The governor of Michoacán said that organized crime was <b>undoubtedly</b> involved. Gorrostieta Salazar was buried alongside her husband José Sánchez Chávez in a tomb at a local cemetery in Tiquicheo, her hometown.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} of MacIntyres in Scotland {{to those in}} Ireland is not entirely clear. Given {{the proximity of the}} two countries and the similarity of their languages, some Scottish MacIntyres <b>undoubtedly</b> settled in Ireland, mainly in Ulster.|$|E
5|$|<b>Undoubtedly</b> the {{extraordinary}} depression which {{has existed for}} the past four years in all branches of business, compelled the great railway lines to make reductions in their expenditures, and thus the numbers of unemployed have been constantly added to.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses in the British {{infantry}} {{recorded as}} many as 12assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was <b>undoubtedly</b> far fewer. Kellermann, recognising the futility of the attacks, tried to reserve the elite carabinier brigade from joining in, but eventually Ney spotted them and insisted on their involvement.|$|E
5|$|Although JNA {{losses were}} <b>undoubtedly</b> substantial, the exact numbers are unclear {{because of a}} lack of {{official}} data. The JNA officially acknowledged 1,279 killed in action, including 177 officers, during the entire war in Croatia. According to Tus, the JNA's Novi Sad corps alone lost 1,300 soldiers during the campaign in eastern Slavonia. He extrapolates from this to estimate that between 6,000 and 8,000 soldiers and volunteers died in eastern Slavonia, with the loss of 600 armoured vehicles and heavy weapons and over 20 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Although Stegosaurus is <b>undoubtedly</b> now {{considered}} to have been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether it could have reared up on its hind legs, using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage. This has been proposed by Bakker and opposed by Carpenter. A study by Mallison (2010) found support a rearing up posture in Kentrosaurus, though not for ability for the tail {{to act as a}} tripod.|$|E
5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also {{jammed the}} {{existing}} subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate. This terminated the Laramide orogeny {{that had been}} uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and triggered the ignimbrite sweep, a wave of large-volume silicic magmatism that swept over much of western North America between 50 and 20 Ma. This <b>undoubtedly</b> affected the enigmatic and controversial Challis Arc (stretching from southeastern British Columbia to the Idaho Batholith, roughly parallel with the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament), but {{the details of this}} are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Facts were {{overwhelmed}} with sound, passion substituted for arithmetic, moral indignation pumped {{up to the}} bursting point. But Mr. Diefenbaker provided the liveliest show of the election... and many listeners <b>undoubtedly</b> failed to notice that he was saying even less than the Prime Minister, though saying it more shrilly and with evangelistic fervour... Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood of protest, the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity, the little guy fighting for his rights.|$|E
5|$|He was <b>undoubtedly</b> {{one of the}} {{greatest}} natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science. A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.|$|E
5|$|Her {{tenure in}} Pola was enlivened by {{a visit from}} the new Emperor Karl I on 15 December 1916 and another by Kaiser Wilhelm on 12 December 1917 during his {{inspection}} of the German submarine base there. The Italians conducted no fewer than eighty air raids on Pola between 1915 and 1917 which <b>undoubtedly</b> kept the crews of her anti-aircraft guns busy.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{anatomical}} drawings {{include many}} {{studies of the}} human skeleton and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it {{in a manner that}} prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. He drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a fetus in utero. The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would <b>undoubtedly</b> have made a major contribution to medical science.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians, doubting that a Persian {{commander}} {{would have}} sabotaged his own invasion, have suggested several other possible scenarios. It is, however, {{impossible to know}} exactly how the Naxians {{became aware of the}} invasion, but <b>undoubtedly</b> they were aware, and began to make preparations. Herodotus tells us that the Naxians had previously had no inkling of the expedition, but that when news arrived they brought everything in from the fields, gathered enough food with which to survive a siege and reinforced their walls.|$|E
5|$|Not all, one suspects, were yielded willingly to Æthelwold's {{grasping}} representatives... Æthelwold obviously {{wanted his}} monasteries to be centres of spiritual power, an aim {{he sought to}} fulfil by making them the home of as many saints as possible. <b>Undoubtedly</b> too he was anxious to remove relics from the guardianship of secular communities to a reformed monastic environment. But ultimately even more vital was the link between cult and territorial possession, focused on the saint's role as protector and spiritual lord of his community.|$|E
5|$|Ragtime was a {{style of}} dance music based around the piano, using syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms; the genre's most {{well-known}} performer and composer was <b>undoubtedly</b> Scott Joplin. Donald Clarke considers ragtime the culmination of coon songs, used first in minstrel shows and then vaudeville, {{and the result of}} the rhythms of minstrelsy percolating into the mainstream; he also suggests that ragtime's distinctive sound may have come from an attempt to imitate the African American banjo using the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|The American team {{dismissed}} the report. In an open response, they proclaimed that the {{input from the}} Soviet team was overrated in the review. In addition, they claimed the Soviet team was able to <b>undoubtedly</b> demonstrate the synthesis of element 105 {{at least a year}} after they did. The Russian and the German teams endorsed the report. The scientists from the former JWP rejected the criticisms from Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of John's see of Caithness in 11891190 was <b>undoubtedly</b> intended to extend Scots {{authority in the}} region. The new bishopric was not uncontroversial and John soon came into conflict with Harald Maddadson and the Bishop of Orkney, Bjarni Kolbeinsson. The conflict, presented as a dispute over the collection of monies for the papacy (a form of Peter's pence), was appealed to Pope Innocent III, who wrote to Bishop Bjarni and the Bishop of Rosemarkie (or Ross) to prevent John from interfering with the collection.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} {{contribution of}} the Morea scientific expedition was in effect its quasi-disinterest in pillage and treasure hunting. Blouet refused to perform excavations that risked damaging the monuments, and banned the mutilation of statues {{with the intent of}} taking a piece separated {{from the rest of the}} statue without regard. It is perhaps for this reason that the three metopes of the temple of Zeus discovered at Olympia were brought back in their entirety. In any case, this willingness to protect the integrity of monuments <b>undoubtedly</b> represented an epistemological progress.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} never carried out, being {{cancelled}} primarily {{out of a}} fear of a negative public reaction, with the potential militarization of space that it would also have signified, and because a moon landing would <b>undoubtedly</b> be a more popular achievement {{in the eyes of}} the American and international public alike. A similar project by the Soviet Union also never came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the gold}} coins were {{certainly}} the most valuable issue, followed by the silver one, the exact relationship between the three issues (gold, silver, and bronze) is not known. The supply of gold was closely controlled by the Aksumite state, as noted by Cosmas Indicopleustes, and other precious metals were <b>undoubtedly</b> also closely controlled, allowing the Aksumite state to ensure the usage of its currency.|$|E
5|$|Uranium, element 92, is the {{heaviest}} {{of the elements}} that occur significantly in nature; heavier elements can only practically be produced by synthesis. The first synthesis of a new element—neptunium, element 93—occurred in 1940 {{by a team of}} scientists in the United States. In the coming years, American scientists <b>undoubtedly</b> synthesized the following elements up to mendelevium, element 101, in 1955. However, starting with element 102, priority of discovery was contested between American and Soviet physicists.|$|E
5|$|We {{believe the}} enemy has <b>undoubtedly</b> {{suffered}} a crushing defeat. We thank Admiral Kinkaid for his intervention yesterday. We thank Lee for his sturdy effort last night. Our own aircraft has been grand in its relentless hammering of the foe. All those efforts are appreciated but our greatest homage goes to Callaghan, Scott and their men who with magnificent courage against seemingly hopeless odds drove back the first hostile attack and {{paved the way}} for the success to follow. To them the men of Cactus lift their battered helmets in deepest admiration.|$|E
5|$|A Night to Remember {{was only}} Lord's second book {{but was a}} huge success, thanks {{in no small part}} to the {{aggressive}} advertising campaign carried out by R & W Holt following its launch in November 1955. The book also <b>undoubtedly</b> benefited from the popularity of the 1953 film Titanic and other coverage of the disaster that was published around the same time. Within two months of its publication, the book had sold 60,000 copies and remained listed as a best-seller for six months. The Ladies' Home Journal and Reader's Digest both published condensed versions and it was selected in June 1956 by the Book of the Month Club. The first paperback edition was published by Bantam Books in October 1956.|$|E
5|$|A narrow quay passes {{under the}} old swivel section of the bridge from Waller's Quay to the marina. A well-worn {{handrail}} offers the pedestrian some protection against a slip into the river. This rail has been known as the Duke's Rail since in 1897 the then Duke of York, later to become George V, paid a state visit to Ireland. The royal party travelled up-river from Portumna on the steamship Countess of Mayo. Disembarking at Waller's Quay, the Duke was received by Lord Rosse, the Lord Lieutenant of King's County. The party had to traverse the narrow quay under the bridge to get to Banagher Railway Station, and <b>undoubtedly</b> made good use of the Duke's Rail. The stretch of the Shannon from Portumna to Banagher was {{known for some time}} after as the Duke of York's Route.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{began in the}} early twentieth century to {{question}} if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type was really the work of Garamond, as the Grecs du Roi <b>undoubtedly</b> were. Doubt was raised by French historian Jean Paillard, but he died in the First World War soon after publishing his conclusions in 1914 and his work remained little-read. ATF's historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the 'Garamond' his company was reviving was really Garamond's work, noting that he had never seen it in a sixteenth-century book. He discussed his concerns with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.|$|E
5|$|After {{the birth}} of their daughter, Edith in 1896, Louema {{revealed}} that the father of both Edith and her older brother, Harvey (1893), was C. W. Post. Though Post offered him financial interest in La Vita Inn and his prospective famous breakfast drink, Postum, provided Beilhart he would stay and work at the Inn. Outraged at his friend's betrayal, Beilhart ordered Post out of his house and left Battle Creek for Ohio. Louema left Jacob and took the children back to her family in Kansas in 1897. This experience <b>undoubtedly</b> had a profound effect upon Beilhart's view of marriage.|$|E
5|$|Although Evans {{had always}} {{suffered}} from bouts of depression, and bitterness towards those he felt did not appreciate his inventions, such sentiments seemed to peak {{in his later}} years. During {{one of his many}} legal battles in 1809, comments from the presiding judge sent Evans into a particular fury in which he dramatically incinerated many schematics and papers regarding his inventions, both prior and future. Evans declared at the time that inventing had led only to heartache, disappointment and under-appreciation; and committed himself to business and material acquisition {{for the sake of his}} family. Ultimately what was burned represents only a small proportion of what survives from Evans, and he did continue his interest in inventing, but the tone of Evans's later life was <b>undoubtedly</b> one of hostility and disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Cairano was <b>undoubtedly</b> {{affected}} by this period of sudden and profound decay, if {{only because of the}} sharp decline in commissions. After a decade of intense activity with several overlapping projects, a new stage in his career began, one which is obscured from the documentary view. The last relevant document in this regard is the contract for the entrance to the Duomo of Chiari in 1513, while the next document, in 1517, states that Cairano was already dead. Apart from this, there are other works from the period attributed to him, including the complex question of the completion of the Martinengo mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|Coenwulf's early reign {{was marked}} by a {{breakdown}} in Mercian control in southern England. In East Anglia, King Eadwald minted coins at about this time, implying {{that he was no}} longer subject to Mercia. A charter of 799 seems to show that Wessex and Mercia were estranged for some time before that date, though the charter is not regarded as <b>undoubtedly</b> genuine. In Kent, an uprising began, probably starting after Ecgfrith's death, though {{it has been suggested that}} it began much earlier in the year, before Offa's death. The uprising was led by Eadberht Præn, who had been an exile at Charlemagne's court: Eadberht's cause almost certainly had Carolingian support. Eadberht became king of Kent, and Æthelheard, the archbishop of Canterbury at that time, fled his see; it is likely that Christ Church, Canterbury was sacked.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{uncertainty}} over the clan's origins, Samuel <b>undoubtedly</b> descended from a distinguished family, since an unnamed sister of Stephen I, who had in 1000 or 1001 been crowned the first King of Hungary, {{was given in}} marriage {{to a member of}} the Aba clan around 1009. However, historians still debate whether Samuel himself or Samuel's father married the royal princess. If Samuel was her husband, he must have been born before 990 and converted either from Judaism or paganismto Christianity when he married Stephen I's sister. His Christian credentials are further evidenced by Samuel's establishment of an abbey at Abasár which was recorded by Hungarian chronicles. According to Gyula Kristó and other historians, Samuel's conversion coincided with the creation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Eger encompassing his domains.|$|E
5|$|Director Jewison can put {{his cards}} on the table, let his camera cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a side pocket <b>undoubtedly</b> offers more range. Kid also has a less {{compelling}} subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E
5|$|During the 14th and 15th centuries, a {{large number}} of these works were {{imported}} into northern Europe, and were widely copied by the first generation of Netherlandish artists, among others. The iconography of both the late Byzantine – typified by the unknown artist responsible for the Cambrai Madonna – and 14th-century successors such as Giotto favoured presenting the Madonna on a monumental scale. <b>Undoubtedly</b> van Eyck absorbed these influences, though when and through which works is disputed. It is believed that he had first-hand exposure to them during his visit to Italy, which occurred either in 1426 or 1428, before the Cambrai icon was brought to the North. Van Eyck's two Madonna panels carried forward the habit of reproduction and were themselves frequently copied by commercial workshops throughout the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|In August 1728, Linnaeus {{decided to}} attend Uppsala University {{on the advice}} of Rothman, who {{believed}} it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: Olof Rudbeck the Younger and Lars Roberg. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had <b>undoubtedly</b> been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state. In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, Olof Celsius, who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist. He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, {{which was one of the}} richest botanical libraries in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|In {{approximately}} June 342 BC, Philip {{set off on}} {{what must}} have been a long-planned expedition into Thrace. The campaign was to last for two years, but other than that his forces were large, and that he fought several battles, the ancient sources contain very few details. <b>Undoubtedly</b> Philip's primary aim was to depose Kersebleptes, who according to Diodorus had been causing problems for the Greeks on the Chersonese, once and for all. Philip ended the campaign by marrying Meda of Odessos, daughter of a king of the Getae, which has been taken to suggest that Philip campaigned not just in Thrace, but in the valley of the Hebrus, and north of the Great Balkan range of mountains, near the Danube.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Catholic allegations of rationalism and naturalism, Protestant objections {{are more likely}} to be based on allegations of mysticism, occultism, and even Satanism. Masonic scholar Albert Pike is often quoted (in some cases misquoted) by Protestant anti-Masons as an authority for the position of Masonry on these issues. However, Pike, although <b>undoubtedly</b> learned, was not a spokesman for Freemasonry and was also controversial among Freemasons in general. His writings represented his personal opinion only, and furthermore an opinion grounded in the attitudes and understandings of late 19th century Southern Freemasonry of the USA. Notably, his book carries in the preface a form of disclaimer from his own Grand Lodge. No one voice has ever spoken for the whole of Freemasonry.|$|E
5|$|Most of Caria {{surrendered}} to the Persians in aftermath of Lade, although some strongholds had to be captured through force. The Persian fleet and army wintered at Miletus, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp out the last embers of the revolt. They attacked and captured the islands of Chios, Lesbos and Tenedos and then moved over to the mainland, and captured each of the remaining cities of Ionia. Although the cities of Ionia were <b>undoubtedly</b> harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of Miletus. The Persian army then re-conquered the settlements on the Asian side of the Propontis, while the fleet sailed up the European coast of the Hellespont, taking each settlement in turn. With all of Asia Minor now firmly returned to Persian rule, the revolt was finally over.|$|E
