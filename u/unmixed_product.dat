40|$|A smooth {{algebraic}} surface S {{is said to}} be isogenous to {{a product}} of unmixed type if there exist two smooth curves C, F and a finite group G, acting faithfully on both C and F and freely on their product, so that S=(C × F) /G. In this paper we classify the surfaces of general type with p_g=q= 1 which are isogenous to an <b>unmixed</b> <b>product,</b> assuming that the group G is abelian. It turns out that they belong to four families, that we call surfaces of type I, II, III, IV. The moduli spaces M_I, M_II, M_IV are irreducible, whereas M_III is the disjoint union of two irreducible components. In the last section we start the analysis of the case where G is not abelian, by constructing several examples. Comment: 23 pages. To appear in Communications in Algebr...|$|E

Because Na and K are extremely mobile by solid-state diffusion, cooling gives rise to multiple forms of <b>unmixing</b> <b>products,</b> e.g. various kinds of perthite.

40|$|Broad-scale high-temporal {{frequency}} {{satellite imagery}} is increasingly used for environmental monitoring. While the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) {{is the most}} commonly used index to track changes in vegetation cover, newer spectral mixture approaches aim to quantify sub-pixel fractions of photosynthesizing vegetation, non-photosynthesizing vegetation, and exposed soil. Validation of the <b>unmixing</b> <b>products</b> is essential to enable confident use of the products for management and decision-making. The most frequently used validation method is by field data collection, but this is very time consuming and costly, in particular in remote regions where access is difficult. This study developed and demonstrates an alternative method for quantifying land-cover fractions using high-spatial resolution satellite imagery. The research aimed to evaluate the bare soil fraction in a sub-pixel product, MODIS Fract-G, for the natural arid landscapes of the far west of South Australia. Twenty-two sample regions, of 3400 sampling points each, were investigated across several arid land types in the study area. Albedo thresholds were carefully determined in Advanced Land Observing Satellite Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument Stereo Mapping (ALOS PRISM) images (2. 5 m spatial resolution), which separated predominantly bare soil from predominantly vegetated or covered soil, and created classified images. Correlation analysis was carried out between MODIS Fract-G bare soil fractional cover and ALOS PRISM bare soil proportions for the same areas. Results showed much lower correlations than expected, though limited agreement was found in some specific areas. It is posited that the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fractional cover product, which is based on unmixing using the NDVI and a cellulose absorption index (CAI) proxy, may be generally unable to separate soil from vegetation in situations where both indices are low. In addition, separation is hampered by the lack of ‘pure pixels’ in this heterogeneous landscape. This suggests that the MODIS fractional cover product, at least in its present form, is unsuited to monitor sparsely vegetated arid landscapes. E. F. Lawley, M. M. Lewis, and B. Ostendor...|$|R

"They are {{not exactly}} negroes, {{but one of the}} races known as negritos, having, of course, many negro characteristics, but differing from the African negroes in some {{important}} particulars. To them our supremacy would be an <b>unmixed</b> blessing; their <b>products</b> would reach the coast untaxed, and they would obtain all European goods at vastly cheaper rates. A minor benefit to be obtained by our supremacy is that our sportsmen would certainly speedily diminish the number of wild beasts that at 'present are a scourge to cultivators; the tigers would be killed down, the elephants captured and utilized, and the poor people would not see their plantations ravaged, but would be able to travel through their forests without the constant danger of being carried off by tigers and panthers, and possibly be able to cross their rivers without the risk of being snapped up by alligators; though, doubtless, it would take some time before this would be brought about." ...|$|R
