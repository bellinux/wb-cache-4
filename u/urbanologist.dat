In FINANCING THE METROPOLIS, noted economists and <b>urbanologists</b> team up to examine this ailing patient. They decide, surprisingly, that the outlook is not so hopeless as many believe. Among prognoses: "Local governments are not broke; they just think they are;" and "The current fiscal crisis of our cities is a political problem, not an economic one.

I thought the program was eminently educational, indeed almost a necessary form {{of education in the}} sense that it so vividly and effectively inoculated viewers against accepting propaganda at face value. The program went way beyond the all-too-common hassle over good versus bad propaganda because it was anti-propaganda of any sort: anti-manipulation. - Jane Jacobs, activist, author, <b>urbanologist</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Between 1922 and 1962, Lewis Mumford was America 2 ̆ 7 s most {{important}} and influential architectural critic. While he was a self-described 2 ̆ 2 generalist 2 ̆ 2 whose interests covered a vast intellectual territory, his most lasting distinction has been as an observer of the built environment. Mumford chronicled the birth and adolescence of the modern movement in the United States, exploring its indigenous sources along with contemporary European developments. In Sticks and Stones (1924) and The Brown Decades (1931), he broke new ground {{in the history of}} late-nineteenth-century American architecture. Mumford reached an even broader audience through 2 ̆ 2 The Sky Line 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 The Art Galleries, 2 ̆ 2 columns which he wrote for The New Yorker. He stressed social as well as esthetic concerns in his criticism, believing that the basis of an 2 ̆ 2 organic 2 ̆ 2 American architecture lay not {{in the creation of a}} modern style, but in its adaptation to human need. As the collective focus of civilization, the city occupied a special place in Mumford 2 ̆ 7 s architectural history and criticism. A follower of both Patrick Geddes and Ebenezer Howard, Mumford was the foremost advocate in the United States of garden cities closely integrated with their surrounding regions. This dissertation examines Mumford 2 ̆ 7 s multi-dimensional career as an art and architectural historian, critic, and <b>urbanologist.</b> More than any other intellectual observer, his writings reveal the complexity of architectural thought and practice during this period. ...|$|E
