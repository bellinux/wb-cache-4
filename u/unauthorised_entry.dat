5|$|Scotland's 1937 British Home Championship {{match against}} England {{set a new}} world record for a {{football}} attendance. The Hampden Park crowd was officially recorded as 149,415, though the true figure is unknown as {{a large number of}} additional fans gained <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry.</b> This attendance was surpassed 13 years later by the decisive match of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, but remains a European record.|$|E
5|$|Ten miles (16km) of {{barbed wire}} was used to secure Wembley Stadium against <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry.</b> The pre-match {{entertainment}} was music by the Band of the Irish Guards, and communal singing backed by the band of the Royal Horse Guards. Inclement weather prevented the attendance of King George V. Instead the guest of honour was the Duke of York. Other guests present included Baron Wigram, Admiral Sir Lionel Halsey, Austrian envoy Baron von Franckenstein and the West Indies cricket team.|$|E
5|$|The boy Jones was an {{intruder}} who gained {{entry to the}} palace on three occasions between 1838 and 1841. At least 12 people have managed to gain <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry</b> into the palace or its grounds since 1914, including Michael Fagan, who broke into the palace twice in 1982 and entered the Queen's bedroom on the second occasion. At the time, news media {{reported that he had}} a long conversation with the Queen while she waited for security officers to arrive, but in a 2012 interview with The Independent, Fagan said the Queen ran {{out of the room and}} no conversation took place. It was only in 2007 that trespassing on the palace grounds became a specific criminal offence.|$|E

25|$|Trespass to land is {{any direct}} {{interference}} with {{land in the}} possession of another and is actionable per se. Examples of trespass are <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry</b> to land, placing things on land and inducing animals to enter. Also, continuing trespass, which is actionable from day to day, occurs when there is continuation of presence after permission is withdrawn. The position taken with regards to the elements of trespass is similar in the UK and India.|$|E
25|$|The new barrier {{does not}} cover the gallery {{in front of the}} Strangers' Gallery, which is {{reserved}} for ambassadors, members of the House of Lords, guests of MPs and other dignitaries, and in May 2004 protesters from Fathers 4 Justice attacked Prime Minister Tony Blair with flour bombs from this part, after obtaining admission by bidding for a place in the visitors' gallery in a charity auction. Subsequently, rules on admission to the visitors' galleries were changed, and now individuals wishing to sit in the galleries must first obtain a written pass from a Member certifying that that individual is personally known to them. In September of the same year, five protesters opposed to the proposed ban on fox hunting disrupted the proceedings of the House of Commons by running into the Chamber, the first such occurrence since King Charles I's <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry</b> in 1642, which triggered the English Civil War.|$|E

The trip was organised through the Grimshaw Club - an international relations club affiliated with LSE - by Tomiko Sweeney, the wife of John Sweeney. The North Koreans, who require permission for entry by journalists, and who have jailed journalists who have attempted <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry,</b> were not informed of the BBC team and failed to recognize John Sweeney, calling him [...] "professor." [...] The degree to which the students were informed led to a difference of opinion between the institutions later, with the BBC maintaining that less than full disclosure was a measure taken to protect the students in the event of discovery. Sweeney and his wife were accompanied by a BBC cameraman.|$|E
2500|$|NATO {{published}} {{a statement on}} the war in Donbass and the Crimean Crisis in August 2014. It attempted to debunk the Russian government's accusations against the Ukrainian government, and also other statements made by Russia to justify its presence in Ukraine. According to the statement, Russia attempted to [...] "divert attention away from its actions" [...] and [...] "levelled a series of accusations against NATO which are based on misrepresentations of the facts". It also said that Russia [...] "made baseless attacks on the legitimacy of the Ukrainian authorities and has used force to seize part of Ukraine's territory". In response to the <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry</b> of the Russian humanitarian convoy on 22 August, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen stated that this incident could [...] "only deepen the crisis in the region, which Russia itself has created and has continued to fuel. The disregard of international humanitarian principles raises further questions about whether the true purpose of the aid convoy is to support civilians or to resupply armed separatists". Late in August, NATO generals met and revised their assessment of the military situation in Donbass. They said that, from the Ukrainian government's point of view, the war is already lost. It was anticipated that the late-August offensive in southern Donetsk Oblast could be used to create a Russian land corridor to Crimea, consolidating the illegal annexation of the peninsula. NATO general Philip Breedlove said on 20 September that the ceasefire implemented as part of the Minsk Protocol was [...] "a ceasefire in name only", and criticised Russia for allowing men and equipment to flow freely across its border into Donbass.|$|E

50|$|The {{entrance}} to Drop Redoubt was via a bridge. The inner third {{of this was}} pivoted so that the Redoubt could be isolated. The pivot and the recess into which the bridge swung can still be seen, although the bridge has long since gone. In the 1980s, a temporary scaffolding bridge was built by the army to enable access for guided tours of the Redoubt, but this was removed in the middle 1990s to prevent <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry</b> and vandalism.|$|E
5000|$|There were {{doubts about}} the {{interpretation}} of this Act. It was suggested that the words translated as [...] "that none from henceforth make any entry into lands and tenements, but in case where entry is given by the law" [...] should be construed as making any <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry</b> an offence, even where peaceful. It appears {{that this was not}} the intention of those responsible for the Act, and the courts did not at any time construe it that way.|$|E

50|$|A guardhouse {{stands at}} the end of the bridge over to the island. Built in 1821-1826 in the Neoclassical style, the well-preserved stone {{building}} with a deeply pitched roof is probably the oldest guardhouse in Sweden. It is the only building in the Naval Base which faces towards the town itself. A description from 1781 details the interior as consisting of an entrance hall, a prison cell, a non-commissioned officers' room, a guard room and a room for fire equipment. The guardhouse was used to protect the naval base from <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry.</b>|$|E
50|$|For years, Levant Battery was an {{excluded}} area, where <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry</b> by {{the public}} was considered a criminal offence. While Breakneck Battery is still closed to the public, the other four batteries are now accessible. In the 1970s, Levant Battery was decommissioned. Later, the 9.2-inch gun was removed. In 1981, the gun at Spur Battery was dismantled and transferred to the Imperial War Museum Duxford in Cambridgeshire, England in the military operation referred to as Project Vitello. In 2010, O'Hara's Battery and Lord Airey's Battery were opened to the public.|$|E
50|$|Security {{design in}} the doors is aimed at {{preventing}} the doors both fixed and sliding from being lifted off their rails, anti-lift blocks can be fixed {{to the top of}} the frame to prevent the lift of the door off its rails, so in theory preventing <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry</b> to the room when sliding door is in the closed position. A portable security bar can also be fitted from the inside the room to prevent sliding action when door is closed. The adjustable security bar can also be used for added security when traveling.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, {{the section}} between Ribnitz-Damgarten West and Stralsund was {{completely}} renovated. The {{appearance of the}} stations on the track changed greatly. The signal boxes were replaced by a new electronic interlocking in Velgast. Consequently, all signal boxes that were no longer needed and freight sidings were demolished and the interlocking equipment that was housed in the old station buildings was removed. The remaining buildings are largely empty, and have been secured against <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry.</b> The closed stations were completely demolished {{in the course of}} the renovation. But, after the renovation of the track, a new station was opened in Stralsund Grünhufe.|$|E
50|$|Middle Hill Battery was an {{excluded}} {{area for}} decades, where <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry</b> {{by the public}} was considered a criminal offence. In an agreement signed on 20 April 2004, much of the land at Middle Hill was transferred from the Ministry of Defence to the Government of Gibraltar in April 2005. Ministry of Defence personnel left the Middle Hill area and much of their equipment was removed, although they still retain control over the Rock Gun Battery site, where radio masts persist, further north along Rock Gun Road. The area is now managed by the Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society.|$|E

Despite the transfer of the property to the government, it was {{a year and a half}} before the Government of Gibraltar assumed responsibility for Middle Hill. During that time, there was extensive vandalism. In addition, public safety became an issue, as a number of areas on the site were dangerous. The Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society, which now manages the area, put forth an Upper Rock Management Plan, in which the organisation included recommendations for Middle Hill. The proposal for Middle Hill included the recommendation that it be named a biological reserve with access to the public only on a prearranged basis.|$|E
50|$|The Yugoslav Navy had 10,000 sailors (including 4,400 conscripts and 900 marines). This was {{essentially}} a coastal defence force with the mission of preventing enemy amphibious landings along the country's rugged 4,000-kilometer shoreline and coastal islands, and contesting an enemy blockade or control of the strategic Strait of Otranto. The entire coast of Yugoslavia {{was part of the}} naval region headquartered at Split. The naval region was divided into three smaller naval districts and a riverine flotilla with major naval bases located at Split, Šibenik, Pula, Ploče and Kotor on the Adriatic Sea, and Novi Sad on the River Danube. The strategic islands of Vis and Lastovo were heavily fortified and <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry</b> was prohibited. The fleet was organized into missile, torpedo, and patrol boat brigades, a submarine division, and minesweeper flotillas. The naval order of battle included four frigates, three corvettes, five patrol submarines, fifty-eight missile, torpedo, and patrol boats, and twenty-eight minesweepers. One antisubmarine warfare helicopter squadron was based at Split on the Adriatic coast. It employed Soviet Ka-25, Ka-28, and Mi-14 helicopters, and domestic Partisan helicopters. Some air force fighter and reconnaissance squadrons supported naval operations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{proposed}} {{legislation in the}} Netherlands applies nationally. Earlier, schools and other institutions had enforced their own bans on Islamic dress, although usually not on the Islamic headscarf. Employers also have their own policies. Cases of dismissal or exclusion from school are sometimes handled by the Netherlands Equality Commission, creating de facto national guidelines on what constitutes discrimination. In Amsterdam, school policies attracted media attention after an incident in 2003. A higher vocational college, banned three students for wearing the niqab. One was removed by police {{when she tried to}} enter the school wearing the niqab: the school regulations are legally enforceable because <b>unauthorised</b> <b>entry</b> is trespass. The students appealed to the Equality Commission, which ruled (in March 2003) in favour of the school. The school justified the ban {{on the grounds that the}} niqab [...] "hindered eye contact, which testifies to mutual respect". The Commission agreed with the school, indicating that the educational necessity of contact and communication within the school building overrode the religious-freedom aspects. The education minister, Maria van der Hoeven, of the Christian-Democratic party CDA, publicly approved the Commission decision. The Amsterdam CDA subsequently called for a national ban on chador, burqa and niqab in schools, partly on the grounds that they conflicted with common national values.|$|E
