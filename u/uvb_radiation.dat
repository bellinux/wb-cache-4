Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels.

40|$|A {{new role}} of Phase I and Phase II enzymes in keratinocytes UVB induced apoptosis. UVB {{is the major}} cause for {{cutaneous}} malignancies in the human population. The skin is able to activate anti-oxidants and enzymatic detoxification reactions to neutralize reactive photochemical products. Apoptosis, removing irreversibly DNA-damaged and potentially neoplastic cells, represents a major defence mechanism towards malignant transformation. Very {{little is known about}} the role of cutaneous cytochrome P 450 (CYP 450) isoenzymes and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in UVB response. Although not yet fully investigated, it has been studied a possible relationship between CYP 450 inductors and UVB initiated apoptosis in rat hepatocytes. Altered high levels of GST has been directly correlated to resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs suggesting that GST plays a role in prevention of apoptosis. Our study is focused on phase I and phase II enzyme activities in normal human keratinocytes. In the first part of the study we demonstrated that CYP 450 (1 A 1 and 2 B 1) and GST are induced not only by classical inducers such as β-naphthoflavone, 3 -methylcholanthrene, phenobarbital but also by <b>UVB</b> <b>radiations</b> (50 mJ/cm 2). Differentiated keratinocytes were employed for all the experiments as confirmed by immunoblotting with Cytokeratin 10, a specific marker of the basal spinous transition. In the second part we evaluated a possible involvement of these enzyme in UVB mediated apoptosis process. Western blot analysis of Bcl 2 expression and PARP cleavage showed that inhibition of CYP 450 by Proadifen prevented UVB induced apoptotic cell death. In contrast, the diuretic drug, ethacrinic acid, a GST inhibitor, was able to improve UVB induced apoptosis. In order to confirm the anti-apoptotic activity displayed by GST, when GST activity was increased by Phenobarbital, UVB apoptosis was prevented. These results suggest that <b>UVB</b> <b>radiations</b> may play a critical role as tumour promoters even through the regulation of CYP 450 and GST metabolising enzymes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe extreme {{resiliency}} of lichens to UV radiations {{makes them}} an interesting model {{to find new}} photoprotective agents acting as UV-blockers and antioxidant. In this research, using a new in vitro method designed to overcome the shortage of material associated to many studies dealing with natural products, we show that the three major compounds isolated from the lichen Vulpicida pinastri, vulpinic acid, pinastric acid and usnic acid, were UV blocker agents.

40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} is {{a chronic}} inflammatory skin disease with defects in the epidermal barrier. In {{a cohort of}} African-American children, a FLG 2 nonsense mutation {{has been associated with}} the disease. In the epidermis of European patients, the expression of filaggrin- 2, the filaggrin-related protein encoded by FLG 2, is decreased. To describe the function of filaggrin- 2 and evaluate the impact of its deficiency, its expression was downregulated using lentivirus-mediated shRNA interference in a three-dimensional reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) model. This resulted in parakeratosis and a compact stratum corneum, presence of abnormal vesicles inside the corneocytes, increased pH and reduced amounts of free amino acids at the RHE surface, leading to increased sensitivity to <b>UVB</b> <b>radiations.</b> The expression of differentiation markers was slightly modified.

40|$|Titanium dioxide TiO 2 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and most used materials in the modern era. Because of its properties it is suitable for a large number of applications in several different fields. In the bulk phase, it is primarily used as a white pigment. As nanomaterial, it is a component in dye-sensitized and organic solar cells as well as in food and personal care products. In the last years personal care applications are increasing; for example nano-powdered TiO 2 is extensively employed as physical filter in commercial sunscreens, since it is capable to adsorb and scatter both UVA and <b>UVB</b> <b>radiations</b> and to eliminate the natural opacity typical of microsized sunscreens. However, together with its physical and chemical properties, it is important to assess health implications that the use of TiO 2 powder in the nanometer scale might have in personal care applications. A possible way to reduce health implications, especially when related to the formation of freeradicals, is given by coating and doping of TiO 2 nanoparticles with organic and inorganic additives. Different efficiencies in preventing the release of free radicals can be achieved, depending on the nature of coating and doping. In this work, the formation of pure TiO 2 nanoparticles and carbon-titania nanocomposite by flame synthesis is presented. The procedure is based on the injection of Ti precursor solutions inside hydrocarbon flames with different equivalent ratios. This allows us to synthesize nano-sized particles (1 - 10 nm), with specific crystallinity phase and carbon content. Chemical and physical properties, composition and dimension of flame-synthesized nanoparticles are characterized by Raman spectroscopy, UV-visible light absorption and Atomic Force Microscopy. Analysis of Reactive Oxygen Species in human keratinocytes cellular lines is used to select the operating conditions of the synthesis process leading to the production of TiO 2 -carbon nanopowder with reduced adverse health effect...|$|R

HaCaT cells {{are widely used}} as a primary keratinocyte substitute to study these pathways. However, like most squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), it contains a dysfunctional p 53. It is unclear if HaCaT cells activate these signalling pathways similarly to SCC cells (Colo 16) or to primary human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK). In this study, the UV activation (UVA, UVB, UVA ?

The signalling pathway activation was UV-type and dose-dependent with <b>UVB</b> ? A <b>radiation</b> inducing a high p 38 and JNK activation. HaCaT cells exhibited 2 - to 4 -fold higher activity of the p 38 (771 % at 60 min) and JNK (794 % at 30 min) pathways following <b>UVB</b> ? A <b>radiation</b> than did HEK cells (p 38 : 367 % at 15 min and JNK: 184 % at 30 min). While both HaCaT and Colo 16 cells did not activate the NFjB pathway, Colo 16 cells had a lower p 38 and higher JNK activity than HaCaT cells. Irradiated HaCaT cells produced less TNFa (UVB: 3. 5 pg/ml), while HEK cells produced the most (UVB: 1, 296 pg/ml). When co-exposed to IL 1 a, irradiated HaCaT had the greatest fold of TNFa release (UVB: 16. 2 -fold, UVA ? B: 8. 9 -fold and UVB ? A: 6. 1 -fold). The pattern of activation and TNFa secretion of HaCaT cells mirrored that of Colo 16 cells.

Moreover 1 of 3 persons is likely to develop skin cancer during life span in Queensland. The new habit of Whites to sun-bathe in sunny regions of the world seems to be in close relationship with the increased incidence of malignant melanoma. In addition, the hazard of skin cancer is higher in the south of U. S. A as compared with the north, where the <b>UVB</b> <b>radiations</b> is lower. Genetic factors seem {{to play a role in}} malignant melanoma. Patients having this tumour report sun-burn and freckling in a 4 fold higher frequency than non melanoma patients. Chemicals such as psoralens; used as photosensitizers, synthetic steroids and probably some cosmetics, may act as error prone carcinogenic agents in the presence of hv from UV light. This field of skin toxicology and carcinogenesis leads into to the way of new developments in cosmetics, including the design of efficient skin protectors. Therefore, future efforts in preventing further increase of malignant melanoma incidence should take into account the following: 1) UV irradiation is a causative factor of malignant melanoma; 2) the evidence of genetic propensity at developing malignant melanoma; 3) the increased use of chemicals and cosmetics with a photosensitizing effect - and possibly a photochemical carcinogenic effect - is an additional hazard; 4) the XXth century man will not give up sun-bathing.
