5|$|Highway21 was {{the first}} King's Highway in Lambton County when it was assumed in 1927 between Highway3 at Morpeth and Highway7 at Reece's Corners. This {{original}} section of highway changed from a mudhole to a plank road circa 1860. When James Miller Williams, a Hamilton businessman, set out one day from during a drought to dig a well, he chose a spot downhill from an existing oil seep {{in the village of}} Black Creek. Instead of encountering water, Williams hit a shallow oil deposit. As a result of the ensuing oil-boom, which would begin the petroleum industry in North America, Williams laid out the village and changed its name to Oil Springs. Two competing plank road companies were formed, the Black Creek Plank Road Company (of which Williams was a principal investor) and the Sarnia to Florence Plank Road Company, both of which aimed their roads through Oil Springs. Although both roads were constructed, the former company was more prosperous in its endeavours; in 1886, {{a significant portion of the}} Sarnia to Florence Plank Road was closed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> over to local property owners. The Black Creek Plank Road Company meanwhile had transformed the muddy quagmire of a path into a well-maintained road. By 1863, three miles of road south of Wyoming had been paved, and the remainder south to Oil Springs planked (the Sarnia Road followed two years later). However, as the oil boom faded, so too did improvement to the road.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the Triple Threat {{match for the}} WWE Championship between {{champion}} John Cena, Edge, and Triple H. As the match began, Edge chose to stand outside the ring, hoping that Cena and Triple H would simply fight the match themselves. Cena and Triple H, however, teamed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> against Edge. One spot in the match saw Edge catapult Triple H into the steel ringpost, which made Triple H bleed. Afterwards, Edge executed an Edgecution onto an announce table on Triple H and then focused on Cena. Cena, however, locked Edge in the STFU, but was broken when Triple H hit Cena {{in the head with}} a microphone. Triple H then went after Edge and hit him with a chair, sending him over the security wall and into the audience. Lita, who accompanied Edge, entered the ring with a chair to hit Triple H, but Triple H reversed it into a Spinebuster, a move where the wrestler lifts the opponent, turning 180°, and then tosses her forward onto her back. Near the end of the match, Cena attempted an FU on Edge but Triple H delivered a low blow to Cena, which made Cena drop Edge out of the ring and attempted to execute a Pedigree. Cena, however, countered it into a jackknife roll-up. Cena won the match and successfully retained the WWE Championship. After the match, Triple H hit Cena, Edge, and the referee with a sledgehammer, and performed his signature taunt until performing his signature DX cross chops, receiving a standing ovation from the audience, closing the show.|$|E

25|$|By the 14th century, Eye Castle lay {{largely in}} ruins, {{although}} {{parts of the}} castle continued to be maintained as a prison. Despite the ruined nature of the castle, the local estates previously subject to the castle-guard system continued to return their dues, now converted into monetary rents, to the owners of Eye Castle for many years. A windmill was built {{on top of the}} motte between 1561-2. In the early 17th century, like many other medieval Suffolk parks, the park of Eye around the castle was broken <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> into fields.|$|E
25|$|The 1799 {{campaign}} in Italy {{began with the}} Battle of Verona, a series of costly but indecisive clashes around Verona on 26 March. At the Battle of Magnano on 5 April, the Habsburg Austrian army of Paul Kray triumphed over the Republican French army of Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer. While suffering losses of 4,000 killed and wounded and 2,000 captured, Kray's Austrians inflicted casualties of 3,500 killed and wounded and captured 4,500 men, 18 artillery pieces and seven colors from the French. Two days later, a distraught Schérer begged to be relieved of command. Michael von Melas arrived to take command of the Austrian army from Kray on 9 April. Hearing that 12,000 Austrians were approaching from the Tyrol to the north, Schérer abandoned {{the line of the}} Mincio River on 12 April. Leaving 12,000 troops in the fortress of Mantua and 1,600 more in Peschiera del Garda, the demoralized French commander ordered his crippled army to withdraw. As the soldiers fell back, the skies opened <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> the retreat into a sodden nightmare.|$|E

500|$|Skipper W was a 1945 sorrel {{stallion}} bred by H. J. Wiescamp of Alamosa, Colorado. Sired by Nick Shoemaker, {{whose father}} was Nick sired by Shiek P-11, Skipper W was out of Hired Girl, a daughter of Cowboy P-12. His second dam, or maternal grandmother, was Leche, who was also fathered by Nick by Shiek P-11. The colt was named Skipper W because, as Wiescamp related:I had another good stud colt born {{around the same time}} as Skipper. He was a palomino sired by Gold Mount and out of Slipalong Wiescamp. That was also the year that the good movie, Showboat, came out and I named the little yellow colt after that picture. Anyway, I had Hired Girl up in a corral and, after she foaled, I told a fellow who was working for me to disinfect the naval on the colt [...] After the man did that, the colt got <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> around and kicked him 'cause it smarted. I said to that fellow, [...] "Look at that, he already knows he's the boss! I've got a showboat, and every boat needs a skipper, so that's what I'm going to name him– Skipper." [...] I added the W for Wiescamp.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the damage}} Stella Solaris {{suffered}} in 2001, she was planned {{for yet another}} remodelling and further cruise service. However, in the years following, modern cruise ships began to overtake older ships in popularity. Maintenance costs rose and Stella Solaris {{was taken out of}} service in 2002. Along with hundreds of other relatively old ocean liners, she was sold for scrap around late 2003. She sailed for Alang, Bhavnagar District, India under the delivery name S Solar, arriving on December 8, 2003, alongside another, smaller, Sun Lines ship, [...] Much of the artwork and furnishings from Stella Solaris was auctioned, some materials and fittings were also recovered and sold, while the rest of her hull was broken <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> into scrap metal.|$|E

2500|$|On May 1, 1971, Amtrak {{took over}} {{operation}} of the San Diegan line, which operated its route between Santa Fe Depot and Union Station in Los Angeles. Train transets usually ran with no cabcar {{in the days before}} Amtrak took over the {{operation of the}} San Diegan. To make this work, Santa Fe trains backed <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> the trains around at the Washington Street Wye, just about 3 miles north of the station. The wye is not longer in service today. [...] Amtrak Pacific Surfliner trains have an engine at one end and a cabcar at the other end. Though the San Diegan name was retired on June 1, 2000, after more than sixty years of service, the Pacific Surfliner (which runs between San Diego and San Luis Obispo) still makes multiple daily visits.|$|E
2500|$|At around 10:20, the {{manoeuvring}} of the {{two ships}} brought them to within , and Glossop {{took the opportunity to}} order a torpedo firing. The torpedo failed to cover the distance, and sank without exploding. The Australian ship sped <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> to starboard so guns that had yet to fire could engage. Emden matched Sydneys turn, but by this point, the second funnel had been blasted off, and there was a fire in the engine room. In addition, about half of the cruiser's personnel had been killed or wounded, and the abandoning of the attack party on Direction Island meant there were no reserves to replace them. By 11:00, only one of Emdens guns was still firing. As the third funnel went overboard, Emden found herself closer to North Keeling Island, and von Müller ordered the ship to beach on North Keeling Island, hoping to prevent further loss of life. Emden ran aground at around 11:20, at which point, Sydney ceased fire. After Sydney contacted the convoy to report [...] "Emden beached and done for", the soldiers aboard the troopships were granted a half-day holiday from duties and training to celebrate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{improvements}} at Washington Airport were so {{significant that}} in April 1932 the night airmail flight was transferred from Bolling Field to Washington Airport. A month later, in a continuing {{effort to improve}} safety, the airport paid local electric power and telephone companies to bury their lines obstructing the landing and take-off lanes. The airport had improved so much that legislation was introduced in Congress to authorize the lease of the airfield as a municipal airport. Washington Airport authorities conditioned their acceptance on the payment of $25,000 a year and the closure of Military Road. They also suggested that Hoover Field {{be added to the}} lease. The lease proposal, however, was complicated by the federal government's claim to the Potomac River up to the high-water mark on the Virginia shore. [...] Local small businesses had sold the airport land they claimed to own. [...] But this land had formerly been part of Roaches Run, a creek that emptied into a bay of the same name on the Potomac River. [...] The creek and {{a large portion of the}} bay had silted <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> to dry land after the construction of the Long Bridge in 1903 changed the flow of water, and it was this property which the businesses were built on, and which had been sold to Washington Airport. The Supreme Court's decision in Smoot Sand & Gravel two years earlier did not apply, parties in the dispute said, because the Roaches Run land had been created naturally rather than artificially. But no legislative action was taken, and the government never leased the airport.|$|E
