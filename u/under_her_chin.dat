5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E
25|$|She and her troupe {{departed}} from Le Havre for America on 15 October 1880, arriving in New York on 27 October. On 8 November, she performed Scribe's Adrienne Lecouvreur at Booth's Theater {{before an audience}} which had paid a top price of $40 for a ticket, an enormous sum at the time. Few in the audience understood French, {{but it was not}} necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received a thunderous ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood perfectly still, with her hands clasped <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> or with her palms on her cheeks, and then suddenly stretched them out to the audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theater-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.|$|E
500|$|Anne exerted a {{powerful}} charm {{on those who}} met her, though opinions differed on her attractiveness. The Venetian diarist Marino Sanuto, who saw Anne when Henry VIII met Francis I at Calais in October 1532, described her as [...] "not one of the handsomest women in the world; she is of middling stature, swarthy complexion, long neck, wide mouth, bosom not much raised... eyes, which are black and beautiful". Simon Grynée wrote to Martin Bucer in September 1531 that Anne was [...] "young, good-looking, of a rather dark complexion". Lancelot de Carle called her [...] "beautiful with an elegant figure", and a Venetian in Paris in 1528 also reported that {{she was said to}} be beautiful. The most influential description of Anne, but also the least reliable, was written by the Catholic propagandist and polemicist Nicholas Sanders in 1586, half a century after Anne's death: [...] "Anne Boleyn was rather tall of stature, with black hair, and an oval face of a sallow complexion, as if troubled with jaundice. It is said she had a projecting tooth under the upper lip, and on her right hand six fingers. There was a large wen <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> and therefore to hide its ugliness she wore a high dress covering her throat... She was handsome to look at, with a pretty mouth". Sanders held Anne responsible for Henry VIII's rejection of the Catholic Church, and writing fifty years after her death, was keen to demonise her. Sanders's description contributed to what biographer Eric Ives calls the [...] "monster legend" [...] of Anne Boleyn. Though his details were fictitious, they have formed the basis for references to Anne's appearance even in some modern textbooks.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a brute he was, ugh!" [...] she said, retying {{the ribbons}} of <b>her</b> bonnet <b>under</b> <b>her</b> square <b>chin,</b> and {{smoothing}} out her linen duster.|$|R
60|$|With a rough gesture {{he put his}} clawlike hand <b>under</b> <b>her</b> {{delicate}} <b>chin,</b> forcing <b>her</b> to {{turn round}} and to look at him. She shuddered at the loathsome touch, but her quietude never forsook her for a moment.|$|R
60|$|She {{was very}} pale, very quiet, and very determined. The {{traveling}} mantle thrown {{over her shoulders}} was dusty, the ribbons that tied <b>her</b> hat <b>under</b> <b>her</b> round <b>chin</b> had become unloosed. She advanced, walking down the line of shadow directly towards him.|$|R
2500|$|Marriage à la Mode series {{depicts a}} fashionable young wife wearing a sack-back jacket and stomacher with a {{contrasting}} petticoat. [...] A linen hood or cap is tied <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> 1743–45.|$|E
2500|$|... {{features}} the sheer pointed partlet worn over the gown that was popular in Italy at this time. [...] This woman wears a small cap with a brim {{on the back}} of her head; it ties <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... {{wears the}} frilled indoor day cap of {{a married woman}} with a wide ribbon bow tied <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b> [...] Her simple dark gown has gigot sleeves and a {{modestly}} broad neckline, filled in with a ruffed chemisette.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had on her}} peasant brown skirt. The rest of her was {{concealed}} in a black shawl which covered her head, her shoulders, arms, and elbows completely, down to her waist. The hand holding the candle protruded from that envelope which the other invisible hand clasped together <b>under</b> <b>her</b> very <b>chin.</b> And <b>her</b> face looked like a face in a painting. She said at once: ...|$|R
60|$|Nancy (who has a fine appetite) looked pleased. When {{she looks}} pleased, she looks nice. When she looks nice, I chuck <b>her</b> <b>under</b> the <b>chin.</b> It isn't immorality--it's only habit.|$|R
60|$|She {{jumped from}} the sofa, {{ran out of the}} room, and {{returned}} presently, tying the string of a long striped cotton blouse--evidently an extra one of Sophy's--behind her back as she returned. It was gathered <b>under</b> <b>her</b> oval <b>chin</b> by a tape also tied behind her, while her fair hair was tucked under the usual red bandana handkerchief of the negro housemaid. It is scarcely necessary to add that the effect was bewitching.|$|R
2500|$|Krystal {{was injured}} during Day 62's Friday Night Games, {{and had to}} leave the Friday Night Live arena. [...] She was treated by a doctor in the Spare Room, {{receiving}} nine stitches <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b> She was also unable to compete in the following week's FNL.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the King's best attempts, Caroline {{retained}} a strong popularity amongst the masses, and pressed ahead {{with plans to}} attend the coronation service on 19 July 1821 as queen. Lord Liverpool told Caroline that she should {{not go to the}} service, but she turned up anyway. George had Caroline turned away from the coronation at the doors of Westminster Abbey. Refused entry at both the doors to the East Cloister and the doors to the West Cloister, Caroline attempted to enter via Westminster Hall, where many guests were gathered before the service began. A witness described how the Queen stood at the door fuming as bayonets were held <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> until the Deputy Lord Chamberlain had the doors slammed in her face. Caroline then proceeded back to an entrance near Poets' Corner, where she was met by Sir Robert Inglis, who held the office of [...] "Gold Staff". Inglis persuaded the Queen to return to her carriage, and she left. Caroline lost support through her exhibition at the coronation; the crowds jeered her as she rode away, and even Brougham recorded his distaste at her undignified behaviour.|$|E
60|$|He put his {{forefinger}} <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> {{and lifted}} it. She {{was conscious of}} his restless, demanding eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned to}} go. In his eagerness {{to open the}} door for her, he upset his chair, and with some confusion, that was {{actually}} youthful, he almost impeded her movements in the hall, and knocked his broad-brimmed Panama hat from his bowing hand in a final gallant sweep. Yet as her small, trim, youthful figure, with its simple Leghorn straw hat confined by a blue bow <b>under</b> <b>her</b> round <b>chin,</b> passed away before him, she looked more like a child than ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ellen, shore y'u ain't so daid {{white as}} y'u was," [...] {{observed}} Colter, and he chucked <b>her</b> <b>under</b> the <b>chin</b> with familiar hand. [...] "Set down heah. I don't want y'u stoppin' any bullets. An' there's no tellin'." ...|$|R
60|$|Her hair, {{which is}} quite white, is frizzed out in front, and she wears over it a small cap, nicely plaited, and brought down <b>under</b> the <b>chin.</b> <b>Her</b> manners are simple and primitive, {{heightened}} a little by a proper dignity of station.|$|R
60|$|She held up {{her face}} to him. Her little bright-red lips moved as he fumbled <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll jowl {{your head}} for impudence," [...] said Mrs. Morel, and she tied {{the strings of}} the black bonnet valiantly <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lydie, his wife, was {{kneeling}} beside his bed, her delicate hands clasped <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> her eyes large, glowing and ever grave fixed upon his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{stared at}} me as if I had asked for a feather bed. I thought, maybe, she had not heard, so I {{repeated}} it louder. If I had chucked <b>her</b> <b>under</b> the <b>chin</b> she could not have looked more surprised or indignant.|$|R
60|$|While speaking, she had unconsciously laid aside her fan, {{lifted her}} {{mantilla}} {{from her head}} with both hands, and, drawing it around <b>her</b> shoulders and <b>under</b> <b>her</b> lifted <b>chin,</b> had crossed it over her bosom with a certain prim, automatic gesture, {{as if it had}} been the starched kerchief of some remote Puritan ancestress. With her arms still unconsciously crossed, she stooped rigidly, picked up her fan with three fingers, {{as if it had been}} a prayer-book, and, with a slight inclination of her bared head, with its accurately parted brown hair, passed slowly out of the corridor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, bless us, Jinny," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, [...] "you haven't been parading {{the town in}} that costume! You'll have us in Lynch's slave pen by to-morrow night. My land!" [...] laughed he, patting <b>her</b> <b>under</b> the <b>chin,</b> [...] "there's no doubt about your sentiments, anyhow." ...|$|R
60|$|Anne Mie {{stood beside}} him, her pale, melancholy face peeping {{up at the}} tall Englishman, through the folds of a dark hood closely tied <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{sighed and}} sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son watched {{her face as}} it was lifted, and her small, {{work-hardened}} hands fingering at the bow <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{walked up}} and down rapidly, tying her chip hat <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> again. Then she stopped, and taking her chamois purse from her pocket, laid it sharply on the desk.|$|E
6000|$|As Miss Theo rose {{up out of}} this salute, her papa tapped <b>her</b> <b>under</b> the <b>chin</b> (which was of {{the double}} sort of chins), and laughingly hummed out the line which he had read the day. [...] "Eh bien! que dites-vous, ma fille, de notre hote?" ...|$|R
60|$|As the red cap of {{the young}} officer {{disappeared}} amidst the evergreen foliage, the young woman uttered a faint sigh, which she repeated a moment after as a slight nervous yawn. Then she opened and shut her fan once or twice, striking the sticks against her little pale palm, and then, gathering the lace <b>under</b> <b>her</b> oval <b>chin</b> with one hand, and catching her fan and skirt with the other, bent her head and dipped into the bushes. She {{came out on the}} other side near a low fence, that separated the park from a narrow lane which communicated with the high road beyond. As she neared the fence, a slinking figure limped along the lane before her. It was the tramp of the early morning.|$|R
60|$|Clytie did {{not wait}} for a second command. Without availing herself of the proffered company of McSnagley she hastily tied the strings of <b>her</b> school hat <b>under</b> <b>her</b> plump <b>chin,</b> and {{slipped out of the}} house. It was not far to the doctor's office, and Clytie walked quickly, {{overlooking}} in her haste and preoccupation the admiring glances which several of the swains of Smith's Pocket cast after her as she passed. But on arriving at the doctor's door, so out of breath and excited was this usual model of deportment that, on finding herself {{in the presence of the}} master and his friend, she only stood in embarrassed silence, and made up for her lack of verbal expression by a succession of eloquent blushes.|$|R
60|$|Anna nodded decisively, {{flashed a}} smile at Alma, {{picked up her}} cat, and went out. At the door she turned and looked back, with the big black cat snuggled <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pardon me,' said Mrs Wilfer, {{after the}} first salutations, {{and as soon as}} she had {{adjusted}} the handkerchief <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> and waved her gloved hands, 'to what am I indebted for this honour?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No." [...] Gillespie stood {{holding a}} bucket of milk in his hand; she sat {{gathering}} her shawl <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> {{as if she were}} still coming through the suncleft shadows of the woods pasture.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was with}} great {{trepidation}} {{that the good}} old dame ventured, but {{the result was that}} she was fairly subdued by Abenali's patriarchal dignity. She had never seen any manners to equal his, not EVEN when King Edward the Fourth had come to her father's house at the Barbican, chucked <b>her</b> <b>under</b> the <b>chin,</b> and called <b>her</b> a dainty duck! ...|$|R
60|$|Ridiculous {{though the}} two girls might have looked in our eyes, in those of their companions they only seemed {{peculiar}} and interesting, for the step between the sublime and ridiculous is altogether relative, in Eskimo-land as elsewhere. There was no opportunity, however, to dwell long in contemplation of any new thing, for the discoveries came thick and fast. Cowlik had barely succeeded in pulling the ear-pieces of the sou'-wester well down, and tying the strings <b>under</b> <b>her</b> fat <b>chin,</b> when a tremendous clanking was heard, as of some heavy creature approaching the cabin door. Cheenbuk dropped forward the point of his spear, and Nazinred kept his gun handy. Not that they were actually alarmed, of course, but they felt that in such unusual circumstances the least they could do was {{to be ready for}} whatever might befall--or turn up.|$|R
60|$|They hadn't gone {{much farther}} before {{the blade of}} one of the oars got fast in the water and WOULDN'T come out again (so Alice {{explained}} it afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught <b>her</b> <b>under</b> the <b>chin,</b> and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of 'Oh, oh, oh!' from poor Alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down among the heap of rushes.|$|R
