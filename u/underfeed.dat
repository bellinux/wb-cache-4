40|$|A {{grazing trial}} {{was carried out}} to examine the {{interactive}} effects of <b>underfeeding</b> in early lactation and cow breeding index on milk yield and composition. From the fifth week of lactation, 16 high and 16 low breeding index cows were fed at a restricted or ad libitum feeding level. Digestible organic matter intakes were estimated directly using the herbage cutting technique and indirectly using the chromic oxide technique. Intake was reduced due to <b>underfeeding</b> by approximately 45 % In comparison to cows on the ad libitum feeding level, underfed cows showed reductions in milk, milkfat and milk protein yields, milk protein concentration, long chain fatty acid concentration in the milkfat and liveweight gain. Milkfat concentration, short chain fatty acid concentration in the milkfat and loss in body condition were increased. Following the return of all cows to a generous feeding level, previously underfed cows produced lower daily yields of milk, milkfat and milk protein for three to five weeks and gained more liveweight and condition over mid-lactation. The residual effect of <b>underfeeding</b> on milkfat production was 1. 0 times the immediate effect. There appeared to be no effects of previous <b>underfeeding</b> on milk composition, concentrations of short chain or long chain fatty acids in the milkfat or digestible organic matter intake. Cow breeding index interacted with the effects of <b>underfeeding</b> in that high versus low breeding index cows showed (a) a smaller residual effect of <b>underfeeding</b> on milkfat production (0. 8 versus 2. 0 times the immediate effects, respectively) and (b) a greater immediate reduction in milk protein concentration due to <b>underfeeding...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{determined}} incidences of <b>underfeeding</b> and overfeeding {{in children}} who were admitted to a multidisciplinary tertiary pediatric intensive care and evaluated {{the usefulness of the}} respiratory quotient (RQ) obtained from indirect calorimetry to assess feeding adequacy. Methods: Children 18 y and younger who fulfilled the criteria for indirect calorimetry entered our prospective, observational study and were studied until day 14. Actual energy intake was recorded, compared with required energy intake (measured energy expenditure plus 10 %), and classified as <b>underfeeding</b> (110 % of required). We also evaluated the adequacy of a measured RQ lower than 0. 85 to identify <b>underfeeding,</b> and an RQ higher than 1. 0 to identify overfeeding. Results: Ninety-eight children underwent 195 calorimetric measurements. <b>Underfeeding,</b> adequate feeding, and overfeeding occurred on 21 %, 10 %, and 69 % of days, respectively. An RQ lower than 0. 85 to identify <b>underfeeding</b> showed low sensitivity (63 %), high specificity (89 %), and high negative predictive value (90 %). An RQ higher than 1. 0 to indicate overfeeding showed poor sensitivity (21 %), but a high specificity (97 %) and a high positive predictive value (93 %). Food composition, notably high-carbohydrate intake, was responsible for an RQ exceeding 1. 0 in the overfed group. Conclusion: Children admitted to the intensive care unit receive adequate feeding on only 10 % of measurement days during the first 2 wk of admission. The usefulness of RQ to monitor feeding adequacy is limited to identifying (carbohydrate) overfeeding and excluding <b>underfeeding...</b>|$|R

In order to keep them in subjection they <b>underfeed</b> them, and if any of them venture to steal cocoa-nuts from the trees the owners thereof are at liberty to shoot them and throw them into the sea.

40|$|Alterations {{in energy}} balance must be {{accommodated}} by adjustments {{in the net}} storage of the major energy-yielding macronutrients: carbohydrate, protein, and fat. This study used continuous whole-body calorimetry to measure changes in energy expenditure and substrate oxidation during a 12 -d imposed energy imbalance in six lean men on mixed diets (overfeeding: 16. 5 MJ/d, + 33 %, n = 3; underfeeding: 3. 5 MJ/d, - 67 %, n = 3). Changes in total energy expenditure (TEE) and its components were modest; TEE changed by + 6. 2 % (overfeeding) and - 10. 5 % (<b>underfeeding).</b> In consequence, body weight changed by + 2. 90 and - 3. 18 kg. Marked changes in metabolic fuel selection occurred {{over the course of}} the study. Carbohydrate intake (540 and 83 g/d for overfeeding and <b>underfeeding,</b> respectively) exerted direct autoregulatory feedback on carbohydrate oxidation (551 and 106 g/d at day 12 for overfeeding and <b>underfeeding,</b> respectively). Subjects were close to balance by day 5. Changes in protein oxidation were small and not sufficient to prevent the oxidation of body protein mass, or its accretion, in response to energy deficit or surplus. Fat oxidation (59 and 177 g/d for overfeeding and <b>underfeeding,</b> respectively) was not sensitive to dietary fat intake (150 and 20 g/d, for overfeeding and <b>underfeeding,</b> respectively), rather, its oxidation was inversely related to the oxidation of other substrates. Changes in fat balance accounted for 74. 1 % and 84. 0 % of the energy imbalance during overfeeding and <b>underfeeding,</b> respectively. This study shows a clear oxidative hierarchy for the macronutrients. Metabolic fuel selection is dominated by the need to maintain carbohydrate balance. This induces inappropriate counterregulatory alterations in fat oxidation during energy surplus...|$|R

Electronic databases including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and CENTRAL were searched up to September 2017 for trials evaluating intentional <b>underfeeding</b> versus targeted energy feeding interventions on clinical outcomes (mortality, length of stay, duration of ventilation, infective complications, feeding intolerance and glycaemic control) among critically ill adult patients.

40|$|Objectives - Decreased energy intake {{in older}} persons poses these {{people at risk}} of {{progressive}} weight loss. It may result from a failure to regulate energy intake and expenditure after periods of <b>underfeeding.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate if a period of <b>underfeeding</b> differentially influences energy intake of older compared with young men and, additionally, to study potential underlying mechanisms, namely changes in gastric emptying rate and cholecystokinin (CCK) levels in blood. Design/setting - Dietary intervention of 3 phases. After a phase of energy balance, we fed participants in phase 2 by a mean of 70 % of their needs for 21 days. During phase 3, we assessed ad libitum energy intake of the participants during 9 days. At the end of phases 1 and 2, we assessed appetite, gastric emptying, and CCK levels in blood in response to a test meal. Participants - Fifteen young (age 24 years [range 20 – 34], body mass index 23. 0 kg/m 2 ± 2. 3) and 17 older (age 68 years [64 – 85], body mass index 24. 5 kg/m 2 ± 1. 9) men participated in this study. Results - During energy balance, mean energy intake of young men (14. 3 ± 2. 3 MJ/day) was significantly higher than that of older men (11. 3 ± 1. 8 MJ/day, P <. 001). After the period of <b>underfeeding,</b> energy intake in phase 3 amounted to 16. 3 ± 2. 6 MJ/day in young men and to 14. 4 ± 3. 2 MJ/day in older men. Ad lib energy intake after <b>underfeeding</b> did not differ between young and older men (analysis of covariance, with energy intake during phase 1 as covariate, P =. 99). There were no differential changes in body weight, body composition, resting energy expenditure, gastric emptying rate, CCK- 8 levels, and appetite between young and older men during the study. Conclusion - Our results do not indicate that older men have an impaired ability to control energy intake after a period of <b>underfeeding</b> compared with younger men.
