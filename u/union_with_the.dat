5|$|In 1600 Lew Sapieha led a Commonwealth {{mission to}} Moscow {{to propose a}} <b>union</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Russian state, {{patterned}} after the Polish–Lithuanian <b>Union,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> boyars granted rights comparable {{with those of the}} Commonwealth's nobility. A decision on a single monarch was to be postponed until the death of the current king or tsar. Boris Godunov, at that time also engaged in negotiations with Charles of Sweden, wasn't interested in that close a relationship and only a twenty-year truce was agreed upon in 1602.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, Transylvania proclaimed <b>union</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Romania.

50|$|Harriman broke <b>with</b> <b>the</b> SLP {{during the}} acrimonious split of 1899, which was largely {{linked to the}} SLP's insistence on {{establishing}} competing socialist dual <b>unions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> existing trade <b>unions</b> affiliated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> American Federation of Labor.

5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and partly because {{of the impact of the}} sudden <b>union</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E
5|$|By 917, Simeon was {{preparing}} for yet another war against Byzantium. He attempted to conclude an anti-Byzantine <b>union</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pechenegs, but his envoys could not match the financial resources of the Byzantines, who succeeded in outbidding them. The Byzantines hatched a large-scale campaign against Bulgaria and also tried to persuade the Serbian Prince Petar Gojniković to attack the Bulgarians with Magyar support.|$|E
5|$|During the Hussite Wars of 1420–1434, Jagiełło, Vytautas and Sigismund Korybut were {{involved}} in political and military intrigues {{with respect to the}} Czech crown, which was offered by the Hussites to Jagiełło in 1420.

5|$|The Kingdom of Scotland {{emerged as}} an {{independent}} sovereign state in the Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707. By inheritance in 1603, James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland, thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms. Scotland subsequently entered into a political <b>union</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain. The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain, which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England. In 1801, Great Britain itself entered into a political <b>union</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|When Soviet troops, {{pursuant}} to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, invaded the eastern portion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin's direction. A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the western portion of Ukraine. Many inhabitants therefore initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent. Khrushchev's role was {{to ensure that the}} occupied areas voted for <b>union</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> USSR. Through a combination of propaganda, deception as to what was being voted for, and outright fraud, the Soviets ensured that their new territories would elect assemblies which would unanimously petition for <b>union</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> USSR. When the new assemblies did so, their petitions were granted by the USSR Supreme Soviet, and Western Ukraine became a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) on 1 November 1939. Clumsy actions by the Soviets, such as staffing Western Ukrainian organizations with Eastern Ukrainians, and giving confiscated land to collective farms (kolkhozes) rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians, damaging Khrushchev's efforts to achieve unity.|$|E
5|$|Between its 1968 debut and its {{appearance}} at the Beijing Olympics, Barbadian delegations appeared at every Summer Olympics except for the 1980 Summer Olympics, {{which took place in}} Moscow in the Soviet <b>Union.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> exceptions of the 1968 and the 2008 Barbadian teams, every appearance by Barbados at the Olympics (as of Beijing) included at least ten athletes; its smallest delegation arrived in 2008, carrying only eight competitors. All the delegations except the one that arrived in 1968 have included female athletes. Prior to and including the 2008 Beijing Olympics, there had been one medalist from Barbados. Obadele Thompson won a bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, as part of Barbados' most successful showing at any Olympic games as of 2008.|$|E

50|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> {{dissolution}} of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 Holstein's imperial vassal status turned void. It thus became a sovereign state. Because of its personal <b>union</b> <b>with</b> Denmark, <b>the</b> Duchy of Holstein did not come under French occupation during the Napoleonic era. From 1815 to 1864 it {{was a member of}} the German Confederation, though still in personal <b>union</b> <b>with</b> Denmark (<b>the</b> King of Denmark being also Duke of Holstein).|$|R
5|$|Greenland {{is one of}} {{the three}} {{constituent}} countries of the Kingdom of Denmark, with Queen Margrethe II as the reigning sovereign. The territory first came under monarchical rule in 1261, when the populace accepted the overlordship of the King of Norway; by 1360, Norway had entered into a personal <b>union</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Denmark, which became more entrenched with the union of the kingdoms into Denmark–Norway in 1536. After the dissolution of this arrangement in 1814, Greenland remained as a Danish colony, and, after its role in World War II, was granted its special status within the Kingdom of Denmark in 1953. The monarch is represented in the territory by the Rigsombudsmand (High Commissioner), Mikaela Engell.|$|E
5|$|In 1600, as Russia was {{entering}} {{a period of}} instability, the Commonwealth proposed a <b>union</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Russian state. This failed move was followed by many other similarly unsuccessful, often adventurous attempts, some involving military invasions, other dynastic and diplomatic manipulations and scheming. While {{the differences between the}} two societies and empires proved in the end too formidable to overcome, the Polish–Lithuanian state ended up in 1619, after the Truce of Deulino, with the greatest ever expansion of its territory. At the same time it was weakened by the huge military effort made.|$|E
5|$|Luxembourg {{has been}} an {{independent}} grand duchy since 9 June 1815. Originally, Luxembourg was in personal <b>union</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of the Netherlands from 16 March 1815 until 23 November 1890. While Wilhelmina succeeded Willem III in the Netherlands, this was not possible in Luxembourg due {{to the order of}} succession being based on Salic law at that time; he was succeeded instead by Adolphe. In a referendum held on 28 September 1919, 80.34 per cent voted in favor of keeping the monarchy. The current monarch is Henri.|$|E

At around 03:15 on 22 June 1941, the Axis Powers commenced {{the invasion of}} the Soviet <b>Union</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bombing of major cities in Soviet-occupied Poland and an artillery barrage on Red Army defences on the entire front. Air-raids were conducted as far as Kronstadt near Leningrad, Ismail in Bessarabia, and Sevastopol in the Crimea. Meanwhile, ground troops crossed the border, accompanied in some locales by Lithuanian and Ukrainian fifth columnists. Roughly three million soldiers of the Wehrmacht went into action and faced slightly fewer Soviet troops at the border.|$|E
5|$|On 29 October 1918 the Croatian Parliament (Sabor) {{declared}} {{independence and}} decided to join the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which in turn entered into <b>union</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Serbia on 4 December 1918 to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The Croatian Parliament never ratified a decision to unite with Serbia and Montenegro. The 1921 constitution defining {{the country as a}} unitary state and abolition of Croatian Parliament and historical administrative divisions effectively ended Croatian autonomy.|$|E
5|$|Partitions of Poland {{at the end}} of the 18th century {{brought an}} end to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
