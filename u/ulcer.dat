40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cimetidine}} on the healing and recurrence of duodenal <b>ulcers</b> and gastric <b>ulcers</b> were compared. The {{extent of the}} acid secreting areas was examined by the endoscopic Congo red methylene blue test. Using the extent of acid secreting areas gastric <b>ulcers</b> were classified into <b>ulcers</b> with and without extensive acid secreting areas. Duodenal <b>ulcers</b> were all associated with extensive acid secreting areas. The gastric acid outputs in the basal state and after maximal stimulation with gastrin were highest in duodenal <b>ulcers,</b> and lowest in gastric <b>ulcers</b> without extensive acid secreting areas. Cimetidine treatment significantly promoted the healing of duodenal <b>ulcers</b> and gastric <b>ulcers</b> with extensive acid secreting areas when compared with placebo, but not of the gastric <b>ulcers</b> without extensive acid secreting areas. Cimetidine also significantly diminished the recurrence of duodenal <b>ulcers,</b> but not gastric <b>ulcers</b> with and without extensive acid secreting areas. These findings indicate that in Japan cimetidine promotes the healing of duodenal and gastric <b>ulcers</b> associated with high gastric acid production and prevents recurrence of duodenal <b>ulcers,</b> but {{has little or no}} influence on the healing and recurrence of gastric <b>ulcers</b> associated with low acid secretion...|$|R

The {{incidence}} of Diabetes Mellitus has increased every year {{that was followed}} by increasing one of the complications of diabetic <b>ulcers.</b> Diabetic <b>ulcers</b> caused by several risk factors one of them is increased levels of Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL).

This study was an observational study with cross sectional approach.

The average result of the difference in LDL cholesterol among Type 2 DM patients with diabetic <b>ulcers</b> and withoutdiabetic <b>ulcers</b> is 107. 93 and 104. 22. The researchers can deduce the average of LDL cholesterol Type 2 DM patients with diabetic <b>ulcers</b> was higher than without diabetic <b>ulcers.</b> P value (sig) amounted to 0, 006 so that this study found a significant difference.

Before the end of the year, Jenner and Jessie began living together again. Although Jenner gave up gambling, he was often unemployed because he would evangelise at his workplace and then be fired. In 1939, Jessie developed a peptic <b>ulcer.</b> At the time, it was believed that such ulcers were caused by stress, and Jessie's <b>ulcer</b> was therefore attributed to the stress induced by the family's lack of money. Consequently, she and Ann moved to India to live with Jenner's aunt Emily McKenzie, who ran the Kotagiri Keswick Missionary Home.

5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal <b>ulcer,</b> iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal <b>ulcer.</b> Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E

5|$|This is a {{timeline}} {{of the events}} relating to the discovery that peptic <b>ulcer</b> disease and some cancers are caused by H. pylori. In 2005, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that peptic <b>ulcer</b> disease (PUD) was primarily caused by Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium with affinity for acidic environments, such as the stomach. As a result, PUD {{that is associated with}} H. pylori is currently treated with antibiotics used to eradicate the infection. For 30 years prior to their discovery, it was widely believed that PUD was caused by excess acid in the stomach. During this time, acid control was the primary method of treatment for PUD, to only partial success; among other effects, it is now known that acid suppression alters the stomach milieu to make it less amenable to H. pylori infection.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{proportion}} of duodenal <b>ulcers</b> {{not associated with}} Helicobacter pylori infection {{or the use of}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is increasing. Aim: To identify the clinical and endoscopic characteristics of non-H. pylori, non-NSAID duodenal <b>ulcers.</b> Methods: Clinical and endoscopic data and H. pylori status were prospectively collected from consecutive patients who underwent upper endoscopy from 1997 to 1999. Patients with duodenal <b>ulcers</b> were identified, and those with non-H. pylori, non-NSAID duodenal <b>ulcers</b> were analysed further. Results: A total of 11 717 upper endoscopies were performed in 8344 patients. Of these, 1153 (14 %) had duodenal <b>ulcers.</b> Of 599 patients with active <b>ulcers</b> and known H. pylori status. 104 (17 %) had <b>ulcers</b> not associated with H. pylori or the use of NSAIDs, 393 (66 %) had <b>ulcers</b> associated with H. pylori alone, 51 (8. 5 %) had <b>ulcers</b> {{associated with the use of}} NSAIDs alone and 51 (8. 5 %) had <b>ulcers</b> associated with both. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of concomitant diseases (odds ratio = 15. 0; 95 % confidence interval, 8. 64 - 25. 9; P < 0. 001) and the absence of epigastric pain/discomfort (odds ratio = 0. 52; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 29 - 0. 91 : P = 0. 022) were independent predictors for non-H. pylori, non-NSAID duodenal <b>ulcers.</b> Conclusions: Non-H. pylori, non-NSAID duodenal <b>ulcers</b> exhibit certain distinct clinical and endoscopic characteristics.
