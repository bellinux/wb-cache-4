25|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine drives two clutch packs. The outer clutch pack drives gears 1, 3, 5 (and 7 when fitted), and reverse — the outer clutch pack has a larger diameter compared to the inner clutch, and can therefore handle greater torque loadings. The inner clutch pack drives gears 2, 4, and 6. Instead of a standard large dry single-plate clutch, each clutch pack for the six-speed DSG {{is a collection of}} four small wet interleaved clutch plates (similar to a motorcycle wet multi-plate clutch). Due to space constraints, the two clutch assemblies are concentric, and the shafts within the gearbox are hollow and also concentric. Because the alternate clutch pack's gear-sets can be pre-selected (predictive shifts enabled via the unloaded section of the gearbox), un-powered time while shifting is avoided because the transmission of torque is simply switched from one clutch-pack to the other. This means that the DSG takes only about 8milliseconds to <b>upshift.</b> In comparison, the sequential manual transmission (SMT) in the Ferrari F430 Scuderia takes 60milliseconds to shift, or 150milliseconds in the Ferrari Enzo. The quoted time for upshifts is the time the wheels are completely non-powered.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- When {{pulse of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation impinges upon a moving plasmalneutral gas boundary, i. e., an ioniza-tion front, its frequency and duration are altered. The largest frequency <b>upshifts</b> and pulse compressions are obtained when radiation is incident on an ionization front moving {{at close to}} the speed of light. Such an ionization front is created when a short laser pulse photo-ionizes a gas through which it propa-gates. We have done theoretical and experimental work on the interaction of radiation with a relativistically propagating, un-derdense ionization front in a waveguide. In the experiment, 35 GHz microwave pulses were <b>upshifted</b> and compressed upon encountering a moving front. The frequency spectrum of the <b>upshifted</b> radiation was determined independently using sections of cutoff waveguides and a microwave diffraction grating. These frequency <b>upshifts</b> were proportional to the plasma density of the ionization front as predicted by the theory. The front density was determined using microwave interferometery. The pusewidths of the <b>upshifted</b> radiation were measured with fast diode detectors. These pulsewidth measurements were also in good agreement with the theory. Frequency <b>upshifts</b> and pulse compressions up to a factor of five were recorded in this experiment. 1...|$|R

50|$|Conventionally, {{automatic}} transmissions have selector positions {{that allow the}} driver to limit the maximum ratio that the transmission may engage.

50|$|Related to this {{amplitude}} modulation (AM), active mode-locking is frequency modulation (FM) mode-locking, {{which uses a}} modulator device based on the acousto-optic effect. This device, when placed in a laser cavity and driven with an electrical signal, induces a small, sinusoidally varying frequency shift in the light passing through it. If the frequency of modulation is matched to the round-trip time of the cavity, then some light in the cavity sees repeated <b>upshifts</b> in frequency, and some repeated downshifts. After many repetitions, the <b>upshifted</b> and downshifted light is swept out of the gain bandwidth of the laser.

5000|$|A tiptronic {{transmission}} can {{operate in the}} same manner as a conventional type of automatic transmission, but also offers the driver an additional method of manually overriding the automatic shift changes. By moving the shift lever into a second operating plane of the shift gate, equipped with two spring-loaded positions: [...] "upshift" [...] and [...] "downshift", the driver takes over most of the gear shifting decisions, which would ordinarily be performed by the transmission's computer. For example, this allows delayed upshifts for increased acceleration, increased engine braking, gear holding in curves, downshifting before passing, or early upshifting for cruising. On some models, the <b>upshift</b> and downshift operations can also be controlled by push-buttons or [...] "paddle shifters" [...] installed on the steering wheel, with an optional display in the instrument panel indicating the current gear selection. Since adding Tiptronic to a semi-automatic transmission involves an additional shift gate into the computer and update to the transmission software, it is inexpensive and lightweight to implement. Although tiptronic transmissions allow the driver a certain measure of discrete control, the tiptronic design is implemented using a torque converter like other automatic transmissions. A true tiptronic transmission is not a computer controlled manual transmission (with a conventional clutch), or semi-automatic transmission. Most tiptronic implementations still make some shifts automatically, primarily to protect the engine and transmission. For example, as used by licensee Audi, the five-speed tiptronic will automatically make the <b>upshift</b> from 1 to 2 when moving off from a stop, even when in manual mode; the transmission then waits for the user's <b>upshift</b> command before proceeding from 2 to 3, 3 to 4 and 4 to 5, although the transmission will still <b>upshift</b> if the redline is approached. On deceleration, the transmission will make all downshifts automatically when close to the tick-over or idle speed, to prevent the engine from stalling at too-low an RPM, although the user can accelerate any downshift that would not exceed the redline.|$|E
