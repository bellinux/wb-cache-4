40|$|Objectives: National {{guidelines}} recommend mobilisation in bed {{as early}} as possible after acute stroke. Little is known about the influence of <b>upright</b> <b>positioning</b> on real-time cerebral flow variables in patients with stroke. We aimed to assess whether cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) changes significantly after <b>upright</b> <b>positioning</b> in bed in the acute stroke phase. Design: Observational study. Participants: 47 patients with acute ischaemic stroke measured in the subacute phase after symptom onset and 20 healthy controls. Primary and secondary outcome measures: We recorded postural changes in bilateral transcranial Doppler (primary outcome) and simultaneously recorded nearinfrared spectroscopy, end-tidal CO 2, non-invasive blood pressure data and changes in neurological status (secondary outcomes). Methods: Postures included the supine, half sitting (45 degrees), sitting (70 degrees) and Trendelenburg (- 15 degrees) positions. Using multilevel analyses, we compared postural changes between hemispheres, outcome groups (using modified Rankin Scale) as well as between patients and healthy controls. Results: The mean patient age was 62 +/- 15 years and median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score on admission was 7 (IQR 5 - 14). Mean proportional CBFV changes on sitting were not significantly different between healthy controls and affected hemispheres in patients with stroke. No {{significant differences were found between}} affected and unaffected stroke hemispheres and between patients with unfavourable and favourable outcomes. During <b>upright</b> <b>positioning,</b> no neurological worsening or improvement was observed in any of the patients. Conclusions: No indications were found that <b>upright</b> <b>positioning</b> in bed in mild to moderately affected patients with stroke compromises flow and (frontal) oxygenation significantly during the subacute phase of stroke. Supine or Trendelenburg positioning does not seem to augment real-time flow variables...|$|R
40|$|Does {{delivery}} position {{affect the}} frequency or severity of perineal lacerations? Evidence-Based Answer: There {{is no significant}} difference between <b>upright</b> and recumbent <b>position</b> during the second stage of labor on the incidence of third and fourth degree perineal lacerations, but the incidence of second-degree lacerations is increased in women delivering in <b>upright</b> <b>positions</b> (SOR: A, meta-analysis). Among women with an epidural, there is no difference between <b>upright</b> or recumbent <b>position</b> in the incidence of any perineal laceration requiring suturing (SOR: A, meta-analysis).

5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the <b>upright</b> <b>position.</b> This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E

5|$|Firehawk {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains. There are six cars with four seats in each row {{for a total}} of 24 riders per train. There were three trains during the ride's first year at Geauga Lake, however only two have been used since. The third train became a parts donor for the first two. Originally, riders reclined on the lift hill – rather than in the station – and returned to an <b>upright</b> <b>position</b> prior to re-entering the station. However, this was changed to occur in the station due to problems that arose during the ride's first season. The trains feature the Firehawk logo on the front colored yellow and red.

5|$|The blood shift causes an {{increased}} respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly {{because of the}} diving reflex in breath-hold diving. Lung volume decreases in the <b>upright</b> <b>position,</b> owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and {{resistance to air flow}} in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume. There appears to be a connection between pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.|$|E

40|$|Birthing {{positions}} in {{the second stage of}} labour have been researched widely in the last three decades. <b>Upright</b> <b>positions</b> in this paper refer to positions attained while the spine is vertical (Sutton 2000) and other alternative positions which may facilitate normality in birth; kneeling, standing, squatting, sitting with the back at an upright angleof more than 45 degrees, all fours and lateral positions (De Jonge 2 ̆ 6 Langro-Janssen 2004). Recent evidence suggests that <b>upright</b> <b>positions</b> are associated with fewer episiotomies, less pain, reduced instrumental deliveries and shorter duration of second stage of labour (De Jonge et al 2004, Walsh 2011, Gupta et al 2012, Nieuwenhauijze et al 2012). Moreover, there has been evidence of better neonatal outcomes and increased maternal satisfaction when compared to supine positions.

40|$|Background and Purpose-The {{effects of}} early <b>upright</b> <b>positioning</b> in the acute phase of ischemic stroke on both blood {{pressure}} and functional outcome have not been previously examined. Methods-Prospective investigation of mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation in the supine, sitting, and (if achievable) active standing position 1, 2, and 3 days after an acute stroke was performed. Also investigated was {{the presence of a}} significant postural blood pressure rise and fall using orthostatic definitions and the relation to functional outcome after 3 months. Results-One hundred sixty-seven patients were included (mean age, 68. 5 +/- 15. 2 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 7). Approximately 60 % of the patients were able to stand. On average the mean arterial pressure increased when patients moved from the supine to sitting (Day 1 : Delta 3. 9 mm Hg; P Conclusions-We found that a significant blood pressure rise during early <b>upright</b> <b>positioning</b> in patients with acute stroke was independently associated with a favorable outcome.

40|$|Electrical {{impedance}} tomography (EIT) {{is used on}} the thorax {{to measure}} impedance changes due {{to the presence of}} air and blood in the lung. This experimental study was performed to investigate the effect of posture on cardiac and respiratory related impedance changes. EIT measurements were performed on 14 healthy subjects in left-, right lateral, prone, supine and <b>upright</b> <b>positions.</b> Simultaneously, tidal volume was recorded with an ultrasonic flowmeter. For image reconstruction, the classic Sheffield back-projection and three variants of the modern GREIT algorithm were applied with two different reference frames. Amplitudes of cardiac- and respiratory impedance changes were extracted and compared between the positions. We found significant differences in both cardiac and respiratory amplitudes between postures. Especially, supine and <b>upright</b> <b>positions</b> showed dramatic changes in amplitude. These differences between postures were unaffected by the change of reference frames in all reconstruction methods except of the classic Sheffield back projection. Possible sources that explain the observed posture dependency are discussed.
