25|$|Harrison County Coroner Gary T. Hargrove {{told the}} mayor and City Council that Hurricane Katrina had claimed 53 victims in Biloxi, as of January 30, 2006.

25|$|Two further {{unidentified}} {{males are}} estimated to have been killed between August and October 1976. One of these victims was buried directly above the body of William Carroll, who had been murdered on June 13, yet higher than the body of Rick Johnston, who was last seen on August 6. This particular <b>unidentified</b> <b>male</b> is estimated to have been aged between 15 and 24 {{years old and had}} light brown hair. Sequential burial patterns of victims within the crawl space, plus the circumstantial fact that Cram had not lived with Gacy before August 20, leave a possible date of between August 6 and August 20, 1976 as the time this particular man was murdered. The second <b>unidentified</b> <b>male</b> likely to have been murdered between August and October 1976 is a youth with dark brown hair, aged between 17 and 21 years old, who is known to have suffered from an abscessed tooth {{at the time of his}} murder. This male was buried in the northeast corner of the crawl space. Subsequent recollections by an employee of PDM Contractors of a trench Gacy had ordered him to dig on or before October 5, 1976, being the location where this particular victim was buried suggest a date between August and October 1976 as being when this man was murdered.|$|E

[...] MGM decided to use only part of Villa-Lobos's music in the actual film, turning instead to Bronislau Kaper {{for the rest of the}} music. From the score, Villa-Lobos compiled a work for soprano soloist, male chorus, and orchestra, which he titled Forest of the Amazon and recorded it in 1959 in stereo with Brazilian soprano Bidu Sayão, an <b>unidentified</b> <b>male</b> chorus, and the Symphony of the Air for United Artists Records.

2500|$|The Newton County John Does, also dubbed Adam and Brad, {{or simply}} as Victims A and [...] B or Victims 3 and 4, are two young <b>unidentified</b> <b>males</b> whose remains were {{discovered}} {{with those of}} two other men on October 18, 1983 in Lake Village, Newton County, Indiana by mushroom foragers. Their nicknames were given by Newton County coroner Scott McCord, elected in 2008, to remember that they were people. He learned that the [...] "victims had never been identified, returned to any family or buried". He renewed the investigation, recruiting Stephen Nawrocki, a noted forensic anthropologist at the University of Indianapolis, to examine the remains and help develop descriptions of the victims. Nawrocki also gained {{the assistance of the}} National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, whose experts drew portraits of the young men.|$|R

2500|$|The {{headless}} body of an <b>unidentified</b> <b>male</b> {{was found}} in a boxcar in New Castle, Pennsylvania, on July 1, 1936. Three headless victims were found in boxcars near McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, on May 3, 1940. All bore similar injuries to those inflicted by the Cleveland killer. Dismembered bodies were also found in the swamps near New Castle between the years 1921 and 1934 and between 1939 and 1942. In September 1940 an article in the New Castle News refers to the killer as [...] "The Murder Swamp Killer". The almost identical similarities between the victims in New Castle to those in Cleveland, Ohio, coupled with the similarities between New Castle's Murder Swamp and Cleveland's Kingsbury Run, both of which were directly connected by a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line, were enough to convince Cleveland Detective Peter Merylo that the New Castle murders were the work of the [...] "Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run". Merylo was convinced the connection was the railroad that ran twice a day between the two cities; he often rode the rails undercover looking for clues to the killer's identity.|$|E
2500|$|On June 3, 1976, Gacy {{killed a}} 17-year-old Lakeview youth named Michael Bonnin. He {{disappeared}} while traveling from Chicago to Waukegan, and was strangled with a ligature and {{buried in the}} crawl space. Ten days later, a 16-year-old Uptown youth named William Carroll was murdered and buried directly beneath Gacy's kitchen. Carroll {{may have been the}} first of four males known to have been murdered between June 13 and August 6, 1976, and who were buried in a common grave located beneath Gacy's kitchen and laundry room. The three identified youths killed between June 13 and August 6 were aged between 16 and 17 years old, whereas the only <b>unidentified</b> <b>male</b> known to have been murdered between these dates is a man with medium dark brown hair estimated to have been aged between 22 and 30 years old and between [...] and [...] (...) tall. This man had two missing upper front teeth {{at the time of his}} disappearance, leading investigators to believe this particular victim most likely wore a denture. He was buried directly beneath the body of a 16-year-old Minnesota youth named James Haakenson, who is last known to have phoned his family on August 5, and whose body was itself buried directly beneath that of a 17-year-old Bensenville youth named Rick Johnston, who was last seen alive on August 6.|$|E

40|$|Background: The genus Spelaeomyia {{includes}} four African species considered as being cavernicolous: Spelaeomyia darlingi, Spelaeomyia mirabilis, Spelaeomyia emilii and Spelaeomyia moucheti. Despite a potential role in Leishmania major leishmaniasis transmission in Mali, no molecular studies and only few morphological studies have addressed relationships between species of Spelaeomyia. Methods: Specimens of Sa. moucheti {{were collected in}} two different sites in Gabon. Spelaeomyia emilii and Sa. darlingi specimens came from Gabon and Mali. Specimens of Sa. mirabilis were collected in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Gabon. All specimens were caught using CDC miniature light traps, then dissected, both heads and genitalia were kept for morphological analysis {{and the rest of}} the bodies were kept for molecular processing and analyses. Results: Some <b>unidentified</b> <b>males</b> are associated to Sa. moucheti females using molecular tools and are described for the first time. A new morphological feature is observed on the spermathecae of the female and new drawings are provided. For the first time a phylogenetic analysis is carried out on rDNA and mtDNA markers and it shows that Sa. moucheti is the sister species of Sa. mirabilis. Conclusions: Spelaeomyia moucheti is the sister species of Sa. mirabilis. This result is in agreement with the sharing of morphological characters between these closely related species. Moreover, these two species are not as cavernicolous as literature previously indicated. They were caught in open rainforest in Gabon...|$|R

After five minutes had passed by, Heines still had not complied with the order.
