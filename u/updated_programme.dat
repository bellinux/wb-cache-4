50|$|The {{publication}} of Communist Party programmes in Britain {{began in the}} 1920s {{with the release of}} Class against Class, the General Election Programme of the Communist Party of Great Britain. This was published in 1929 by the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), the precursor to the Communist Party of Britain, for the general election of that year in which the party fielded 25 candidates. The subsequent programme, titled For Soviet Britain, was published for the party's 13th Congress in 1935.

These latest idents included an ITV1 logo that was bigger than the ones launched in 2006, but retained the same soundtrack. In April 2010, ITV1 HD was launched, featuring an updated glossier logo based on that of ITV1. In response, ITV1 changed their logo to the glossier version and launched another four idents. These latest idents have been noticeably different from their predecessors: the logo was once again larger and faded on in parts. They also featured individual soundtracks based on those previously and the style of the ident themselves, namely the shooting of them, was very different from those before them. They were accompanied on screen by <b>updated</b> <b>programme</b> promotions, end credit promotions, stings and break bumpers.|$|E

The second part of the diploma thesis is a monographic one in which a descriptive research method was used. The purpose of the research was to find out which motor skills are at the forefront when creating with movement and rhythm. Also, it needed to be established which loco motor challenges were used by the kindergarten teachers in order to implement »Mali sonček« programme. It was determined that almost all activities prepared by the kindergarten teachers were based on coordination. Results from the observation of activities show that the kindergarten teachers in most cases followed instructions and suggestions contained in the »Mali sonček« teacher's book.

40|$|Cardiac {{rehabilitation}} {{has been}} shown to improve exercise tolerance and symptomatology in patients experiencing angina or heart failure and reduce long term mortality after myocardial infarction, with a good cost-effectiveness ratio. In addition to these `hard' endpoints, cardiac rehabilitation improves the patient's quality of life and risk factor profile through a multifactorial intervention. Indeed, cardiac rehabilitation is no longer restricted to physical reconditioning, but should now be understood as the long term care of cardiac patients through a personalised and periodically <b>updated</b> <b>programme.</b> The components of a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programme should comprise risk stratification of the patient, physical reconditioning programmes, secondary prevention and vocational counselling. This article is a synthesis of the principal guidelines and recently published recommendations on cardiac rehabilitation. It focuses on the practical modalities of a cardiac rehabilitation programme, the setting up of the multidisciplinary team, the different facilities according to local possibilities and the patient's clinical status, the prescription of a personalised programme, safety measures and emergency procedures. Together with these general considerations, special populations which constitute new but growing indications for cardiac rehabilitation are addressed: patients with heart failure, elderly patients and women, who need specific management. In the future, cardiac rehabilitation should be characterised by a likely increase in its indications because of: 1. a predicted high prevalence of coronary artery disease (due to an aging population and an improvement in survival after a cardiac event) despite a lower mortality rate; 2. an expansion of the indications in both low and high risk patients. In low risk patients, the goals of cardiac rehabilitation will be to prevent further progression of coronary atheroma and preserve ventricular function by preventive measures such as lifestyle and medical treatment. The needs of high risk patients (who are essentially heart failure patients) are the restoration of autonomy, when lost, and a better quality of life through the improvement of exercise capacity: those patients who were formerly excluded from cardiac rehabilitation programmes are in fact those who are now deriving the greatest benefit from exercise training. Owing to the proven benefits of this new concept of the multifactorial approach, cardiac rehabilitation has, nowadays, {{become an integral part of}} the treatment of cardiac patients.

A total of 291 questionnaires was circulated. Of these, 100 were returned, equating to a response rate of 34 %. Results indicate that formulae and methods for determining runoff rates in urban and urbanising catchments are being applied very generally without due consideration being given to the statistical foundation underlying the methods.

The study showed that the majority of women resumed work following the <b>updating</b> <b>programme,</b> but not necessarily at a level commensurate with their qualifications and experience, nor in their original professional area.
