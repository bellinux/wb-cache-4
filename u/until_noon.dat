5|$|At dawn on August 11, one 300-man {{battalion}} of the 766th Regiment entered {{the village of}} P'ohang, creating a state of alarm among its populace. The village was only protected by a small force of South Korean Navy, Air Force and Army personnel comprising the rear guard of the ROK 3rd Division. The South Korean forces engaged the 766th forces around the village's middle school with small-arms fire <b>until</b> <b>noon.</b> At that point, North Korean armored vehicles moved in to reinforce the 766th troops and drove the South Koreans out of the village.|$|E

5|$|Dumouriez {{believed}} that Coburg would put his main strength {{on the right}} wing to protect the Austrian line of communications. Therefore, he planned to throw his heaviest blow against Coburg's left wing. Clerfayt's line stretched from Neerwinden, across Mittelwinden hill to Oberwinden village on the left. Dumouriez directed Valence to outflank Oberwinden with one column, attack Oberwinden frontally with the second and seize the Mittelwinden hill with the third. On Valence's left, Chartres was ordered to attack Neerwinden with his columns. At 7:00 AM, the French swarmed across the Little Gete but Valence was unable to capture the Mittelwinden hill <b>until</b> <b>noon.</b> The French seized Racour, Oberwinden and finally Neerwinden.|$|E
5|$|Further west, {{supporting}} {{attacks were}} to be launched by the 13th Division, with the 15th Infantry Regiment (IR) assaulting across the Ancre towards the front line held by the 106th Brigade between Dernancourt and Buire-sur-l'Ancre and then exploiting success by driving west towards the village of Ribemont-sur-Ancre, and the 13th IR attacking the 104th Brigade at Marrett Wood. The German artillery preparation was to start at 05:15 on 28 March, with the assault to begin at 06:00. During the night of 27/28 March, {{the commander of the}} German 2nd Army apparently came to the same conclusion as the regimental commanders of the 50th Reserve Division, as at 03:00 he ordered the attack to be delayed <b>until</b> <b>noon,</b> and later further postponed it, but the orders did not reach the divisions in time.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{plan for}} July 2 called for Longstreet {{to attack the}} Union's left flank, which would be {{followed}} up by Hill's attack on Cemetery Ridge near the center, while Ewell demonstrated on the Union right. Longstreet {{was not ready to}} attack as early as Lee envisioned. He received permission from Lee to wait for Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law's brigade (Hood's division) to reach the field before he advanced any of his other brigades; Law marched his men quickly, covering 28 miles in eleven hours, but did not arrive <b>until</b> <b>noon.</b> Three of Longstreet's brigades were still in march column, and some distance from the attack positions they would need to reach. All of Longstreet's divisions were forced to take a long detour while approaching the enemy position, misled by inadequate reconnaissance that failed to identify a completely concealed route.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the Polish leader, Colonel Józef Beck, {{believed}} that Warsaw should act rapidly to forestall the German {{occupation of the}} city. At noon on 30 September, Poland gave an ultimatum to the Czechoslovak government. It demanded the immediate evacuation of Czechoslovak troops and police and gave Prague time <b>until</b> <b>noon</b> the following day. At 11:45a.m. on 1 October the Czechoslovak foreign ministry called the Polish ambassador in Prague {{and told him that}} Poland could have what it wanted. The Polish Army, commanded by General Władysław Bortnowski, annexed an area of 801.5km² with a population of 227,399 people. Administratively the annexed area was divided between two counties: Frysztat and Cieszyn County. At the same time Slovakia lost to Hungary 10,390km² with 854,277 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|At 16:00 the {{regiment}} was attacked in force, but the Turks withdrew after suffering heavy casualties. But the British attack elsewhere had failed, and some units {{had been forced}} to retire, leaving {{the regiment}} exposed. They fought off attacks throughout the night, until 05:00 the next morning. Then for two hours they were harassed with sniper fire and hand grenades. Meldrum asked the brigade for reinforcements and more ammunition. There were no reserves of ammunition available and the only reinforcements were forty men from the 6th Battalion Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) who were sent to assist, but did not arrive <b>until</b> <b>noon.</b> At 14:00 Meldrum reported he could now hold out until nightfall and at 22:30 they were relieved {{by the rest of the}} Loyal Regiment and the 5th Battalion Wiltshire Regiment. In the day's fighting the regiment, from a total of 173 all ranks, had lost forty-three dead and seventy-four wounded.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the raid}} on Gaba Tepe, Leane rejoined his {{battalion}} {{in the main}} defensive line around the beachhead. Before dawn on 19 May, elements of the Ottoman 16th Division attacked the 3rd Brigade positions on Bolton's Ridge {{as part of a}} wider counterattack against the Anzac sector. During the fighting, Leane was located in a forward sap of the battalion trenches overlooking a gully where the Ottoman troops were congregating. From this position, Leane and two other 11th Battalion men killed a large number of Ottoman troops with their rifles, firing from dawn <b>until</b> <b>noon.</b> On 28 June, Leane's company went forward of Bolton's Ridge towards Turkey Knoll to provide covering fire for an abortive attack by the 9th Battalion on Ottoman trenches on Sniper's Ridge. This attack was a feint, intended to distract the Ottoman commanders from reinforcing their troops opposite an Allied attack at Cape Helles far to the south. The forward company position was completely untenable, the lead elements of Leane's company were raked by shrapnel and machine gun fire, and Leane was wounded in the face. Despite this, he remained with his unit. The two companies of the 11th Battalion that were committed to support the attack lost 21 killed and 42 wounded.|$|E

5|$|Li Shimin's {{plan was}} successful: apart from skirmishes {{between the two}} armies' cavalry, the two armies {{maintained}} their standoff from about 08:00 <b>until</b> <b>noon,</b> when the Xia troops began {{to show signs of}} thirst and weariness. Li Shimin, from a high vantage point, saw this and sent 300 cavalry in a probing attack. When he saw that the demoralized Xia recoiled from this assault, he sent more of his cavalry to turn Dou's left flank from the south. Dou reacted by ordering the withdrawal of his entire army from the river to the better defensive position offered by the eastern escarpment of the Sishui valley, but this manoeuvre created confusion in the Xia lines, breaking their battle order. Awaiting this opportunity, Li Shimin ordered his army to launch a general attack against the withdrawing Xia, himself spearheading the attack at the head of his remaining cavalry. Li Shimin always led from the front—accompanied by an elite force of 1000 black-clad, black-armoured horsemen—as indeed did most of the contemporary Chinese military leaders, who were expected to prove their personal bravery on the battlefield and motivate their men by their example, rather than stay in the rear and co-ordinate their army.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} the gap began at 7:30am on 11 August, as a flight of Savioa-Marchetti SM.81 medium bombers {{attacked}} British defenders on Punjab Ridge. This half-hour assault {{was followed by a}} long artillery bombardment lasting <b>until</b> <b>noon.</b> At 12:30, the infantry attack began. II Brigade began moving slowly towards the Indians through the trackless wilderness north of the road, XIV Brigade attacked Mill, Knobbly, and Observation Hills, and XV Brigade clambered atop Punjab Ridge, engaging its defenders. The attacks of XIV Brigade against the Rhodesians failed, but XV Brigade managed to drive off the Indian defenders of Punjab Ridge. Counterattacks were mounted against the Italians, but these were unsuccessful. The Italian {{attack on the}} hills was renewed the next day, 12 August. Black, Knobbly, and Mill Hills were {{on the receiving end of}} repeated assaults by XIV Brigade, and the weakest of them, Mill Hill, began to reel under the sustained pressure. By 4:00pm, the British defenses were being overrun, and after nightfall the British retreated from the Hill, spiking their guns as they left.|$|E
5|$|The western {{extension}} was {{the first}} to open to traffic. Following a brief dedication ceremony attended by Governor Keating, Transportation Secretary McCaleb, and OTA board member Bartlett, the highway opened on December 15, 2000. As with the first section of the turnpike, tolls were waived for the weekend; the road was free <b>until</b> <b>noon</b> on December 18. The south loop was opened in two segments. The first, from US-64/US-169 to South Elm Place in Broken Arrow, opened at 3p.m. August 15, 2001. The new segment remained toll-free until 7a.m. August 20. A rainy September pushed back the opening of {{the other half of the}} south loop by two months. The second half of the south loop, from Elm Place to New Orleans Street, opened at 2p.m. April 15, 2002. The final segment of the extension, connecting New Orleans Street and the Muskogee Turnpike to the Will Rogers Turnpike, was scheduled to open on August 16 of that year.|$|E

5|$|The Confederate assault, {{despite its}} shortcomings, was ferocious, causing {{some of the}} {{numerous}} inexperienced Union soldiers in Grant's new army to flee to the river for safety. Others fought well, but were forced to withdraw under strong pressure from the Confederates, and attempted to form new defensive lines. Many Union regiments fragmented entirely; the companies and sections that remained on the field attached themselves to other commands. Sherman, who had been negligent in preparing for an attack, became {{one of its most}} important elements. He appeared everywhere along his lines, inspiring his raw recruits to resist the initial assaults, despite the staggering losses on both sides. Sherman received two minor wounds and had three horses shot out from under him. Historian James M. McPherson cites the battle as the turning point of Sherman's life, helping him {{to become one of the}} North's premier generals. Sherman's division bore the brunt of the initial attack. Despite heavy fire on their position and their left flank crumbling, Sherman's men fought stubbornly, but the Union troops slowly lost ground and fell back to a position behind Shiloh Church. McClernand's division temporarily stabilized the position. Overall, however, Johnston's forces made steady progress <b>until</b> <b>noon,</b> rolling up Union positions one by one. As the Confederates advanced, many threw away their flintlock muskets and grabbed rifles dropped by the fleeing Union troops.|$|E
