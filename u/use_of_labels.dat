50|$|This <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>labels</b> should not, however, be {{confused}} with the actual status of the syntactic units to which the labels are attached. A more traditional understanding of clauses and phrases maintains that phrases are not clauses, and clauses are not phrases.

The characteristic trait of clauses, i.e. the presence of a subject and a (finite) verb, is absent from phrases. Clauses can be, however, embedded inside phrases.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} {{confusion}} about the distinction between clauses and phrases. This confusion {{is due in part}} to how these concepts are employed in the phrase structure grammars of the chomskyan tradition. In the 1970s, chomskyan grammars began labeling many clauses as CPs (i.e. complementizer phrases) or as IPs (i.e. inflection phrases), and then later as TPs (i.e. tense phrases), etc. The choice of labels was influenced by the theory-internal desire to use the labels consistently. The X-bar schema acknowledged at least three projection levels for every lexical head: a minimal projection (e.g. N, V, P, etc.), an intermediate projection (e.g. N', V', P', etc.), and a phrase level projection (e.g. NP, VP, PP, etc.). Extending this convention to the clausal categories occurred in the interest of the consistent <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>labels.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This {{involves}} stereotypes, {{words and}} images that possess symbolic powers that can cause different emotions. Symbolization {{can be described in}} three processes. It includes words such as [...] "deviant" [...] and, as Cohen would say, [...] "it becomes symbolic of a certain status." [...] By this he means that the word represents something meaningful. Then the object, which can include clothing, represents the word. Therefore, the object can also symbolize the status. Neutral words can symbolize an event or emotion. For example, people can have specific feelings connected to the word [...] "Hiroshima" [...] that remind them of the bombing that occurred there. Furthermore, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>labels</b> given to a person or word puts them in a certain group in society. Those individuals that are in that group are viewed and interpreted based on their label.|$|E

50|$|In this {{interview}} conducted in Lexington, Massachusetts on February 7, 2005, Chomsky begins by reminiscing about his early {{education in a}} Deweyite school and {{his relationship with his}} father, a Hebrew scholar, who first introduced him to Semitic linguistics. He goes on to recall his subsequent disappointment with the academic discipline of high school and college, which he only continued with under the influence of Zellig Harris, who ran the linguistics department at the University of Pennsylvania. He states that the academically unprestigious school allowed him an intellectual freedom that worked to his advantage but which means he is mostly self-educated with no formal training in any field, including linguistics. He rejects the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>labels</b> but accepts that he is an old fashioned conservative in regard to his taste in music, literature and classical liberal doctrines with political views that grow out of the anarcho-syndicalist tradition. He states that he finds the threatening of Enlightenment ideals by extremist religious beliefs a very worrisome feature of U.S. culture that is unique amongst industrial countries and has undermined democracy. He concludes that his goal in teaching and research has been to understand something about the human mind whilst his goal in activism has been to help people become engaged in overcoming human suffering.|$|E

The correlation between the preferable sizes and the efficient sizes is being traced and the relation between label size aesthetics and efficiency is being identified.

This study examines why reliance on labels found in previous studies is so common by exploring cognitive processes behind this labeling effect.

40|$|The label {{switching}} forwarding mechanism, {{which was}} derived from the connection oriented ATM protocol, is currently being applied to IP networks. <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> this mechanism brings significant advantages in terms of simplifying forwarding decisions as well as enabling implementation of comprehensive traffic engineering mechanisms. Label switching simplifies forwarding by replacing the longest-match prefix search algorithms with a simple lookup table. This thesis concentrates on examining the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>label</b> switching techniques for scalable best effort unicast forwarding. Most label switching protocols are capable of operating over cell based switched networks such as ATM, and we constrain this thesis to examining this case. In essence w e examine the implementation <b>of</b> <b>label</b> switching techniques in an Internet wide environment. The aim of this work is to examine ways of maximizing the percentage <b>of</b> packets following <b>label</b> switched paths and therefore reducing the number of packets that require traditional IP forwarding. We concentrate on core Internet routers. There is a significant body of literature proposing and examining implementations several label switching approaches such as: Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), IP Switching, IP Navigator, Aggregate Route Based IP Switching, and Tag Switching. W e present an extensive literature survey. In addition we present a comprehensive classification <b>of</b> <b>label</b> switching techniques to provide scalable best effort IP forwarding in the Internet. From this work we isolate several areas of work for further consideration. Specifically, these areas concern the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>label</b> switching forwarding in future IP networks including: an IP version 6 environment with highly aggregated routing tables; <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>label</b> switching in conjunction with congestion sensitive routing; and an optically switched network. The examination <b>of</b> <b>label</b> switching in hierarchical networks examines the impact a high level of IP routing table aggregation that will be associated with IP version 6.
