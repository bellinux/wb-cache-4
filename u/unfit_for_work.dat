5|$|Rightwise's {{new market}} cross only survived in its {{original}} form for a short time. During the English Reformation of the 1530s, the rood on the pinnacle was pulled down and the oratory became a storeroom. The octagonal plinth became a shopping arcade of small stalls. In 1549, a temporary gallows was erected at the cross for the mass execution of 60 {{of the participants in}} Kett's Rebellion, who had congregated in the marketplace during their brief capture of Norwich. In 1574, a local law was enacted demanding that all unemployed men were to assemble at the market cross each morning at 5.00am, along with the tools of their trade, and remain there for an hour in the hope that they would be offered work; a bonesetter was hired to treat any men who claimed they were <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> through injury. The success of this scheme is not recorded.|$|E
25|$|German and Soviet armies {{relied heavily}} on work horses to pull {{artillery}} and supplies. Horses {{seemed to be a}} cheap and reliable transport especially in the spring and fall mud of the Eastern Front but the associated costs of daily feeding, grooming and handling horses were staggering. In theory horse units could feed off the country, but grazing on grass alone rendered horses <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> and the troops had no time to spend searching the villages for fodder. Hard-working horses required up to twelve pounds of grain daily; fodder carried by the troops made up a major portion of their supply trains.|$|E
25|$|One {{conclusion}} of Black's 2011 report concerned the sickness benefits system. Black felt {{that too many}} claims for the out-of-work sickness benefit Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) {{did not meet the}} threshold for eligibility, yet a Work Capability Assessment (WCA) only took place after an 'assessment phase' lasting at least 13 weeks (during which, the claimant is nominally paid ESA but, in practice, receives {{the same amount of money}} as they would if they were on Jobseekers Allowance). She was concerned that this phase might wrongly lead some patients to believe that they were too ill to work - because they were receiving 'assessment rate' ESA and because their GP had indicated that they were not fit for work on the medical certificate needed to initiate a claim - and that it represented a substantial delay in returning to work for those claimants who would later be judged able to work despite their chronic illness or disability; she therefore recommended that the assessment phase be abolished and that ESA only be considered after a WCA has taken place and the claimant has been found <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Built in 1941, after ending its naval {{service in}} 1957 Darlwyne {{underwent}} considerable structural alteration, including {{the removal of}} its original watertight bulkheads and the conversion of its aft cabin into a large open cockpit. These changes adversely affected its seaworthiness. Surveyors' reports in 1964 and 1966 indicated that Darlwyne [...] was <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> in the open sea; furthermore, it carried no radio or distress flares, and its lifesaving aids were rudimetary.|$|E

2500|$|Survivors of the massacre, the {{majority}} of whom were women and children, were eventually put in places like Shark Island Concentration Camp, where the German authorities forced them to work as slave labour for German military and settlers.

2500|$|In 2014, {{the number}} of jobless claimants on the WCA waiting-list ballooned to {{more than half a}} million because of {{problems}} with the delivery of the WCA itself.

2500|$|On 20 July 1966, at {{the request}} of Barrett's daughter, Darlwyne was again {{examined}} by George Corke, who found the boat in generally poor condition. Among the faults he listed were dry rot, a weakening of the hull caused by the removal of various supporting frames, and signs that the hull has been [...] "pushed in" [...] below the waterline. Corke's report reiterated his earlier view that Darlwyne was presently <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> [...] in the open sea. This report was sent not to Barratt but to the family's solicitors, where {{in the days that followed}} it lay unread; there is no indication that Barratt was aware of its contents before 31 July.|$|E

50|$|On 19 July 1779, the Continental armada sailed from Boston, {{bound for}} Penobscot Bay. The {{expedition}} {{turned out to}} be a dismal failure. First, the fleet was <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> the <b>work</b> and was primarily composed of privateers. The military forces — as in the seagoing ones — lacked decisive leadership; and the land forces lacked artillery and necessary equipment and supplies. Cooperation between military and naval forces was entirely lacking, with the obvious end result that the entire expedition collapsed in disaster.|$|R

2500|$|In July 2008 a Green Paper was published, which James Purnell {{said was}} [...] "inspired by the reforms {{proposed}} by David Freud". It declared that [...] "between 2009 and 2013, all Incapacity Benefit claimants will be reassessed using a medical assessment called the Work Capability Assessment" [...] that would divide them into three groups: fit for work; <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> but fit for 'work-related activity'; or fit for neither. In the same month, Professor Paul Gregg {{was asked by}} the DWP to conduct a feasibility study of [...] "conditionality" [...] - a compulsory quid pro quo - as it might be applied to sickness benefit claimants. When responding to the Gregg Review, the DWP said that the study had recommended that conditionality be applied to [...] "the vast majority of people in receipt of Employment and Support Allowance".|$|E
2500|$|The {{mortality}} rate amongst the British soldiers was extremely high: ⅔ {{of the population}} of POWs died in the camp. It was suggested that this high rate was because most had come direct from Europe and were not acclimatised and had no idea about the importance of tropical hygiene. Tropical ulcers—which are often diphtheria appearing as a secondary infection of a skin disease—were a common medical complaint, along with dysentery, malaria, beri-beri, dengue, scabies, and septic bites and sores. 600 men out of 1000 were <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> in January 1943 owing to beri beri and skin conditions. Deaths from dysentery increased {{towards the end of the}} period of captivity. A British NCO, E. R. Pepler, commented that [...] "en wasted away from their normal weight of over ten stone [...] to three or four stones ... As the time passed on to 1945, the deaths in our camp [...] were taking place at two or three every day".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1917, the camp was struck by an {{epidemic}} of typhus. In January 1918, a quarantine {{was put in place}} by the three prisoner of war doctors practicing at the camp. Of the 5,036 prisoner, 1,548 were declared <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> 314 were sick, 2,379 were working outside the camp and 623 were held as regular prisoners. An inspection by major general Mitiev in the same month led to the enactment of a 21 day incubation period in barracks where a sick prisoner was found. From then on the healthy prisoners were separated from the sick by an armed guard. Mitiev's inspection also uncovered the deaths of 99 and 66 prisoners in December 1917 and January 1918 at the camp's Yambol depot. The depot's commander second lieutenant Hristozov had not filled the necessary forms properly and claimed to be oblivious to the cause of the deaths, while having taken no precautionary measures against the epidemic. When threatened with a court-martial Hristozov emphatically dismissed the warning. A post war Inter–Allied War Commission estimated that 4,142 Serbian nationals died in the camp and 2,000 more died while performing hard labor outside its limits. [...] On 21 May 1921, Sliven's local council lamented the condition of the camp's graveyard, which held the remains of Serbian prisoners of war and interned civilians.|$|E
