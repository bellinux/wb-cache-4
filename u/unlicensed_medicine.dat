40|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{in children}} are common but their predictors {{are not fully}} characterised. It is known that both increasing age and number of concomitant medicines increase ADR risk in children, {{and there is also}} some evidence that off-label and <b>unlicensed</b> <b>medicine</b> use may contribute. The purpose of the thesis was to characterise ADRs in children, focusing on known risk factors, which have not been adequately evaluated in the literature. The contribution of off-label and unlicensed prescribing to ADR risk in children was assessed in two large prospective studies.

40|$|Objectives There is {{widespread}} use of unlicensed medicines within primary and secondary care but little information is available around how these medicines are used. This analysis examines and evaluates the content and quality of relevant guidance documentation currently in use within the UK. Methods Guidance documents were identified through a literature search as well as email requests to pharmacy organisations throughout the UK. <b>Unlicensed</b> <b>medicine</b> documentation suitable {{for inclusion in the}} analysis underwent thematic analysis and quality assessment using the AGREE II tool. Key findings Thematic analysis of 52 guidelines revealed four parent themes: (1) Professional responsibility (2) Usage practicalities (3) Risk versus benefit (4) Controlling use. There was variability in scores across the AGREE II domains with areas covering Scope and Purpose and Clarity of Presentation scoring well.

40|$|Objectives - To {{explore the}} views and {{perspectives}} of {{children on the}} unlicensed/off-label use of medicines in children and on the participation of children in clinical trials. Methods - Focus-group discussions, involving school children, were carried out {{in a range of}} primary and secondary schools in Northern Ireland. A purposeful sample was chosen to facilitate representation of various socioeconomic groupings. Results - A total of 123 pupils, aged from 10 to 16 years, from six schools, participated in 16 focus groups. In general, pupils viewed the unlicensed/off-label use of medicines in children as unsafe and unethical and felt it is necessary to test medicines in children to improve the availability of licensed products. The majority felt that older children should be told, and that parents should be told, about the unlicensed/off-label use of medicines in children, yet they recognised some implications of this, such as potential medication non-adherence. Conclusions - This is the first study to explore the views of healthy children on <b>unlicensed</b> <b>medicine</b> use in children. Children were able to recognise potential risks associated with the unlicensed use of medicines and felt it is necessary to test and license more medicines in children.

Aim: Investigate such purchases by the Brazilian Federal Government from 2004 to 2013. Methods: Procurement data from a public-access databank that contains procurement information of the Brazilian Federal Government. Each procured item was cross-referenced to its active drug approval status in the Brazilian National Register (DOU). Exploratory analysis and trend measures were performed for the variables for mapping and characterizing the purchases of non-market approved drugs. Results: 614 (0. 14 %) purchases in ten years corresponding to 65 unlicensed medicines – some of which had orphan drug status – and 48 different active substances; with a growing trend in recent years.

Areas that have not been explored include: •	How and why prescribers choose to initiate them •	How and where pharmacists source them •	Patient use and awareness of ULM •	Perceptions of use Approach Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with prescribers (n= 11), pharmacists (n= 10) and patients (n= 7) sampled from both primary and secondary care in the North East of England. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Grounded theory analysis {{led to the development of}} themes and informed the selection of subsequent participants. Findings Several themes were identified across the data by healthcare professionals and patients in primary and secondary care, including: •	Healthcare professionals’ awareness of when they were using an ULM and their definition of an ULM •	Perceptions of safety of ULMs was elicited, including the lack of safety and efficacy data compared to licensed products and the perceived under-reporting of adverse effects •	Provision of information and whether patients were likely to be informed about the unlicensed status of their medicines, who the person to inform them should be and what information patients would want •	The place of <b>unlicensed</b> <b>medicine</b> use in the clinical management of a patient, including whether licensed alternatives were tried first •	Trust as an important aspect in the use of unlicensed medicines, this was apparent throughout the interviews and between all actors Lack of education and training for healthcare professionals around what an ULM is and the associated implications with their use, coupled with a lack of information seems to perpetuate problems identified in the use of ULM. Cost implications associated with ULM was a strong theme among primary care participants, however, many secondary care participants lacked an awareness of the associated costs which could lead to under-utilisation of viable alternatives. Costly and burdensome regulatory processes for medicines licensing were often cited for the use of ULMs and seemed to legitimise their routine use in practice. Consequences The lack of marketing authorisation creates many issues in the use of ULMs, including a lack of access to information and reduced intelligence around their safety and efficacy. Despite this they are generally perceived as safe. The regulatory implications of using ULMs and the potential variability between products, does not seem to be well understood.

These compounds have been demonstrated to display PDE5 inhibitory activity in vitro and presumably have similar effects when consumed, but have undergone no formal testing in either humans or animals, and as such may represent significant health risks to consumers of these products due to their unknown safety profile. Some {{attempts have been made to}} ban these drugs as <b>unlicensed</b> <b>medicines,</b> but progress has been slow so far, as even in those jurisdictions which have laws targeting designer drugs, the laws are drafted to ban analogs of illegal drugs of abuse, rather than analogs of prescription medicines.

Method Retrospective analysis of discharge summary letters of all discharges occurring between Jan 1997 to Dec 2012. Results 234 children (152 males and 82 females) were discharged with 117 (50 %) prescribed psychotropic medication at discharge. 133 medicines were prescribed (stimulants n = 49, antipsychotics n = 31, antidepressants n = 22, mood stabilisers n = 1, other ADHD medication n = 11, melatonin n = 10, benzodiazepines n = 7, other n = 2).

The study also aimed to explore the factors that influence physicians&# 39; prescribing decisions and priorities, and to understand the knowledge of the medicines licensing system among members of the public. Methods: Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd funded the online interview of 500 members of the general public and 249 prescribing physicians. Best practice standards were followed for questionnaire-based studies; no specific treatments or conditions were mentioned or discussed. Results: Few of the participating physicians, only 14 %, were very familiar with the UK General Medical Council (GMC) guidelines on the use of unlicensed medicines and just 17 % felt very comfortable prescribing an unlicensed medication when a licensed alternative was available. Key physician concerns included the lack of safety data (76 %), legal implications (76 %), and safety monitoring associated with <b>unlicensed</b> <b>medicine</b> use (71 %). Patients and physicians agreed that safety and efficacy are the most important prescribing considerations, although 48 % of participating physicians were worried that budget pressures may increase pressure to prescribe unlicensed medications on the basis of cost. A high proportion of patients (81 %) also indicated some degree of concern, were they to be prescribed an unlicensed medication when a licensed alternative was available specifically because it costs less. Conclusions: This UK-based questionnaire study suggests pervasive concerns among prescribers over the safety, monitoring, and legal implications of unlicensed prescribing. High levels of concern were expressed among patients and physicians if cost were to become an influential factor when making decisions between licensed and unlicensed medications.

40|$|Circadin 2 mg {{prolonged-release tablet}} {{is the only}} {{licensed}} melatonin product available in the UK. Circadin is indicated for patients with primary insomnia aged 55 and over, but is more widely used “off-label” to treat sleep disorders especially in the paediatric population. Children and older people often have difficulty swallowing tablets and dividing the tablet is sometimes required to ease administration. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the release profile of melatonin from Circadin tablets when divided or crushed, and compare this with release from intact tablets. Dissolution testing was also performed for unlicensed melatonin products for comparison. Dissolution tests were performed using the pharmacopoeial paddle apparatus, with melatonin release analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Melatonin content, hardness, friability, and disintegration of the products were also evaluated. The prolonged release of melatonin from Circadin tablets was unlike that of any other product tested. When divided into halves, Circadin preserved most of the prolonged-release characteristic (f 2 = 58), whereas quarter-cut and crushed tablet had a more immediate melatonin release profile. Circadin is significantly less expensive and should be preferred to <b>unlicensed</b> <b>medicines</b> which are not pharmaceutically equivalent and offer less quality assurance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The lack of {{availability}} of appropriate medicines for children is an extensive and well known problem. Paediatricians and Physicians who {{take care of}} the paediatric population are primarily exposed to cope with this negative situation very often as {{more than half of the}} children are prescribed off-label or <b>unlicensed</b> <b>medicines.</b> Discussion Medicinal products used to treat this population should be subjected to ethical research of high quality and be explicitly authorised for use in children as it happens in adults. For that reason, and following the US experience, the European Paediatric Regulation has been amended in January 2007 by the European Commission. The objective of the Paediatric Regulation is to improve the development of high quality and ethically researched medicines for children aged 0 to 17 years, to facilitate the {{availability of}} information on the use of medicines for children, without subjecting children to unnecessary trials, or delaying the authorisation of medicines for use in adults. Summary The Paediatric Regulation is dramatically changing the regulatory environment for paediatric medicines in Europe and is fuelling an increased number of clinical trials in the paediatric population. Nevertheless, there are some risks and pitfalls that need to be anticipated and controlled in order to ensure that children will ultimately benefit from this European initiative. </p...|$|R

Areas that have not previously been explored include; how and why prescribers choose to initiate them, how and where pharmacists source them, patient use and awareness of ULMs. This research study {{aimed to explore}} the perceptions of healthcare professionals and patients on the use of ULMs. Methods: Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with prescribers (n= 11), pharmacists (n= 10) and patients (n= 7) from primary and secondary care. A theoretical sampling approach was used; grounded theory analysis led to the development of themes and informed participant selection. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Themes were presented back to participants (n= 8) using two focus groups (healthcare professionals and patients separately). Ethical approvals from the NHS and University were obtained prior to completion of this research. Results: All interviewees had experience of either; prescribing, reviewing, dispensing or taking unlicensed medicines. Participants discussed several ULM scenarios including imported medicines, ‘Specials’, food supplements, ‘off-label’ use of medicines and investigational medicinal products. Several themes were identified across the data by healthcare professionals and patients in primary and secondary care, including: •	Healthcare professionals’ awareness of when they were using an ULM and their definition of an ULM •	Perceptions of safety of ULMs was elicited, including the lack of safety and efficacy data compared to licensed products and the perceived under-reporting of adverse effects •	Provision of information and whether patients were likely to be informed about the unlicensed status of their medicines, who the person to inform them should be and what information patients would want •	The place of <b>unlicensed</b> <b>medicine</b> use in the clinical management of a patient, including whether licensed alternatives were tried first •	Trust as an important aspect in the use of unlicensed medicines, this was apparent throughout the interviews and between all actors Lack of education and training for healthcare professionals around what an ULM is and the associated implications of their use, coupled with a lack of information seems to perpetuate problems identified in the use of ULM.

40|$|Background: Using {{medicines}} {{safe and}} effective {{is an essential part}} of the medicine safety agenda. An extensive and growing body of literature on the use of unlicensed medicines shows that the use of unlicensed medicines is related to increased incidence of adverse drug reactions. The use of these has not been reduced in spite of new regulatory approaches for medicine, and instructions from professional organizations. In December 2014, the Norwegian Medicines Agency introduced a regulatory change that entailed a medical justification when health personnel prescribe <b>unlicensed</b> <b>medicine</b> in Norway. The intention behind this was to prevent improper use and to emphasize the personal and legal responsibility of prescribing unlicensed medicines to patients. Objective: To analyze trends in price and consumption of unlicensed medicines in Norway before and after the regulatory change in December 2014. Methods: A linear time-series regression model with ordinary least square application was used to analyze the effect of the regulatory change, trends for all sales values and ATC codes. A data analysis was conducted to map how many units and daily defined doses there were of unlicensed medicines in the 1 st level of ATC codes from 2012 to 2016. It was also used to examine whether sales per unit (per package) was decreasing per month. Results: The regression analysis reported a statistically insignificant effect on total sales, indicating that the regulatory change had no effect on sales. Moreover, it indicated that there was a significant effect on five out of fourteen ATC codes. It is however, difficult to say that the regulatory change was the sole reason for this. Causal inference from the method is limited because it is not possible to dismiss other explanations for the observed changes in time-series. Furthermore, there was an overall increase in sales, units and daily defined doses. Conclusion: There is no significant effect of the regulatory change on sales and consumption. Further research is necessary to understand how unlicensed medicines are used. Without a full comprehension of this, it is difficult to suggest policies and processes to ensure that unlicensed medicines are used correctly...|$|E
40|$|Background - Limiting {{the amount}} of alcohol in children's {{medicines}} is advisable but as alcohol {{is the second most}} common solvent used in liquid preparations, paediatric patients with increased medication intake may be exposed to a considerable alcohol intake. Few medicines are specifically designed for children in Paediatric Intensive Care (PICU), and therefore adult formulations are frequently administered, with high medication use further exposing a PICU patient to undesired alcohol intake. Aims - This small pilot study aimed to examiine the intake of a sample of PICU patients, highlight common medicines used on PICU containing alcohol, provide alternatives where possible and where alternatives are not possible, provide the prescriber with a list of the higher alcohol containing medicines. Method - A retrospective medication chart review was undertaken as a two point snap shot. Data collected included age, weight, medications prescribed and the formulations used at time of the study. The patients' sedation score was recorded. The electronic medicine compendium (EMC) was consulted for any ethanol content for the commercially available products. The manufacturer was contacted for ethanol content of all ‘specials’ and any commercial products found to contain ethanol from the EMC. The PICU patient's daily intake of ethanol was calculated. The calculation was converted to an adult equivalent alcohol unit intake and although this method of conversion is crude and does not take physiological differences of adult and children into account, it was done in order to provide the clinician with commonly used terminology in deciding the risk to the patient. Results - Twenty-eight patients were prescribed a range of 69 different medications. Of the 69 medicines, 12 products were found to contain ethanol. Patient ages ranged from a 26 week premature infant to 15 years old, weights ranges from 0. 7 kg to 45 kg. Only 2 out of the 28 patients did not receive ethanol containing medications, and most patients were prescribed at least two medicines containing ethanol. Daily ethanol intake uncorrected for weight ranged from 0. 006 ml to 2. 18 ml (median 0. 26 ml). Converting this to adult units per week, alcohol intake ranged from 0. 07 to 15. 2 units (median 1. 4 units). The two patients receiving above 15 units/week adult equivalent were prescribed an oral morphine weaning regimen, therefore the high alcohol exposure was short term. The most common drugs prescribed containing alcohol were found to be nystatin, ranitidine, furosemide and morphine. No commercially available alcohol-free oral liquid preparations were found for ranitidine, furosemide or morphine {{at the time of the}} study. Correlation of the sedation score against ethanol intake was difficult to analyse as most patients were actively sedated. Conclusions - Polypharmacy in PICU patients increases the exposure to alcohol. Some commercially available medicines provide excessive ethanol intake, providing the clinician with ethical, potentially economical dilemmas of prescribing an <b>unlicensed</b> <b>medicine</b> to minimise ethanol exposure. Further research is required to evaluate the scope of the problem, effects of exposure and provision of alcohol free formulations...|$|E
5000|$|Sulfoaildenafil {{has been}} found as an {{adulterant}} {{in a variety of}} supplements which are sold as [...] "natural" [...] or [...] "herbal" [...] sexual enhancement products. [...] A range of designer analogues of USA FDA-approved inhibitors of type-5 cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE5), such as sildenafil and vardenafil, have been detected in recent years as adulturants in over-the-counter herbal aphrodisiac products and dietary supplements, in an apparent attempt to circumvent both the legal restrictions on sale of erectile dysfunction drugs, which are prescription-only medicines in most Western countries, and the patent protection which prevents sale of these drugs by competitors except under license to their inventors. These compounds have been demonstrated to display PDE5 inhibitory activity in vitro and presumably have similar effects when consumed, but have undergone no formal testing in either humans or animals, and as such represent a significant health risk to consumers of these products due to their unknown safety profile. Some {{attempts have been made to}} ban these drugs as <b>unlicensed</b> <b>medicines,</b> but progress has been slow so far, as even in those jurisdictions which have laws targeting designer drugs, the laws are drafted to ban analogues of illegal drugs of abuse, rather than analogues of prescription medicines. However at least one court case has resulted in a product being taken off the market.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 709 <b>unlicensed</b> and off-label <b>medicines</b> were {{prescribed}} for 338 patients discharged from a paediatric hospital between 1 November 2003 and 31 January 2004. Thirty three per cent of patients had difficulty obtaining these medications {{in primary care}} which caused treatment disruption. The main problems were: (1) community pharmacies being unable to supply; and (2) GPs' refusal to prescribe. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} illicit and <b>unlicensed</b> <b>medicines</b> are in general {{circulation}} and regularly {{seized by the}} police and other regulatory authorities. Forensic identification of seized tablets tends to focus on visual appearance and chromatographic identification of the contained drug. This process is relatively time consuming and places a strain on forensic laboratories. It was therefore of interest to investigate the possible application of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as a fast and efficient tool to facilitate the identification of contained drug/s and associated tablet excipients. Sixteen different cases (Cases A to P) of diazepam tablets obtained from Police Scotland were characterised based on visual appearance (colour and manufacturers' logos), physical attributes (size, weight and hardness), drug type, drug quantity (HPLC) and thermal properties (DSC). Raw DSC data was further processed using principal component analysis (PCA) as an objective assessment of the thermograms obtained with a view to statistical grouping of different cases. Cases J/K, M/O and L/P could be paired on visual appearance and Cases B/C/E/G and J/K/L/P on tablet hardness (17 – 23 and 80 – 89 N respectively). HPLC indicated that 75 % of the cases examined contained diazepam but less than half of these contained the recognised amount (10 mg); Cases B/E/L/P contained phenazepam and J/K contained etizolam. The thermal signatures of individual tablets provided by DSC produced qualitative information about both drugs and excipients, indicating lactose in Cases D/F/H/I/J/K/M/N/O and Emcompress™ in B/E/L/P. In particular, DSC coupled with PCA provided confident groupings of A/C/G, B/E/L/P and H/I/J/K, and specific pairings of B/E, L/P and F/N...|$|R
