40|$|Cluster Munition means a {{conventional}} munition {{that is designed}} to disperse or release explosive submunitions each weighing less than 20 kilograms, and includes those explosive submunitions. Cluster Munitions have the unique and deadly characteristics. First, each Cluster Munition contains tens or event hundreds submunitions which will break and spread out {{on the surface of the}} ground. Second, each <b>unexploded</b> <b>submunition</b> will turn become landmine which always active as a weapon and can be exploded by the presence, proximity, or contact of a person or a vehicle, anytime. Third, submunitions are designed with interested form resemble the objects of toys. The remnants of cluster munitions use will cause long-term harm such as pollute and contaminate the ex area of hostilities widely, chemical radiation on genetics, and a safety threat to civilian after the end of armed conflict, especially children. The problem of this thesis is how the protection for children from the attack of cluster munitions against the Houthi Group in Yemen by a Coalition of Saudi Arabia in terms of International Humanitarian Law. The research method used in this thesis is a normative legal research that focused on the positive legal norms in the form of instruments-instruments international humanitarian law governing the children protection in the armed conflict situation by doing comparative analysis. Data collection techniques in this thesis are using interview and literature study. The conclusions are obtained by using deductive procedure. The results of the legal research shows Coalition of Saudi Arabia was proven using various cluster munitions as weapons in that Yemen’s armed conflict which overset the International Humanitarian Law. The use of cluster munitions in the military attack that conducted by a Coalition of Saudi Arabia against the Houthi group also brings bad impacts for children in Yemen. Thousands of children have become the victims of both injured, sick, or died during armed conflicts and after the attacks took place during the last eighteen months because of a cluster munitions explosion. According to the International Humanitarian Law, cluster munitions were also banned for violating the military necessity and humanity principle. Therefore, children need to get guarantees of international protection either on the current situation even though postwar ends thoroughly and continuously...|$|E

Over this period an average of between 3 and 4 civilians had been killed or injured by <b>unexploded</b> <b>submunitions</b> every day - some 35% of these casualties were children. Civilian casualties will continue to rise {{as more and more}} people return to sift through the cluster munition infested rubble. Livelihoods have been destroyed, and desperately needed relief and rehabilitation has been impeded. Throughout southern Lebanon large areas of agricultural land are contaminated by failed but still potentially lethal ‘submunitions’. In many affected areas farmers {{have not been able to}} safely harvest what was left of this summer’s tobacco, wheat and fruit; late yielding crops such as olives will remain too dangerous to harvest by November and winter crops will be lost because farmers will be unable to plough their contaminated land to plant their grains and vegetables. Water and power supplies have been blocked and schools, roads, houses and gardens were still littered with <b>unexploded</b> <b>submunitions</b> when the field research for this report was undertaken one month after the ceasefire." ...|$|R

During the conflict, the country was subject to heavy aerial bombardment, resulting in the world’s largest contamination from <b>unexploded</b> <b>submunitions.</b> It is estimated that over 2 million tons of bombs were dropped on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. During the same period, anti-personnel and anti-tank mines were laid along the country’s borders and around military bases and airfields.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{a cluster}} weapon every {{component}} in this submunitions dispenser {{has been designed}} so that it cannot leave active, <b>unexploded</b> <b>submunitions.</b> For example, a submunition cannot detonate without a correct launch indication. If a faulty submunition was to be launched from the pod and by some unlikely event become active on the ground, the internal system has been designed so that the submunition cannot detonate for any reason, since it didn't receive a correct launch indication. There are many other design features resulting in that no active unexploded ordnance is left. The details about exactly how this is achieved are all classified.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a team of small autonomous robots that are designed to clear a field of <b>unexploded</b> <b>submunitions.</b> The ultimate application goals are to remove the explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) technician from hazards associated with submunitions; to perform the mission efficiently, reliably, and inexpensively; and to record pertinent mission information, such as area searched and location of submunitions found. Four robots coordinate to search for, pick up, and safely deposit submunitions lying on the ground surface using a control strategy of supervised autonomy. A remote Pentium laptop that communicates with the robot team via wireless radio serves two purposes: (1) as an off-board processor to dispatch the robots effectively, track their performance, and record data for postprocessing and (2) as an operator control unit to permit an EOD technician to monitor the mission and intervene as necessary from a safe distance. 1...|$|R
40|$|The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) is {{conducting}} an exploratory development {{program for the}} development of small, inexpensive, robotic technologies that enable systems that will clear <b>unexploded</b> <b>submunitions</b> and mines from contaminated land areas. The concentration is on control methodologies to enable teams of small autonomous robots to work together to perform either Pick-Up-Carry-Away (PUCA) or Blow-In-Place (BIP) operations on large numbers of small unexploded ordnance. Technology demonstration systems of small teams (5 robots) are being developed to explore feasibility. A high level of autonomy is required so that only one or two operators can control a large team of robots, since manpower available for these hazardous clearance operations is limited. Low cost is also required, since some of the robots may be destroyed by UXO, and many robots are needed to efficiently perform clearance. 1. INTRODUCTION The task of remov [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The MAT-120 cargo bomb is a Spanish-{{produced}} cluster munition, {{fired from}} a 120mm calibre mortar produced by Instalaza SA. The {{main body of the}} round holds dual-purpose anti-tank/anti-personnel submunitions. The MAT-120 submunitions are unique in that to prevent the dangers of unexploded duds, there is a double redundant feature the manufacture refers to as self-destruction and self-sterilization. This prevents <b>unexploded</b> MAT-120 <b>submunitions</b> from laying around becoming de facto landmines, dangerous to both combatants and non-combatants.|$|R

50|$|U.S. {{arguments}} {{favoring the}} use of cluster munitions are that their use reduces the number of aircraft and artillery systems needed to support military operations {{and if they were}} eliminated, significantly more money would have to be spent on new weapons, ammunition, and logistical resources. Also, militaries would need to increase their use of massed artillery and rocket barrages to get the same coverage, which would destroy or damage more key infrastructures. The U.S. was initially against any CCW negotiations but dropped its opposition in June 2007. Cluster munitions have been determined as needed for ensuring the country's national security interests, but measures are being taken to address humanitarian concerns of their use, as well as pursuing their original suggested alternative to a total ban of pursuing technological fixes to make the weapons no longer viable after the end of a conflict. In July 2012, the U.S. fired at a target area with 36 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) unitary warhead rockets. Analysis indicates that the same effects could have been made by four cluster GMLRS rockets. If cluster weapons cannot be used, the same operation would require using nine times as many rockets, cost nine times as much ($400,000 compared to $3.6 million), and take 40 times as long (30 seconds compared to 20 minutes) to execute. The U.S. suspended operational use of cluster munitions in 2003, and the U.S. Army ceased procurement of GMLRS cluster rockets in December 2008 because of a submunition dud rate as high as 5 percent. Pentagon policy is to have all cluster munitions used after 2018 to have a <b>submunition</b> <b>unexploded</b> ordnance rate of less than 1 percent. To achieve this, the Army has undertaken the Alternative Warhead Program (AWP) to assess and recommend technologies to reduce or eliminate cluster munition failures, as some 80 percent of U.S. military cluster weapons reside in Army artillery stockpiles.|$|R
