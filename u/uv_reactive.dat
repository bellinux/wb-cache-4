The four cleat fabrication techniques evaluated were ultra violet (<b>UV)</b> laser, <b>reactive</b> ion etching in oxygen plasma (RIE), mechanical scratching with a tungsten carbide cutting tool and chemical etching with KMnO 4. The mechanical and chemical methods were eliminated from the study as chemical etching produced large variations in cleat aperture and the mechanical method sheared off sections of the channel. The UV laser and RIE methods both produced channels that met the width, depth and shape criteria. Micro-Raman spectroscopy indicated that UV laser and RIE etching did not induce significant chemical changes on the coal surface. Soft-lithography moulds and SEM observations showed that the morphology of the walls in the RIE channel more closely resembled a natural cleat than {{the walls of the}} laser etched channel, which were much smoother.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether these aldehydes contribute to alter elastin metabolism and whether topical carbonyl scavengers delay UV-induced skin photoaging. Hairless mice (4 – 6 -week old) daily exposed to UV-A (20 Jcm- 2 per day, up to 600 Jcm- 2) exhibited the typical features of photoaging, associated with a significant increase in 4 -HNE- and acrolein-adduct content, and elastotic material deposition. Immunofluorescence studies showed the accumulation of 4 -HNE adducts on elastin in the dermis of UV-A-exposed mice. This was mimicked in vitro by incubating orcein-elastin with 4 -HNE or acrolein, which altered its digestion by leukocyte-elastase, a feature possibly involved in the accumulation of elastotic material. A daily topical application of carnosine completely reversed the development of photoaging alterations and 4 -HNE-adduct formation on elastin.

The toxicity assessment in vitro and in vivo revealed the good biocompatibility of the as-prepared FA-NPs-DOX nanocomposites.

Microbiological quality was determined by reference to nematode egg content, fecal coliforms, E. coli and somatic coliphages. Pathogenic nematode eggs were efficiently retained by the macrofiltration systems. However, since other types of nematode eggs were present in the effluents treated by both systems, the possibility of such infective agents appearing after this type of treatment cannot be discounted. The membrane technologies proved highly efficient at retaining micro-organisms, achieving effluents of excellent {{microbiological quality}}. However, the effluents could not be classified as sterile, since contamination of permeation zones gave rise to the presence of micro-organisms.

Both creams were stored at different storage conditions of 8 °C, 25 °C, 40 °C and 40 °C+ 75 % relative humidity to predict their stabilities.

The amount and the type of melanin is genetically determined, but they are strongly influenced by the other conditions such as hormonal and environmental: age, presence of metal ions, and inflammatory processes, and specifically exposure to sunlight. In vertebrates, melanocytes cells, responsible for the production of melanin, have the main function, but not exclusively, to protect the skin from the genotoxic stress produced by ultraviolet rays (UV); melanin absorbs the <b>UV</b> and neutralizers <b>reactive</b> oxygen species (ROS) they produce. Some studies clarified, at least in part, enzymatic and non enzymatic factors involved in the biosynthesis of melanin and the molecular mechanisms underlying the different responses of skin pigmentation to external stimuli, particularly to solar radiation. In this review we want to revise the cellular and biochemical aspects of skin pigmentation...|$|R
40|$|Diffraction {{gratings}} {{are very}} convenient elements for coupling out-of-plane light in planar waveguides of sub-micronic thickness. They {{have been investigated}} in dielectric [1] and highindex waveguides [2], and a platform for modeling has been created [3], but technology should still be improved for giving gratings efficient and simple as modeled. Standard methods like reactive ion etching through a photoresist mask, done with electron beam lithography or optical holography, give errors due to the initial surface roughness and to inaccurate corrugation control, {{and can not be}} used on micromechanical delicate structures. Focused Ion Beam (FIB) has been shown as a versatile powerful direct-write nanotechnology technique able to solve many of these problems [4]. It allows depositing and milling a variety of materials with nanometer resolution without masks nor sacrificial photosensitive layers. So, an important advantage of this technique is the ability of making sub-micron structures as the diffraction grating couplers onto chips with fragile elements, thus completing the technology. In this work, planar waveguide diffraction grating couplers in Si 3 N 4 rib waveguides fabricated by FIB are presented. The samples were obtained by standard thermal oxidation, silicon nitride LPCVD, <b>UV</b> photolithography and <b>reactive</b> ion etching, defining 40 µm larg...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to report}} the {{development}} of a laboratory-scale pilot to assess the ability of the photocatalytic filtration to remove antibiotics from water, using a low-cost photo-oxidative porous media functionalized/coated with TiO 2 nanoparticles using sol-gel method. The photo-oxidative reactor consists of filtration columns with a quartz porous media (with and without catalyst), which has the added value of allowing high permeability to solar <b>UV</b> radiation. This <b>reactive</b> filter was also designed to reproduce the hydraulic conditions observed in water treatment plants. Several testing scenarios were defined in order to study the really effects of hydraulics conditions, pH, DO, OTC initial concentration, and cumulative solar energy on OTC degradation efficiencies. The maximum removal efficiency of 98 % was achieved at a flow rate of 12 L/h, in a closed circuit, for an OTC initial concentration of 20 mg/L, and a pH near 6. The results confirmed the ability of this sustainable technology to deal with such a worrying environmental threat.
