5000|$|There {{is no one}} [...] "standard tuning" [...] for the Appalachian dulcimer, but as {{with the}} shape of the instrument, certain tuning {{arrangements}} have proven more popular than others. Traditionally, the Appalachian dulcimer was usually tuned (from left to right) to G3-G3-C3, C4-G3- C3, or C4-F3-C3. Note: Because the dulcimer is most often played on the lap or with the instrument laying on a table, when the instrument is held <b>upright</b> (<b>headstock</b> at the top), the highest pitched string will be on the leftâ€”this is the reverse of most other string instruments (e.g., guitar, bass, fiddle, etc.) where the lowest string is on the left. Dulcimer players, however, are accustomed to naming their strings from lowest to highest (as would a guitarist or violinist). which means that the strings are usually named reverse order from which they appear on the instrument, i.e., right to left. Thus the tunings cited above would more commonly be given as: C3-G3-G3; C3-G3-C4; and C3-F3-C4. This convention will be followed {{for the rest of the}} article.|$|E
