50|$|Mayor Angelo {{soon found}} himself {{involved}} {{in the details of}} municipal matters. He recalls that Midland was nearly broke, having less than $300,000 in its <b>unappropriated</b> <b>surplus</b> general fund. He and the council hence called for a sales tax election coupled with a lowering in city property taxes even though such a measure had been rejected a year earlier in 1971. No funds were spent to advertise the tax measure. Angelo and the council took on the responsibility of informing voters of the fiscal problems facing the city. The measure passed easily, and Midland prevailed strongly economically throughout the 1970s.|$|E
