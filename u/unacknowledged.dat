5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} Buddhaghosa's writing evinces a strong but <b>unacknowledged</b> Yogācāra Buddhist influence, which subsequently came to characterize Theravada thought {{in the wake of}} his profound influence on the Theravada tradition.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{acknowledged}} one illegitimate son: Charles Léon (1806–1881) by Eléonore Denuelle de La Plaigne. Alexandre Colonna-Walewski (1810–1868), {{the son of}} {{his mistress}} Maria Walewska, although acknowledged by Walewska's husband, was also widely known to be his child, and the DNA of his direct male descendant {{has been used to}} help confirm Napoleon's Y-chromosome haplotype. He may have had further <b>unacknowledged</b> illegitimate offspring as well, such as Eugen Megerle von Mühlfeld by Emilie Victoria Kraus and Hélène Napoleone Bonaparte (1816–1907) by Albine de Montholon.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It {{is used to}} explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. This view {{is often referred to}} as the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it is a theory which theorizes the existence of an <b>unacknowledged</b> theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E
5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, {{of which}} Britain was a signatory, did not ban {{submarines}} {{but it did}} ban their use against merchant ships, which was X1s <b>unacknowledged</b> purpose; its armament had been designed to successfully engage the classes of vessels likely to be escorting convoys, such as destroyers and frigates. Therefore, {{a certain amount of}} secrecy surrounded X1, the government even going to the lengths of taking a national newspaper to court over its pictures of the new submarine following her launch, all copies of the paper being seized.|$|E
5|$|The two lead {{characters}} are , a princess of the Narukami clan from the locality of Mino; and , a runaway ninja with no memories but a burning desire for vengeance. For {{the course of}} the game, Momohime is inadvertently possessed by the spirit of , an unscrupulous rōnin who was trying to possess the body of Momohime's betrothed , a high-status samurai. Momohime and Kisuke are each accompanied and watched over by a kitsune in human form. They are , who holds <b>unacknowledged</b> affection for Jinkuro, and , who aids Kisuke in his quest against the Demon Blades' corruption. A key character in Kisuke's storyline is , Momohime's sister.|$|E
5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and <b>unacknowledged</b> thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E
5|$|While in Paraguay, Paranhos had to {{deal with}} another serious issue. Gaston d'Orléans, Count of Eu—grandson of King Louis PhilippeI of France and husband of Emperor PedroII's {{daughter}} and heir Dona Isabel—had succeeded Caxias as Commander-in-Chief of Brazilian forces. After a brilliant beginning which included victories over the remnants of López's army, the Count fell into depression. Paranhos became the <b>unacknowledged,</b> de facto commander-in-chief. López was found and killed on 1 March 1870, bringing the war to an end. On 20 June 1870 the Emperor granted Paranhos the title of Viscount of Rio Branco ("White River", the name of a river that Paraguay claimed as its border with Brazil) with the added Grandeza ("Greatness") distinction. After returning to Brazil, Rio Branco became an ordinary member of the Council of State on 20 October 1870.|$|E

25|$|In {{military}} terminology, a black site is {{a location}} at which an <b>unacknowledged</b> black project is conducted. It can refer to the facilities that are controlled by the CIA and used by the U.S. government in its War on Terror to detain alleged unlawful enemy combatants.|$|E
25|$|De facto, <b>unacknowledged</b> or {{unplanned}} potable reuse {{refers to}} a situation where reuse of treated wastewater is, in fact, practiced but is not officially recognized. For example, a wastewater treatment plant from one city may be discharging effluents to a river which {{is used as a}} drinking water supply for another city downstream.|$|E
25|$|This {{is evident}} in Waverley. Rose is eminently marriageable; Flora is eminently passionate. However, we should also note that Welsh is, first, {{establishing}} a typology which in part is age-old, but also reinforced throughout the Waverley Novels; second, that Scott, or his narrators, allow the female characters thoughts, feelings and passions which are often ignored or <b>unacknowledged</b> by the heroes, such as Waverley.|$|E
25|$|Schiaparelli {{designed}} the wardrobe for several films, {{starting with the}} French version of 1933's Topaze, and ending with Zsa Zsa Gabor's outfits for the 1952 biopic of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Moulin Rouge in which Gabor played Jane Avril. Moulin Rouge won Marcel Vertès an Academy Award for Costume Design, although Schiaparelli's role in costuming the leading lady went <b>unacknowledged</b> beyond a prominent on-screen credit for Gabor's costumes. Authentically, Gabor's costumes were directly based upon Toulouse-Lautrec's portraits of Avril.|$|E
25|$|Hitchens wrote {{a monthly}} essay in The Atlantic and {{occasionally}} contributed to other literary journals. One of his books, <b>Unacknowledged</b> Legislation: Writers in the Public Sphere, collected these works. In Why Orwell Matters, he defends Orwell's writings against modern critics as relevant today and progressive for his time. In the 2008 book Christopher Hitchens and His Critics: Terror, Iraq, and the Left, many literary critiques are included of essays and other books of writers, such as David Horowitz and Edward Said.|$|E
25|$|In 1708, John Keill, {{writing in}} the journal of the Royal Society and with Newton's presumed blessing, accused Leibniz of having plagiarised Newton's {{calculus}}. Thus began the calculus priority dispute which darkened the remainder of Leibniz's life. A formal investigation by the Royal Society (in which Newton was an <b>unacknowledged</b> participant), undertaken in response to Leibniz's demand for a retraction, upheld Keill's charge. Historians of mathematics writing since 1900 or so have tended to acquit Leibniz, pointing to important differences between Leibniz's and Newton's versions of calculus.|$|E
25|$|His play The Skin of Our Teeth {{opened in}} New York on November 18, 1942, {{featuring}} Fredric March and Tallulah Bankhead. Again, the themes are familiar – the timeless human condition; history as progressive, cyclical, or entropic; literature, philosophy, and religion as the touchstones of civilization. Three acts dramatize the travails of the Antrobus family, allegorizing the alternate history of mankind. It was claimed by Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson, authors of A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake, {{that much of}} the play was the result of <b>unacknowledged</b> borrowing from James Joyce's last work.|$|E
25|$|Mitterrand's wife, Danielle Mitterrand (née Gouze, 1924–2011), {{came from}} a socialist {{background}} and worked for various left-wing causes. They married on 24 October 1944 and had three sons: Pascal (10 June 1945 – 17 September 1945), Jean-Christophe, born in 1946, and Gilbert, born on 4 February 1949. He also had two children as results of extra-marital affairs: an acknowledged daughter, Mazarine (born 1974), with his mistress Anne Pingeot, and a <b>unacknowledged</b> son, Hravn Forsne (born 1988), with Swedish journalist Christina Forsne. Hravn Forsne is currently running for {{a seat in the}} Swedish parliamentary election.|$|E
25|$|Fangio {{was never}} married, but was {{involved}} in a romantic relationship with Andrea Berruet whom he broke up with in 1960. They had a son named Oscar Cacho Espinosa who was acknowledged as the unrecognised son of Fangio in 2000. In July 2015, an Argentinian court ruling ordered exhumation of Fangio's body after Espinosa's claims to be the <b>unacknowledged</b> son of the former race car driver. In December 2015, the Court confirmed that Espinosa was indeed Fangio's son. In February 2016, it was confirmed that Rubén Vázquez is Fangio's son.|$|E
25|$|John Gerard, also spelt John Gerarde, (c. 1545–1612) was a {{botanist}} and herbalist. He {{maintained a}} large herbal garden in London. His chief notability is {{as the author}} of a large (1,484 pages) illustrated Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes. First published in 1597, it was the most widely circulated botany book in English in the 17th century. Except for the additions of a number of plants from his own garden and from North America, Gerard's Herbal is largely an <b>unacknowledged</b> English translation of Rembert Dodoens's herbal originally published in 1554, itself also highly popular (in Dutch, Latin, French and other English translations).|$|E
25|$|According to Amnesty {{annual report}} (2016) on Human Rights in UAE, {{enforced}} disappearance {{has been widely}} practiced against citizen and foreign nationals in UAE. The international organization said UAE government has forcibly disappeared dozens of people for months in secret and <b>unacknowledged</b> detention for interrogation. According to the report, Abdulrahman Bin Sobeih was subjected to enforced disappearance for three months by UAE authorities. In addition, Dr Nasser Bin Ghaith, an academic and economist, has been forcibly disappeared by the authorities for more than 10 months. Bin Ghaith {{has been subjected to}} torture and ill-treatment as he faced charges relating to his right to freedom of expression.|$|E
25|$|For Moltmann's {{second major}} work, The Crucified God, the {{philosophical}} inspiration {{comes from a}} different tendency within Marxist philosophy. In Explanation of the Theme, his introduction to the book, Moltmann acknowledges that {{the direction of his}} questioning has shifted to that of existentialist philosophy and the Marxism of the Frankfurt School, particularly Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer – close associates of Paul Tillich. An <b>unacknowledged</b> influence, and certainly an important parallel, is probably the Death of God theology that was winning notice in the mid-1960s, particularly the essay collection under that title, edited by William Hamilton and Thomas J. J. Altizer in memory of Paul Tillich.|$|E
25|$|His {{literary}} {{career began}} in 1842 {{with the publication}} of an essay, in Russian, on Dilettantism in Science, under the pseudonym of Iskander, the Turkish form of his Christian name. His second work, also in Russian, was his Letters on the Study of Nature (1845–46). In 1847 appeared his novel Who is to blame? This is a story about how the domestic happiness of a young tutor, who marries the <b>unacknowledged</b> daughter of a Russian sensualist of the old type, dull, ignorant and genial, is troubled by a Russian sensualist of the new school, intelligent, accomplished, and callous, with there being no possibility of saying who is most to blame for the tragic ending.|$|E
25|$|James Hillman, {{founder of}} archetypal {{psychology}}, has {{done much to}} expose the <b>unacknowledged</b> or shadow “Christianisms” within Jungian depth psychology itself. For example: One barrier to grasping the underworld or domain of Hades as the psychic realm is Christ’s victory over death. Similarly, the model for viewing the shadow as a moral problem is the Christian doctrine of sin. Hillman believes that soul or interiority refers not only to humans but to inanimate objects and to the world. Hillman is critical of Jung’s convention of equating symbols of roundness (e.g. the rose window of a cathedral) with the Self, and discourages the attempt to achieve undivided wholeness by integrating parts. Jung’s Self (representing the inner God) derives from monotheism, and by contrast Hillman encourages a polytheistic perspective.|$|E
25|$|The {{second and}} more serious problem, <b>unacknowledged</b> by bank management, the {{financial}} regulator and the Irish government, is solvency. The question concerning solvency has arisen due to domestic {{problems in the}} crashing Irish property market. AIB, like most Irish financial institutions, has substantial exposure to property developers in their loan portfolio. These property developers are currently suffering from gross over-supply of property, much still unsold, while demand has evaporated. The massive immigration from Eastern Europe which had propped up demand has now reversed due to rapidly rising unemployment in Ireland. Irish property developers own speculated billions of euros of overvalued land parcels such as urban brownfield and greenfield sites, and also agricultural land at an average value of €23,600 per acre (US$32,000 per acre or €60,000 per hectare) which is several multiples above the value of equivalent land in other European countries.|$|E
25|$|Over time, Moroccan {{women have}} gained {{more access to}} employment. However, this {{quantitative}} increase in labor participation for women has not been accompanied by higher qualitative standards of labor. The labor of rural women in Morocco remain <b>unacknowledged</b> and unpaid. Women are put into {{a higher risk of}} poverty as their domestic workload is added onto their unpaid labor. This balance of domestic labor and work outside the home imposes a burden on rural women. Since the socioeconomic exclusion of women deprive them of the capabilities to be educated and trained for certain employment skills, their susceptibility to poverty is heightened. Low educational skills of women directly relate to the limited employment options they have in society. Although both men and women are affected by unemployment, {{women are more likely to}} lose their jobs than men. Recent research in Morocco shows that economic recessions in the country affect women the most.|$|E
25|$|The second {{objective}} of the Synthetic Philosophy was to show that these same laws led inexorably to progress. In contrast to Comte, who stressed only the unity of scientific method, Spencer sought the unification of scientific knowledge {{in the form of}} the reduction of all natural laws to one fundamental law, the law of evolution. In this respect, he followed the model laid down by the Edinburgh publisher Robert Chambers in his anonymous Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844). Although often dismissed as a lightweight forerunner of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, Chambers' book was in reality a programme for the unification of science which aimed to show that Laplace's nebular hypothesis for the origin of the solar system and Lamarck's theory of species transformation were both instances (in Lewes' phrase) of 'one magnificent generalisation of progressive development.' Chambers was associated with Chapman's salon and his work served as the <b>unacknowledged</b> template for the Synthetic Philosophy.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 Beuys befriended his Düsseldorf {{colleague}} Nam June Paik, {{a member}} of the Fluxus movement. This was the beginning of what was to be a brief formal involvement with Fluxus, a loose international group of artists who championed a radical erosion of the boundaries of art, bringing aspects of creative practice outside of the institution and into the everyday. Although Beuys participated in a number of Fluxus events, {{it soon became clear that}} he viewed the implications of art's economic and institutional framework differently. Indeed, whereas Fluxus was directly inspired by the radical Dada activities emerging during the First World War, Beuys in 1964 broadcast (from Second German Television Studio) a rather different message: ‘Das Schweigen von Marcel Duchamp wird überbewertet’ (‘The Silence of Marcel Duchamp is Overrated’). Beuys's relationship with the legacy of Duchamp and the Readymade is a central (if often <b>unacknowledged)</b> aspect of the controversy surrounding his practice.|$|E
500|$|At Christmas 1894, the Munshi sent Lord Elgin {{a sentimental}} {{greeting}} card, which to Victoria's dismay went <b>unacknowledged.</b> Through Frederick Ponsonby, she complained to Elgin, who {{replied that he}} did [...] "not imagine that any acknowledgement was necessary, or that the Queen would expect him to send one", pointing out [...] "how impossible {{it would be for}} an Indian Viceroy to enter into correspondence of this kind".|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{is given}} credit for his stance on {{domestic}} affairs, {{which resulted in the}} passage and enforcement of environmental and regulatory legislation. Historian Paul Charles Milazzo in his 2011 paper on Nixon and the environment, points to Nixon's creation of the EPA and his enforcement of legislation such as the 1973 Endangered Species Act, stating that [...] "though unsought and <b>unacknowledged,</b> Richard Nixon's environmental legacy is secure".|$|E
500|$|Underwood {{is fond of}} {{the head}} of his Secret Service detail, Edward Meechum (Nathan Darrow), and it is hinted several times that they harbor <b>unacknowledged</b> sexual {{feelings}} for each other. When Meechum stumbles upon Underwood watching pornography, Underwood and Claire joke about there being sexual chemistry between the two men. [...] Shortly after Underwood becomes vice president, he, Claire and Meechum have a threesome.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Miracles" [...] {{focus on the}} {{extraordinary}} events humans experience in life which often go <b>unacknowledged,</b> and encourages listeners {{to take time to}} look at the world and reevaluate their life. The song's music is built around an ascending synthesizer melody, and climaxes with an electric guitar solo performed by Mike E. Clark, and beatboxing by Joseph Utsler. [...] "Chop Chop Slide" [...] was inspired by the [...] "Cha Cha Slide".|$|E
500|$|The Nine Satanic Statements {{outline the}} basic {{ideology}} of LaVeyan Satanism, {{and have become}} some of the guiding principles of LaVeyan Satanism. They {{also served as a}} template for later publications by LaVey, such as his 1987 [...] "Nine Satanic Sins". Ayn Rand's influence on LaVeyan Satanism is apparent in the Nine Satanic Statements, leading some, namely Nikolas Schreck, to assert that the Statements are simply <b>unacknowledged</b> paraphrase of Rand's thoughts. These accusations have been disproved, however.|$|E
500|$|For {{contractual}} reasons, on UK pressings of All Things Must Pass, Clapton's participation on {{the first}} two discs of the album remained <b>unacknowledged</b> for many years, although he was listed among the musicians appearing on the Apple Jam disc in Britain. Harrison was unaware of Collins's contribution until putting together the 30th anniversary reissue of the album in 2000, at which point he offered Collins his belated thanks. Clapton's former bandmate in Cream and Blind Faith, Ginger Baker, participated in the session for [...] "I Remember Jeep" [...] only, according to the album's sleeve notes.|$|E
500|$|Kimberly Roots, {{writing for}} TV Line, {{responded to the}} kiss scene by stating, [...] "What got me – and still gets me – about this kiss is how much fire it has. This isn’t a drunken, {{convenient}} hook-up. This isn’t a let’s-see-how-this-goes peck. This is two people acting on years of something <b>unacknowledged</b> between them. We get a long moment of LoVe in action before they break apart and realize what just happened." [...] Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Weapons of Class Destruction" [...] one of the [...] "10 essential episodes of Veronica Mars".|$|E
500|$|Nationally, a [...] "backlash" [...] took hold, {{as public}} support for disco music faded. According to author Craig Werner, as quoted in the British {{newspaper}} The Independent, the [...] "anti-disco movement represented an unholy alliance of funkateers and feminists, progressives and puritans, rockers and reactionaries. None the less, the attacks on disco gave respectable voice to the ugliest kinds of <b>unacknowledged</b> racism, sexism and homophobia." [...] By 1980 [...] "mainstream disco" [...] had ended, by 1985 WKTU had returned to playing rock music, {{and by the end}} of the decade the famous dance venues Studio54, Paradise Garage, and Clubhouse had all closed.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Esham {{signed to}} Psychopathic Records, {{releasing}} the compilation Acid Rain. It {{was announced that}} Esham would be {{moving away from the}} horror themes of his previous efforts. On November 18, 2003, Esham released his ninth studio album, Repentance. It peaked at #9 on the Top Heatseekers chart, #10 on the Top Independent Albums chart, and #71 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Jason Birchmeier wrote that [...] "Repentance is a small step forward for Esham.
