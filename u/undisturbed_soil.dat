In order to quantify the influence of air-drying and sieving with 2 mm meshes on the heterotrophic respiration response to soil water content we incubated intact cores and sieved samples of two loamy and two sandy soils for six levels of effective soil water saturation. We further determined soil textural properties and the soil water retention curves of the soils with the intent to identify links between soil physical characteristics and moisture sensitivity functions of heterotrophic respiration. The incubation of sieved and intact soils revealed distinct differences in the response of heterotrophic respiration to soil water content. The sieved soils exposed a threshold-type behaviour, whereas the <b>undisturbed</b> <b>soils</b> exposed a quadratic increase of heterotrophic respiration with increasing effective soil water saturation.

Therefore, it appears important, when analysing the effect of soil compaction due to agricultural machinery, to correlate {{air permeability}} with soil capacity parameters such as air-filled porosity, degree of saturation, water content, etc. In the present work, the relationship between air permeability, soil capacity parameters and vertical stress was analysed by performing confined uniaxial compression tests accompanied by air permeability measurements.
