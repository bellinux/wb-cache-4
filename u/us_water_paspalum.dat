The national system includes MPAs throughout the marine environment of the U.S. and its territories, including coastal areas, estuaries, oceans and the Great Lakes. As {{a first step in}} developing the national system of MPAs, the MPA Center compiled an MPA Inventory of all MPAs in <b>U.S.</b> <b>waters.</b> The <b>U.S.</b> has over 1,600 MPAs, ranging from typically small fully protected marine reserves where extractive uses are prohibited to large, multiple-use areas where fishing, diving and other uses are permitted.
