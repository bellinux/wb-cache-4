40|$|A recent highly disputed {{subject of}} {{regulating}} energy markets in Europe is the <b>unbundling</b> of vertically integrated down- and upstream firms. While legal <b>unbundling</b> is already implemented {{in most countries}} and indisputable in its necessity for approaching regulatory aims, continuative models as ownership <b>unbundling</b> or the alternative of an independent system operator are still ambiguous. Hence, this article contributes to the economic analyses of identifying the differences of separate types of <b>unbundling.</b> Via simulation, we find that legal <b>unbundling</b> brings about the lowest prices in a market under Cournot competition. Moreover, under Bertrand competition, no differences between legal <b>unbundling</b> and ownership <b>unbundling</b> can be identified.

In {{the second part}} <b>unbundling</b> costs are analyzed and in the third part, fulfillment of <b>unbundling</b> targets and its contribution to improve end-customer's position are assessed. The authors arrived to conclusion that <b>unbundling</b> contributed to decrease electricity end-price for households in the 2005 - 2008 period, despite substantial <b>unbundling</b> costs. However other factors, such as demand increase and electricity price convergence between the Czech Republic and Germany, were much stronger and caused substantial electricity price increase in the examined period.

We ?nd that <b>unbundling</b> may lower incentives for quality improvements, but raises incentives for cost reduction. Therefore, {{it is not true}} that all types of investment are crowded out with <b>unbundling.</b> If the regulator can commit to a socially optimal <b>unbundling</b> price before investment, the incumbent makes both types of investment. In the absence of commitment, the incumbent will not invest, so that <b>unbundling</b> regulation may lower welfare as compared to no regulation. ...|$|R

Substantially different results are found using dynamic rather than static analysis.

40|$|We analyze {{vertical}} structures where a regulated {{network operator}} serves n network users, {{and the network}} users compete in quantities for customers.

In general, legal <b>unbundling</b> implies a less effective regulation, but it reduces the degree of market distortion caused by the difference between marginal costs and average costs (= regulated prices of network usage). We find that the necessary condition is not satisfied for realistic values of the relevant parameters, i. e. legal <b>unbundling</b> leads to lower costumer prices than ownership <b>unbundling</b> in most relevant markets.

The 1992 Law was modified by Law No. 26876 (Anti-monopoly and Anti-oligopoly Law) in 1997.
