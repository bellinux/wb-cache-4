50|$|Calling an {{operating}} system directly {{is generally not}} possible under a system using protected memory. The OS runs at a more privileged level (kernel mode) than the <b>user</b> (<b>user</b> mode); a (software) interrupt is used to make requests to the operating system. This is rarely a feature in a higher-level language, and so wrapper functions for system calls are written using inline assembler.|$|E
50|$|The uucp and uuxqt {{capabilities}} {{could be}} used to send email between machines, with suitable mail user interfaces and delivery agent programs. A simple UUCP mail address was formed from the adjacent machine name, an exclamation mark (often pronounced bang), followed by the user name on the adjacent machine. For example, the address barbox!user would refer to <b>user</b> <b>user</b> on adjacent machine barbox.|$|E

50|$|User access enables {{users to}} assume a {{specific}} digital identity across applications, which enables access controls to be assigned and evaluated against this identity. The use of a single identity for a given user across multiple systems eases tasks for administrators and users. It simplifies access monitoring and verification and allows the organization to minimize excessive privileges granted to one <b>user.</b> <b>User</b> access can be tracked from initiation to termination of user access.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the context}} of the Microsoft Windows NT line of {{operating}} systems, a Security Identifier (commonly abbreviated SID) is a unique, immutable identifier of a <b>user,</b> <b>user</b> group, or other security principal. A security principal has a single SID for life (in a given domain), and all properties of the principal, including its name, are associated with the SID. This design allows a principal to be renamed (for example, from [...] "John" [...] to [...] "Jane") without affecting the security attributes of objects that refer to the principal.|$|E

50|$|User barbox!user would {{generally}} publish their UUCP {{email address}} {{in a form}} such as …!bigsite!foovax!barbox!user. This directs people to route their mail to machine bigsite (presumably a well-known and well-connected machine accessible to everybody) and from there through the machine foovax to the account of <b>user</b> <b>user</b> on barbox. Publishing a full path would be pointless, {{because it would be}} different, depending on where the sender was. (e.g. Ann at one site may have to send via path gway!tcol!canty!uoh!bigsite!foovax!barbox!user, whereas from somewhere else, Bill has to send via the path pdp10!router22!bigsite!foovax!barbox!user). Many users would suggest multiple routes from various large well-known sites, providing even better and perhaps faster connection service from the mail sender.|$|E
