50|$|McDouall and a {{party of}} {{soldiers}} from the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles, voyageurs and craftsmen journeyed north {{in the depths of}} winter from York, the provincial capital of Upper Canada, to the Nottawasaga River, where they constructed batteaux. (Glengarry Landing on the Nottawasaga River, where McDouall oversaw the construction of the flotilla, was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1923.) When the river <b>unfroze</b> <b>in</b> the spring, they sailed and paddled the length of Georgian Bay and Lake Huron to reach Mackinac with vital supplies. McDouall took up his post as commandant and began improving the defences of the island.|$|E

When time <b>unfreezes</b> <b>in</b> [...] "Hiros", Peter tells Mohinder about the encounter, but Mohinder is now convinced that Peter is crazy. Mohinder makes a decision: {{he will return}} to Madras with his father's ashes. Peter tries to convince him otherwise but to no avail.|$|R

He is shown {{to have the ability}} to freeze and <b>unfreeze</b> time <b>in</b> {{specific}} situations. He is deeply fond of many pop-culture sensations which explains his love for pop stars like Lady Gaga and the Jonas Brothers. Pazuzu and Vlaartark are often found together, generally up to some sort of mischief.|$|R

The situation was later resolved by Kingfisher ex-chairman Vijay Mallya meeting the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) chairman to <b>unfreeze</b> some A/C's. <b>In</b> the past several years, Kingfisher Airlines has had trouble paying their fuel bills.|$|R
40|$|Analyses of {{the last}} two rounds of general {{elections}} in the EU (old) 15 member-states, {{as well as of the}} 1999 and 2004 European elections, reveal some of the symptoms of what Key and Burnham called "critical elections": elections that mark a sudden, considerable and lasting realignment in the electorate, leading to the formation of new electoral majorities. I explore the hypothesis that these series of critical elections at the turn of the century are triggering a radical realignment under the pressures of a new fault-line of conflict aggregation [...] one shaped by attitudes to globalization. As a result, an opportunity-risk cleavage is emerging which is challenging, and opting out to replace, the capital-labor dynamics of conflict that have shaped the main political families in Europe over the 20 th century. This paper traces the dynamics of realignment in terms of shifts at four levels: 1) The public agenda of political mobilization; 2) The social composition of electoral constituencies 3) the ideological basis of party competition. On this basis, an alignment is taking place, on the one hand between the centre-left and centre-right midpoint around an "opportunity" pole and, on the other, the circumference of far-right and radical-left parties around a "risk" pole. To what extend will these pressures of realignment manage to <b>unfreeze</b> (<b>in</b> reference to Rokkan and Lipset) the established party-political constellations in nation-states remains to the determined. However, tensions between the analyzed pressures of realignment and existing institutionalized forms of political representation go a long way in explaining the current crisis within both Social Democracy and European Conservatism, as well as the rise of new forms of populism in Europe...|$|R

Broadly, in Reddin’s book, The Output Oriented Organization, it was designed around Lewin’s work on change in the social systems {{and the ability to}} understand it the same way as physical change. This is seen in Lewin's research <b>in</b> <b>unfreezing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Following a {{late morning}} {{interview}} with Secretary Cordell Hull on 8 December, Seni {{returned to his}} legation to confer with his staff. The ambassador and his staff unanimously decided to cast their lot with the Allies. Late the same afternoon, {{he returned to the}} State Department to offer their services to the Allied cause. Blaming pro-Japanese elements for the early Thai surrender, he spoke to Hull of <b>unfreezing</b> Thai assets <b>in</b> the United States for further prosecution of the war and suggested that the Thais in the country might [...] "organise and preserve a government of true patriotic, liberty-loving Thais while his government is in the clutches of Japan." ...|$|R
40|$|For {{magnetic}} reconnection to proceed, the frozen-in {{condition for}} both ion fluid and electron fluid in a localized diffusion region must be violated by inertial effects, thermal pressure effects, or inter-species collisions. It has been unclear which underlying effects <b>unfreeze</b> ion fluid <b>in</b> the diffusion region. By analyzing in situ THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) spacecraft measurements at the dayside magnetopause, we present {{clear evidence that}} the off-diagonal components of the ion pressure tensor is mainly responsible for breaking the ion frozen-in condition in reconnection. The off-diagonal pressure tensor, which corresponds to a non-gyrotropic pressure effect in this event, is a fluid manifestation of ion demagnetization in the diffusion region. From {{the perspective of the}} ion momentum equation, the reported non-gyrotropic ion pressure tensor is a fundamental aspect in specifying the reconnection electric field that controls how quickly reconnection proceeds...|$|R
5000|$|As Piper {{first comes}} into her powers, the first power she {{develops}} {{is the ability}} to slow down molecular motion so that objects, people, and even energy discharges instantly freeze in place. In the Charmed series, certain magical powers are attached to emotional triggers, although all powers can be affected by the user's emotions. For Piper, the emotional trigger for her freezing power is panic induced situations which enact a fear response. At first Piper would freeze everything in the immediate area whenever startled. Gradually, Piper learned to control this ability and freeze everything in the immediate area by a conscious act of will and gesturing. She must be able to gesture to activate her freezing power and cannot do so without using her hands. Piper also learns to selectively freeze specific objects of her choosing, rather than everything in the entire area. When Piper was new to her powers, objects she froze would eventually regain their mobility on their own, usually after several seconds. She later learns to unfreeze at will, even freezing an entire object, then unfreezing only part of it. This {{can be seen in the}} season three episode, [...] "Sleuthing with the Enemy", at which point Piper freezes a Zohtar demon named Krell (Scott MacDonald) <b>in</b> midair, then <b>unfreezes</b> his head <b>in</b> order to interrogate him.|$|R
40|$|Doped ice V samples {{made from}} {{solutions}} containing 0. 01 M HCl (DCl), HF (DF), or KOH (KOD) in H 2 O (D 2 O) were slow-cooled from 250 to 77 K at 0. 5 GPa. The {{effect of the}} dopant on the hydrogen disorder -> order transition and formation of hydrogen ordered ice XIII was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with samples recovered at 77 K. DSC scans of acid-doped samples are consistent with a reversible ice XIII ice V phase transition at ambient pressure, showing an endothermic peak on heating due to the hydrogen ordered ice XIII disordered ice V phase transition, and an exothermic peak on subsequent cooling due to the ice V -> ice XIII phase transition. The equilibrium temperature (To) for the ice V ice XIII phase transition is 112 K for both HCl doped H 2 O and DCl doped D 2 O. From the maximal enthalpy change of 250 J mol(- 1) on the ice XIII -> ice V phase transition and To of 112 K, the change in configurational entropy for the ice XIII -> ice V transition is calculated as 2. 23 J mol(- 1) K- 1 which is 66 % of the Pauling entropy. For HCl, the most effective dopant, the influence of HCl concentration on the formation of ice XIII was determined: on decreasing the concentration of HCl from 0. 01 to 0. 001 M, its effectiveness is only slightly lowered. However, further HCl decrease to 0. 0001 M drastically lowered its effectiveness. HF (DF) doping is less effective in inducing formation of ice XIII than HCl (DCl) doping. On heating {{at a rate of}} 5 K min(- 1), kinetic <b>unfreezing</b> starts <b>in</b> pure ice V at similar to 132 K, whereas in acid doped ice XIII it starts at about 105 K due to acceleration of reorientation of water molecules. KOH doping does not lead to formation of hydrogen ordered ice XIII, a result which is consistent with our powder neutron diffraction study (C. G. Salzmann, P. G. Radaelli, A. Hallbrucker, E. Mayer, J. L. Finney, Science, 2006, 311, 1758). We further conjecture whether or not ice XIII has a stable region in the water/ice phase diagram, and on a metastable triple point where ice XIII, ice V and ice II are in equilibrium...|$|R
