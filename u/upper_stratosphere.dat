25|$|Aerosol {{particles}} in the atmosphere impact the health of humans and influence monsoon and global atmospheric circulation systems. Some aerosols produce clouds which cool the Earth by reflecting sunlight back to space, while others, like soot, produce thin clouds in the <b>upper</b> <b>stratosphere</b> which behave like a greenhouse, warming the Earth. On balance, anthropogenic aerosols probably produce a net negative radiative forcing (cooling influence). Worldwide each year, aerosol particles result in about 800,000 premature deaths.

On this basis, a range of model atmospheres was produced, reflecting current uncertainties concerning CH 4 collisional excitation rates. At 0. 1 mbar, all of the non-LTE models are within 2 K of the LTE reference models; the extreme non-LTE models steadily depart from reference LTE ones, however, and reach about + or - 20 K at 0, 1 mbar...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies using}} {{satellite}} measurements showed evidence that subtropical <b>upper</b> troposphere/lower <b>stratosphere</b> ozone (O_ 3) can be modulated by tropical intraseasonal variability, {{the most dominant}} form {{of which is the}} Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) with a period of 30 – 60 [*]days. Here we further study the MJO modulation in the <b>upper</b> troposphere/lower <b>stratosphere</b> O_ 3 over the northern extratropics and the Arctic. Significant MJO-related O_ 3 signals (13 – 20 Dobson units) are found over the northern extratropics (north of 30 °N). The O_ 3 anomalies change their magnitude and patterns depending on the phase of the MJO. Over the Arctic, the MJO-related O_ 3 anomalies are dominated by a wave number 2 structure and are anticorrelated with the geopotential height (GPH) anomalies at 250 [*]hPa. The latter is similar to the findings in the previous studies over subtropics and indicates that the Arctic <b>upper</b> troposphere/lower <b>stratosphere</b> O_ 3 anomalies are associated with dynamical motions near the tropopause. The teleconnection from the tropics to the Arctic is likely through propagation of planetary waves generated by the equatorial heating that affects the tropopause height and O_ 3 at high latitudes...|$|R
25|$|A minor {{nuclear war}} with each country using 50 Hiroshima-sized atom bombs as air-bursts on urban areas could produce climate change {{unprecedented}} in recorded human history.

2500|$|Since {{the late}} 1970s, {{the use of}} CFCs has been heavily {{regulated}} because of their destructive effects on the ozone layer. After the development of his electron capture detector, James Lovelock {{was the first to}} detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air, finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC-11 over Ireland. In a self-funded research expedition ending in 1973, Lovelock went on to measure CFC-11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic, finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected, and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment. The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who, after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock's work, embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974. It turns out that one of CFCs' most attractive features—their low reactivity— is key to their most destructive effects. CFCs' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years, giving them time to diffuse into the <b>upper</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> [...] Once in the stratosphere, the sun's ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the C-Cl bond.|$|E
2500|$|Decades later, Adams' {{highly publicized}} {{life and death}} at a young age, his friendships with {{cultural}} icons such as James Dean and Elvis Presley, and his reported drug consumption made his private life the subject of many reports and assertions by some writers who have claimed Adams may have been gay or bisexual. One of the earliest published mentions on this overall topic was made by gossip columnist Rona Barrett in her 1974 autobiography, in which she made no assertion Adams was homosexual or bisexual but claimed Adams had told her, along with a [...] "whole roomful of people -- that he wasn't making it because no one in Hollywood's <b>upper</b> <b>stratosphere</b> would accept his wife." [...] Barrett wrote, [...] "This was untrue.

Hollywood biographer Lawrence J.

40|$|We {{have used}} the Global Modeling Initiative {{chemistry}} and transport model to simulate the radionuclides radon- 222 and lead- 210 using three different sets of input meteorological information: 1.  Output from the Goddard Space Flight Center Global Modeling and Assimilation Office GEOS-STRAT assimilation; 2. Output from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies GISS II' general circulation model; and 3.  Output from the National Center for Atmospheric Research MACCM 3 general circulation model. We intercompare these simulations with observations to determine the variability resulting from the different meteorological data used to drive the model, and to assess the agreement of the simulations with observations at the surface and in the <b>upper</b> troposphere/lower <b>stratosphere</b> region. The observational datasets we use are primarily climatologies developed from multiple years of observations. In the <b>upper</b> troposphere/lower <b>stratosphere</b> region, climatological distributions of lead- 210 were constructed from ~ 25 years of aircraft and balloon observations compiled into the US Environmental Measurements Laboratory RANDAB database. Taken as a whole, no simulation stands out as superior to the others. However, the simulation driven by the NCAR MACCM 3 meteorological data compares better with lead- 210 observations in the <b>upper</b> troposphere/lower <b>stratosphere</b> region. Comparisons of simulations made with and without convection show that {{the role played by}} convective transport and scavenging in the three simulations differs substantially.
