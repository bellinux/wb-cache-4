Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "If [...] can't resist the occasional fancy or cutesy flourishes... {{that tend to}} compromise his work, he still allows his material to exist on its own level and makes it fun to watch." [...] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote that the film was [...] "a deadly funny movie; nearly every scene is broken off with a punch line. But Parker's sense of comedy is organic; he never lets the jokes elbow the characters, or the music, out of the spotlight." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "... Parker has loosened <b>up</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> bit here, not forcing the action {{as much as he}} did in the similar Fame and bringing a surprisingly loony touch to characters like Jimmy's Elvis-obsessed father." [...] Time magazine reviewer Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "The film offers no message, no solutions, only a great time at the movies." ...|$|E

500|$|After the Magical Mystery Tour recordings, Evans flew to Nice with McCartney {{to shoot}} [...] "The Fool on the Hill" [...] promotional film, {{although}} McCartney set off without luggage or a passport. McCartney got past customs by saying [...] "You know who I am", {{but he and}} Evans were not allowed into a hotel restaurant in Nice because they [...] "didn't look the part", and had to eat dinner in Evans' room. Because the money they had with them had been spent on clothes (NEMS was supposed to send them more), they arranged for credit over two nights in a nightclub. Evans: [...] "We took advantage of our credit standing, as money had still not arrived from England. News about Paul's [...] visit to the club the previous night had spread, and the place was jammed. Now Paul, being a generous sort of person, had built <b>up</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> bar bill, when {{the manager of the}} club arrived demanding that we pay immediately. On explaining who Paul was and what had happened, he answered, 'You either pay the bill, or I call the police.' It certainly looked like {{we were going to get}} thrown in jail.

2500|$|PC Gamers Phil Savage {{praised the}} game's {{character}} interactions, noting that [...] "it's through these brief, unguarded conversations that the cyberpunk bartending sim slowly unfolds its story; {{not of a}} dystopian world, but of {{the people living in}} it." [...] Reviewing the game's prologue trailer, he added that [...] "it's an interesting concept, and well executed in what is—at this stage—a somewhat limited capacity." [...] Julian Benson of Kotaku wrote that [...] "Valhalla is a cocktail of game genres. It draws from visual novels, with each customer who visits your bar having a different story to tell. There's a healthy measure of Papers, Please, too, with you having to perform a mundane job (drink mixing) by following a complicated list of tasks. [...] And, on top of that you also get to manage and decorate your bar, so there's a dash of Animal Crossing for flavour." [...] He also quipped that [...] "year after year, nothing seems to slow the pace of successful cyberpunk bartender simulators." [...] Push Square's Nicola Hayden additionally added that [...] "gaining cult success around the more niche areas of the Internet, VA-11 HALL-A, a cyberpunk bartending simulator, has managed to stir <b>up</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> fuss."
