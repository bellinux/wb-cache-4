5|$|Watson, {{who grew}} up in Seattle in the 1920s and 1930s, was a tireless advocate, through his column as well as through a fictional {{organization}} he created called Lesser Seattle, for limiting the seemingly <b>unbridled</b> growth and urban renewal that dramatically altered the Seattle landscape {{during the second half of}} the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|In {{these years}} he {{recovered}} the manuscript {{that he and}} Thomas Young had worked in his youth from Young's widow, who was living in Albany, and began to develop it into the work that was published in 1785 as Reason: the Only Oracle of Man. The work was a typical Allen polemic, but its target was religious, not political. Specifically targeted against Christianity, it was an <b>unbridled</b> attack against the Bible, established churches, and {{the powers of the}} priesthood. As a replacement for organized religion, he espoused a mixture of deism, Spinoza's naturalist views, and precursors of Transcendentalism, with man acting as a free agent within the natural world. While historians disagree over the exact authorship of the work, the writing contains clear indications of Allen's style.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{had long}} wanted {{to develop a}} book of nursery rhymes, but such a project left Warne cold. Rhymes were already well {{represented}} in the firm's catalogue, and Warne felt Potter's <b>unbridled</b> enthusiasm for the genre would make the project a headache for him. In the past, {{he had tried to}} discourage Potter's interest in rhymes, believing her own stories superior, but she persisted. He reluctantly agreed to a book of rhymes for 1905, but Potter did not have it ready at the end of 1904, so he accepted the tea party tale instead. Early in 1905, it was decided the book would be published {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|The Joker {{possesses}} no superhuman abilities, instead {{using his}} expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions, and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy buzzers, and acid-spraying lapel flowers. The Joker sometimes works with other Gotham City supervillains {{such as the}} Penguin and Two-Face, and groups like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League, but these relationships often collapse due to the Joker's desire for <b>unbridled</b> chaos. The 1990s introduced a romantic interest for the Joker in his former psychiatrist, Harley Quinn, who becomes his villainous sidekick. Although his primary obsession is Batman, the Joker has also fought other heroes including Superman and Wonder Woman.|$|E
25|$|Binger was a horse man {{who played}} polo on weekends. He and Virginia took over {{operations}} of her father's Tartan Farm in Ocala, Florida, in 1974, and became its owners when Virginia's {{father died in}} 1978. During their stewardship, Tartan Farm bred 1980 Preakness Stakes winner Codex and 1990 three-year-old champion and Kentucky Derby winner <b>Unbridled.</b> The Bingers also bred and owned 1978 champion sprinter Dr. Patches, a son of McKnight's horse Dr. Fager. Tartan dispersed {{the majority of its}} horses at the 1987 Fasig-Tipton Kentucky November sale, including <b>Unbridled,</b> who sold as a weanling for $70,000.|$|E
25|$|Following My Sister, Life, Pasternak {{produced}} some hermetic pieces of uneven quality, including his masterpiece, the lyric cycle Rupture (1921). Both Pro-Soviet writers and their White emigre equivalents applauded Pasternak's poetry as pure, <b>unbridled</b> inspiration.|$|E

25|$|They have mistaken his <b>unbridled</b> {{vitality}} for insubordination; {{his native}} talent for pig iron; his abuse {{of beauty and}} pictorial authenticity for rebellious babble, and his refusal {{to sit in a}} rut like a melancholy and brooding Buddha, contemplating his umbilicus, as a downright menace.|$|E
25|$|Chen Qun {{once made}} many {{complaints}} about Guo Jia, saying how Guo very <b>unbridled</b> in his ways. Guo Jia, however, remained calm {{in the face}} of these accusations. Cao Cao still regarded Guo Jia highly but was also pleased that Chen Qun stood by his own principles.|$|E
25|$|Marino {{gave himself}} up to {{literary}} studies, love affairs and a life of pleasure so <b>unbridled</b> that he was arrested at least twice.

25|$|Today the vogue is for {{analysing}} {{and checking}} the most minute details, for comparing and contrasting rival theories, for reviving old and unexplored lines of enquiry {{in a new}} guise, and for an <b>unbridled</b> pluralism which mixes together erudition and extrapolation, and makes recourse to geology, history, prehistory, esotericism, religious history, mysticism, the paranormal, ufology and other fields.|$|E
25|$|Catherine I made Volynsky {{governor}} of Kazan {{for a short}} time, and he held the same post for two years (1728â€“1730) under Peter II. But his incurable corruption and <b>unbridled</b> temper so discredited the government that he was deprived of the post shortly after the accession of Anne. From 1730 to 1736 Volynsky served in the army under Munnich. In 1737 he was appointed the second Russian plenipotentiary at the abortive congress of Nemirov held for the conclusion of peace with the Porte.|$|E
25|$|From {{the innocence}} of childhood, to the flush of {{youthful}} overconfidence, through the trials and tribulations of middle age, to the hero's triumphant salvation, The Voyage of Life seems intrinsically linked to the Christian doctrine of death and resurrection. Cole's intrepid voyager also may {{be read as a}} personification of America, itself at an adolescent stage of development. The artist may have been issuing a dire warning to those caught up in the feverish quest for Manifest Destiny: that <b>unbridled</b> westward expansion and industrialization would have tragic consequences for both man and nature.|$|E

50|$|The filly was off {{the course}} {{for more than five}} months before reappearing in the Breeders' Cup Turf Sprint at Santa Anita on November 3. Ridden by Mike Smith she started at odds of 7/1 in a field of fourteen, with the three-year-old colt <b>Unbridled's</b> Note being made the 9/2 favorite. She was among the back markers for most of the way before moving five wide on the final turn to deliver her {{challenge}} in the straight. Midirection produced a strong late run on the outside to catch <b>Unbridled's</b> Note in the closing stages and won by half a length.|$|R

25|$|The party did not {{fare well}} {{in its first}} major test of {{national}} support, the 1895 general election. With the NAC taking a lead in organising the party's contests, and with finance tight just 28 candidates ran under the ILP banner. A special conference decided that support could be given to either ILP or SDF candidates, which brought a further four contests into the picture. None was elected, however, with even the popular party leader Keir Hardie going to defeat in a straight fight with the Conservatives. The electoral debacle of 1895 marked {{an end to the}} <b>unbridled</b> optimism which had attended the party's foundation.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Lai Min's old debating rival, Meng Guang, was as equally {{notorious for}} being <b>unbridled</b> {{in his speech}} and was, in some ways, worse than Lai Min in this regard. Meng Guang not only {{carelessly}} divulged state secrets (probably due to a slip of the tongue), but also discussed politics in an inappropriate setting. Nevertheless, both of them got off lightly because they held much prestige among the literati for their status as learned Confucian scholars. Lai Min, in particular, came from an elite family background and had previously served as an attendant to the Shu emperor Liu Shan when the emperor was still crown prince, therefore {{he was able to}} return to service every time after he got fired.|$|E
25|$|Egil (Egill)'s boyhood foreshadowed {{his future}} rebelliousness and poetic prowess. His <b>unbridled</b> {{behavior}} and strength beyond his age {{earned him a}} stay at home when a feast was held by Yngvar (Egil's maternal grandfather). Egil defiantly rode a horse to attend, and composed his first skaldic verse at age three. At {{the age of seven}} while playing in the ball games, he committed his first murder (axe-killing an older boy who outclassed him in the sport). By the time Egil was twelve very few grown men could compete with him in games, but when he and his friend challenged his father one day, Skallagrim manifested such strength at nightfall that he slammed the friend dead against the ground. Egil was so upset he killed one of his father's favorite workers, and the two were not on speaking terms.|$|E

25|$|Upadhyaya rejects Nehruvian {{economic}} policies and industrialization {{on the grounds}} that they were borrowed uncritically from the West, in disregard of the cultural and spiritual heritage of the country. There is a need, according to Upadhyaya, to strike a balance between the Indian and Western thinking in view of the dynamic nature of the society and the cultural heritage of the country. The Nehruvian model of economic development, emphasizing the increase of material wealth through rapid industrialization, promoted consumerism in Indian society. Not only has this ideology of development created social disparities and regional imbalances in economic growth, but it has failed to alleviate poverty in the country. The philosophy of integral humanism, like Gandhism, opposes <b>unbridled</b> consumerism, since such an ideology is alien to Indian culture. This traditional culture stresses putting restraints on one's desires and advocates contentment rather than ruthless pursuit of material wealth.|$|E
25|$|Despite his aloofness {{and cynical}} sense of humor, Mulder {{displays}} <b>unbridled</b> enthusiasm and interest {{when it comes}} to the paranormal, especially because of his personal involvement after his sister's abduction. Walter Skinner and other FBI officials have become concerned by his unprofessional behavior. This only proves true as Mulder makes a habit of letting his personal feelings cloud his judgment; his emotional attachment to UFO cases becomes more severe throughout the series, because of Dana Scully's eventual abduction and resultant cancer as well as his sister's abduction. Mulder can lose his temper when Scully is involved; on multiple occasions, he has become violent in his grief and unreserved in threatening physical force. Mulder's overprotectiveness of Scully stems not only from his obvious devotion and love for her, but also a long-harbored guilt; Mulder has admitted feeling indirectly responsible for the ordeals and tragedies Scully had gone through because of their investigations.|$|E
25|$|To {{make the}} {{comparison}} more obvious, the opera {{is set in}} a pseudo-Wild West America, with Mahagonny itself placed somewhere far from the rest of civilization. America was the land of <b>unbridled</b> capitalism, the frontier just as much so. The only difference is that bourgeois civility and civilization has yet to occupy the frontier, and thus there is no hiding the nature of capitalism beneath the facade of gentlemanly conduct. In Mahagonny, the characters are prostitutes, lumberjacks, criminals, and the like. Not one of them comes from the moneyed class, and yet the same system of exploitation was set up, but in a more naked manner. Instead of seducing a woman's love with power and influence, the residents of Mahagonny pay for a prostitute. But in Mahagonny, poverty is not just a condition the poor bring upon themselves, but a crime to be punished. Thus, Brecht and Weill tried to display capitalism as the meatgrinder they believed it to be.|$|E
50|$|As a two-year-old, <b>Unbridled's</b> Song {{may be most}} {{noted for}} his near-record time in the 1995 Breeders' Cup Juvenile. Trained by James T. Ryerson and ridden by Mike E.
