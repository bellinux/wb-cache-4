5|$|Building {{techniques}} {{that are more}} ductile than brittle, like the contained earth type of earthbag, or tire walls of earthships, may better avoid collapse than brittle <b>unreinforced</b> earth. Contained gravel base courses may add base isolation potential.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{constructed}} in double brick, {{and it is this}} <b>unreinforced</b> masonry construction that was unable to cope with the earthquake forces. Upstairs, windows were round-headed. Downstairs, many of the openings were French doors.|$|E
5|$|There are innumerable {{examples}} of mud brick or adobe building around the world. The walled city of Shibam in Yemen, designated a World Heritage Site in 1982, is known fr its ten-story <b>unreinforced</b> mud-brick buildings.|$|E
5|$|Following the event, a {{field survey}} was {{conducted}} along the fault zone {{with the goal of}} estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators. Ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed, both in the valley and in the foothills, with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in the epicentral area. The strong motion records that were acquired from the event were significant, and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event, and how it set a standard for those types of engineering or scientific papers. Repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of Bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving <b>unreinforced</b> masonry buildings.|$|E
5|$|Downtown Bakersfield {{was heavily}} {{impacted}} by the earthquakes, and many damaged buildings were bulldozed {{to make room for}} buildings that were eventually constructed with newer architectural styles. After World War II, and with a booming economy, the region was experiencing a period of urban renewal. The Kern County Courthouse, St. Francis Church, and the original Beale Memorial Clock Tower were all damaged and were leveled or rebuilt. In what may have been an overambitious push for renewal, some historic buildings that may have been able to be salvaged also were brought down, though some stood for many years after the earthquakes. Some of Bakersfield's <b>unreinforced</b> masonry buildings survived the shocks and were still in use years later, but the cost of retrofitting these buildings was often prohibitive for their owners, and the Bakersfield City Council was given the authority to seize or demolish them in 1993. The city changed its approach in the late 1990s after building owners complained that the upgrade process was too expensive, and the possibility that the city may be left in possession of properties that were left needing the costly renovations.|$|E
25|$|As {{discussed}} above, concrete is {{very strong}} in compression, but weak in tension. Larger earthquakes can generate very large shear loads on structures. These shear loads subject the structure to both tensile and compressional loads. Concrete structures without reinforcement, like other <b>unreinforced</b> masonry structures, can fail during severe earthquake shaking. <b>Unreinforced</b> masonry structures constitute {{one of the largest}} earthquake risks globally. These risks can be reduced through seismic retrofitting of at-risk buildings, (e.g. school buildings in Istanbul, Turkey).|$|E
25|$|Building {{codes in}} Santa Barbara were made more {{stringent}} {{after the earthquake}} demonstrated that traditional construction techniques of <b>unreinforced</b> concrete, brick, and masonry were unsafe and unlikely to survive strong temblors.|$|E
25|$|In {{the cities}} of Focșani and Buzău, <b>unreinforced</b> masonry walls in {{low-rise}} construction collapsed partially or totally, and {{there were signs of}} movement between structural elements and adjacent masonry in-fill walls in recently constructed engineered buildings.|$|E
25|$|The Eagle design sold {{in large}} numbers, but {{suffered}} many wing failures {{that resulted in}} several fatalities {{as a result of}} the deterioration of the <b>unreinforced</b> Dacron sailcloth trailing edge design. The lawsuits, {{as a result of the}} design defects, put the company out of business in about 1984, just as the market for ultralight aircraft in the United States collapsed.|$|E
25|$|Historic buildings, made of <b>unreinforced</b> masonry, {{may have}} {{culturally}} important interior detailing or murals {{that should not}} be disturbed. In this case, the solution may be to add a number of steel, reinforced concrete, or poststressed concrete columns to the exterior. Careful attention must be paid to the connections with other members such as footings, top plates, and roof trusses.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{reinforcement}} coupled with poor mortar and inadequate roof-to-wall ties {{can result in}} substantial damage to an <b>unreinforced</b> masonry building. Severely cracked or leaning walls {{are some of the}} most common earthquake damage. Also hazardous is the damage that may occur between the walls and roof or floor diaphragms. Separation between the framing and the walls can jeopardize the vertical support of roof and floor systems.|$|E
25|$|Application {{of modern}} {{technology}} to seismic retrofitting can enhance the survivability of <b>unreinforced</b> masonry structures. As an example, from 1973 to 1989, the Salt Lake City and County Building in Utah was exhaustively renovated and repaired {{with an emphasis on}} preserving historical accuracy in appearance. This was done in concert with a seismic upgrade that placed the weak sandstone structure on base isolation foundation to better protect it from earthquake damage.|$|E
25|$|Famous {{concrete}} structures {{include the}} Hoover Dam, the Panama Canal, and the Roman Pantheon. The earliest large-scale users of concrete technology were the ancient Romans, and concrete was {{widely used in}} the Roman Empire. The Colosseum in Rome was built largely of concrete, and the concrete dome of the Pantheon is the world's largest <b>unreinforced</b> concrete dome. Today, large concrete structures (for example, dams and multi-storey car parks) are usually made with reinforced concrete.|$|E
25|$|The largest dome in {{the world}} for more than 1,700 years was the Pantheon in Rome. Its {{concrete}} dome spans an interior space of 43.45m, which corresponds exactly to its height from floor to top. Its apex concludes with an 8.95m wide oculus. The structure remained unsurpassed until 1881 and stills holds the title of the largest <b>unreinforced</b> solid concrete dome {{in the world}}. The Pantheon has exercised an immense influence on Western dome construction to this day.|$|E
25|$|On January 17, the {{campaign}} to conquer Málaga began when the newly constituted Army of the South under Queipo de Llano advanced from the west and soldiers led by Colonel Antonio Muñoz Jiménez attacked from the northeast. Both attacks encountered little resistance and made advances of up to 15 miles in a week. The Republicans failed {{to realize that the}} Nationalists were concentrating for an attack on Málaga and thus they remained <b>unreinforced</b> and unprepared for the main attack on February 3.|$|E
25|$|The main shock on 4 September caused {{widespread}} {{damage and}} several power outages, {{particularly in the}} city of Christchurch, New Zealand's second largest city. Two residents were seriously injured, one by a collapsing chimney and a second by flying glass. One person {{died of a heart attack}} suffered during the quake, although this could not be directly linked to the earthquake. Mass fatalities were avoided partly due to there being few houses of <b>unreinforced</b> construction, although this was also aided by the quake occurring during the early hours of the morning when most people were off the street.|$|E
25|$|The Fort de Chaudfontaine, {{also called}} the Fort de la Rochette, is one of twelve forts built {{as part of the}} fortifications of Liège in the late 19th century in Belgium. It was built between 1881 and 1884 {{according}} to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières, the fort was built exclusively of <b>unreinforced</b> concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. The fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Liège. The fort is now used as an adventure park.|$|E
25|$|The {{affected}} {{area has}} a low population density and has an abundance of homes that are constructed with local clay material by unskilled workers. The <b>unreinforced</b> stone masonry or adobe homes are sometimes overloaded single story structures with flat wooden roofs with steel beams. Most {{of these types of}} homes suffered partial collapse, and led to a number of roof collapses. Fifty homes were destroyed, three-hundred were damaged, including a roof cave-in that left two women dead. Overall, seven villages sustained damage and twelve were destroyed. Four people died, forty were injured, and 800 were left homeless, but no major infrastructure (dams, bridges, or power stations) were impacted.|$|E
25|$|The Fort de Liers is one {{of twelve}} forts built {{as part of the}} fortifications of Liège in the late 19th century in Belgium. It was built between 1881 and 1884 {{according}} to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières, the fort was built exclusively of <b>unreinforced</b> concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. The fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Liège. Liers was never upgraded like the other forts of Liège. It is now used as a test site for aircraft engines and is not accessible to the public.|$|E
25|$|There was {{widespread}} damage to <b>unreinforced</b> masonry {{structures in the}} Helena area with more than 200 chimneys being destroyed. The strongest effects were seen in the northeast, where buildings were constructed on alluvial soil, and in the southern business district, which contained many brick buildings. The most extensively damaged building was the Helena High School, which was completed in August 1935 and had just been dedicated in early October. The school buildings, which had cost $500,000, had not been designed to be earthquake resistant. Another building that was totally destroyed {{and had to be}} rebuilt was the Lewis and Clark County Hospital. The October 18 earthquake caused an estimated $3 million of damage to property.|$|E
25|$|Although many {{structures}} {{have undergone}} seismic retrofitting {{there are a}} large number of dangerous <b>unreinforced</b> masonry (mostly brick) structures and chimneys, which can be extremely hazardous to occupants in a large earthquake, and {{a large number of}} buildings which are either not bolted to their foundations or which are elevated upon partial stories that are insufficiently resistant to shear forces. Foundation and partial story weaknesses are easily remediated in most cases, but this is only effective if the work is competently done, with proper attention to minor details such as nailing patterns and proper connections. Local surveys of recently completed work have exposed deficient workmanship in a number of cases involving household retrofits.|$|E
25|$|The Fort de Hollogne is one {{of twelve}} forts built {{as part of the}} fortifications of Liège in the late 19th century in Belgium. It was built between 1881 and 1884 {{according}} to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières, the fort was built exclusively of <b>unreinforced</b> concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. The fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Liège. Hollogne was never upgraded like the other forts of Liège and retains its character as a Brialmont fort. It is preserved as a museum and may be visited by the public.|$|E
25|$|The {{derailment}} {{occurred when}} the layers of colloidal clay and gravel in the embankment that had been cut into the hill gave way. Shortly afterwards, a mixed train consisting of a locomotive and ten cars came down the tracks, falling down the embankment and landing on the road below. Of the passengers and crew on board that night, 41 people were injured and at least 42 were killed or died later from injuries sustained in the crash. It is unclear how many died in the derailment {{compared to those who}} died in the blaze that followed it. Many of the passengers were burned alive as the <b>unreinforced</b> wooden cars caught fire, killing those who had survived the crash itself but were still trapped in the wreckage.|$|E
25|$|The Fort d'Emines {{is one of}} nine forts {{built as}} part of the Fortifications of Namur in the late 19th century in Belgium. It was built between 1888 and 1892 {{according}} to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières, the fort was built exclusively of <b>unreinforced</b> concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. In 1914 the fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Namur. Unlike seven of the nine Namur forts, Émines was never upgraded {{to become part of the}} fortified position of Namur. Instead, it became a supply and munitions depot. The fort is now abandoned on private property.|$|E
25|$|The Fort de Fléron is one {{of twelve}} forts built {{as part of the}} Fortifications of Liège in the late 19th century in Belgium. It was built between 1881 and 1891 {{according}} to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières, the fort was built exclusively of <b>unreinforced</b> concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. The fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Liège. Fléron was upgraded in the 1930s {{to become part of the}} fortified position of Liège in an attempt to forestall or slow an attack from Germany. Located in the center of Fléron, the fort has been buried and is surrounded by apartments.|$|E
25|$|In {{many parts}} of {{developing}} countries such as Pakistan, Iran and China, <b>unreinforced</b> {{or in some cases}} reinforced masonry is the predominantly form of structures for rural residential and dwelling. Masonry was also a common construction form {{in the early part of}} the 20th century, which implies that a substantial number of these at-risk masonry structures would have significant heritage value. Masonry walls that are not reinforced are especially hazardous. Such structures may be more appropriate for replacement than retrofit, but if the walls are the principal load bearing elements in structures of modest size they may be appropriately reinforced. It is especially important that floor and ceiling beams be securely attached to the walls. Additional vertical supports in the form of steel or reinforced concrete may be added.|$|E
25|$|In Santa Cruz, {{close to}} the epicenter, 40 {{buildings}} collapsed, killing six people. At the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, the Plunge Building was significantly damaged. Liquefaction also caused damage in the Watsonville area. For example, sand volcanoes formed in a field near Pajaro {{as well as in}} a strawberry field. The Ford's department store in Watsonville experienced significant damage, including a crack down the front of the building. Many homes were dislodged if they were not bolted to their foundations. There were structural failures of twin bridges across Struve Slough near Watsonville. In Moss Landing, the liquefaction destroyed the causeway that carried the Moss Beach access road across tidewater basin, damaged the approach and abutment of the bridge linking Moss Landing spit to the mainland and cracked the paved road on Paul's Island. In the Old Town historical district of the city of Salinas, <b>unreinforced</b> masonry buildings were partially destroyed.|$|E
25|$|As the Laotian Civil War flared, the Central Intelligence Agency {{established}} a secret guerrilla {{army in the}} Plain of Jars. Interposed between the communist settlement around Xam Neua and the Royal Lao Government in Vientiane, the Hmong military irregulars fought {{to hold on to}} their traditional territory, and to preserve Laos. After the failure and defeat of Operation Pigfat and Operation Raindance in early 1969, the communists had overrun the Plain of Jars to within ten kilometers of the guerrillas' main base at Long Chieng. As a riposte, Hmong General Vang Pao plotted another spoiling offensive against the pressing communists. However, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) beat him to it with Campaign Thoan Thang. After the Vietnamese campaign ran its course, Vang Pao launched yet another inconclusive offensive that failed to clear the foe from the Plain of Jars, Operation Off Balance. By 28 June 1969, the PAVN had 60 tanks deployed. Additionally, there were seven new Vietnamese infantry battalions poised on the Plain, while the Royalist remained <b>unreinforced.</b> The PAVN now had a total of 26 battalions in the Plain of Jars area, seemingly poised for a further wet season offensive.|$|E
25|$|Stone, {{brick and}} other such {{materials}} are strong in compression and somewhat so in shear, but cannot resist much force in tension. As a result, masonry arch bridges {{are designed to be}} constantly under compression, so far as is possible. Each arch is constructed over a temporary falsework frame, known as a centring. In the first compression arch bridges, a keystone {{in the middle of the}} bridge bore the weight of the rest of the bridge. The more weight that was put onto the bridge, the stronger its structure became. Masonry arch bridges use a quantity of fill material (typically compacted rubble) above the arch in order to increase this dead-weight on the bridge and prevent tension from occurring in the arch ring as loads move across the bridge. Other materials that were used to build this type of bridge were brick and <b>unreinforced</b> concrete. When masonry (cut stone) is used the angles of the faces are cut to minimize shear forces. Where random masonry (uncut and unprepared stones) is used they are mortared together and the mortar is allowed to set before the falsework is removed.|$|E
25|$|A second kind of {{experiment}} resembles the ordinary double-slit experiment. The schematic diagram of this experiment {{shows that a}} lens {{on the far side}} of the double slits makes the path from each slit diverge slightly from the other after they cross each other fairly near to that lens. The result is that at the two wavefunctions for each photon will be in superposition within a fairly short distance from the double slits, and if a detection screen is provided within the region wherein the wavefunctions are in superposition then interference patterns will be seen. There is no way by which any given photon could have been determined to have arrived from one or the other of the double slits. However, if the detection screen is removed the wavefunctions on each path will superimpose on regions of lower and lower amplitudes, and their combined probability values will be much less than the <b>unreinforced</b> probability values at the center of each path. When telescopes are aimed to intercept the center of the two paths, there will be equal probabilities of nearly 50% that a photon will show up in one of them. When a photon is detected by telescope 1, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the lower slit. When one is detected in telescope 2, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the upper slit. The explanation that supports this interpretation {{of experiment}}al results is that a photon has emerged from one of the slits, and that is the end of the matter. A photon must have started at the laser, passed through one of the slits, and arrived by a single straight-line path at the corresponding telescope.|$|E

On Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas, the hurricane produced an estimated storm surge of up to [...] The surge, combined with incoming waves, caused extensive flooding in the park and damaged numerous docks. In spite of this, property damage was minimal in the area, totaling $160,000.|$|E
500|$|Many wooden {{cafes and}} shops within [...] of the shore were {{completely}} removed by the tsunami at Pangandaran, and severe damage still occurred to <b>unreinforced</b> masonry that was within several hundred meters, but some hotels that were constructed well held up better.

Other severe damage was seen at Marsawah village, Bulakbenda, where all buildings had been removed down to their foundation within [...] of the water line, and even [...] further inland there were many buildings that were totally destroyed. Witnesses reported that waves were breaking several hundred meters inland at that location.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} phase, after {{determining}} {{that the proposed}} weight of the monument was too great for the old foundation to safely bear, {{the thickness of the}} walls atop the unfinished stump was reduced and the foundation was strengthened by adding a large <b>unreinforced</b> concrete slab below the perimeter of the old foundation to increase the monument's load bearing area two and one half times. The slab was [...] thick, with an outer perimeter [...] square, an inner perimeter [...] square, with undisturbed loam inside the inner perimeter except for the water well. The area {{at the base of the}} second phase foundation is [...] The strengthened foundation (old foundation and concrete slab) has a total depth of [...] below the bottom of the lowest course of marble blocks (now below ground), and [...] below the entry lobby floor. Casey reported that nowhere did the load exceed [...] and did not exceed [...] near the outer perimeter. To properly distribute the load from the shaft to slab, about half by volume of the outer periphery of the old rubble foundation below its top step was removed. A continuous sloping <b>unreinforced</b> concrete buttress encircles what remains. The buttress is [...] square at its base, [...] square at its top, and [...] high. The perimeter of the original top step of the old rubble foundation rests on the larger top of the concrete buttress. Its slope (lower external angle from the vertical) is 49°. This buttress rests in a depression (triangular cross-section) on the top surface of the concrete slab. The slab was constructed by digging pairs of [...] wide drifts on opposite sides of the monument's center line to keep the monument properly balanced. The drifts were filled with <b>unreinforced</b> concrete with depressions or dowel stones on their sides to interlock the sections. An earthen terrace [...] wide with its top at the base of the walls and steep sides was constructed in 1880–81 over the reinforced foundation while the rest of the monument was being constructed. During 1887–88, a knoll was constructed around the terrace tapering out roughly [...] onto the surrounding terrain. This earthen terrace and knoll serves as an additional buttress for the foundation. The weight of the foundation is , including earth and gneiss rubble above the concrete foundation that is within its outer perimeter.|$|E
500|$|The {{cornerstone}} {{was laid}} {{at what is}} now Building 60 on May 14, 1887, {{which would have been}} Leland Stanford Junior's 19th birthday. [...] The Inner Quad was mostly finished (except for the church) by the time the university opened in 1891. [...] The Outer Quad and Memorial Church were completed by 1906, but the entire structure was severely damaged in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Restoration of the Quad began immediately, but several original features of the Quad that collapsed in the earthquake were never rebuilt: the huge Memorial Arch over the entrance to Memorial Court, and a spire on Memorial Church. The Quad, which was originally built of <b>unreinforced</b> masonry, has been seismically retrofitted several times since then.|$|E
500|$|Calculations {{based on}} fault length and paleoseismological {{studies show that}} the Seattle Fault can {{generate}} a very damaging magnitude 7.0 earthquake.
