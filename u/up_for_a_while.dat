The pair teamed <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> as The Frat Boys, and later The Frat Pack, but they had disbanded by late March 2007. Mondo moved into singles competition, and picked up wins over Steve Lewington, Boris Alexiev, and Colt Cabana, among others. In June 2007, he started a feud with Shawn Spears over the OVW Television Championship, but failed to capture it on several occasions. A one-night reunion with Nemeth followed, before he began dubbing himself [...] "The Professional" [...] Mike Mondo and began feuding with Atlas DaBone.|$|E

2500|$|At work, Ambrose again serves Dan, {{who had an}} {{argument}} with Nicola whilst viewing another flat. It now transpires that Dan {{used to have a}} promising career in the Army, but was dismissed after the men he was responsible for committed some undisclosed atrocity. Although Dan accepts that what his men did was wrong and, as the only officer present, he should carry the can, he appears to be in denial about his share of the responsibility. [...] Vaguely referring to a past relationship, Ambrose suggests that the solution may be for Dan to, at least temporarily, meet other women. Dan returns home drunk again, and this time, the row escalates and Dan mentions they break <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> exactly how Ambrose suggested. Feigning indifference, Nicola accepts, saying she may also meet someone else.|$|E

However, on July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker announced via the band's official website {{that the two}} were leaving the band. In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, {{what do you want}} to do?' and I said, 'Well, I think it might be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was going to say the same thing,'" [...] Ross recalled. [...] "And there was really no argument, which is really the best way that could've worked out." [...] Ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and Urie. Urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound, while Ross – and, by extension, Walker – was interested in making retro-inspired rock.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was said}} that those {{ancestors}} were on the Long Walk with their daughter, who was pregnant and about to give birth [...] the daughter got tired and weak and couldn't {{keep up with the}} others or go further because of her condition. So my ancestors asked the Army to hold <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> and to let the woman give birth, but the soldiers wouldn't do it. They forced my people to move on, saying that they were getting behind the others. The soldier told the parents that they had to leave their daughters behind. [...] "Your daughter is not going to survive, anyway; sooner or later she is going to die," [...] they said in their own language. [...] "Go ahead," [...] the daughter said to her parents, [...] "things might come out all right with me," [...] But the poor thing was mistaken, my grandparents used to say. Not long after they had moved on, they heard a gunshot from where they had been a short time ago.|$|E

2500|$|On July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker {{announced}} via the band's {{official website}} {{that the two}} were leaving the band. The statement, in part, read: [...] "Ryan Ross and Jon Walker will be leaving Panic at the Disco {{to embark on a}} musical excursion of their own. Though the four of us have made music together in the past, we’ve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve. Over the years, we have remained close and honest with each other, which helped us to realize that our goals were different and that parting ways is truly what is best for each of us."
