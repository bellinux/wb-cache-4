Erect plant {{architecture}} is usually preferred by farmers but results in late and scarce flowering, which slows down breeding and genetic studies. The objective {{of this study was}} to induce earlier and more abundant flowering, which have become key research needs for cassava. Six non- or late-flowering genotypes were selected for grafting on a profuse, early flowering <b>understock.</b> Grafted stems did not branch and flower while attached to the <b>understock.</b> Four cuttings from each grafted stem were taken and planted the following season. Paired-row cuttings from non-grafted stems of the same genotypes were planted as checks. Three phenotypic responses to grafting were found. One genotype failed to branch and flower, independently of the origin of the cuttings. Four genotypes branched but did not produce flowers. However, plants from grafted cuttings tended to branch earlier, particularly after the second branching event. Finally, in one genotype, grafting induced not only earlier branching but also earlier and more abundant production of flowers, fruits and seeds than their counterparts of plants from non-grafted stems. This is the first report of grafting effects on the induction of earlier flowering in cassava.

40|$|Nonstationary {{stochastic}} {{demand and}} random supply yield {{have led to}} a great challenge in construction material management. Appropriate safety stocks can cope with uncertainty in both demand and supply yield, and improve the construction cost and productivity significantly. But the safety stock is usually determined by planner's experience or rough evaluation in management practice, which results in overstock or <b>understock</b> situations frequently. For changing this situation, this paper focuses on analysis of the stochastic inventory control problem of construction material, and develops a general safety-stock determination approach under nonstationary stochastic demand and random supply yield. Based on the linear-order release rule and modified base-stock definition, the inventory balance equation is developed. Then, a coverage random variable, which incorporates the complete information of outstanding orders, is defined to represent the outflows and inflows to stock over risk periods. Meanwhile, the fixed-point iteration method is adopted to calculate the time-varying safety-stock level under predefined service-level (nonstockout probability) constraint. Finally, a numerical analysis is conducted to investigate the relative performance of the proposed safety-stock approach and days of supply rule. The result demonstrates a considerable service improvement and inventory decrease of the safety-stock approach. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|E
40|$|Consider a {{firm that}} sells {{products}} over repeated seasons, each of which includes a full-price period and a markdown period. The firm may deliberately <b>understock</b> products in the markdown period to induce high-value customers to purchase early at full price. Customers cannot perfectly anticipate availability. Instead, they use observed past capacities to form capacity expectations according to a heuristic smoothing rule. Based on their expectations of capacity, customers decide to buy either in the full-price period or in the markdown period. We embed this customer learning process in a dynamic program of the firm's capacity choices over time. One main result demonstrates {{the existence of a}} monotone optimal path of customers' expectations, which converges to either a rationing equilibrium or a low-price-only equilibrium. Further, there exists a critical value of capacity expectation such that the market converges to a rationing equilibrium if customers' initial expectations are less than that critical value; otherwise, a low-price-only equilibrium is the limiting outcome. These results show how firms can be stuck with unprofitable selling strategies from incumbent customer expectations. We also examine numerically how this critical value is affected by the firm's discount factor and customers' learning speed and risk aversion. Last, we show that the equilibrium under adaptive learning converges to that under rational expectations as the firm's discount factor approaches one. consumer behavior, pricing and revenue management, dynamic programming...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the impact of}} supply-side {{externalities}} existing among downstream retailers on supply chain performance. Namely, multiple retail firms face stochastic demand, purchase the product from the upstream wholesaler, and make stocking decisions that affect all other retailers in the same echelon. Two sources of inefficiencies exist in such a supply chain: One is double marginalization {{and the other is}} externalities among retailers. Whereas double marginalization always leads to inventory understocking at the retail echelon, we find that the implications of externalities are more complex, because different externalities can improve or deteriorate supply chain performance, relative to the situation without externalities. We show that the effect of externalities depends critically on whether the stocking decisions of retailers exhibit positive (complementarity) or negative (substitutability) externalities, and whether retailers are managed centrally or competitively. Under complementarity, competing retailers tend to <b>understock</b> the product (compared with the centralized inventory management at the retail level), thus aggravating the double-marginalization effect. This is the opposite of what happens under substitutability, where competing retailers tend to overstock the product, thus compensating for the double-marginalization effect. Hence, we conclude that supply chain coordination between retailers and the wholesaler is most important when there is downstream competition that exhibits complementarity. From the wholesaler's point of view, competition among retailers is preferable over centralization of retailers when externalities are negative, and vice versa when externalities are positive. Moreover, with competition on complements, both retailers and the wholesaler have incentives to coordinate the supply chain. supply chain, game theory, competition, Nash equilibrium, complementarity, supermodularity...|$|E

3000|$|Limitations {{and future}} areas of {{research}} The limitations of our model point {{to a variety of}} future {{areas of research}}. We follow the general literature on shelf-space management and assume a deterministic and stationary demand for the tactical problem. Because of this, demand is always satisfied. Hence, one area is to further generalize the demand modeling. Some authors argue that demand volatility can be handled with exogenously determined safety stocks. The resulting shelf space for the safety stock needs to be deducted from the total shelf space and only the remaining space can be distributed. However, our modeling approach has the advantage of being flexible enough to determine safety stocks endogenously. As safety stocks protect against uncertainty in demand (demand volatility) and supply (lead time volatility), the impact of both decision variables (i.e., the impact of the number of facings on the demand and the impact of the order frequency on supply) need to be taken into account. Hence, for all precalculated combinations of the decisions variables, one can calculate the safety stocks accordingly within the model. Furthermore, our model and solution approach is a good starting point to account for further demand effects. Focusing on demand volatility would imply the development of a stochastic model for our decision problem with replenishment costs to account for demand variations (cf. e.g., Hübner and Schaal 2016 a). In such cases, out-of-stock substitutions resulting from potentially insufficient shelf and backroom quantities for specific items would need to be taken into consideration as well (cf. e.g., Kök and Fisher 2007; Hübner et al. 2016). A stochastic model would need to balance the trade-offs between <b>understock</b> and overstock situations, which is specifically relevant in the case of perishable items. These additional costs can be included in the precalculations. Apart from stochastic demand, further demand effects, such as item positioning (cf. e.g., Lim et al. 2004; Bianchi-Aguiar et al. 2015 b) or cross-space elasticities (cf. e.g., Corstjens and Doyle 1981), would be worth considering when the model is applied to certain categories with these demand effects.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of products from manufacturer to distributor to wholesaler {{and finally to}} retailer (the Supply Chain) exhibits surprisingly erratic behavior, popularly termed the Bullwhip Effect. Recently a group at the Santa Fe Institute's Business Network formed a team to study the Bullwhip effect via John Sterman's classic Operations Research game called the Beer Game. One of our goals was to discover mechanisms that would "dampen " the chaotic behavior, selforganizing the system into a stable one. Two mechanisms were investigated: increasing the visibility {{up and down the}} supply chain for each member of the chain, and converting the chain from a linear form to a network or mesh form. Both effects provided a simple Self-Organized network where improvements in individual choices dampened the variations in the overall chain. History While investigating the dynamics of supply chains in the 1980 's, researchers were surprised to find that presumably stable commodities exhibited surprisingly chaotic inventory properties. Demand for these products, rather than being constant, varied considerably, and the associated Supply (inventory at the manufacturer and warehouses) fell into uncontrolled erratic behavior. [4] diapers would provide a nearly constant demand, and the associated supply chain would be quite stable and predictable. Studies showed, however, that the pampers supply chain showed highly erratic, chaotic behavior. MIT's John Sterman[5] invented a simple supply chain board game, called the Beer Game, where four players managed inventory in a four level supply chain: Beer Factory, Distributor, Wholesaler and Retailer. Each turn of the game represented one week's ordering and receiving of inventory into stock. A two-week supply queue, and a one-week ordering queue, existed between each player, introducing delay and uncertainty. The "customer " for this supply chain had simple behavior in every play of the game: buy 4 barrels of beer each week for four weeks, then buy 8 barrels from then on, thus introducing a simple step function for customer demand. Players attempt to minimize a cost function based on $. 50 per barrel for storage, suffering a $ 2. 00 per barrel penalty for having inventory reduced to zero, thus not being able to fulfill orders (<b>understock)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|In a {{merchandise}} depth test, {{a retail}} chain introduces new products {{at a small}} sample of selected stores for a short period prior to the primary selling season and uses the observed sales to forecast demand for the entire chain. We describe a method for resolving two key questions in merchandise testing: (1) which stores to use for the test and (2) how to extrapolate from test sales to create a forecast of total season demand for each product for the chain. Our method uses sales history of products sold in a prior season, similar to those to be tested, to devise a testing program that would have been optimal if it had been applied to this historical sample. is defined as minimizing the cost of conducting the test, plus the cost of over- and understocking of the products whose supply is to be guided by the test. To determine the best set of test stores, we apply a -median model to cluster the stores of the chain based on a store similarity measure defined by sales history, and then choose one test store from each cluster. A linear programming model is used to fit a formula that is then used to predict total sales from test sales. We applied our method at a large retailer that specializes in women's apparel and at two major shoe retailers, comparing results in each case to the existing process used by the apparel retailer and to some standard statistical approaches such as forward selection and backward elimination. We also tested a version of our method in which clustering was based on a combination of several store descriptors such as location, type of store, ethnicity of the neighborhood of location, total store sales, and average temperature of the store location. We found that relative to these other methods, our approach could significantly improve forecasts and reduce markdowns that result from excessive inventory, and lost margins resulting from stockouts. At the apparel retailer the improvement was enough to increase profits by more than 100 %. We believe that one reason our method outperforms the forward selection and backward elimination methods is that these methods seek to minimize squared errors, while our method optimizes the true cost of forecast errors. In addition, our approach, which is based purely on sales, outperforms descriptor variables because it is not always clear which are the best store descriptors and how best to combine them. However, the sales-based process is completely objective and directly corresponds to the retailer's objective of minimizing the <b>understock</b> and overstock costs of forecast error. We examined the stores within each of the clusters formed by our method to identify common factors that might explain their similar sales patterns. The main factor was the similarity in climate within a cluster. This was followed by the ethnicity of the neighborhood where the store is located, and the type of store. We also found that, contrary to popular belief, store size and location had little impact on sales patterns. In addition, this technique could also be used to determine the inventory allocation to individual stores within a cluster and to minimize lost demand resulting from inaccurate distribution across size. Finally, our method provides a logical framework for implementing micromerchandising, a practice followed by a significant number of retailers in which a unique assortment of merchandise is offered in each store (or a group of similar stores) tuned to maximize the appeal to customers of that store. Each cluster formed by our algorithm could be treated as a "virtual chain" within the larger chain, which is managed separately and in a consistent manner in terms of product mix, timing of delivery, advertising message, and store layout.

Na analise desses experimentos, utiliza-se a teoria de modelos lineares generalizados, bastante difundida (McCullagh & Nelder, 1989; Demetrio, 2001), em que as respostas sao independentes. Caso a variancia estimada seja maior do que a esperada, estima-se o parametro de dispersao, incluindo-o no processo de estimaçao dos parametros. Quando a variavel resposta e observada ao longo do tempo, pode haver uma correlacao entre as observacoes e isso tem que ser levado em consideracao na estimacao dos parametros.

Uma outra alternativa e a inclusao, no preditor linear, de um efeito latente para captar variabilidades nao consideradas no modelo e que podem in uenciar nos resultados.

Experiments which {{response}} variables are proportions or counts are {{very common in}} several research areas, specially {{in the area of}} agriculture. The theory of generalized linear models, well difused (McCullagh & Nelder, 1989; Demetrio, 2001), is used for analyzing these experiments where the responses are independent. If the estimated variance is greater than the expected variance, the dispersion parameter is estimated including it on the parameter estimation process. When the response variable is observed over time a correlation among observations might occur and it should be taken into account in the parameter estimation. A way of dealing with this correlation is applying the methodology of generalized estimating equations (GEEs) discussed by Liang & Zeger (1986) although, in this case, the interest is on the estimates of the xed efect being the inclusion of a working correlation matrix useful to obtain more accurate estimates. Another alternative is the inclusion of a latent efect in the linear predictor to explain variabilities not considered in the model that might in uence the results. In this work the random efect and the dispersion parameter are combined and included together in the parameter estimation. Such methodology is applied to a data set obtained from an experiment realized with camu-camu to evaluate, through proportion of grafting well successful of seedling, which kind of grafting and <b>understock</b> are suitable to be used. Several models are fitted, since the split plot model (with independence assumption) up to the model where the dispersion parameter and the random efect are considered together. There is evidence that the model including the random efect and the dispersion parameter together, produce better estimates of the parameters. Another longitudinal data set used here comes from an experiment realized with the MON 810 transgenic corn where the response variable is the number of caterpillars (Spodoptera frugiperda). In this case, due to the excessive number of zeros obtained, the zero in ated Poisson regression model (ZIP) is used in addition to the standard Poisson model, where observations are considered independent, and the zero in ated Poisson regression model with random efect. The results show that the random efect included in the linear predictor was not significant and, therefore, the adopted model is the zero in ated Poisson regression model.

The overall reproduction of oaks was relatively poor (an average of 340 per acre and less than 20 percent milacre plot stocking) and cherrybark, Shumard, and swamp chestnut oak reproduction was probably not sufficient to recover their proportions that existed in the preharvest overstory. Water/willow oaks were more successful than the other oaks and may attain equal or higher levels in the future stand compared to the preharvest overstory. <b>Understocked</b> areas in the patches resulted primarily from development of heavy woody vine and shrub cover, with grapevine the most important problem. The eight-year stocking of oaks originated primarily from advance reproduction less than one foot tall and from post harvest germination of acorns. The contribution of large advance oak reproduction was very small, due to the very low numbers present before harvest...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop an}} {{equilibrium}} {{model of a}} closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network with multiproducts, uncertain demands, and returns. This model belongs to the context of oligopolistic firms that compete noncooperatively in a Cournot-Nash framework under a stochastic environment. To satisfy the demands, we use two different channels: manufacturing new products and remanufacturing returned products through recycling used components. Since both the demands and product returns are uncertain, we consider two types of risks: overstocking and <b>understocking</b> of multiproducts in the forward supply chain. Then we set up the Cournot-Nash equilibrium conditions of the CLSC network whereby we maximize every oligopolistic firm's expected profit by deciding the production quantities of each new product {{as well as the}} path flows of each product on the forward supply chain. Furthermore, we formulate the Cournot-Nash equilibrium conditions of the CLSC network as a variational inequality and prove the existence and the monotonicity of the variational inequality. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency of our model. Department of Applied Mathematic...|$|R
3000|$|Although {{the fact}} that fire {{has always been an}} {{important}} ecological factor is recognized to a certain extent by most foresters, many of them disregard or minimize the possibility of utilizing fire as a silvicultural agent in the management of ponderosa pine forests. They refer to the past fire history of the stand as “the process of attrition” and assume that the magnificent, open pine forests found by the first white man on entering this region were but <b>understocked,</b> patchy stands, “worn down by the attrition of repeated light fires.” In the dense stands of reproduction that have come in as a “veritable blanket” under the mature stands since the advent of fire protection, they see proof of this interpretation. Show and Kotok [1924], for example, state that, “This remarkable change is in itself proof that the virgin forest as we find it does not represent the productive capacity of the land, for if an area of ground is fully occupied by a mature crop of timber the young individuals cannot obtain a foothold because the available moisture and light are fully utilized.” [...]...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} in supply chains where {{retailer}} effort can substantially affect sales, longer leadtimes can result in higher sales for the manufacturer. Hence, under such conditions, manufacturers {{might not want to}} reduce lead times even if it was free to do so. Using a one-period model where retailer effort affects sales and is exerted after stocking quantities are determined, manufacturers and retailers have a price-only contract, leadtime from the manufacturer to retailer could be reduced to zero at no additional cost, and there is no competition (i. e., the retailer and manufacturer have exclusive contracts), we still find conditions under which manufacturers are better off sticking to longer leadtimes. If, in addition to the previous assumptions, demand follows the uniform distribution, the wholesale price is exogenously determined, and overstocking cost is equal to <b>understocking</b> cost, we show that the manufacturer will always prefer longer lead times. Next, we examine alternate contract forms, and their impact on manufacturer retailer incentives. Our paper highlights how supply chain contracts could act as a potential barrier to reducing leadtimes from manufacturers to distributors, and offers alternate contract forms {{that could be used to}} overcome this barrier...|$|R
40|$|Data envelopment {{analysis}} (DEA) {{was used}} to benchmark extensive sheep operations in Laingsburg in the Central Karoo, South Africa, with data from the 2012 production season. An input oriented variable returns to scale frontier identified twelve efficient firms, and nine more that are technically efficient but not scale efficient. The top third’s overall efficiency score was 0. 999. For the bottom third the average efficiency score was just 0. 346, which indicates that there is substantial room for improvement amongst bottom third producers in this production system. Overall efficiency was correlated with stocking density, flock size, unit production cost and profitability, cumulative family experience of farming {{and the use of}} family labour, but not with farm size, breed choice or any proxy for individual experience or ability. Predation rates in particular were uncorrelated with productivity scores and reproductive performance was only weakly correlated with it. While most farms could theoretically improve their efficiency by intensifying their operations, a closer analysis of best practice firms revealed a spectrum of optimal intensities including the possibility of restoring rangelands by deliberate <b>understocking.</b> Grazing strategy and the degree of labour self-sufficiency emerged as the key determinants of optimal intensity...|$|R
