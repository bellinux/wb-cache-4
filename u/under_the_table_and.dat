5|$|Dave Matthews Band is an American rock band, {{formed in}} Charlottesville, Virginia in 1991 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Matthews. Other band members include bassist Stefan Lessard, violinist Boyd Tinsley, and drummer Carter Beauford. In November 1990, Matthews {{became friends with}} a lawyer named Ross Hoffman while a {{bartender}} in Charlottesville. Hoffman convinced Matthews to create a demo album of a few songs that he had written. Matthews then shared the demo with other musicians, including Beauford and Moore. Both of them, who were jazz musicians at the time, joined Matthews after hearing the demo. The band has released eight studio albums, all with RCA Records: <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> <b>and</b> Dreaming (1994), Crash (1996), Before These Crowded Streets (1998), Everyday (2001), Busted Stuff (2002), Stand Up (2005), Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King (2009), Away from the World (2012). They have sold over 31 million albums in the United States, making them {{one of the top}} 100 highest-selling music acts of all-time.|$|E
5|$|The {{first full}} day of filming on June 23 was {{predominantly}} shot on the set representing {{the bridge of the}} Enterprise. Two small establishing shots were postponed until the filming of the next episode. The following day, corridor scenes were filmed, as was the climactic scene featuring the creature's death. At that point, Daniels estimated that he was only a third of a day behind schedule. After a break for the weekend, production resumed on June 27 for scenes in the botany lab, the briefing room and sickbay. One of Grace Lee Whitney's favorite sets to work on throughout the series was the lab, which was the sickbay redecorated, as she enjoyed working with George Takei. The animated plant in that scene was a hand puppet controlled from <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> Whitney later recalled that the operator could see right up her skirt throughout the shoot and would occasionally try to grope her using the puppet.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Frank Fiala, {{a wealthy}} {{businessman}} and drug trafficker, paid Gravano $40,000 to rent the Plaza Suite for {{a birthday party}} he was throwing himself. Two days after the party, Gravano accepted a $1,000,000 offer from Fiala to buy the establishment, which Gravano had only valued at $200,000. The deal was structured to include $100,000 cash as a down payment, $650,000 in gold bullion <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> a $250,000 payment at the real estate closing.|$|E
6000|$|Strong pressed <b>the</b> Colonel's foot <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> here; <b>and</b> Altamont, rather excited, {{filled up}} another bumper, nodded to Pen, drank off his wine, and said, [...] "He was a gentleman, {{and that was}} sufficient, {{and they were all}} gentlemen." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was at the}} Baptist church supper, a {{week after}} the picnic, that she saw him again. She had gone with Kennicott and Aunt Bessie to the supper, which was spread on oilcloth-covered <b>and</b> trestle-supported <b>tables</b> in <b>the</b> church basement. Erik was helping Myrtle Cass to fill coffee cups for the waitresses. The {{congregation}} had doffed their piety. Children tumbled <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> <b>and</b> Deacon Pierson greeted the women with a rolling, [...] "Where's Brother Jones, sister, where's Brother Jones? Not {{going to be with us}} tonight? Well, you tell Sister Perry to hand you a plate, and make 'em give you enough oyster pie!" ...|$|R
60|$|When he {{got there}} he found Pony's mother about crazy. He said now they must search the house thoroughly; and they went down into the cellar first, because she said she knew Pony had fallen {{down the stairs and}} killed himself. But he was not there, and then they hunted through all the rooms <b>and</b> looked <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> beds and into the {{cupboards}} and closets, and he was not there. Then they went into the wood-house and looked there, and up into the wood-house loft among the old stoves and broken furniture, and he was not there. Trip was there, and he made them think so of Pony that Pony's mother took on worse than she had yet.|$|R
500|$|Like {{the other}} Romanov children, Tatiana was raised with some austerity. She {{and her sisters}} slept on camp beds without pillows, took cold baths in the morning, and were {{expected}} to keep themselves occupied with embroidery or knitting projects {{if they had a}} spare moment. Their work was given as gifts or sold at charity bazaars. According to one story, Tatiana, accustomed to being addressed only by her name and patronymic, was so disconcerted when she was addressed as [...] "Your Imperial Highness" [...] by lady-in-waiting Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden when she was heading a committee meeting that she kicked the woman <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> hissed [...] "Are you crazy to speak to me like that?" ...|$|E
2500|$|As a small child, he {{occasionally}} played pranks on guests. [...] One example {{occurred at a}} formal dinner party, where Alexei removed the shoe of a female guest from <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> showed it to his father. Nicholas sternly told the boy to return the [...] "trophy", which Alexei did after placing a large ripe strawberry into the toe of the shoe.|$|E
2500|$|The key {{signature}} of the Miniature Killer’s crimes were meticulous scale models built to reflect each crime scene. [...] The models were either left at the murder site or delivered to someone involved in solving the case. Every detail was accurate, and even used the victim's real blood instead of paint. Every model also contained a hidden picture of a bloodied doll and an item somehow related to bleach. Her victims were killed in widely different manners, including bludgeoning, poisoning, and electrocution. Many of her victims had employed her services as a cleaning lady (paying <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table),</b> <b>and</b> several also had connections to her foster father.|$|E
50|$|The {{captain of}} one team takes a coin <b>and</b> passes it <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to <b>the</b> second {{person of the}} team. The players on that team pass <b>the</b> coin <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> back <b>and</b> forth from one player to another. The object {{of the game is}} to do it so {{carefully}} that the opposing team cannot guess which player has the coin.|$|R
60|$|From <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> calm <b>and</b> smiling, rose Dirkovitch, who {{had been}} roused from healthful slumber by feet upon his body. By {{the side of the}} man he rose, and the man shrieked and grovelled. It was a horrible sight coming so swiftly upon the pride and glory of the toast that had brought the strayed wits together.|$|R
50|$|Back in {{her hotel}} room, Isabel takes a box from <b>under</b> <b>the</b> bedside <b>table</b> <b>and</b> {{takes out a}} gun. She checks the loaded drum {{magazine}} and hides <b>the</b> gun <b>under</b> a pillow. Then she prepares to take a bath. She takes off her clothes and her black wig. With her long, blonde hair she looks strikingly different.|$|R
2500|$|The third clarity factor {{which is}} {{assessed}} is the characteristic's position. When an inclusion is {{directly under the}} table of the diamond it is most visible. An inclusion <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> positioned close to a pavilion facet will reflect multiple times around the stone, giving this type of inclusion the name [...] "reflector". Reflectors are graded as if each reflection were an inclusion (although in plotting the diamond it is only plotted once). For this reason, reflectors have {{a greater impact on}} the clarity grade. Inclusions become less visible when they are positioned under the crown facets, or near the girdle of the stone. These inclusions may often be more easily seen from the pavilion side of the diamond than from crown side of the diamond.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1994, Matthews' older sister, Anne, {{who lived}} in South Africa, was murdered by her husband, who {{subsequently}} committed suicide, on or around January 27 of that year. The event {{had a profound effect}} on Matthews' outlook on life and was referenced in a few of his songs. On January 29, 1994, he performed with Tim Reynolds at The Wetlands in New York, where he dedicated that performance [...] "to her [...] memory". Dave Matthews Band's <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> <b>and</b> Dreaming, released later that year, was dedicated to her. Anne Matthews was survived by her two children who, upon her death, traveled to America, where Dave and his younger sister, Jane, took responsibility for their upbringing (his sister is the namesake of DMB's song, [...] "The Song That Jane Likes").|$|E

5000|$|A Palace Concert (...) is a Chinese Tang Dynasty silk {{painting}} showing ten court {{ladies and}} two standing servant maidens {{around a large}} rectangular table. Some court ladies are depicted drinking tea, while others drink wine. The four women {{at the far end}} are presumably responsible for playing music and livening up the mood. The musical instruments depicted, from left to right, are bamboo pipes, guqin, pipa and flute. One of the servant maidens plays a clapper to maintain beat. A small dog is depicted <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> artist <b>and</b> the precise year of the painting are unknown. The painting is housed in the National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan.|$|R
50|$|This {{painting}} {{presents a}} scene where the lute player stands in the centre. A woman besides him looks at the partiture, near a <b>table.</b> <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> a cat <b>and</b> a dog are playing. These domestic components contrast with the landscape of Amsterdam which is seen through a window.|$|R
50|$|The {{three men}} soon arrive to Elvira's building, and Christopher persuades {{the two men}} to let him stay with them for the night since he has nowhere else to go. Christopher soon discovers the {{incompetence}} of the two servants and tries to teach Stan the proper etiquette at a formal dinner. He fails in his mission, and instead offers to help by hiding <b>under</b> <b>the</b> dinner <b>table</b> <b>and</b> giving commands to Stan from there during the dinner, by using his hand to tap on Stan's foot.|$|R
60|$|Anne {{raised her}} head to speak. Arnold pressed her hand warningly, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> silenced her.|$|E
60|$|She {{refused to}} answer him. No one spoke. After a while he threw his boots <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> went to bed.|$|E
60|$|Here {{the boys}} emerged from <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and,</b> with hands and faces well {{plastered}} with molasses, began a vigorous kissing of the baby.|$|E
5000|$|The Heritage Floor, {{which sits}} {{underneath}} <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> features <b>the</b> names of 999 women inscribed on white handmade porcelain floor tilings. The tilings cover {{the full extent}} of <b>the</b> triangular <b>table</b> area, from <b>the</b> footings at each place setting, continues <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> themselves <b>and</b> fills <b>the</b> full enclosed area within <b>the</b> three <b>tables.</b> There are 2304 tiles with names spread across more than one tile. The names are written in the Palmer cursive script, a twentieth century American form. Chicago states that the criteria for a woman's name being included in the floor were {{one or more of the}} following: ...|$|R
60|$|The punch being, by this time, drunk out, and {{the little}} Kenwigses (who had for some time {{previously}} held their little eyes open with their little forefingers) becoming fractious, and requesting rather urgently {{to be put to}} bed, the collector made a move by pulling out his watch, and acquainting the company that it was nigh two o'clock; whereat some of the guests were surprised and others shocked, and hats and bonnets being groped for <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> <b>and</b> in course of time found, their owners went away, after a vast deal of shaking of hands, and many remarks how they had never spent such a delightful evening, and how they marvelled to find it so late, expecting to have heard that it was half-past ten at the very latest, and how they wished that Mr and Mrs Kenwigs had a wedding-day once a week, and how they wondered by what hidden agency Mrs Kenwigs could possibly have managed so well; and a great deal more of the same kind. To all of which flattering expressions, Mr and Mrs Kenwigs replied, by thanking every lady and gentleman, SERIATIM, for the favour of their company, and hoping they might have enjoyed themselves only half as well as they said they had.|$|R
50|$|The story {{starts off}} by {{introducing}} the main character; Radium Lavans, a reckless Phantoma LEV {{pilot in the}} BAHRAM military forces. His comrade is the skilled Viola. The plot quickly introduces them having a hate for Earth as people who live on Mars are ridiculed and outcast by Earth people. These Terran feelings of superiority presumably spring from Martian colonists' weaker physical abilities and size - {{a side effect of}} the planet's lower gravity - combined with traditional colonial prejudices. It is evident there is an ongoing <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> conflict, <b>and</b> BAHRAM is involved with liberating the tight Federation grasp of Earth.|$|R
60|$|Every {{vestige of}} colour {{had left her}} cheeks. The Baroness touched her foot <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> Louise found her voice with an effort.|$|E
6000|$|She bowed, and the {{reflection}} bowed. Then she laughed again, long and merrily, and the Glass Cat crept out from <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Barker made a scuffling {{sound with}} his boots <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> {{rose to his}} feet. [...] "I guess," [...] he said, [...] "I shall have to be going." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{ensemble}} {{is dedicated}} to building connections in the theatrical community, and to that end hosts a biennial festival of experimental theater called the FURY Factory. The Factory brings together ensemble companies {{from all around the}} country and different parts of the world. Past companies include Pig Iron, Banana Bag & Bodice, Witness Relocation, <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table,</b> Hand2Mouth, MondoBizarro, <b>and</b> some 30 others.|$|R
60|$|After {{which we}} brooded for a bit. Uncle Willoughby pottered about the room, {{registering}} baffledness, while I sat sucking at a cigarette, feeling {{rather like a}} chappie I'd once read about in a book, who murdered another cove and hid <b>the</b> body <b>under</b> <b>the</b> dining-room <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> then {{had to be the}} life and soul of a dinner party, with it there all the time. My guilty secret oppressed me {{to such an extent that}} after a while I couldn't stick it any longer. I lit another cigarette and started for a stroll in the grounds, by way of cooling off.|$|R
25|$|National Hockey League (NHL) teams {{took notice}} of Conacher's ability. The Toronto St. Pats offered him $3,000 a season – {{three times the}} average salary – to play for them in 1920–21, while in 1921, the Montreal Canadiens offered $5,000 and support setting up a business. He turned both down as he was not yet willing to {{surrender}} his status as an amateur athlete. His decisions to refuse the offers led to speculation {{that he was being}} paid <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> He <b>and</b> Billy Burch were accused of deliberately throwing a game in 1922, but were absolved of guilt by the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada.|$|R
60|$|Wolfenden {{received}} a kick <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> Harcutt's face positively beamed with delight. Mr. Blatherwick, however, had almost forgotten their proximity. He {{had made up}} his mind to order champagne.|$|E
60|$|Together {{we pulled}} the unfortunate fellow from <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> as {{we looked at}} his {{dripping}} head we exchanged glances, and I do not know which was the paler of the two.|$|E
6000|$|... "Again {{we placed}} the goblet {{of water on}} the clean slate <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> while holding it as before, I said: 'Now ask them to write the name [...] "William Dean Howells."' ...|$|E
50|$|Each {{performance}} requires lengthy preparations {{beginning with}} numerous sketches and experiments on <b>the</b> sand <b>table</b> itself. <b>The</b> creation generally undergoes extensive changes {{until the final}} version is crystallized. During the performances, Yahav uses her hands to create images in sand on a transparent back-lit table, while a video camera positioned above her displays the emerging creation on a screen in real-time. Music and light form important elements of Yahav's creations. Lights emerge from <b>under</b> <b>the</b> transparent <b>table</b> <b>and</b> a soundtrack plays which has been selected by her to convey specific messages and sensations. Original music is sometimes composed and produced especially for this purpose.|$|R
60|$|They met an {{hour later}} at luncheon, all but the Duchessa, who sulked in her garden. Tato was bright and smiling, filled with a {{suppressed}} joy which bubbled up {{in spite of the}} little one's effort to be dignified and sedate. When her hand stole <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to find <b>and</b> press that of her father, Uncle John beamed upon her approvingly; for he knew what had occurred and could sympathize with her delight.|$|R
6000|$|The {{sympathetic}} negro became again anxious, {{and looked}} hastily <b>under</b> <b>the</b> chairs <b>and</b> <b>tables</b> for <b>the</b> lost one, {{while her mother}} opened and searched a corner cupboard {{that could not have}} held a child half her size. Then the pair became more and more distracted as each excited the other, and ran to the various outhouses shouting, [...] "Zariffa!" [...] anxiously, entreatingly, despairing.|$|R
