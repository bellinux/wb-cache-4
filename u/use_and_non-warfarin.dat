40|$|Class of 2015 AbstractObjectives: Warfarin has {{historically}} been the anticoagulant used for the primary prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF), however three target specific oral anticoagulants, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, have recently been approved for use in this setting. Current literature lacks a comparison of these four drugs in relation to post-stroke outcomes, and this study aims to compare their performance in a natural setting. Methods: This retrospective cohort study identified stroke patients admitted to an academic medical center between January 2013 <b>and</b> December 2014 <b>using</b> the Quintiles, Inc. -American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Stroke database; pertinent data was collected from the database and patient electronic medical records. Primary endpoints measured were length of stay, 30 -day readmission, and discharge disposition; secondary endpoints included rates of admission to {{the intensive care unit}} (ICU) and complications. Results: Of 940 stroke admissions, 53 ischemic stroke patients were identified as receiving an oral anticoagulant for stroke prevention in AF. The warfarin (n= 40) <b>and</b> <b>non-warfarin</b> (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, <b>and</b> apixaban; n= 13) groups were well matched regarding admission demographics, however patients taking warfarin {{were more likely to have}} an elevated INR at hospital admission (P= 0. 0053) and receive tPA (P= 0. 047). Patients in the warfarin group were also statistically significantly more likely to receive warfarin on discharge (P= 0. 004). No endpoints achieved statistical significance. Conclusions: No differences in post-stroke outcomes between warfarin <b>and</b> <b>non-warfarin</b> oral anticoagulants <b>used</b> for stroke prevention in AF were found...|$|R
40|$|Background. Nearly 30000 {{people suffer}} a stroke in Sweden every year. Stroke {{is the third}} {{most common cause of}} death after heart disease and cancer {{carrying}} a 17 % mortality rate at three months. It is {{the most common cause of}} neurological disability in adults. Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase is the only approved pharmacological therapy for acute ischemic stroke, improving neurological and functional outcome in one third of all treated patients. Meanwhile, thrombolytic treatment can in itself cause intracerebral hemorrhage. The aim of this thesis was to study risk factors associated with this complication, in a large cohort of ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous alteplase. Methods. All studies were based on patient data contained within the Safe Implementation of Treatments of Stroke - International Stroke Thrombolysis Register (SITS-ISTR). The main outcomes of interest were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) by SITS-MOST, ECASS II and NINDS definitions, functional status at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale), and death at 7 days and 3 months. Study 1. We aimed to develop a clinical scoring algorithm predicting the risk of SICH, using data from 31627 patients. Baseline and demographic factors associated with SICH were entered into a logistic regression model. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were converted into points, summated to produce a risk score. We identified 9 predictors of SICH: stroke severity, plasma glucose, blood pressure, age, body weight, stroke onset to treatment time, aspirin or combined aspirin and clopidogrel, and history of hypertension. The overall rate of SICH was 1, 8 %. The score ranged from 0 to 12 points, showing a > 70 -fold increase in the rate of SICH for patients with a score ≥ 10 points (14, 3 %) compared to 0 points (0, 2 %), with an acceptable predictive performance, AUC-ROC = 0, 70. We concluded that the SITS SICH Score is able to predict large thrombolysis-related SICH associated with severe clinical deterioration. Study 2. The SEDAN score is another prediction algorithm for SICH. We assessed its predictive performance for two definitions of SICH. Odds ratios for SICH per one-point increase of the score were obtained using logistic regression. The predictive capability for SICH per ECASS II was moderate at AUC-ROC = 0, 66. With rising scores, there was a moderate increase in risk for SICH ECASS II (OR 1, 7 per point, p< 0, 001), SICH rates between 1, 6 % for 0 points and 16, 9 % for ≥ 5 points. Prediction of SICH per SITS-MOST was weaker, AUC-ROC = 0, 60, rates between 0, 8 % for 0 points and 5, 4 % for ≥ 5 points. We concluded that the predictive performance of the SEDAN was moderate for SICH per ECASS II and low for SICH per SITS-MOST. Study 3. The European license for alteplase contraindicates its use in stroke patients treated with warfarin. Conversely, American guidelines accept it in patients with an international normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1, 7. We studied the influence of warfarin on SICH, arterial recanalization, functional outcome and mortality in 768 patients with baseline warfarin treatment and INR≤ 1, 7. They were older, had more comorbidities, and more severe strokes compared to patients without warfarin. There were no differences in SICH rates, mortality or functional outcome between warfarin <b>and</b> <b>non-warfarin</b> patients after adjustment for differences in age, stroke severity and co-morbidities. Arterial recanalization defined as the disappearance of a baseline hyperdense cerebral artery sign at 22 - 36 hour imaging was increased in warfarin patients at 63 % vs 55 %, p= 0, 022. Study 4. Hemorrhage following stroke thrombolysis can occur in brain parenchyma remote from acutely ischemic tissue (PHr), as well as in local relation to the infarct (PH). We investigated the risk factors, mortality and functional outcome in patients with the poorly understood complication of PHr, as well as PH, and concomitant occurrence of both. We compared baseline data in 970 patients (2, 2 %) with PHr, 2325 patients (5, 3 %) with local PH, and 39761 patients (91, 4 %) without PH or PHr. Independent risk factors were obtained by multivariate logistic regression. Increasing age and blood pressure were the only strong risk factors for PHr. High stroke severity, atrial fibrillation, CT hyperdense cerebral artery sign, i e factors indicating large artery occlusion, were associated with local PH. Functional independence at 3 months was more common in PHr than PH (34 % vs 24 %, p< 0, 001), 3 month mortality was lower (34 % vs 39 %, p< 0, 001). PH and PHr were equally often symptomatic. The better outcome in PHr is explained by PHr occurring in patients with milder strokes. We concluded that the differences in risk factors likely indicate an influence of underlying small vessel disease in PHr, and large vessel occlusion in PH...|$|R

Design Genetic and environmental factors were estimated on adolescent reports of their friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> their own <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> of alcohol. The correlations between the genetic and environmental factors that influence friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescent own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> were also estimated. Participants A total of 862 twin pairs aged 11 – 17 years sampled from the UK population-based Cardiff Study of All Wales and North-west of England Twins (CaStANET). Measurements Data on adolescent own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> <b>and</b> the alcohol <b>use</b> of their three best friends were obtained using self-report questionnaires. Findings A significant genetic influence was found on adolescent friends' alcohol use (about 30 %). Significant correlations of 0. 60 and 0. 70 were found between the genetic influences on friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescents' own <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> of alcohol. Common environmental influences were almost completely correlated for friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescents' own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> (0. 91 <b>and</b> 0. 94).

40|$|Background Cannabis <b>use</b> <b>and</b> {{depressive}} mood symptoms in adolescence {{have been found}} to co-occur. In exploring the nature of this relationship and in the search for mechanisms that explain this link, scholars have postulated the idea for a ‘common liability model’. According to this model, the link between cannabis <b>use</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms can be explained by an underlying risk factor. One important candidate for this underlying risk factor may be self-control, as a reflection of immature self-regulatory systems in adolescence. In the present study, we will test the extent to which joint development of cannabis <b>use</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms can be explained as an expression of self-control. Methods A total of 428 adolescents participated in a five-wave longitudinal design. Main study outcomes were self-reports of self-control (age 12) <b>and</b> cannabis <b>use</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms (ages 12 – 16). Results We established six trajectories of joint development of cannabis <b>use</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms. Conditional probabilities indicated that cannabis <b>use</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms were symmetrically related. Levels of self-control were lowest for adolescents following the joint developmental pathway of cannabis <b>use</b> <b>and</b> high depressive symptoms. Conclusions Low levels of self-control are predictive of joint development of cannabis <b>use</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms. Future studies should concentrate on the role of self-control in co-occurrence of other health risk behaviors and on psychological and physiological mechanisms underlying self-control and its relation to co-occurrence...|$|R

Results: Women and girls comprise one-third of people who <b>use</b> <b>and</b> inject drugs globally. There is substantial variation in HIV prevalence in this population, between and within countries. There is a pronounced lack of data examining HIV risk among particularly vulnerable subpopulations of women who <b>use</b> <b>and</b> inject drugs, including women {{who have sex with}} women, transgender women, racial and ethnic minority women, and young women. Women who <b>use</b> <b>and</b> inject drugs experience stigma and discrimination that affect access to services, and high levels of sexual risk exposures.
