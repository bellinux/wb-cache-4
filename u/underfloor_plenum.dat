This final report presents detailed results in four major task areas as summarized below. Recommended commissioning guidelines were developed for the following three key elements affecting UFAD system performance: (1) procedures for measuring, adjusting, and optimizing room air stratification; (2) a new test protocol for determining air leakage from underfloor plenums; and (3) strategies and methods for controlling and managing thermal decay (temperature gain) in <b>underfloor</b> <b>plenums.</b> Emphasis is placed on commissioning procedures that are practical and {{as simple as possible}} for use by commissioning agents, and promote energy efficient operation while maintaining thermal comfort. The guidelines were developed through a combination of field and laboratory experiments, fundamental energy simulations, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, and simplified design tool studies. A number of improvements were made to EnergyPlus/UFAD, a version of the publicly available whole-building energy simulation program, EnergyPlus (developed under a previous PIER contract), which greatly enhanced its capabilities for modeling the more complex heat transfer processes found in UFAD systems. The improved version of EnergyPlus was in turn used as a basis for developing a more comprehensive simplified design tool for determining design cooling loads for UFAD systems, the first of its kind. Radiant slab cooling systems were found to demonstrate strong energy saving performance and improved occupant satisfaction in dry western U. S. climates based on a combination of occupant satisfaction surveys, two case studies, and whole-building energy simulations.

40|$|Recent {{trends in}} today's office {{environment}} make it increasingly {{more difficult for}} conventional centralized HVAC systems to satisfy the environmental preferences of individual officer workers using the standardized approach of providing a single uniform thermal and ventilation environment. Since its original introduction in West Germany during the 1950 s, the open plan office containing modular workstation furniture and partitions is now the norm. Thermostatically controlled zones in open plan offices typically encompass relatively large numbers of workstations in which a diverse work population having {{a wide range of}} preferred temperatures must be accommodated. Modern office buildings are also being impacted by a large influx of heat-generating equipment (computers, printers, etc.) whose loads may vary considerably from workstation to workstation. Offices are often reconfigured during the building's lifetime to respond to changing tenant needs, affecting the distribution of within-space loads and the ventilation pathways among and over office partitions. Compounding this problem, there has been a growing awareness {{of the importance of the}} comfort, health, and productivity of individual office workers, giving rise to an increased demand among employers and employees for a high-quality work environment. During recent years an increasing amount of attention has been paid to air distribution systems that individually condition the immediate environments of office workers within their workstations to address the issues outlined above. As with task/ambient lighting systems, the controls for the ''task'' components of these systems are partially or entirely decentralized and under the control of the occupants. Typically, the occupant has control over the speed and direction, and in some cases the temperature, of the incoming air supply. Variously called ''task/ambient conditioning,'' ''localized thermal distribution,'' and ''personalized air conditioning'' systems, these systems have been most commonly installed in open-plan office buildings in which they provide supply air and (in some cases) radiant heating directly into workstations. TAC systems can be classified into the following two major categories: (1) furniture-based, and (2) floor-based, underfloor air distribution (UFAD). A large majority of these systems include a raised floor system with which <b>underfloor</b> <b>plenums</b> are used to deliver conditioned air to the space through floor grills, or in conjunction with the workstation furniture and partitions...|$|R

40|$|Cool {{supply air}} {{flowing through the}} <b>underfloor</b> <b>plenum</b> is exposed to heat gain from both the {{concrete}} slab (conducted from the warm return air on the adjacent floor below the slab) and the raised floor panels (conducted from the warmer room above). The magnitude of this heat gain can be quite high, resulting in undesirable loss of control of the supply air temperature from the plenum into the occupied space. These warmer supply air temperatures can {{make it more difficult}} to maintain comfort in the occupied space (without increasing airflow rates), particularly in perimeter zones where cooling loads reach their highest levels. How to predict plenum thermal performance is one of the key design issues facing practicing engineers – evidence from completed projects indicates that excessive temperature rise in the plenum can be a problem. One of the recommended strategies for addressing temperature rise in UFAD systems is the use of ductwork (flexible or rigid) within the <b>underfloor</b> <b>plenum</b> to deliver cool air preferentially to perimeter zones or other critical areas of high cooling demand. Several experiments were carried out in a full-scale <b>underfloor</b> <b>plenum</b> test facility, in order to characterize all the phenomena that take place in an <b>underfloor</b> <b>plenum</b> equipped with a fabric or metal duct.

50|$|Underfloor air {{distribution}} (UFAD) is an {{air distribution}} strategy for providing ventilation and space conditioning in buildings {{as part of}} the design of an HVAC system. UFAD systems use an <b>underfloor</b> supply <b>plenum</b> located between the structural concrete slab and a raised floor system to supply conditioned air through floor diffusers directly into the occupied zone of the building. Thermal stratification is one of the featured characteristic of UFAD system, which allows higher thermostat setpoints compared to the traditional overhead systems (OH). UFAD cooling load profile is different from a traditional OH system due to the impact of raised floor, particularly UFAD may has higher peak cooling load than OH systems. UFAD has several potential advantages over traditional overhead systems, including layout flexibility, improved thermal comfort, improved ventilation efficiency, improved energy efficiency in suitable climates and reduced life cycle costs. UFAD is often used in office buildings, particularly highly-reconfigurable and open plan offices where raised floors are desirable for cable management. UFAD is appropriate for a number of different building types including commercials, schools, churches, airports, museums, libraries etc. Notable buildings using UFAD system in North America include The New York Times Building, Bank of America Tower and San Francisco Federal Building. Careful considerations need to be paid in the construction phase of UFAD systems to ensure a well-sealed plenum to avoid air leakage in UFAD supply plenum.|$|R

40|$|The {{energy and}} comfort {{performance}} of buildings using underfloor air distribution (UFAD) {{has been of}} interest, with some contention, in the building industry for many years. It is not often that an opportunity to address that question directly appears. This project represented such an opportunity to compare and contrast two similarly designed buildings in the same climate and co-located near one another, both occupied by California state employees, one with a UFAD system (B 225) {{and the other with}} an overhead (OH) variable air volume (VAV) system (B 172). At the outset there was hope that we could settle the question definitively due to the highly instrumented systems in these buildings that afforded an opportunity to use measured data for the comparison. This report contains {{a detailed description of the}} measured data and simulated analyses used to compare the energy performance of UFAD vs. OH systems, and a summary of the post occupancy evaluations (POE) used to study and compare the occupant satisfaction and indoor environmental quality (IEQ) of both buildings. In addition, we report on field measurements conducted in B 225 to investigate two key performance issues with UFAD systems: (1) room air stratification and (2) temperature gain in <b>underfloor</b> <b>plenums.</b> The key findings from the study are listed here: • The measured energy performance data indicates improved efficiency for the UFAD system (B 225) vs. the OH system (B 172), as annual cooling energy is 31 % higher and total annual fan energy is 50 % higher for B 172 compared to B 225. • To account for all major design and operating differences between the buildings, we developed an alternative analysis method based on estimating the impact on B 172 energy performance as if it was configured and equipped with central system equipment similar to B 225; aka “apples to apples” comparison. When this “apples to apples” comparison method was applied, the total annual HVAC energy use (including cooling, heating, and fans) for OH (B 172) is 20 % higher than UFAD (B 225) and total annual whole building energy use for B 172 is 8 % higher than B 225. • Based on the calculated Energy Star ratings, both B 225 and B 172 demonstrate excellent energy performance overall. B 225 showed a very high site Energy Star rating of 98 and the Energy Star rating for the B 171 - 174 complex (B 172 could not be calculated separately) was 91, both well above the 75 required to receive the Energy Star label. • The final POE surveys conducted during October 2007 in the two buildings found that the satisfaction ratings were generally positive and very nearly the same for most of the categories. An important lesson learned from the repeated surveys in B 225 between 2003 and 2007 was the value of continuous commissioning of a building’s HVAC system. Efforts by building operations staff and the research team led to an improved understanding of the unique features of the UFAD system, and as a result, greater occupant satisfaction with the quality of the indoor environment in B 225...|$|R
50|$|Plenum {{supply air}} {{temperature}} rise is the increase of the conditioned air due to convective heat gain as it travels through the <b>underfloor</b> supply <b>plenum</b> from the plenum inlet to the floor diffusers. This phenomenon is also named thermal decay. Plenum air temperature rise is caused by cool supply air coming into contact with warmer than air concrete slab and raised floor. According to a modeling study, air temperature rise can be quite significant (as much as 5 °C or 9 °F) and subsequently, compared to an idealized simulated UFAD case with no air temperature rise, elevated diffuser air temperatures can lead to higher supply airflow rate and increased fan and chiller energy consumption. The same study found that air temperature rise in summer is higher than in winter and it also depends on the climate. The ground floor with a slab on grade has less temperature rise compared to middle and top floors, and an increase of the {{supply air temperature}} causes {{a decrease in the}} temperature rise. The temperature rise is not significantly affected by the perimeter zone orientation, the internal heat gain and the window-to-wall ratio. Supply plenum air temperature rise, thus, has implications on the energy saving potential of UFAD systems and their ability to meet cooling requirements with supply temperatures above those of conventional overhead systems. Current research suggests that both energy and thermal performance can be improved in UFAD systems by ducting air to perimeter zones where loads tend to be the greatest. Critics suggest however that such underfloor ducting reduces the benefit of having a low-pressure plenum space, as well as adding design and installation complications when fitting ducts between floor tile pedestals.|$|R

The simplified design tool is able to account for key differences between UFAD and traditional mixing overhead (OH) systems.

Based on 87 EnergyPlus simulations, four regression models have been developed to transform the OH cooling load into the UFAD cooling load, and then to split this total load between the supply plenum, zone (room), and return plenum. The regression models mainly depend on floor level, and position (interior or perimeter) and orientation of the zone under analysis. Although considered in the analysis, supply air temperature, window-to-wall ratio, internal heat load, plenum configuration, climate, presence of the carpet and structure type do not strongly influence the developed models. The results show that, generally, UFAD has a peak cooling load 19 % higher than an overhead cooling load and 22 % and 37 % of the total zone UFAD cooling load goes to the supply plenum in the perimeter and interior, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The VAV {{terminal}} unit with variable-speed (VS) fan and reheat coil is an air system {{terminal unit}} {{consisting of a}} variable speed fan in series with a heating coil. These units are usually employed in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems where the air is supplied at low static pressure through an <b>underfloor</b> <b>plenum.</b> The fan is used to control the flow of conditioned air that enters the space. When the fan is off the plenum pressure drives the minimum air flow through the terminal unit. At maximum cooling the fan runs at its maximum speed. At full heating the fan runs at its heating maximum – usually less than the cooling maximum flow rate. Thus this unit has two separate maximum flow rates – one for heating and one for cooling. For cooling, control is maintained simply by varying the fan speed. For heating, the unit first tries to meet the heating load by varying the heating coil output while keeping the air flow at minimum (fan off). If this is not adequate the fan turns on and operates in variable flow mode up to the heating maximum flow rate. This unit is modeled in EnergyPlus as a compound component – a variable speed fan and a heating coil in series in the air stream.

In order to achieve successful operation of UFAD, the active participation of all involved parties, e. g. architects, interior designers, HVAC designers, contractors etc. is needed since {{the very beginning of the}} project. Commissioning of UFAD just requires a discipline, structured approach and commitment from all participants involved. The practical study involved assessment of expected UFAD performance at the Sparebank kvartalet office building complex in Trondheim, Norway. The <b>underfloor</b> <b>plenum</b> was not properly sealed, creating a significant risk of future energy waste. The openings in the raised access floor construction also lead to the dust and dirt accumulation in the plenum. This in its turn would not only impair indoor air quality, but could also lead to the malfunction of mechanical equipment installed in the plenum. Trying to seal the plenum after laying down the carpet was found to be difficult, costly and time consuming. Even though relatively good air distribution in the entire floor was achieved, some diffusers (automatically controlled) are located too close to the workstations and it will be probably needed to rearrange their layout in order to avoid draught complaints by occupants. The easier commissioning and better performance of UFAD in Sparebank Kvartalet could actually be achieved in a less time consuming and costly way if the commissioning would start early in the pre-design phase, with a well established commissioning plan. </p...|$|E
40|$|As {{alternative}} {{systems for}} saving cooling energy compared to conventional overhead (OH) air-conditioning systems, mechanical displacement ventilation (DV) systems and underfloor air distribution (UFAD) {{systems have been}} widely adopted for commercial buildings. In these alternative systems, supply air is discharged from low momentum diffusers located at lower positions close {{to the floor in}} the DV system, and the supply air of the UFAD system is distributed by an <b>underfloor</b> <b>plenum</b> and discharged from floor diffusers. To predict transient vertical temperature responses when the heat source or the ventilation flow rate vary in time, we introduce transient two-layer stratification models of the DV and UFAD systems, non-dimensionalize them by competing the filling box time (Baines & Turner 1969) and the replenishment time in which all the air in the enclosure is replaced by supply air and validate them by laboratory experiments using a salt-water analogy. In various scenarios of the heat source and the ventilation flow rate, the models show a good agreement with the laboratory experiments. Building energy simulation, which predicts cooling and heating demands of a building, has been used for building design, environment, economics, and occupant comfort. EnergyPlus, which is a building energy simulation tools developed by the U. S. Department of Energy, has integrated capability to predict cooling and heating demands as well as the HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) energy consumption. To evaluate performance of energy savings of UFAD, we developed prototype office buildings adopting OH and UFAD, and the UCSD-UFAD model was used to estimate realistic cooling and heating demands by simulating the stratified temperature profile in a room.
