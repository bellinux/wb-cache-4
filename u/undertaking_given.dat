2500|$|Manufacture of the [...] "NC"s {{began in}} 1918 during World War I. The U.S. Navy wished for an {{aircraft}} capable of long ocean flights, both for Anti-submarine warfare patrol, and if possible with capability to fly across the Atlantic Ocean {{under their own}} power {{to avoid having to}} be shipped through ocean waters menaced by German submarines. This was a very ambitious <b>undertaking,</b> <b>given</b> the state of aviation at the time. The Navy and Curtiss came up with one of the largest biplane designs yet produced, equipped with sleeping quarters and a wireless transmitter/receiver. It was originally powered by three V12 Liberty engines, of 400hp (298kW) each; during the testing phase Marc Mitscher recommended the addition of a fourth engine to help create enough power to lift the boats out of the water. [...] The fourth engine was added to the midline in a pusher configuration. The maximum speed was 90mph (144km/h) and the estimated maximum range was 1,500mi (2,400km). [...] Called NC boats, with the [...] "N" [...] for Navy and [...] "C" [...] for the builder Curtiss, they were nicknamed [...] "Nancys".|$|E

While modern expectations and needs mean that all the farmers own land outside the open fields, the open fields are not part of a museum or showcase but a living part of the agricultural landscape. The system is protected today by a Parliamentary <b>undertaking</b> <b>given</b> by the Crown Estate Commissioners on their 1981 purchase of the Laxton estate and by a Countryside Stewardship agreement held between the Court Leet and the then-Countryside Commission.

5000|$|Having outlived {{all their}} fellow chiefs, both Patuone and Nene were {{subjected}} to considerable resentment from Kawiti's son, Maihi Paraone Kawiti who had personal pretensions and supporters seeking to have him made arikinui or paramount chief of Ngāpuhi.

Ngāpuhi was always a coalition of closely related chiefs, {{all of whom had}} [...] "standing" [...] in their own right and therefore any notion of a paramount chief was fraught with challenges. It was certainly not a debate into which Patuone and Nene entered: they had no reason to do so as their senior status and great personal mana was clear to all. Nene certainly offered to build a flour mill at his own expense for Kawiti and Heke's people as part of a peace offering but equally, sought the re-erection of the flagstaff at Maiki Hill, an <b>undertaking</b> <b>given</b> by the senior Kawiti prior to his death.
