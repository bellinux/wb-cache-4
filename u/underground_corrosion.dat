The soil samples are collected from the depth from which the infrastructure will be installed because soil properties can change from strata to strata. The minimum test of in-situ soil resistivity is measured using the wenner 4 pin method if often performed to judge a site's corrosivity, but if the test is performed during a dry period, the soil's actual corrosivity may not be properly reported since underground condensation can occur on buried metals leaving the soil touching the metal surfaces in a more moist status. This is why measuring a soil's minimum or saturated resistivity is so important. Soil resistivity testing alone will also not identify corrosive elements. Corrosion engineers can investigate locations experiencing active corrosion using above ground survey methods and design corrosion control systems such as cathodic protection to stop or reduce the rate of corrosion.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{interest}} in long-term <b>underground</b> <b>corrosion</b> has greatly increased {{because of the}} ongoing need to dispose of nuclear waste. Additionally, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 requires disposal of high-level nuclear waste in an underground repository.

Consequently, the resulting models oversimplify the complex mechanisms of underground metal corrosion. The complexity of stainless steel corrosion mechanisms and the processes by which corrosion products migrate from their source are not well depicted by a corrosion rate based on general attack.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Since about 1980 Corrosion Monitoring Systems {{have been}} used in many {{concrete}} structures in aggressive environment worldwide. While these systemswork properly in aboveground environment, some ques-tions have arisen for submerged conditions, e. g. the outer sides of tunnels, piers in seawater or foundations in wet soil. One question concerns macro-cell formation between reinforcement in submerged concrete and in nearby aerated concrete, which might lead to severe corrosion for certain types or configurations of structures (“hollow leg”). In addition, in some cases, unexpected monitoring signals have been measured in submerged structures. The interpretation of electrochemical methods for monitoring the corrosion activity is not straightforward and new criteria have to be developed. This paper reports on an example of corrosion monitoring of an underground structure, the Green Heart Tunnel in The Netherlands. New criteria for interpretation of <b>underground</b> <b>corrosion</b> monitoring are proposed. ...|$|E

MIC has been identified as one of the major causes of <b>underground</b> pipeline <b>corrosion</b> failure and Sulphate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) are the main reason causing MIC, by accelerating corrosion rate. The objectives {{of this paper is to}} study the SRB growth namely, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 7757 correlating to one of the important environment parameter which is temperature. Thus, a determination of the optimum value for the parameter influencing the corrosion process on the internal pipe of carbon steel grade API X 70 is unveiled.

Cathodic protection (CP) method {{is the most important}} in order to prevent <b>underground</b> <b>corrosion.</b> In this project, Cathodic Protection by using sacrificial anodes technique will be used to the underground steel pipeline. In this project a study of the performance of magnesium and zinc anodes have been carried out. Besides that, in order to know the effect of coating to the corrosion rate, the specimens of steel pipe have been coats using paint. All of the specimens were buried in the soil with depth 0. 2 m, pH 5. 49. Each sample undergoes underground exposure for 28 days before the surface morphology investigation was conducted using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). After the exposure period, cleaning process for all specimens follows prior to the final analysis. Corrosion rates were calculated using weight loss methods for all of the specimens. Magnesium sacrificial anode gives better protection to the steel pipe compare to the zinc anode. The result of the corrosion rate for cathodically protected coated steel pipe by using magnesium anode was lowest which is 0. 80 mpy compared to the cathodically protected coated steel pipe with sacrificial zinc anode, the corrosion rate is 2. 32 mpy. The result for coated steel pipe without using any anode is 2. 71 mpy. The magnesium anode performance yield similar result to the cathodicaly protected for uncoated steel pipe. The corrosion rate for coated steel pipe is around 0. 80 mpy to 2. 71 mpy which is lowest compare to corrosion rate for uncoated steel pipe is around 9. 86 mpy to 15. 68 mpy. Surface morphology examinations indicate the type of corrosion occurred on the steel pipe was uniform corrosion and galvanic corrosion. In conclusion, the conjoint use of cathodic protection and coating takes advantage of the most attractive features of each method of corrosion control. Magnesium anodes proves to be more practical anode in applying Cathodic Protection for underground steel pipelines...|$|E

40|$|The {{capacity}} of ground support components {{which have been}} affected by corrosion is reduced and may ultimately lead to failure of the component and the strata. In order to maintain an effective, long-term ground support system, significant campaigns of rehabilitation are often required in corrosion affected areas. The most common corrosion protection for steel ground support utilises sacrificial systems such as galvanising. Galvanising has previously been proven to be susceptible to some corrosion processes. Stainless steel is the most effective in resistance to corrosion, but can be cost prohibitive, and its mechanical properties often make it unsuited for use in ground support components. Providing an outer protective plastic coating to bolts has proven to be an effective means of protecting the inner steel bar from corrosion. However, these support systems tend to be heavy, and require post point anchor cement grouting to provide full encapsulation. In comparison to a standard bolt/resin system, they are slow to install and expensive. These systems have also been shown to reduce overall load transfer performance of the bolting system. In order to provide a higher level of corrosion protection whilst maintaining current installation practises and bolting cycle times, Minova has developed the Enduro™ steel ground support range. The Enduro™ range consists of standard Minova steel ground support components which have been treated with a unique coating process. The Enduro™ coating has been tested in the harshest of conditions, both underground and in controlled laboratory conditions. It has been proven to effectively resist or eliminate the formation of corrosion, even in the most aggressive environments. This paper outlines the laboratory and <b>underground</b> <b>corrosion</b> performance testing carried out on Enduro™ ground support products...|$|E

40|$|A 1970 study {{initiated}} by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), {{now known as the}} National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), buried over 6000 corrosion coupons or specimens of stainless steel Types 201, 202, 301, 304, 316, 409, 410, 430, and 434. The coupons were configured as sheet metal plates, coated plates, cross-welded plates, U-bend samples, sandwiched materials, and welded tubes. All coupons were of various heat-treatments and cold worked conditions and were buried at six distinctive soil-type sites throughout the United States. The NBS scientists dug five sets of two trenches at each of the six sites. In each pair of trenches, they buried duplicate sets of stainless steel coupons. The NBS study was designed to retrieve coupons after one year, two years, four years, eight years, and x years in the soil. During the first eight years of the study, four of five planned removals were completed. After the fourth retrieval, the NBS study was abandoned, and the fifth and final set of specimens remained undisturbed for over 33 years. In 2003, an interdisciplinary research team of industrial, university, and national laboratory investigators were funded under the United States Department of Energy’s Environmental Management Science Program (EMSP; Project Number 86803) to extract part of the remaining set of coupons at one of the test sites, characterize the stainless steel <b>underground</b> <b>corrosion</b> rates, and examine the fate and transport of metal ions into the soil. Extraction of one trench at one of the test sites occurred in April 2004. This report details only the characterization of corrosion found on the 14 welded coupons–two cross welded plates, six U-bends, and six welded tubes–that were retrieved from Site D, located near Wildwood, NJ.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of a buried steel pipeline is {{strongly influenced by}} external corrosion due to soil. However, the external corrosion {{does not affect the}} pipeline equally at all locations and corrosion does not grow at the same rate throughout a pipeline. Therefore, the need of reliable predictive corrosion model is of great interest among researchers and engineers. The available current models are relying on huge historical data storage; thus, massive excavation works, equipment and technical expertise are required. In addition, the feasibility of these models for practical application in different regions with different climate and soil conditions still remains unknown. Therefore, this research aims to develop a predictive model for <b>underground</b> <b>corrosion</b> with the improved multi-parameter models in which several soil characteristics are considered without the need for a return trip to the field, onsite excavation and the presence of technical expertise. Moreover, the models developed in this study are based on empirical results reflecting a wide range of exposure conditions suitable for Malaysia’s site conditions through Component 1 and 2. Two predictive corrosion models based on power law equation were developed using two different approaches at two different locations namely real and simplified sites. The most common applied model used to predict corrosion loss is the power law model (P = ktv), where t is exposure time, and k and v are constant regression of soil parameters. There are a total of 932 mild steel coupons being buried in soil up to 18 -month period in 5 different locations and 65 soils samples were analysed for its contents and engineering properties. The results were analysed using statistical methods such as exploratory data (EDA), single linear regression (SLR), principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression (MLR), while Component 3 was conducted to verify the models using two-way ANOVA (Analysis of variance). From the analysis, the extraction of soil variables related to k and v were successfully obtained. In order to get the best fit of predictive model, the extracted variables are modelled using MLR with 20 combinations of linear equation and embedded in the power law equation. The model revealed that chloride (CL), resistivity (RE), organic (ORG), moisture content (WC) and pH were found to be the most influential variable in predicted mass loss, k while sulphate content (SO), plasticity index (PI) and clay content (CC) appear to be influential with v. The predictive corrosion models based on data from real and simplified sites have yielded reasonable prediction of metal mass loss with R 2 score of 0. 89 and 0. 81 respectively. This research has introduced innovative ways to model the corrosion growth for underground pipeline environment. Moreover, heavy statistical analysis has been utilised to determine the level of influence of soil contents and its engineering properties towards soil corrosivity. The model enables to predict potential metal mass loss, hence the level of soil corrosivity for Malaysia.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. This {{research}} {{investigates the}} effect of tropical Hawaii soils on the corrosion behavior of 1040, medium carbon steel. The primary objectives of this research were to 1. measure the rate of corrosion in sterile and unsterile soils from Andisol, Oxisol, and Molisol type tropical soils, and ascertain whether corrosion rates in unsterile soils, under aerobic and/or anaerobic soil conditions, will be greater than those in sterile soils, under aerobic and/or anaerobic conditions, 2. examine the influence of aerobic and anaerobic soil conditions from Andisol, Oxisol, and Molisol type tropical soils on the primary type of corrosion product formed on 1040, medium carbon steel; 3. determine {{if there was an}} effect from the presence of microbial activity as a mean for <b>underground</b> <b>corrosion</b> on 1040, medium carbon steel; and 4. interpret the working electrode (WE) and oxidation-reduction (redox) potentials from Andisol, Oxisol, and Molisol type tropical soils at the experimental field sites by correlating the results with soil moisture conditions and against the controlled conditions in the laboratory. The research was conducted on 1040, medium carbon steel in an Andisol using laboratory bench-scale systems, and between all three soil types using field-scale systems set up in an Andisol on the Island of Hawaii, and an Oxisol, and a Molisol on the Island of Oahu. Andisol soils in the laboratory were compared against sterilized soils of the same type and held under either aerobic or anaerobic environmental conditions. Based on the laboratory results, the highest corrosion rate for 1040, medium carbon steel was produced in an Andisol held under aerated conditions, {{regardless of whether or not}} the soil was sterilized. Therefore, the presence of oxygen played a larger role in increasing the corrosion rate than effects from the presence of microbial activity. However, measured oxygen reduction (redox) potentials indicated anaerobic pockets developed extensively in the aerated soils and correspondingly led to the development of microsites on the surface of the steel. This inconsistency made the measured soil environment results appear anoxic in systems that were aerated. The influence of aerobic or anaerobic soil conditions had an unascertainable effect on the type of corrosion product formed on the steel, as nitrogen sparged (anaerobic) environments only yielded a trace presence of elemental sulfur, as analyzed by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), in the surficial corrosion product versus the pure iron (Fe) -oxide product formed on the steel in the aerobic environments. It was assumed that unsterilized soils in anaerobic (nitrogen-sparged) conditions would produce the highest rate of corrosion on steel. However, from this experiment, in the Island of Hawaii Andisols, both unsterile and sterile conditions resulted in similar degrees of corrosion. This may indicate that microbial activity in the unsterile soil may have been suppressed by the low nutrient levels. In the laboratory chambers, the water saturated soils became anaerobic despite constant aeration which was likely caused by the nature of the saturated Andisols which prevented air from flowing through the soils. Hence the redox potentials in the aerated laboratory chambers showed that the wet soils were anaerobic. In contrast, the redox potentials in the field experiments showed that significantly more oxygen was present in these soils during rain events, or when wet. Redox in the field experiments was relatively constant even during rain periods, likely due to the soils being relatively well-drained. This indicates that oxygen content in the soil, at a depth of approximately 1 foot, was relatively constant, even as the moisture content fluctuated with the rain events. In other words, the decrease in working electrode potentials as moisture increased (during periods of rain) indicated the anodic dissolution kinetics of Fe increased with soil moisture in the field. Further, the corrosion rates at the experimental field sites were presumed to be affected by moisture content in the soil and its effect on the anodic dissolution of Fe. In other words, higher rainfall in an area should have increased the rate of corrosion and the amount of visible corrosion product on the surface of the sample coupons. However, from the experiment we learned drier soil conditions in the field raised the corrosion potential, but produced less corrosion product on the surface of the coupons. Wet soil conditions, on the other hand, lowered the corrosion potential, but raised the anodic current and produced more corrosion product. Despite a constant infusion of air into the aerated laboratory chambers, the redox potential continually produced negative readings, indicating extreme anoxic conditions. This output was likely the result of the saturated Andisol becoming sticky and plastic-like which prevented diffusion of the air evenly throughout the chamber. Therefore, it is advisable to improve the experimental laboratory system to provide better correlation with field results...|$|E
