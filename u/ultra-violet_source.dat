A {{large part of the}} emission comes from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, excited by nearby <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>sources.</b> Can the observed diffuse emission structure be interpreted as column density structure? We discuss this question {{with the help of a}} set of model molecular clouds bathed in the radiation field of a nearby O-star. The correlation strength between column density and "observed" flux density strongly depends on the absolute volume density range in the region. Shadowing and irradiation effects may completely alter the appearance of an object. Irradiation introduces additional small-scale structure and it can generate structures resembling shells around HII-regions in objects that do not possess any shell-like structures whatsoever. Nevertheless, structural information about the underlying interstellar medium can be retrieved. In the more diffuse regime (n(HI) ≲ 100 cm^- 3), flux density maps may be used to trace the 3 D density structure of the cloud via density gradients. Thus, while caution definitely is in order, mid-infrared surveys such as GLIMPSE will provide quantitative insight into the turbulent structure of the interstellar medium...|$|R

40|$|Visible and <b>ultra-violet</b> light <b>sources</b> have {{numerous}} {{applications in}} the fields of solid state lighting, optical data storage, plastic fiber communications, heads-up displays in automobiles, and in quantum cryptography and communications. Most research and development into such sources is being done using III-nitride materials where the emission can be tuned from the deep UV in AlN to the near infrared in InN. However due to material limitations including large strain, piezoelectric polarization, and the unavailability of cheap native substrates, most visible devices are restricted to emission near GaN at 365 nm up to around 530 nm. These dots are formed by the relaxation of strain, and it has been shown both theoretically and experimentally that the piezoelectric field and the resultant quantum confined stark effect are significantly lower than those values reported in comparable QWs. As a result, the radiative carrier lifetimes in such dots are typically around 10 - 100 times smaller than those in equivalent QWs. Furthermore, the quasi-three dimensional confinement of carriers in the InGaN islands that form the dots can reduce carrier migration to (and therefore recombination at) dislocations and other defects. In the present study, molecular beam epitaxial growth and the properties of InGaN/GaN self-assembled quantum dots have been investigated in detail. The quantum dots, emitting at 630 nm, have been studied optically through temperature-dependent, excitation-dependent, and time-resolved photoluminescence. A radiative lifetime of ~ 2 ns has been measured in these samples. Samples with varying number of dot layers were grown and characterized structurally by atomic force microscopy.

Device feature size on wafer turns to be much smaller than the illumination source of nowadays widely used lithography equipments, which is 193 nm wavelength of UV(ultraviolet) light. Diffraction effects can not be avoided when transfer patterns from masks to wafers in the process of lithography because of the extremely small size of features. So the patterns transferred from masks to wafers surface are distorted very much, and it causes many problems, such as poly line end shortening or bridging which result in leakage or short circuit. The industry has been investigating various alternatives, such as EUV(extreme <b>ultra-violet)</b> illumination <b>source.</b> However, the next generation of illumination source, EUV with a wavelength of about 13. 5 nm, {{still has a long way}} to be put into practice. As a result, Resolution Enhancement Technology (RET) has been increasingly relied uponto minimize image distortions. In advanced process nodes, pixelated mask becomes essential for RET to achieve an acceptable resolution. In this thesis, we investigate the problem of pixelated binary mask design in a partially coherent imaging system. Similar to previous approaches, the mask design problem is formulated as a nonlinear program and is solved by gradient based search. Our contributions are four novel techniques to achieve significantly better image quality than state-of-the-art technology. First, to transform the original bound-constrained formulation to an unconstrained optimization problem, we propose a new non-cyclic transformation of mask variables to replace the well-known cyclic one. As our transformation is monotonic, it enables a better control in flipping pixels. Second, based on this new transformation, we propose a highly efficient line search based heuristic technique to solve the resulting unconstrained optimization problem. Third, we introduce a jump technique. As gradient based search techniques will get trapped at a local minimum, we introduce a new technique named jump in order to jump out of the local minimum and continue the search. It increases the chance to achieve a better result. Fourth, to simplify the optimization, instead of using widely used discretization regularization penalty technique, we directly round the optimized gray mask into binary mask for pattern error evaluation.

Mitigation of high voltage rf breakdowns and Q-slope is a major concern in development of higher-field RF cavities for next generation accelerators [3]. Surface treatment by GCIB method has recently been proposed as a new way to significantly reduce the surface roughness and the dark current from the rf-cavity surfaces and enabling operation at higher acceleration gradients [6]. SIMULATION MODELS As an HCI ion approaches a metal or semiconductor surface, the strong Coulomb field of HCI can pull the electrons from the solid surface into the Rydberg states of the ion [7]. The hollow atom (HA) is formed which evolves further by emitting electrons and/or photons via the Auger processes. The potential energy of Xe +q (q ≤ 54) is calculated by a multiconfiguration Dirac–Fock method [8]. The classical over-the-barrier (COB) model [7, 9] is widely used to estimate the distance where the first resonant charge transfer can take place. The life time of HA is much greater than the interaction time: τ I ~ 10 - 13 s [10]. Another physical effect that should be taken into account is electric field screening. We used the screening length for the Coulomb forces between the ions to be 5 Ǻ which is of the order of the Si lattice parameter. A detailed analysis of the previous work on screening processes has been given in Ref. [11, 12].

This method also {{does not require the}} conventional micro-photolithographic technique (i. e., photolithographic masks) for patterning and fabricating polymer structures such as hydrogels. The major materials and methods required for this novel fabrication technology are: (1) any cross-linked network of photoactive polymers (examples of fabricated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) -diacrylate hydrogel structures are shown {{in this paper}}); (2) an Optically-induced Dielectrophoresis (ODEP) System which includes an “ODEP chip” (i. e., any chip that changes its surface conductivity when exposed to visible light), an optical microscope, a projector, and a computer; and (3) an animator software hosted on a computer that can generate virtual or dynamic patterns which can be projected onto the “ODEP chip” {{through the use of a}} projector and a condenser lens. Essentially, by placing a photosensitive polymer solution inside the microfluidic platform formed by the “ODEP chip” bonded to another substrate, and applying an alternating current (a. c.) electrical potential across the polymer solution (typically ~ 20 Vp-p at 10 kHz), solid polymer micro/nano structures can then be formed on the “ODEP chip” surface when visible-light is projected onto the chip. The 2 D lateral geometry (x and y dimensions) and the thickness (height) of the micro/nano structures are dictated by the image geometry of the visible light projected onto the “ODEP chip” and also the time duration of projection. Typically, after an image projection with intensity ranging from ~ 0. 2 to 0. 4 mW/cm 2 for 10 s, ~ 200 nm high structures can be formed. In our current system, the thickness of these polymer structures can be controlled to form from ~ 200 nanometers to ~ 3 micrometers structures. However, in the in-plane dimensions, only ~ 7 μm resolution can be achieved now, due to the optical diffraction limit and the physical dimensions of DMD mirrors in the projector. Nevertheless, with higher quality optical components, the in-plane resolution is expected to be sub-micron...|$|R
40|$|The unique {{properties}} of silver nanoparticles (Ag NP) have been exploited within {{the fields of}} photonics and biotechnology {{over the last decade}} due to their wide range of novel uses and applications. The surface plasmon polariton response of Ag NPs and thin films dispersed onto nm-thin layers of strained silicon (ɛ-Si) grown on Si 1 -xGex virtual substrates can be utilised to provide surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) of the ɛ-Si layer compared to the bulk Si 1 -xGex virtual substrate – overcoming the need to use low resolution, expensive <b>ultra-violet</b> Raman excitation <b>sources.</b> For biological applications it is thought (based on recent work on Au NPs) that Ag NPs can also be applied as effective thermal agents for cancer hyperthermia due to their ability to heat under the influence of a high-power, radiofrequency (RF) electric field operating at 13. 56 MHz – potentially allowing for single-cellular cancer treatment, eliminating the current trends of invasive and life-threatening cancer treatments such as radiation, proton, gene and immunotherapy, and generic surgical resections. In the first instance, thin films of Ag NPs were deposited onto a variety of ɛ-Si samples (9 nm [Ge 30 %], 17. 5 nm [Ge 20 %], and 42 nm [Ge 20 %]) via high pressure, direct thermal evaporation of Ag nanopowder (source-to-substrate distance of 21 cm). Alternatively, Ag NPs synthesised via a chemical reduction technique (polyol process) using poly(vinylpyrrolidone) as the capping agent, as well as citrate stabalised NPs, were also dispersed onto identical samples. Both techniques were analysed for their SERS viability via micro-Raman spectroscopy (488 nm Ar+ excitation source). Where SERS evidence is shown, enhancement factors and strain values are calculated. Evidence is also given to shown that small ɛ-Si peak shifts may be due to point-to-point ɛ-Si strain fluctuations. Where appropriate, the plasmonic origin of the SERS effects are highlighted using SEM and UV-VIS data. For the cell hyperthermia studies the heating efficacies of commercially available Ag and Au NPs, synthesied via citrate reduction techniques, were also investigated by means of a capacitively-coupled RF heating system with a thermal imaging camera. Although there was rapid heat production from the as-purchased Ag NP/buffer solutions, NPs dispersed in ultra-pure high pressure liquid chromatography water were indeed shown to exhibit heat production, albeit on a lesser scale. The fact that buffer heating rates are greater than NP heating rates contradicts recent work as these researchers did not take these heating attributes into account. Theoretical analysis using a metallic volumetric heating equation as a function of NP size and solution volume, combined with a modified metallic conductivity due to a reduction in the electron mean free path, allowed for close similarities between experimental and theoretical values to be drawn. These results have ultimately shown the potential for Ag NPs as single cellular cancer hyperthermic treatment agents – a technique unrivalled by any current existing technology...|$|R

40|$|Fingerprints of {{excitation}} and emission {{spectra of}} chlorophyll and phycobilin fluorescence {{can be used}} to differentiate 'spectral groups' of microalgae in vivo and in situ, e. g. vertical profiles can be taken within a few minutes. The investigated spectral groups of algae (green group - chlorophyta; blue - blue cyanobacteria; brown - heterokontophyta, haptophyta, dinophyta; red - red cyanobacteria and mixed - cryptophyta) are each characterised by a specific composition of photosynthetic antennae pigments and, consequently, by a specific excitation and emission spectrum of the chlorophyll and phycobilin fluorescence. Particularly relevant are chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c, phycocyanin, phycoerythrin, fucoxanthin and peridinin. In a first approach, a laboratory based instrument and a submersible instrument were constructed containing light-emitting diodes to excite chlorophyll fluorescence in five distinct wavelength ranges to facilitate the differentiation of four spectral algal groups (green, blue, brown, mixed). They were measured under a fixed emission wavelength. Norm spectra were determined for the four spectral algal groups (several species per group). Using these norm spectra and the actual five-point excitation spectrum of a water sample, an estimate of the group-specific chlorophyll concentration is rapidly obtained for each algal group. This was accomplished by the development of a fast mathematical fit procedure. In vivo and in situ measurements based on calibration experiments were compared with results obtained by high performance liquid chromatography and biovolume estimations from the light microscope. Depth profiles of the distribution of spectral algal groups taken over a time period of few minutes were shown. The described method for algal differentiation opens new research areas and monitoring and supervision facilities related to photosynthetic primary production in aquatic environments. Yellow substances (coloured dissolved organic matter) may interfere with the measurement because of an overlap of the excitation spectra with those of phytoplankton. The use of an <b>ultra-violet</b> excitation <b>source</b> (370 nm light-emitting diode) enabled differentiation between algal fluorescence and fluorescence by yellow substances. The resulting six-point excitation spectra were deconvoluted on the basis of norm spectra. A mean norm spectrum for yellow substances was obtained from natural samples. In a new submersible instrument the correction of chlorophyll fluorescence measurements for the influence of yellow substances was tested in in vivo and in situ experiments. Specific problems associated with the principle of a free-falling depth profiler for algae discrimination were also considered. When F 0, F and Fm are determined sequentially with one measuring cell, then phytoplankton inside the cell experiences a different light history according to different locations in the cell. This leads to a superposition of different induction curves of chlorophyll fluorescence. Mathematical algorithms were developed that enable theevaluation of the integral fluorescence signal (averaged for 1 s) for different velocities of the falling probe. This yields a correction factor which allows the usage of calibration factors obtained from stationary suspensions for the determination of algal concentrations in flowing suspensions. The predictions of the model were compared with measurements in flowing suspensions containing chlorophyta, cyanobacteria, cryptophyta and diatoms. The comparison showed the reliability of the algorithms. The requirement of corrections by the algorithm was high for dark-adapted cells and less important for light-adapted cells. Fluorometric determination of the chlorophyll content of cyanobacteria is impeded by the unique structure of their photosynthetic apparatus, that is, the phycobilisomes in the lightharvesting antennae. The problems are caused by the variations in the ratio of the pigment phycocyanin to chlorophyll a resulting from adaptation to varying environmental conditions. In order to improve fluorometric analysis of algae a simplified energy distribution model describing energy pathways in the cyanobacterial photosynthetic apparatus was conceptualised. Two sets of mathematical equations were derived from this model and tested. Fluorescence of cyanobacteria was measured with a new fluorometer at seven excitation wavelength ranges and at three detection channels (650 nm, 685 nm and 720 nm) in vivo. By employing a new fit procedure it became possible to correct for variations in the cyanobacterial fluorescence excitation spectra and to account for other phytoplankton signals. The effect of energy state transitions on the phycocyanin fluorescence emission of phycobilisomes were documented. The additional use of the phycocyanin fluorescence signal at 650 nm in combination with the previously developed mathematical approach for phytoplankton analysis based on chlorophyll fluorescence spectroscopy allows a more detailed study of cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton in vivo and in situ. The detection of red cyanobacteria with these newly developed methods is not possible because of adaptation processes of the cyanobacterial photosynthetic apparatus and spectral interferences with cryptophyta. To overcome these problems a simplified energy distribution model accounting for energy pathways in the red cyanobacterial photosynthetic apparatus and the apparatus of cryptophyta was designed. Mathematical equations were derived that enabled the calculation of the pigment content in both organisms: cryptophyta and red cyanobacteria. This resulted in the extension of a fluorometer previously developed for phytoplankton, with seven excitation wavelengths and four detection channels (600 nm, 620 nm, 650 nm and 685 nm). An extension of the fit procedure allowed corrections for variations in the fluorescence excitation spectra of red cyanobacteria and cryptophyta in the presence of other phytoplankton signals. The new approach provided correct fluorometric pigment estimation also in the presence of energy state transitions. The combination of fluorescence emission excitation matrices, the fluorescence models and the enhanced fit algorithm provides valuable information for phytoplankton analysis. Finally, the set-up was tested successfully with natural samples. It enabled the determination of chlorophyll in five spectral groups of phytoplankton and of the phycobilins in three spectral types. A correction for yellow substances was included using mean fluorescence spectra of filtered natural samples. The pigment estimation of this method was compared to reference estimates obtained by high performance liquid chromatography and wet chemicalanalysis of natural freshwater samples. Reference and fluorometric methods showed similar results. This measuring principle was installed as a submersible instrument which makes possible the measurement of fluorescence depth-profiles via pigment estimation in situ in a time scale of a few minutes. Profiles obtained with the instrument were compared to those obtained with the stationary instrument. The correlation between both methods was very high. This demonstrates the success and the large step forward in phytoplankton analysis achieved by this method. Content Chapter [...] . Page Abbreviations [...] . 5 Introduction [...] 7 Chapter 1.
