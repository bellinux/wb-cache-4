5|$|A {{number of}} {{accounts}} {{state that the}} congregation's first synagogue was built at South State and South streets in 1861 and burned by the Union Army in 1863, but the veracity of this claim is disputed. In 1867 the congregation constructed a wood frame building {{at the corner of}} South State and South streets. The building, which was <b>used</b> <b>both</b> as a schoolhouse and for prayer services, was the first synagogue in Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|Danvers carrots. These {{have strong}} foliage and the roots are longer than Chantaney types, {{and they have}} a conical shape with a {{well-defined}} shoulder, tapering to a point. They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are <b>used</b> <b>both</b> fresh and for processing. They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts. Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'.|$|E
50|$|The {{march is}} titled both ways (just as the color can be spelled gray or grey). The Library of Congress’ Catalogue of Copyright Entries <b>uses</b> <b>both</b> Grays and Greys for {{different}} arrangements of the march. Music publishers <b>use</b> <b>both</b> titles. Carl Fischer uses Grays and Barnhouse uses Greys while Kalmus <b>uses</b> <b>both</b> spellings.

5|$|Design and {{operation}} of a distillation column depends on the feed and desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the McCabe–Thiele method or the Fenske equation {{can be used to}} assist in the design. For a multi-component feed, computerized simulation models are <b>used</b> <b>both</b> for design and subsequently in operation of the column as well. Modeling is also used to optimize already erected columns for the distillation of mixtures other than those the distillation equipment was originally designed for.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Marcelo Weksler {{published}} a large-scale cladistic analysis of Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), the group (tribe) to which hammondi {{and the related}} species mentioned above belong. He <b>used</b> <b>both</b> morphological and molecular characters, but had only morphological data for Oryzomys hammondi. The placement of the species in his results was unstable; some trees placed it close to the tree rice rats, Oecomys, within clade B and others placed it as an isolated lineage, basal to all other Oryzomyini.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} {{involved}} in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent around the country to encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were <b>used</b> <b>both</b> to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories. One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.|$|E

5|$|Military {{camouflage}} patterns {{have been}} popular in fashion and art from {{as early as}} 1915. Camouflage patterns {{have appeared in the}} work of artists such as Andy Warhol and Ian Hamilton Finlay, sometimes with an anti-war message. In fashion, many major designers have exploited camouflage's style and symbolism, and military clothing or imitations of it have been <b>used</b> <b>both</b> as street wear and as a symbol of political protest.|$|E
5|$|Paintings {{of early}} modernist {{painters}} such as Damián Domingo often {{still had a}} religious association but the art of Juan Luna and Félix Hidalgo showed a trend towards political statement. The first Philippine national artist Fernando Amorsolo used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated aspects of Philippine culture, while other artists such as Fernando Zóbel <b>used</b> <b>both</b> realistic and abstract techniques.|$|E

He had the best economy rate of 1.57 runs per over, ahead of Toshack's 1.81; Bradman <b>used</b> <b>both</b> in a defensive manner.

5|$|The {{existence}} of the different scales means that {{care must be taken}} when comparing large numbers between languages or countries, or when interpreting old documents in countries where the dominant scale has changed over time. For example, British English, French, and Italian historical documents can refer to either the short or long scale, depending on the date of the document, since each of the three countries has <b>used</b> <b>both</b> systems at various times in its history. Today, the United Kingdom officially uses the short scale, but France and Italy use the long scale.|$|E

5|$|The park's {{name comes}} from the Manor of Hyde, which was the {{northeast}} sub-division of the manor of Eia (the other two sub-divisions were Ebury and Neyte) and appears as such in the Domesday Book. The name {{is believed to be}} of Saxon origin, and means a unit of land, the hide, that was appropriate for the support of a single family and dependents. Through the Middle Ages, it was property of Westminster Abbey, and the woods in the manor were <b>used</b> <b>both</b> for firewood and shelter for game.|$|E
5|$|The {{reverse of}} countershading, with the belly {{pigmented}} {{darker than the}} back, enhances contrast and so makes animals more conspicuous. It is found in animals that can defend themselves, such as skunks. The pattern is <b>used</b> <b>both</b> in startle or deimatic displays and as a signal to warn off experienced predators. However, animals that habitually live upside-down but lack strong defences, like the Nile catfish and the luna moth caterpillar, have upside-down countershading for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|When the Umayyad Muslims {{invaded the}} Iberian {{peninsula}} in 711 AD, their invasion brought Barb horses, which were crossed with native Iberian horses.

Called the Iberian war horse, this ancestor of the Lusitano was <b>used</b> <b>both</b> on the battlefield and in major riding academies throughout Europe. Bullfighting on horseback and displays of high school dressage were common entertainment for the Portuguese gentry.|$|E
