The mutation {{creates a new}} binding motif for Ets transcription factors and ternary complex factors (TCFs) near the transcription start and, in reporter gene assays, caused up to twofold increase in transcription. We then screened the TERT promoter in sporadic melanoma and observed recurrent <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>signature</b> somatic mutations in 125 of 168 (74 %) of human cell lines derived from metastatic melanomas, 45 of 53 corresponding metastatic tumor tissues (85 %), and 25 of 77 (33 %) primary melanomas.

40|$|Patients {{suffering}} from epidermodysplasia verruciformis {{are prone to}} nonmelanoma skin cancers, due to an inherited abnormal susceptibility to the oncogenic human papillomavirus type 5. Genotoxic sunlight ultraviolet B radiations {{are likely to be}} a cofactor. Lesions of two human-papillomavirus-type- 5 -infected epidermodysplasia verruciformis patients collected during an 8 y period were retrospectively studied for p 53 mutations in exons 5 through 8 by a polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism technique and/or by DNA sequencing of amplified exons. Mutations were detected in 11 of 26 (42. 3 %) specimens, including five (62. 5 %) squamous cell carcinomas, three (33. 3 %) Bowen's carcinomas in situ, two (40 %) actinic keratoses, and one (33 %) benign lesion. The nine mutations characterized by sequencing were shown to be missense and to affect mutational hotspots in human cancers. Five were C→T transitions at dicytidine sites considered as <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>signature</b> mutations. Two were transversions (C→G and C→A) at dicytidine sites and two were C→T transitions at nondipyrimidine sites. A marked p 53 immunoreactivity was disclosed in 72. 7 % of 11 invasive carcinomas, 55. 6 % of nine carcinomas in situ, 37. 5 % of eight actinic keratoses, and one of three benign lesions. This includes 81. 8 % of 11 specimens with a p 53 mutation but also 50 % of 14 specimens with no mutation detected. A dysfunction of the p 53 gene is thus likely to play a part in epidermodysplasia verruciformis carcinogenesis, either due to ultraviolet-B-induced p 53 mutations, as in nonmelanoma skin cancers in the general population, or involving other mutagens or mechanisms.

40|$|The Lyman-alpha auroral {{emission}} {{is characterized}} by a broad line profile whose shape depends on the energy and pitch angle distributions of the initial proton beam, whereas its total brightness reflects the proton energy flux precipitated into the auroral upper atmosphere. Global remote sensing of the proton aurora through its <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>signature</b> makes it is increasingly important to relate the characteristics of the Lyman-alpha emission to the physical properties of the precipitated proton flux. We present a numerical model of proton and hydrogen flux transport and kinetics based on the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. In this approach, all elastic and inelastic processes are stochastically simulated as well as is the production of Lyman-alpha photons with the associated Doppler velocity component. The model also includes collisional, geomagnetic, and geometric spreading of the proton-hydrogen beam. We show that consideration of the stochastic character of the H atom velocity redistribution after collisions produces line profiles different from those obtained in the strictly forward or mean scattering angle approximations previously used in proton transport codes. In particular, the predicted fraction of photons due to backscattered particles is considerably larger when stochastic collision scattering is considered than in the strictly forward or mean scattering angle approximations. In contrast to the median wavelength, the position of the peak in the line profile shows a weak inverse dependence on the proton energy. The efficiency of the Lyman-alpha photon production per unit incident energy flux significantly drops as the mean proton energy increases. The line profile and the amount of blue-shifted (for downward viewing) emission depends in a complex way on the initial energy and pitch angle distribution of the protons. The line profiles expected for the noon cusp and midnight proton aurora are shown to be significantly different. Peer reviewe...|$|E

A critical feature of models of combustion is something {{shared by many}} areas of science; namely, the need to assess and characterize {{the role played by}} structural isomers in chemistry. In this thesis structural isomers of benzene derivatives, some of which lead directly to polyaromatic hydrocarbon formation, were studied. A supersonic jet was used to cool these molecules into their zero-point levels. Then, various laser-based spectroscopies were used to provide the infrared and <b>ultraviolet</b> spectral <b>signatures</b> of individual structural isomers free from interference from one another. ^ Unique infrared and <b>ultraviolet</b> spectral <b>signatures</b> of ortho-, meta-, and para-ethynyl styrenes (oES, mES, and pES), para- and meta-divinylbenzene (pDVB and mDVB), 3 -benzyl- 1, 5 -hexadiyne (BHD), 5 -phenyl- 1 -pentyne (PP), and 4 -phenyl- 1 -butyne (PB) were obtained. These studies showed that mES, mDVB, BHD, PP, and PB all have multiple conformations present in the expansion. Assignments of individual conformations were made for BHD, PP, and PB based on the observed and calculated frequencies in the alkyl and acetylenic CH stretch regions, S 0 -S 1 electronic origin shifts, and rotational band contour analysis. High resolution fluorescence excitation studies were used to assign the two conformations of m ES. ^ Armed with this foundation of spectroscopic data on individual conformational isomers, detailed studies of the conformational isomerization dynamics were carried out on mES and mDVB. These studies used the method of stimulated emission pumping-population-transfer spectroscopy (SEP-PT) as a means to place narrow bounds on the energy thresholds for isomerization between individual reactant-product isomer pairs. This method utilizes selective excitation of a single conformation by means of SEP in the early portions of the gas-phase expansion, followed by collisional re-cooling of the vibrationally excited population into the conformational minima for subsequent conformation-specific detection. These studies were used to determine the thresholds for isomerization, the relative energies of the different conformations in the ground state, and the pathways for isomerization. In addition, single vibronic level fluorescence studies were used to fit the vinyl torsional levels observed in m DVB to obtain the barrier to isomerization in a second manner. ...|$|R

To search for additional driver mutations in this tumor type we carried out whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing of 28 tumors or primary cell lines. These samples have a low mutation burden, with a mean of 10. 6 protein changing mutations per sample (range 0 to 53). As expected for these sun-shielded melanomas the mutation spectrum was not consistent with an <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation <b>signature,</b> instead, a BRCA mutation signature predominated. In addition to mutations in the known UM driver genes, we found a recurrent mutation in PLCB 4 (c. G 1888 T, p. D 630 Y, NM_ 000933), which was validated using Sanger sequencing. The identical mutation was also found in published UM sequence data (1 of 56 tumors), supporting its role as a novel driver mutation in UM. PLCB 4 p. D 630 Y mutations are mutually exclusive with mutations in GNA 11 and GNAQ, consistent with PLCB 4 being the canonical downstream target of the former gene products.

The tethered system is to be flown in a gravity-gradient stabilized configuration with a 70 deg circular orbit at altitudes in the range 300 - 800 km.

40|$|This thesis {{has as its}} theme the conformation-specific {{spectroscopy}} and isomerization {{dynamics of}} flexible benzene derivatives. These substituted benzenes were studied because of their relation to combustible fuels. Studying the conformation-specific spectroscopy and dynamics {{of these types of}} molecules is relevant to the isomerspecific chemistry and rates of reaction of large molecules that make up the pathways to soot formation during the process of combustion. In our experiment, a supersonic expansion was utilized to cool the gas-phase molecules into their respective zero-point levels where various laser-based spectroscopic methods were implemented to obtain their conformation-specific infrared and <b>ultraviolet</b> spectral <b>signatures.</b> ^ The <b>ultraviolet</b> and infrared spectra of 5 -phenyl- 1 -pentene and bis(2 -hydroxyphenyl) methane were obtained. Ultraviolet hole-burning spectroscopy revealed that multiple conformational isomers exist in free jet environment for both molecules. The different conformations were assigned to specific structures by comparing experimental spectra to the results of density functional and ab initio calculations. This information was then used to study the dynamics of isomerization between conformations with stimulated emission pumping –population transfer spectroscopy (SEP-PTS). SEPPTS was previously developed in our laboratory as a means to directly measure the barriers to isomerization between specific X→Y conformer pairs. When applied to 5 -phenyl- 1 -pentene and bis(2 -hydroxyphenyl) methane, we obtained bounds on the isomerization barriers, relative energies of the minima, and were able to deduce from this data key aspects of the preferred pathways to isomerization. In the case of bis(2 -hydroxyphenyl) methane, SEP-PTS was also utilized to elucidate the rate of collisional cooling in the supersonic expansion. ^ The second part of this work is aimed at understanding the complicated spectroscopy of flexible bichromophores. Here the bichromophores of bis(2 -hydroxyphenyl) methane and diphenylmethane are discussed. Both molecules possess two ultraviolet chromophores in close proximity to one another, resulting in fascinating spectroscopy depending on the relative orientation and distance between the two chromophores. Diphenylmethane was particularly interesting because very detailed information about the interchromophore electronic coupling was extracted. These are the first state-to-state studies of internal mixing, which uncovered a break-down in vibronic coupling selection rules by virtue of the close energy spacing between the two electronic states. ...|$|R

Fisheries managers have attempted to minimize negative ecological and genetic interactions between hatchery and wild fish by using parr-smolt acclimation facilities to ensure successful olfactory imprinting and homing fidelity. However, the effectiveness of offsite acclimation for returning adults to targeted locations has been mixed. Since laboratory and field studies indicate that the period of hatching and emergence from the natal gravel is a sensitive period for olfactory imprinting, we propose an alternative imprinting approach wherein salmon are exposed as embryos to targeted waters transferred to their rearing hatchery. To test the feasibility of this approach, we conducted a series of electrophysiological and behavioral experiments to determine whether water can be successfully transferred, stored, and treated for pathogens without jeopardizing its chemical integrity.

An increased expression of Ki 67 after UVA 1 and visible light were observed {{as a sign of}} increased proliferation. By comparison to untreated skin, increased expression of p 53 protein, but not p 21 WAF- 1, in epidermis after UVA 1 and only slightly increased expression after visible light were seen. These results suggested that suberythemal doses of UVA 1 - and even visible light - may cause DNA damage. Single p 53 positive cells from UVA 1 irradiated, earlier sun-shielded, skin were therefore microdissected and thereafter PCR-amplified with p 53 sequence analysis. This showed three mutations, all GgT transversion. One of the mutations was found in codon 231 of exon 7 and the other two in the intron. The average mutation was I per 8700 bases or 1 per 12 cells, correlating well with the earlier findings of <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>signature</b> mutations in normal sunexposed human skin. The wavelength at which the dye laser operates is in the visible range commonly used in treating port-wine stains (PWS). The treatment result depends on the wavelength, pulse duration and fluence of the laser system. Twenty-two patients with PWS were treated with flashlamp-pulsed dye laser (FPDL) using wavelengths 585 and 600 nm There was significantly less lightening with 600 run than with 585 nm when equal fluences were used. When 1. 5 and 2 times the 585 nm fluence were applied with 600 nm, the lightening was equal to that of 585 nm. We compared the FPDL at 0. 45 msec pulse duration and spot size 5 mm with an argonpumped dye laser with a robotized scanning laser handpiece (Hexascan) at 70 - 190 msec pulse duration and spot size I mm. Both were tuned to 585 nm. Thirty patients with PWS were treated on test areas with both laser systems. Twelve weeks later the degree of lightening was evaluated and biopsies were taken. The skin sections were immunohistochemically stained with CD 34 to count the vessels. The clinical result showed a significant better lightening using the flashlamp-pulsed dye laser. The histological result showed significantly fewer vessels of diameter larger than 20 pin in treated PWS than in untreated, but no difference between the two laser types. However, there was a tendency towards more small vessels (diameter < 10 µm) after one treatment with the FPDL compared to untreated. Mycosis fungoides (NU) is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma commonly treated with psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA). In photodynamic therapy (PDT) porphyrin-based photosensitizers are used which absorb light energy resulting in cellular damage. We used the prodrug 5 aminolevulinic acid topically on MF lesions.
