The study highlights the major differences between products offered by Islamic versus traditional financial institutions. It is argued that these differences do not necessarily affect the measures of profitability and performance. The main finding of the paper is that stockholders of Islamic financial institutions in the <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E.</b> were willing to pay a premium for their Islamic faith. This highlights the <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E.</b> clientele preference for institutions that closely follow Islamic laws. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{feasibility}} of an export-geared building industrialization in the United Arab Emirates, {{and to develop a}} tentative strategy for the implementation of such industrialization. The United Arab Emirates (<b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E),</b> <b>a</b> rapidly growing country, is chosen as the subject of this study, mainly because oil, which triggered the wealth and rapid development, is regarded by the government as an essential but temporary source of income; and a national policy to diversify the country's industrial development is, therefore, being pursued. Industrialization of the building sector is advocated in this thesis, as part of this diversification scheme. The first chapter summarizes the situation in the <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E</b> in terms of geographical, vital, and economical statistics. The second chapter outlines the components of the Alpha - Beta Model (Grant, D.), the Method of Paired Comparison, and the Churchmann Ackoff Method for Weighting Objectives, as a formal means to evaluate and define the most appropriate industrialization approach. The third chapter applies these methods to the <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E's</b> context, by evaluating the "open systems" and the "closed systems" approaches against selected objectives, derived for the data analysis.

In selecting the <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E.</b> as <b>a</b> case study, a historical and socioeconomic perspective is adopted. The thesis analyses the <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E.</b> traditional society {{and the effect of}} external factor namely its relation with Britain, and internal factor, viz, the advent of oil wealth, on the power structure in the emirates. Both factors increased the concentration of central power and decreased popular participation. The study provides a theoretical appraisal of the role and functions of the legislature in developing countries. It examines the constitutional functions namely legislative, political and financial. The study suggests new roles that the legislatures performs in Third World countries. The thesis examines the historical development of the <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E.</b> constitutional system. Such development ended In 1971 when the emirates adopted a "Provisional Constitution" to the requirements of the rulers.

Anthropogenic surface emissions database used as input for this model are mainly based on some public global international databases like EDGAR (Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research), RETRO (REanalysis of the TROpospheric chemical composition over the past 40 years), GEIA (Global Emissions Inventory Activity) and POET (Precursors of Ozone and their Effects in the Troposphere). Climatologic concentrations of particulate matters derived from GOCART (Georgia Tech/Goddard Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation Transport) model, were used to deduce the corresponding aerosols fluxes for input to WRF-Chem. Most of the data offered by these databases are based on monthly estimations for year 2000. They are complemented by some point emissions estimated for the existing oil fields in the Gulf region. Some local United Arab Emirates point emissions are also used to complement and calibrate this set of data. Despite the low resolution of the area global emissions and the weak density of the local point emissions, it has been found that WRF-Chem simulates quite well the diurnal variation of the chemical species concentrations over <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E</b> region.

40|$|ABSTRACT: At 240 N, the <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E.</b> has <b>an</b> arid, {{subtropical}} climate, with {{an annual}} temperature range 50 to 0 °C. This causes a widespread occurrence of carbonates and evaporites, and the restricted character of the vegetation, though diurnal dews, associated with onshore late afternoon and evening winds, support vegetation on dunes at the shoreline and near shore hillsides. In the eastern <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E.,</b> barrier islands are positioned on a narrow shelf with little protection from heavy seas. They have steep beach faces landward of which are subaerial dunes that are greater than 5 m in height. In contrast in the western <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E.</b> landward of the Khor al Bazam and west of Abu Al Abyad, parallel sets of small subaerial dunes 1 to 2 m in height are common along the landward edge of a broad intertidal platform. These local dunes closer to the sea and areas of higher topography are colonized and stabilized by the halophyte, Salicornia sp. The occurrence of these halophytes appears to be {{directly related to the}} occurrence of diurnal dews. The wetting effect of the dews dies out landward across the dune belt, and is matched by a corresponding loss of vegetation and the deflation of the dunes. The inner lagoons of the Holocene shallow-water carbonate and supratidal evaporite tract that lines the <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E.</b> are rimmed by a series of stranded and deflated beach ridges that now lack dune ridges, formed {{at the end of the}} last major sea level change some 3000 to 4000 years BP.

40|$|United Arab Emirates (<b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E.)</b> is {{suffering}} {{almost all the}} year by the consequences of visibility reduction caused either by persistent dust and haze episodes or by the occurrence of thick fogs especially over marine and costal regions. Visibility drop due to fog usually happens during late night and early morning and could last several hours before dissipation. The <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E</b> coastal fogs are generally advective caused by the north westerly surface flow draining huge amounts of moisture from the Arabian Gulf sea strait to the 600 km <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E</b> western and southern coasts. The large contrast in temperature between land and sea especially during winter season accelerates the condensation process over land near the surface, and contributes to the formation of low stratiform clouds close to the surface since the very beginning of night time. The Weather Research and Forecasting model is among the tools used by the forecasters for fog prediction. It offers a large number of prognostic and diagnostic fog predictability parameters. However, UAE WRF is not always successful in predicting fog formation. Recently, during February and March 2008, among more than 10 thick fog situations, only 6 were correctly predicted. This study aims the scientific evaluation of multiple WRF fog ingredients like physical parameterizations schemes (microphysics, radiation, planetary boundary layer, surface, horizontal diffusion), horizontal and vertical resolution, assimilation techniques (3 D-Var, Nudging), over a series of 2008 winter and spring fog situations.

Their previous food habits have been looked into in comparison with the present style of life in <b>U.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>E.</b> The present study revealed that mother's milk is showing an increase in the level of aflatoxin contamination. The level of AFM; in mother's milk was as high as 3 ng / ml and, from 445 mother donors, AFM 1 was detected in 99. 5 % of mother's breast milk. Analysis of the data shows no significant correlation between nationalities and total fat content of mother's milk with the level of AFM 1. However, a detailed analysis of the composition of the milk fat revealed that milk rich in saturated fatty acid may be associated with high level of aflatoxin M 1. In contrast milk containing high AFM 1 usually had low levels of linoleic acid. High concentration of Lactose, the sole carbohydrate in human milk, has no association with AFM 1 levels. It was found that a high protein content in the diet may be associated with high AFM 1, in the mother's milk.
