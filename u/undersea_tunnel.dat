25|$|Great Istanbul Tunnel, a {{proposed}} three-level road-rail <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1939, a Japanese Railway official, Yumoto Noboru, {{wrote of}} a trans-Eurasian railway to link Japan to its Axis partner, Germany, and {{proposed}} {{the construction of}} an <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> to connect Japan with Korea via the island of Tsushima. It was argued a combined <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> and land link would help safeguard Japanese communications and shipments to and from Europe, which would be imperiled by a Pacific War.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, the South Korean Busan Development Institute {{estimated}} the <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> could create ₩54 trillion won (원54T, or US$53 billion) in economic benefits and provide about 45,000 jobs.|$|E
5000|$|Eurasia <b>Tunnel,</b> <b>undersea</b> road <b>tunnel,</b> {{crossing}} the Bosphorus and connecting the Asian and European sides of Istanbul.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of mountain crossings, tunnels through mountains, bridges, undersea tunnels; {{many of these}} projects, particularly the larger bridges and the <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels,</b> were undertaken {{as late as the}} 1970s forward.|$|R
50|$|Giske Bridge {{was opened}} in 1987 {{and had a}} toll until 2009. Together with the nearby <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels,</b> the bridge {{is part of the}} Vigra Fixed Link which connects the islands of Giske Municipality with the nearby city of Ålesund.|$|R
25|$|Starting from June 2013, {{suburban}} {{lines on}} both sides of the city (Istanbul suburban and Haydarpaşa suburban) were closed for rehabilitation works as well as for their fusion into a single line by the means of an <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> through the Bosphorus as part of the Marmaray project.|$|E
25|$|Noboru's {{writing was}} {{joined in the}} same year by a {{recommendation}} from a Mr. Kuwabara, who would later assist {{in the creation of the}} undersea Seikan Tunnel, currently the world's longest <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel.</b> In 1939 Kuwabara made the same recommendation of tunneling across the strait and connecting to a 'Cross Asian Railway'. Studies were soon conducted by the Japanese government on a possible Kampu (Shimonoseki-Busan) tunnel between the Japanese home islands and South Korea. The plan came under serious consideration starting in 1941.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark (completed 1997) and the Øresund Bridge-Tunnel (completed 1999), linking Denmark with Sweden, {{provided}} a highway and railroad connection between Sweden and the Danish mainland (the Jutland Peninsula, precisely the Zealand). The <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> of the Øresund Bridge-Tunnel provides for navigation of large ships {{into and out}} of the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea is the main trade route for export of Russian petroleum. Many of the countries neighboring the Baltic Sea have been concerned about this, since a major oil leak in a seagoing tanker would be disastrous for the Baltic—given the slow exchange of water. The tourism industry surrounding the Baltic Sea is naturally concerned about oil pollution.|$|E
5|$|The South Korean {{government}} announced on 2 December 2009 {{that it would}} conduct an economic and technical study on the feasibility of constructing <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels</b> for transporting goods and people {{to and from the}} country directly to Kyushu, Japan and Shandong, China.|$|R
50|$|The Kanmon Railway Tunnel, Kanmon Roadway Tunnel, and Shin-Kanmon <b>Tunnel</b> are <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{crossing}} the Kanmon Straits between Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi, and Kitakyushu, Fukuoka in western Japan. When opened in 1942, the railway tunnel provided the first {{direct link between}} Honshu and Kyushu, two of Japan's four main islands.|$|R
50|$|Crossing the Bohai Strait, {{the tunnel}} would be 123 km long, 90 km of it under water. This would exceed the {{combined}} lengths {{of the two}} longest <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels</b> on Earth, the Seikan Tunnel and the Channel tunnel. The tunnel is planned to run more than 100 km under the Strait.|$|R
25|$|In an April 2009 editorial, former Justice Ministers Daizō Nozawa of Japan and Kim Ki Chun of South Korea {{remarked on}} some of the {{similarities}} of the proposed Japan–Korea tunnel to the world's present longest <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The Channel Tunnel runs for 50.45km linking the United Kingdom and France, and opened in May 1994: At 37.9km, the tunnel has the longest undersea portion of any tunnel in the world. The Japan–Korea tunnel faces technical issuesand similarly the mistrust of two former adversaries created by centuries of conflict. However, the UK and France were able to overlook their historical divide and link themselves, setting the stage for a major change in their relationship.|$|E
25|$|Transportation {{has long}} {{played a role}} in the shaping of East Boston. Clipper ships were built at the {{shipyard}} owned by Donald McKay in the mid-19th century. A subway tunnel connecting the neighborhood to the rest of the city opened in 1904 and was the first <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> of its kind in the United States. Rows of houses were torn down to build the Sumner Tunnel in 1934 and the Callahan Tunnel in 1961, directly connecting automobile traffic from downtown Boston. In the early 1920s, an airfield was built, and eventually it was expanded to become Logan International Airport. The eastern terminus of Interstate 90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike) has been at Route 1A next to Logan Airport since 2003, and the newer Ted Williams Tunnel (1995) links I-90 from East Boston to the rest of the city.|$|E
25|$|Wan Chai's Gloucester Road, a east-west {{trunk route}} along the {{northern}} coast, is connected to Cross-Harbour Tunnel, the first <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> in Hong Kong. This tunnel {{is connected to the}} south by a direct viaduct from its landing point on Hong Kong Island to the Aberdeen Tunnel towards the southern coast. Connecting Hong Kong Island at Kellet Island (the site of the Royal Navy Club) to a reclaimed site at Hung Hom Bay in Kowloon, this tunnel provides a direct link by road. Prior to the tunnel's opening in 1972, local drivers and pedestrians depended solely upon the Star Ferry services to cross the Victoria Harbour. Linking the main financial districts on both sides of Victoria Harbour, the tunnel carries 123,000 vehicles daily. On the other hand, the thoroughfare Queen's Road East, an extension from Queen's Road West at Kennedy Town, through Queen's Road Central at Central, Queensway at Admiralty, takes a southerly route to provide an alternative east-west road link. Due to Wan Chai's early involvement in the British colonial administration, road names were often taken from previous Governors, such as Hennessy Road, and notable people (Gloucester Road, Jaffé Road, Lockhart Road, Johnston Road, Fleming Road, Luard Road, O'Brien Road, Marsh Road, Stewart Road, McGregor Street, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Finnøy {{island is}} {{connected}} to the mainland by a series of bridges and <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels.</b> Finnøy Tunnel connects Finnøy to the nearby island of Rennesøy, and to the nearby island of Talgje. Finnøy also has regular ferry connections to most of the islands which surround it such as Ombo, Sjernarøyane, Halsnøya, and Fogn.|$|R

50|$|The European road E10 {{connects the}} larger islands of Lofoten with bridges and <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The E10 road also connects Lofoten to the {{mainland}} of Norway through the Lofast road connection, which was officially opened on December 1, 2007. There are several daily bus services between the islands of Lofoten and between Lofoten and the mainland along E10.|$|R
500|$|An <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{between the}} {{archipelago}} and Caithness, at {{a length of}} about [...] and a tunnel connecting Orkney Mainland to Shapinsay have been discussed, although little has come of it.|$|E
500|$|On 15 December 2011, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin {{announced}} that a rail link was being considered between Sakhalin Island and Japan. [...] The rail line, constructed in an <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel,</b> would link Japan to the Trans-Siberian.|$|E
500|$|The Port of Miami Tunnel (also State Road 887) is a [...] bored, <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> in Miami, Florida. It {{consists}} of two parallel tunnels (one in each direction) that travel beneath Biscayne Bay, connecting the MacArthur Causeway on Watson Island with PortMiami on Dodge Island. It was built in a public–private partnership between three government entities—the Florida Department of Transportation, Miami-Dade County, and the City of Miami—and the private entity MAT Concessionaire LLC, which {{was in charge of}} designing, building, and financing the project and holds a 31-year concession to operate the tunnel.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipality}} borders Røyken to the north. To {{the west}} the coastline is located {{close to the}} eastern coast of Vestfold with Svelvik. It {{is connected to the}} eastern side of the Oslofjord via Oslofjordtunnel, one of the longest <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels</b> of its kind in Northern Europe. The tunnel is 7.2 km long and connects Hurumhalvøya to Akershus county.|$|R
5000|$|The 0.31 km2 {{village has}} a {{population}} (2013) of 662, giving the village a population density of 2135 /km2. [...] It {{is located at the}} entrance to two <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The Ellingsøy Tunnel leads to the city of Ålesund on the nearby island of Nørvøya and the Valderøy Tunnel leads to the island of Valderøya in neighboring Giske Municipality.|$|R
5000|$|... "Water tiles" [...] {{are also}} divided into several types. After {{submarines}} are available, {{the type of}} tile in oceans can be seen (e.g. continental shelf, deep sea trench, rift, etc.). Once the technology for sea colonies is discovered, <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels</b> can be built to link to other sea colonies and dry land. Fisheries and undersea mines can also be built to produce resources.|$|R
2500|$|The Japan–Korea <b>Undersea</b> <b>Tunnel</b> (also Korea–Japan <b>Undersea</b> <b>Tunnel)</b> is a {{proposed}} tunnel project to connect Japan with South Korea via an <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> crossing the Korea Strait using the strait islands of Iki and Tsushima, a straight-line distance of approximately [...] at its shortest.|$|E
2500|$|Sakhalin–Hokkaido Tunnel, a {{proposed}} Russia–Japan <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> and possible competitor to the Japan–Korea tunnel project ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Bechtel {{was awarded}} a {{contract}} for project management services of an <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> linking the UK and France called the Channel Tunnel or [...] "Chunnel." [...] The tunnel was completed in 1994.|$|E

Strange lights on the nearby mysterious island leads to the four's first {{adventure}} inside an abandoned copper mine and a network of secret <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since 1992, Rennesøy {{municipality}} {{has been}} {{connected to the}} mainland {{by a series of}} bridges and <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The Byfjord Tunnel connects the mainland to the island of Sokn, and {{it is part of the}} European route E39 highway. The island of Sokn is connected to the three islands of Åmøy, Bru, and Mosterøy by bridges. Mosterøy is connected to Fjøløy and Klosterøy by short bridges and to Rennesøy by the <b>undersea</b> Mastrafjord <b>Tunnel.</b> Rennesøy island is also connected to the island of Vestre Bokn (across the Boknafjorden) by ferry. Furthermore, the island of Rennesøy is connected to the two islands of Finnøy and Talgje in the neighboring municipality of Finnøy to the northeast by the Finnøy Tunnel.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2009 Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama (鳩山 由紀夫) visited Seoul and had {{discussions that}} led to two proposals: an <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> between Japan and South Korea being one of those. It was {{announced}} {{at the conclusion of}} his meetings that a research group from the two countries would convene in January 2010 to establish a tunnel building committee. Speaking earlier at the United Nations General Assembly, Hatoyama indicated that the recent changes in Japan would help his nation be a [...] "bridge" [...] to the world. To build a unity of nations, Hatoyama wanted to establish an East Asian Community similar to the European Union. An <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> between the two countries would help establish that unity.|$|E
2500|$|Suggestions for the {{possibility}} of an <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> linking Lewis and Harris to the Scottish mainland were raised in early 2007. One of the possible routes, between Stornoway and Ullapool, would be over [...] long and hence become the longest road tunnel in the world.|$|E
2500|$|There are ideas being {{discussed}} {{to build the}} Orkney Tunnel, an <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnel</b> between Orkney and the Scottish Mainland, at a length of about [...] or (more likely) one connecting Orkney Mainland to Shapinsay. The Orkney-Caithness route would be connected to Mainland, via the Churchill Barriers, but would make landfall on South Ronaldsay, if constructed.|$|E
50|$|Earlier {{there were}} ferries between Vestmanna on Streymoy {{and the island}} of Vágar to the west, where the airport is, {{and there was a}} ferry {{connection}} from Leirvík on Eysturoy island to Klaksvík on Borðoy in the Northern Islands, but after the <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels</b> between these areas came, there was no longer any need for the ferries. The Norðoyatunnilin now connects Eysturoy with Klaksvík, and the Vágatunnilin connects Streymoy with Vágar.|$|R
50|$|Judaberg is a {{transportation}} {{hub of the}} island municipality with several ferry routes connecting to all the surrounding islands such as Ombo, Sjernarøyane, Halsnøya, and Fogn {{as well as to}} the village of Nedstrand on the mainland. There is also high speed ferry service to the city of Stavanger. Judaberg is connected to the mainland by road by a series of bridges and <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels</b> including the Finnøy Tunnel, Mastrafjord Tunnel, and Byfjord Tunnel.|$|R
50|$|Roaldis {{a village}} in Giske Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. The village {{is located on the}} {{northern}} part of the island Vigra. Roald is about 20 km north of the city centre of Ålesund, connected via two <b>undersea</b> <b>tunnels</b> which opened in 1987 (and will be going through extensive upgrades starting in 2008). Ålesund Airport, Vigra is 2 km south of the village of Roald. Vigra Church is located a short distance south of Roald.|$|R
