5|$|Cynthia Lennon {{personally}} {{believed that}} Mardas invented {{the story about}} sexual impropriety to <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> Maharishi's influence on the Beatles, as Mardas was always jealous of anyone having Lennon's attention.

In 2010, Mardas issued a statement denying that he had spread rumours.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{resignation}} of CIA director George Tenet in 2004, Bush nominated Porter Goss to head the agency. The White House ordered Goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration. After Goss' appointment, many of the CIA's senior agents were fired or quit.

5|$|Philip {{realized}} that the sole intention of the Athenian support for Argeus was to recover Amphipolis (see below), which they hoped to do by placing Argeus on the throne.

However, García declined the offer. He believed that a larger force might <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> efficiency of their work. Jose Alejandrino, the chief army engineer and one of Luna's aides, stated that he never heard of García and his unit again after Luna's resignation on February 28.|$|E

5|$|Hitler was {{discharged}} from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP. The party headquarters was in Munich, a hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> Weimar Republic. In February 1921—already highly effective at speaking to large audiences—he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000. To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.|$|E
5|$|On 17 February 1644, Jirgalang, who was {{a capable}} {{military}} leader but looked uninterested in managing state affairs, willingly yielded control of all official matters to Dorgon. After an alleged plot by Hooge to <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> regency was exposed on 6 May of that year, Hooge was stripped of his title of Imperial Prince and his co-conspirators were executed. Dorgon soon replaced Hooge's supporters (mostly from the Yellow Banners) with his own, thus gaining closer control of two more Banners. By early June 1644, he was in firm control of the Qing government and its military.|$|E

5|$|Secretary of War Edwin Stanton was an {{able and}} {{hard-working}} man, but {{difficult to deal}} with. Johnson both admired and was exasperated by his War Secretary, who, in combination with General of the Army Grant, worked to <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> president's Southern policy from within his own administration. Johnson considered firing Stanton, but respected him for his wartime service as secretary. Stanton, for his part, feared allowing Johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign, despite his public disagreements with his president.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-American {{immigrants}} {{residing in}} newly-independent Texas overwhelmingly desired immediate annexation by the United States. But, despite his {{strong support for}} Texas independence from Mexico, then-President Andrew Jackson delayed recognizing the new republic until {{the last day of}} his presidency to avoid raising the issue during the 1836 general election. Jackson's political caution was informed by northern concerns that Texas could potentially form several new slave states and <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> North-South balance in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Shafi'i {{school of}} thought accepts qiyas as a valid source. Imam Shafi'i, however, {{considered}} it a weak source, and tried to limit the cases where jurists would need to resort to qiyas. He criticized and rejected analogical deductions that were not firmly rooted in the Qur'an and sunnah. According to Shafi'i, if analogical deductions were not strictly rooted in primary sources, they would have adverse effects. One such consequence could be variety of different rulings in the same subject. Such a situation, he argued, would <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> predictability and uniformity of a sound legal system.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} {{suggestions}} that leaf shedding {{may be a}} response that provides protection against diseases and certain kinds of pests such as leaf miners and gall forming insects.
