40|$|Soon {{after its}} {{introduction}} in 1910, intravenous arsphenamine treatment for syphilis {{was found to}} be complicated by jaundice. The underlying cause, <b>unsterile</b> <b>syringes</b> and needles, was eventually recognised in the early 1940 s, mainly through the efforts of British Army investigators. The infection most often transmitted was probably hepatitis B virus (HBV), but the high mortality in a few of the outbreaks of arsphenamine jaundice suggests that variants of HBV, or other hepatitis viruses, were sometimes involved. Fifty years later, {{at a time when there}} are estimated to be over three hundred million carriers of HBV in the world and probably at least as many hepatitis C virus carriers, and when the World Health Organisation estimates that there have been 17 million infections with human immunodeficiency virus, the lessons learnt around 1945 about the need to use sterile instruments and needles for all injections and venepunctures remain highly pertinent...|$|E
40|$|Research on the {{determinants}} of injection drug use behavior has traditionally concentrated on factors operating at the individual level. However, more recent {{studies have found that}} behaviors surrounding injection drug use are shaped, not only by individual-level characteristics, but also by the environment in which they occur. The risk environment paradigm, proposed by Rhodes and colleagues, describes how factors exogenous to the individual influence high-risk injection behavior and blood borne virus (BBV) transmission among people who inject drugs (PWID). To date, few elements of the risk environment have been evaluated as potential {{determinants of}} high-risk injection behavior. The purpose of this dissertation was to study the influence of two elements of the risk environment on unsafe injection practices among PWID – neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and social discomfort surrounding the acquisition of sterile syringes from syringe exchange programs (SEPs) and pharmacies. To this end, a systematic literature review was conducted on the relation between neighborhood context and injection drug use behavior. Research gaps and methodological challenges identified in this review were used to design analyses exploring relations among neighborhood disadvantage, social discomfort, and high-risk injection behavior. These analyses were conducted using data collected from 484 PWID enrolled in the Pharmacists as Resources Making Links to Community Services (PHARM-Link) study, combined with data from the American Community Survey. Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to estimate associations between measures of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and high-risk injection behavior. SEP accessibility and drug-related police activity were evaluated as potential modifiers of these relations. Similar methods were used to estimate associations between measures of social discomfort and high-risk injection behavior, including neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage as a potential effect modifier. The systematic literature review on neighborhood context and injection drug use behavior identified few articles pertaining to this relation (n= 22). Selected studies primarily investigated the influence of structural aspects of the neighborhood environment on behaviors surrounding injection drug use, while aspects of the social environment and potential modifiers of neighborhood-behavior relations were understudied. Subsequent quantitative analyses revealed that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with safer injection behaviors among PWID. Injectors in disadvantaged neighborhoods reported less receptive syringe sharing and less <b>unsterile</b> <b>syringe</b> use than their counterparts in relatively better off neighborhoods. Drug-related police activity attenuated associations between neighborhood disadvantage and <b>unsterile</b> <b>syringe</b> use, while the direction of associations between neighborhood disadvantage and the use of unsafe syringe sources varied with levels of SEP accessibility. In neighborhoods with high SEP accessibility, neighborhood disadvantage was associated with decreased use of unsafe syringe sources, while in neighborhoods with low SEP accessibility, neighborhood disadvantage was associated with increased use of unsafe syringe sources. Social discomfort was not associated with high-risk injection behavior, but effect modification was detected between neighborhood disadvantage and two items measuring the quality of relationships between participants and syringe staff: “Pharmacists care about my health and well-being” and “The staff at syringe exchange programs seems to care about my health and well-being. ” In disadvantaged neighborhoods, participants who reported positive relationships with syringe staff were less likely to engage in receptive syringe sharing. However, in relatively better off neighborhoods, positive relationships with syringe staff were associated with increased receptive syringe sharing. Overall, the results of this dissertation support the validity of the risk environment paradigm in shaping high-risk injection behavior among PWID. Future studies should continue to investigate contextual factors as determinants of behavior surrounding injection drug use. Understanding how aspects of local-area environments influence injection risk behavior will be essential to eliminating the transmission of BBVs among PWID...|$|R
40|$|<b>Unsterile</b> {{needles and}} <b>syringes</b> may {{transmit}} blood-borne infectious agents such as HIV and hepatitis B virus. The emergence of these diseases as major public health concerns {{and the risk}} of nosocomial transmission has heightened interest in the development of single-use injection devices. WHO and UNICEF embarked on a programme to develop and introduce these devices in 1987. We report on a field trial in Karachi, Pakistan, of the SoloShot (SS) plastic disposable syringe, which has a metal clip in the syringe barrel to prevent second-time withdrawal of the plunger. A conventional disposable syringe (CS) was used as a comparison. We observed 48 vaccinators giving 2400 injections with the SS and 1440 with the CS; 98. 7 % of SS performed as designed. The average volume required per delivered dose was comparable for the two syringes and was delivered more quickly with SS. Training and experience had a small but statistically significant effect on several aspects of SS use. Vaccinators who indicated a syringe preference preferred SS on 7 out of 9 indicators. SS is safe and effective in preventing reuse and is easier and quicker to use than the CS. Vaccinators require little, if any, special training. It could directly replace disposable syringes in expanded programmes on immunization (EPI) in countries where use of unsterile disposable devices occurs or when sterilization is not practical...|$|R
40|$|SummaryUnsafe {{injection}} practices, {{including the}} re-use of <b>unsterile</b> needles and <b>syringes,</b> are commonplace in developing country health settings, and contribute substantially {{to the global}} burden of blood-borne viral disease. Unsafe injection practices place at risk not only patients, but also healthcare workers, who practice universal precautions inconsistently and are commonly exposed to blood {{in the course of}} their work. Global awareness of the link between unsafe injection practices and the burden of blood-borne viral disease was slow to emerge but has grown in the recent years. In 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the Safe Injection Global Network (SIGN), which advocates a range of interventions for the promotion of injection safety. As well as exhorting healthcare workers to use a new needle and syringe for every injection, they should also be encouraged and supported to protect themselves from exposure to blood. It is argued here that promoting the occupational safety of healthcare workers in developing countries is an essential and currently under-valued component of the response to the problem of unsafe injection practices. Protecting healthcare workers from occupational infection with blood-borne viruses has a range of potential benefits, including safer injection practices for patients and less discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS. There is an urgent need for organisational commitment to the occupational safety of healthcare workers in developing countries, along with the provision of training in injection safety and universal precautions, adequate supplies of personal protective equipment, and hepatitis B vaccination...|$|R
40|$|Master thesis, Programme in Medicine. TITLE: Injecting {{drug use}} related {{bacterial}} infections requiring hospital care in Gothenburg 2008 - 2011. AUTHOR: Olle Andersson. Background 14 million people world-wide {{is estimated to}} be active injecting drug users. In Gothenburg, this number is at least 922. Injecting drug users (IDUs) have higher incidence of infectious endocarditis (IE) (particulary right-sided) and skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) compared to the general population. Many of the risk factors for acquiring these diseases are hygienic, such as the usage of <b>unsterile</b> needles and <b>syringes</b> and needle sharing. Aim To estimate the incidence and describe the clinical features of IDUs requiring hospital care in Gothenburg, Sweden for bacterial infections, and to document the injection habits of IDUs in Gothenburg. Materials and methods A retrospective study of the Swedish quality register for infectious diseases and hospital records from several departments at the Sahlgrenska university hospital. 171 hospital stays treated for IE and 3468 hospital stays treated for 15 different SSTIs between 2008 - 2011 were reviewed. When IDUs were found in these groups, additional data from their hospital stays were recorded and analysed for differences between groups. IDU patients at the department of infectious diseases in Gothenburg were interviewed between February and April of 2014 on their injection habits. Results IE incidence was 3. 45 for IDUs vs. 0. 08 / 1000 person-years for the general population and SSTI incidence requiring hospital care was 19. 25 for IDUs vs 1. 67 / 1000 person-years for the general population. IDUs were younger than controls and males dominated in the SSTI IDU group compared to the non-IDU group (p< 0. 05), but not in the IE groups. S. aureus was the most frequent cause of infection. Discussion / conclusions IDUss had high incidence of hospital care for bacterial infections, most commonly caused by S. aureus, and were dominated by men in their thirties. Contrary to previous studies, our IDU IE patients predominantly had a left-sided IE. None of the interviewees took hygienically precautions before injectional drug injections, all reused needles and all had been sharing needles...|$|R
