40|$|Fast {{simultaneous}} {{visualization of}} 3 D medical images and <b>medical</b> <b>instruments</b> {{is necessary for}} a surgical simulator. Because unconstrained motion of a <b>medical</b> <b>instrument</b> is more frequent {{than that of the}} patient, the visualization of <b>medical</b> <b>instruments</b> is performed in real time using surface rendering. However, volume rendering is usually used for realistic visualization of the 3 D medical image. We have developed an algorithm to combine a volume-rendered image and a surfacerendered image using a Z-buffer for depth cueing, which is applied to a surgical simulator. Surface rendering is used for visualization of a <b>medical</b> <b>instrument,</b> whereas 3 D medical images such as CT and MRI are usually visualized by volume rendering, because segmentation of the medical image is difficult. In this study, when the volume-rendered image is combined with the surface-rendered image, the amount of computation is reduced by early ray termination and instrument-region masking in the sheared image space. Using these methods, a fast combination of volume-rendered and surface-rendered images is performed with high image quality. The method is appropriate for real-time visualization of 3 D medical images and <b>medical</b> <b>instrument</b> motion in the images, and can be applied to image-guided therapy and surgical simulators.

40|$|International audienceThe {{problem of}} {{reconstruction}} of <b>ultrasound</b> <b>medical</b> images using blind deconvolution algorithm {{has been recognized}} as one of the most important aspect in ultrasound images. The image resolution is deteriorated by many parameters such as the diffusive effect in tissues, which produce the speckle noise.

This method suppose an iterative process for extracting the brightness small objects presents in the image using a dirty beam Point Spread Function.
