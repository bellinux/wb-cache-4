40|$|A {{case of a}} {{child with}} Sanfilippo B {{syndrome}} (MPS III B), born of a consanguineous marriage, is reported. <b>Urinary</b> <b>mucopolysaccharide</b> analysis showed an abnormal excretion mainly of heparan sulphate. N-acetyl-a-glucosaminidase activity was absent in the patient but was present in the heterozygous range in parents and siblings. CSF mucopolysaccharides were also abnormally high. In fibrocytes from conjunctival biopsy and CSF cells numerous vacuoles containing storage material were found. The presence of vacuoles in fibrocytes from conjunctival biopsy and/or in CSF cells can be useful in the diagnosis of many suspected lysosomal storage disorders...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Chikungunya (CHIK) fever is a {{viral disease}} {{transmitted}} to humans by {{the bite of}} Chikungunya virus (CHIK virus) infected Aedes mosquitoes. CHIK virus {{is a member of the}} Alphavirus genus of the family Togaviridae. Previous reports have indicated that infection with CHIK virus produces an acute arthritis in human hosts by large area of necrosis and collagenosis or fibrosis. Results We carried out the present study to determine the effect of chikungunya on the collagen and connective tissue metabolism in 75 chikungunya-affected people. First, we screened for mucopolysaccharides in urine by Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) test. Appearance of heavy precipitate indicates the presence of higher levels of mucopolysaccharides and later quantified by DMB dye method. The <b>urinary</b> <b>mucopolysaccharide</b> in CHIK patients was 342 ± 45 mg/l compared to healthy controls (45 ± 5. 6 mg/l). The collagen building blocks, proline and hydroxyproline were also measured in CHIK patients and observed higher excretion compared to healthy controls. Urinary excretions hydroxyproline was greater than the proline levels. Conclusion These results indicate that CHIK virus infection affects and damage the cartilage and connective metabolism and releases the degraded products from the tissue and responsible for increasing the levels of proline, hydroxyproline and mucopolysaccharides in CHIK affected patients. </p...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Sex linked spondyloepiphyseal {{dysplasia}} tarda is described in a family with four affected members. The characteristic features of short trunk, hip disease, and flattening of the vertebrae with a posterior "hump " were present. <b>Urinary</b> <b>mucopolysaccharides</b> were characterized both quantitatively and qualita-tively and were within normal values. Key words: Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia Tarda, Mucopolysaccharide Excretion. A variety of skeletal anomalies are classi-fied as {{spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia}} (SED), including the Morquio Syndrome (Type IV of the Mucopolysaccharidoses) (1, 2). How-ever, {{it is important for}} physicians {{to be aware of the}} different disease ntities within the general class of SED, for prognosis is variable and genetic ounseling quite differ-ent.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In the {{investigation}} of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), a genetic cause is found in approximately 10 - 20 %. Among these cases, the prevalence of the rare inherited metabolic disorders (IMD) is unknown and poorly evaluated. An IMD responsible for ASD is usually identified by the associated clinical phenotype such as dysmorphic features, ataxia, microcephaly, epilepsy, and severe intellectual disability (ID). In rare cases, however, ASD may be considered as nonsyndromic {{at the onset of}} a related IMD. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the utility of routine metabolic investigations in nonsyndromic ASD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the results of a metabolic workup (<b>urinary</b> <b>mucopolysaccharides,</b> <b>urinary</b> purines and pyrimidines, urinary creatine and guanidinoacetate, urinary organic acids, plasma and urinary amino acids) routinely performed in 274 nonsyndromic ASD children. RESULTS: The metabolic parameters were in the normal range for all but 2 patients: one with unspecific creatine urinary excretion and the other with persistent 3 -methylglutaconic aciduria. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the largest ever reported cohort of ASD patients for whom a systematic metabolic workup has been performed; they suggest that such a routine metabolic screening does not contribute to the causative diagnosis of nonsyndromic ASD. They also emphasize that the prevalence of screened IMD in nonsyndromic ASD is probably not higher than in the general population (< 0. 5 %). A careful clinical evaluation is probably more reasonable and of better medical practice than a costly systematic workup...|$|R
40|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{described}} for the determination of <b>urinary</b> acid <b>mucopolysaccharides</b> (1 - 4). It {{has been found that}} in normal individu-als the daily urinary excretion varies with age and sex (4, 5). A few {{attempts have been made to}} correlate urinary excretion of acid mucopolysac-charides with different disease states. Craddock and Kerby (6) have reported that patients with impairment of renal function have a urinary excre-tion of acid mucopolysaccharides lower than that of normal individuals. They also found no sig-nificant differences between normal individuals and diabetic patients without renal involvement. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis Badin, Schubert, and Vouras (7) have demonstrated a high plasma concentration of acid mucopolysaccharides, but there have hitherto been no data available con-cerning their urinary excretion. This paper presents data on the urinary excre-tion of acid mucopolysaccharides by patients with rheumatoid arthritis and discusses the identity of the <b>urinary</b> acid <b>mucopolysaccharides</b> excreted in this disease. MATERIAL AND METHOD The study was performed on eight patients hospital-ized for active rheumatoid arthritis. All of them showed a moderately elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, low-grade fever, involvement of several joints, and typi-cal radiographic alterations. All patients were untreated when the urine collection was started. Two of them, however (M. G. and P. C.), discontinued treatment a few days before the urine collection was started. Uri-nary acid mucopolysaccharides were determined accord-ing to the method described by Di Ferrante and Rich (4), by which the <b>urinary</b> acid <b>mucopolysaccharides</b> are precipitated, from an aliquot of the 24 -hour urine, with cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide. After removal of the precipitant the glucuronic acid content of the precipi-tate is determined. The results in Table I and in Figure 1 are expressed as mg. of glucuronic acid per 24 hours...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Sulfur-containingcompounds {{have been}} used in the search for whole-lxxlyradiation-protective compounds, in the design of amphetaminederivatives that retain appetite-suppressive effects but lack most behavioraleffects {{characteristic}} of amphetamines,and in the search for the cause of kidney stone formation in recurrently stoneformingpatients. METHODS: Organic syntheticprocedures were used to prepare radiation-protective compounds having a variety of sulfur-containingfunctionalgroups, and to prepare amphetamine derivativeshaving electron-attracting sulfur functions. In the case of the kidney stone causation research, isolationof <b>urinary</b> <b>mucopolysaccharides</b> (MPS) from recurrentlystoneformingpatients was carried out and the extent of sulfation of the MPS was determinedby electrophoresis. RESULTS: Whole-lxxlyradiation-protective agents {{with a high degree of}} protectionagainst lethaldoses of gamma-radiationin mice were found in a series of quinoliniumand pyrldinium bis(methylthio) and methylthioamino derivatives. Mechanism studies showed that the copper complexesof these agents mimicked the beneficialaction of superoxidedismutase. Electron-attracting sulfur-containing functionson amphetaminenitrogen,as well as 4 '-amino nitrogen providedamphetaminederivativeswith good appetite-suppressant effectsand few or no adverse behavioraleffects. Higher than normal levelsof sulfationof the urinary MPS of stone formers suggesteda cause for recurrentkidney stone formation. A sulfation inhibitorwas found to prevent recurrenceof stone formation and inhibitgrowth of existing stones. CONCLUSIONS: The inclusionof various sulfur-containing functions in organic moleculesyielded compounds having whole-lxxly radiationprotectionfrom lethaldoses of gamma-radiationin animals. The presence of electron-attracting sulfur functions in amphetaminegave derivatives that retainedappetite-suppressant effects and eliminatedmost adverse behavioraleffects.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{excretion}} of <b>urinary</b> acid <b>mucopolysaccharides</b> (AMPS) has been helpful {{to establish the}} diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidoses.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to define the type or types of dwarfism occurring in the Hereford breed of cattle in New Zealand as a basis to further work on the biochemical anomalies involved. The mating of 13 cows that had previously given birth to dwarf calves with a bull that had allegedly sired dwarf calves resulted in both dwarf and phenotypically normal calves in proportions compatible with an autosomal recessive type of inheritance. Dwarf foetuses produced from dwarf with dwarf matings were similar to a foetus of carrier with carrier mating. This observation helped confirm that the mode of inheritance was autosomal recessive. Selected morphological measurements of 45 dwarfs of various ages, and five dwarf foetuses were {{compared with those of}} phenotypically normal cattle from North America. It was concluded that the measurements were compatible with those expected from a single mutant and that the type of dwarf found in New Zealand was similar to {{the most common form of}} brachycephalic dwarf described in the Hereford breed in North America. This was in accord with expectations inasmuch as available evidence indicates that dwarfism was imported into New Zealand via four bulls who were from dwarf carrying familes. Histological examination of bone growth plates of 29 dwarf animals of various ages up to maturity and from five dwarf animals of various ages up to maturity and from five dwarf foetuses showed that columns of proliferating cells tended to be shorter and more irregular than those of normal animals and that there was a reduced number of hypertrophied cells. Electron microscopy showed normal appearing matrix and chondrocytes, except for more apparent dilations of endoplasmic reticulum in the latter. The histology of other tissues was normal. <b>Urinary</b> <b>mucopolysaccharides</b> of three dwarf animals and three matched controls were similar.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of lower {{urinary tract infection}} in 120 women with rheumatoid arthritis and secondary Sjögren's syndrome was evaluated retrospectively. Thirty one patients (26 %) had secondary Sjögren's syndrome. Recurrent urinary tract infection was significantly more common in these patients (11 / 31) than in patients without Sjögren's syndrome (4 / 89). Habitual leucocyturia was also more common in patients with secondary Sjögren's syndrome (18 / 31) than in patients with rheumatoid arthritis without Sjögren's syndrome (8 / 89).

40|$|Hurler's {{syndrome}} SUMMARY The {{occurrence of}} the Hurler syn-drome and acute myelogenous leukaemia in a 2 year-old girl is described. This represents the first published report of the concurrence of these two diseases. In this report we describe a patient with mucopoly-saccharidosis type I (Hurler's syndrome) (Bach et al., 1972; Stevenson et al., 1976), in whom acute myelogenous leukaemia developed. The {{occurrence of the}}se two rare diseases in the same person has not been previously documented. Case report A 6 -month-old white girl was referred to the Univer-sity of Minnesota Health Sciences Center in Septem-ber 1974 because of a heart murmur. Past medical history showed that the mother's pregnancy and delivery and the patient's newborn period were uncomplicated. At 1 month of age the child was treated for otitis media and at 3 months of age had an episode of severe diarrhoea which required admission to hospital. At 5 months, she developed persistent oral thrush and a urinary tract infection which was suc-cessfully treated with antibiotics. The patient's heart murmur {{was thought to be}} caused by a small ventri-cular septal defect which did not require immediate intervention. At the age of 11 months, the patient was admitted to the University of Minnesota Hospitals in acute renal failure caused by persistent diarrhoea and dehy-dration. Physical examination showed facial dys-morphia resembling that of the Hurler syndrome, an umbilical hernia, and hepatomegaly. Radiological examination disclosed the bony changes character-istic of dysostosis multiplex. Blood counts, including a leucocyte differential count, were normal. Exa-mination of blood smears showed cytoplasmic inclusions in approximately 20 % of the lymphocytes. These inclusions were usually coarse, sharply delineated, and surrounded by small clear haloes. They stained darkly with Wright's-Giemsa stain and were metachromatic when stained with toluidine blue. <b>Urinary</b> total acid <b>mucopolysaccharide</b> was 10. 6 mg/ 24 hr (normal: 0 - 6 mg/ 24 hr). Urinary excretion of dermatan sulphate was 6. 6 mg/ 24 hr (normal: 0 to 1. 0 mg/ 24 hr) and excretion of heparan sulphate was 1. 5 mg/ 24 hr (normal: 0 to 1. 5 mg/ 24 hr).
