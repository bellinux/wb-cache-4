25|$|A 25.9km {{extension}} of the Gottigere–Nagawara line via Kannur and Bagaluru up to the airport emerged as the most popular choice. In February 2017, the Centre requested the BMRC to start work on the airport link {{before the rest of}} Phase 3. The Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) forbid constructing an <b>underground</b> <b>road</b> or metro tunnel from the southern side of the airport due to security reasons. Such a construction would have to pass underneath the airport's second runway before entering the terminal buildings. This restriction eliminated three of the 9 proposed extensions to the airport. All three proposals were extensions of the Gottigere-Nagwara line to the airport.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} of building an <b>underground</b> <b>road</b> in Saint Petersburg arose in 1820. A {{resident of the}} city, a self-taught {{man by the name}} of Torgovanov, submitted a bold project to Emperor Alexander I - involving the digging of a tunnel from the center of the city to Vasilyevsky Island. The Russian ruler rejected the project and ordered the inventor to sign a pledge [...] "not to engage in hare-brained schemes in the future, but to exercise his efforts in matters appropriate to his estate".|$|E
2500|$|Many {{arguments}} were advanced against {{the construction of}} an <b>underground</b> <b>road.</b> The [...] "city fathers" [...] stated that the excavation works would [...] "violate the amenities and respectability of the city"; the landlords affirmed that underground traffic would undermine the foundations of the buildings; [...] the merchants feared that [...] "the open excavations would interfere with normal trade"; but the most violent adversaries of the novelty, the clergy, insisted that [...] "the underground passages running near church buildings would detract from their dignity". Thus all the projects for {{the construction of an}} underground passage in St. Petersburg, and later in Petrograd, remained on paper.|$|E
