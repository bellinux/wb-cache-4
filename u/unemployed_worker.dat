[...] Now the so-called [...] "united front from below" [...] would be set aside and real efforts made to engage in joint work with Socialist-led organizations, beginning with the convocation of a National Congress for Unemployment and Social Insurance by the CPUSA in January 1935. While this initial activity drew only limited participation from the Socialists early in the planning process and was boycotted by the fledgling American Workers Party headed by A. J. Muste, {{the stage was set}} for future joint work on the unemployment issue.|$|E

30|$|Bringing <b>unemployed</b> <b>workers</b> {{back into}} work via ALMPs will {{increase}} their employment probabilities by the transition effect. This effect is strongest for long-term <b>unemployed</b> <b>workers,</b> who during their unemployment suffer from skill attrition {{and loss of}} work routine 36. If, for example, subsidies enable these long-term <b>unemployed</b> <b>workers</b> to transition back into employment, workers gather work habits and routines, and their human capital appreciates 37. Once the subsidy expires, they are more valuable to the employer than originally, their retention rate is higher than their former hiring rate. Even if they are fired at this point, the former long-term <b>unemployed</b> <b>workers</b> are now short-term unemployed with an increased human capital and higher reemployment probabilities than long-term <b>unemployed</b> <b>workers</b> 38. As Heckman et al. (2002) point out, bringing workers into employment can have longer run impacts on workers’ human capital and employment path.|$|R

2500|$|He then {{conducted}} an eight-year {{study of the}} effects of unemployment in local New Haven, Connecticut, and published two works – The <b>Unemployed</b> <b>Worker</b> and Citizens Without Work – in 1940 from that study. [...] Bakke focused not just on the economic characteristics of unemployment but also on the social and psychological consequences and costs from it. [...] As such, Bakke became known for the sensitivity which he brought to this subject. [...] He emphasized the distaste the unemployed often had in applying for government relief, as illustrated by quotes like [...] "I'd rather be dead and buried" [...] and, when another was ultimately compelled to do so, [...] "I would hide my face in the ground and pound the earth." [...] The 2004 Encyclopedia of the Great Depression states that Bakke's New Haven study stands [...] "as a powerful statement of the importance of stable, adequately-paying work opportunities for individual well-being, as well as broader social well-being" [...] and that even given his other contributions to sociology, economics, and industrial relations, [...] "Bakke's study of Depression-era unemployment remains his most influential and far-reaching work." [...] Alice O'Connor, {{a professor of history at}} the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote in 2010 that, [...] "Seventy years later, the study's analysis still resonates".|$|E

5000|$|At the {{opposite}} end of the seesaw sat the city worker, who sought relief from the hunger, exposure, and disease that followed the wake of unemployment. Dependent on an impersonal industrial machine, he had sloughed off the frontier tradition of individualism for the more serviceable doctrine of cooperation through trade unionism. Unlike the depressed farmer, the <b>unemployed</b> <b>worker</b> often had no property or economic stake to protect. He was largely immune to taxation and had nothing to lose by backing proposals to dilute property rights or redistribute the wealth.

50|$|George J. Stigler {{proposed}} {{thinking of}} searching for bargains or jobs as an economically important problem. John J.

McCall's paper studied the problem of which job offers an <b>unemployed</b> <b>worker</b> should accept, and which reject, when the distribution of alternatives is known and constant, {{and the value of}} money is constant. Holding fixed job characteristics, he characterized the job search decision in terms of the reservation wage, that is, the lowest wage the worker is willing to accept. The worker's optimal strategy is simply to reject any wage offer lower than the reservation wage, and accept any wage offer higher than the reservation wage.|$|E
