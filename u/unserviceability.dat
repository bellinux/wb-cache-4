50|$|The Air Force is {{reported}} to be almost inactive due to the <b>unserviceability</b> of its aircraft. Dassault Mirage F1s of the French Air Force regularly patrol troubled regions of the country and also participate in direct confrontations. According to some sources, former President François Bozizé used the money he got from the mining concession in Bakouma to buy two old Mil Mi-8 helicopters from Ukraine and one Lockheed C-130 Hercules, built in the 1950s, from the USA. The air force otherwise operates several light aircraft, including a single helicopter.|$|E
50|$|Since {{its opening}} in 1937, Upwood had seen {{frequent}} periods where flying operations {{had to be}} curtailed or halted altogether due to the grass airfield being unserviceable. This <b>unserviceability</b> {{was caused by the}} levels of rain and general dampness of the area. When No 17 OTU was chosen for transition to Vickers Wellington bombers, it was decided to move the unit from Upwood as the field would never take the pounding from these heavier aircraft. When 17 OTU departed for RAF Silverstone in April 1943, Upwood was left with no aircraft. The RAF took this opportunity to begin construction of three concrete runways. These runways were completed by October.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the Tu-22, it became increasingly clear that the aircraft was considerably inadequate in its role as a bomber. In addition to widespread <b>unserviceability</b> and maintenance issues, the Tu-22’s handling characteristics proved to be dangerous. Its landing speed was some 100 km/h greater than previous bombers and it had a tendency to pitch up and strike its tail upon landing. It was difficult to fly, and had poor all-round visibility. In 1962, Tupolev commenced work on major update of the Tu-22. Initially, the bureau planned to add a variable-sweep wing and uprated engines into the updated design. The design was tested at TsAGI’s wind tunnels at Zhukovsky.|$|E

5000|$|Smith was a {{qualified}} helicopter pilot. He {{and his girlfriend}} (later his wife) Sarah Greene were injured on 10 September 1988 when the Robinson R22 Beta helicopter he was piloting (bearing the personal registration G-SMIF) crashed in Gloucestershire. Smith reported apparent unrecoverable loss of engine power whilst circling to reconnoitre an unfamiliar landing site. Both passengers survived, although Greene broke both legs and an arm, and Smith suffered a broken back and ankle. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch neither criticised nor exonerated Smith {{in relation to the}} crash (it being beyond its remit to do so), concluding simply that [...] "...examination of the helicopter flight control, fuel, engine control, dynamic systems and the engine itself revealed no failure or <b>unserviceability</b> that could have resulted in a loss of rotor speed." ...|$|E
50|$|The Tu-22 entered {{service in}} 1962, but it {{experienced}} considerable problems, resulting in widespread <b>unserviceability</b> and several crashes. Amongst its many faults was {{a tendency for}} skin aerodynamic heating at supersonic speed, distorting the control rods and causing poor handling. The landing speed was 100 km/h (62 mph) greater than previous bombers and the Tu-22 {{had a tendency to}} pitch up and strike its tail on landing, though this problem was eventually resolved with the addition of electronic stabilization aids. Even after some of its problems had been resolved, the Blinder was never easy to fly, and it was maintenance-intensive. Among its unpleasant characteristics was a wing design that allowed rudder reversal at high deflections. When the stick had been neutralized following such an event, the deformation of the wing did not necessarily disappear but could persist and result in an almost uncontrollable aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The Black Sea Fleet fared {{no better}} than the Baltic. The Bolshevik {{revolution}} entirely disrupted its personnel, with mass murders of officers; the ships were allowed to decay to <b>unserviceability.</b> At the end of April 1918, German troops entered Crimea and started to advance towards the Sevastopol naval base. The more effective ships were moved from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk where, after an ultimatum from Germany, they were scuttled by Vladimir Lenin's order. The ships remaining in Sevastopol were captured by the Germans and then, after November 1918, by the British. On 1 April 1919, when Red Army forces captured Crimea, the British squadron had to withdraw, but before leaving they damaged all the remaining battleships and sank thirteen new submarines. When the White Army captured Crimea in 1919, it rescued and reconditioned a few units. At {{the end of the civil}} war, Wrangel's fleet, a White fleet, moved to Bizerta in French Tunisia, where it was interned.|$|E

Quality control of new components is considered in this case study. The rst symptoms of <b>unserviceability</b> are disclose in the acoustic domain and then, in later exploitation, they develop into a form that is detectable during vibration measurements. The assessment is based on acoustical wave spectrum normalized with respect to rotational speed. An adequately prepared neural network of the Kohonen's type was used as assessing tool. Its performance was compared to results of the minimum distance method based on averaged spectrum patterns. Key words: machine state assessment, acoustic signals, neural networks. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the current state-of-knowledge in risk-based earthquake-resistant design of {{pipeline}} systems is presented. Damage to pipelines during past earthquakes is studied, {{and the necessity of}} evaluating the risk to such systems from earthquakes for their economic design is illustrated. The various aspects of seismic risk analysis of pipeline systems are briefly studied and a conclusion reached that given a tectonic and seismic data for the region in which pipelines lie, in addition to proper definition of various levels of pipeline <b>unserviceability,</b> it is possible to estimate the earthquake hazards to such pipelines with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Since this subject is of topical interest to this country, with increasing number of pipeline systems laid in earthquake-prone areas, specific areas are identified where more information is required before meaningful seismic risk analysis of pipelines can be done in India...|$|E
40|$|The safety {{assessment}} of structures by the maximization of a load factor up to a critical threshold is considered {{in this paper}} and a procedure is developed which generalizes limit analysis by the static approach. The following issues are dealt with: (a) piecewise linear approximation of material models is adopted as a unifying framework; (b) a procedure is developed apt to reduce the computing effort by means of yield mode selection or “sifting”; (c) a method which combines limit and deformation analysis is presented, based on mathematical optimization under linear and complementarity constraints and apt to compute, also {{in the presence of}} nonassociativity and softening, the safety factor with respect to either plastic collapse or local fracture or <b>unserviceability</b> because of excessive deformations, alternatively. Classical limit analysis rooted in associative perfect plasticity has well-known limitations, which are substantially mitigated in its generalization represented by method (c) proposed herein...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of constructing {{a device to}} give a measure of pilot reliability has been investigated. A rig to meet the proposals made by BLEU has been designed and basic circuits constructed and tested for accuracy of operation and reliability. An estimate of the materials required {{and the cost of}} construction has been made. The rig has been designed to be subject operated for twentyfour tests before requiring attention, and devices have been incorporated to indicate <b>unserviceability</b> and prevent operation if starting cond 4 tions are not correct. Switching sequences typical of the final period of an autoland approach are demanded verbally by magnetic tape replay equipment and the performance of the subject measured. The test consists of two phases; a preparatory or "unloaded" phase, and a "loaded" phase during which the subject performs a tracking task in addition to the switching sequence. The performance of the subject is recorded on veeder counters for both phases of the test in the form of actions demanded, actions taken and actions taken during a memory period. A measure of performance of the tracking task is also given by veeder counter...|$|E
40|$|Chloride {{attack from}} {{de-icing}} salt during winter may diffuse through the concrete cover and corrosion will initiate in concrete bridge when the chloride concentration exceed the threshold value. It {{may lead to}} loss of strength and <b>unserviceability</b> of the bridge. Structural health monitoring system (SHMS) is used to monitor the corrosion process of reinforcement and has been actively developed recently. However, the monitoring system is subjected to uncertainties associated with material, environmental load and structural effects. Hence the need for probabilistic analysis expressing life cycle performance in a reliability format. Modelling uncertainty {{is often associated with}} limited knowledge which can be reduced by increasing the availability of data. In this study, a method is developed to improve confidence in predicting corrosion concentration with taking into account time dependent reliability analysis. Bayesian updating method is used to update belief by taking into account the prior belief given the likelihood that such event is known. Monte Carlo simulation is used to calculate the probability of failure for annual increment over the life time of the structure based on multiple observations. It is found that by using Bayesian updating, uncertainty of the posterior model is reduced hence increased confidence in predicting future performance of the concrete bridg...|$|E
40|$|A {{correctly}} designed {{machine is}} characteristic of low vibration values. However wear processes occur during its operation. They are accompanied {{by a lack of}} balance of its rotating parts and elements, which results in non-coaxiality of shafts. For this reason energy and dynamic load resulting from machine vibrations grows. In this case cause and effect are mutually connected by feedback, that inevitably leads to occurrence of a failure. This paper presents results of investigations carried out on the basis of vibration analysis of propulsion systems installed on 207 P minesweepers. In view of specific features of their operation {{it is very important to}} ensure high level of reliability for them. For this reason was done an attempt to develop a method intended for identifying non-coaxiality of shaft line systems of engines propelling the ships. 16 characteristic features of recorded vibration signals were selected. As any of them has not satisfied criteria assigned to features which unambiguously determine state of reliability of shaft line systems, the investigations have been continued and as a result a novel method for non-coaxiality identification was proposed. The method consists in determining <b>unserviceability</b> clusters and assumes that characteristic features are of a concentrated character. This way a non-coaxiality of main engine shaft lines of 207 P minesweepers could be detected. This paper presents the proposed method and results of its application to the case in question...|$|E
