5|$|In January 1764 one barge {{experimentally}} carried one load of coal {{from the}} Thames at Oxford up the River Cherwell to Islip and thence <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> {{course of the}} River Ray to Arncott. The coal was landed at Arncott Bridge and delivered thence by wheelbarrows to Sir Edward Turner, 2nd Baronet at Ambrosden House. However, the experiment {{seems not to have}} been repeated and did not establish a regular freight trade on the river.|$|E
5|$|During the Second French Empire (1852–70) further {{changes were}} made, {{mainly to the}} interior. Hippolyte de La Rochefoucauld (1804–63), who had been {{minister}} plenipotentiary in Germany and Florence, brought a fine collection of furniture and 18th century Venetian glass chandeliers when he retired. He restored the great stone staircase. Influenced by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc he decided to transform the large East tower into a library. He blocked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> openings and pierced large new windows in the old walls.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{the route}} was realigned onto {{the south and}} west {{beltline}} to bypass Grand Rapids; the old routing through downtown became Business M-50 (Bus. M-50). In the late 1950s, when the US127 freeway bypass east of Jackson opened <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> routing through town became Bus. US127/M-50. At the same time, the concurrency with US23 between Dundee and the Ida area was dropped after the new US23 freeway opened; the old route becomes solely designated M-50.|$|E
50|$|There are seven, {{remaining}} homes {{from the}} 18th and early 19th century that make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> buildings on <b>the</b> street.|$|R

5|$|M-42 is an {{original}} state trunkline {{dating back to}} the 1919 signage of the highway system in Michigan. The original highway routing started at M-13 in Manton and ran due west to Mesick. From there the highway turned north and met M-11 at Chums Corners. M-11/M-42 ran concurrently northward into the City of Traverse City where M-42 ended. By May 1929, M-42 was extended east to connect to Lake City. The highway was further extended before 1936 <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Mission Peninsula north of Traverse City. In the latter half of 1940, the M-37 designation replaced M-42 north of Mesick through Traverse City to Old Mission. The last sections of highway were paved in late 1951 and early 1952.|$|E
5|$|At that intersection, the {{trunkline}} {{meets the}} northern end of M-22, which is running concurrently with M-72 along the parkway. As US31/M-37 turns east to run along the bay north of downtown, the highway merges with M-72 and picks up the LMCT again. Grandview Parkway runs between the Boardman River and the bay. Near the mouth of the river, US31/M-37/M-72 turns to follow Front Street along the remainder of the bay's shoreline. At Garfield Avenue, M-37 turns northward to run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Mission Peninsula, and US31/M-72 continues across the base of the peninsula to the East Arm of the Grand Traverse Bay. The highway runs north of the Cherry Capital Airport near the east arm as it angles southeasterly to Traverse City State Park. East of the park, the trunkline exits suburban Traverse City and rounds the bay to run northward along its eastern shore. In the community of Acme, M-72 turns eastward while US31 continues north past the Grand Traverse Resort.|$|E
5|$|M-72 starts its trans-peninsular journey at M-22 in the {{community}} of Empire on the shores of Lake Michigan in the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. From there it runs easterly uphill through mixed farmland and forest to cross the base of the Leelanau Peninsula. As the highway approaches the city of Traverse City, the roadway runs downhill and weaves {{back and forth across the}} Leelanau– Grand Traverse county line. M-72 merges with M-22 to run concurrently in the section of Traverse City in Leelanau County and immediately cross the county line into Grand Traverse County. The two highways run along Grandview Parkway, a four-lane boulevard on the shore of the West Arm of Grand Traverse Bay. At the intersection of Grandview Parkway and Division Street, M-22 ends. US31/M-37 run north along Division Street and turn east onto Grandview Parkway to join M-72. These three highways stay merged in a triple concurrency along the length of Grandview Parkway and across the Boardman River along the bay, bypassing downtown. They then follow Front Street until reaching Garfield Avenue east of downtown. At Garfield, M-37 turns north to run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Mission Peninsula which separates the west and east arms of Grand Traverse Bay. US31/M-72 continues east along the shores of the East Arm of Grand Traverse Bay and northward to a junction in Acme. M-72 turns east to cross rural eastern Grand Traverse County along rolling hills through the communities of Williamsburg and Barker Creek.|$|E

25|$|The initial idea, to {{construct}} a new tramway from Grand Lodge to Heaton Hall, was considered too expensive, as it would require remedial works to carry it across the railway tunnel. Therefore, a new scheme was proposed to open <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Manchester Corporation Tramways spur from Middleton Road to the old tram shelter some 300yards (270m) inside the park.|$|E
25|$|From Coniston a {{path and}} an unsurfaced road lead into the Coppermines Valley, {{the site of}} a number of disused mines; this is also the start of a popular path <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Man of Coniston. There are two {{possible}} routes to Wetherlam's summit from the Coppermines: either up the south ridge, called Lad Stones, or up the Red Dell valley {{to the west of the}} ridge.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme of}} the series is that First World {{countries}} are likely to survive the Change better than Third World countries. Stirling speculates that the developed world is a larger repository of handicraft lore than the undeveloped world, because the latter group heavily relies on First World castoffs and is too busy {{on a day-to-day basis}} to keep <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> ways, while people in the First World have the leisure to become expert horse riders or bow makers.|$|E
50|$|Senate Square and its {{surroundings}} make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> part of central Helsinki.

25|$|As late as 1820, a {{descendant}} of Vangaru Thirumalai, bearing the same name, was in Madurai endeavouring to obtain pecuniary assistance from the government. He and his family lived in Vellaikurichi, in the Sivaganga zamindari, and their children were there until quite recently. It is said that they still kept <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> tradition of holding recitations, {{on the first day}} of Chittrai in each year, of a long account of their pedigree and of a description of the boundaries of the great kingdom of which their forebears had been rulers.|$|E
25|$|Demolition {{of the old}} Waldorf–Astoria {{began on}} October 1, 1929. Stripping the building's {{materials}} was an arduous process, as the hotel was made of stiffer material than earlier buildings had, and the granite, precious metals, and wood chips used in the old hotel were not in high demand. Most of the wood eventually either went into a woodpile on nearby 30th Street or was burned in a swamp elsewhere. A {{lot of the other}} materials that made <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> hotel, including the granite and bronze, were dumped into the Atlantic Ocean off the shore of Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E
50|$|The {{prevailing}} {{cultures of}} this region are maritime-based, tribal, and predominantly non-sinicized (except for Singapore and the Philippines).

25|$|The {{highway that}} would later become part of CR106 {{originated}} in 1824. That is when the road was chartered as the New Turnpike, which stretched from what is now Southfields (formerly known as Monroe) to {{a fork in the}} road, which part later became NY210. When the park opened in 1910, CR106 was known as Southfields Road. In 1913, it became part of Seven Lakes Drive, with another designation coming three years later as County Highway 416. During the period of 1919 and 1920, the road was reconstructed, with a bridge being built three years later. A new route was assigned that year making <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Warwick Turnpike as NY17A.|$|E
25|$|The British Rallycross Circuit at Brands Hatch was {{designed}} and constructed by four-times British Rallycross Champion Trevor Hopkins. It is approx. 0.9 miles long and completed around 1981. Unlike earlier rallycross courses at Brands Hatch, cars start on the startline then veer right and downhill on the loose at Paddock Hill Bend. Through the left-right Esses at the bottom, the circuit rejoins the Indy Circuit to travel up and round Druids hairpin, before a 90-degree left through Langley's Gap and across the knife-edge, rejoining the Indy Circuit, but travelling anti-clockwise. From Cooper Straight, the cars swoop <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> link road and back to Paddock.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} years, Liutprand entered into {{an alliance with}} the Exarch against the pope, without giving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> one with the Pope against the Exarch; he crowned this classic double play with an offensive {{that led to the}} duchies of Spoleto and Benevento under his authority, eventually arriving to negotiate a peace between the pope and Exarch beneficial for the Lombards. No Lombard king had ever obtained similar results in wars with other powers in the Italian territory. In 732 his nephew Hildeprand, who succeeded him on the throne, briefly succeeded in taking possession of Ravenna, however he was driven away by the Venetians called shortly after the new pope, Gregory III.|$|E

25|$|On {{the right}} {{flank of the}} II Corps (Lieutenant-General Claud Jacob), the 11th (Northern) Division (Lieutenant-General C. L. Woollcombe) was to capture Hessian Trench {{on top of the}} ridge and Stuff Redoubt; if {{possible}} patrols were to be sent forward to take Stuff Trench. The 34th Brigade (Brigadier-General J. Hill) on the right would have to capture Mouquet Farm, advance <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> German second position trenches to Zollern Redoubt and thence to Stuff Redoubt. Two tanks were attached, to move from positions west of Pozières to arrive at Mouquet Farm at zero hour and then drive north onto the second position. On 28 September the Reserve Army issued instructions that Stuff and Schwaben redoubts were to be captured by 29 September and Stuff Trench on 1 October.|$|E
25|$|During the {{negotiations}} regarding the succession to the throne, she supported the Gustavian Party, who wished for the deposed King's son, the former Crown Prince Gustav, {{to be acknowledged}} as heir to the throne. During a dinner, General Baron Georg Adlersparre told her that Jean Baptiste Bernadotte had asked him whether her spouse (Charles XIII) had any issue, and was interested when he found that he had not. When she remarked that the throne had an heir in the deposed King's son, Adlersparre stated {{that none of the}} instigators of the coup would accept this, as they feared that the boy would avenge his father when he became King, and that to prevent this they would go as far as to take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> rumor that the deposed King was in fact the illegitimate son of Queen Sophia Magdalena and Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila.|$|E
25|$|The 3rd book {{takes up}} half of Froudacity. It begins with Froude alleging {{that there are}} few black intellectuals. Thomas {{responds}} by accusing the West Indian governments of suppressing blacks and noting that many black intellectuals sprang up in America shortly after Emancipation because they were integrated into society. Thomas uses the examples of Fredrick Douglass and Chief Justice William Conrad Reeves extensively in his arguments about race and intelligence. Both men are black and highly successful. Thomas uses these men as examples of successful black intellectuals, who succeeded despite racism. Thomas convincingly counters Froude's cheerful view of slavery. Thomas continues to contest Froude's multiple accusations about the results of black ruling over whites and what the ideal governance situation is for the West Indies. When Froude brings <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> stereotypes of blacks being lazy, or being cannibals or devil-worshipers, Thomas quickly counters all of the accusations. Thomas goes on to note the rising prominence of Christianity among blacks, and engages in a discussion on the limits of science and religion.|$|E
