60|$|He took a {{last look}} at the shaded green garden and left, {{whistling}} in an off key an <b>untuneful</b> air from a roofless farce comedy.|$|E
6000|$|Then came {{a strange}} sound, {{breaking}} on the quiet. It was twice repeated ere they recognised its nature. It {{was the sound}} of a big man clearing his throat; and just then a hoarse, <b>untuneful</b> voice broke into singing:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Thy tuwhits are lull'd I wot, [...] Thy tuwhoos of yesternight, [...] Which {{upon the}} dark afloat, [...] So took echo with delight, [...] So took echo with delight, [...] That her voice <b>untuneful</b> grown, [...] Wears all day a fainter tone.|$|E
60|$|The {{expected}} happened. The third {{ball was}} a slow long hop, and hit the road {{at about the same}} spot where the first had landed. A howl of <b>untuneful</b> applause rose from the watchers in the pavilion, and Mike, with the feeling that this sort of bowling was too good to be true, waited in position for number four.|$|E
60|$|I shall {{try to do}} the Whistle as suggested; but I {{can usually}} do {{whistles}} only by giving my whole mind to it: to produce even such limping verse demanding the whole forces of my <b>untuneful</b> soul. I have other two anyway: better or worse. I am now deep, deep, ocean deep in Otto: a letter is a curst distraction. About 100 pp. are near fit for publication; I am either making a spoon or spoiling the horn of a Caledonian bull, with that airy potentate. God help me, I bury a lot of labour in that principality; and if I am not greatly a gainer, I am a great loser and a great fool. However, sursum corda; faint heart never writ romance.|$|E

From the murky fissure, the eye saw, flung against the sky, the tangled filigree of his Moorish balconies. Through stone archways breaths of dead, vault-chilled air coughed upon him; his feet struck jingling iron rings in staples stone-buried for half a cycle. Along these paltry avenues had swaggered the arrogant Don, had caracoled and serenaded and blustered while the tomahawk and the pioneer's rifle were already uplifted to expel him from a continent. And Tansey, stumbling through this old-world dust, looked up, dark as it was, and saw Andalusian beauties glimmering on the balconies. Some of them were laughing {{and listening to the}} goblin music that still followed; others harked fearfully through the night, trying to catch the hoof beats of caballeros whose last echoes from those stones had died away a century ago. Those women were silent, but Tansey heard the jangle of horseless bridle-bits, the whirr of riderless rowels, and, now and then, a muttered malediction in a foreign tongue. But he was not frightened. Shadows, nor shadows of sounds could daunt him. Afraid? No. Afraid of Mother Peek? Afraid to face the girl of his heart? Afraid of tipsy Captain Peek? Nay! nor of these apparitions, nor of that spectral singing that always pursued him. Singing! He would show them! He lifted up a strong and <b>untuneful</b> voice: ...|$|E
