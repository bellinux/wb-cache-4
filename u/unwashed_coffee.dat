50|$|The {{landscape}} of Mana includes mountains, high forests and plain divided by valleys. Mountains include Weshi and Bebella. Rivers include Aniso, Doha, Wanja, Yebu and Sogibo. A {{survey of the}} land in this woreda shows that 89.1% is arable or cultivable (86.1% was under annual crops), 2.7% pasture, 2.8% forest, and the remaining 5.4% is considered swampy, degraded or otherwise unusable. Khat is an important cash crop. Coffee is another important cash crop for this woreda; over 5,000 hectares are planted with this crop. On 28 September, 2006, the Walta Information Center reported that farmers in this woreda sold 99,850 quintals of washed and <b>unwashed</b> <b>coffee</b> beans, earning 27.3 million Birr.|$|E
30|$|Coffee {{is one of}} the hot {{beverages}} consumed copiously {{every day}} throughout the world by millions of people. Even though the quality coffee is determined by the type of coffee variety, premium quality coffee comes from washed coffee of wet processing units than <b>unwashed</b> <b>coffee</b> from dry processing methods. However, coffee cherry pulping, fermentation and washing of parchment in the wet processing method discharges million tons of fresh coffee cherry pulp to the environment. But as a waste utilization strategy and value addition process, pulps discarded into the environment can be used to extract valuable ingredients for use as an additive in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The current study showed that total polyphenols, antioxidant capacity and free radical inhibition concentration varied among coffee pulps from different varieties and the type of solvent used for extraction. Waste pulp from Ababuna exhibited better total polyphenol content, antioxidant capacity and IC 50 value when 80  % methanol was used as an extraction solvent. Among solvent types, the same solvent showed better extraction efficiency for all pulps except Dessu. Therefore, extraction of such type of valuable bioactive compounds from coffee pulp discarded as a waste could add value to improve the economic value of coffee pulp waste. Furthermore, coffee cherry pulp can be used as an alternative source to extract polyphenols and antioxidant compounds for the benefit of human health.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} German import sof {{green coffee}} using both descriptive statistical and econometric tools. As determinants of import demand we consider not only prices and income {{but also the}} structure of the German market of roasted coffee and two institutional arrangements which had considerable influence on German coffee imports. One is the International Coffee Agreement and the other is the Lome Convention. West-German coffee imports which have grown steadily over the last three decades {{play an important role in}} world coffee demand. However, the demand structure differs from that of many other countries. In Germany high qualities have a much larger share of imports although the distribution of shares of export countries has changed, especially during the last ten years. A descriptive statistical analysis shows that this change has affected the shares of the four broad categories of coffee (Columbian Mild, Other Milds, Unwashed Arabica, Robusta), but also the distribution of shares within each category. Change of import shares within categories has mostly been confined to the two 'medium' qualities (Other Milds and Unwashed Arabicas) where ACP countries have increased their exports to Germany since enforcement of the Lome Convention in 1975. Most ACP countries in the two other categories (Columbian Milds and Robustas) have not experienced such a positive development. On the contrary, Indonesia which does not belong to this group has become one of the most important exporters of Robusta coffee to Germany during the last ten years. Quotas set by the International Coffee Agreement have favoured countries exporting <b>unwashed</b> <b>coffees</b> (with Brazil as the dominant exporter). This had especially severe effects for Germany which prefers washed coffees. Using annual data for the period 1966 to 1987 an hierarchical import allocation model is estimated where at the upper level demand for the four types of coffee is determined whereas at the lower level country-specific demand is explained. Beside the usual explanatory variables in econometric demand systems we also consider the effect of ACP membership and the influence of quota set by the International Coffee Agreement. Estimation results based on Deaton and Muellbauer's 'Almost Ideal Demand System' show that price and income reactions are quite different for the four qualities. We test the hypotheses of separability with respect to the four types of coffee and find this hypothesis to be acceptable. This allows us to estimate subsystems which determine country-specific demand for certain types of coffee. Contrary to theoretical considerations ACP membership has some influence on the countryspecific import demand structure...|$|R
50|$|Plantations {{are mainly}} {{located in the}} southeastern states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo and Paraná where the {{environment}} and climate provide ideal growing conditions. Minas Gerais alone accounts for {{about half of the}} country's production. Most plantations are harvested in the dry seasons of June through September, usually in one huge annual crop when most berries are ripe. In most countries, arabica beans are processed using the wet process (also called washed coffee), but virtually all coffee in Brazil is processed using the dry process (also called <b>unwashed</b> or natural <b>coffee).</b> The entire berries are cleaned and placed in the sun to dry for 8-10 days (or up to four weeks during unfavorable conditions). The outer layer of the dried berry is then removed in a hulling process before the beans are sorted, graded and packed in 60 kg bags.|$|R
