The analysis used U. S. military fighter/attack aircraft. First, relying on techniques developed in prior studies, {{measures of the}} technology embodied in aircraft {{and the cost of}} producing those aircraft were developed. Next, relationships between technology and cost were examined to create measures of "should costs", for each aircraft based on technology in the aircraft. These estimates of "should costs" were compared to actual costs to determine situations of cost overruns and <b>underruns.</b> Analyses of financial ratios of each aircraft's prime contractor were used to determine if financial condition could explain the cost overruns or <b>underruns</b> experienced during production, by using several forms of regression analysis. This yielded models relating financial ratios to cost overruns or <b>underruns.</b> Major findings indicate that financial condition does partially explain production cost overruns and <b>underruns,</b> but the relationship is small.

2500|$|The {{volume of}} water {{escaping}} {{from within and}} beneath the forearc results in some of Earth’s most dynamic and complex interactions between aqueous fluids and rocks. Most of this water is trapped in pores and fractures in the upper lithosphere and sediments of the subducting plate. [...] The average forearc is <b>underrun</b> by a solid volume of oceanic sediment that is [...] thick. [...] This sediment enters the trench with 50–60% porosity. These sediments are progressively squeezed as they are subducted, reducing void space and forcing fluids out along the decollement and up into the overlying forearc, {{which may or may}} not have an accretionary prism. Sediments accreted to the forearc are another source of fluids. Water is also bound in hydrous minerals, especially clays and opal. [...] Increasing pressure and temperature experienced by subducted materials converts the hydrous minerals to denser phases that contain progressively less structurally bound water. Water released by dehydration accompanying phase transitions is another source of fluids introduced to the base of the overriding plate. [...] These fluids may travel through the accretionary prism diffusely, via interconnected pore spaces in sediments, or may follow discrete channels along faults. [...] Sites of venting may take the form of mud volcanoes or seeps and are often associated with chemosynthetic communities. [...] Fluids escaping from the shallowest parts of a subduction zone may also escape along the plate boundary but have rarely been observed draining along the trench axis. All of these fluids are dominated by water but also contain dissolved ions and organic molecules, especially methane. [...] Methane is often sequestered in an ice-like form (methane clathrate, also called gas hydrate) in the forearc. These are a potential energy source and can rapidly break down. Destabilization of gas hydrates has contributed to global warming in the past and will likely do so in the future.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, buffer <b>underruns</b> became {{a very common}} problem as {{high-speed}} CD recorders {{began to appear in}} home and office computers, which—for a variety of reasons—often could not muster the I/O performance to keep the data stream to the recorder steadily fed.

40|$|Video {{streaming}} is in {{high demand}} by mobile users, as recent studies indicate. In cellular networks, however, the unreliable wireless channel leads to two major problems. Poor channel states degrade video quality and interrupt the playback when a user cannot sufficiently fill its local playout buffer: buffer <b>underruns</b> occur. In contrast to that, good channel conditions cause common greedy buffering schemes to pile up very long buffers. Such over-buffering wastes expensive wireless channel capacity. To keep buffering in balance, we employ a novel approach. Assuming that we can predict data rates, we plan the quality and download time of the video segments ahead. This anticipatory scheduling avoids buffer <b>underruns</b> by downloading {{a large number of}} segments before a channel outage occurs, without wasting wireless capacity by excessive buffering. We formalize this approach as an optimization problem and derive practical heuristics for segmented video streaming protocols (e. g., HLS or MPEG DASH). Simulation results and testbed measurements show that our solution essentially eliminates playback interruptions without significantly decreasing video quality...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{methodology}} {{similar to that}} used the in the worldwide research, the cost performance of Dutch large-scale transport infrastructure projects is determined. In the Netherlands, cost overruns are as common as cost <b>underruns</b> but because cost overruns are larger than cost <b>underruns</b> projects on average have a cost overrun of 16. 5 %. The focus on one country further enabled to consider cost overruns during different project development phases. It turned out that in the Netherlands the majority of the cost overrun occurs in the pre-construction phase (the period between the formal decision to build and the start of construction). The frequency as well as the magnitude of pre-construction cost overrun is significantly higher than in the construction phase. The used methodology of calculating cost overruns does however not take lock-in into account. This phenomenon shows that the real decision to build was taken much earlier in the decision-making process. Since estimated costs are usually lower during these earlier stages, the cost overruns based on this real decision to build are likely to be much higher. Cost overruns presented in studies are therefore often underestimated and the problem of cost overruns is much larger than we think...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} clinicallly manifesting footrot in sheep. The monitoring was conducted during April – December, 2010 in the area of Canton Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Clinical monitoring included 9 flocks, with a total of 1. 015 sheep of Pramenka breed, both males and females. Based on the severity of the foot lesions, we divide animals in three groups. The first group of sheep had lesions of the interdigital skin only. The second group of sheep had <b>underrunning</b> lesions in a small proportion of the feet. The third group of sheep were either walking on the knees or remained recumbent (<b>underrunning</b> lesions on most of the feet). During clinical observation, a total of 80 animals (7. 88 %) with clinically manifesting footrot were recorded. Within the first group 75 % of animals were diseased, in the second group 20 %, and in the third group 5 % of the total number of animals with clinically manifesting disease. Our results suggested that clinically manifesting footrot is widespread in Canton Sarajevo, and therefore it is necessary to undertake preventive and control measures against this contagious bacterial disease.
