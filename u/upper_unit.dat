25|$|The Cardenas Basalt is {{composed}} mainly of thin discontinuous beds of pahoehoe lava flows of olivine-rich basalt. The {{lower part of}} this formation consists of complexly interbedded, thin, and discontinuous beds of basalt, hyaloclastite, and sandstone that form low, talus-covered slopes. The <b>upper</b> <b>unit</b> of the Cardenas Basalt consists of cliff-forming basaltic and andesitic lava flows that are interbedded with beds of breccia, sandstone, and lapillite. No fossils {{have been found in}} the Cardenas Basalt. The Cardenas Basalt was formed by the subaerial eruption of basaltic and andesitic magma in wet coastal environments such as river deltas or tidal flats. Angular unconformities of vastly differing magnitudes separate the Cardenas Basalt from the overlying Nankoweap Formation and Tonto Group.|$|E

2500|$|The Tr-J {{boundary}} is {{not officially}} defined, but most workers recognise it in continental strata {{by the last}} appearance of index taxa such as Ovalipollis ovalis, Vallasporites ignatii and Patinasporites densus or, in marine sections, by the first appearance of the ammonite Psiloceras planorbis. In the Newark basin the palynological turnover event (hence the Tr-J boundary mass extinction) occurs below the oldest CAMP lava flows. The {{same can be said}} for the Fundy, Hartford and Deerfield Basins. In the investigated Moroccan CAMP sections (Central High Atlas Basin), sedimentary layers sampled immediately below the oldest basaltic lava flows, apparently contain Triassic taxa (e.g., P. densus), and were thus defined as Triassic in age as at least the lowest lava flows [...] Still, a different interpretation is suggested by : the sampled sedimentary strata are quite deformed and this can mean that some sedimentary units could be lacking (eroded or structurally omitted). With respect to the Triassic pollens found in some sedimentary units above the <b>Upper</b> <b>Unit</b> basalts, they could have been reworked, so they don’t represent a completely reliable constraint.|$|E

2500|$|To the {{northwest}} {{at the northern}} tip of Quebec near Hudson Strait, the Cape Smith Belt includes the 2,040to 1,970million-year-old Povungnituk volcano-sedimentary group and the 1,880million-year-old Chukotat Group. The [...] thick Chukotat Group is made of picritic and tholeiitic basalts. These basaltic lavas are intruded by narrow mafic and ultramafic sills. At least three different types of lava compositions exist in the Chukotat Group, including olivine phyric, pyroxene-phyric and plagioclase phyric. The <b>upper</b> <b>unit</b> of the Chukotat Group is 1,870million years old whereas the lower unit is associated with the Katiniq Suite sills, which cut through the underlying Povungnituk Group. In 1989, the Katiniq Suite sills were thought to be 1,918million years old, but more recent dating and a reinterpretation of the original age in 2004 suggests that the Katiniq Suite sills are closer to 1,880million years old. Therefore, the age range for the Chutotat Group is 1,880to 1,870million years. Volcanism of the Chukotat Group might have originated from rifting of a microcontinent that now forms the southwestern portion of Baffin Island.|$|E
2500|$|The oldest {{volcanic}} activity at Lascar occurred between 220,000 {{and less than}} 50,000 years ago. Activity has alternated between the eastern and {{western part of the}} volcano during its history.

The oldest mafic andesites are less than 43,000 years old, while the Chaile and Saltar pyroclastic flows erupted over 26,500 years ago. An alternative dating scheme considers Chaile to be 47,000 ± 16,000 years old and Saltar 167,000 ± 9,000 years old. The lavas from stage I are mostly exposed north and west of Lascar. The Chaile flows are actually formed by two separate units and are found on the southwest flanks of the volcano, up to a distance of [...] They reach thicknesses of [...] in the <b>upper</b> <b>unit</b> and [...] in the lower one.

After the end of stage I, a period of glacial erosion occurred prior to new activity, which created furrows in the Saltar flow. Imprecise argon–argon dating on younger andesites has yielded dates of 14,000 ± 18,000 and 17,000 ± 22,000 years.|$|E

In west-central Florida, north Florida, and along the updip margin of the system, the limestone crops out and the aquifer system is unconfined. Where low-permeability clays of the <b>upper</b> confining <b>unit</b> are present and substantial, the system is confined and groundwater is contained under pressure.
