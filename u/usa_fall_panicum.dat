The present study aimed to evaluate levels of nitrogen sidedressing on plant development and biochemical characteristics of two <b>fall</b> <b>panicum</b> cultivars.

40|$|A {{portable}} chlorophyll-content meter for proportional estimate determinations (SPAD- 502 indices) allows instant readings, and may {{be ideal}} to predict N requirements, since the method used in the laboratory is time-consuming and destructive. Consequently, this work’s objective was to evaluate the relationship between chlorophyll meter readings and total N contents in leaves of <b>fall</b> <b>panicum</b> plants, at the stage prior to flowering, as affected by topdressing N levels. The experiment was installed in asbestos cement boxes (50 L), under a plastic tunnel, at Faculdade de Ciências Agronômicas/ UNESP - Botucatu (SP), using a randomized block experimental design organized as a 2 × 6 factorial arrangement, in which treatments consisted of 2 <b>fall</b> <b>panicum</b> cultivars (AL Mogi and AL Tibagi) and 6 nitrogen fertilization levels (0, 40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 mg L- 1). The SPAD index values (chlorophyll) in leaves, as measured with the chlorophyll meter, and total N content variables were analyzed. The data were submitted to analysis of variance, means comparison, polynomial regression, and simple linear correlation analyses. The cultivars showed similar behavior for the evaluated variables, {{as a function of}} N topdressing fertilization. The application of 40 mg L- 1 N on <b>fall</b> <b>panicum</b> was sufficient to increase SPAD index and N content values. The SPAD and N content values in the leaves were positively correlated. This means that the chlorophyll meter can be used to indicate potential N deficiency in <b>fall</b> <b>panicum...</b>|$|R

Chufa (Cyperus esculentus) tubers {{were found to}} be a prominent item in the winter diet of cranes in New Mexico and Texas. In 1996 and 1997, chufa production was compared among mowing, discing, and sustained-flooding treatments intended to enhance chufa tuber growth. Sandhill crane numbers were monitored on wetlands during winter flooding to determine treatment preferences. No differences in sandhill crane use of treated wetlands were found in 1996, however in 1997, crane use was higher on disked field than sustained flood fields with mowed fields recording similar use levels as other treatments. Regression analysis also was used to explore the relationship between crane use and above and belowground food production. Chufa mass and <b>fall</b> <b>panicum</b> (Panicum dichotomiflorum) seed were positively related to crane use. We hypothesize cranes used wetlands where high biomass of these above and belowground food items was available to efficiently meet daily energetic needs. Disking wetlands at a depth of 5 cm about 30 days following initial wetland drawdown may be an effective treatment to expand chufa production and attract sandhill cranes...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{possible}} reasons {{for the expansion of}} the alien panicoid grasses Panicum schinzii (Transvaal millet), <b>Panicum</b> dichotomiflorum (<b>Fall</b> <b>panicum)</b> and Panicum capillare (Witchgrass) in maize fields in Belgium might be a lower sensitivity to post-emergence herbicides acting against panicoid grasses, in particular those inhibiting 4 -hydroxyphenyl pyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) and acetolactate synthase (ALS). Dose-response pot experiments were conducted in the greenhouse {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} five HPPD-inhibiting herbicides (sulcotrione, mesotrione, isoxaflutole, topramezone, tembotrione) and two ALS-inhibiting herbicides (nicosulfuron, foramsulfuron) for controlling naturalized Belgian populations of P. schinzii, P. dichotomiflorum and P. capillare. In another dose-response pot experiment, sensitivity of five local P. dichotomiflorum populations to HPPD-inhibitors and nicosulfuron was investigated. Finally, the influence of growth stage at time of herbicide application on efficacy of topramezone and nicosulfuron for Panicum control was evaluated. Large interspecific differences in sensitivity to HPPD-inhibiting herbicides were observed. Panicum schinzii was sensitive (i. e., required a three-fold lower dose than maximum authorized field dose to achieve 90 % reduction in biomass) to tembotrione but moderately sensitive (i. e. required maximum field dose) to topramezone and poorly sensitive (i. e. required three-fold higher dose than maximum field dose) to mesotrione and sulcotrione. However, P. dichotomiflorum, a species that morphologically closely resembles P. schinzii, was sensitive to mesotrione and topramezone but moderately sensitive to tembotrione. Panicum capillare was sensitive to sulcotrione and topramezone, moderately sensitive to tembotrione and poorly sensitive to mesotrione. All Panicum species were sensitive to low doses of nicosulfuron and foramsulfuron. Naturalized Panicum dichotomiflorum populations exhibited differential herbicide sensitivity profiles. All species tested showed a progressive decrease in sensitivity to topramezone and nicosulfuron with seedling age. A satisfactory post-emergence control of Panicum species in the field will require appropriate choice of herbicide and dose, as well as a more timely application (i. e. before weeds reach the four leaves stage) ...|$|R
