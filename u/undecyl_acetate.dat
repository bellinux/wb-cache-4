40|$|<b>Undecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> {{esterase}} from Pseudomonas cepacia {{grown on}} 2 -tridecanone was strongly inhibited by organophosphates and other esterase inhibitors. Also, p-chloromercuribenzoate at 1 × 10 − 4 M showed a 70 % inhibition of esterase activity. The enzyme hydrolyzed both aliphatic and aromatic acetate esters at substrate concentrations of 0. 25 M. Under these conditions the highest reaction rate was toward <b>undecyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> No lipase or proteolytic activity was demonstrated. <b>Undecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> esterase {{was classified as}} a carboxylesterase (B-esterase). Cell-free activity studies on the production of <b>undecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> esterase grown on different carbon sources plus zymogram studies demonstrated that the enzyme was inducible when 2 -tridecanone, 2 -tridecanol, <b>undecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and, to a lesser extent, 1 -undecanol were growth substrates. Induction of <b>undecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> esterase during oxidation of 2 -tridecanone supports the view that <b>undecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> is an intermediate in the degradation of the methyl ketone...|$|E
40|$|<b>Undecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> {{esterase}} {{has been}} purified from Pseudomonas cepacia grown on the methyl ketone, 2 -tridecanone. The Km for <b>undecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> was 2. 3 × 10 − 2 M. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that two esterase bands were being recovered during purification. These bands {{were separated by}} preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Molecular weights were estimated to be approximately 34, 500 by several methods. Molecular sieve polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the two esterases had the same molecular weight but different charge, which is indicative of isoenzymes...|$|E
40|$|A new {{intermediate}} {{was identified}} in the 2 -tridecanone pathway of Pseudomonas multivorans, formerly designated pseudomonad 4 G- 9. This intermediate, <b>undecyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> was isolated directly from growing cultures of the organism; {{the structure of the}} intermediate was determined by infrared spectroscopy and by gas-liquid chromatographic identification of its hydrolytic products. An amended pathway is presented that accounts for the conversion of 2 -tridecanone to provide carbon and energy for growth. It was shown that all early intermediates in the pathway arise biologically and sequentially from their precursors. Studies with P. aeruginosa showed that this organism also degrades 2 -tridecanone by the pathway characteristic of P. multivorans. Biochemical mechanisms of the pathway are discussed. Discovery of <b>undecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> confirms our earlier contention that the primary attack on methyl ketones by bacteria can be by subterminal oxidation...|$|E
30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{formation}} from alkanes and alkenes by microorganisms, ketones are occurring in plant oils, insects and mammals (Forney and Markovetz [1971]). Due to that ketones are common substances {{in the environment}} and therefore there are microorganisms that can convert those. Forney et al. showed the formation of undecane- 1 -ol and <b>undecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> from tridecane- 2 -one by Pseudomonas multivorans (Forney et al. [1967]). In the course of further degradation <b>undecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> was hydrolyzed to undecane- 1 -ol and acetate. Moreover, {{it was reported that}} the strain Gordonia spec. TY- 5 can convert propane to propan- 2 -ol and further to acetone (Kotani et al. [2007]). This bacterium formed methyl acetate from the latter with a BVMO, which was subsequently hydrolyzed to methanol and acetate. This kind of ketone metabolism can not only be found in prokaryotes. One example from the fungus kingdom is the conversion of progesterone to testosterone acetate by Cladosporium resinae and the subsequent ester hydrolysis to the steroid alcohol and acetate (Fonken et al. [1960]; Rahim and Sih [1966]). Another one is the formation of ε-caprolactone from cyclohexanone by the cycloalkanone monooxygenase from Cylindrocarpon radicicola (Leipold et al. [2012]).|$|E
3000|$|The first {{degradation}} pathway {{was identified}} for all investigated yeast strains with exception of C. albicans which is initiated by a BVMO with {{the formation of}} 4. The enzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidation can lead to both regioisomeric products of the corresponding ketone (Alphand et al. [1989]; Balke et al. [2012]; Kelly et al. [1995]; Leisch et al. [2011]; Rehdorf et al. [2010]; Song et al. [2013]). In this case the [...] "normal" [...] product is 4 and undecanoic acid methyl ester would be the [...] "abnormal" [...] one. It seems that C. maltosa as a whole cell catalyst rather formed the [...] "normal" [...] product 4 than the [...] "abnormal" [...] undecanoic acid methyl ester as nothing of the latter could be detected. The prefered formation of the [...] "normal" [...] product from a ketone by a BVMO has been described already (Mihovilovic and Kapitán [2004]). In addition, 5 was detected which was probably formed by conversion of 4 via a hydrolase. A similar reaction was reported by Forney et al. in which Pseudomonas multivorans converted tridecane- 2 -one to <b>undecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and subsequently hydrolysed it to undecane- 1 -ol and acetate (Forney and Markovetz [1968]; Forney et al. [1967]). Due to the slow growth of C. albicans with 1 the accumulation of products may not have been sufficient to detect them in the cultures of this yeast. That could be the reason why just 6 was found as a metabolite.|$|E
40|$|The {{turnip root fly}} (Delia floralis) {{lives in}} the {{northern}} hemisphere and is a major pest on Brassica crops. D. floralis can cause severe economical and production damage to Brassica crops if left uncontrolled. The main objective of this thesis was to test if pellets with cyanobacteria have a repellent effect on D. floralis and comparing its effect to another product with known effect, garlic granules (Ecospray Ltd, UK). If by chance the pellets themselves have an effect, they were added as a treatment. Field trials were performed in Ås, Norway to investigate whether cyanobacteria or garlic have a repellent effect on D. floralis. None of the treatments {{reduced the number of}} eggs D. floralis laid. Wind tunnel trials were performed at NIBIO, Ås, to see if the treatments had repellent effect in a more controlled environment. Adult females of D. floralis had 10 minutes in the wind tunnel, exposed to the same materials as in the field. No {{significant differences were found between}} treatments in the wind tunnel. GC-EAD trials were performed at NIBIO to see if the treatments induced any response on the antennae of D. floralis. Headspace was collected from; cyanobacteria, garlic, pellets with cyanobacteria and pellets without cyanobacteria. Samples were scanned with GCMS as to show which volatiles were present. For every trial, a new antenna was taken from D. floralis females > 7 days of age. There were no repeated antennal responses to volatiles from; pure cyanobacteria, pellets with cyanobacteria or pellets without. 3 different antennae showed responses to the same volatiles of garlic; Allyl disulfide, Allyl trisulfide, 3 -vinyl- 1, 2 -dithiacyclohex- 4 -ene and <b>Undecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (ISTD). The GCMS results from the samples show, that in the process of making pellets with cyanobacteria some volatiles disappear. We can conclude from all the results that pellets with cyanobacteria have no repellent effect on D. floralis females...|$|E
