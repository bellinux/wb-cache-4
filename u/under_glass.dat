5|$|The cloth {{on which}} the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and restretched, {{probably}} by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece. It was placed <b>under</b> <b>glass,</b> probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was <b>under</b> <b>glass</b> in 1858). The piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support. The row of rust-stained nail holes running {{along the top of}} the cloth is evidence that the frame was eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended. This low framing protected a portion of the canvas from deterioration and allows us to see some of the colours as they would have originally appeared.|$|E

25|$|The {{economy is}} chiefly agricultural. Cattle, sheep, pig rearing and some horse {{breeding}} {{are the main}} types of husbandry practiced. Poultry rearing, once popular, has very much declined. Wheat, barley, rapeseed, and oats are grown, as are potatoes. Sugar beet is no longer grown due to the withdrawal of EU subsidies. The numbers involved in farming have been declining {{for many years and}} many of the seasonal workers are now eastern Europeans. Mushrooms are also grown indoors. Tomatoes are grown <b>under</b> <b>glass,</b> for example at Campile.|$|E

Horse beans, left to mature fully, are usually harvested in the late autumn, and are then eaten as a pulse. The immature pods are also cooked and eaten, and the young leaves of the plant can also be eaten, either raw or cooked as a pot herb (like spinach).|$|E

25|$|Chrysoperla carnea adults eat pollen and {{honeydew}} {{and are not}} predatory, but {{the larvae}} have been recorded as feeding on seventy different prey species in five insect orders. The prey are mostly from the order Hemiptera and are predominantly aphids on low growing vegetation. On crops, the larvae have been reported as attacking several species of aphids, red spider mites, thrips, whitefly, the eggs of leafhoppers, leaf miners, psyllids, small moths and caterpillars, beetle larvae and the tobacco budworm. They {{are considered to be}} important predators of the long-tailed mealybug <b>under</b> <b>glass.</b> C. carnea occurs naturally in many growing regions of the northern hemisphere. It is considered an important aphid predator in cotton crops in Russia and Egypt, sugar beet in Germany and vineyards in Europe. It {{has been found to be}} effective at controlling the cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, in cotton crops in Pakistan. The presence of the larvae on the foliage was found to inhibit visitation and oviposition by B. tabaci which suggests the larvae may produce a volatile semiochemical which repels the whitefly.|$|E
25|$|On {{the south}} side of the altar, via the ambulatory, is a {{stairway}} climbing to Calvary (Golgotha), traditionally regarded as the site of Jesus' crucifixion and the most lavishly decorated part of the church. The main altar there belongs to the Greek Orthodox, which contains the Rock of Calvary (12th Station of the Cross). The rock can be seen <b>under</b> <b>glass</b> on both sides of the altar, and beneath the altar there is a hole said to be the place where the cross was raised. Due to the significance of this, it is the most visited site in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The Roman Catholics (Franciscans) have an altar to the side, the Chapel of the Nailing of the Cross (11th Station of the Cross). On the left of the altar, towards the Eastern Orthodox chapel, there is a statue of Mary, believed by some to be miraculous (the 13th Station of the Cross, where Jesus' body was removed from the cross and given to his family).|$|E

The species thrives in well-drained soils that are sandy or loam, with a pH that is acidic, alkaline, or neutral. They prefer low humidity, and grow well <b>under</b> <b>glass,</b> with full, filtered sun from the south, north, and east. Plants are typically watered once every couple of weeks, and kept nearly dry during the winter months. Propagation is facilitated by offsets of seeds sown in early spring in [...] weather. They require no pruning and make good patio and container plants. They are disease resistant, but are susceptible to pests such as mealybugss.|$|E

500|$|The {{album cover}} was photographed by Björk's former boyfriend, the French {{director}} Stéphane Sednaoui. It shows the singer {{standing in a}} London street, her pale skin and dark hair contrasting with the vivid colours of the Japanese-inspired signs behind her. An earlier shoot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino was scrapped; it would later appear in a 1995 article for The Face, in which Björk explained: [...] "It cost £24,000. But now I know what I want. OK, I admit it, [...] I'm a pop star"! In the original cover picture, Björk was surrounded by silver balls, but she scrapped the cover in favour of something [...] "more poppy". Designer Paul White of Me Company—who had been a frequent collaborator since The Sugarcubes—"surrounded her with giant postcards to represent communication with friends and family". Me Company designed the artwork, while Martin Gardiner modelled the lotus flower used in the album's booklet and packaging. The jacket Björk wears, shown on the cover, was inspired by Royal Mail airmail envelopes, referencing the album's title. It was specially crafted from envelope paper called Tyvek by designer Hussein Chalayan. Björk {{was a friend of}} Chalayan and an admirer of his designs, modelling for him in September 1995. The jacket is displayed <b>under</b> <b>glass</b> at Hard Rock Reykjavík, and was part of a 2015 MoMA retrospective on the singer, titled Björk.
