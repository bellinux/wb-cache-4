40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 -IntroductionToday, {{in developed}} countries the harmful consequences of modern urban development and urban sprawl phenomenon {{on the health of}} human beings is known. In this regard, attention on revitalizing urban neighborhoods and emphasizing their role in urban planning policies to enhance social capital and self-sufficient and walkable neighborhoods is important. In the majority of Traditional neighborhoods, you can see adherence of physical system to social system, possibility of face to face interaction, and proximity to market centers, relatively good access to public transport services, the low permeability of the access network for the riding, which are the capabilities of traditional neighborhoods toward achieving a healthy community. The current lack of attention to unique features of traditional neighborhoods has led to physical exhaustion, migration and decline in health indicators. Thus, continuing the current condition is not only a serious threat against the health of residents but also lead to the loss of opportunities for achieving sustainable development. 2 - Theoretical basesResearches of the World Health Organization indicate that in addition to age, sex and genetic variables that have a definite impact on health, personal factors, lifestyle, social effects and the local environment, workplace and general economic, social, environmental and cultural status have a major impact. Scientific studies also show that physical and mental health of people in urban neighborhoods, as the dual physical and social concepts which are formed as a result of urban planning decisions, is strongly influenced by its characteristics such as housing conditions, environmental quality, function of land uses and transportation network and the way residents perceive the environment. Thus, urban planning with different areas of interventions can {{play an important role in}} improving health indicators in an urban neighborhood. 3 – DiscussionIn this article, in order to explore the health system and its indicators in <b>urban</b> neighborhoods, after <b>auditing</b> the conceptual model and identifying the structures affecting the health, which are derived from theoretical considerations around issue, components resulting from the conceptual model in the traditional neighborhood of Imamzade Yahya, which is one of the neighborhoods of the historic fabric of Tehran, are assessed. Given the importance of subjective indicators of environment in health and lack of health statistics and information at local scale in Iran, a questionnaire was designed to assess the health of Imamzade Yahya neighborhood’s residents. Results show the interconnected relation between physical- environmental and social indicators of health including quality of housing, neighborhood facilities and sense of belonging to neighborhood, safety perception of residents in the neighborhood of Imamzade Yahya. Another result of the study shows low level of resident’s mobility and physical activity despite mixed uses and the low permeability of the transportation network for riding, which can be caused by physical exhaustion, lack of local facilities and attractions for residents and safety and security of the neighborhood and lack of separate pedestrian and bicycle lanes and numerous barriers to walking out. Another finding suggests the desirability of social indicators of health in this area, despite the possibility of face to face contacts and physical system complementation of the social system which might be caused by the decrease in social cohesion and bonds within neighborhoods and migrant sending from neighborhood and lack of public realms in it to shape social relations. 4 – ConclusionFindings of this study indicate the importance of physical and social environment of neighborhoods on population health. According to the criteria listed for a healthy neighborhood and according to the case study, in terms of the health system, we cannot distinguish between new and traditional neighborhoods and several factors and indicators are effective in creating healthy neighborhoods. Although the traditional neighborhoods of Iran are in line with the health system, due to physical and social deterioration, they require special attention by the institutions of urban management, in order to achieve sustainable development which encourages urban sprawl. 5 – SuggestionsAccording to results, to improve health indicators in the traditional neighborhoods in particular Imamzade Yahya neighborhood, emphasizing environmental, social, economic and physical indicators of sustainable development including: social fairness in the network planning with the possibility of movement and mobility for people in different ages and groups, land use planning with the aim to supply the needs of different social classes and creating self-sufficient neighborhoods, preserve and enhance the local natural resources and social capital development in the renovation and improvement projects of deteriorated urban neighborhoods with prioritizing health of urban residents in all stages of design is proposed.

40|$|Analysing urban regions is {{essential}} for their correct monitoring and planning. This is mainly accounted for the sharp increase {{of people living in}} urban areas, and consequently, the need to manage them. At the same time there has been a rise in the use of spatial and statistical datasets, such as the Urban Atlas, which offers high-resolution urban land use maps obtained from satellite imagery, and the <b>Urban</b> <b>Audit,</b> which provides statistics of European cities and their surroundings. In this study, we analyse the relations between urban fragmentation metrics derived from Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) data from the Urban Atlas dataset, and socio-economic data from the <b>Urban</b> <b>Audit</b> for the reference years 2006 and 2012. We conducted the analysis on a sample of sixty-eight Functional Urban Areas (FUAs). One-date and two-date based fragmentation indices were computed for each FUA, land use class and date. Correlation tests and principal component analysis were then applied to select the most representative indices. Finally, multiple regression models were tested to explore the prediction of socio-economic variables, using different combinations of land use metrics as explanatory variables, both at a given date and in a dynamic context. The outcomes show that demography, living conditions, labour, and transportation variables have a clear relation with the morphology of the FUAs.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, an {{increased}} {{attention has been paid}} to the effect of governance on regional development and trajectories. It is commonly argued by scholars and practitioners that governance is a key factor of regional competitiveness and differentiation. In this context, some institutions as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations (UN) or the European Commission (EC) claim that a better governance (or actually “good governance”) leads to better places to live, enhanced competitiveness and less segregation. In the same time, research, public efforts and investments has been focused on metropolitan regions as lever for economic development. If there is a consensus on the role of governance on metropolitan and urban development, researches mainly focused on cases analysis and bigger metropolis regions. Few empirical studies tried to link metropolitan governance and metropolitan trajectories in European Union, particularly for medium-size cities and metropolitan area (100. 000 - 1. 000. 000 inhabitants), which represents a significant proportion of the European population and economy. Nowadays, some exploratory researches based on the <b>Urban</b> <b>Audit</b> (European Commission) and complementary surveys give us additional information on governance of such cities. In our research, we aimed to explore the link between metropolitan governance of medium-sized cities and their trajectories. We used latest data from the European Commission (<b>Urban</b> <b>Audit,</b> Perception survey, Regional Statistic Database - Eurostat) and additional sources for socio-economic, environmental and governance indicators (especially metropolitan governance typology). We integrated in our work previous researches on this topic. Our exploratory research pointed out pattern and similarities in European medium-sized cities governance and trajectories.
