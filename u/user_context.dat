It automatically creates private copies of files that an application can use when it does not have permission to access the original files. This facilitates stronger file security and helps applications not written with the least user access principle in mind to run under stronger restrictions. Registry virtualization isolates write operations that have a global impact to a per-user location. Reads and writes in the HKLM\Software section of the Registry by user-mode applications while running as a standard user, as well as to folders such as [...] "Program Files", are [...] "redirected" [...] to the user's profile.

30|$|Although {{both kinds}} of {{semantic}} service selection are not keyword-based comparison, only profiles of services and requirements are taken into account. It is believed that <b>user</b> <b>contexts</b> will benefit the selection of target services. For example, {{in the case of}} a reminder service, the user location and available terminals in the current location are very useful in the process of determining a suitable terminal to represent the reminder services. Thus, in the service selection, <b>user</b> <b>contexts</b> should be employed. The CASSF utilizes the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) [20] and Description Logic (DL) [21] to compare TRs with device capabilities, overcomes the weakness of keyword-based matching and employs more contexts to facilitate the service selection.|$|R

The user's preferences are represented by a set of pre-defined profiles, which are exploited by the adaptation process in order to organize the delivered information into several levels of detail, based on a progressive access model. The proposed filtering exploits these models in order to filter and organize the available information, according to the selected that have been defined for a situation found in the <b>user's</b> current <b>context...</b>|$|R
