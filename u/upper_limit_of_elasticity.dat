40|$|The Marfan {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue, caused by mutations in the FBN 1 gene on chromosome 15. More than 500 mutations {{have been identified}} and almost all are unique to an affected individual or family. Genotype-phenotype correlations in the Marfan syndrome have been complicated by {{the large number of}} unique mutations reported, as well as by clinical heterogeneity among individuals with the same initiation. A relatively unknown cardiovascular manifestation of Marfan {{syndrome is}} dilatation of the main pulmonary artery. Of 50 patients with Marfan syndrome, MR imaging showed in 74 % patients an enlarged pulmonary artery root above the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> normal. Aortic <b>elasticity</b> determined by measurement of local distensibility and flow wave velocity with MR imaging is decreased in non-operated patients with Marfan syndrome. Aortic distensibility of the thoracic descending aorta appeared to be the strongest predictor for descending aortic complications. Over the past 30 years improvement of diagnostic modalities and aggressive medical and surgical therapy, have resulted in considerable improvement of life expectancy of patients with Marfan syndrome. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of modulating genes and genotype-phenotype correlations. Long-term follow-up studies may reveal the prognostic significance <b>of</b> aortic <b>elasticity</b> and may identify patients at risk of aortic complications.

As one enjoys {{the benefit of the}} public goods, the potential benefits of the project are not always maximized and may be partly wasted. By incorporating individual ability and project benefit into the original public goods game, we study the coupling effect of the four parameters, the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> individual contribution, the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> individual benefit, the needed project cost and the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> project benefit on the evolution of cooperation.

The coupling <b>of</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> individual contribution and the needed project cost determines the critical point <b>of</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> project benefit, where the equilibrium frequency of cooperators reaches its highest level.

40|$|Objectives. The {{goals of}} this study were to {{determine}} the probability of successful defibrillation at the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability and to evaluate a minimal safety margin for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator first shocks based solely on the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability. Background. The <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability is the strength at or above which ventricular fibrillation is not induced when a stimulus is delivered during the vulnerable phase of the cardiac cycle. It has been proposed as an estimate of defibrillation efficacy because it correlates with the defibrillation threshold and can be determined with a single episode of fibrillation. Methods. We studied 40 patients prospectively at implantation of transvenous cardioverter-defibrillators. Defibrillation threshold was defined as the weakest biphasic shock that defibrillated after 10 s of ventricular fibrillation. The <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability was defined as the weakest biphasic shock that did not induce ventricular fibrillation when given at 0, 20 and 40 ms before the peak of the T wave in ventricular paced rhythm at cycle length 500 ms. After determination <b>of</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability and defibrillation threshold, patients underwent six additional fibrillation—defibrillation episodes. The strength of five of the defibrillation shocks was equal to the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability; the strength of one of the six shocks was randomly selected to be equal to the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability plus 3 J. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was tested at the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability plus 3 J in 28 patients. Results. The defibrillation threshold was 8. 8 ± 5. 0 J (mean ± SD), and the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability was 11. 3 ± 4. 6 J; the defibrillation threshold and <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability were highly correlated (r = 0. 89, p < 0. 001). The success rate for the 200 defibrillation shocks with strength equal to the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability was 90 % (95 % confidence intervals based on proportion of successes in 40 patients: 86 % to 94 %). All five defibrillation test shocks at the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability were successful in 24 patients (60 %); four of five were successful in 12 patients (30 %); and three of five were successful in 4 patients (10 %). All 40 test shocks and 28 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks with a strength equal to the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability plus 3 J were successful. Conclusions. The <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability is a good estimator of the shock strength associated with 90 % probability of successful defibrillation (DFT 90). A strength of 3 J above the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability is a good estimate of the minimal acute safety margin for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator first shocks...|$|R

40|$|The least {{limiting}} {{water range}} (LLWR) was introduced as an integrated soil water content indicator, measuring {{the impact of}} mechanical impedance, oxygen and water availability on water uptake and crop growth. However, a rigorous definition <b>of</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> the LLWR using plant physiological and soil physical concepts was not given. We introduce in this study an <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> the LLWR, based on soil physical and plant physiological properties. We further evaluate the sensitivity of this boundary to different soil and crop variables, and compare the sensitivity <b>of</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> the LLWR to previous definitions of soil water content at field capacity. The current study confirms that the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> the LLWR can be predicted from knowledge of the soil moisture characteristic curve, plant root depth and oxygen consumption rate. The sensitivity analysis shows further that the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> the LLWR approaches the volumetric soil water content at saturation when the oxygen consumption rate by plants becomes less than 2 A mu mol m(- 3) s(- 1). When plants are susceptible to aeration (e. g. potato and avocado), {{there is a big}} difference between the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> the LLWR and the soil water content at field capacity, in particular for sandy soils. Results also show that the soil water content at aeration porosity corresponding to 10 % cannot be considered as an appropriate <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> LLWR because it does not appropriately reflect the crop water requirements. Similar poor results are obtained when considering the soil water content at matric potential - 0. 033 MPa or when defining the soil water content at field capacity based on drainage flux rate. It is observed that the <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> the LLWR is higher than either soil water content at - 0. 033 MPa matric potential or soil water content at field capacity as based on drainage flux rate, especially in sandy soils...|$|R
