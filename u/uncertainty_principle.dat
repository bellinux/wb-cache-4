5|$|A {{key element}} of quantum {{mechanics}} is Heisenberg's <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle,</b> which forbids the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of a particle along the same direction. Remarkably, the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> for charged, material particles requires the quantization of light into photons, and even the frequency dependence of the photon's energy and momentum.|$|E
5|$|In Copenhagen in 1927 Heisenberg {{developed}} his <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle,</b> which Bohr embraced. In a paper he {{presented at the}} Volta Conference at Como in September 1927, he demonstrated that the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> could be derived from classical arguments, without quantum terminology or matrices. Einstein preferred the determinism of classical physics over the probabilistic new quantum physics to which he himself had contributed. Philosophical issues that arose from the novel aspects of quantum mechanics became widely celebrated subjects of discussion. Einstein and Bohr had good-natured arguments over such issues throughout their lives.|$|E
5|$|Heisenberg's <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> {{predicts that}} during the inflationary phase there would be quantum thermal fluctuations, which would be {{magnified}} to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe. Inflation predicts that the primordial fluctuations are nearly scale invariant and Gaussian, which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.|$|E

5|$|With Jesse Beams {{from the}} University of Virginia, Lawrence {{continued}} {{to research the}} photoelectric effect. They showed that photoelectrons appeared within 2 x 10−9 seconds of the photons striking the photoelectric surface—close to the limit of measurement at the time. Reducing the emission time by switching the light source on and off rapidly made the spectrum of energy emitted broader, in conformance with Werner Heisenberg's <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{consequence}} of describing electrons as waveforms {{is that it}} is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and momentum of an electron. This became known as the Heisenberg <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> after the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg, who first described it and published it in 1927. This invalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The modern model of the atom describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus, but, depending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions around the nucleus than others; this pattern is referred to as its atomic orbital. The orbitals {{come in a variety of}} shapes-sphere, dumbbell, torus, etc.-with the nucleus in the middle.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Louis de Broglie {{proposed}} that all particles behave {{to an extent}} like waves. In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three-dimensional waveforms rather than point particles. A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles {{is that it is}} mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time; this became known as the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle,</b> formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1926. In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{phases of}} the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with a very high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10−37 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially during which time density fluctuations that occurred because of the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> were amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe. After inflation stopped, reheating occurred until the universe obtained the temperatures required {{for the production of}} a quark–gluon plasma as well as all other elementary particles. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle–antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point, an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30million. This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe.|$|E
25|$|The <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> is {{not readily}} {{apparent}} on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience. So {{it is helpful}} to demonstrate how it applies to more easily understood physical situations. Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle.</b> The wave mechanics picture of the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract matrix mechanics picture formulates {{it in a way that}} generalizes more easily.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> {{is such a}} basic {{result in}} quantum mechanics, typical {{experiments}} in quantum mechanics routinely observe aspects of it. Certain experiments, however, may deliberately test a particular form of the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> {{as part of their}} main research program. These include, for example, tests of number–phase uncertainty relations in superconducting or quantum optics systems. Applications dependent on the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> for their operation include extremely low-noise technology such as that required in gravitational wave interferometers.|$|E
