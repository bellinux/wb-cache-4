5|$|Given these {{properties}} of DNA damage and mutation, {{it can be}} seen that DNA damage is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where <b>unrepaired</b> damage will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, <b>unrepaired</b> DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.|$|E
5|$|DNA damage, due to {{environmental}} factors and normal metabolic processes inside the cell, occurs {{at a rate}} of 10,000 to 1,000,000 molecular lesions per cell per day. While this constitutes only 0.000165% of the human genome's approximately 6 billion bases (3 billion base pairs), <b>unrepaired</b> lesions in critical genes (such as tumor suppressor genes) can impede a cell's ability to carry out its function and appreciably increase the likelihood of tumor formation and contribute to tumour heterogeneity.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or <b>unrepaired</b> lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, a storm blew out the main two-story window {{at the front of}} the building, and the window's wooden frame was rotten, cracked and could not be saved. The window {{remained}} <b>unrepaired,</b> which left the sanctuary open to the elements for a month before the congregation, down to approximately 100 members, asked for assistance. The congregants had, by then, long held services in a smaller room, using the sanctuary only on the High Holidays. The New York Landmarks Conservancy's Endangered Buildings fund gave $2,500 for a temporary metal window, and assisted in getting approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for the work required to repair the damage, but the congregation did not have the $10,000 required to pay for it. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol received an additional $2,000 from the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites program in 1998 for a conditions survey. In 1999 a second application for National Historical designation was made, this time successful; the building was deemed significant at the local level, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30.|$|E
5|$|The venerable dreadnoughts of South America soldiered {{on for a}} {{short time}} after the war. The US Navy's All Hands {{magazine}} reported in a series of 1948 articles that all save São Paulo and Almirante Latorre were still in active service; the former had been decommissioned and the latter undergoing repairs. With the influx of the modern cruisers, frigates, and corvettes, the battleships were quickly sold for scrap. The Brazilian Navy was the first to dispose of its dreadnoughts, the oldest in the world by that time. São Paulo was sold for scrap in 1951 but sank in a storm north of the Azores while under tow. Minas Geraes followed two years later and was broken up in Genoa beginning in 1954. Of the Argentine dreadnoughts, Moreno was towed to Japan for scrapping in 1957, and Rivadavia was broken up in Italy beginning in 1959. Almirante Latorre, inactive and <b>unrepaired</b> after a 1951 explosion in its engine room, was decommissioned in October 1958 and followed Moreno to Japan in 1959.|$|E
5|$|With {{material}} from previous articles, Weisman uses {{the fate of}} the Mayan civilization to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence. To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the Panama Canal, where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams. To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from Chernobyl, Ukraine (abandoned in 1986) and Varosha, Cyprus (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does <b>unrepaired</b> damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing Istanbul, as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the underground cities in Cappadocia. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster. Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of volcanic tuff, and are likely to survive for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|The wing's {{operations}} expanded during February 1944. No. 23 Squadron entered combat on 11 February when six of its aircraft, {{operating in}} conjunction with six from No. 24 Squadron, bombed three villages south of Saidor in support of United States Army forces. The next day twelve aircraft from No. 23 Squadron and six from No. 24 Squadron made unsuccessful attacks against a road near Bogadjim after bad weather forced the cancellation of a close air support mission. For {{the remainder of the}} month, No. 78 Wing's main tasks were to attack the Japanese Army's 20th Division as it retreated from Allied forces and to strike Japanese airfields at Alexishafen and Madang. On 22 February, aircraft from all three of the wing's squadrons attacked camouflaged Japanese barge harbours near Madang; this was No. 21 Squadron's first combat operation. The next day ten Vengeances bombed Saidor. On 24 February, 23 Vengeances from Nos. 21 and 23 Squadrons struck Japanese anti-aircraft gun positions at Hansa Bay. Two aircraft from No. 23 Squadron were shot down with the loss of their crews. On 26, 27 and 28 February all three of the wing's squadrons attacked the airfields at Madang and Alexishafen to prevent Japanese forces from using them to attack the Allied forces which had landed on the Admiralty Islands. The first and second of these operations involved twelve aircraft from each squadron. A total of 33 Vengeances were dispatched for the operation on 28 February, when they and No. 78 Wing combined to form an attack force of 62 aircraft. Despite the size of these operations, No. 77 Wing's aircrew judged that the airfields were not being used by the Japanese as damage from earlier attacks went <b>unrepaired.</b>|$|E
25|$|During 1968, the pagoda {{was heavily}} damaged during the Tet Offensive of the Vietnam War, {{some of which}} remains <b>unrepaired.</b> In 1966, a bronze statue of Gautama Buddha was cast to replace the one {{destroyed}} during the pagoda attacks of Diem's regime.|$|E
25|$|About 30 {{percent of}} French {{aircraft}} were rendered unserviceable {{by the end}} of the war, some as a result of minor damage sustained in air raids that remained <b>unrepaired.</b> The Armée de l'Air admitted the loss of one Farman F221 and two Morane M.S.406s destroyed on the ground, but in reality its losses were greater.|$|E
25|$|By January 1981, {{none of the}} 2,637 A Division {{cars had}} ever had an overhaul. Infrastructure was not {{routinely}} inspected and few repairs were made until a failure occurred. Most rolling stock had gone unmaintained and <b>unrepaired</b> since 1975. The average Mean Distance Between Failures in 1981 was 6,639 miles, down from 13,900 in 1977 and 24,000 in 1970.|$|E

25|$|The DNA damage {{theory of}} aging proposes that aging is a {{consequence}} of <b>unrepaired</b> accumulation of naturally occurring DNA damages. Damage in this context is a DNA alteration that has an abnormal structure. Although both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage can contribute to aging, nuclear DNA is the main subject of this analysis. Nuclear DNA damage can contribute to aging either indirectly (by increasing apoptosis or cellular senescence) or directly (by increasing cell dysfunction).|$|E
25|$|Lorenzo instituted {{cost-cutting}} measures at Eastern by outsourcing some maintenance work, requiring {{pilots to}} fly longer hours, and delaying repairs. In one instance, a pilot refused to fly {{with only one}} functioning air-conditioning unit on a cross-country flight. The FAA investigated {{in the summer of}} 1987 and found that Eastern had the worst repair record of 11 airlines, and had an average of 55 items <b>unrepaired</b> per day, compared to an average of 29 in the industry. In October 1987, at a Congressional hearing, pilots told of being forced to fly unsafe planes.|$|E
25|$|UV {{radiation}} causes {{damage to}} the DNA of cells, typically thymine dimerization, which when <b>unrepaired</b> can create mutations in the cell's genes. When the cell divides, these mutations are propagated to new generations of cells. If the mutations occur in protooncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, the rate of mitosis in the mutation-bearing cells can become uncontrolled, leading {{to the formation of}} a tumor. Data from patients suggest that aberrant levels of activating transcription factor in the nucleus of melanoma cells are associated with increased metastatic activity of melanoma cells; studies from mice on skin cancer tend to confirm a role for activating transcription factor-2 in cancer progression.|$|E
25|$|On 10 January 1945, Harukaze was {{reassigned to}} the General Escort Command, but was further damaged {{in an air}} attack by United States Navy {{aircraft}} from Task Force 38 near Mako on 21 January and was subsequently towed to Sasebo Naval Arsenal. However, by this stage in the war, Japan {{no longer had the}} resources or equipment to effect repairs, and Harukaze remained docked at Sasebo <b>unrepaired</b> to the surrender of Japan. The ship was struck from the Navy List on 10 November 1945. Harukaze was subsequently towed to the north coast of Hyōgo Prefecture on the Sea of Japan and scuttled to form part of the breakwater at Takeno Port (presently part of Toyooka city.|$|E
25|$|During {{the worst}} years of Cabrini–Green's problems, {{vandalism}} increased substantially. Gang members and miscreants covered interior walls with graffiti and damaged doors, windows, and elevators. Rat and cockroach infestations were commonplace, rotting garbage stacked up in clogged trash chutes (it once piled {{up to the}} 15th floor), and basic utilities (water, electricity, etc.) often malfunctioned and were left <b>unrepaired.</b> On the exterior, boarded-up windows, burned-out areas of the façade, and pavement instead of green space—all {{in the name of}} economizing on maintenance—created an atmosphere of decay and government neglect. The balconies were fenced in to prevent residents from emptying garbage cans into the yard, and from falling or being thrown to their deaths. This created the appearance of a large prison tier, or of animal cages, which further enraged community leaders of the residents.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{tourists}} visiting Crimea in the 2014 season {{was lower than}} in the previous years due to a combination of Western sanctions, ethical objections by Ukrainians, and the difficulty of getting there for Russians. The Russian government attempted to stimulate the flow of tourists by subsidizing holidays in the peninsula for children and state workers from all Russia which worked mostly for state-owned hotels. In 2015 overall 3 million tourists visited Crimea according to official data, while before annexation it was around 5.5 million on average. The shortage is attributed mostly to stopped flow of tourists from Ukraine. Hotels and restaurants are also experiencing problems with finding enough seasonal workers, who were arriving from Ukraine mostly in the preceding years. Tourists visiting state-owned hotels are complaining mostly about low standard of rooms and facilities, some of them <b>unrepaired</b> from Soviet times.|$|E

500|$|Homologous {{recombination}} (HR) {{is essential}} to cell division in eukaryotes like plants, animals, fungi and protists. [...] In cells that divide through mitosis, homologous recombination repairs double-strand breaks in DNA caused by ionizing radiation or DNA-damaging chemicals. [...] Left <b>unrepaired,</b> these double-strand breaks can cause large-scale rearrangement of chromosomes in somatic cells, which can in turn lead to cancer.|$|E
500|$|The only {{large ship}} inside the [...] radius which {{sustained}} moderate, rather than serious, damage was the sturdily built Japanese battleship , ship #7, whose stern-on orientation to the bomb gave her some protection. Also, <b>unrepaired</b> damage from World War II may have complicated damage analysis. As the ship {{from which the}} Pearl Harbor attack had been commanded, Nagato was positioned near the aim point to guarantee her being sunk. The Able bomb missed its target, and the symbolic sinking came three weeks later, in the Baker shot.|$|E
500|$|Many cancers have {{epigenetic}} {{deficiencies in}} various DNA repair genes (see Frequencies of epimutations in DNA repair genes in cancers). [...] These repair deficiencies likely cause increased <b>unrepaired</b> DNA damages. The over-expression of BRCA2 seen in many cancers may reflect compensatory BRCA2 over-expression and increased homologous recombinational repair {{to at least}} partially deal with such excess DNA damages. [...] Egawa et al. suggest that increased expression of BRCA2 {{can be explained by}} the genomic instability frequently seen in cancers, which induces BRCA2 mRNA expression due to an increased need of BRCA2 for DNA repair.|$|E
500|$|In 1867, Goya's biographer Charles Emile Yriarte {{considered}} the painting {{important enough to}} warrant its own special exhibition, {{but it was not}} until 1872 that The Third of May was listed in the Prado's published catalog, under the title Scene of the Third of May 1808. Both the Third and Second of May suffered damage in a road accident while being transported by truck to Valencia for safety during the Spanish Civil War, apparently the only time they have left Madrid. [...] Significant paint losses to the left side of the Second of May have been deliberately left <b>unrepaired.</b> [...] Restoration work to both paintings was done in 2008 in time for an exhibition marking the bicentennial of the uprising.|$|E
500|$|The ship {{remained}} in very poor condition following her grounding on the Great Barrier Reef in June.

[...] An inspection of the hull revealed that some <b>unrepaired</b> planks were cut through to within ⅛inch (3mm). Cook noted it was a [...] "surprise to every one who saw her bottom how we had kept her above water" [...] for the previous three-month voyage across open seas.|$|E
500|$|She was towed to the Pacific via Philadelphia and the Panama Canal, departing on 3 March. The ship survived two {{atomic bomb}} blasts: Test Able, an air burst on 1 July 1946 and Test Baker, a {{submerged}} detonation on 25 July. Prinz Eugen was moored about [...] from {{the epicenter of}} both blasts and was only lightly damaged by them; the Able blast only bent her foremast and broke {{the top of her}} main mast. She suffered no significant structural damage from the explosions but was thoroughly contaminated with radioactive fallout. The irradiated ship was towed to the Kwajalein Atoll in the central Pacific, where a small leak went <b>unrepaired</b> due to the radiation danger. On 29 August 1946, the US Navy decommissioned Prinz Eugen.|$|E
500|$|The statue {{was damaged}} during the Second World War {{when a large}} German bomb hit Old Palace Yard on 26 September 1940, during the Blitz. The bomb {{exploded}} only a few metres away from the statue and reportedly lifted it bodily off the ground. The {{upper part of the}} sword was bent and the tail of the horse suffered several holes from pieces of shrapnel. Vincent Massey, the High Commissioner for Canada, argued that the sword should be left <b>unrepaired,</b> as it symbolised [...] "the strength of democracy which will bend but not break under attack." [...] The sword was replaced in 1947, and other repair work was also done. However, damage to the pedestal can still be seen. The statue received Grade II listed status in February 1970.|$|E
500|$|UB-1 and {{the still}} {{incomplete}} UB-15 {{were sold to}} the Austria-Hungary in February 1915; both were dismantled and shipped to Pola in May. After one cruise under the German flag, each boat was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The pair—renamed U-10 and U-11, respectively—were joined by U-15, U-16, and U-17 in October. Known as the U-10 or the Okarina (...) class {{as a part of}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the five boats operated primarily in the Adriatic in patrols off Italy and Albania. U-10 (ex UB-1) hit a mine in July 1918 and was beached, but had not been repaired by the end of the war. U-16 was sunk after she torpedoed an Italian destroyer in October 1916, and the remaining three (and the <b>unrepaired</b> U-10) were ceded to Italy at the end of the war.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, {{following}} {{his senior year}} at St. George's, Rolle attended the Nike All-America Camp and convinced his mother to let him attend a preparatory school in the United States, where he could showcase his abilities and hone his talents. They eventually settled on the Laurinburg Institute, a small school in North Carolina founded in 1904. Due to an <b>unrepaired</b> leak, the school's gymnasium was condemned in 1997, and the basketball team was forced to play home games as far as [...] away. In Rolle's only year at the institute, his team went 40–0 and won the national prep school championship. Under head coach Chris Chaney, Rolle recorded a per-game average of 10.1 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 4.5 blocked shots and had a field goal and free throw percentage of 64 percent and 76 percent, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{two years}} later, {{beginning}} on 17March 1986, Iowa underwent her overdue InSurv inspection {{under the supervision}} of Rear Admiral John D. Bulkeley. The ship failed the inspection. Among many other deficiencies, the ship was unable to achieve her top speed of [...] during a full-power engine run. Other problems discovered included hydraulic fluid leaks in all three main gun turrets, totaling [...] per turret per week, Cosmoline (anticorrosion lubricant) which had not been removed from all the guns, deteriorated bilge piping, frequent shorts in the electrical wiring, pump failures, <b>unrepaired</b> soft patches on high-pressure steam lines, and frozen valves in the ship's firefighting system. [...] Bulkeley personally recommended to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Admiral James Watkins, and the Secretary of the Navy, John Lehman, that Iowa be taken out of service immediately. Lehman, who had advocated bringing the Iowa-class ships out of mothballs, did not take the ship out of service, but instructed the leaders of the Atlantic Fleet to ensure that Iowas deficiencies were corrected.|$|E
500|$|Roberto Bartini had {{designed}} and built the Stal-7 airliner whilst he was the chief designer at the ZOK NII GVF (— [...] "Factory for Special Construction at the Scientific Test Institute for the Civil Air Fleet"). The performance of the Stal-7 was exceptional, particularly in respect to its payload; at gross overload weight over 56% of the total weight was payload. During flight trials with maximum all-up weight the prototype crashed on takeoff in early 1938, resulting in the arrest of Bartini and his imprisonment in a Siberian Gulag in February 1938. The Stal-7 lay <b>unrepaired</b> until Vladimir Yermolaev was appointed as chief designer at OKB-240 after Bartini's arrest, {{with the task of}} transforming the Stal-7 design into a long-range bomber, a task made easier since Bartini had reserved space for a bomb bay in the fuselage. After repair the Stal-7 carried on with the flight-test programme, including a record-breaking nonstop flight on 28 August 1939 when it flew Moscow—Sverdlovsk—Sevastopol—Moscow; a distance of [...] at an average speed of [...]|$|E
500|$|In June 1945, {{all of her}} {{secondary}} {{guns and}} about half of her anti-aircraft armament was moved ashore, together with her rangefinders and searchlights. Her crew was accordingly reduced to less than 1,000 officers and enlisted men. On 18 July 1945, the heavily camouflaged ship was attacked by fighter bombers and torpedo bombers from five American carriers as part of Admiral William Halsey, Jr.'s campaign to destroy the IJN's last surviving capital ships. Nagato was hit by two bombs, the first [...] bomb struck the bridge and killed Otsuka, the executive officer, and twelve sailors when it detonated upon hitting {{the roof of the}} conning tower. The second 500-pound bomb struck the deck aft of the mainmast and detonated when it hit No. 3 barbette. It failed to damage the barbette or the turret above it, but blew a hole nearly [...] in diameter in the deck above the officer's lounge, killing 21 men and damaging four Type 96 [...] guns on the deck above. A dud rocket of uncertain size hit the ship's fantail, but failed to do any significant damage. To convince the Americans that Nagato had been badly damaged by the attack, her damage was left <b>unrepaired</b> and some of her ballast tanks were pumped full of seawater to make her sit deeper in the water as if she had sunk to the harbor bottom.|$|E
500|$|During the 1920s, a {{commitment}} to refurbish Yavuz {{as the centerpiece of}} the new country's fleet was the only constant element of the various naval policies which were put forward. [...] The battlecruiser remained in İzmit until 1926, in a neglected state: only two of her boilers worked, she could not steer or steam, and she still had two <b>unrepaired</b> scars from the mine damage in 1918. Enough money was raised to allow the purchase of a new [...] floating dock from Germany, as Yavuz could not be towed anywhere without risk of her sinking in rough seas. The French company Atelier et Chantiers de St. Nazaire-Penhöet was contracted in December 1926 to oversee the subsequent refit, which was carried out by the Gölcük Naval Shipyard. Work proceeded over three years (1927–1930); it was delayed when several compartments of the dock collapsed while being pumped out. Yavuz was slightly damaged before she could be refloated and the dock had to be repaired before the repair work could begin. The Minister of Marine, Ihsan Bey (İhsan Eryavuz), was convicted of embezzlement in the resulting investigation. Other delays were caused by fraud charges which resulted in the abolition of the Ministry of Marine. The Turkish Military's Chief of Staff, Marshal Fevzi, opposed naval construction and slowed down all naval building programs following the fraud charges. Intensive work on the battlecruiser only began after the Greek Navy conducted a large-scale naval exercise off Turkey in September 1928 and the Turkish Government perceived a need to counter Greece's naval superiority. The Turks also ordered four destroyers and two submarines from Italian shipyards. The Greek Government proposed a 10-year [...] "holiday" [...] from naval building modeled on the Washington Treaty when it learned that Yavuz was to be brought back into service, though it reserved the right to build two new cruisers. The Turkish Government rejected this proposal, and claimed that the ship was intended to counter the growing strength of the Soviet Navy in the Black Sea.|$|E
