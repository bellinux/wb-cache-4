40|$|Background Every year several {{lives are}} lost to cancer. Some cancer {{patients}} develop skin {{changes that are}} caused by an underlying internal malignancy. This paper will be discussing both <b>unspecific</b> skin <b>symptoms</b> and specific paraneoplastic dermatoses that may arise in conjunction with cancer. Methods The paper is based on scientific papers found through non-systematic searches on PubMed and authoritative dermatological encyclopedias and textbooks. Results <b>Unspecific</b> skin <b>symptoms,</b> such as flushing, asteatosis and pruritus, may in some cases be caused by an underlying internal malignancy. After excluding the dermatoses and non-malignant systemic diseases that may cause these symptoms, one should consider {{the possibility of an}} underlying cancer. A thorough medical history and general examination should be performed in these cases. Because these symptoms are so common, it may prove challenging deciding which patients should receive further cancer screening. Paraneoplastic dermatoses are rear skin disorders caused by internal malignancies. The dermatoses may occur before, during or after the cancer diagnosis has been made. A few of the dermatoses are associated with specific types of cancer. The dermatosis and the cancer tend to run a parallel course. A rapid course, sudden appearance later in life, atypical clinical presentation, and a particular and characteristic morphology all suggest an underlying internal malignancy. Several hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of these paraneoplastic dermatoses have been suggested, but few conclusions have been reached. Conclusions <b>Unspecific</b> skin <b>symptoms</b> such as itch, dry skin and night sweats may be associated with internal malignancies. Specific paraneoplastic dermatoses are rear, but knowledge of these disorders may provide an opportunity for earlier diagnosis and treatment...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Insulin, C-peptide and {{proinsulin}} {{were measured}} in peripheral blood of 11 patients suffering from {{different types of}} hormone-producing pancreatic B-cell tumours. While proinsulin was elevated in 10 / 11 patients during prolonged fasting, C-peptide and insulin levels were found within the reference ränge in 5 / 11 and 3 / 5 cases respectively. A rapid insulin assay performed during surgery was helpful for localisation and identification of the respective tumours.

40|$|Sleep, {{depression}} and insomnia have manifold associations. Psychiatric sleep research in affective disorders {{has demonstrated that}} sleep in depression is characterized by an impairment of sleep continuity, deficits in slow wave sleep and a disinhibition of REM sleep (including shortened REM latency and increased REM density). Traditionally, insomnia, i. e. prolonged latency to fall asleep and increased frequency of nocturnal wake periods, was considered as an <b>unspecific</b> <b>symptom</b> of affective disorders. In the meantime, a shift in clinical and scientific focus has taken place viewing insomnia in addition as an independent diagnostic entity and as a clinical predictor of depression. Unfortunately, the neurobiological processes underlying the relationships between sleep, insomnia and depression have not been fully identified yet. It is clear that both insomnia and depression are characterized by alterations in the arousal system in the CNS presenting as hyperarousal. Moreover, insomniac patients display reduced and fragmented REM sleep periods, which might interfere negatively with basal processes of emotion regulation. The alterations in the arousal system and the interaction of it with the affect-regulatory system {{over the course of}} time might influence cognitive systems and hence lead to the clinical picture of depression. Given the suggestion of insomnia symptoms as possibly involved in the causation and the maintenance of psychopathology in general, this type of sequence might also be found in relation to other mental disorders...|$|R

30|$|Chronic non-bacterial {{osteomyelitis}} (CNO) is an autoinflammatory bone disorder. It {{primarily affects}} {{children and adolescents}} with a peak onset between 7 and 12  years. However, CNO can generally occur in all age groups. The clinical spectrum is variable and ranges from single asymptomatic bone lesions up to the most severe form of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) [1 – 7]. Due to this variable clinical presentation with sometimes rather mild and <b>unspecific</b> clinical <b>symptoms,</b> diagnosis is frequently delayed or even missed. This is particularly worrying, since untreated CNO may result in bone sclerosis, pathological fractures (mainly of the vertebral bodies) sometimes with subsequent neurological symptoms, growth anomalies, pain amplification, and psychosocial problems [8 – 11].|$|R

Metastasis of EOC occurs primarily through the transcoelomic route whereby exfoliated tumor cells disseminate within the abdominal cavity, particularly to the omentum. Primary and metastatic tumor growth requires a pool of proangiogenic factors in the microenvironment which propagate new vasculature in the growing cancer. Recent evidence suggests that proangiogenic factors other than the widely known, potent angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor may mediate growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer. In this review we examine the role of some of these alternative factors, specifically cathepsin D and cathepsin L...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA 51 -year-old man {{developed}} symptoms (palpitations) {{related to}} a large left atrial mass attached to interatrial septum discovered by trans-thoracic heart ultrasonography. Six months earlier this patient had undergone radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of an atrial flutter substrate. The left atrial mass was removed surgically using cardiopulmonary bypass with disappearance of symptoms. A post-operative diagnosis of atrial myxoma was made. The present case shows that a big left-atrial tumor could manifest with only mild <b>unspecific</b> <b>symptoms</b> such as palpitations. It {{is not clear whether}} the development of myxomas could be related to RFA or occurrence of heart tumors after RFA (already reported in medical literature) or whether it could be just chance without a causal link with ablation procedures. <Learning objective: It is essential to consider myxoma in the differential diagnosis of cardiac masses identified in patients after radiofrequency ablation since some cases of myxoma development after radiofrequency ablation have recently been described in the literature. Transthoracic echocardiography is a precise technique in the evaluation of cardiac masses, but a high index of clinical suspicion is necessary in order to define intracardiac pathologies that could be missed for <b>unspecific</b> <b>symptoms</b> of presentation. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of fatigue scales exist {{and there is no}} {{consensus}} on which fatigue measuring scales that are most appropriate for use in assessment of fatigue in different diseases. We aimed to describe the use of fatigue scales in studies of disease-related fatigue during the last three decades. We searched databases from 1975 to 2004 for original studies reporting on disease-related fatigue and extracted information on method used to assess fatigue, diseases under study and year of publication. A total of 2285 papers reported measures of fatigue in chronic non-acute diseases of which 80 % were published during the last decade. We identified 252 different ways to measure fatigue, of which 150 were use only once. Multi-symptom scales (n = 156) were used in 670 studies, while 71 scales specifically designed to measure fatigue were applied in 416 studies. The majority of these studies used scales with a multidimensional approach to fatigue, and most studies used scales that were disease-specific or only applied to few different diseases. Research in disease-related fatigue has increased exponentially during the last three decades, even if we adjust for the general increase in publishing activity. The number of scales has also increased and the majority of scales were developed for specific diseases. There is need for measure instruments with different sizes and dimensionality, and due to ceiling and floor effects, the same scale may not be useful for patients with different severity of fatigue. However, since fatigue is an <b>unspecific</b> <b>symptom</b> there should not be need for adopting disease specific fatigue scales for each individual disease. There may be differences in characteristics of fatigue between diseases and generic measurement instruments may facilitate documentation of such differences, which may be of clinical importance...|$|R
