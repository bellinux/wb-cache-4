5|$|Cooksey joined Oldham Athletic {{on trial}} in July 2003. At the age of 23, he stepped up three leagues into {{professional}} football permanently when Iain Dowie signed him on for financially troubled Oldham in August, {{who were in the}} Second Division. Bob Dowie, who was Cooksey's former manager at Chesham United, recommended the player to his brother, Iain. He followed in the footsteps of Fitz Hall and Wayne Andrews who also joined the club from Chesham as recommendations from Bob Dowie. Cooksey scored twice in Oldham's 3–0 home victory over Carlisle <b>United</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> FA Cup first round match on 8 November 2003. When the new season, 2003–04, started Cooksey was unable to make his debut due to suspension. He made 37 Second Division appearances for Oldham in the 2003–04 season, scoring four goals.|$|E
5|$|Déby faces armed {{opposition}} from {{groups who are}} deeply divided by leadership clashes but <b>united</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> intention to overthrow him. These forces stormed the capital on 13 April 2006, but were ultimately repelled. Chad's greatest foreign influence is France, which maintains 1,000 soldiers in the country. Déby relies on the French to help repel the rebels, and France gives the Chadian army logistical and intelligence support for fear of a complete collapse of regional stability. Nevertheless, Franco-Chadian relations were soured by the granting of oil drilling rights to the American Exxon company in 1999.|$|E

Although Shelley's father initially feared that his son was being corrupted by Hogg's ideas, he was reassured {{when he learned that}} Hogg was from a respectable family.|$|E

5|$|Venizelos and the King were <b>united</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{belief that}} the nation {{required}} a strong army {{to repair the damage}} of the humiliating defeat of 1897. Crown Prince Constantine was reinstated as Inspector-General of the Army, and later Commander-in-Chief. Under his and Venizelos's close supervision the military was retrained and equipped with French and British help, and new ships were ordered for the Hellenic Navy. Meanwhile, through diplomatic means, Venizelos had united the Christian countries of the Balkans in opposition to the ailing Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Although their league {{form was}} less {{impressive}} during the 1960s, {{the second half}} of the decade saw West Brom establish a reputation as a successful cup side. In 1966, under manager Jimmy Hagan, they beat West Ham <b>United</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> first League Cup appearance, winning 5–3 on aggregate in the last two-legged final. The following year they reached the final again, the first at Wembley, but lost 3–2 to Third Division Queens Park Rangers after being 2–0 up at half-time. Albion's cup form continued under Hagan's successor Alan Ashman. He guided the club to their last major trophy to date, the 1968 FA Cup, when they beat Everton in extra time thanks to a single goal from Jeff Astle. Albion reached the FA Cup semi-final and European Cup Winners Cup quarter-final in 1969, and were defeated 2–1 by Manchester City in the 1970 League Cup Final.|$|E

5|$|Increasing exports {{during the}} First World War {{led to a}} boom in {{industry}} and declining living standards in the industrial areas, particularly Catalonia and the Basque country. There was high inflation. The industrial sector resented its subjugation by the agrarian central government. Along with concerns about antiquated promotion systems and political corruption, the war in Morocco had caused divisions in the military. Regenerationism became popular, and the working class, industrial class, and the military were <b>united</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> hope of removing the corrupt central government. However, these hopes were defeated in 1917 and 1918 when the various political parties representing these groups were either appeased or suppressed by the central government, one by one. The industrialists eventually backed the government {{as a way to}} restore order. After the formation of the Communist International in 1919, there was a growing fear of communism within Spain and growing repression {{on the part of the}} government through military means. The PSOE split, with the more left-wing members founding the Communist Party in 1921. The Restoration government failed to cope with an increasing number of strikes amongst the industrial workers in the north and the agricultural workers in the south.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's first match {{after the}} final was against Arsenal, a match the club needed to win {{to stay in touch}} with the top four. Two goals from Robin van Persie, after Liverpool had scored in the first half meant that Liverpool lost 2–1 and were 10 points behind the team in 4th place, which would ensure {{qualification}} for the UEFA Champions League the following season. Liverpool's league form continued to falter {{after the final}}; they won four of their last thirteen matches and ended the season in eighth place. Despite their poor league form, Liverpool reached the final of the FA Cup against Chelsea. But they were unable to win a second trophy and lost 2–1. Cardiff played West Ham <b>United</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> first match after the final, which they lost 2–0. Despite the loss, they only needed to win one more in their remaining thirteen matches to finish in 6th place and qualify for the Championship playoffs. They faced third placed West Ham United, in the playoffs, which were contested over two-legs, with one at each team's home ground. Cardiff were unable to secure a second Wembley final, as West Ham United won 5–0 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|McAllister {{started his}} career with Eastleigh as a youth player. He moved to Basingstoke Town {{towards the end of}} 2001–02, making his debut in March 2002. McAllister spent three seasons there, making 113 appearances, scoring 66 goals before moving up the {{national}} league system to Conference National club Stevenage Borough where he made 10 appearances, having loan spells at Gravesend & Northfleet and Eastleigh in 2004–05. He joined Woking in 2005, spending two full seasons there, and making over 100 appearances. He had a short spell with Grays Athletic, being sent out on loan to Rushden & Diamonds and then another short spell at Oxford United, all during 2007–08. After leaving Oxford in 2008, he took a step up to the Football League {{for the first time in}} his career, signing for Exeter City. He went on to score seven goals in his first season, but was loaned out to Barnet and Rotherham United in his second and was eventually released by the club in May 2010. McAllister then dropped back down to non-League football, joining Crawley Town where he played at Old Trafford; his team was defeated 1–0 by Manchester <b>United</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> FA Cup fifth round tie. He rejected a new contract from Crawley at the end of the 2010–11, subsequently joining Newport County.|$|E

5|$|Now {{that he was}} a reservist, Matsui {{had more}} time to pursue his pan-Asian project. Between October and December 1935 he toured the major cities of China and Manchukuo {{speaking}} to Chinese politicians and businessmen about pan-Asianism and setting up a new branch of the Greater Asia Association in Tianjin. Upon his return to Japan in December 1935 he became President of the Greater Asia Association. In February and March 1936, amid ongoing tension with China, Matsui made a second trip to China, this time on a government-sponsored goodwill tour. Matsui met personally with Chiang, and though he found little common ground with him, they at least were <b>united</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> anti-communism. Matsui came out of the meeting believing that joint anti-communism could be the basis for Sino-Japanese cooperation in the future. Then in December 1936, following the Xi'an Incident, Chiang agreed to join with the Communist Party of China to resist Japan, a move that Matsui viewed as a personal betrayal.|$|E
5|$|Pressure high up {{the pitch}} from Barcelona kept Manchester <b>United</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own half, forcing them into {{attempting}} long balls downfield. A scrappy few moments {{in and around}} the centre circle followed, but Manchester United eventually came away with the ball. However, a lapse in communication between Giggs and Evra on the left wing allowed Eto'o to steal in and advance on the Manchester United goal. He cut in from the right wing and played a through-ball just out of reach of Messi, who went to ground after O'Shea had put his hand on Messi's shoulder. A period of sustained pressure from Barcelona followed, culminating with a run from Iniesta, who could only be stopped by a foul from Tevez {{on the edge of the}} Manchester United penalty area. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who curled the ball around the defensive wall and onto the post with Van der Sar beaten.|$|E
5|$|York's first {{match was}} away to last season's League Two {{play-off}} finalists, Wycombe Wanderers, which they lost 3–0. Anthony Stewart opened the scoring with a header before Aaron Holloway scored {{from a low}} shot, and Zubar scored an own goal when his attempted back-pass lobbed Flinders. York then played League One team Bradford City {{at home in the}} first round of the League Cup, and the visitors took the lead in the first half through a Christopher Routis volley. Luke Summerfield equalised with a penalty in the 49th minute, and after Bradford missed a penalty 20 minutes from time, Berrett scored a free kick in the 85th minute. James Hanson headed an equaliser for Bradford in stoppage time, and the match ended 2–2 after extra time. York won the penalty shoot-out 4–2, and Flinders saved two penalties before Carson scored the winning spot kick. York lost 2–1 to Hartlepool <b>United</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> first home league match of the season, despite taking the lead in the 57th minute when Thompson scored after Hartlepool failed to clear Summerfield's cross. Billy Paynter curled a shot into the top corner before Michael Woods scored the winner for Hartlepool in the 81st minute, after his miskicked shot took a touch off Berrett.|$|E

5|$|Although {{subject to}} all {{national}} laws and government, the Antakarana are also <b>united</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{recognition of the}} authority of a king (Ampanjaka) who is the living descendent {{of a line of}} Antankarana royalty going back nearly four centuries. The authority of this king is reaffirmed every five years at the village of Ambatoharaña in a ritual mast-raising ceremony called the tsangantsainy. Although some accounts date the ritual back to the origins of Antankarana kingship, the specific features of the ceremony as practiced today are rooted in historical events of the 19th century. The ceremony includes a pilgrimage to Nosy Mitsio to commemorate the flight of Antankarana refugees to the island in the 1830s to escape the advancing armies of the Kingdom of Imerina and to visit the tombs of ancestors who died there; until recently, it has sometimes also included raising both French and Antankarana banners to honor the 1841 treaty signed with the French. The king is selected by a council of elder {{members of the royal family}} in the ruling line. He is responsible for reciting joro (ancestral invocations) at ceremonies where the ancestors' blessings are requested. Another important social role is that of the Ndriambavibe. The Antankarana community selects a single noble woman to hold this position, which has similar authority and importance to that of the king. She is not his wife; rather, she has a separate leadership role to fulfill. The Antankarana are recognized among Malagasy as one of the few remaining ethnic groups in Madagascar that continues to reassert the ancestral authority of their king through continued practice of traditional kingship rituals.|$|E
