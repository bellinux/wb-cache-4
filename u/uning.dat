In 1927, he wrote a book called Ozbek klasik Muzikasi va <b>uning</b> Tarikhi (Uzbek classical music and its history), in which he presented shashmaqam as a grand musical tradition of the Uzbek people. In the 1930s, during the Soviet regime of Joseph Stalin, Uzbek shashmaqam was seen as an echo of the feudal ruling class and as a kind of music that promoted cultural progress toward adoption of European-style harmony. Finally, in 1951, a decree from the president of the Uzbekistan Union of Composers, reaffirmed by the committee of Uzbekistan, suppressed the maqam and the development of the musical practice.|$|E

Twenty-six <b>UNE</b> and 452 CTS patients also had diabetes. Results: Prevalence of diabetes in <b>UNE</b> was 6. 0 % and {{did not differ from}} that in CTS (6. 6 %); there were more male diabetic <b>UNE</b> patients (61. 5 %) than diabetic CTS patients (35. 8 %). There was no difference in occupation, duration of symptoms, association with CTS, polyneuropathy, and many neurographic findings of the ulnar, median, and radial nerves between diabetic and idiopathic or posttraumatic <b>UNE</b> patients when <b>UNE</b> groups were matched by sex and age, except for differences in sensory action potential amplitudes of diabetics vs. the other two groups. Conclusions: The prevalence of diabetes is the same in <b>UNE</b> and CTS patients. The patients with <b>UNE</b> and diabetes are clinically and electrophysiologically indistinguishable from other groups of <b>UNE</b> patients, except for a reduction in sensory action potential amplitudes in the diabetic <b>UNE</b> group, presumably owing to diabetic polyneuropathy.

The {{exploration}} of local entomophatogenic isolate fungus to restraint coffee fruit borer pest attack (Hypothenemus Hampei) {{and the study}} of coffee quality defects due to coffee borer pest attack, under the guidance of Muhammad Sayuthi as a chairman and Rita Hayati as a member. This research aims to obtain local mushroom to control H. Hampei pest and to see the quality of coffee due to H. Hampei pest. The research was conducted in the Laboratory of Pest and Plant Disease of Agriculture Faculty Unsyiah and in the community coffee plantation at <b>Uning</b> Village Sub District of Pegasing the Central Aceh District, since July 2014 until May 2015. The first stage of the research was conducted by exploring entomophatogenic mushroom from the coffee plantation farm in <b>Uning</b> Village Sub District of Pegasing the Central Aceh District. The experimental design used in in vitro testing was a complete randomized design using 5 repetition. Observed variables included mortality of coffee fruit borer pest (Hypothenemus Hampei), the quality defects due to coffee borer pest Hypothenemus Hampei. The second stage of the research was examining the effectiveness of entomophatogenic mushroom which found from the isolation result in the laboratory and has the potential as a biological control agent (Isolat T 2) of coffee fruit borer pest. The experimental design used was a randomized block design with 5 repetitions. The observed variables were coffee strains. The exploration obtained a fungal isolates that has the potential as a biological control agent (Isolat T 2) with an average percentage of mortality H. Hampei 92, 50 %. The test result of entomophatogenic mushroom spore density was found that entopmophatogenic mushroom (Isolat T 2) with 109 spore density were more effective in controlling coffee fruit pest, with the average percentage of mortality H. Hampei 65 %. Based on percentage analysis of caffeine content in coffee beans indicates that H. Hampei pest attacks could increase the level of caffeine in coffee beans. Based on percentage analysis of fat content in coffee beans indicates that H. Hampei pest attacks could decrease the level of fat in coffee beans. Based on percentage analysis of water content in coffee beans indicates that H. Hampei pest attacks could increased water level in coffee beans. Entophatogenic mushroom can reduce the coffee fruits borer pest attack from the first observation to the fourth observation, indicated by the amount of coffee fruits attacked by H. Hampei in each observation. Keywords: entomopathogenic fungus, coffee, Hypothenemus hampeiBanda Ace...|$|E

40|$|In Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander {{community}} health organisations play a signiﬁcant role as providers of essential {{primary health care}} (PHC) in rural, remote and urban settings. Australian governments have developed policies and funding programs to support this growing health sector. But the current arrangements for funding are much criticised. Providers complain about fragmented funding programs, with too many reports required. Government staff also experience problems with administering these funds, with high workloads in processing and managing a multitude of programs and grants, and some lack of compliance by providers, particularly with activity reporting requirements. This project aims to expand our understanding of these problems and ﬁnd better ways of funding and regulating PHC for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Speciﬁcally, this report seeks to answer these questions: • What are the major enablers and impediments to effective PHC delivery embedded in the current frameworks of funding and accountability for PHC services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australian States and Territories? • How could the effectiveness of funding and accountability arrangements be improved, drawing on insights from current Australian practice and international comparisons?

40|$|We analyze {{published}} ata on disparity detection thresholds for a {{wide range}} of conditions. This type of detection changes behavior dramatically at the spatial frequency of 2. 5 c/deg; above this frequency threshold remains constant while below it threshold grows at a uniform rate. Many other types of threshold, such as upper disparity limits for depth perception and threshold amplitudes for stereo and monocular motion, show similar behavior. These data lead to the postulate that there are no fovea 1 stereo channels peaking below 2. 5 c/deg, so that fovea 1 stimuli in the whole range below 2. 5 c/deg are processed by a single channel tuned to this frequency. Consequently, disparity detection thresholds at frequencies below this frequency are controlled by the single parameter of effective contrast in the 2. 5 c/deg channel, whose output depends jointly on the contrast and spatial frequency of the stimuli. We develop this idea to explain the relations between spatial and contrast <b>uning</b> functions for disparity thresholds. To validate our conclusions, we describe an experiment with difference-of-Gaussian stimuli over a range of interocular widths and contrast differences. For a dichoptic width ratio of 2 : 1, the dichoptic contrast ratio required to minimize disparity detection thresholds was 1 : 4, just as predicted by the model.
