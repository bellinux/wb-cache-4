40|$|Use of {{geographic}} information system (GIS) -based predictive mapping to locate areas of high potential for prehistoric archaeological sites is becoming increasingly popular among archaeologists.

40|$|Indoor {{localization}} using Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) fingerprinting {{has been}} extensively studied for decades. The positioning accuracy is highly dependent on {{the density of the}} signal database. In areas without calibration data, however, this algorithm breaks down. Building and updating a dense signal database is labor intensive, expensive, and even impossible in some areas. Researchers are continually searching for better algorithms to create and update dense databases more efficiently. In this paper, we propose a scalable indoor positioning algorithm that works both in surveyed and unsurveyed areas. We first propose Minimum Inverse Distance (MID) algorithm to build a virtual database with uniformly distributed virtual Reference Points (RP). The area covered by the virtual RPs can be larger than the surveyed area. A Local Gaussian Process (LGP) is then applied to estimate the virtual RPs’ RSSI values based on the crowdsourced training data. Finally, we improve the Bayesian algorithm to estimate the user’s location using the virtual database. All the parameters are optimized by simulations, and the new algorithm is tested on real-case scenarios. The results show that the new algorithm improves the accuracy by 25. 5 % in the surveyed area, with an average positioning error below 2. 2 m for 80 % of the cases. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can localize the users in the neighboring <b>unsurveyed</b> <b>area...</b>|$|E

5000|$|Generally, {{predictive}} modelling {{in archaeology}} is establishing statistically valid causal or covariable relationships between natural proxies such as soil types, elevation, slope, vegetation, proximity to water, geology, geomorphology, etc., {{and the presence}} of archaeological features. Through analysis of these quantifiable attributes from land that has undergone archaeological survey, sometimes the [...] "archaeological sensitivity" [...] of <b>unsurveyed</b> <b>areas</b> can be anticipated based on the natural proxies in those areas. Large land managers in the United States, such as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Department of Defense (DOD), and numerous highway and parks agencies, have successfully employed this strategy. By using predictive modelling in their cultural resource management plans, they are capable of making more informed decisions when planning for activities that have the potential to require ground disturbance and subsequently affect archaeological sites.|$|R

A number of problems remain to be solved to increase the accuracy of the gravity field determination.

In this paper, we present an analysis of echolocation and social calls of O. wroughtoni from the Barapede caves. Echolocation calls of free-flying O. wroughtoni were narrowband and shallow frequency-modulated (shallow-FM), with peak frequency ranging between 14 – 17 kHz. Social call sequences of roosting O. wroughtoni showed five distinct signatures. Multivariate analyses of echolocation calls of O. wroughtoni {{and the other three}} molossid species found in India (Tadarida teniotis, T. aegyptiaca, Chaerephon plicatus), showed strong support for acoustic differentiation of these species.

30|$|Best {{statistics}} {{observed for}} EMAG 2 v 3 for 0.5 ° grid spacing and for WDMAM at full resolution are notable, as both models are globally {{based on the}} same datasets and precompiled grids. A noteworthy difference is the use of more realistic synthetic magnetic anomalies generated from ocean spreading (Lesur et al. 2016) for WDMAM, in <b>unsurveyed</b> <b>areas.</b> This may partly explain the more favourable statistics for the 3 -arc-minute WDMAM model in the mid-Atlantic ridge and the Canary Islands to offshore west Portugal sub-areas. Whatever the resolution, differences between models and data on the Bay of Biscay and the western Mediterranean Sea sub-areas are relatively high (with standard deviations of about 35 – 50  nT). It is not disturbing considering the precision of the marine data (see Fig.  2). On the contrary, EMAG 2 v 3 and WDMAM inadequately characterize the magnetic signal at high resolution in the English Channel to North Sea continental shelf. The main differences in this area {{can be explained by the}} exclusive assimilation of the French longer-wave aeromagnetic data in the global anomaly models (Le Mouël 1970).|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{regional}} and seasonal distribution of seismic research surveys in the Southern Ocean {{is essential for}} assessing their acoustic impact on the marine environment. An analysis of the navigation data and cruise table in the Seismic Data Library System for Cooperative Research (SDLS) shows that a fairly extensive network of seismic lines is now available for the Southern Ocean. However, line spacing ranges from tens to hundreds of kilometres, and some almost <b>unsurveyed</b> <b>areas</b> still exist. The seasonal distribution of the seismic profile lengths shows periods with increased survey activity between 1976 / 77 and 2001 / 02, but only moderate levels of activity between 2002 / 03 and 2010 / 11. The corresponding line spacing is large, and lines are widely distributed over the Southern Ocean. None of the eight Antarctic regions considered here have experienced seismic survey activity during all summer seasons in the last 35 years. Instead, periods with survey activity are interspersed by periods with no survey activity. The average survey length ranges from ~ 2600 km/season off the Antarctic Peninsula to ~ 260 km/season off Enderby Land. Compared to the industrial seismic exploration off Norway the acoustic impact of the seismic research activity in the Southern Ocean is at least ~ 150 times lower...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2007 The {{importance}} of Alaskan embayments as adult walleye pollock and Pacific herring habitat is unknown. Seasonal hydroacoustic and trawl surveys {{were conducted in}} three oceanographically distinct bays to correlate abiotic and biotic habitat factors with nearshore fish distributions around Kodiak Island. Relationships between fish densities and sea surface temperature and salinity, bottom depth, zooplankton density and diversity, bottom temperature and salinity, and water column stratification were analyzed through General Additive Models (GAMs). Bathymetry and temperature were consistently included as important habitat variables. Relationships between fish density and habitat variables differed by season and location, suggesting factors defining preferred habitat vary seasonally. Herring appear to prefer warmer, fresher surface waters associated with the Alaska Coastal Current. Mean pollock density increased between February and August, indicating the nearshore area is important summer habitat, while it is less important for herring after winter spawning. Pollock and herring utilize different horizontal and vertical areas of the bays, with pollock in deeper waters. Pollock separated vertically by size class, but no vertical separation was found for herring of different size classes. The range of size classes and high densities of both species suggest these previously <b>unsurveyed</b> <b>areas</b> are important pelagic fish habitat...|$|R
40|$|Background: Past {{case reports}} have {{indicated}} that lymphatic filariasis (LF) occurs in Zambia, but knowledge about its geographical distribution and prevalence pattern, and the underlying potential environmental drivers, has been limited. As a background for planning and implementation of control, a country-wide mapping survey was undertaken between 2003 and 2011. Here the mapping activities are outlined, the findings across the numerous survey sites are presented, and the ecological requirements of the LF distribution are explored. Methodology/Principal findings: Approximately 10, 000 adult volunteers from 108 geo-referenced survey sites across Zambia were examined for circulating filarial antigens (CFA) with rapid format ICT cards, and a map indicating the distribution of CFA prevalences in Zambia was prepared. 78 % of survey sites had CFA positive cases, with prevalences ranging between 1 % and 54 %. Most positive survey sites had low prevalence, but six foci with more than 15 % prevalence were identified. The observed geographical variation in prevalence pattern was examined in more detail using a species distribution modeling approach to explore environmental requirements for parasite presence, and to predict potential suitable habitats over <b>unsurveyed</b> <b>areas.</b> Of note, areas associated with human modification of the landscape appeared {{to play an important}} role for the general presence of LF, whereas temperature (measured as averaged seasonal land surface temperature) seemed to be an important determinant of medium-high prevalence levels...|$|R
40|$|The bottom-dwelling larvae {{of aquatic}} insects are useful {{indicators}} of organochlorine (OC) contamination in aquatic habitats. However, {{these animals are}} often difficult to collect in numbers sufficient for contaminant analysis by gas chromatography. Winged, night-active adults retain accumulated contaminants, and can be collected in large numbers using light traps. Methodology was developed and evaluated for collection and analysis of adult caddisflies (Trichoptera) and mayflies (Ephemeroptera) for monitoring OC contaminant levels in freshwater habitats. Insects were collected using light traps from Great Lakes connecting channels and reference sites, and samples were analyzed for contaminants. Contaminant concentrations in samples of adult insects broadly corresponded to reported levels of chlorinated organic contaminants in sediments of the rivers and lakes of their origin. Spatial pattern of contaminants among insect samples collected {{along the length of}} rivers reflected the pattern documented for sediments in all Great Lakes connecting channels. Contaminant concentrations in insects varied with time in the Detroit and St. Clair rivers. Significant differences in contaminant concentration were found in animals of different species from the same location. Light-trapped adult aquatic insects are well suited for use in long-term biomonitoring programs, and for preliminary or synoptic studies of aquatic contamination in previously <b>unsurveyed</b> <b>areas.</b> (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Forest {{carnivores}} such as {{the fisher}} have frequently {{been the target of}} conservation concern due to their association with older forests and assumed sensitivity to landscape-level habitat alteration. Although the fisher has been extirpated from most of its former range in the western U. S., it is still found throughout much of northwestern California. However, fisher distribution is still poorly known in the majority of this region where surveys have not been conducted. In order to predict fisher distribution across the region, a multiple logistic regression model was created using data from 682 previously surveyed locations and a GIS vegetation coverage created from satellite imagery. A moving-average function was used to derive landscape level indices of vegetation variables from the GIS layer. Moving averages of canopy closure, tree size class, and percent conifer were found to have strong correlations with fisher presence. Regional gradients as represented by either precipitation or a trend surface derived from spatial coordinates were also significant predictors in the model. The model was validated with new data collected from 240 survey locations and proved to be accurate in predicting fisher presence in <b>unsurveyed</b> <b>areas.</b> The model was used to generate hypotheses as to the mechanisms controlling habitat selection and the scales at which these operate and to evaluate the representation of fisher habitat in existing protected areas. These insights may be valuable in designing conservation reserve networks that insure the long-term viability of forest carnivore populations...|$|R

40|$|Iceberg calving {{has been}} {{assumed to be}} the {{dominant}} cause of mass loss for the Antarctic ice sheet, with previous estimates of the calving flux exceeding 2, 000 [*]gigatonnes per year 1, 2. More recently, the importance of melting by the ocean has been demonstrated close to the grounding line and near the calving front 3, 4, 5. So far, however, no study has reliably quantified the calving flux and the basal mass balance (the balance between accretion and ablation at the ice-shelf base) {{for the whole of}} Antarctica. The distribution of fresh water in the Southern Ocean and its partitioning between the liquid and solid phases is therefore poorly constrained. Here we estimate the mass balance components for all ice shelves in Antarctica, using satellite measurements of calving flux and grounding-line flux, modelled ice-shelf snow accumulation rates 6 and a regional scaling that accounts for <b>unsurveyed</b> <b>areas.</b> We obtain a total calving flux of 1, 321 [*]±[*] 144 [*]gigatonnes per year and a total basal mass balance of − 1, 454 [*]±[*] 174 [*]gigatonnes per year. This means that about half of the ice-sheet surface mass gain is lost through oceanic erosion before reaching the ice front, and the calving flux is about 34 per cent less than previous estimates derived from iceberg tracking 1, 2, 7. In addition, the fraction of mass loss due to basal processes varies from about 10 to 90 per cent between ice shelves. We find a significant positive correlation between basal mass loss and surface elevation change for ice shelves experiencing surface lowering 8 and enhanced discharge 9. We suggest that basal mass loss is a valuable metric for predicting future ice-shelf vulnerability to oceanic forcing...|$|R

Two visits were {{paid to the}} port of Caldera for {{exchange}} of personnel and equipment. The cruises, together with the follow-up cruise SO 144 - 3, constitute the PAGANINI (PAnama basin and GAla pagos plume - New INvestigations of Intraplate magmatism) project. After transit to the working area, the first two legs (SO 144 1 a and b) were mainly dedicated to seismic data acquisition. During the entire cruise, hydroacoustic data were collected and magnetic measurements were made whenever possible. The data sets will extend the existing database, mainly collected on previous SONNE cruises (SO 76, SO 81, SO 107), but also by other ships. They provide an essential element for the morphotectonic development of the survey area and late tectonic reconstruction. Where possible, transit profiles were placed so that <b>unsurveyed</b> <b>areas</b> were covered. First results of the newly acquired hydroacoustics indicate profound differences in the morphology of the continental slope between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, which can partly be related to differences of the incoming plate, but partly also document the variability of the upper plate structure and composition. Having reached the survey area and after some investigations off Nicaragua had been performed, 14 ocean bottom stations from SCRIPPS Institute of Oceanology were installed northwest of Osa peninsula. They cover {{the region of the}} 20 August 1999 (Mw: 6. 7) earthquake and will be used for detailed studies of the processes in the seismogenic zone.

40|$|In 2008, {{a coordinated}} census of Jackdaw Corvus monedula {{was carried out}} to assess {{breeding}} population, distribution and nest site selection in Slovenia. Data collection continued for <b>unsurveyed</b> <b>areas</b> in the 2009 - 2011 period, including information on former colonies and threats. A total of 663 - 794 Jackdaw pairs were recorded at 86 sites, while total Slovene breeding population {{was estimated to be}} in the range of 700 - 900 pairs. Over one third of pairs were recorded in Central Slovenia, notably the largest city Ljubljana (20. 8 %), followed by almost a quarter in the Podravje region. Most colonies numbered between 2 and 5 pairs, the largest occupying the Bežigrad district of Ljubljana (82 - 87 pairs). Large-scale density in geographically more or less uniform areas ranged from 3. 65 pairs/ 10 km 2 in the Sava plain to 0. 15 pairs/ 10 km 2 in mostly mountainous area in northern Slovenia. The majority of Jackdaws selected buildings for nesting (82. 2 % of pairs), while nesting in trees occurred less frequently (14. 7 %) and was almost entirely confined to the two easternmost regions of Slovenia. Nesting in cliffs was recorded at just two sites in Slovene Istria (3. 1 %). Average colony size differed significantly in relation to nest site type, with colonies in rock walls being on average the largest (median = 9. 5 pairs), followed by colonies on buildings (6) and those in trees the smallest (3). Among pairs nesting on buildings, multi-storey residential buildings predominated (34. 2 %). A substantial percentage of population nested also on churches and tower blocks (14. 4 % and 13. 5 %, respectively). The highest percentage of pairs utilised holes in roofs (26. 9 %), followed by eaves (18. 0 %) and chimney pots (14. 7 %). Tree-nesting pairs occupied mostly small woods situated in open agricultural landscape. The most commonly used tree species was Beech Fagus sylvatica (53. 1 % of pairs) which hosted 14 of the total 16 forest colonies. For Jackdaws nesting in urban parks and avenues, plane trees Platanus sp. were the most important (30. 6 % of pairs). Their population stronghold was in lowlands, with 88. 1 % of pairs recorded at elevations under 400 m and the highest living colony in Slovenia at 578 m a. s. l. Jackdaws occurred on at least 54 specific sites in the past but became extinct there or declined severely by the time of this study. A minimum of 217 - 254 pairs were estimated lost at these sites, constituting a decline of 24 % in c. 10 - 20 years. According to the IUCN criteria, Jackdaw would qualify as Vulnerable (VU) on the Red List of Slovenia. The commonest known cause of extinction/decline is renovation of buildings, a threat that is projected to escalate in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Austral summer {{estimates}} of abundance are obtained for humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Southern Ocean from the IWC’s IDCR and SOWER circumpolar programmes. These surveys have encircled the Antarctic three times: 1978 / 79 – 1983 / 84 (CPI), 1985 / 86 – 1990 / 91 (CPII) and 1991 / 92 – 2003 / 04 (CPIII), criss-crossing strata totalling respectively 64. 3 %, 79. 5 % and 99. 7 % of the open-ocean area south of 60 °S. Humpback whales were {{absent from the}} Ross Sea, but were sighted in all other regions, and in particularly high densities around the Antarctic Peninsula, in Management Area IV and north of the Ross Sea. Abundance estimates are presented for each CP, for Management Areas, and for assumed summer feeding regions of each Breeding Stock. Abundance estimates are negatively biased because some whales on the trackline are missed and because some humpback whales are outside the survey region. Circumpolar estimates with approximate midpoints of 1980 / 81, 1987 / 88 and 1997 / 98 are 7, 100 (CV = 0. 36), 10, 200 (CV = 0. 30) and 41, 500 (CV = 0. 11). When these are adjusted simply for <b>unsurveyed</b> northern <b>areas,</b> the estimated annual rate of increase is 9. 6 % (95 % CI 5. 8 – 13. 4 %). All Breeding Stocks {{are estimated to be}} increasing but increase rates are significantly greater than zero only for those on the eastern and western coasts of Australia. Given the observed rates of increase, the current total Southern Hemisphere abundance is greater than 55, 000, which is similar to the summed northern breeding ground estimates (~ 60, 000 from 1999 – 2008). Some breeding ground abundance estimates are far greater, and others far lower, than the corresponding IDCR/SOWER estimates, in a pattern apparently related to the latitudinal position of the Antarctic Polar Front...|$|R
50|$|In Kentucky, the Jackson Purchase (the area {{west of the}} Tennessee River) {{is divided}} into townships and ranges. In Tennessee, the entire state is {{surveyed}} into townships and ranges that make up 13 survey districts of the Tennessee State Survey. In extreme northern Maine there is an area divided into townships and ranges oriented to true north. A region in {{the central part of}} the state, made up of 17 surveys, is divided into townships, but these are not oriented to true north. The remainder of the state is on metes and bounds. Similarly, Vermont and New Hampshire are mostly metes-and-bounds states, but have areas in the north that are surveyed into townships not oriented to true north. Most of Ohio is surveyed using the Public Land Survey System, but several sizable areas are metes-and-bounds, including the Virginia Military Reserve, Donation Tract, French Grant and the three Moravian grants (Gnadenhutten, Schoenbrunn and Salem). A 150,000 acre area in southern Indiana (Clark Grant) is not surveyed into townships, but is still a gridded survey. Portions of the Texas State Survey use square townships. Sizeable portions of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California and Arizona are <b>unsurveyed.</b> Substantial swampy <b>areas</b> in Florida and Louisiana are also unsurveyed.|$|R
40|$|Mapping and {{explaining}} {{the distribution of}} vegetation helps land managers to make systematic conservation planning decisions. This is typically achieved using models that correlate the distribution of species with environmental factors, and can predict the vegetation at unsurveyed locations. These Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have numerous unresolved issues, but serve as a useful first-pass approximation for planning purposes. This thesis investigates some of the uncertainties of SDMs, including the impact of data accuracy, the incorporation of spatial processes, the evaluation of alternative models, and the benefits and challenges of producing models at the landscape scale. The research {{was conducted on the}} Illawarra Escarpment, 80 km south of Sydney, Australia (34. 4 oS, 150. 9 oE). The escarpment contains a north-south trend in eucalypts (Eucalyptus spp.) that cannot be explained in terms of elevation or geology. It also exhibits a patchy distribution of rainforest communities, some unique to the Illawarra. It is not known which environmental factors determine the distribution of either the eucalypts or rainforest species, or how they may respond to a changing climate. Species distributions are sensitive to the accuracy of data used, and yet many models only use elevation as a surrogate for temperature, or use simple elevation sensitive interpolations from weather stations. I collected hourly temperature data from 40 sites on the Illawarra Escarpment, and investigated whether elevation was an adequate surrogate for temperatures in this landscape. I then investigated whether temperature surfaces could be improved by considering other topographic and geographic factors, including exposure to wind, distance to coast, radiation, and the average conditions in the surrounding neighbourhood. Elevation was well correlated with moderate seasonal temperatures (e. g. summer minima and winter maxima), but was poorly correlated with the extreme temperatures (summer maxima, winter minima) that are physiologically limiting for many species. Using neighbourhood influences, exposure to wind and distance to coast improved the accuracy of temperature surfaces, and increased the explanatory performance of vegetation models. I concluded that elevation was not always an adequate surrogate for temperature. Temperatures are also affected by other topographic and geographic factors, and these should be considered when developing models for systematic conservation planning activities. Species distribution models are typically based solely on niche factors. Where spatial processes are included, it is typically by employing autologistic regression, or other techniques that use survey data as a predictor. This precludes the models being used to make predictions in times or places where survey data is unavailable, and reduces ecological explanation because it is an interpolation technique. I used neighbourhood (contextual) indices based on environmental factors as an alternative method to overcome these problems. I demonstrate that contextual indices improve SDMs over purely niche-based models, and are capable of predicting unknown populations in <b>unsurveyed</b> <b>areas.</b> I conclude that contextual indices have numerous advantages over autologistic regression, and can capture a continuum between niche and dispersal limited species. Models that predict how species will respond to climate change either use coarse-scale climate surfaces, or idealised predictions of uniform warming. These methods may dramatically over-estimate extinction risk because they neglect fine-scale variations in warming, and refugia where species can persist despite unfavourable regional conditions. I created fine-scale estimates of warming by combining 35 years of Bureau of Meteorology observations with one year of intensive fine-scale temperature monitoring. I found that warming was greatest at inland locations, at lower elevations, away from streams, and at sites exposed to hot, dry northwesterly winds. As species are biased in the geographic and topographic positions they occupied, some species have experienced more warming than others and are at greater threat from climate change. I concluded {{that it was important to}} continue developing methods to downscale coarse-grained climate surfaces, and suggest that the accuracy of this process could be improved by using a range of topographic factors. There are many methods for selecting predictors in SDMs, and the competing models often make highly variable predictions. I addressed this uncertainty by comparing the performance of models with and without a given environmental factor. I found that there was relatively strong support for the geology and winter minimum temperature predictors, as well as predictors based on contextual indices, as there was a significant drop in model performance when these predictors were excluded. In contrast, there was less support for summer maximum temperature, as other temperature predictors could combine to produce similar model performance. Model performance varied more between models for different species than between different predictor combinations for the same species. I concluded that it was inappropriate to assess models based on subjective benchmarks, such as an AUC of more than 0. 7. A comparison between competing models for the same species gives a better indication of the validity of the model building procedure. The results of this research provide important insights into the benefits and challenges of creating SDMs at the landscape scale (extent of 10 – 200 km). It is a major challenge to obtain spatially and thematically accurate environmental predictors and biotic data at this scale, and studies should include the collection of data to ensure models are adequate. Landscapes will not have as much environmental variation as coarse-scale models, and this will limit the ability to transfer the models to new study areas. However, there are a number of benefits that justify these studies. Producing accurate temperature surfaces at the landscape scale will result in less pseudoreplication and less predictor colinearity. This will improve the robustness of models. Landscape scale studies also allow modellers to capture fine-scale refugia, and this will improve the accuracy of climate change predictions. Finally, many ecological processes operate at a scale that is too fine to be detected with coarse-scale models. Landscape scale models may be the only alternative to detect these processes. There is no optimal scale for SDMs, however, and a future challenge is to better integrate coarse and fine-scale models to make more ecologically robust predictions...|$|R
