5|$|The {{leaves are}} unbound and {{are kept in}} loose quires. The text is written in late <b>uncial</b> script, in two columns per page, with mostly 19 lines per column, in large <b>uncial</b> letters. Palaeographically the writing {{is close to the}} Codex Seidelianus I.|$|E
5|$|The text is {{surrounded}} by a marginal commentary; it is the only codex that has both text and commentary in <b>uncial</b> script. The commentary is a catena of quotations of nine church fathers: Origen, Eusebius, Titus of Bostra, Basil, Isidore of Pelusium, Cyril of Alexandria, Sever from Antioch, Victor from Antioch, and Chrysostom. The commentary surrounds the single-column text of Luke on three sides. Patristic text is written in small <b>uncial</b> letters. Most of the quotations are those of Ciril of Alexandria (93 scholia); next comes Titus of Bostra (45 scholia). The commentary was written in a different kind of <b>uncial</b> script than the biblical text.|$|E
5|$|The Codex Vaticanus (The Vatican, Bibl. Vat., Vat. gr. 1209; no. B or 03 Gregory-Aland, δ 1 von Soden) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} extant manuscripts of the Greek Bible (Old and New Testament), one of the four great <b>uncial</b> codices. The Codex is named after its place of {{conservation}} in the Vatican Library, where it has been kept since at least the 15th century. It is written on 759 leaves of vellum in <b>uncial</b> letters and has been dated palaeographically to the 4th century.|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century, the Codex Bezae {{was also}} {{included}} {{to the group}} of the great <b>uncials</b> (F. H. A. Scrivener, Burgon). According to Dean Burgon, the five great <b>uncials</b> (א A B C D) were the by-products of innovation; this view is at odds with the scholarly consensus of modern critical New Testament scholarship.|$|R
50|$|The {{text of the}} Codex agrees {{generally}} {{with the}} Byzantine text-type in close relationship to the Codex Petropolitanus Purpureus. The Rossano Gospels, along with the manuscripts N, O, and Φ, belong {{to the group of}} the Purple <b>Uncials</b> (or purple codices). Aland placed all four manuscripts of the group (the Purple <b>Uncials)</b> in Category V.|$|R
5|$|The codex {{consists}} of parchment, originally in double sheets, {{which may have}} measured about 40 by 70cm. The whole codex consists, with a few exceptions, of quires of eight leaves, a format popular throughout the Middle Ages. Each line of the text has some twelve to fourteen Greek <b>uncial</b> letters, arranged in four columns (48 lines per column) with carefully chosen line breaks and slightly ragged right edges. When opened, the eight columns thus presented to the reader have much the same appearance as the succession of columns in a papyrus roll. The poetical books of the Old Testament are written stichometrically, in only two columns per page. The codex has almost 4,000,000 <b>uncial</b> letters.|$|E
5|$|Codex Boreelianus, Codex Boreelianus Rheno-Trajectinus (full name), {{designated}} by Fe or 09 in the Gregory-Aland numbering and ε 86 in von Soden numbering, is a 9th (or 10th) century <b>uncial</b> manuscript {{of the four}} Gospels in Greek. The manuscript, written on parchment, is full of lacunae (or gaps), many of which arose between 1751 and 1830. The codex was named Boreelianus after Johannes Boreel (1577–1629), who brought it from the East.|$|E
5|$|Codex Carolinus is a Gothic-Latin diglot <b>uncial</b> {{manuscript}} of the New Testament on parchment, dated to the 6th or 7th century. The Gothic text is designated by siglum Car, the Latin text is designated by siglum gue (traditional system) or by 79 (on {{the list of}} Beuron), it represents the Old Latin translation of the New Testament. It is housed in the Herzog August Bibliothek.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} {{occasional}} scholia in <b>uncials</b> at the margin, with some critical notes.|$|R
50|$|Including {{about a dozen}} <b>uncials</b> (the {{earliest}} being Codex Alexandrinus) and in all undamaged minuscules.|$|R

5|$|The codex is an Alexandrian text-type {{manuscript}} {{written in}} the 4th century in <b>uncial</b> letters on parchment. Scholarship considers the Codex Sinaiticus {{to be one of}} the best Greek texts of the New Testament, along with the Codex Vaticanus. Until the discovery by Constantin von Tischendorf of the Sinaiticus text, the Codex Vaticanus was unrivaled.|$|E
5|$|The letters Η, Μ, Ν, and Π, are square, {{the letters}} Ε, Θ, Ο, Σ, and Φ have a round shape. The letters Δ, Ε, Θ, Ο, and {{especially}} Ψ in cruciform, {{are of the}} form characteristic for the late <b>uncial</b> script. Φ is large and bevelled at both ends. The letters were written by an 'elegant and careful' hand.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{text of the}} {{manuscript}} contains fragments of the chapters 1:1-11:33 of the Gospel of Luke. The codex comprises 86 thick, coarse parchment leaves and three partial leaves; it measures 36 x 29cm. The text was written in a single column with well-formed <b>uncial</b> script. The letters are large, round and narrow, without spiritus asper, spiritus lenis, or accents. The manuscript was written by two scribes.|$|E

5|$|William Hatch in 1937, on {{the basis}} of palaeographical data, {{suggested}} that the codex should be dated to the 6th century. It does not use breathings and accents and the text of the commentary is written in <b>uncial</b> script. Aland supported Hatch's point of view. This date is accepted by the majority of scholars.|$|E
5|$|Along with Codex Vaticanus, the Codex Sinaiticus is {{considered}} one of the most valuable manuscripts for establishing the original text (textual criticism) of the Greek New Testament, as well as the Septuagint. It is the only <b>uncial</b> manuscript with the complete text of the New Testament, and the only ancient manuscript of the New Testament written in four columns per page which has survived to the present day. With only 300 years separating the Codex Sinaiticus and the proposed lifetime of Jesus, it {{is considered}} to be more accurate than most later New Testament copies in preserving superior readings where many later manuscripts are in error.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} {{manuscript}} of great importance and antiquity of which any extensive use was made by textual critics, but {{the value of the}} codex was differently appreciated by different writers in the past. Wettstein created a modern system of catalogization of the New Testament manuscripts. Codex Alexandrinus received symbol A and opened the list of the NT <b>uncial</b> manuscripts. Wettstein announced in his Prolegomena ad Novi Testamenti Graeci (1730) that Codex A is the oldest and the best manuscript of New Testament, and should be the basis in every reconstruction of the New Testament text. Codex Alexandrinus became a basis for criticizing the Textus Receptus (Wettstein, Woide, Griesbach).|$|E
