5|$|Within {{two days}} of the cyclone striking, the Sri Lankan Red Cross began an {{operation}} with 4,000volunteers to help those most badly affected. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies issued a preliminary appeal for $323,000 2000USD ($ USD, $ in 2000CHF) to assist about 10,000people by making blankets, shelter, food, and kitchen <b>utensils</b> available. To kick-start the operation, the Federation released about $61,000 (2000USD ($ USD, $ in 2000CHF)) {{within a few hours}} of the cyclone making landfall. After about a month, the Red Cross distributed 10 roofing sheets each to 1,720 families, and also sent a set of cooking <b>utensils,</b> bed sheets, and sleeping mats to 3,000families.

50|$|The {{scientists}} {{showed that}} when the apes were presented with a food item {{in conjunction with a}} <b>utensil</b> {{that could be used to}} actually eat that particular food, these animals chose the <b>utensil</b> instead of food. They anticipated a future need for the <b>utensil</b> that overcame the current want for just a food reward. This is an example of mental time travel in animals. It was not a result of associative learning that they actually chose the <b>utensil</b> instead of the food reward since the scientists ran another experiment to account for that. Other examples, such as food caching by birds, may be examples of mental time travel in non-humans. Even survival instinct by certain animals such as elephants, in response to imminent danger, could involve mental time travel mechanisms.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the block}} is homogeneous, DOE {{efficiency}} tests cannot distinguish between vessel and content. In real use, {{a small fraction}} of heat accumulated by the cooking <b>utensil</b> is left behind when it is removed, and is finally lost when the <b>utensil</b> cools down. This loss, and energy similarly lost in heating up the <b>utensil,</b> is likely to be very significant when heating up small amounts of food in a short time, and for maximum efficiency it is always important to use the optimum size and shape of pan (tall pans can waste heat through the sides).|$|R
