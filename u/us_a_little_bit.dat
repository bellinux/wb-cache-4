Speaking on the incident, he said that Edwards [...] "got a great run on us and drove down into one and got in {{the back of}} <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> I don’t know if I cut him off or not.

500|$|Navy {{athletic}} director Chet Gladchuk stated that Maryland's snub {{was the basis}} for their rejection of Maryland offers to renew the series in 2010: [...] "The stage was set for everything we had talked about, and all the good things that could have happened for fans—a big rematch, a bowl setting, a great city ...

Coach Brian McLaughlin commented, [...] "He Dembele gave <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of energy. He's very, very brave on the ball". Dembele made a further appearance {{a few days later}} in a 3 - 0 defeat against the Republic of Ireland, again coming on as a second-half substitute. However, prior to participating in the Victory Shield, Dembele traveled south in October 2016 to train with England under-15s at St George's Park. On 18 November 2016, Dembele confirmed his intention to join up with the England U15s ahead of a match against Turkey that December. On 17 December 2016, Dembele came off the bench against Turkey to make his England debut and assisted a goal in a 5-2 victory.|$|E
5000|$|... "'Reasonable Ease...' is {{technically}} very variant with fast bits, slow bits, etc, {{but what we}} play within those parts is actually quite simple. On the other hand, a track like 'Better than Myself' is structurally very straightforward, but the parts we play that make up that structure are more technically difficult than a track that appears superficially to be pretty tricky. I guess it's {{safe to say that}} most of our songs are challenging in some way, even 'School' has a quirky time change throughout that means we can't fall asleep in the middle of it! In short, all our songs are fun to play. No-one ever complains that a part is boring for them to play, or if they do they get told to shut up and use their imagination to liven it up. I think that's what makes <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> better than a straightforward punk band." [...] Cay drummer Mark Bullock on Cay’s technical approach to playing songs Cay drew on a variety of influences, predominantly “punky, grungy” material such as Nirvana, Sonic Youth and The Sex Pistols (which, in tandem with Mook’s hoarse and lacerating vocals, brought them comparisons to Hole which they ultimately found unwelcome). However, the band would also cite more diverse influences (such as Robert Fripp, or Mook’s childhood love of diva singers including Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand and Billie Holiday). The band's approach was often more technically exploratory than many of their peers, leading to further comparisons with bands such as Gang of Four and Nomeansno.|$|E

5000|$|In 2009, Mark Miller, co-head of Barker's {{production}} company, Seraphim Films, helped {{track down}} the missing footage that was {{cut out of the}} director's cut of Nightbreed. Miller discovered, after talking to a production executive at the studio, that the footage was never actually lost but readily accessible. When asked, a studio executive said that there was not a big enough audience to warrant the studio spending money on a new, extended cut of the film. A VHS copy of Barker's 145-minute version of the film's mid-1989 workprint was discovered. It did not feature any of the re-shoots of Decker's murders. An extended 159-minute cut version, from another VHS found in July 2009, was premiered on March 27, 2010 as part of the HorrorHound Weekend in Indianapolis. This new version adds almost a whole hour that was cut from the theatrical release, including a musical score and more animation.

6000|$|... 16. Although in all lovely nature there is, first, an {{excellent}} degree of simple beauty, {{addressed to the}} eye alone, yet often what impresses us most will form but a very small portion of that visible beauty. That beauty may, for instance, be composed of lovely flowers, and glittering streams, and blue sky and white clouds; and yet the thing that impresses us most, and which we should be sorriest to lose, may be a thin grey film on the extreme horizon, not so large, {{in the space of}} the scene it occupies, as a piece of gossamer on a near-at-hand bush, nor in any wise prettier to the eye than the gossamer; but because the gossamer is known by <b>us</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of spider's work, and the other grey film is known to mean a mountain ten thousand feet high, inhabited by a race of noble mountaineers, we are solemnly impressed by the aspect of it, and yet all the while the thoughts and knowledge which cause us to receive this impression are so obscure that we are not conscious of them.|$|R

And the other one said, 'That's what I thought too.' We felt that Spike had got to where we were trying to get to, but if you'd asked us the previous day, we couldn't have described very well what that was.

Running second is great but nobody is going to really remember that. But we're proud of it.” “Yeah, just very happy to finish there in the top three,” said Johnson. “I thought we had a shot at a win.

Mercosur is a common market like is Europe and with our neighbours we also have many coincidences. a globalised world all countries are interconnected and {{it is out of}} the questions trying to isolate Paraguay from other countries. The OAS has already began to understand our politics, that we’re a sovereign country, all was done according to the book and the Constitution." [...] Upon being sworn in he said: [...] "I'm not in politics to make a career of it or become wealthier. I'm in politics to serve my people, make the future better for new generations and build up our identity as a free, independent and sovereign people." [...] His inauguration was attended by fellow conservative South American, Chilean President Sebastián Piñera who said: [...] "I want to say to President Horacio Cartes that we are very expectant about his future achievements. The slogan of his campaign was 'new directions,' and every country needs new directions and to be confronted with new challenges...the challenge of integration in our Latin America is still a pending challenge and the experience of the Pacific Alliance was a great experience which has been very fruitful."

40|$|There was {{a strong}} dispute, in the XVIIIth century, about the "true definition" of "force of a certain body". The {{controversy}} {{had to do with}} the ideas of vis viva and momentum, and involved the followers of Leibniz and Descartes. Despite the fact that the very idea of a "force of a certain body" may seem to <b>us,</b> nowadays, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> clumsy, that interpretative dispute was completely meaningful in that particular historical moment. If we consider D'Alembert's contribution to make a distinction between the spatial and temporal evolution of force, we may sometimes be led to believe that the above mentioned controversy is completely overcome. As we demonstrate in this paper, some experienced teachers of physics are usually encountered showing some doubts similar to those historical ones occurred in XVIIIth century. A simple piece of apparatus was constructed in order to investigate this issue. Its main goal was to provoke some doubts about the conceptual distinction between kinetic energy and linear momentum. A case study approach was adopted to investigate the opinions of three teachers of physics, all three with more than ten years experience. Their responses exhibit similar epistemological obstacles to those someone could encounter in the minds of XVIIIth century physicists...|$|R

Nevertheless there is plenty for the fans to love and for newcomers to enjoy. All in all, I believe that Everything is Different Now sets the standard and is the foundation from which Stellar Kart will continue to work on. As a massive improvement on their past efforts, it goes to show how bands can develop and get better with time. This LP reminds <b>us</b> how far <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of change can go in the journey of development … I’m hoping that their next release will revolutionize everything again, and let us join them on their adventure." ...|$|R
