40|$|Over {{three decades}} of rapid {{economic}} growth in China, beginning in 1978, {{has been accompanied by}} ever-enlarging urban-rural inequalities in terms of the various aspects of income, welfare, infrastructure, medical treatment, and education (amongst others). These two parts – the urban and the rural - have long been treated separately, without much consideration being given to their mutual linkages (relations). Urban and rural development can, essentially, be interpreted as the deployment of key factors (terms of trade for agricultural products, land requisition, and labor transfer), and the supply of public goods and services (infrastructure, education, insurance, and medical care). Thus, the urban-rural inequalities experienced by China at present can be understood as the consequence of the factor flows (labor, capital, goods, information, and technology, etc.) and agglomeration between these two parts. This thesis aims to investigate <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations</b> in China in the post-reform era, and their influences on the economic, social, and environmental development in both the urban and the rural areas. The thesis consists of five papers and the cover essay. The first two papers provide a detailed picture of <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations</b> in China, while the other papers examine the impact of <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations</b> in terms of population mobility, arable and built land use change, and regional economic inequality in the study area. The findings of the thesis reveal that <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations</b> in China became gradually intensified in the post-reform era, especially when the central government initiated a shift from a situation of urban bias to comprehensive support for the rural areas. However, the mutual resource flows in the study area still tend to agglomerate in the urban districts, while only reaching the rural peripheries to a limited extent. This is demonstrated {{in the way in which}} the urban districts experienced fast and large scale demographic growth and land use change, while slow and small-scale demographic and land use change took place in the peripheries. The urban-rural interface, which is situated between the urban and rural areas, evidences medium-level resource agglomeration. This thesis, through the discussion which it sets out, emphasizes the necessity of exercising both political and market forces in order to achieve balanced urban-rural resource flows in China. Another implication for policy making is to develop more sub-centers at the peri-urban or periphery, making these areas the interface for urban-rural resource linkages. QC 2011090...|$|E

Huanjiang village is located in Linhuashan Scenic Area in the middle east of Liuzhou city, with spectacular landscape and traditional features. Nowadays Huanjiang village has become a so-called "village in city", which is considered full of great potential for development because of the economic value of regional advantages during the urban sprawl. Communities of village found it difficult to acclimatize with the dramatic changes, which later led to numerous problems including ecological damage, unemployment of landless farmers and loss of traditional culture. Government has started up a series of renewal planings to resolve the problems, which are based on advanced technology and conform to sustainable and integrated strategies of city planning considering the original context and historical culture, superseding the traditional arrangements based on the guide of extensive economic growth. This paper aims to elaborate the context of Liuzhou city and Huanjiang village offered to both the traditional and sustainable planning approaches, in order to understand challenges and solutions of the rebuilding process.

A clear polarization in urban and rural areas is more difficult {{due to the lack of}} adequate statistical indicators or deployment of institutions with different degree of importance, population density and distance from major city, providing sufficiently clear evidence of the degree of urbanity of local communities. This can be best seen in the Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) which is sparsely populated country with an average of 74 inhabitants/km 2. Since there is a clear correlation between this indicator and sustainable development, increasing urbanization rates, which can stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty, is set as the primary social objective.

To study changes in assemblage structure, abundance and species richness, these taxa were collected in the year 2000 using pitfall traps, which {{had been placed in}} four forest sites within each of the urban, suburban and rural zones. We expected to find changes in the abundances and species richnesses in the two taxa across the urban–rural gradient, but did not find any. Our second and third hypotheses, stating that generalist species and small-bodied species should gain dominance along the gradient from rural to urban sites, were partly supported as carabid specialists were more characteristic of suburban and rural environments whereas generalists {{were more likely to be}} collected from rural areas compared to suburban or urban sites. Furthermore, medium to large-sized carabid individuals were more likely to be collected in the rural sites compared to urban forests. We found no evidence for significant changes in spider abundance or species richness across the <b>urban–rural</b> gradient in <b>relation</b> to body size or habitat specialization. We suggest that urbanization does not have significant effects on the total abundances and species richnesses in these two taxa. However, individual species responded differently to urbanization, and there were significant differences in the specialization and body sizes of carabids across the gradient...|$|R

A ‘New Deal’ in <b>Urban-Rural</b> <b>Relations.</b> Beginning {{with the}} new century a new concept of {{regional}} planning has established itself in Europe, being strongly related to long-term development, especially in post-industrial countries. Although the conceptual debate about such regions started relatively late, it has gained {{an important role in}} spatial planning and research.

The present paper aims to deal with the metropolization processes in Europe, comparing the main attitudes and approaches towards this concept, examining the way in which metropolitan regions have been understood in the academic literature. The paper aims also to gather and improve knowledge on the recent theoretical background which has promoted or has acted as the starting points in developing and elaborating metropolitan regions policies...|$|E

Some critical and appealing cases are shown, involving the “popular” fractals. In particular the most surprising property of fractional dimension is defined and shown by examples. The section that joins theory with actual world is important since it shows that some approximating mathematical tools can be used as powerful instruments for dealing with real world. Examples of spatial boundaries are given, namely hard boundaries versus distributed boundaries.

40|$|Much of the {{development}} literature and the theory of urban transition {{have been based on}} an arbitrary division of production space into city and countryside. Despite growing recognition of the need for an integrated approach to <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations,</b> controversial issues related to the definition and measurements of the phenomenon remain unresolved. This case study of spatial transformation in China's Pearl River Delta analyzes with greater precision the geographic extent and functional attributes of a zone of urban-rural interaction located outside and between major metropolitan centers. This zone has been the spatial focus of industrial and commercial development, although most of its population remains officially classified as "agricultural. " The peri-urban zone was initially left behind by the central cities in terms of its contribution to the regional economy. After a decade of postreform development, this zone has moved ahead of the central cities and become the region's main destination for in-migrants and foreign investment. The growth of the zone of urban-rural interaction outside the central cities has absorbed a significant amount of the increased urban population, but it has not brought about a reduction of regional economic inequality because of the persistence of a backward economy in the periphery. Theoretical questions are raised concerning the validity of several fundamental assumptions underlying the conventional model of urban transition. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

In the context of pre-industrial societies, two social pro-cesses with the greatest potential impact on the environment and on changing human-environmental interaction are urbanization and the development of diversi ed, regional-scale production systems such as intensive agri-culture, pastoralism and exploitation of maritime resources. This paper employs archaeological and geological data from the Jequetepeque and Zana valleys on the north coast desert of Peru to study: (1) the speci c responses of Moche, Chimu and Inca societies (c. ad 250 – 1553) to major episodes of drought, El Niño ooding, and deserti cation; (2) the social processes of <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations</b> and economic diversi cation; and (3) how these processes interacted within the dynamic arid north coast.

During {{the last four decades}} the traditional urban-rural dichotomy has given its place to complex spatial patterns which are in a process of continuous change. This change {{is the result of a}} variety of factors such as the international economic environment, the emergence of new economic activities in rural areas, mainly the service sector and tourism, the changing <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations</b> as well as the implementation of national and European policies for the agricultural sector and for rural development. In addition, rural development is not any longer dependent solely on the agricultural sector but also on the rural- urban relationships and the presence of a large variety of economic activities in rural areas. In this paper data concerning demographic, economic and infrastructure characteristics of rural areas are analyzed for the last five population Censuses, describing the transformation of rural space in Greece. A number of typologies of rural areas in Greece are presented for different time periods which demonstrate the significant changes of rural patterns in the last two decades. These typologies are employed in order to suggest policy guidelines for rural development in Greece. The results will be presented in a GIS environment and when appropriate will be compared to similar studies in Europe. Finally policies for agricultural and rural development, in the context of European regional and spatial development, will be examined in relation to rural patterns in Greece and the development perspectives of rural areas. ...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{comprehensive}} study of allotment gardens {{in the province of}} Alicante, this article enhances research on urban agriculture in two ways. Firstly, we explain the specific histories of urban allotments in Spain, that differ from the well-rehearsed stories of North America and also Northern Europe. Secondly, we show that a focus on urban allotments can provide a better understanding of changes in the economy, in land-use and in <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations</b> in times of crisis. After two decades of Spain’s “urbanization tsunami”, in the mid 2000 s a new way of combining urban life with agricultural functions emerged: through allotments, municipalities intended to promote environmentally-oriented leisure activities, enhance urban green landscapes and revive traditional vegetable gardens (huertas). At first, these projects catered mostly to pensioners, including foreigners coming from countries with long traditions of urban allotments. As the economic recession intensified in 2009, allotments had to re-define their goals in a social environment now defined by high unemployment and impoverishment. Today, most of the projects target people at risk of poverty and social exclusion and their primary functions are productive, therapeutic and educational. We also show that the global economic crisis of 2008 in a way contributed to the revaluation of agricultural land use, although the spectre of land-speculation is still very present. Part of this research was supported through the project "Espacios y prácticas económicas alternativas para la construcción de la resiliencia en las ciudades españolas" (2016 - 2018), reference CSO 2015 - 65452 -R, funded by the Spanish Economy and Competitivity Ministry...|$|E
40|$|The urban/peri-urban {{phenomenon}} is frequently studied as a territorial landscape for urban expansion, {{and a good}} deal of scholarship chronicles aspects of land annexation, housing construction, and infrastructure. But the question of how peri-urban water resources have been reallocated to serve urban needs has not received sufficient scholarly attention. Peri-urban water reallocation demands examination in arid regions where water is a critical resource. Mexico's northwest region represents {{one of the most critical}} examples; the most-drought prone region in Mexico, it is characterized by over-drafted groundwater sources and rapid urban growth. In this research, based on the case of Hermosillo, Sonora, I develop three distinct, yet related themes to examine the peri-urban phenomenon. First, this work draws on the notion of the "hydrosocial cycle" (Swyngedouw, 2004) to examine geographies of power at the urban-rural interface. Following Swyngedouw, we argue that urban water augmentation strategies reveal a distinct set of <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations</b> of uneven social power where peri-urban water resources are "metabolized" in urban areas, reflecting the demands of powerful, politically connected urban individuals and populations over more disparate and marginalized rural producers. The Hermosillo case indicates that small-scale farming communities or ejidos are the most vulnerable water users because of their lack of political power in the governmental decision making process. Second, in this work, I examine how peri-urban rural livelihoods have been reshaped by cities' water reallocation causing ejidatarios in many cases to lose their livelihoods, but without creating new urban jobs as an alternative means of subsistence, resulting in a net negative outcome for ejido members. Finally, this research evaluates the land use/cover change dynamics and their effects in the peri-urban area of the city of Hermosillo. This study demonstrates that urban expansion causes at least two other types of land use/cover changes (LUCC) beyond the urban fringe that are not usually considered in LUCC studies. The research demonstrates that urban expansion in the peri-urban land is a broader and more complex phenomenon than previously understood and examines how water transfers act as a driver of land use/cover change...|$|E

Analyses of census population data 2006 confirm it, and present positive dynamics far away of cities in remote country districts. These places symbolised archaism and social confinement. Today, {{they represent a}} new way of life for many heterogeneous populations, who are going to live there for familial motives, environment or economic reasons. The urban-rural migrations clearly represent main processes of sociodemographic changes in French countrysides, and in many international contexts (1). Rural gentrification is a form of migration towards rural areas, undertaken by populations of middle and upper classes from cities. They participate in deep transformations of demographic, socioeconomic and housing structures, which have been first analysed in British cases (2). Can we identify same processes in French countrysides? According to life course analyses (3), French's rural areas are also characterized by high proportion of older and retired, living and coming in country districts. What part do they play in repopulation of rural areas, mainly high incomes? Which places are particularly concerned? We propose quantitative statistical and cartographic treatments, to analyse interactions between processes of rural gentrification and ageing. We use several data resources (sociodemographic, income, housing) on whole France, with small geographic scales and aggregated areas, to realise spatial analyses of <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations</b> and intra-rural.

40|$|The {{most recent}} and {{significant}} transformations of European landscapes have occurred {{as a consequence}} of a series of diffused, varied and often connected phenomena: urban growth and sprawl, agricultural intensification in the most suitable areas and agricultural abandonment in marginal areas. These phenomena can affect dramatically ecosystems' structure and functioning, since certain modifications cause landscape fragmentation while others tend to increase homogeneity. Thus, a thorough comprehension of the evolution trends of landscapes, in particular those linked to <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations,</b> is crucial for a sustainable landscape planning. In this framework, the main objectives of the present paper are: (a) to investigate Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) transformations and dynamics occurred over the period 1955 – 2006 in the municipality of Serra San Bruno (Calabria, Italy), an area particularly representative of the Mediterranean mountainous landscape; (b) to compare the settlement growth with the urban planning tools in charge in the study area; (c) {{to examine the relationship between}} urban-rural gradient, landscape metrics, demographic and physical variables; (d) to investigate the evolution of urban-rural gradient composition and configuration along significant axes of landscape changes. Data with a high level of detail (minimum mapping unit 0. 2 ha) were obtained through the digitisation of historical aerial photographs and digital orthophotos identifying LULC classes according to the Corine Land Cover legend. The investigated period was divided into four significant time intervals, which were specifically analysed to detect LULC changes. Differently from previous studies, in the present research the spatio-temporal analysis of urban-rural gradient was performed through three subsequent steps: (1) kernel density analysis of settlements; (2) analysis of landscape structure by means of metrics calculated using a moving window method; (3) analysis of composition and configuration of the urban-rural gradient within three landscape profiles located along significant axes of LULC change. The use of thematic overlays and transition matrices enabled a precise identification of the LULC changes that had taken place over the examined period. As a result, a detailed description and mapping of the landscape dynamics were obtained. Furthermore, landscape profiling technique, using continuous data, allowed an innovative and valuable approach for analysing and interpreting urban-rural gradient structure over space and time...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{thesis is}} a critical assessment {{of the relationship of}} rural development policy within the second pillar of the EU CAP framework to aspects of territorial cohesion. The main aim is to analyse if the tools of rural development policy applied within the Czech Republic are in accordance with EU territorial cohesion goals and to assess the importance of the differences in the extent of regional support in accordance to the problems in rural areas. Within the main aim four hypotheses are formulated which are analysed in detail. For the verification of the hypotheses, introductory theoretical-methodological analysis of approaches to agriculture and rural development were prepared and their critical assessment was focused on historical issues of the EU CAP. The next part of the thesis is aimed at the verification of the rural development policy {{within the framework of the}} second pillar of the EU CAP to aspects of territorial cohesion using the example of the implementation of the EU Territorial Agenda in the programming period of 2007 [...] 2013 in the Czech Republic. These issues are further studied in more depth with an institutional analysis of the EU CAP rural development policy role and its importance in the realisation of the EU Territorial Agenda in the Czech Republic, especially within the framework of <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations.</b> For defining the territorial cohesion goals a methodological approach from the research project conducted by Prof. Mark Shucksmith (project ESPON, Shucksmith et al., 2005) was used who dealt with an assessment of the second pillar of the EU CAP in relation to aspects of territorial cohesion. In his research project the territorial cohesion goals were assessed by levels of selected indicators and their relevance to support from the second pillar of the EU CAP. This approach was adjusted and studied in depth by the author of this thesis according to the conditions of the Czech Republic. For the verification of the hypotheses, statistical data of the Horizontal Rural Development Plan CR was used which represented 73 % of the total expenditure of the second pillar of the EU CAP in the Czech Republic during the period 2004 [...] 2006. With regards to scientific contribution, the main benefit of this thesis is in delivering an analytical framework of the rural development policy in relation to aspects of territorial cohesion by way of the EU Territorial Agenda and its implementation in the Czech Republic. The analysis and assessment of the HRDP programme in the Czech Republic and its relationship to socio economic indicators presents a concrete verification of the implementation of the second pillar of the EU CAP in the period 2004 [...] 2006 with aspects of territorial cohesion. The results of this thesis will contribute to current research projects also aimed at the analysis of this theme...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{security}} {{provision in}} the state of Somaliland. More specifically it looks into which security providers are present and which are people utilising. At the same time it goes into looking at how different groups access security providers and whether their choices can provide perspectives on why these providers might be chosen by specific groups. This paper presents an overall discussion into how different groups view security providers and how historical, social or cultural aspects might precondition their access. Theoretically speaking an emphasis is placed on trying to see how actors define the categories themselves, what is considered a crime or a dispute, and how these categorisations are linked to security provision. Going into more detail, the main research question of this paper is: Which are the security providers that the population of Somaliland utilise and what is the impact of this on access to provision of security? In order to answer this question two different approaches were utilised: one of them quantitative and one qualitative. The quantitative data was collected by the Danish Demining Group (DDG) through their Community Safety Assessment (CSA) and provides the basis for examining which are the security providers the population utilises? Through a statistical analysis of the data it is possible to come to the following conclusions: •	The main security providers in Somaliland are traditional leaders, the police and religious leaders •	Out of these three, the main providers of security are traditional leaders and the police. •	There are groups that because of their composition, for example as minority clans, express very varying opinions to other groups in terms of their choices of security providers. The disparities can be seen in: minority clans, <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations,</b> students, and women of different professions – housewives and traders. Qualitative analysis and looking at these groups and their access to security provision through different perspectives helped identify the main areas which impact access to security providers, which are: •	Access to representation: throughout the different perspectives in different groups it became clear that access to representation through traditional leaders is conditioned to status. Therefore groups that {{do not have access to}} status, such as women, youth or minorities, will not have access to equal representation by the traditional leaders. •	Difficulties in access: groups might have difficulties in at all accessing security providers. This is mainly the case for minorities as their status is preconditioned to historical and social developments, which did not allow them to access traditional leaders. At the same time, there is a question of actual physical access for other groups – such as rural inhabitants, coupled with a historical over reliance of the state on traditional structures in areas in which they cannot provide security. •	Multiplicity of actors: Somaliland has three parallel legal systems that operate without competing with each other. Though this allows a certain amount of forum shopping, there are no standards as to how the different systems operate in regards to different groups. There is no pattern or regulation as to the outcome, which puts certain groups, such as women, in a disadvantage as they cannot navigate through the different systems and might be pressurised into utilising one security provider, as they are not informed of others. As part of looking into security provision this paper also examines in depth elements of security provision like the categorisation of crimes and disputes. With the multiple systems available in Somaliland crimes or disputes do not have rigid definitions and the paper gives perspectives on how these categories are defined in Somaliland...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to show the {{regional}} inequalities and special features of Central and Eastern Europe which is considered a region still in transition. In other words, the purpose is to classify cities and urban regions. Today, we can see a revival of urban research. As focal points of regional and national economic growth, development and competitiveness, cities are the venues of spatial processes taking place in a fairly concentrated form. This study seeks to describe today’s major efforts in the field of city and urban region analyses as well as to highlight the various interpretations and methodologies of the same. Furthermore, the study identifies urban performance indicators and “draws” a map of the urban network of Central and Eastern Europe. Based on numerous literature sources, the study deals with several spatial levels from the “actual” urban level to the research projects completed at a regional level. The study starts by presenting spatial and methodological information on the flagships (the so-called MEGA areas) of polycentric regional development, and arrives at an important conclusion about the primary role played by Berlin and Vienna in the region. Actually, the “new” capitals represent the secondary line, while the weak MEGAs at the bottom of the urban hierarchy act as development hubs in the region. Even the contours of a new integration zone become visible in the region. This zone is forming along Pan-European corridor VI with the involvement of Vienna, Prague, Bratislava, Budapest (and Zagreb). Another major data source for urban-level measurements is the urban audit, coordinated by Eurostat, which has already supplied databases for a multitude of studies. This source represents a substantial innovation in urban research efforts as it includes multi-layer data, contains long statistical data series and allows comparisons in both time and space. Nevertheless, it also has many disadvantages including, in particular, lack of data and national features in the delimitation of urban agglomerations. In my opinion, this fact makes a lot of analytical surveys unreliable. One of the most widespread analyses of the rural/urban issue is the version adapted to NUTS 3 and based on population density. Developed formerly by the OECD, this model has undergone many changes. As a result, its recent versions place greater emphasis on the role of cities. The research results of Bengs and Schmidt-Thomé (ESPON 1. 1. 2) have contributed to the clarification of <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations</b> at the level of NUTS 3. This survey draws the demarcation lines of urban regions in view of population density as well as other factors (central town status of the region, land use indicators). In my effort to further differentiate the notion of the city as a territorial unit, I have found several publications using the expression of metropolitan regions or metro regions. The special region is defined as the cities and urban agglomerations shown in the urban audit, which are manifested at NUTS 3 level(s). Unique efforts are seen in the ESPON FOCI project, where the units of observation are the city areas and their regional hinterland. Accordingly, a city is “not always a city” because its smaller or bigger agglomeration or hinterland is almost always present in the various social or economic surveys of the given region. Based on a review of the main European documents, I may state that the efforts launched to classify cities and urban agglomerations are fairly wide-ranging. What is more, the associated interpretations and methodologies are also diverse. According to my literature review, the primary and supplementary factors of urban performance are the following: economic output, economic structure, accessibility, demography, innovative performance, infocommunications and land use indicators. Similarly to the varied picture found regarding the categorisation of cities and urban agglomerations, the Central and Eastern European urban network is also very differentiated depending on the spatial level of the actual analysis...|$|E
40|$|Le “Agricolture urbanizzate” sono l’insieme di pratiche e sperimentazioni variamente connesse alla multifunzionalità agricola nei territori della diffusione insediativa. Il lavoro di tesi delinea una strategia di paesaggio come modalità di lavoro concreta e ripetibile per la messa a punto di questi nuovi paesaggi metropolitani, forme {{innovative}} di equilibrio tra politica, agricoltura e comunità, e occasione di sperimentazione d’iniziative di Innovazione sociale. La proposta scaturisce da un’originale disamina sull’attuale “grado di fertilità” delle teorie di paesaggio di Richard Ingersoll e Pierre Donadieu {{rispetto a}} soggetti, spazi, comportamenti e politiche coinvolti nella descrizione di una possibile geografia contemporanea delle relazioni città/campagna. La valorizzazione dei contesti metropolitani locali quale obiettivo della strategia presuppone il rifiuto di una visione vincolistica del progetto di paesaggio e lo svolgimento di Laboratori di progettualità sociale, azione-chiave per la costruzione delle nuove Agricolture Urbanizzate. La Green Infrastructure è assunta come vero e proprio “dispositivo di sistema” della strategia, strumento di progetto duttile e declinabile in grado di superare i problemi di frammentazione spaziale, funzionale, e amministrativa della città contemporanea. La proposta s’inquadra nello scenario economico relativo al Periodo di Programmazione Europea 2014 - 2020. This thesis outlines a landscape strategy {{for what the}} author defines “Urbanised Agricultures”, and signifies a set of practices and experimentations variously associated with multifunctional agriculture, the latter being a target of European policies since years. The expression landscape strategy defines an assemblage of policies and local actions able both to restore and enhance peculiarities and dissimilarities of local metropolitan contexts (including their environmental, economic and social resources) and to fuel a new sociality, green economies, and innovative spatial configurations suitable for contemporary living needs. The thesis sketches a landscape strategy which does not coincide with an a priori pre-figuration of space. It is rather a tool to manage ordinary territorial transformations and to hold together a variety of heterogeneous but coherent interventions, mutually conditioning. These interventions can be implemented through different actions and through the involvement of public and/or private entities, at different times. For this reason, although conceived for the territory of Rome, the landscape strategy here proposed is of general interest: it can be adapted and repeated in other European metropolitan areas. Three essential features characterise the landscape strategy: - Peculiarities and differences for new Urbanised Agricultures (goals). “Peculiarities” and “differences” refer to the set of potential and needs expressed by a specific local community. Spaces, agents and activities are three categories used to interpret the metropolitan landscapes in relation to new Urbanised Agricultures. This interpretation is carried on {{in the light of}} “multifunctionality”, which guarantees an overall protection of rural land assumed as a collective good. Multifunctionality can be expressed through complex shapes, able to adapt to various contexts enriching their own specificities; - System devices for new Urbanised Agricultures: green infrastructures (tool). The landscape strategy proposed by the author overcomes spatial, functional and administrative fragmentation of the contemporary city proposing green infrastructures as a “system device”. A green infrastructure can adapt to each territory’s specificities {{as a result of its}} network structure and its mutable structure, and can concentrate a set of very different spaces back to a single, coherent project system (spaces different for protection system, property rights, transformation potential, economic and financial opportunities, capability in providing ecosystem services, etc.); - Social designing for new Urbanised Agricultures (actions). The landscape strategy does not impose any binding role to the project, and identifies the members of a community both as beneficiaries and as producers of their own life context; consequently, the landscape strategy proposes to conduct “Workshops of social designing” as key actions to define new Urbanised Agricultures. Workshops represent the place where an operational dialogue about current relations between rural and urban systems opens by using a project proposal. The goal is to build a network of individuals who share a co-responsibility in the production and management of their landscape, in relation to new job opportunities and new collective benefits (social, cultural and economic benefits, improvements in time organisation, enlarged welfare, etc.). Structure of the research. The research is divided into three parts. Each part pursues “autonomously” a specific purpose but all converge towards the same direction – albeit in different ways – namely the definition of the landscape strategy. - Part I. Modern evolutionary characters of urban/rural relationship (Concepts). The first part of the thesis aims at presenting the latest developments in the urban/rural relationship, by assuming three different points of view: organisation of rural society, urban planning, and town planning legislation. These three thematic interpretations show how city and countryside are two sides of the same evolution, outlining the historical and cultural transformation of fundamental concepts still detectable both in current dynamics (subjects of Part II), both in contemporary designers’ landscape theories (addressed in Part III); - Part II. Contemporary geography of urban/rural relationship (People/tendencies/actions). The second part of the thesis intends to delineate a possible geography of contemporary relationships between cities and countryside. The resulting “map” emerges by the analysis of individuals, spaces and activities related to agricultural practices carried out in urban areas and noticeably relevant for their potential benefits to the city (these practices are already object of several urban policies in the realm of Europe 2020 Strategy). This study tends to demonstrate how the definition of more equitable and sustainable urban paradigms in metropolitan contexts passes through experimenting new forms of local-based multifunctional agriculture; - Part III - Landscapes in progress: interpretations and proposals (critical comparative assessment and project proposal). The third part of the thesis aims to define a Landscape Strategy (goals, tools and actions) to foster new forms of Urbanized Agricultures for supporting local communities in metropolitan areas. A critical analysis of a series of landscape case studies allowed an investigation of the degree of fertility of Pierre Donadieu’s and Richard Ingersoll’s landscape theories. The examination highlights a sequence of elements able to support “potential projects” and which the author reorganised, re-interpreted and conveyed in a strategy for new metropolitan landscapes. This strategy understands a re-balance of <b>urban-rural</b> <b>relations</b> as an opportunity for experimenting initiatives of social innovation...|$|E
40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 - IntroductionNumerous researches {{have shown}} that small urban centers have a significant influence on hinterland rural district and agricultural development; they offer a nearby market for agricultural products, offer job opportunities, provide a center for social services and help in the diffusion of news and information on products and services. Promoting market-oriented development strategies and their emphasis on the export of agricultural products of economic showed that links between agriculture and foreign markets are efficient. Accordingly, the growth of small towns in rural development planning process cannot be ignored. Small cities are competent regions for non-agricultural investment {{in order to reduce}} density and increase costs in big cities. 2 - Theoretical basesIf adequate working conditions can be provided in small towns as well as big cities, these cities can control immigration flows. Development of small cities can be helpful in adsorbing the increasing part of labor that can not to be employed in agriculture section and thus {{plays an important role in}} employment of labors in developing countries. Criteria provided by the UN to recognize the small towns from other urban groups is the number of inhabitants less than 100000 in it, but in every country and regional conditions and requirements with regard to demographic, social and economic, this criterion is different. In the area under the focus of this study, twenty-five thousand population towns were considered as small towns. 3 - DiscussionIn the current study, we have analyzed the relationships between hinterland villages near the city of Ghir and their economical and social development. The geographical positioning of the villages was also taken into consideration. We have used statistical inference model in order to evaluate the indexes. 15 villages and 300 families in Ghir-Karzin Township were chosen as our case study. Numerous fieldtrip were made in order to collect the required data. The methodology used was descriptive-analytical and the choice of indexes was chosen according to the social-economical aspects of rural development. 4 - ConclusionWe have used statistical model in order to determine the correlation between the relations of the villages and Ghir and the social-economical development. Using SPSS software, 16 indicators of quality were assessed by Spearman correlation coefficient and Pearson. Our study shows that for most indexes a correlation exists. Among the economic indicators, two indicators of job satisfaction and stability in relation to their calorie intake has been stable and for other indicators such as income, housing satisfaction, and the capital, household assets, household amenities, agricultural development a significant positive relationship was observed. The status of social indicators also show the relationship between the city and social development indicators; the most meaningful relationship was positive and only for extroversion and social interaction, responsibility and sense of deprivation, no relation was observed. These results indicate that the research literature that has emphasized the positive role and development of small cities is consistent with reality and at the local level. On the other hand, the role of rural relationship with the geographical factors is also assessed. Based on studies conducted, there has been a significant negative relationship between geographical factors such as remoteness and proximity to cities and typology of villages with the degree of connection to the city. In other words, the villages which are located at a closer distance have more relationship with the city and vice versa. In addition, a more careful analysis of the typology of the villages confirms this assumption in that rural mountain villages have less relationship with the City of Ghir. 5 – SuggestionsAccording to the results of this study and confirmation of the positive and developmental role of small towns, we offer the following suggestions:Providing facilities in small towns for rural working population and unemployed can prevent migration of the rural unemployed to the metropolises. Good access to rural services and shopping centers, especially in small towns. Development of local markets emphasizing agricultural products in small towns. Improvement of transport and communications infrastructure between rural areas and small towns. Providing facilities and incentives to encourage private sector investment in small cities to invest in these citiesKeywords: small town, economical-social development, rural-urban relationship.
