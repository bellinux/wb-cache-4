5000|$|The gain of {{the number}} of human breast cancer cell is biologically identic to the rise, in tissues of the genital tract, of the mitotic {{activity}} such as the rodent endometrium. In the 1930s, a new screening test called the <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay</b> was created, {{but it was not until}} 1962 that was firstly normalized by an expert committee. This assay quantifies the addition of uterine wet weight or the intensification of uterotrophic response and, additionally, it measures vaginal cornification. The test estimates a chemical’s ability to evoke biological activities in accord with agonists or antagonists of endogenous estrogens (e.g. 17ß-estradiol); nevertheless, its use for agonists investigation is much more ordinary than for antagonist. The uterus responds to estrogens in two ways: ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{commercial}} laboratory diets have detectable {{levels of}} isoflavones (e. g., phytoestrogens such as genistein [GN]) that have weak estrogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo. During validation {{studies of the}} <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay,</b> diet samples from 20 participating laboratories were collected and analyzed for three major phytoestrogens: GN, daidzein (DN), and coumestrol (CM). Soy phytoestrogens GN and DN were found at total phytoestrogen levels from 100 to 540 µg/g laboratory diet; a forage phytoestrogen, CM, ranged from nondetectable to 4 µg/g laboratory diet. The phytoestrogen levels were compared with both baseline uterine weights of the control groups and with the relative uterine weight increase of groups administered two weak estrogen agonists: bisphenol A (BPA) and nonylphenol (NP). The comparison uses a working assumption of additivity among the phytoestrogens, despite several significant qualifications to this assumption, to estimate total genistein equivalents (TGE). Some evidence was found that phytoestrogen levels in the diet> 325 – 350 µg/g TGE could diminish the responsiveness of the <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay</b> to weak agonists. This was especially true for {{the case of the}} intact, immature female version of the <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay,</b> where higher food consumption relative to body weight leads to higher intakes of dietary phytoestrogens versus ovariectomized adults.

It is formed irreversibly from estrone in the liver {{and to a lesser}} extent in other tissues via 2-hydroxylation mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly the CYP3A and CYP1A subfamilies. 2-OHE1 is the most abundant catechol estrogen in the body.

40|$|The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has {{completed}} phase 2 {{of an international}} validation program for the rodent <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay.</b> The purpose of the validation program was to demonstrate the performance of {{two versions of the}} <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay,</b> the immature female rat and the adult ovariectomized rat, in four standardized protocols. This article reports the dose-response studies of the validation program; the coded single-dose studies are reported in an accompanying paper. The dose-response study design used five selected weak estrogen agonists, bisphenol A, genistein, methoxychlor, nonylphenol, and o,p -DDT. These weak agonists were administered in a prescribed series of doses to measure the performance and reproducibility of the protocols among the participating laboratories. All protocols successfully detected increases in uterine weights when the weak agonists were administered. Within each protocol, there was good agreement and reproducibility of the dose response among laboratories with each substance. Substance-specific variations were observed in the influence of the route of administration on the uterine response, the potency as related to the dose producing the first statistically significant increase in uterine weights, and the maximum increase in uterine weight. Substantive performance differences were not observed between the <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay</b> versions or among the standardized protocols, and these were judged to be qualitatively equivalent. It is noteworthy that these results were reproducible under a variety of different experimental conditions (e. g., animal strain, diet, housing, bedding, vehicle, animal age), indicating that the bioassay's performance as a screen is robust. In conclusion, both the intact, immature, and adult OVX versions, and all protocols appear to be reproducible and transferable across laboratories and are able to detect weak estrogen agonists...|$|E

Positive agonists of the estrogen receptor included the potent reference estrogen 17 -ethinyl estradiol (EE), and the weak estrogen agonists bisphenol A, genistein, methoxychlor, nonylphenol, and o,p -DDT. The negative test substance or nonagonist was n-dibutylphthalate. The test substances were coded, and prescribed doses of each test substance were administered in 16 laboratories. Two versions of the uterotrophic assay, the intact immature and the adult ovariectomized female rat, were tested and compared using four standardized protocols covering both sc and po administration. Assay reproducibility was compared using a) EE doses identical to those used in phase 1 and in parallel dose-response studies, b) single doses of the weak agonists identical to one of five doses from the dose-response studies, and c) a single dose of the negative test substance. The results were reproducible and in agreement both within individual laboratories and across the participating laboratories for the same test substance and protocol. The few exceptions are examined in detail. The reproducibility was achieved despite a variety of different experimental conditions (e. g., variations in animal strain, diet, housing protocol, bedding, vehicle, animal age). In conclusion, both versions of the <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay</b> and all protocols appear robust, reproducible, and transferable across laboratories and able to detect weak estrogen agonists.

40|$|The {{vomeronasal organ}} in rodents is an {{important}} social and sexual signaling pathway. We have investigated whether the housing of intact immature females {{in close proximity to}} mature males would interfere with the sensitivity of the immature rodent <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay</b> as the result of vomeronasal signals transmitted by male urinary proteins. The hypothesis was that the proximity of males might induce early puberty, thereby increasing mean uterine weight and reducing the responsiveness of the assay. The hypothesis was tested in both rats and mice by housing mature males above immature females, separated only by a wire screen, for 3 days and determining possible changes in uterine weight. The results were negative. Neither the mean uterine weight nor the group mean standard deviation of the uterine weights were changed in the <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay.</b> Given that the timing of sexual maturation may vary with the strain of mouse used, we also evaluated the sensitivity of the immature mouse uterotrophic assay to diethylstilbestrol (DES) using four strains of mice. Similar sensitivity was observed for the CD- 1, C 57 Bl 6, and Alpk strains, but B 6 CBF 1 mice were marginally less sensitive to DES than were the other strains. These findings add to earlier data indicating the robustness of the rodent uterotrophic assay protocol.

40|$|The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has {{completed}} {{the first phase}} of an international validation program for the rodent <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay.</b> This <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay</b> is intended to identify the in vivo activity of compounds that are suspected agonists or antagonists of estrogen. This information could, for example, be used to help prioritize positive compounds for further testing. Using draft protocols, we tested and compared two model systems, the immature female rat and the adult ovariectomized rat. Data from 19 participating laboratories using a high-potency reference agonist, ethinyl estradiol (EE), and an antagonist, ZM 189, 154, indicate no substantive performance differences between models. All laboratories and all protocols successfully detected increases in uterine weights using EE in phase 1. These significant uterine weight increases were achieved under a variety of experimental conditions (e. g., strain, diet, housing protocol, bedding, vehicle). For each protocol, there was generally good agreement among laboratories with regard to the actual EE doses both in producing the first significant increase in uterine weights and achieving the maximum uterine response. Furthermore, the Hill equation appears to model the dose response satisfactorily and indicates general agreement based on calculated effective dose (ED) (10) and ED(50) within and among laboratories. The feasibility of an antagonist assay was also successfully demonstrated. Therefore, both models appear robust, reproducible, and transferable across laboratories for high-potency estrogen agonists such as EE. For the next phase of the OECD validation program, both models will be tested against a battery of weak, partial estrogen agonists...|$|E
40|$|The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has {{undertaken}} an international validation {{program for the}} rodent <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay.</b> This validation program comprised two major parts. The first part was {{the development of a}} detailed background review document compiling the existing data on the bioassay’s history, the molecular and physiologic basis for the bioassay’s mechanistic relevance to detect estrogen agonists and antagonists, a review of important bioassay protocol parameters, and a review of the data generated by in vitro assays, previous uterotrophic bioassays, and developmental and reproductive assays to assess and support the overall predictivity of the <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay.</b> The second part was an extensive multiyear effort managed by a validation management group to demonstrate the operating characteristics of four protocols. The effort was conducted in two phases. The phase 1 results with the reference agonist ethinyl estradiol (EE) and antagonist ZM 189, 154 has been published previously. This Environmental Health Perspectives mini-monograph is devoted to the phase 2 work using five weak estrogen agonists, bisphenol A, genistein, methoxychlor, nonylphenol, and o,p´-DDT, as well as the negative substance dibutylphthalate. These data show that all protocols successfully detected increases in uterine weights when a sufficient dose level of the weak agonists was administered, whether the substances were known or provided as coded doses to the laboratory. The data with both the reference EE and all five weak agonists are reproducible over time and under a variety of different experimental conditions (e. g., animal strain, diet, housing, bedding, vehicle, animal age). In conclusion, all protocols now have sufficient data to support their validity. Key words: endocrine disruption, estrogen, rat uterus, uterotrophic, validation.

40|$|Bac k g r o u n d: Cadmium (Cd), a {{ubiquitous}} food contaminant, {{has been}} proposed to be an endocrine disruptor by inducing estrogenic responses in vivo. Several in vitro studies suggested that these effects are mediated via estrogen receptors (ERs). Objective: We performed this study to clarify whether Cd-induced effects in vivo are mediated via classical ER signaling through estrogen responsive element (ERE) -regulated genes or if other signaling pathways are involved. Met h o d s: We investigated the estrogenic effects of cadmium chloride (CdCl 2) exposure in vivo by applying the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) rodent <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay</b> to transgenic ERE-luciferase reporter mice. Immature female mice were injected subcutaneously with CdCl 2 (5, 50, or 500 µg/kg body weight) or with 17 α-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) on 3 consecutive days. We examined uterine weight and histology, vaginal opening, body and organ weights, Cd tissue retention, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and ERE-dependent luciferase expression. Re s u l t s: CdCl 2 increased {{the height of the}} uterine luminal epithelium in a dose-dependent manner without increasing the uterine wet weight, altering the timing of vaginal opening, or affecting th...|$|E

40|$|Morinda citrifolia (Noni) {{appears to}} restore normal menstrual cycle and {{alleviate}} menstrual symptoms; however, its estrogenic activity {{has not been}} tested in vivo. The present study tested whether the beneficial effects of Morinda citrifolia extract are mediated through estrogenic properties. <b>Uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay</b> were done on tissue from prepubertal mice that were subcutaneaous treated with the substance for 3 days at various doses in water and alcohol vehicle and compared to mice treated for the same time with doses of 17 -β estradiol. The frequency of vaginal opening and vaginal cornification in mice receiving Morinda citrifolia was not different from control mice. The relative wet and blotted uterine weight of mice receiving low doses but not higher doses of Morinda citrifolia {{was significantly higher than}} control group. The relative estrogenic potency of alcohol and water extracts of Morinda citrifolia was 1 : 1, 000 and 1 : 10, 000 respectively, indicating that the estrogenic activity in Morinda citrifolia is only seen at low doses, and even then it has very low potency in comparison to estradiol.

The potential for appreciable exposure of humans to such substances prompts {{the need to develop}} sensitive screening methods to quantitate and evaluate the risk to the public. Yeast cells transformed with plasmids encoding the human estrogen receptor and an estrogen responsive promoter linked to a reporter gene were evaluated for screening compounds for estrogenic activity. Relative sensitivity to estrogens was evaluated by reference to 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) calibration curves derived using the recombinant yeast cells, MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells, and a prepubertal mouse <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay.</b> The recombinant yeast cell bioassay (RCBA) was approximately two and five orders of magnitude more sensitive to E 2 than MCF- 7 cells and the uterotrophic assay, respectively. The estrogenic potency of 53 chemicals, including steroid hormones, synthetic estrogens, environmental pollutants, and phytoestrogens, was measured using the RCBA. Potency values produced with the RCBA relative to E 2 (100) included estrone (9. 6), diethylstilbestrol (74. 3), tamoxifen (0. 0047), alpha-zearalanol (1. 3), equol (0. 085), 4 -nonylphenol (0. 005), and butylbenzyl phathalate (0. 0004), which were similar to literature values but generally higher than those produced by the uterotrophic assay. Exquisite sensitivity, absence of test compound biotransformation, ease of use, and the possibility of measuring antiestrogenic activity are important attributes that argue for the suitability of the RCBA in screening for potential xenoestrogens to evaluate risk to humans, wildlife, and the environment...|$|E
40|$|The estrogenic {{potential}} of lavender oil was evaluated in a percutaneous <b>uterotrophic</b> <b>bioassay</b> in immature female rats. Four groups of 10 immature female rats each {{were randomly selected}} on postpartum day (PPD) 16. During the 3 -day treatment period (PPDs 19 - 21), the immature rats were separated from the dams, caged in groups of 5 in a litter box for 6 hours, and administered the vehicle control article (corn oil) or lavender oil at 20 or 100 mg/kg per day. All dosages were administered as a 5 mL/kg volume in a Hilltop Chamber (25 mm diameter; absorbent material removed) placed on the shaved back of each immature rat, and secured with micropore tape and Vetrap. A positive control group was gavaged twice daily with 2. 5 mg/kg per day of 17 a-ethinyl estradiol. Daily observations included viability, clinical signs, body weights, and body weight gains. All rats were euthanized 24 hours after {{the third and final}} treatment, the uteri and ovaries were removed, and the paired ovaries and wet and blotted uterine weights were recorded. No unscheduled deaths occurred. No skin reactions were observed. Both dosages of lavender oil significantly reduced body weight gains after the third day of treatment, but terminal body weights and mean absolute and relative uterine weights did not differ significantly from vehicle control values. Positive controls showed significant increases in body weight and increased mean absolute and relative uterine weights as expected. Based on these data, lavender oil, at dosages of 20 or 100 mg/kg, was not active in the rat uterotrophic assay and gave no evidence of estrogenic activity...|$|E
