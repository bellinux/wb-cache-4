40|$|Highly <b>pure,</b> <b>ultra</b> {{long and}} uniform-sized {{semiconductor}} nanowires in bulk-quantity have been synthesized by novel methods of laser ablation and thermal evaporation of semiconductor powders mixed with metal or oxide catalysts. Transmission electron microscopic {{study shows that}} decomposition of semiconductor sub-oxides and the defect structure {{play an important role}} in enhancing the formation and growth of high-quality semiconductor nanowires. The morphology, microstructure, optical and electrical properties of the nanowires have been characterized systematically by Raman scattering, photoluminescence and field emission. A new growth mechanism, namely oxide-assisted growth, is proposed based on the microstructure and different morphologies of the nanowires observed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S. A.

We employed the Procedure for <b>Ultra</b> Rapid Extraction (<b>PURE)</b> kit to isolate mycobacterial DNA and found that the highest sensitivity limit with a minimum total cell count of mycobacterium (including DNA purification with PURE) was up to 1 × 10 (3) cells/reaction, based on color changes under natural light with FDA reagents. The detection limit of this procedure when applied to artificial serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples was also about 1 × 10 (3) cells/reaction. Therefore, this substitute method using conventional culture or clinical specimens followed by LAMP combined with PURE could be a powerful tool to enable the rapid identification of M. bovis BCG as point-of-care testing. It is suitable for practical use not only in resource-limited situations, but also in any clinical situation involving immunocompromised patients because of its convenience, rapidity, and cost effectiveness...|$|R

50|$|The beach, {{which was}} {{originally}} <b>ultra</b> <b>pure</b> fine white sand has been degraded by coarser sand washed ashore during attempts {{to reclaim the}} beach further north at Aspendale in the late 1970s. This reclamation involved pumping sand onto the eroding beach from far offshore. Unfortunately this off shore sand was much coarser and yellower being harder and grittier. It's clear today to see the progressive spread of this course sand now 3 km south of its original location. Other changes to the beach include the installation of sewerage to beach front properties in the 1960s when the entire dune was bulldozed, removing all native vegetation and razing {{what was once a}} protective mound. Introduced grasses were planted to hold the sand together and this eventually spread down to near the waters edge, producing what is seen today as a creeping sand dune covering the original beach with grass.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, {{at the age}} of 37, Pasechnik {{was invited}} by a general from the Soviet Ministry of Defence to start his own {{biotechnology}} institute in Leningrad and he was given “an unlimited budget” to buy equipment in the West and recruit the best staff available. The laboratory he created was in reality part of the countrywide Biopreparat program. Known as the Institute of <b>Ultra</b> <b>Pure</b> Biochemical Preparations, it was to work on a strain of plague. The laboratory actually began operating in 1981, and {{over the next two years}} Pasechnik realized that, far from running a civilian research operation dedicated to vaccine development, as he had been promised, he had become part of a vast network of laboratories and factories involved in a massive BW program.According to Pasechnik, the Institute, which had a staff of about 400, did research on modifying cruise missiles to spread the plague. The weapons system was to operate by flying low to avoid early-warning systems and use robot craft to spray clouds of aerosolized pathogens over unsuspecting enemies. The team succeeded in producing an aerosolized version of the plague microbe that could survive outside a lab. This version of the organism was genetically-engineered to be resistant to antibiotics.|$|E

40|$|Case StudySilicon carbide (SiC) {{is known}} for its {{superior}} abrasion resistance, and is widely used in pumps as a material for water-lubricated sliding bearings. <b>Ultra</b> <b>pure</b> water (UPW), with a specific resistance of greater than 10 M?/cm, is often used for purposes such as washing water in semiconductor manufacturing processes and recirculation water in nuclear power generation plants. However, in cases where SiC sliding bearings are lubricated with <b>ultra</b> <b>pure</b> water, abnormal wear is occasionally found. Such a problem is not seen with normal water lubrication. The abnormal wear when lubricated with UPW is caused by oxidation of the SiC surface and generation of silicon dioxide. Diamond is the hardest material in the world, and are expected to provide effective abrasion resistance. Polycrystalline diamond film is harder than SiC and can be formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). There are various potential applications for this material, including sliding bearings.
