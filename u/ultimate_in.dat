500|$|A {{fighting}} game sequel, Persona 4 Arena, {{known in}} Japan as Persona 4: The <b>Ultimate</b> <b>in</b> Mayonaka Arena, {{was developed by}} Arc System Works, the company known for creating the Guilty Gear and BlazBlue series, and released in 2012 for arcades, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

500|$|Considerable {{work was}} needed to fully develop the design but, by early 1933, {{the two men had}} moved the project through the pre-project, basic {{aerodynamic}} and evaluation stages, including the building of a wooden scale model that Ilić took to Paris to test in the Eiffel-built wind tunnel. Up to this point, the two men had received no outside help, and had been forced to borrow from family to keep the project going. They then decided to approach the head of the technical department of the VVKJ, Potpukovnik (Lieutenant Colonel) Srbobran Stanojević with their design. Stanojević was surprised but impressed with their work and an official report proposing to build the design was presented on 22 September 1933. Some senior VVKJ officers opposed the concept, as did Kapetan (Captain) Leonid Bajdak, an [...] "acknowledged outstanding exponent of fighter tactics", who considered that a biplane with a [...] engine was the <b>ultimate</b> <b>in</b> fighter design.|$|E
500|$|The {{class in}} both {{as-built}} and modified forms has {{been subject to}} a range of divergent opinions. The utilisation of welded steel construction and the various innovations that had not previously been seen in British locomotive design meant that the class earned Bulleid the title [...] "Last Giant of Steam". The constant concern for ease of maintenance and utility had not previously been seen on locomotives of older design, whilst their highly efficient boilers represented the <b>ultimate</b> <b>in</b> British steam technology, the hallmark of a successful locomotive design. Despite this, the number of innovations introduced at the same time made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain during {{the first few years of}} service. Many of these difficulties were overcome during the rebuilding, leading to D.L. Bradley's statement that the modified locomotives were [...] "the finest express locomotives to work in the country". Overall, the class was largely successful, with half of the locomotives completing more than 1 million miles in revenue-earning service.|$|E

500|$|The {{titles of}} games {{have also been}} altered. The banner title for Persona was changed from Megami Ibunroku to Revelations, principally because the team thought the latter title sounded [...] "cool". The Revelations title was removed for Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment. After the {{successful}} release of Nocturne, the [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] moniker {{was added to the}} series title to help with Western marketing. This has not been the case for some titles: Persona 4 Arenas original title, Persona 4: The <b>Ultimate</b> <b>in</b> Mayonaka Arena, was shortened as it sounded awkward, and the [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] moniker was dropped as it would have made the title too long. The same change was made for Persona 4 Golden, with the team also dropping [...] "The" [...] that was in the Japanese title because it would have looked and sounded odd in Western territories. Persona 5 was also released in the West without the moniker.|$|E
500|$|Rachel Brodsky of Spin {{remarked that}} both [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] and [...] "Frozen" [...] {{were able to}} [...] "cement the {{mainstream}} crossover of a dance culture once relegated to illegal basement parties". Elysa Gardner of the Los Angeles Times perceived that [...] "Madonna's enduring knack for incorporating hip and exotic textures into accessible pop tunes is evident on avant-leaning dance tracks such as 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-bye'." [...] Charlotte Robinson of PopMatters praised {{the inclusion of the}} recording and other Orbit tracks on Madonna's 2001 compilation album, GHV2, for representing [...] "a testament to [...] ability to use gadgets and electronic wizardry not to alienate listeners, but to draw them in". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave an A– grade to the song for its composition, writing that it was [...] "tructured like your average adult contemporary ballad with enough electronic sheen to sound edgy, 'The Power of Goodbye' was the <b>ultimate</b> <b>in</b> electronica-lite." ...|$|E

Other Tribune writers have described the station as an [...] "oasis for the urban cyclist" [...] and reminiscent of [...] "a hip health club". [...] The Toronto Star described it similarly, saying that it is a [...] "jewel-like glass building" [...] with [...] "amenities of an upscale health club"; it quoted a cycling advocate who said [...] "It's not heaven, but it's close". [...] According to The Plain Dealer, the Cycle Center is the United States' [...] "best-known [...] station", while The Oregonian describes it as [...] "the <b>ultimate</b> <b>in</b> bicycle stations". The Boston Globe felt that the Cycle Center put Chicago over the top as the nation's most cycling-friendly city.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Rhino Records issued <b>Ultimate!</b> <b>in</b> July in the US and in August in the UK as a two-CD boxed set. [...] Dan Forte of Vintage Guitar {{magazine}} called it [...] "the closest-to-definitive collection {{of a band}} that’s been woefully under-represented on CD". [...] The Austin Chronicle's Raoul Hernandez described the album as [...] "lend ample credence to the supposition that the Yardbirds are the not-so-missing musical link between Sixties pop and Seventies rock". [...] However, {{he points out that}} the Mickie Most-produced tracks with Page [...] "flounder", making the collection less of a concise statement. [...] Similarly, while Richie Unterberger gave it AllMusic's five star rating, he questioned the inclusion of some of the more obscure material. [...] He felt that the early demos, the Italian-language single, and the Keith Relf solo numbers detract from [...] "the overall tone of a set largely {{selected on the basis of}} quality, rather than collectability". [...] Forte notes that more songs from Five Live Yardbirds and two strong Page-era songs, [...] "Glimpses" [...] and [...] "Smile on Me", were not included.|$|E
500|$|The {{family moved}} to Moscow in spring 1943. At {{the time of the}} Eighth Symphony's premiere, the tide had turned for the Red Army. As a consequence, the public, and most {{importantly}} the authorities, wanted another triumphant piece from the composer. Instead, they got the Eighth Symphony, perhaps the <b>ultimate</b> <b>in</b> sombre and violent expression within Shostakovich's output. In order to preserve the image of Shostakovich (a vital bridge {{to the people of the}} Union and to the West), the government assigned the name [...] "Stalingrad" [...] to the symphony, giving it the appearance of a mourning of the dead in the bloody Battle of Stalingrad. However, the symphony did not escape criticism. Its composer is reported to have said: [...] "When the Eighth was performed, it was openly declared counter-revolutionary and anti-Soviet. They said, 'Why did Shostakovich write an optimistic symphony at the beginning of the war and a tragic one now? At the beginning we were retreating and now we're attacking, destroying the Fascists. And Shostakovich is acting tragic, that means he's on the side of the fascists.'" [...] The work was unofficially but effectively banned until 1956.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time Shakira's album evoked sharp {{criticism}} {{by a number of}} authors. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, for instance, called the album a [...] "the <b>ultimate</b> <b>in</b> crossover nightmares" [...] and opined that Shakira's incorporation of different musical genres made it sound confusing, saying [...] "Its wan ska-pop, faux-country ballads, and generic rock barely betray a Spanish accent or any musical heritage. (She can't decide if she wants to sound like Alanis or Shania)". Matt Cibula from PopMatters gave a more mixed view in his review of Laundry Service; he complimented some of the lyrics of the songs but expressed disappointment in Shakira's production of the album, writing it off as [...] "generic". He felt that the album was [...] "extremely safe" [...] and speculated that the reason behind the album's [...] "generic" [...] sound was due to the Estefans' involvement, saying [...] "when I read that she's [...] helping you with lyrics and he's [...] 'executive producer', and I hear the unmistakable hum of 'moneymoneymoneymoney' in the background [...]" [...] Ernesto Lechner from Rolling Stone complimented the singer's voice as a [...] "wild and beautiful instrument [...] capable of delivering scorching moments of musical passion," [...] but commented that the involvement of a [...] "battalion of producers and songwriters" [...] led to Shakira sounding [...] "downright silly" [...] on Laundry Service and also criticised [...] "her efforts to spice things up with obvious touches of Latin American folklore." ...|$|E
