5|$|On 19 February 2007, a free {{downloadable}} pack {{was made}} available for the game. The pack includes four new playable male agents, three of whom have unique, <b>upgradable</b> headgear. A free update was released on 11 May 2007, which allows the player to reset gangs, {{makes it easier to}} find orbs, improves stunt ring visibility, enhances targeting and camera angles when driving, and provides several other minor fixes. This update also includes a new ground strike attack.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored 2 is an action-adventure stealth {{game played}} from a first-person perspective. After playing as Empress Emily Kaldwin during the prologue, players {{may decide to}} play either as Emily or as Corvo Attano (the protagonist from the {{previous}} game). Side missions unlock alternate methods of assassination, non-lethal approaches and paths to navigate the main mission. Both characters wield swords, pistols, crossbows, a retractable blade, grenades and mines—all of which are <b>upgradable.</b> Upgrades may be purchased at black market shops found throughout the levels, and blueprints scattered across levels unlock new potential upgrades. Coin is required to buy these upgrades, which again may be found throughout a level or gained from other collectibles, like stealing paintings. Players can choose whether to play stealthily or not, and can finish the game without taking a life. Health elixirs and food consumables will restore health, while mana elixirs replenish mana.|$|E
25|$|At the University of Dublin the {{preclinical}} course {{leads to}} an additional Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree (<b>upgradable</b> after {{three or four years}} to Master of Arts); as originally after this most students used to go elsewhere to complete clinical training.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{systems are}} built up using design {{principles}} from the Open Telecom Platform {{which leads to}} more code <b>upgradable</b> designs. Successful hot code loading is a tricky subject; Code needs to be written with care {{to make use of}} Erlang's facilities.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Tesla {{introduced}} a 70kWh battery {{to replace the}} existing 60kWh batteries and base 60kWh Model S vehicles, as the 60 was low margin and not sufficiently welcomed by customers. All 70kWh cars can be had with rear-wheel drive or all wheel drive. The 60 was re-introduced in 2016 as a software-limited 75, <b>upgradable</b> to 75.|$|E
25|$|At the {{universities}} of Oxford and Cambridge, the preclinical course {{leads to an}} additional Bachelor of Arts (BA), degree (<b>upgradable</b> after {{three or four years}} to Master of Arts), after which most students used to go elsewhere (but usually to one of the London teaching hospitals) to complete clinical training. They could then take the degrees of their new university: They used to have the options of returning to their old university to take the clinical examinations or taking one of the old non-university qualifying examinations. Most students at Oxford and Cambridge now remain in place to take their clinical training.|$|E
25|$|The F-15K variant {{has several}} {{features}} not typically found on F-15Es, {{such as an}} AAS-42 Infra-red search and track, a customized Tactical Electronics Warfare Suite to reduce weight and increase jamming effectiveness, cockpit compatibility with night vision devices, ARC-232 U/VHF radio with Fighter Data Link system, and advanced APG-63(V)1 mechanical-scanned array radar. The APG-63(V)1 radar has common digital processing equipment with the APG-63(V)3 AESA radar, and thus is <b>upgradable</b> to an AESA radar via antenna replacement. The F-15K is equipped with the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System and weapons such as AGM-84K SLAM-ER, AGM-84H Harpoon Block II, KEPD 350.|$|E
25|$|The {{operating}} {{system is not}} located in the Pippin's onboard storage, and is instead located on the CD-ROMs {{for each of the}} Pippin's software releases. Apple could thus upgrade the {{operating system}} without having to sell new hardware to the consumer. However, because of this, once Pippin software releases ended, it became impossible to upgrade to a later operating system, or install extensions and such. The system automatically reboots whenever the CD-ROM eject button is pushed, so a user can not load the system software off one CD-ROM, and then insert another CD-ROM. Apple intended for the Pippin platform to be an appliance, and encouraged consumers to purchase a fully featured Macintosh system if they were looking for something <b>upgradable.</b> Bandai never upgraded its system software beyond the 7.5.2 version. Hardware enthusiasts have been able to run system software as late as Mac OS 8.0, but this can only be done on a system utilizing a developer ROM-BIOS.|$|E
25|$|A {{new model}} of the Mac Mini was {{introduced}} on June 15, 2010. The new model was thinner, with a unibody aluminum case designed to be easily opened for RAM access, and incorporated upgraded hardware, such as an HDMI port and Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics. An update announced July 20, 2011 dropped the internal CD/DVD optical drive from all versions and introduced a Thunderbolt port, Intel Core i5 processor, and either Intel HD Graphics 3000 integrated graphics or AMD Radeon HD 6630M dedicated graphics. The server model was upgraded to a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor. Quad-core i7 CPUs are also used in the late-2012 desktop Mac Mini computers. It got a much anticipated refresh after long two years in October 2014, bringing Haswell CPUs, better graphics, $100 lower price for the base model, while the metal body remained nearly the same. The only change was {{the removal of the}} two holes used to open the case, as the RAM is no longer <b>upgradable</b> because it's now soldered to the logic board; this idea is similar to the Retina MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air and the Mid 2014 21.5-inch iMac.|$|E
500|$|The iPad 2 {{also adds}} the {{capability}} to support GarageBand, iMovie, and the iWork apps Pages, Keynote, and Numbers. These applications do not come with the iPad but are instead official applications from Apple sold within the App Store. On March 7, 2012, after the unveiling of the third generation iPad, the firmware of the iPad 2 was <b>upgradable</b> to iOS 5.1. Scott Rohde, a senior Sony executive described the iPad as [...] "a game console disguised as a device that can be appropriated in the business workplace." ...|$|E
500|$|In late March 2011, the iPad 2 was {{released}} alongside iOS 4.2.1, which primarily introduced FaceTime, Personal Hotspots and AirPlay support among other features. The iPad 2 {{is compatible with}} iOS 4.3, which introduced Airplay Mirroring and Home Sharing among other features. On October 12, 2011, upon {{the release of the}} iPhone 4S, the iPad was <b>upgradable</b> to the iOS 5 firmware which brought over 200 new user features to iOS compatible devices including Notification Center, iMessage, Reminders, and an updated notifications system, using a new [...] "banner" [...] style instead of the previously used pop-up [...] "alert" [...] style.|$|E
500|$|The Retina models {{also have}} fewer user-accessible upgrade or {{replacement}} options than previous MacBooks. Unlike in previous generations, the memory is soldered onto the logic board {{and is therefore}} not <b>upgradable.</b> The solid state drive is not soldered and can be replaced by users. The battery is glued into place; attempts to remove it may destroy the battery and/or trackpad. The entire case uses proprietary pentalobe screws and cannot be disassembled with standard tools. While the battery is glued in, recycling companies have stated that the design is only [...] "mildly inconvenient" [...] and does not hamper the recycling process.|$|E
500|$|The player plays Vergil {{through all}} game's missions. He retain his {{moves from the}} Special Edition of Devil May Cry 3, {{including}} the close ranged weapon switches, but also added with elements from the reboot of the franchise [...] It is known that his moves are also fully <b>upgradable.</b> And a feature was added for his choice of stylized fighting, which {{is known as the}} [...] "Concentration" [...] mechanic. While in action, Vergil's abilities and moves will grow stronger and faster the more calmly and flawlessly he fights. The Concentration mechanic is signaled by a blue gauge in the upper left corner of the screen which is Vergil's Concentration Gauge. It has three levels. The higher the level, the more powerful attacks {{he will be able to}} perform. To increase the gauge, Vergil can land attacks on enemies and dodge their attacks, but if he is hit by an enemy or if he runs, these cause the gauge to deplete. Missing attacks also depletes the gauge, so the player must be efficient with their attacks during battle.|$|E
2500|$|... iFP-100 series: (32MB, 64MB, 128MB, 256MB, 512MB) Prism shaped. USB 1.1 {{connectivity}} (four-pin mini-B plug). Plays MP3, WMA and WAV files. Prism shaped. MTP (UMS <b>upgradable).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Archos {{announced}} in 2011 {{that it would}} release a $199 Honeycomb tablet. The G9 tablets are powered by the TI OMAP4 series of SOC, using the 4430 and 4460 variants at 1GHz, 1.2GHz, or 1.5GHz and are equipped with either 512MB or 1GB RAM. [...] They have 8GB or 16GB of flash memory, and a microSDHC slot or a 250GB hard drive. The earliest releases of these tablets utilized Android 3.0 and are <b>upgradable</b> to Android 4.0.3. [...] All have official access to Google Play. Connectivity includes WiFi (802.11 b/g/n), Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR, and GPS and are <b>upgradable</b> to 3G using an Archos G9 3G stick.|$|E
2500|$|On July 27, 2010, Apple updated {{its line}} of iMacs to feature the new Intel Core [...] "i-series" [...] {{processors}} across the line. The 21.5" [...] models now feature the Core i3 processor, {{but these are}} <b>upgradable</b> to the Core i5. The high end 27" [...] features a Quad-Core i5 processor, which is <b>upgradable</b> to a Quad-Core i7. On this date Apple also announced its new [...] "Apple Magic Trackpad" [...] peripheral, a trackpad {{similar to that of}} MacBook Pro for use with iMac or any other Apple computer. Apple also introduced a AA NiMH battery charger intended to simplify the use of batteries in these peripherals. Apple offers an option to use a solid state drive instead of a large mechanical drive.|$|E
2500|$|Analog {{computing}} {{devices are}} fast, digital computing devices are more versatile and accurate, {{so the idea}} is to combine the two processes for the best efficiency. An example of such hybrid elementary device is the hybrid multiplier where one input is an analog signal, the other input is a digital signal [...] and the output is analog. It acts as an analog potentiometer <b>upgradable</b> digitally. [...] This kind of hybrid technique is mainly used for fast dedicated real time computation when computing time is very critical as signal processing for radars and generally for controllers in embedded systems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{changes were}} {{designed}} to be <b>upgradable</b> without major changes to the deployed system – the TTR/MTR could be replaced at any time, the HIPAR used its own displays and therefore required no changes in the missile launch equipment, the TRR was slaved to the TTR and simply updated range readings, and the new seeker could be retrofitted at any time. The original Ajax detection radar retroactively became known as LOPAR, and remained in use as the main target selection radar in the missile control van. HIPAR would detect targets separately and [...] "hand off" [...] to the LOPAR and TTR so those systems could remain largely unchanged and able to launch either Hercules or Ajax.|$|E
2500|$|Black Ops {{retains the}} {{experience}} points and unlockable reward {{system that has}} been kept since Call of Duty 4. The game's multiplayer focuses on socialization and customization. [...] "Create-a-Class 2.0" [...] allows enhanced personalization with appearance items as well as <b>upgradable</b> perks; weapons are extensively customizable with writing, emblems, attachments and camouflage painting. Even reticles can be modified. There are more than one style for an attachment, which allows for a lot more personalized weaponry; for example, the player can choose between a red dot sight or a reflex sight, both of which share {{many of the same}} traits, although the red dot fills up less of the screen (something desired by many players). Character models depend on the first tier perk instead of the weapon's type. Furthermore, face paints can be unlocked. New custom killstreak rewards include explosive R/C cars, guided missiles and controllable attack helicopters.|$|E
2500|$|A fire-support version using a CMI Defence's CSE-90 turret {{with the}} Cockerill 90mm Mk III was first {{unveiled}} at Indo Defence & Aerospace 2008, which {{was announced that}} the APS-3 fire-support version would be deployed into the Indonesian Army by 2010. The final, definitive version of the fire support variant was unveiled at [...] Indo Defence & Aerospace 2014 as the Badak. The Badak featured a new all-welded monocoque steel hull with STANAG 4569 Level 3 protection, a new 340hp power pack located front left and the driver seated towards the front on the right side, leaving {{the remainder of the}} hull clear for the installation of the turret. The suspension also utilizes double wishbone independent suspension (as opposed to torsion bar on the Anoa) for better stability while firing the 90mm canon. The CMI Defence CSE 90LP two-person turret has a baseline protection of up to STANAG 4569 Level 1 (<b>upgradable</b> to Level 4) and is armed with a 90mm low-pressure rifled gun. In addition, there is a 7.62mm co-axial machine gun, with another 7.62mm machine gun mounted {{on the left side of}} the turret roof for use in the self-defence and air defence roles, plus banks of 76mm grenade launchers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{technological}} singularity (also, simply, the singularity) is {{the hypothesis}} that the invention of artificial superintelligence will abruptly trigger runaway technological growth, resulting in unfathomable changes to human civilization. According to this hypothesis, an <b>upgradable</b> intelligent agent (such as a computer running software-based artificial general intelligence) would enter a [...] "runaway reaction" [...] of self-improvement cycles, with each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an intelligence explosion and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that would, qualitatively, far surpass all human intelligence. John von Neumann first used the term [...] "singularity" [...] (c. 1950s), in the context of technological progress causing accelerating change: [...] "The accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, give the appearance of approaching some essential singularity {{in the history of the}} race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint. I. J. Good's [...] "intelligence explosion" [...] model predicts that a future superintelligence will trigger a singularity. Emeritus professor of computer science at San Diego State University and science fiction author Vernor Vinge said in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity that this would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate.|$|E
2500|$|The 2006 and 2007 Mac Mini {{models that}} come {{standard}} with a 32-bit Intel Core Solo processor {{can be changed}} to an Intel 64-bit Core 2 Duo processor through a simple upgrade. Since the 2006 and 2007 [...] "Merom"-based Mac Mini models came with socketed processors, the 32-bit processor can easily be removed, and replaced with a compatible 64-bit Intel Core 2 Duo processor. The following processors are compatible: 2.00GHz Intel T7200 SL9SF, 2.16GHz Intel T7400 SL9SE, 2.33GHz Intel T7600 SL9SD. The more recent 2009 and later Mac Mini models have the processors soldered onto the logic board and thus are not <b>upgradable.</b> Once the 2006 Mac Mini has been upgraded to a 64-bit Core 2 Duo processor, and RAM is upgraded to at least 2 GB, it can run OS X Lion through a minor modification by editing or deleting the platformsupport.plist file. A 2007 Mac Mini will run OS X Lion without any modification. Many users have found that such upgrades can make the 2006/2007 Mac Mini models performance even better than the 2009 Mac Mini models. Geekbench scores {{have shown that the}} 2.33GHz Core 2 Duo fitted Mac Mini with 2 GB of RAM has a score of 3060 whereas a late 2009 Mac Mini with 2 GB of RAM has 3056 making the two machines fairly comparable.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. Navy {{released}} the long-delayed RFP for the UCLASS on 17 April 2014, after Navy Secretary Ray Mabus signed the draft the previous day. The draft RFP was {{planned to be}} released in mid-2013, but was repeatedly delayed by disagreements over the proposed aircraft's stealth levels, ability to survive in contested airspace, and in-flight refueling ability. [...] Though classified, available details showed original UCLASS specifications of continuously providing two ISR orbits at range over uncontested airspace with a light strike capability to eliminate targets of opportunity. [...] The airframe would also have an open architecture design to be easily <b>upgradable.</b> The Navy was pursuing a path to at first use the UCLASS as a reconnaissance asset with proven standoff sensor technologies to observe targets in uncontested international airspace, while building in excess weight, space, and power capacity to add sensors and weapons and modify it later for use in contested airspace if needed. In July 2014, JROC launched a review of the UCLASS program in response to congressional criticism that Navy requirements were too narrowly focused to meet future mission threats. [...] Although the Navy planned to weaponize the UCLASS incrementally, stealth and payload are things that must be built into an airframe and cannot be engineered in at a later time. With the requirements again being reviewed, the planned release of the RFP in late July was suspended until {{the creation of a new}} joint Capabilities Development Document (CDD).|$|E
2500|$|In September 2012 at the Tokyo Game Show, Sony {{announced}} that a new, slimmer PS3 redesign (CECH-4000) was due for release in late 2012 {{and that it would}} be available with either a 250GB or 500GB hard drive. Three versions of the Super Slim model were revealed: one with a 500GB hard drive, a second with a 250GB hard drive which is not available in PAL regions, and a third with a 12GB flash storage that was available in PAL regions, and in Canada. The storage of 12GB model is <b>upgradable</b> with an official standalone 250GB hard drive. A vertical stand was also released for the model. In the United Kingdom, the 500GB model was released on September 28, 2012; and the 12GB model was released on October 12, 2012. In the United States, the PS3 Super Slim was first released as a bundled console. The 250GB model was bundled with the Game of the Year edition of [...] and released on September 25, 2012; and the 500GB model was bundled with Assassin's Creed III and released on October 30, 2012. In Japan, the black colored Super Slim model was released on October 4, 2012; and the white colored Super Slim model was released on November 22, 2012. The Super Slim model is 20 percent smaller and 25 percent lighter than the Slim model and features a manual sliding disc cover instead of a motorized slot-loading disc cover of the Slim model. The white colored Super Slim model was released in the United States on January 27, 2013 as part of the Instant Game Collection Bundle. The Garnet Red and Azurite Blue colored models were launched in Japan on February 28, 2013. The Garnet Red version was released in North America on March 12, 2013 as part of the [...] bundle with 500 GB storage and contained God of War: Ascension as well as the God of War Saga. The Azurite Blue model was released as a GameStop exclusive with 250GB storage.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs {{stated that}} because [...] "customization really is mostly {{software}} now ... {{most of the}} options in other computers are in Mac", unlike the Apple II the Macintosh 128K did not need slots, which he described as costly and requiring larger size and more power. It was not <b>upgradable</b> by the user and only Apple service centers were permitted to open the case. All accessories were external, such as the MacCharlie that added IBM PC compatibility. There was no provision for adding internal storage, more RAM or any upgrade cards, however some of the Macintosh engineers objected to Jobs's ideas and secretly developed workarounds for them. As an example, the Macintosh {{was supposed to have}} only 17 address lines on the motherboard, enough to support 128k of system RAM, but the design team added an additional two address lines without Jobs's knowledge, making it possible to expand the computer to 512k, although the actual act of upgrading system RAM was difficult and required piggybacking additional RAM chips overtop the onboard 4164 chips. In September 1984, after months of complaints over the Mac's inadequate RAM, Apple released an official 512k machine. Although this had always been planned from the beginning, Steve Jobs maintained if the user desired more RAM than the Mac 128 provided, he should simply pay extra money for a Mac 512 rather than upgrade the computer himself. When the Mac 512 was released, Apple rebranded the original model as [...] "Macintosh 128k" [...] and modified the motherboard to allow easier RAM upgrades. Improving on the hard-wired RAM thus required a motherboard replacement (which was priced similarly to a new computer), or a third-party chip replacement upgrade, which was not only expensive but would void Apple's warranty. The difficulty of fitting software into its limited free memory, coupled with the new interface and event driven programming model, discouraged software vendors from supporting it, leaving the 128K with a relatively small software library. Whereas the Macintosh Plus, {{and to a lesser extent}} the Macintosh 512K, are compatible with much later software, the 128K is limited to specially crafted programs. A stock Mac 128K with the original 64K ROM is neither compatible with Apple's external 800 KB drive with HFS nor with Apple's Hard Disk 20. A Mac 128K that has been upgraded with the newer 128K ROM (called a Macintosh 128Ke) can use internal and external 800 KB drives with HFS, as well as the HD20. Both can print on an AppleShare network, but neither can do file sharing because of their limited RAM.|$|E
