25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{regard the}} Gospel of Thomas {{as part of}} the tradition from which the canonical gospels eventually emerged; however, the Gospel of Thomas is heavily gnostic and likely not written by orthodox Christians. In any case both of these documents are important as showing <b>us</b> <b>what</b> the theoretical Q document might have looked like.|$|E
25|$|The Poles' {{resistance}} in Warsaw is a Jewish resistance. Only yids {{are capable of}} the blackmail of putting {{women and children in}} the front line, {{to take advantage of the}} Germans' sense of scruple. The Germans have no interest in the destruction of Romania. Only a pro-German government can save <b>us...</b> <b>What</b> is happening on the frontier with Bukovina is a scandal, because new waves of Jews are flooding into the country. Rather than a Romania again invaded by kikes, it would be better to have a German protectorate.|$|E

25|$|The formal {{cause is}} its form, i.e., the {{arrangement}} of that matter. It tells <b>us</b> <b>what</b> a thing is, that any thing {{is determined by the}} definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar {{in the mind of the}} sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.|$|E
25|$|Delaware {{experienced}} all {{the contention}} and bitterness of a border {{state in the}} Civil War and the {{events leading up to}} it, but because of its location and certain decisive military action, was spared much of the bloodshed of Kentucky and Missouri. Nevertheless, the divisions in communities and families, and their corresponding strong feelings were the same. A slave state with very few slaves or slaveholders, many in Delaware had an attitude they called “states rights,” which really meant, “Outsiders are not going to tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> to do.” Given the close economic ties to Philadelphia, and the geographical separation from the Confederacy, there was little sentiment for actual secession. However, the opposition to the abolitionist and voting rights agenda of the Republican federal government were strong enough to create considerable contentiousness. These feeling were strongest in the two lower counties, which still had a majority of the population in 1860, and completely dominated the General Assembly, the real decision maker in the state.|$|E
25|$|Imagine {{a pair of}} {{particles}} that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how {{they are going to}} be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling <b>us</b> <b>what</b> the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.|$|E

25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E
25|$|One might further {{hypothesize that}} the {{experimental}} treatment regulates cholesterol, because the treatment seems to selectively regulate genes associated with cholesterol. While {{this may be}} true, {{there are a number}} of reasons why making this a firm conclusion based on enrichment alone represents an unwarranted leap of faith. One previously mentioned issue has to do with the observation that gene regulation may have no direct impact on protein regulation: even if the proteins coded for by these genes do nothing other than make cholesterol, showing that their mRNA is altered does not directly tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> is happening at the protein level. It is quite possible that the amount of these cholesterol-related proteins remains constant under the experimental conditions. Second, even if protein levels do change, perhaps there is always enough of them around to make cholesterol as fast as it can be possibly made, that is, another protein, not on our list, is the rate determining step in the process of making cholesterol. Finally, proteins typically play many roles, so these genes may be regulated not because of their shared association with making cholesterol but because of a shared role in a completely independent process.|$|E

500|$|Lennon later {{retracted}} many of {{the comments}} he made in that era, attributing them to his anger. He subsequently spoke with great affection and fondness for Martin.

500|$|In 1959, On the {{occasion}} of Delage's 80th birthday, Paul Le Flem declaimed [...] "the artistic perfection that always gives way before the Apollonian pleasure of music: music and poetry, that which is not for surprising <b>us.</b> <b>What</b> puzzles some, which seems grossly unfair to me, is the conspiracy of silence that slowly weaves around this musician who knows the value of silence, shade, solitude." ...|$|E

500|$|Gawain's {{function}}, as medieval scholar Alan Markman says, [...] "is {{the function}} of the romance hero… to stand as the champion of the human race, and by submitting to strange and severe tests, to demonstrate human capabilities for good or bad action." [...] Through Gawain's adventure, it becomes clear that he is merely human. The reader becomes attached to this human view {{in the midst of the}} poem's romanticism, relating to Gawain's humanity while respecting his knightly qualities. Gawain [...] "shows <b>us</b> <b>what</b> moral conduct is. We shall probably not equal his behaviour, but we admire him for pointing out the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Tonight {{features}} indie rock, dance-punk, new wave, electropop, and art rock throughout. In {{an interview}} with Billboard, Kapranos said that the album is [...] "the opposite of punk/pop, which took something that was wonderful and removed all the dirt." [...] He {{also said that the}} band was using Russian Polyvox synthesizers. He also stated, in a Rolling Stone interview, that the album is more of a dance than a rock record. A song on the album previously known as [...] "Kiss Me", presumably re-titled [...] "No You Girls", uses a human skeleton for percussion, to which The Guardian jokingly, in response, asked [...] "Have Glasgow's finest gone all goth on <b>us?</b> <b>What</b> next? Zombie hunting? Gigs at the necropolis?" ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{press conference}} held in November 2007, Arjona stated, in {{relation}} to Quién Dijo Ayer themes, that [...] "yesterday is the cumulus of this that put us here, which raised us and made <b>us</b> <b>what</b> we are, for good or bad." [...] He {{also said that the}} album was more than a compilation, and that [...] "it's an album with all the features of the typical greatest hits disc." [...] After spending the majority of his career signed to Sony, and later, Sony BMG, Arjona signed a long-term recording deal with Warner Music Latina in September 2008. This departure made Quien Dijo Ayer the last album the artist directly released on his former label.|$|E

500|$|On January 12, 2015, the University of Virginia {{reinstated}} the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity {{after the}} police investigation concluded that no incident had {{occurred at the}} fraternity. According to Charlottesville Police Capt.

[...] On March 23, 2015, police noted that Jackie refused to cooperate with law enforcement during the investigation. [...] Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo explained, [...] "We would've loved to have had Jackie come in ... and tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> happened so we can obtain justice ... even if the facts were different." ...|$|E
500|$|Fantasia {{began to}} make a profit from its $2.28 million budget after its return to theaters on December 17, 1969. The film was {{promoted}} with a psychedelic-styled advertising campaign, and it became popular among teenagers and college students who reportedly appreciated it as a psychedelic experience. Animator Ollie Johnston recalled that young people [...] "thought we were on a trip when we made it... every time we'd go to talk to a school or something, they'd ask <b>us</b> <b>what</b> we were on." [...] The release is also noted for the controversial removal of four scenes from The Pastoral Symphony over racial stereotyping. Fantasia was issued on a regular basis, typically for exhibition in art houses in college towns, until the mid-1970s.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Robert Canning of IGN gave it an 8.5 rating, {{stating that}} it was [...] "Great" [...] and [...] "Overall, {{this was a great}} return to form for an appearance from Sideshow Bob. The vengeful character has been let down by recent episodes, but 'The Bob Next Door' has reminded <b>us</b> <b>what</b> makes Bob so much fun." [...] Canning later named [...] "The Bob Next Door" [...] the best episode of the season tied with [...] "The Squirt and the Whale". TV Fanatic gave the episode four out of five and stated that they enjoyed the plot twists but thought the jokes were unfunny, remarking that [...] "the episode just didn't have the same humor as say, 'Cape Feare'." ...|$|E
