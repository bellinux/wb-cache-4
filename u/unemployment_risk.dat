40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} labor <b>unemployment</b> <b>risk</b> on corporate financing decisions.

The impact of reduced <b>unemployment</b> <b>risk</b> on financial policy is especially strong for firms that have greater layoff separation rates, labor intensity, and financing constraints.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{household}} level data {{are used to}} explore whether <b>unemployment</b> <b>risk</b> {{is an important factor}} in the timing of consumers' durable goods purchase decisions. A theoretical model is presented in which both income uncertainty and household debt play a direct role, offering a potential explanation for fluctuations in durable goods spending over the business cycle. The model predicts that consumers respond to increases in <b>unemployment</b> <b>risk</b> by postponing purchases of the durable good and reducing their spending on nondurable goods in order to bolster their precautionary buffer-stock of liquid assets. Consistent with the model, there is evidence that <b>unemployment</b> <b>risk</b> has a direct effect on the timing of home purchases: households with a higher probability of becoming unemployed are less likely to have recently purchased a home or a car, even after controlling for demographic variables. A prediction that the consumption decisions of older consumers are relatively less sensitive to <b>unemployment</b> <b>risk</b> is also validated.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the driving forces behind recent changes in labour market entry outcomes in Europe. Based on data for 12 European countries from the 1988 - 1997 European Community Labour Force Survey, the empirical analyses estimate panel data models to assess the effects of cyclical changes in aggregate economic conditions, changing youth cohort sizes, increasing educational expansion and structural changes in labour demand on market entrants <b>unemployment</b> <b>risks</b> and occupational allocation. In general, it is found that <b>unemployment</b> <b>risks</b> have closely followed the evolution of aggregate economic conditions with only little impact of demographic factors. Changes in occupational allocation, in turn, are much dependent on the relative evolution of educational expansion and professionalization tendencies. In addition, these trends do not affect all leavers evenly: the lowest qualified are most heavily affected by cyclical changes in economic conditions, while leavers from tertiary level education have been more strongly affected by trends of changing occupational attainment. Most discomforting, however, increasing labour force professionalization is found to contribute to increasing labour market difficulties among the lowest qualifiedAustria; Belgium; Denmark; France; Germany; Greece; Ireland; Italy; Netherlands; Poland; Spain; sociology; unemployment; U.

Risks are reduced only during the cyclical periods of growth when employees can take advantage of lateral interfirm changes.

40|$|Price Level Determination When Tax Payments Are Required in Money. We formalize {{the idea}} that the price level can be {{determined}} by a requirement that taxes be paid in money. We show that if households have to pay a money tax of a fixed real value and the money supply is constant, there is a unique stationary price level, and a continuum of non-stationary deflationary equilibria. The non-stationary equilibria can be excluded if we introduce an arbitrarily lax borrowing constraint. Thus, in the basic model, tax requirements can uniquely determine the price level. When money has liquidity value, tax requirements can exclude self-fulfilling hyperinflations. The New Keynesian Transmission Mechanism: A Heterogeneous-Agent Perspective. We argue that a two-agent version of the standard New Keynesian model - where a "worker'' receives only labor income and a "capitalist'' only profit income - offers insights about how income inequality affects the monetary transmission mechanism. Under rigid prices, monetary policy has no effect on output as workers choose not to change their hours worked in response to wage movements. In the corresponding representative-agent model, in contrast, hours do rise after a monetary policy loosening due to a wealth effect on labor supply: profits fall, thus reducing the representative worker's income. If wages are rigid too, however, the monetary transmission mechanism is active and resembles that in the corresponding representative-agent model. Consumption Dynamics under Time-varying <b>Unemployment</b> <b>Risk.</b> We argue that adjustment frictions for durable goods generate a powerful amplification channel from fluctuations in <b>unemployment</b> <b>risk</b> to aggregate consumption demand. First, we use survey data to document that durable expenditures react strongly to increased <b>unemployment</b> <b>risk,</b> while the effect on nondurable expenditures is indistinguishable from zero. Second, we propose and calibrate a buffer-stock savings model that includes adjustment frictions for durable goods. Although not targeted in the calibration, we find that the model reproduces the semi-elasticities of expenditures to <b>unemployment</b> <b>risk</b> estimated in the data. Using the model, we find that the inclusion of adjustment frictions raises the aggregate demand response of durable goods to fluctuations in perceived <b>unemployment</b> <b>risk</b> by approximately 200 percent. Moreover, upon experiencing an adverse risk shock, the responsiveness of aggregate demand for durable goods to the interest rate and transitory income shocks is dampened. Consumption Dynamics under Time-varying Unemployment Risk: Evidence from Time Series Data. We investigate the relationship between consumption expenditures and <b>unemployment</b> <b>risk</b> using aggregate time series data for the US and ten EU countries. As a proxy for perceived <b>unemployment</b> <b>risk,</b> we use data on households' subjective expectations over the future unemployment rate. First, we employ a single-equation framework to test whether subjective unemployment expectations predict aggregate consumption growth when controlling for predicted aggregate income growth. Second, we exploit the timing of the survey interviews in relation to the publication of official statistics to isolate exogenous innovations to unemployment expectations in a small-scale vector autoregression. For the US, both methods suggest that there is a large effect of <b>unemployment</b> <b>risk</b> on aggregate consumption. For the ten EU countries, the evidence is mixed...|$|E

40|$|Why do some {{countries}} institutionalize a social program compensating the unemployed while others do not?

30|$|Another {{possibility}} to address labor market segmentation is expanding ALMPs and human-capital investment in particular.
