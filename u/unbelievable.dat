5|$|It's {{the true}} {{definition}} of hell. It's very dangerous, {{especially in the}} first kilometre when we enter it at more than 60kh. It's <b>unbelievable.</b> The bike goes in all directions. It will be a real spectacle but I don't know if it's really necessary to impose it on us.|$|E
5|$|As an {{opponent}} of the Vietnam War, Bedell signed a petition urging against United States military intervention in Iraq. This petition was signed {{with the names of}} 70 former Congressmen from the 1970s and was presented in a press conference on March 15, 2003. Bedell said that it was <b>unbelievable</b> for the United States to settle disputes with war, and he said that an Iraq war would be similar to the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Mulch Diggums– A kleptomaniac dwarf {{whom the}} LEP {{recruits}} use {{to gain access}} to Fowl Manor during the siege, due to his many hereditary abilities, such as tunneling at <b>unbelievable</b> speeds. Having forfeited his magic years ago to allow him to follow a life of crime, he is immune to the restrictions of the Book of the People.|$|E
5|$|This {{version was}} criticised {{even before the}} museum board had had time to present their own view. August Brunius, who had {{expressed}} his enthusiasm for the Gustav Vasa painting, reacted against the choice of subject, like most critics. The choice of subject was only aggravated by {{the way it was}} presented. Brunius felt the painting to be unreal, <b>unbelievable</b> and not very relevant for the modern Swedes of the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} major league debut against the Boston Red Sox on Opening Day on April 3, 2006, {{and got his}} first major league hit in his first major league at bat, off Curt Schilling. Kinsler said: The crowd was full; I had the {{butterflies}} going, so to get that hit was huge. The family was in town.... To {{go out there and}} face one of the best pitchers of all time, you've got to be locked in. It's your first game, your first big league experience—it was <b>unbelievable</b> to face that guy.|$|E

5|$|Building on {{the success}} of Lad: A Dog, Terhune went on to pen thirty {{additional}} canine novels, including two featuring Lad. Further Adventures of Lad, which includes the stories of his arrival at the Place and his death, was published in George H. Doran in 1922. Like the first, it {{went on to become a}} best seller, praised by both new readers and existing fans. Critics, however, gave it more mixed reviews. Though some praised the stories and Lad, others felt Lad was <b>unbelievable</b> and harshly denounced Terhune's writing style. Lad of Sunnybank was released in 1929 by HarperCollins, and included another selection of stories about Lad's life. Two of the collies that appear in Lad: A Dog, Lad's son Wolf and another collie named Bruce, both received their own novels. Bruce was published by E. P. Dutton in 1920 and Wolf was published by Doran in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Home Made Mince Pie is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a comedy of circumstances, in which the Gale family is going to host a dinner. The focus of the humor is in a mince pie that brandy is added to {{in an attempt to}} make it more appreciable, but three people each add brandy to the pie. Everyone becomes tipsy upon eating the pie, including the family cat, and the film concludes. No cast or staff credits for this film are known. The film was released on September 27, 1910, to mixed reviews in trade publications. Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was <b>unbelievable</b> that one pie split eight ways would be able to impact everyone. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Raspe, {{probably}} {{for fear of}} a libel suit from the real-life Baron von Münchhausen, never admitted his authorship of the book. It was often credited to Bürger, sometimes with an accompanying rumor that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen had met Bürger in Pyrmont and dictated the entire work to him. Another rumor, which circulated widely soon after the German translation was published, claimed {{that it was a}} competitive collaboration by three University of Göttingen scholars—Bürger, Abraham Gotthelf Kästner, and Georg Christoph Lichtenberg—with each of the three trying to outdo one another by writing the most <b>unbelievable</b> tale. The scholar Johann Georg Meusel correctly credited Raspe for the core text, but mistakenly asserted that Raspe had written it in German and that an anonymous translator was responsible for the English version. Raspe's authorship was finally proven in 1824 by Bürger's biographer, Karl Reinhard.|$|E
5|$|Todd {{purchases}} an SS uniform from {{a costume}} shop, and forces Dussander to wear it. When he {{spends more time}} with the old man, his grades suffer, he loses interest in his girlfriend, and he conceals his bad grades from his parents. In turn, the Nazi blackmails the young boy into studying to restore his grades, threatening to expose the boy's subterfuge and his dalliance with Nazism to his parents. Dussander even poses as Todd's grandfather and goes to an appointment with Todd's school counselor Edward French (David Schwimmer). Talking about the war crimes affects both {{the old man and the}} young boy, and an intoxicated Dussander attempts to kill a cat in his gas oven but fails when it attacks him and escapes. Dussander also takes great pride in Todd's <b>unbelievable</b> turnaround, going from near dropout to straight A's in a matter of weeks.|$|E

25|$|The Humanist Association of Ireland ran {{a series}} of {{advertisements}} on Dublin commuter trains which they called the <b>Unbelievable</b> Campaign. The campaign was to highlight that judges and the president {{have to take a}} religious oath, which effectively stops 250,000 people from taking these posts.|$|E
25|$|On 28 December 2009, the BBC Radio 4 panel game The <b>Unbelievable</b> Truth, {{hosted by}} {{frequent}} QI guest panellist David Mitchell, broadcast a New Year's Special which {{paid tribute to}} QI.

25|$|Lycidas {{finds it}} <b>unbelievable</b> that Alcon {{could have won}} a song contest against Nyctilus, but Astylus insists on Alcon's skill. The debate becomes {{increasingly}} heated, and Lycidas challenges Astylus to a song contest - Astylus mocks him in response. Lycidas suggests that Mnasyllus (who has just turned up at the scene) should act as judge.|$|E
25|$|And {{they were}} some of the most unassuming, laid-back people to ever work with. I mean, they had no {{attitude}} at all. They just came in and they were just really polite and very thankful, and then when they turned on the amps and made that noise, it was just <b>unbelievable</b> that it was coming from them.|$|E
25|$|Young {{children}} learn {{from experience that}} stating an untruth can avoid punishment for misdeeds, before they develop the theory of mind necessary to understand why it works. In this stage of development, children will sometimes tell outrageous and <b>unbelievable</b> lies, because they lack the conceptual framework to judge whether a statement is believable, or even to {{understand the concept of}} believability.|$|E
25|$|This president, by {{engaging}} in such incredible abuses of power, breaches of trust with both the Congress and the American people, and misleading us into this tragic and <b>unbelievable</b> war, the violation of treaties, other international law, our constitution, our own domestic laws, and then his role in heinous human rights abuses; I think all of that together calls for impeachment.|$|E

25|$|In 2017 he {{organized}} with Pinault Foundation a solo exhibition, {{taking place in}} Venice contemporarily to the Biennale in two places of the city: Palazzo Grassi and Punta della Dogana. The title is Treasures from the Wreck of the <b>Unbelievable,</b> purporting to present ancient treasures from a sunken Greek ship, with findings that range from the Ancient Egyptian-alike items to Disney characters reproductions, incrustated of shells and corals.|$|E
25|$|Just as {{it looked}} like United's chance {{to get back to}} the Premier Division had gone, Brian Welsh popped up with a last-minute header which sparked <b>unbelievable</b> scenes at Tannadice and take the game into extra-time.

25|$|Three sets of train crew, being driver, fireman {{and guard}} (one fireman's post {{was not being}} filled). The drivers did not work off the EKLR. The guard {{occupied}} the brake compartment in the passenger carriage, did the shunting at unstaffed stations and sold tickets. The published assertion {{that he had to}} clamber along the outside of the carriage in order to sell tickets while the train was moving is <b>unbelievable,</b> and needs confirmation.|$|E
25|$|I'm just shocked. It's <b>unbelievable.</b> I {{feel like}} my dream has come true, the dream I've been dreaming since a little girl has come true. There were points I thought, 'You know what, I don't {{know if this is}} going to happen'. But with the help from my friends and my family, they all kept telling me to believe in myself and keep on doing it and I did and now I'm here and thank you so much to them.|$|E
25|$|Another {{confrontation}} with the Americans broke out soon after the armistice when the French sent troops to occupy the French-speaking Italian border region of Val d'Aoste. The French commander threatened to open fire on American troops if they tried to stop them, and an irate Truman ordered the immediate end to all arms shipments to France, and sent de Gaulle an angry letter saying that he found it <b>unbelievable</b> that the French could threaten to attack American troops after they had done so much to liberate France.|$|E
25|$|As of the 2013 season Wasim Jaffer {{travelled}} to England {{where he}} played for Ainsdale CC in the LDCC league. Here he enjoyed a successful {{first half of the}} season scoring multiple centuries and a had an <b>unbelievable</b> strike rate of 97.93 and a top score of 153 not out. However injury ruined his time at Ainsdale as he had to return home to India for an operation on his knee. Wasim hopes to have a successful 2014 season now after recovering from his injury.|$|E
25|$|Shelly's career {{breakthrough}} as {{an actress}} came when she was cast by independent filmmaker Hal Hartley as the lead in The <b>Unbelievable</b> Truth (1989) and Trust (1990). Trust was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, where Hartley's script tied for the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award. Shelly also guest-starred {{in a number of}} television series including Law & Order, Oz and , and played major roles in over two dozen off-Broadway plays, often at Manhattan's Workhouse Theater. In 2005 she appeared in the film Factotum starring Matt Dillon.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a popular}} myth, Elvis himself entered an Elvis {{lookalike}} contest at a local restaurant shortly before his death, and came in third place. This fabricated myth was featured as a news item in the Weekly World News, and has been misunderstood to be factual by {{people who do not}} realize that the Weekly World News is well known to publish outlandish and often <b>unbelievable</b> articles. This joke may have its origins in Charlie Chaplin, who once did enter a lookalike contest and is often reported to have also placed third, although Chaplin's actual ranking in the contest is not known.|$|E
25|$|On {{the next}} day, the players wore black armbands. Before {{the start of}} play, the teams {{assembled}} in the ground. The players and the crowd stood bareheaded and in silence for two minutes before the match resumed at 11:30. Five Durham cricketers acted as his pall-bearers. At the inquest his death was put down to heart disease, following double pneumonia two years earlier. A post-mortem examination disclosed an abnormally large heart that the doctor said made it almost <b>unbelievable</b> that Nichol lived such a long active life. Nichol was {{engaged to be married}} to Dorothy Ayers.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{told the}} Sunday Times that ‘From {{the age of}} 13, I wanted to play cricket for England. I’ve never felt any shame in saying this is what I wanted to do. And the people at home {{involved}} in cricket, they were like, “Fair play, it’s going to be <b>unbelievable</b> if you make it”. So I’ve never had any shame about this and my father’s never had any shame about it.’ England {{is one of the}} ten full members of the International Cricket Council, while Ireland is an associate member. Only full member nations can play a full schedule of international cricket, including Test matches.|$|E
25|$|The {{third part}} of the novel {{describes}} a conversation between Pi and two officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport, who are conducting an inquiry into the shipwreck. They meet him at the hospital in Mexico where he is recovering. Pi tells them his tale, but the officials reject it as <b>unbelievable.</b> Pi then offers them a second story {{in which he is}} adrift on a lifeboat not with zoo animals, but with the ship's cook, a Taiwanese sailor with a broken leg, and his own mother. The cook amputates the sailor's leg for use as fishing bait, then kills the sailor himself as well as Pi's mother for food, and soon he is killed by Pi, who dines on him.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, two {{employees}} of Sveriges Radio contacted Guillou at Folket i Bild/Kulturfront {{with a story}} of a colleague that had been recruited by a CIA officer in Stockholm. They had earlier been turned down by a major newspaper, and now asked the journalist that had exposed IB if he could publish the story. The three worked out a scenario where the CIA recruiter could be legally accused of espionage, and instructed the recruit to collect evidence thereof. <b>Unbelievable</b> enough, the CIA officer agreed to give his spy written instructions of what information to retrieve, so the informal counter-intelligence group had only to stockpile these, take photographs of the two spies meeting, and discuss how much they needed before the final exposure would be made.|$|E
25|$|Cho {{made another}} miraculous comeback, {{this time in}} 1992 against his biggest rival Kobayashi Koichi in the Honinbo. Kobayashi had {{challenged}} for the Honinbo in 1990 and 1991, but Cho was too stubborn to give it up. Cho had come back in both finals, being down 3 games to 1, but pulled back 3 wins to defend the Honinbo. In 1991, he was down 2 to 0 in 1990, then won 4 {{games in a row}} to defend once more. In 1992, it was even more <b>unbelievable.</b> Cho was losing 3 games to 0, but was so relentless, that he came back and won 4 straight games once more to take the Honinbo away from Kobayashi's grip. This certainly showed that Cho could come back from any deficit and win again.|$|E
25|$|While Don Quixote is {{unconscious}} in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, {{the parish}} curate {{and the local}} barber burn most of his chivalric and other books. A large part of this section consists of the priest deciding which books deserve to be burned and which to be saved. It is a scene of high comedy: If the books are so bad for morality, how does the priest know them well enough to describe every naughty scene? Even so, this gives an occasion for many comments on books Cervantes himself liked and disliked. For example, Cervantes' own pastoral novel La Galatea is saved, while the rather <b>unbelievable</b> romance Felixmarte de Hyrcania is burned. After the books are dealt with, they seal up the room which contained the library, later telling Don Quixote {{that it was the}} action of a wizard (encantador).|$|E
