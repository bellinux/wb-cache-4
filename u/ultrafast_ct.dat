5000|$|The Agatston {{score is}} derived from the work of Drs. Agatston and Janowitz of the University of Miami School of Medicine and dates back into the 1980s. The {{original}} work was based on electron beam computed tomography (also known as <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT</b> or EBCT). The score is calculated using a weighted value assigned to the highest density of calcification in a given coronary artery. The density is measured in Hounsfield units, and score of 1 for 130-199 HU, 2 for 200-299 HU, 3 for 300-399 HU, and 4 for 400 HU and greater. This weighted score is then multiplied by the area (in square millimeters) of the coronary calcification. For example, a [...] "speck" [...] of coronary calcification in the left anterior descending artery measures 4 square millimeters and has a peak density of 270 HU. The score is therefore 8 (4 square millimeters × weighted score of 2). The tomographic slices of the heart are 3 millimeters thick and average about 50-60 slices from the coronary artery ostia to the inferior wall of the heart. The calcium score of every calcification in each coronary artery for all of the tomographic slices is then summed up to give the total coronary artery calcium score (CAC score).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Current imaging {{modalities}} {{can provide}} only a qualitative or semiquantitative {{measure of the}} severity of aortic regurgitation. Ultrafast computed tomography (CT) has the capability of rapid imaging (17 frames/sec) coupled with high spatial resolution (1. 5 mm 2). Eight millimeter thick images can be acquired to interrogate simultaneously the right and left ventricles. End-diastolic and end-systolic tomograms can be reconstructed serially from apex to base by Simpson's rule to provide end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes from which the right and left ventricular stroke volumes can be derived. To determine whether the difference between left and right ventricular stroke volume measured with <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT</b> could be used to estimate the volume of experimentally induced aortic regurgitation, we studied six dogs in which proximal aortic electromagnetic flow probes had been implanted. Varying degrees of aortic regurgitation were induced by manipulation of a basket catheter through the aortic valve. During suspended respiration in the control state in the absence of aortic regurgitation, right and left ventricular stroke volumes measured with <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT</b> were nearly identical (mean difference 1. 0 + 1. 2 ml [mean ± SE]). In the presence of varying degrees of aortic regurgitation, regurgitant volume derived by <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT</b> as {{the difference between right and}} left ventricular stroke volumes correlated closely to the regurgitant volume measured by the electromagnetic flow probe (r =. 99, slope =. 92...|$|E
40|$|Background: Real-time {{three-dimensional}} echocargiography (RT- 3 D-Echo) and ultrafast {{computed tomography}} (CT) are two novel methods {{for the analysis of}} LV ejection fraction and volumes. Objective: To compare LVEF and volume measurements as obtained using RT- 3 D-Echo and <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT.</b> Methods: Thirty nine consecutive patients (27 men, mean age of 57 ± 12 years) were studied using RT- 3 D-Echo and 64 -slice <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT.</b> LVEF and LV volumes were analyzed. Statistical analysis: coefficient of correlation (r: Pearson), Bland-Altman analysis, linear regression analysis, 95 % CI, p< 0. 05. Results: RT- 3 D-Echo measurements: LVEF ranged from 56. 1 to 78. 6 (65. 5 ± 5. 58) %; end-diastolic volume ranged from 49. 6 to 178. 2 (87 ± 27. 8) ml; end-systolic volume ranged from 11. 4 to 78 (33. 1 ± 13. 6) ml. CT scan measurements: LVEF ranged from 53 to 86 % (67. 8 ± 7. 78); end-diastolic volume ranged from 51 to 186 (106. 5 ± 30. 3) ml; end-systolic volume ranged from 7 to 72 (35. 5 ± 13. 4) ml. Correlations between RT- 3 D-Echo and CT were: LVEF (r: 0. 7888, p< 0. 0001, 95 % CI 0. 6301 to 0. 8843); end-diastolic volume (r: 0. 7695, p< 0. 0001, 95 % CI 0. 5995 to 0. 8730); end-systolic volume (r: 0. 8119, p< 0. 0001, 95 % CI 0. 6673 to 0. 8975).

40|$|The {{interaction}} of exciton and charge transfer (CT) states plays {{a central role}} in photo-induced CT processes in chemistry, biology and physics. In this work, we use a combination of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2 D-ES), pump-probe measurements and quantum chemistry to investigate the <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT</b> dynamics in a lutetium bisphthalocyanine dimer in different oxidation states. It is found that in the anionic form, the combination of strong CT-exciton interaction and electronic asymmetry induced by a counter-ion enables CT between the two macrocycles of the complex on a 30 fs timescale. Following optical excitation, a chain of electron and hole transfer steps gives rise to characteristic cross-peak dynamics in the electronic 2 D spectra, and we monitor how the excited state charge density ultimately localizes on the macrocycle closest to the counter-ion within 100 fs. A comparison with the dynamics in the radical species further elucidates how CT states modulate the electronic structure and tune fs-reaction dynamics.

In general, <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT</b> and slow CR are desirable for optimal device performance. In this Letter, the ultrafast excited-state CT between platinum oligomer (DPP-Pt(acac)) as a new electron donor and porphyrin as an electron acceptor is monitored {{for the first time}} using femtosecond (fs) transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy with broad-band capability and 120 fs temporal resolution.

Our time-resolved data show that the CT and CS between DPP-Pt(acac) and cationic porphyrin are ultrafast (approximately 1. 5 ps), and the CR is slow (ns time scale), as inferred from the formation and the decay of the cationic and anionic species.

To {{evaluate}} two <b>ultrafast</b> cone-beam <b>CT</b> (UF-CBCT) imaging protocols {{with different}} acquisition and injection parameters regarding image quality and required contrast media during image-guided hepatic transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Methods. In 80 patients (male: 46, female: 34; mean age: 56. 8 years; range: 33 – 83) UF-CBCT was performed during TACE for intraprocedural guidance. Imaging was performed using two ultrafast CBCT acquisition protocols with different acquisition and injection parameters (imaging protocol 1 : acquisition time 2. 54 [*]s, and contrast 6 [*]mL with 3 [*]s delay; imaging protocol 2 : acquisition time 2. 72 [*]s, and contrast 7 [*]mL with 6 [*]s delay).

40|$|A {{profound}} {{understanding of}} charge transfer (CT) at semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and nanoclusters (NCs) interfaces {{is extremely important}} to optimize the energy conversion efficiency in QDs and NCs-based solar cell devices. Here, {{we report on the}} ground- and excited-state interactions at the interface of two different bimolecular non-covalent donor-acceptor (D-A) systems using steady-state and femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy with broadband capabilities. We systematically investigate the electrostatic interactions between the positively charged fullerene derivative C 60 -(N,N dimethylpyrrolidinium iodide) (CF) employed as an efficient molecular acceptor and two different donor molecules: Ag 29 nanoclusters (NCs) and CdTe quantum dots (QDs). For comparison purposes, we also monitor the interaction of each donor molecule with the neutral fullerene derivative C 60 -(malonic acid) n, which has minimal electrostatic interactions. Our steady-state and time-resolved data demonstrate that both QDs and NCs have strong interfacial electrostatic interactions and dramatic fluorescence quenching when the CF derivative is present. In other words, our results reveal that only CF can be in close molecular proximity with the QDs and NCs, allowing <b>ultrafast</b> photoinduced <b>CT</b> to occur. It turned out that the intermolecular distances, electronic coupling and subsequently CT from the excited QDs or NCs to fullerene derivatives can be controlled by the interfacial electrostatic interactions.

40|$|Coronary artery calcium is {{invariably}} {{associated with}} atherosclerosis {{and has been}} linked to an increased risk of coronary events. Ultrafast computed tomography (CT) was recently used to document the presence and relative quantity of coronary calcium. The use of the self-reported coronary risk factors to identify persons with coronary calcium as documented by <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT</b> screening was examined in 458 men and 139 women aged 26 to 81 years (88 % asymptomatic). All subjects underwent <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT</b> scanning, and received a questionnaire and underwent an interview regarding medical and risk factor history.

30|$|In {{comparing}} {{the use of}} CT versus MRI in the workup of ischemic stroke, {{a number of factors}} come under consideration. When <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT</b> scanners covering almost the entire brain are used, the potential to detect ischemia and salvageable tissue is almost equal in both techniques. The major drawback of CT is the high radiation dose, while in MRI it is the more complicated and time consuming aspect of the examination. Thus, if any general practical recommendation can be made, acute stroke patients should be evaluated by native CT followed by PCT, with MRI reserved for more chronic cases of brain ischemia or control examinations in stroke patients. However, when state-of-the-art CT and high-quality MR scanners are utilised, both techniques are practically equivalent in the hands of experienced personnel, and local clinical configurations may often dictate which technique should be used.|$|E
30|$|Another {{drawback}} of CT is {{the high}} radiation dose. CT {{is considered to be}} a major source of radiation in developed countries [32]. Although <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT</b> scanners together with iterative reconstructions can significantly reduce the radiation dose in some applications, such as abdominal or cardiac CT, in perfusion CT of the brain the dose still remains relatively high (mean effective dose is approximately 5  mSv) [33]. Additionally, the long reconstruction times of iterative techniques, in the range of minutes, are inconvenient for stroke patient management. There are however techniques that are able to decrease the radiation dose to values comparable to unenhanced brain CT (approximately 2  mSv). A decrease from 140 – 120  kV to 100 – 80  kV not only significantly lowers the radiation dose, but also increases the prominence of the contrast agent because of the greater importance of the photoelectric effect for 80 -kV photons [34]. Another method for dose reduction relies on decreasing the image frequency of acquisition from the PCT first-pass data [35].|$|E
40|$|Recent advancements in imaging {{technology}} enable the noninvasive assessment of atherosclerotic plaques in arteries throughout the body. High-resolution multisclice computed tomography (MSCT) - {{sometimes referred to}} as multidetector spriral or just MDCT - and cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) provide information about the arterial wall that is unavailable with the most other methods, including angiography. Moreover, MSCT and MR are making great strides in the characterizatuion of plaque composition and microanatomy, thus leading to the identification of lesions that are vulnerable to rupture or erosion. This information may aid in the selection of patients most likely to benefit from early intervention, including lipid-lowering drug regimens. There would be considerable advantage, too, in developing a noninvasive means of detecting coronary artery stenosis. Until now, QCA has been invaluable for detecting stenosis while <b>ultrafast</b> computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> and cardiac MR have shown promise for showing details of the plaques that are detected.

40|$|Purpose: Scatter {{artifacts}} severely degrade {{image quality}} of cone-beam CT (CBCT). We present an ultrafast scatter correction framework by using GPU-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and prior patient CT image, aiming at automatically finish {{the whole process}} including both scatter correction and reconstruction within 30 seconds. Methods : The method consists of six steps: 1) FDK reconstruction using raw projection data; 2) Rigid Registration of planning CT to the FDK results; 3) MC scatter calculation at sparse view angles using the planning CT; 4) Interpolation of the calculated scatter signals to other angles; 5) Removal of scatter from the raw projections; 6) FDK reconstruction using the scatter-corrected projections. In addition to using GPU to accelerate MC photon simulations, we also use {{a small number of}} photons and a down-sampled CT image in simulation to further reduce computation time. A novel denoising algorithm is used to eliminate MC noise from the simulated scatter images caused by low photon numbers. The method is validated on one simulated head-and-neck case with 364 projection angles. Results: We have examined variation of the scatter signal among projection angles using Fourier analysis. It is found that scatter images at 31 angles are sufficient to restore those at all angles with < 0. 1 % error. For the simulated patient case with a resolution of 512 × 512 × 100, we simulated 5 × 10 6 photons per angle. The total computation time is 20. 52 seconds on a Nvidia GTX Titan GPU, and the time at each step is 2. 53, 0. 64, 14. 78, 0. 13, 0. 19, and 2. 25 seconds, respectively. The scatter-induced shading/cupping artifacts are substantially reduced, and the average HU error of a region-of-interest is reduced from 75. 9 to 19. 0 HU. Conclusion : A practical ultrafast MC-based CBCT scatter correction scheme is developed. It accomplished the whole procedure of scatter correction and reconstruction within 30 seconds.

Total calcium score was calculated as the sum of each lesion-specific score, calculated as the product of pixel area and density > 130 Hounsfeld units. Total score was 3 to 6 times greater (p < 0. 01) and the probability of coronary artery calcium 30 to 40 % greater (p < 0. 01) in patients with a reported history of myocardial infarction, positive angiography, bypass surgery or angioplasty.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of chest fast MRI in pre-operative management of patient affected by PE. To obtain the Haller Index (HI) and Asymmetry Index (AI) from chest fast MRI protecting patients from radiation exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the data of 42 consecutive patients with severe PE who underwent minimally invasive repair between March 2007 and March 2010. All 42 patients received chest fast MRI, but only the first 5 {{in view of the}} results, were studied also with chest <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT</b> scan. In both examinations, data at the deepest point of the depression were collected. RESULTS: Severity indices of the deformity using HI and AI, collected from CT scan and fast MRI in the first 5 patients, were comparable. In the remaining 37 fast chest MRI offered good images of the chest wall deformities with no radiation exposure, detailing anatomical information such as displacement and rotation of the heart or great vessels anomalies. CONCLUSION: This study suggests the use of chest MRI in pre operative workup for patients with PE to obtain severity indices (Haller Index and Asymmetry Index avoiding radiation exposure to paediatric patients.

40|$|IntroductionCardiovascular {{disease is}} the first {{leading cause of death}} in {{hemodialysis}} patients. In this population, cardiovascular calcifications occur at an earlier age and progress faster than in general population. Patients and methodsIn order to determine the prevalence and risk factors of cardiac calcifications, 49 patients on chronic hemodialysis were screened in the coronary arteries and cardiac valves by the 64 multislice <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT</b> and the transthoracic echocardiography. Different clinical and biological parameters were studied by the SPSS 10. 0 statistical software to determine risk factors. ResultCardiac calcifications were identified in 81. 6 % of cases in {{at least one of the}} two studied sites. The coronary artery involvement was more common than valvular and concerned 69. 4 % of cases. The mean Agatston coronary artery calcium score (ACACS) was 331. 1 and 522. 2 in coronary patients and was correlated to alteration of systolic function of LV (r=– 0, 287, p= 0, 045). The severity of CACS was positively correlated with age (r= 0. 332, p= 0. 02). Coronary calcifications were associated with cardiovascular risk common to those of the general population (age, male sex, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, history of ischemic heart disease), but also to a lesser quality of dialysis. Valvular calcifications were prent in 49 % of cases and were correlated with left ventricular hypertrophy (p 0. 006). The exclusive involvement of the aortic valve was the most common valvular abnormality. Phosphocalcic and lipid parameters, levels of hemoglobin, CRP and uric acid did not predisposed to cardiac calcifications in our patients. DiscussionIn hemodialysis patients, the pathogenesis of cardiovascular calcification is complex and cannot be attributed to a passive process. This process involves several factors that can promote or inhibit calcification. The new multi-slice ultrafast scanner is a very sensitive method for topographic and quantitative assessment of coronary calcification and is a better alternative to invasive techniques. ConclusionOur study confirms the high prevalence of cardiac calcification in hemodialysis, and highlights the importance of early screening, and treatment of predisposing factors...|$|E
40|$|Already in {{the eighteenth}} century, {{calcification}} of the coronary artery wall was recognized as {{being part of the}} atherosclerotic process. 1 However, only after the recent development of electron-beam tomography (EBT), an <b>ultrafast</b> <b>CT</b> technique, it became possible to accurately quantify the amount of coronary calcification noninvasively. Quantitative measures of coronary calcification, detected by EBT, {{have been found to be}} closely related to the amount of atherosclerotic plaque in histopathologic investigations. 2, 3 Furthermore, the calcium score derived from EBT is strongly associated with the extent of angiographically detected coronary artery disease. 4, 5 Therefore, quantification of coronary calcification using EBT has been proposed as a promising method for noninvasive detection of asymptomatic subjects at high risk of developing coronary heart disease. Studies showing that coronary calcification increases the risk of coronary events have been performed in selected, high-risk populations with small numbers of events. 6 - 10 There are currently no population-based data on the predictive value of coronary calcification. The focus of this thesis is to investigate whether coronary calcification predicts cardiovascular disease in the general population. For this purpose, an epidemiologic study was carried out in the population-based Rotterdam Coronary Calcification Study. The Rotterdam Coronary Calcification Study consists of participants from the Rotterdam Study who underwent EBT scanning of the heart. On the scans, the amount of coronary calcification was computed. Scandata were available for 2013 older adults. In chapter 2, the current knowledge on the pathogenesis, detection and epidemiology of coronary calcification is reviewed. Chapter 3 contains studies on the validation of the scanning and scoring technique. In chapter 4, associations between cardiovascular risk factors and coronary calcification and peripheral atherosclerosis are described. Chapter 5 focuses on the association between coronary calcification and cardiovascular disease.
