40|$|Using {{stochastic}} panel wage frontiers, {{this paper}} estimates the relative <b>underpayment</b> <b>of</b> {{females and males}} in the reunified Germany.

However, the paper suggests that the estimates <b>of</b> <b>underpayment</b> reflect other concerns, such as dynamic monopsony. Labor market inefficiency {{must be taken into}} account before discrimination analysis is possible. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{events that}} led up to this {{involved}} a Phelps Dodge employee in New York who noticed a discrepancy in the declaration made to the Customs House.

He was empowered in law to seize the entire value of the import from Phelps Dodge if the case against them was proven. The Custom House received 50% of any money recovered in this way and the remainder was split between Jayne, his associates and the informer. This system had been in place for many years and was referred to as Moiety.Jayne made an unannounced visit to the Phelps Dodge office and seized their books. Later he informed them that they were liable to pay a forfeit of $1,750,000. Without access to his ledgers, the senior partner of the firm, William E. Dodge, was unable to verify the <b>underpayment</b> <b>of</b> duty and was forced to reach a settlement with Jayne of $271,000.|$|R
