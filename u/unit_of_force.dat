5|$|For {{the sake}} of convenience, some derived units have special names and symbols.

25|$|Since all the {{constants}} {{in these}} relationships is unity, the units {{are said to}} be coherent. Two years later James Thomson, older brother of William Thomson introduced the term poundal as a coherent <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in the Foot–pound–second system (FPS) of measurement. The equivalent FPS unit of work was the foot-poundal.|$|E
25|$|In United States {{customary}} units, {{the pound}} {{can be either}} a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> or a unit of mass. Related units used in some distinct, separate subsystems of units include the poundal and the slug. The poundal {{is defined as the}} force necessary to accelerate an object of one-pound mass at 1ft/s2, and is equivalent to about 1/32.2 of a pound-force. The slug is defined as the amount of mass that accelerates at 1ft/s2 when one pound-force is exerted on it, and is equivalent to about 32.2 pounds (mass).|$|E

50|$|Weighing scales (or weigh scales or scales) are {{devices to}} measure weight or {{calculate}} mass. Spring balances or spring scales measure weight (force) by balancing the force {{due to gravity}} against the force on a spring, whereas a balance or pair of scales using a balance beam compares masses by balancing the weight due to the mass of an object against {{the weight of a}} known mass or masses. Either type can be calibrated to read in <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> such as newtons, or in <b>units</b> <b>of</b> mass such as kilograms, but the balance or pair of scales using a traditional balance beam to compare masses will read correctly for mass even if moved to a place with a different (non-zero) gravitational field strength (but would then not read correctly if calibrated in <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>force),</b> while the spring balance would read correctly in force in a different gravitational field strength (but would not read correctly if calibrated in <b>units</b> <b>of</b> mass).|$|R
2500|$|Other {{systems for}} the {{measurement}} of dynamic quantities that used imperial and US customary units are the British Gravitational System (BG) proposed by Arthur Mason Worthington and the English Engineering System (EE). Both systems depend on the gravitational acceleration, and use the pound-force as the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> but use different approaches when applying Newton's laws of motion. In the BG system, force, rather than mass is a base unit while the slug is a derived unit of inertia (rather than mass). On the other hand, the EE system uses a non-coherent approach and introduce the acceleration due to gravity (g) into its equations. [...] Both these approaches led to slight variations in {{the meaning of the}} pound-force (and also of the kilogram force) {{in different parts of the}} world. [...] Various countries published standard values that should be used for g and in 1901 the CGPM published a standard value for g that should be used in the [...] "International Service of Weights and Measures", namely 9.80665m/s2 (32.174ft/s2) which is equal to the value of g at 45° latitude.|$|E
