Power operated, lowering the top required <b>unlatching</b> two header catches, power lowering the top, exiting the car (or reaching {{over to the}} right side latch), and folding down the rigid section manually. Mazda introduced with the convertible the first integral windblocker, a rigid panel that folded up from behind the passenger seats to block unwanted drafts from reaching the passengers — thereby extending the driving season for the car in open mode. The convertible also featured optional headrest mounted audio speakers and a folding leather snap-fastened tonneau cover. The convertible assembly was precisely engineered and manufactured, and dropped into the ready body assembly as a complete unit — a first in convertible production.|$|E

The Roadster's roof {{is made from}} a [...] "newly developed material" [...] and does not {{take the form of}} a folding metal arrangement, as is common on many modern cars. Following a manual <b>unlatching,</b> it takes ten seconds to fold away electrically.

Search), {{also known}} as the Mini-Research Module 2 (MRM 2), , or МИМ 2. Pirs and Poisk are Russian airlock modules, each having 2 {{identical}} hatches. An outward-opening hatch on the Mir space station failed after it swung open too fast after <b>unlatching,</b> because of a small amount of air pressure remaining in the airlock. A different entry was used, and the hatch was repaired. All EVA hatches on the ISS open inwards and are pressure-sealing. Pirs was used to store, service, and refurbish Russian Orlan suits and provided contingency entry for crew using the slightly bulkier American suits. The outermost docking ports on both airlocks allow docking of Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, and the automatic transfer of propellants to and from storage on the ROS.|$|E

So I see no other remedy than to take the veil, or run the risk of my own ruin and my poor father's. Were there no other reason, the terror of these threats, from a man so notoriously capable of keeping his word, ought as much to prevent my becoming the bride of any worthy man as it should prohibit me from <b>unlatching</b> his door to admit murderers. Oh, good father, what a lot is mine! and how fatal am I likely to prove to my affectionate parent, and to any one with whom I might ally my unhappy fortunes!" ...|$|E

He is often used to stalk suspects, often with a GPS-type object attached to him so that the officers can keep track.|$|E
50|$|A lock bypass is a {{technique}} in lockpicking, of defeating a lock through <b>unlatching</b> the underlying locking mechanism without operating the lock at all. It is commonly used on devices such as combination locks, {{where there is no}} natural access (such as a keyhole) for a tool to reach the locking mechanism. Because the mechanism itself is not being manipulated, this could technically not be considered lockpicking at all. However, it does fall under the repertoire of techniques used to open locks.|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} {{examines}} {{the way in}} which Knowledge <b>Unlatched</b> is combining collective action and open access licenses to encourage innovation in markets for specialist academic books. Knowledge <b>Unlatched</b> is a not for profit organisation that has been established to help a global community of libraries coordinate their book purchasing activities more effectively and, in so doing, to ensure that books librarians select for their own collections become available for free for anyone in the world to read. The Knowledge <b>Unlatched</b> model is an attempt to re-coordinate a market in order to facilitate a transition to digitally appropriate publishing models that include open access. It offers librarians an opportunity to facilitate the open access publication of books that their own readers would value access to. It provides publishers with a stable income stream on titles selected by libraries, as well as an ability to continue selling books to a wider market on their own terms. Knowledge <b>Unlatched</b> provides a rich case study for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding how innovations in procurement practices can be used to stimulate more effective, equitable markets for socially valuable products...|$|R
5000|$|Diaper Genie, a {{creation}} of entrepreneur John Hall, is a baby diaper disposal system. The unit consists of a large plastic container with a plastic lid. The system seals diapers individually in a scented film to protect against germs and odors.

After inserting the diaper, the lid is replaced and twisted three full rotations to seal the diaper inside. After the container is filled with dirty diapers, it can be emptied by <b>unlatching</b> the bottom of the canister, where the diapers fall out still individually sealed. The resulting string of sealed diapers is colloquially known as a [...] "diaper sausage".|$|E

50|$|Jonas lures Angel into killing Celeste as {{she tries}} to escape on board one of Singer's subs, the Prometheus, {{with the rest of the}} crew and rescues Terry, who was nearly killed by Celeste in the airlock like Sergei was. She survived by <b>unlatching</b> a barrel {{containing}} a UNIS robot with the corpse of Heath Williams, a paleobiologist who assisted Terry with avoiding Sergei's assaults. She seals herself in the UNIS and nearly suffocates, but Jonas frees her, also killing a Kronosaurus via pressure changing in the environment it was in and causing its head to implode. On their way up to the surface, the last Kronosaurus attacks Jonas and Terry, but they are saved by Angel who kills the prehistoric marine reptile. The book ends with Angel giving birth to two pups, which flee into the Trench.|$|E
