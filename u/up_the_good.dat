25|$|The Super Kings played Mumbai Indians in the Eliminator at Bangalore. After losing two early wickets, Hussey and Badrinath {{shared a}} 94-run third-wicket {{partnership}} {{to take the}} team to a respectable position. Then, the skipper MS Dhoni and Dwayne Bravo scored 73 runs {{in the last five}} overs to set up a score of 187/5 in 20 overs. Mumbai in their run-chase got off to a brisk start before a dramatic batting collapse. CSK spinners Ashwin and Jakati picked up one wicket each and bowled seven economical overs between them that proved decisive {{in the context of the}} match. CSK won the match by 38 runs and Dhoni was given the Man of the Match for his innings of 51* (20). The win took them to the second Qualifier at Chennai, a match against Delhi Daredevils, to decide who plays in the final. Daredevils won the toss and put Chennai into bat and this decision backfired. Opener Murali Vijay, who had a quiet season until then, came to his own striking a century (113 runs from 60 deliveries, 15 fours and four sixes) to take his team to 222/5. The bowlers backed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> batting by bowling tight line and length and picking up wickets at regular intervals. Only Mahela Jayawardene showed some resistance for Delhi with a knock of 55 but to see his team lose by 86 runs. The win booked CSK's place in the final at their home ground Chennai against the Kolkata Knight Riders. This was the fourth time in five seasons, that CSK had made it to the final of the IPL.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the video, Madonna said it {{was like}} [...] "oody goody gum drops", {{referring}} to the candy-oriented theme of the album. Virginia Heffernan from The New York Times called the video heart-pounding, and compared its momentum with the music video of [...] "Thriller, [...] "In the Air Tonight" [...] and [...] "Shadows of the Night". However, Eric Wilson from the same newspaper commented that the video did not yield a breakout Madonna look compared to her videos from the 1980s. Singer Miley Cyrus created her {{own version of the}} video and posted it on her YouTube channel. Madonna responded to it in her own video and said, [...] "All you {{people out there who are}} making videos to my new single, '4 Minutes,' keep <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> work, nice job."

2500|$|Clough {{is perhaps}} best known now for his short poems Say Not the Struggle Naught Availeth, a rousing call to tired {{soldiers}} to keep <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> fight, Through a Glass Darkly, an exploration of religious faith and [...] doubt, and The Latest Decalogue, a satirical take on the Ten Commandments. The Latest Decalogue's couplet on murder, [...] "Thou shalt not kill; but needst not strive officiously to keep alive:" [...] is often quoted – usually out of context – in debates on medical ethics {{in the sense that}} it is not right to struggle to keep terminally ill people alive, especially if they are suffering.

2500|$|In the South, {{frontier}} {{areas that}} lacked transportation, {{such as the}} Appalachian Mountain region, remained based on subsistence farming and resembled the egalitarianism of their northern counterparts, although they had a larger upper-class of slaveowners. North Carolina was representative. However frontier areas of 1700 that had good river connections were increasingly transformed into plantation agriculture. Rich men came in, bought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> land, and worked it with slaves. The area was no longer [...] "frontier". It had a stratified society comprising a powerful upper-class white landowning gentry, a small middle-class, a fairly large group of landless or tenant white farmers, and a growing slave population {{at the bottom of}} the social pyramid. Unlike the North, where small towns and even cities were common, the South was overwhelmingly rural.|$|E

[...] In February 1898, Sharpe led Yale's basketball team to a 27–7 win over New York's Knickerbocker Athletic Club. [...] A newspaper account of the game praised Yale for its [...] "signal work" [...] in passing the ball {{from one to another}} without a hitch. [...] Sharpe led all scorers with five goals including a halfcourt shot described as follows:"In the second half Sharp wound <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> work of his team by throwing a goal from the centre of the field on a backward pass from Lockwood. [...] The ball sailed through the air and landed in the basket without touching anything. [...] This was an unusual feat." ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{incomplete}} financial market model {{was built to}} illustrate the impacts of the market incompleteness {{on the benefits of}} trade liberalization. Particularly, it will focus on the investigation of the impacts of different sequences of opening <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> market. That is, should <b>the</b> government open <b>up</b> international trade simultaneously with <b>the</b> opening <b>up</b> of <b>the</b> domestic trade, i. e. implementing a 'shock therapy' approach? Or should the government liberalize <b>the</b> domestic <b>goods</b> market first, and then deregulate the international trade, i. e. following a 'gradualism' approach? This paper proves that the gradualism approach by opening <b>up</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>goods</b> market before liberalization of the international trade can guarantee the successive improvement of everyone's welfare. Therefore, the gradualism approach is a Pareto-improvement sequence. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
