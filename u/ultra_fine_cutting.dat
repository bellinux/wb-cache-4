The reinforcement of the mechanical properties occurs to a greater extent when <b>ultra</b> <b>fine</b> particulate fillers are used in comparison with the conventional microdimensional fillers. To achieve all the benefits that the <b>ultra</b> <b>fine</b> fillers can provide, optimal dispersion as primary particles is essential. To achieve better dispersion of the inorganic particles in a polymer matrix, the <b>ultra</b> <b>fine</b> particles (UFP) are added to the polymerisation reactor so that they are dispersed in the monomer before polymerisation. Hence, the monomer is polymerised {{in the presence of the}} UFP (in situ). In this paper the effects of the UFP on the initial monomer dispersion are examined. The presence of the inorganic UFP in the polymerisation reactor influences the properties of the monomer phase and affects the drop size distribution. This in turn influences the grain sizes as well as their distribution, which influence the processability of the resin...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} {{the ability of a}} continuous repetitive corrugation and straightening (CRCS) technique in creating <b>ultra</b> <b>fine</b> grained copper-chromium strips as well as to determine the microstructure evolution and its influence on grain size refinement. Design/methodology/approach: Tests were performed with the 0. 8 mm thick CuCr 0, 6 strips using original die set construction. The changes of mechanical properties as well as microstructure evolution versus circles number of deformation were investigated. The microstructure was investigated using optical and electron microscopy (TEM and SEM equipped with EBSD). Findings: The CRCS process effectively reduced the grain size of a CuCr 0, 6 alloy strips, demonstrating the CRCS as a promising new method for producing <b>ultra</b> <b>fine</b> grained metallic strips. Generally, the mechanism of grain refinement and microstructural evolution during CRCS of CuCr 0, 6 alloy strips is similar to that observed in other high/medium stacking fault energy materials deformed by SPD, i. e. via dislocation manipulation and accumulation. Any effects connected with mechanical twinning were not observable. Research limitations/implications: Investigation results are limited to the initial material in annealed state. Further investigation should focus on the description of influence of deformation-supersaturation-ageing sequence on strengthening effect. Practical implications: A growing trend to use new copper-based functional materials is recently observed world-wide. Within this group of materials particular attention is drawn to those with <b>ultra</b> <b>fine</b> or nanometric grain size of a copper matrix, which show higher mechanical properties than microcrystalline copper. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the mechanical properties of precipitates strengthened <b>ultra</b> <b>fine</b> grained copper - chromium alloy strips obtained by original RCS method and to the microstructure evolution...|$|R
