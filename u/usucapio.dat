Stemming from Roman law and its successor, the Napoleonic Code, adopted as the basis of law in France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and also, in part, by the Netherlands and Germany, adverse possession generally recognizes two time periods for the acquisition of property: 30 years and some lesser time period, depending on the bona fides of the possessor and the location of the parties involved.|$|E
500|$|The thing must be movable, {{if it is}} to be stolen. Whilst an {{immovable}} thing {{cannot be}} carried away, the pre-classical extension to other types of interference with property means that immovable were not by their nature excluded. Gaius indicates that certain veteres ("ancients") believed that land could be stolen. This was also the view of Sabinus, but it was rejected by other classical jurists. A thing separated from the land could be stolen, however. <b>Usucapio</b> was particularly important with regard to land, and therefore the exclusion may have been retained to help the good faith possessor of land to usucapt. Res sanctae and religiosia were covered by separate delicts; and one could not steal a res nullius. [...] One can commit furtum of one's own property, for example by taking back a thing pledged to a creditor, or by secretly reclaiming one's own thing from a good faith possessor. Free persons could also be stolen, for example, children; a wife in manu; indicati and auctorati. This was probably a hang-over from a time when dominium (ownership), manus and potestas were indistinct and not formally separate. Res hereditariae could not be stolen, perhaps for want of a suitable plaintiff with a sufficient interest.|$|E
50|$|Usucaption (Latin <b>usucapio)</b> (in U.S. and U.K. {{known as}} acquisitive prescription) {{is a concept}} found in civil law systems and has its origin in the Roman law of property.|$|E
50|$|<b>Usucapio</b> {{assisted}} two cases: where a {{thing had}} been transferred improperly (for example, transferring a res mancipi by traditio), {{or where the}} transferor of a thing did not hold proper title (for example, sale by a non-owner).|$|E
50|$|<b>Usucapio</b> was {{a concept}} in Roman law {{that dealt with}} the {{acquisition}} of ownership of something through possession. It was subsequently developed as a principle of civil law systems, usucaption. It {{is similar to the}} common law concept of adverse possession, or acquiring land prescriptively.|$|E
50|$|There {{were five}} {{requirements}} for the acquisition of ownership by <b>usucapio.</b> Firstly, the claimant must have had uninterrupted possession for the required period of time. The claimant must have gained the thing with iusta causa and in good faith (bona fides). The thing claimed must be capable of ownership, and must have been at no time been stolen or taken by force.|$|E
5000|$|Auctor in {{the sense}} of [...] "author", comes from auctor as founder or, one might say, [...] "planter-cultivator". Similarly, auctoritas refers to {{rightful}} ownership, based on one's having [...] "produced" [...] or homesteaded the article of property in question - more {{in the sense}} of [...] "sponsored" [...] or [...] "acquired" [...] than [...] "manufactured". This auctoritas would, for example, persist through an <b>usucapio</b> of ill-gotten or abandoned property.|$|E
5000|$|Since mancipatio and in iure cessio were {{inherently}} public {{modes of}} acquisition of ownership, <b>usucapio</b> {{was the only}} private method of the ius civile. Ownership of a thing in Roman law was usually protected forever, until a limit of thirty years was introduced in 426 AD on actions by Theodosius [...] - [...] in other words, preventing {{the owner of a}} thing getting it back or seeking damages after thirty years.|$|E
50|$|Generally, therefore, {{they were}} either {{employed}} by the parties themselves to settle boundaries, or they received their instructions for that purpose from a judex. In this capacity they were advocati. But they also acted as judices, and could give a final decision in that class of smaller questions which concerned the quinque pedes of the Lex Mamilia (the law setting which boundary spaces were not subject to <b>usucapio),</b> as appears from Frontinus.|$|E
50|$|To {{deny the}} owner {{the right of}} vindicatio against the good faith {{possessor}} would run contrary {{to the concept of}} the <b>usucapio,</b> with it effectively completed before the required time had passed. In the case of the bonitary owner, the Praetor provided a defence to the vindicatio {{if there had been a}} transfer (improper or not). It was typical of the Praetor to ignore technical formalities to achieve practical benefits, in this case certainty of ownership.|$|E
5000|$|Iusta causa (alternatively [...] "iustus titulus") is a requirement, in essence, {{that the}} {{transfer}} {{would have been}} valid if not {{for one of the}} two cases mentioned above. This will be a recognised method of transfer [...] - [...] for example, gift or sale. This has to be in fact; it cannot rest on a mistaken belief in there being a sale or gift, which is the main difference between iusta causa and good faith in practice. Good faith is not easily defined, despite being a common concept in the Roman law. In the case of sale by a non-owner (or another defect in title), then it probably meant that the claimant believed he was becoming owner. However, the receiver of a res mancipi by traditio must surely realise the problem, but this does not prevent <b>usucapio.</b> The burden of proof was on anyone disputing the <b>usucapio</b> to show bad faith. The bad faith had to be shown at the point of the iusta causa [...] - [...] it was insufficient to show that the claimant later realised that the item had come from a non-owner.|$|E
5000|$|Something {{that had}} {{at any point}} been stolen (furtum) or taken by force could not be usacapted. Furtum was much wider than theft in the modern {{criminal}} law (furtum was a civil action), involving most sorts of bad faith interference in another's property. This had the practical effect of extending the good faith requirement to the transferor {{as well as the}} transferee [...] - [...] for someone who sold, gifted or otherwise transferred the property of another in bad faith committed furtum. Indeed, that the transferor is a non-owner in fact means normally that at some point there has been furtum. Gaius, in book two of The Institutes gives two counter-examples: firstly, where a borrower has died, and his heir believes the thing to be part of his interitance and sells it; secondly, where a man with a usufruct over a slave woman, ignorant of the law, wrongly believes the child to be his and sells it. Land could not be stolen, but it could certainly be taken by force. In either case (theft or force) it is only if the owner from whom it has been stolen regains it, or considers it lost forever (i.e. abandons it), that a valid <b>usucapio</b> can take place. Given this strict limitation, <b>usucapio</b> must surely only have been about shifting the burden of proof to the claimant from the possessor, whose possession was usually easy to show. However, it remains a departure from usual Roman ideas of ownership.|$|E
50|$|In Roman law, <b>usucapio</b> laws allowed {{someone who}} was in {{possession}} of a good without title to become the lawful proprietor if the original owner didn't show up after some time (one or two years), unless the good was obtained illegally (by theft or force).

5000|$|The {{two cases}} where <b>usucapio</b> {{could be said}} to create two classes of people [...] - [...] the [...] "bonitary owner" [...] where formalities have not been {{complied}} with, and the [...] "good faith possessor" [...] where, for example, the seller is not the owner. Under statute, neither class of persons had any more protection than a mere possessor. As such, their claim lay solely against their immediate dis-possessor, and were without an action against any further dis-possessors. The Praetor granted them further protection, probably in the late Republic. The bonitary owner was protected against anyone, the good faith possessor was protected with regards to everyone except the owner.|$|E
5000|$|The {{required}} {{period of}} time was only one year for movables and two years for land. Res universitas, groups of things such as an inheritance which may include both movables and land, also came under the one year rule. This is widely attributed {{to the time of}} the Twelve Tables, including by Cicero. The requirement of extended possession {{is believed to have been}} originally the only requirement, although certain types of things were exempt. These included stolen things, the res mancipi under another's guardianship, and limes [...] - [...] five-foot strips required between adjoining land holdings. The time period would have formed the prohibitive part in early Rome, where the community was sufficiently small that the owner could easily identify and regain his goods [...] - [...] considering also that if they had been stolen, they could not be usucapted. <b>Usucapio</b> would therefore have been restricted in most cases to informal conveyance of res mancipi. As Rome grew, however, it became more and more likely that the owner would be away for a year or more. The Praetor extended the rules of possession to new cases, which came to form a central part of usucapio: for example, the case of the inheritor believing that formerly borrowed goods are part of his inheritance.|$|E
