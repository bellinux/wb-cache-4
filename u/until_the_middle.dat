5|$|Florida {{experienced}} a prolonged drought {{at the onset}} of the Early Archaic era that lasted <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Archaic period. Although the population decreased overall on the peninsula, the use of tools increased significantly during this time. Artifacts demonstrate that these people used drills, knives, choppers, atlatls, and awls made from stone, antlers, and bone.|$|E

5|$|Heavy cavalry was {{believed}} to have been developed by the Ancient Persians, although others argue for the Sarmatians. By the time of Darius (558486 BC), Persian military tactics required horses and riders that were completely armoured, and selectively bred a heavier, more muscled horse to carry the additional weight. The cataphract was a type of heavily armoured cavalry with distinct tactics, armour, and weaponry used {{from the time of the}} Persians up <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages.|$|E
5|$|Unas' funerary cult {{appears to}} have survived during the chaotic First Intermediate Period <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Kingdom. By {{the time of the}} 12th Dynasty (c. 1990c. 1800 BC), the lector-priest Unasemsaf and his family were {{involved}} in the cult of Unas. In spite of this, Unas' funerary complex was partially dismantled and its materials reemployed for the construction of Amenemhat I and Senusret I own pyramid complexes.|$|E

5|$|A Roman bath {{house and}} Edwardian folly {{in the village}} of Whitestaunton were {{excavated}} by the archaeological television programme Time Team. There is also evidence of iron workings in the Romano-British period, at Dunkeswell, which radiocarbon dating has placed in the 2nd century. It has been suggested that these and other iron-based technologies gave the hills a fairly industrial landscape during the Romano-British period, providing a source of the name Blackdown Hills. Local iron ores were smelted at Hemyock in small bloomeries (furnaces) to produce pure iron <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages.|$|E
5|$|All {{bodies were}} in similar flexed {{positions}} lying on their left sides with knees raised up towards their chin. In comparison, most bodies excavated from Egypt {{dating to the}} predynastic period are in a similar position, however at Merimda Beni Salama and El-Amra bodies were found on their right sides. From the time these bodies were buried up <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Kingdom period, the dead were laid on their sides. After this period they were buried on their backs (dorsal position), and from the Fifth Dynasty the bodies were always fully extended.|$|E

5|$|As {{the first}} group of Chinese people to settle in large numbers, the Hokkien of {{southern}} Fujian became the dominant immigrant group <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 19th century. Their maritime-mercantile culture comes from their trade occupations whilst in Indonesia. Descendants of Hokkiens are the dominant group in eastern Indonesia, Central and East Java, and the western coast of Sumatra. Teochews, southern neighbors of the Hokkien, are found throughout the eastern coast of Sumatra, in the Riau Archipelago, and in western Borneo. They were preferred as plantation laborers in Sumatra, but have become traders in regions where the Hokkien are not well represented.|$|E
5|$|Because White did {{not officially}} depart Minnesota <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> {{of his second}} semester, he was academically ineligible to receive a {{scholarship}} from any Division I school in 2010. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) usually requires a two semester residency for transfers. He transferred to Iowa State prior to using any of his athletic eligibility at Minnesota and applied to the NCAA for a waiver to be eligible to play during the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, but the NCAA denied his waiver. Iowa State appealed the decision, but their appeal was denied.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of November 1846, the settlers had reached the Sierra Nevada where they became trapped by an early, heavy snowfall near Truckee (now Donner) Lake, high in the mountains. Their food supplies ran extremely low and, in mid-December, some of the group set out on foot to obtain help. Rescuers from California attempted to reach the settlers, but the first relief party did not arrive <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of February 1847, almost {{four months after the}} wagon train had become trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived to reach California, many of them having eaten the dead for survival.|$|E

5|$|Cowes Castle, {{also known}} as West Cowes Castle, is a Device Fort in Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Originally built by Henry VIII in 1539 to protect England against the threat of {{invasion}} from France and the Holy Roman Empire, it comprised a circular bastion, flanking wings and a keep, and in 1547 it housed 17 pieces of artillery. With its companion fortification at East Cowes, the castle overlooked {{the entrance to the}} River Medina, an important anchorage. The invasion threat passed but the fortification continued in use <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 19th century, very briefly seeing action in 1642 during the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Edwin's realm {{was divided}} at his death. He was succeeded by Osric, son of Edwin's {{paternal}} uncle Ælfric, in Deira, and by Eanfrith, son of Æthelfrith and Edwin's sister Acha, in Bernicia. Both reverted to paganism, {{and both were}} killed by Cadwallon; eventually Eanfrith's brother Oswald defeated and killed Cadwallon and united Northumbria once more. Thereafter, {{with the exception of}} Oswine son of Osric, power in Northumbria was {{in the hands of the}} Idings, the descendants of Ida of Bernicia, <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|General de Kalb's forces took {{almost a}} month to descend the Chesapeake Bay and did not arrive in Petersburg, Virginia <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of June, {{almost a month}} after Lincoln had {{surrendered}} his army. The Continental Congress appointed Horatio Gates to command the Southern Department. He assumed command on July 25, 1780 and immediately marched into South Carolina {{with the intent of}} engaging the British Army, now under the command of Charles Cornwallis. Williams served as Deputy Adjutant-General under Gates.|$|E

50|$|The nasal helmet was a type {{of combat}} helmet characterised by the {{possession}} of a projecting bar covering the nose and thus protecting {{the centre of the}} face; it was of Western European origins and was used from <b>the</b> Early <b>Middle</b> Ages <b>until</b> <b>the</b> High <b>Middle</b> Ages.|$|R
5|$|However, {{war with}} England {{continued}} {{for several decades}} {{after the death of}} Bruce. A civil war between the Bruce dynasty and their long-term Comyn-Balliol rivals lasted <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 14th century. Although the Bruce dynasty was successful, David II's lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew Robert II to come to the throne and establish the Stewart Dynasty. The Stewarts ruled Scotland {{for the remainder of the}} Middle Ages. The country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the Scottish Renaissance to the Reformation. This was despite continual warfare with England, the increasing division between Highlands and Lowlands, and a large number of royal minorities.|$|E
5|$|In the 17thcentury, Aarhus {{entered a}} period of {{recession}} as it suffered blockades and bombardments during the Swedish wars and trade was dampened by the preferential treatment of the capital by the state. It was not <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 18thcentury growth returned in large part due to trade with the large agricultural catchment areas around the city; particularly grain {{proved to be a}} remunerative export. The first factories were established at this time as the industrial revolution reached the country and in 1810 the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} mouse embryo, cytoplasmic {{polyadenylation}} of maternal RNAs from the egg cell allows the cell {{to survive and}} grow even though transcription does not start <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 2-cell stage (4-cell stage in human). In the brain, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is active during learning and could {{play a role in}} long-term potentiation, which is the strengthening of the signal transmission from a nerve cell to another in response to nerve impulses and is important for learning and memory formation.|$|E
50|$|Caseidae is an extinct {{family of}} synapsids from the Carboniferous and Permian period.
