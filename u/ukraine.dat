5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, residents of the Donbass were generally in favour of stronger ties with Russia, in contrast to the rest of <b>Ukraine.</b> A 1993 strike by miners in the region called for a federal <b>Ukraine</b> and economic autonomy for Donbass. This was followed by a 1994 consultative referendum on various constitutional questions in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, held concurrently with the first parliamentary elections in independent <b>Ukraine.</b> These questions included whether Russian should be enshrined as an official language of <b>Ukraine,</b> whether Russian should be the language of administration in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, whether <b>Ukraine</b> should federalise, and whether <b>Ukraine</b> should have closer ties with the Commonwealth of Independent States. Close to 90% of voters voted in favour of these propositions. None of them were adopted: <b>Ukraine</b> remained a unitary state, Ukrainian was retained as the sole official language, and the Donbass gained no autonomy.|$|E

5|$|Khrushchev {{sought to}} {{reconstruct}} <b>Ukraine,</b> but also desired {{to complete the}} interrupted work of imposing the Soviet system on it, though he hoped that the purges of the 1930s would not recur. As <b>Ukraine</b> was recovered militarily, conscription was imposed, and 750,000men aged between nineteen and fifty were given minimal military training and sent to join the Red Army. Other Ukrainians joined partisan forces, seeking an independent <b>Ukraine.</b> Khrushchev rushed from district to district through <b>Ukraine,</b> urging the depleted labor force to greater efforts. He made a short visit to his birthplace of Kalinovka, finding a starving population, with {{only a third of}} the men who had joined the Red Army having returned. Khrushchev did what he could to assist his hometown. Despite Khrushchev's efforts, in 1945, Ukrainian industry was at only a quarter of pre-war levels, and the harvest actually dropped from that of 1944, when the entire territory of <b>Ukraine</b> had not yet been retaken.|$|E

5|$|Tensions {{between the}} EEU and the European Union (EU) {{occurred}} as both {{have sought to}} deepen their ties with several former Soviet republics. The EU has signed free trade agreements with <b>Ukraine,</b> Moldova and Georgia. However, separatists in all three countries back closer ties with Russia. Russia and the EU both pressured <b>Ukraine</b> to join their respective economic blocs {{to the exclusion of}} the other, which ultimately led to <b>Ukraine</b> being torn in two, with the EU supporting the unwilling departure of the elected president, and Russia then annexing the Crimean peninsula (following a referendum) and supporting separatists in Eastern <b>Ukraine.</b> In response, some member states of the European Union have sought to find alternatives to Russian gas, while others have voiced their support for the construction of the South Stream pipeline which circumvents <b>Ukraine.</b> Later the already started construction of the pipeline, under US sanctions on Russia and pressure on EU, the project was abandoned. Analysts believe Russia backs the Eurasian Economic Union in order to limit western influence in the region.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ukraine</b> {{submitted}} {{an application}} {{to participate in}} the Eurasian Economic Union as an observer in August 2013.

The country's membership in the EEU was seen by some analysts as the key {{to the success of the}} union as <b>Ukraine</b> has the second largest economy of any of the 15 former republics of the Soviet Union.

5|$|Ukrainian {{independence}} {{was confirmed by}} a referendum held on 1 December 1991. In this referendum, 54% of Crimean voters supported independence from the Soviet Union. This {{was followed by a}} 1992 vote by the Crimean parliament to hold a referendum on independence from <b>Ukraine,</b> which spawned a two-year crisis over the status of Crimea. At the same time, the Supreme Soviet of Russia voted to void the cession of Crimea to <b>Ukraine.</b> In June of the same year, the Ukrainian government in Kiev voted to give Crimea a large amount autonomy as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea within <b>Ukraine.</b> Despite this, fighting between the Crimean government, Russian government, and Ukrainian government continued. In 1994, Russian nationalist Yuri Meshkov won the 1994 Crimean presidential election, and implemented the earlier approved referendum on the status of Crimea. 1.3 million people voted in this referendum, 78.4% of whom supported greater autonomy from <b>Ukraine,</b> whilst 82.8% supported allowing dual Russian-Ukrainian citizenship. Later in that same year, the status of Crimea as part of <b>Ukraine</b> was recognised by Russia, which pledged to uphold the territorial integrity of <b>Ukraine</b> in the Budapest Memorandum. This treaty was also signed by the United States, United Kingdom, and France. <b>Ukraine</b> revoked the Constitution of Crimea and abolished the office of President of Crimea in 1995. Crimea was granted a new constitution in 1998, which granted lesser autonomy than the previous one. Crimean officials would later seek to restore the powers of the previous constitution. Throughout the 1990s, many Crimean Tatar deportees and their descendants returned to Crimea.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} social, cultural, ethnic, and {{linguistic}} factors {{contributed to the}} sparking of unrest in eastern and southern <b>Ukraine</b> {{in the aftermath of}} the early 2014 revolution in <b>Ukraine.</b> Following Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, resurfacing historical and cultural divisions and a weak state structure hampered the development of a unified Ukrainian national identity. In eastern and southern <b>Ukraine,</b> Russification and ethnic Russian settlement during centuries of Russian rule caused the Russian language to attain primacy, even amongst ethnic Ukrainians. In Crimea, ethnic Russians have comprised the majority of the population since the deportation of the indigenous Crimean Tatars by Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin following the Second World War. This contrasts with western and central <b>Ukraine,</b> which were historically ruled by a variety of powers, such as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Austrian Empire. In these areas, the Ukrainian ethnic, national, and linguistic identity remained intact.|$|E
