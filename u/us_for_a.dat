5|$|During her {{childhood}} in Jakarta, Ng enjoyed reading and read at an advanced rate. After finishing her {{primary and secondary}} education in Indonesia, during which time she took up writing, Ng went to the United States to study at Ohio State University. After her graduation in 1997, she worked in the <b>US</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year before returning to Indonesia {{to work at a}} shipping company. After three years working there, in which time she married and had two miscarriages, Ng quit to become a professional writer. Her first novel, Tujuh Musim Setahun (Seven Seasons in a Year; 2002), sold poorly, but her subsequent trilogy Indiana Chronicle was better received. Since then, she has released several novels, as well as numerous short stories (including one anthology) and twenty-one children's books, and some collections of fairytales.|$|E
5|$|John Wilson (1847) {{writes that}} the tomb lies {{about two or three}} hundred yards to the north of Jacob's Well, across the valley. He {{describes}} it as 'a small solid erection {{in the form of a}} wagon roof, over what is supposed to be the patriarch’s grave, with a small pillar or altar at each of its extremities, sometimes called the tombs of Ephraim and Manasseh, and the middle of an enclosure without a covering. Many visitors names, in the Hebrew and Samaritan characters, are written on the walls of this enclosure.' One of the inscriptions is said to intimate the tomb's repair by a Jew from Egypt, Elijah son of Meir, around 1749. Wilson adds that 'The Jews of Nablus take upon themselves the duty of keeping the tomb in order. They applied to <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> subscription to aid in making some repairs and we complied with their request'. These Hebrew and Samaritan inscriptions were still visible on the white plastered walls as late as 1980, as were small lamps in an internal recess, probably donated by Jews during the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, Dr. Humberto Alvarez-Machain, a Mexican national, {{allegedly}} {{assisted in}} the torture and murder of a U.S. DEA agent in Mexico. Notwithstanding that the U.S had an extradition treaty with Mexico (and because the Mexican government declined to extradite a Mexican national to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> crime allegedly committed in Mexico), the U.S. Government hired a private citizen and some Mexican nationals to essentially act as mercenaries, who then went into Mexico, kidnapped Dr. Alvarez-Machain, and {{brought him back to}} the U.S. for trial for the crime committed in Mexico. The trial court ruled that since Alvarez-Machain had been brought to the U.S. in violation of the treaty, his arrest was unlawful. The United States Supreme Court, in United States v. Alvarez-Machain, ruled that notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty with Mexico, it was still legal for the U.S. government to exercise self-help and essentially grab him off the street in Mexico ("forcible abduction") to bring him back to the U.S. for trial. In Alvarez-Machain's subsequent criminal trial, he was acquitted, and he lost a civil suit he filed for false arrest against the government.|$|E
