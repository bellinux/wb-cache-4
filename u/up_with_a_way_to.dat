5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require {{so much to be}} excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was {{not in the business of}} making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E

The NTSB also issued a call to pro-trucking bodies to educate their members about the dangers associated with truckers’ use of synthetic drugs, and to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> prevent their use while behind the wheel.|$|E
25|$|Boron and Graphite rods {{came around}} in the 1960s and 1970s when the United States and United Kingdom {{invested}} considerable research into developing the new technologies. Hewitt and Howald {{were the first to}} come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> lay the fibers into the shape of a fishing rod by wrapping them around a piece of balsa wood. However, by 1977, boron fibre technology had been muscled out by the cheaper material graphite and was no longer competitive in the market.|$|E

500|$|As Edgeworth {{had been}} a popular {{character}} ever since start of the series, Takumi {{found it difficult to}} come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> bring him back without having him, a supposedly great prosecutor, always lose to Phoenix. While he was writing the story for the game's final case, he thought of the idea to have Edgeworth become a player character; he liked this idea so much that he immediately started to rewrite the case. In order to allow Edgeworth to be the player character, {{the first thing he did}} was to [...] "get rid of" [...] Phoenix by having him fall from a bridge into an icy river. He enjoyed writing from another character's perspective, who thought differently from Phoenix; he also used the case to explore the relationship between Edgeworth and Gumshoe. One of the game's episodes had originally been written for Justice for All: it had been intended as the fourth episode of Justice for All, but was cut due to memory limiations, and ended up being reused as the third episode of Trials and Tribulations.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) and FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) {{discover}} that Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) {{has agreed to}} return with his real father, dubbed [...] "Walternate" [...] (Noble), to his own universe called the Other Side, which runs parallel to ours. One of the mysterious Observers (Michael Cerveris) leaves Olivia a note indicating that Peter is named in a prophecy as the one responsible {{for the end of}} the world. To warn Peter of his impending role, the Fringe Division work with biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> cross over. They form a plan that takes advantage of Olivia's universe-hopping ability, and recruit three other Cortexiphan test subjects who have unique abilities: Nick Lane (David Call), Sally Clark (Pascale Hutton), and James Heath (Omar Metwally), two of whom appeared in previous episodes. The team—composed of Walter, Olivia, Nick, Sally, and James—successfully arrives on the Other Side. James dies shortly after arrival, but the rest manage to escape the alternate reality's Fringe Division, who had used their special technology to detect their arrival. It is revealed that Walternate is the Secretary of Defense on the Other Side.|$|E
500|$|Alan Resnick (portrayed by himself), an {{emerging}} young tech expert and innovator, is {{introduced to the}} viewer. He tells the audience of his four-step program to create a digital avatar {{that acts as a}} backup of its host, granting [...] "the secret to eternal life". He tells the audience of his past: two years ago, Resnick was banished to his couch after getting into a lovers' spat with his wife, Janet. He dreamt of himself in a foggy meadow with an attractive, nude young woman (portrayed by [...] "MKNZ") who calls for him to engage in sex. He initially refuses, but then changes his mind, but before they are able to do so, he is shot with a gun by a nameless man (Ben O'Brien), which totally destroys his face. This gave him the idea to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> digitally back himself up. Two months pass, and he is able to create an [...] "exact digital copy" [...] of himself who calls himself [...] "Teddy" [...] (for unknown reasons). [...] "Teddy", a floating avatar head, acts as the co-host {{for the remainder of the}} program, often interrupting Resnick's speech to talk about his [...] "wife".|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{commercial}} American {{cream cheese}} {{was developed in}} 1872, when William Lawrence, from Chester, New York, while looking for <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to recreate the soft, French cheese Neufchâtel, accidentally came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of making <b>an</b> [...] "unripened cheese" [...] that is heavier and creamier; other dairymen came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> similar creations independently.|$|R

500|$|In 2007, Tarantino {{discussed}} an {{idea for}} a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South. He called this type of film [...] "a southern", stating that he wanted [...] "to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to." [...] Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: [...] "I was writing a book about Sergio Corbucci when I came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> tell the story.... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with fascism. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [...] while he was doing this. But I know I'm thinking it now. And I can do it!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Lonsdale's {{employer}} and landlord received {{phone calls from}} Scientology representatives who claimed {{that he was a}} religious bigot and dangerous. Lonsdale was subpoenaed by the Church of Scientology for a deposition in the fall of 2006, and the Church claimed that he belonged to an anti-Scientology group which had previously been barred from protesting in certain areas in downtown Clearwater, the Lisa McPherson Trust. Luke Lirot, the lawyer who defended Lonsdale in the matter, told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "I found him to be quite affable and truly a very intelligent man ... I certainly hope that a very thorough investigation is conducted." [...] In his deposition, Lonsdale stated he was unemployed and began to educate himself about Scientology while working on a photography project on homeless people in Clearwater. After reading more about Scientology, he decided to shed light on the organization and irritate Scientologists. Of the claims Scientology made that Lonsdale was affiliated with the Lisa McPherson Trust, Lirot commented: [...] "It was obvious to everybody {{he had nothing to do}} with the trust, and the trust had been disbanded and dissolved many years prior ... They just wanted to try to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> preclude him from exercising his right to picket in downtown Clearwater, and they were unsuccessful in doing that." ...|$|E
500|$|Gard was keen to animate the {{character}} realistically, an aspect {{he felt the}} industry at the time had disregarded. He sacrificed quick animations in favour of more fluid movement, believing that players would empathise with {{the character}} more easily. Lara's dual-wielding of pistols {{was inspired by the}} film Hard Boiled and an Æon Flux short. In the first Tomb Raider, Croft's three-dimensional (3D) character model is made of around 230polygons. The character's braid was removed from the model, but added back for subsequent iterations. Gavin Rummery, programmer on the first two Tomb Raider games, explained, [...] "It had been dropped from the original because it just didn't work properly with all the acrobatic moves – it was more like she had an electric eel attached to her head that had a life of its own. But on TRII I came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get it working and was really pleased how natural it looked." [...] There is a misconception that, while adjusting the character model, Gard accidentally increased the breasts' dimensions by 150 percent {{and the rest of the}} creative team argued to keep the change. Gard, however, has stated thasich notion [...] "came out of a silly remark made in an interview". Core Design hired Shelley Blond to voice Croft after the game entered the beta phase of development. Gard left Core Design after completing Tomb Raider, citing a lack of creative freedom and control over marketing decisions related to the ideas he developed (especially Lara Croft).|$|E

50|$|He {{discovered}} <b>a</b> <b>way</b> {{of interpreting}} quantum states as information. He came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of compressing {{the information in}} a state, and storing the information in {{a smaller number of}} states. This is now known as Schumacher compression. This was the quantum analog of Shannon's noiseless coding theorem, and it helped to start the field known as quantum information theory.|$|R
500|$|Another {{example of}} the {{inductive}} composition method {{was the creation of}} the game's title, which was only decided on after the story was completed. It was meant to reflect how the game's story connects the future and the past, with the word [...] "ever" [...] intended to be read with two meanings: [...] "once before" [...] and [...] "someday", but the number [...] "17" [...] was initially simply chosen as Uchikoshi liked the number due to being born on the 17th, and because he liked the transition to [...] "17" [...] from the [...] "7" [...] in Never 7; upon checking the calendar for year spans where dates and days of the week would line up, he found that one such occurrence was the seventeen years between 2017 and 2034; other spans included eleven years, which was too short, and twenty-eight, which was too long. When Uchikoshi considered how to bring characters over from 2017 to 2034, some worked out naturally: Tsugumi was immortal due to being infected with the Curé Virus, You had a clone in 2034, and Sora was an artificial intelligence. He could not come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make Coco and Sara appear in both 2017 and 2034, but thought that the player probably would not figure it out just from this discrepancy. The one character left was Kaburaki, who would be a teenager in 2017 but in his 30s in 2034; Uchikoshi solved this by infecting him with the Curé Virus, which then led to him making the rest of the 2017 cast infected as well.|$|E
2500|$|A {{slot machine}} is a casino {{gambling}} machine. Due {{to the vast}} number of possible wins with the original poker card based game, it proved practically impossible to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make a machine capable of making an automatic pay-out for all possible winning combinations. The first [...] "one-armed bandit" [...] was invented in 1887 by Charles Fey of San Francisco, California who devised a simple automatic mechanism with three spinning reels containing {{a total of five}} symbols– horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts and a Liberty Bell, which also gave the machine its name.|$|E

2500|$|The 2007 Louis Vuitton Cup started {{slowly with}} all races {{postponed}} {{for the first}} four days of competition due to light and variable winds. There were rumors that BMW Oracle was planning on rotating the crew off the boat because they were running out of stories to tell as they sat in the boat waiting for wind. To entertain fans, some teams came up with interesting stunts. For instance, United Internet Germany came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> wakeboard, by having their largest sail trimmers pull on the wakeboarder using the jib trimming system. [...] +39, an Italian challenger, used the windless days off to continue making repairs to their mast, which shattered in a starboard-port situation with Internet Team Germany two weeks earlier, and completed mast repairs by the time racing had commenced.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{records were}} the [...] "standard" [...] 3minute version until Tom Moulton came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make songs longer. Moulton {{wanted to make}} longer songs, {{so that he could}} take a crowd of dancers at a club to another level and keep them dancing longer. He found that was {{impossible}} to make the 45-RPM vinyl discs of the time longer, as they could usually hold no more than 5minutes of good-quality music. With the help of José Rodriguez, his remasterer/mastering engineer, he pressed a single on a 10" [...] disc instead of 7". They cut the next single on a 12" [...] disc, the same format as a standard album. Moulton and Rodriguez discovered that these larger records could have much longer songs and remixes. Twelve-inch records, even for singles, fast became the standard format for all DJs of the disco genre.|$|E
2500|$|To {{build the}} high banking, crews had to {{excavate}} {{over a million}} square yards of soil from the track's infield. Because of the high water table in the area, the excavated hole filled with water to form what {{is now known as}} Lake Lloyd, named after Joseph [...] "Sax" [...] Lloyd, one of the original six members of the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority. (The lake would be stocked with 65,000 fish, and France would arrange speedboat races on it.) 22 tons of lime mortar had to be brought in to form the track's binding base, over which asphalt would be laid. Because of the extreme degree of banking, Moneypenny had to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> pave the incline. He connected the paving equipment to bulldozers anchored {{at the top of the}} banking. This would allow the paving equipment to pave the banking without slipping or rolling down the incline. Moneypenny subsequently patented his construction method and later designed Talladega Superspeedway and Michigan International Speedway. By December 1958, France had begun to run out of money and started relying on race ticket sales to complete construction.|$|E

We will also compare this method to the brute force method which needs to know all the passages of the previous particles through the cavity...|$|R
2500|$|In his May 2014 {{interview}} with NBC News, Snowden accused the U.S. government {{of trying to}} use one position here or there in his career to distract from the totality of his experience, downplaying him as a [...] "low level analyst." [...] In his words, he was [...] "trained as a spy {{in the traditional sense}} of the word in that I lived and worked undercover overseas—pretending to work in a job that I'm not—and even being assigned a name that was not mine." [...] He said he'd worked for the NSA undercover overseas, and for the DIA had developed sources and methods to keep information and people secure [...] "in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world. So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading."
