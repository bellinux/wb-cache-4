40|$|The {{most common}} {{accounting}} methods {{for oil and}} gas <b>upstream</b> <b>activities</b> are full cost (Fe) and successful efforts (SE) methods. However, Libyan accounting practice differs from these two methods. Oil and gas companies in Libya are permitted by Libyan Petroleum Law (LPL) to capitalise or expense several types of costs, whereas these costs are specified to be capitalised or expensed under the Fe and SE methods. Thus, discretion exists between accounting methods in global accounting practice, whereas in Libyan accounting practice it exists amongst the method where the choice is permitted. This thesis seeks to point out three issues. Firstly, it seeks to find out the accounting practice of oil and gas <b>upstream</b> <b>activities</b> in Libya under LPL, especially for the costs which are under the capital or expense choice and considers consistency for the international oil and gas companies (IOCs) when they report to Libyan authorities and their holding companies. Secondly, it seeks to understand the stakeholders' perceptions regarding accounting {{for oil and gas}} <b>upstream</b> <b>activities</b> in Libya, and also report the role of the Libyan stakeholders regarding oil and gas <b>upstream</b> <b>activities.</b> Thirdly, it seeks to find out the fiscal impact in Libya of using the Fe, SE and LPL methods to treat the costs of oil and gas <b>upstream</b> <b>activities.</b> The thesis applies stakeholder and agency theories as theoretical frameworks. Stakeholder theory assists in attempting to develop a stakeholder model regarding accounting for oil and gas <b>upstream</b> <b>activities</b> in Libya. Agency theory attempts to consider the relationship between IOCs as agents and the Libyan government as principal. Furthermore, the thesis applies qualitative and quantitative methodologies as an approach for the study. The results indicate that an inconsistency issue exists when IOCs report to Libyan authorities and their holding companies. Furthermore, they show that {{there is a lack of}} involvement of Libyan stakeholders regarding accounting for oil and gas <b>upstream</b> <b>activities.</b> In addition, the results point out the fiscal impact of using different accounting methods other than LPL to treat oil and gas <b>upstream</b> <b>activities</b> with FC adopting creating a small positive impact on the Libyan economy and SE a significant negative impact on the Libyan economy.

Here we identify a new nuclear protein, NP 60, which regulates the {{activation of}} p 38 alpha {{in response to}} sorbitol treatment.

40|$|An {{idealized}} dry {{primitive equation}} model on the f-plane {{is used to}} study upstream (and downstream) baroclinic wave development. The simulations are initiated with localized finite amplitude and vertically evanescent perturbations, specified either as upper-level potential vorti-city or surface potential temperature anomalies. The nonlinear evolution of these nonmodal perturbations leads to the generation of large-scale upper-level induced primary and down-stream surface cyclones, and of distinctively smaller, shallow and more slowly intensifying upstream systems. It is shown that in particular the genesis and evolution of upstream cyclones is highly sensitive to {{the scale of the}} initial perturbation. Narrow upper-level troughs (or zonally confined surface temperature anomalies) are favorable for upstream development, whereas no or only weak <b>upstream</b> <b>activity</b> occurs with broad planetary-scale troughs (or zonally extended surface temperature anomalies) as initial perturbations. It is proposed that this sensitivity prop-erty of upstream development is qualitatively related to the dispersion characteristics of surface edge waves.

40|$|First {{published}} online on 8 September 2011. This paper {{addresses the}} effectiveness of auctions and legal unbundling as regulatory measures to tender a vertically integrated industry more competitive. Specifically, I analyze if implementing auctions and legal unbundling can counter market power in an industry where a Vertically Integrated Corporation (VIC) has a monopoly position in an essential, scarce <b>upstream</b> <b>activity</b> and also owns one of the firms active in the competitive downstream activity. In an earlier paper, Van Koten (2011), I showed that in this configuration the VIC, by having its downstream firm bid more aggressively, can—through increased auction revenue—increase its profit, while disadvantaging downstream competitors and lowering efficiency. Here I analyze the regulatory measure of also legally separating the downstream firm from the VIC. I show that such a measure may only be partially effective; the VIC can formulate a simple compensation scheme that does not violate restrictions typically imposed by legal separation but induces {{the manager of the}} VIC-owned downstream firm to bid more aggressively. This increases the profits of the VIC, decreases efficiency, and disadvantages downstream competitors...|$|E
