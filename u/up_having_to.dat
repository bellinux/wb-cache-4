5|$|All {{that changed}} with the {{assassination}} of Tsar Alexander II. The mourning for the tsar meant {{there would be no}} performances in the capital; in addition the political climate of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden's troupe soldiered on for a time—to Minsk, to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where he and Sonya ended <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> sue Goldfaden for their pay, and left to rejoin Rosenberg, who was playing in a tent theater in Nezhin. However, matters there proved even worse: Nezhin soon fell prey to a pogrom. The troupe managed to avoid bodily harm, partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.|$|E
5|$|The writing team {{included}} Nakazawa, {{who wrote}} You's route and the Kid's common route; Nakazawa's assistant Kitaro Sasanari, who wrote Tsugumi and Sora's routes; Nobuaki Umeda; and Uchikoshi, who wrote Coco's route. The writing process for all routes were supervised by Uchikoshi, {{in an effort}} to eliminate inconsistencies in the setting or characters, and plot holes between the different parts of the story. Because he was running out of time at the end, he had to rush the writing of the end of Coco's route, which he described as possibly his only regret with the game. Nakazawa wrote his parts in between his directorial work, such as writing specification documents, supervising the production, and doing quality control work; {{due to the lack of}} time, he ended <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> stay overnight at KID everyday and work through the night, something he said was only possible because of how young he was at the time. Nakazawa described himself as working particularly hard on the game because he felt bitter that Never 7 had not sold particularly well.|$|E

25|$|The {{long-term}} {{plans for}} The Baseball Network crumbled when the Major League Baseball Players' Association {{went on strike}} on August 12, 1994 (thus forcing the cancellation of the World Series).

Both networks figured that as the delayed 1995 baseball season opened without a labor agreement, there was no guarantee against another strike. Both networks soon publicly vowed to cut all ties with Major League Baseball {{for the remainder of the}} 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Washington {{narrowed the}} score to 19–13 {{in the fourth}} quarter. With about 11 minutes to go, Jeff Garcia {{returned}} to the game, hoping to spark Tampa Bay's offense, and hold on for the win. He was unable to do much against the Redskins' well-rested and fired up defense, however, and Tampa Bay ended <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> punt. Josh Bidwell pinned the Redskins at their own 9-yard line, and Campbell drove them to the Tampa Bay 32-yard line. Ronde Barber stopped the threat when he intercepted the ball at the 28-yard line. With {{less than a minute}} to go, Campbell drove the Redskins to the Tampa Bay 16-yard line, but Brian Kelly intercepted the pass in the end zone with 17 seconds remaining, to clinch the victory for the Buccaneers.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few drug therapies that are {{possible}} for Parkinson's disease (ex. Sinemet). Since there is no cure for it, the patient will probably end <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> have surgery done to relieve some of the symptoms. When a patient has this procedure done, they are most likely going to receive a deep brain stimulation. So it will keep the brain stimulated even though the disease tries to disable it. Recently a study was performed to test if surgery helps the patients discover their symptoms post surgery than pre-surgery. They found that the symptoms were still present but the patients were more aware of their difficulties than before they had surgery. This shows that surgery does improve a patients speech perception, even though it might not cure their disease.|$|E
25|$|The Texans ended <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> {{wait until}} Week 5 against the Indianapolis Colts {{to have their}} home opener, the latest an NFL team went into the season before playing at home since the New Orleans Saints played their entire {{schedule}} {{on the road in}} 2005 due to the damages of the city of New Orleans as a result of Hurricane Katrina. (Every other NFL team had at least one home game by the end of Week 2.) With the Ravens eventually advancing to the AFC Championship Game against the rival Pittsburgh Steelers (and having to enter the playoffs as a wild card team), the impromptu decision to give the Ravens and Texans their bye week so early in the season ended up having the unintended effect of the Ravens playing in an NFL-record 18 consecutive weeks without a break in the schedule.|$|E

Meanwhile, Olivia kidnaps Sam to threaten Julian, but Sam tries to escape. Unfortunately, in the ensuing struggle, Sam gets pushed off a bridge by Olivia into a ravine. Jason tries to track down Sam after realizing she's missing, but is unable {{to see her in}} the dark. Just as Jason gives up, a beam of moonlight helps him find Sam after the moon comes out. Jason gets to Sam, who is already in labor, and ends <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> deliver their baby girl. He gets them to the hospital, where Sam ends up in a coma after surgery. Jason begs her to wake up, saying he can't go on without her. Alexis brings their newborn daughter to visit Sam. When Jason lays the baby on Sam's chest, Sam wakes up and recovers. She and Jason name their daughter Emily Scout Morgan.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Elway's {{completions}} to Steve Sewell and Steve Watson for gains of 39 and 21 yards propelled the team on {{a drive to}} the Patriots 4-yard line. From there, Elway tried to run the ball for a score, but was tackled {{just short of the}} end zone. Believing he had crossed the plain, Elway angrily spiked the ball into the ground, drawing a penalty that pushed the team back five yards and they ended <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> settle for Rich Karlis' field goal to go up 3-0. In the second quarter, the Patriots took the lead when Eason completed a 19-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Stanley Morgan to cap an 87-yard drive. However, the Broncos countered with an 82-yard drive to score on Elway's 22-yard touchdown run. Later in the second quarter, New England linebacker Johnny Rembert's interception of an Elway pass on the Broncos 29-yard line led to Tony Franklin's 38-yard field goal, tying the game at 10 {{by the end of the}} half.|$|E
25|$|Williams' {{third and}} final year on the show is {{considered}} a high point in terms of ratings and stories for the entire series. However it proved even more difficult for Williams behind the scenes, as he found Tom Baker increasingly hard to cope with. The most watched episode ever of Doctor Who was part 4 of City of Death (by Fisher, Adams, and Williams) which drew 16.1 Million people. Douglas Adams became script editor and his distinctive style {{can be seen in}} the dialogue and stories. For example, in Destiny of the Daleks, Adams included a scene of the Doctor trapped under a boulder that resembles a similar scene in the second series of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. His time as script editor was beset by problems; Adams often ended <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> greatly edit and even rewrite stories. Once again, facing burnout and lack of funds, Adams eventually agreed to write the final story Shada. Production proved difficult and ended up being unfinished due to a strike at the BBC. Williams left the show, dissatisfied with having left on what he considered to be a low note.|$|E

25|$|In early May 1948, Miller was loaned out again, {{this time}} to 20th Century Fox for West of Tomorrow—her first leading lady role. The {{screenplay}} was based on William Bowers' play of the same name. During WW2 in New Guinea, a US Army Air Force squadron has been assigned to protect Australia and despite having inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese, they supernaturally had none themselves. Miller played Jean Gillis, a Broadway actress and former anti-war activist, who joined the USO after her husband's death at Dunkirk. By happenstance, she ends <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> entertain the airmen by herself when she finds {{out the rest of}} her troupe is stranded. During an improvised “dinner dance,” she learns about the pilots' wives and girlfriends and their hopes for the future, but equally learns about herself. Arthur Franz makes his film debut as Miller's love interest. The next morning, all but the squadron leader and Jean are killed after an attack on the airstrip. Similar to Death Takes a Holiday (1934), the airmen reach the epiphany of their lives in the few hours they spend with Jean. The resulting film was released as Jungle Patrol (1948), the sole film that Miller had 1st-place billing. Despite Miller's preference for Bowers' original title, the film is her personal favorite.|$|E
25|$|The young {{crown prince}} grew <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> {{live up to}} a prophecy at his birth, which claimed that he would {{grow up to be}} a great warrior just like Minye Kyawswa. (According to the prophecy, Tabinshwehti was the reincarnation of a prince named Minye Kyawswa who was put to death by his father King Dhammazedi of Hanthawaddy. The prince {{supposedly}} prayed the same prayer as Prince Bawlawkyantaw of Hanthawaddy before the latter was put to death by his father King Razadarit in 1390. As Minye Kyawswa of Ava, who was believed to be the reincarnate of Bawlawkyantaw, grew up to be the nemesis of Hanthawaddy, Tabinshwehti, believed to be the reincarnate of Minye Kyawswa of Hanthawaddy, the prophecy claimed, would be the nemesis of Hanthawaddy.) The prophecy of a Minye Kyawswa reincarnate may have been popular in the superstitious world of Burmese politics since Upper Burma was going through immense political turmoil and decades-long internecine warfare. Since the 1480s, the once dominant power of Upper Burma, Ava, had been unable to prevent its key vassal states from breaking away. His father, who himself had broken away from Ava since 1510, required his son to receive an education in military arts. Tabinshwehiti along with Ye Htut and other young men at the palace received training in martial arts, horseback riding, elephant riding, and military strategy.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Conan O'Brien and {{directed}} by Wes Archer.

500|$|After {{development}} of the original [...] was finished, the writer and director Shu Takumi's boss, Shinji Mikami, told him that they should make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case. Development of the game began immediately when Takumi returned to work from his vacation: the producer, Atsushi Inaba, called him in to a meeting, and told Takumi that he wanted him to write the script for five episodes before the game went into full production, with a deadline of {{three and a half}} months. Takumi thought that this was [...] "completely insane", as it had taken him an average of more than a month to write each of the four episodes for the first Ace Attorney; additionally, he felt {{that he did not have}} any [...] "tricks" [...] left to use for mysteries or any story threads to work off of. He wanted to protest, but still ended <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> do it. As soon as he returned to his desk, he drafted a work schedule: he scheduled two and a half month to write the dialogue, with half a month per episode, leaving him with a month to create the first prototype and figure out the [...] "tricks" [...] to be used in the mysteries. He doubted that he would be able to do it in time, but managed to write the whole script by the deadline. However, due to issues with memory on the game's cartridge, one episode ended <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> be cut from the game; it was later used as the third episode of the third game.|$|E
