60|$|Ireland {{is about}} half as large as England. In the {{temperature}} of the climate there is little difference, other than that more rain falls; as the country is more mountainous, and exposed full to the westerly wind, which, blowing from the Atlantic Ocean, prevails during the greater part of the year. This moisture, as it has enriched the country with large and frequent rivers, and spread out a number of fair and magnificent lakes beyond the proportion of other places, has on the other hand incumbered the island with an uncommon multitude of bogs and morasses; so that in general it is less praised for corn than pasturage, in which no soil is more rich and luxuriant. Whilst it possesses these internal means of wealth, it opens on all sides a great number of ports, spacious and secure, and by their advantageous situation inviting to <b>universal</b> <b>commerce.</b> But on these ports, better known than those of Britain in the time of the Romans, at this time there were few towns, scarce any fortifications, and no trade that deserves to be mentioned.|$|E
60|$|First, we went ten days' {{journey to}} Nankin, a city well worth seeing; {{they say it}} has a million of people in it: it is {{regularly}} built, and the streets are all straight, and cross one another in direct lines. But when I come to compare the miserable people of these countries with ours, their fabrics, their manner of living, their government, their religion, their wealth, and their glory, as some call it, I must confess that I scarcely think it worth my while to mention them here. We wonder at the grandeur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the government, the manufactures, the commerce, and conduct of these people; not that there is really any matter for wonder, but because, having a true notion of the barbarity of those countries, the rudeness and the ignorance that prevail there, we {{do not expect to}} find any such thing so far off. Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces and royal buildings of Europe? What their trade to the <b>universal</b> <b>commerce</b> of England, Holland, France, and Spain? What are their cities to ours, for wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and infinite variety? What are their ports, supplied with a few junks and barks, to our navigation, our merchant fleets, our large and powerful navies? Our city of London has more trade than half their mighty empire: one English, Dutch, or French man-of-war of eighty guns would be able to fight almost all the shipping belonging to China: but the greatness of their wealth, their trade, the power of their government, and the strength of their armies, may be a little surprising to us, because, as I have said, considering them as a barbarous nation of pagans, little better than savages, we did not expect such things among them. But all the forces of their empire, though they were to bring two millions of men into the field together, {{would be able to do}} nothing but ruin the country and starve themselves; a million of their foot could not stand before one embattled body of our infantry, posted so as not to be surrounded, though they were not to be one to twenty in number; nay, I do not boast if I say that thirty thousand German or English foot, and ten thousand horse, well managed, could defeat all the forces of China. Nor is there a fortified town in China that could hold out one month against the batteries and attacks of an European army. They have firearms, it is true, but they are awkward and uncertain in their going off; and their powder has but little strength. Their armies are badly disciplined, and want skill to attack, or temper to retreat; and therefore, I must confess, it seemed strange to me, when I came home, and heard our people say such fine things of the power, glory, magnificence, and trade of the Chinese; because, as far as I saw, they appeared to be a contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant, sordid slaves, subjected to a government qualified only to rule such a people; and were not its distance inconceivably, great from Muscovy, and that empire in a manner as rude, impotent, and ill governed as they, the Czar of Muscovy might with ease drive them all out of their country, and conquer them in one campaign; and had the Czar (who is now a growing prince) fallen this way, instead of attacking the warlike Swedes, and equally improved himself in the art of war, as they say he has done; and if none of the powers of Europe had envied or interrupted him, he might by this time have been Emperor of China, instead of being beaten by the King of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not one to six in number.|$|E

But the greatness of their wealth, their trade, {{the power of their}} government, and strength of their armies are surprising to us, because, as I have said, considering them as a barbarous nation of pagans, little better than savages, we did not expect such things among them; and this, indeed, is the advantage with which all their greatness and power is represented to us: otherwise, it is in itself nothing at all; for, as I have said of their ships, so it may be said of their armies and troops; all the forces of their empire, though they were to bring two millions of men into the field together, {{would be able to do}} nothing but ruin the country and starve themselves. If they were to besiege a strong town in Flanders, or to fight a disciplined army, one line of German cuirassiers, or of French cavalry, would overthrow all the horse of China; a million of their foot could not stand before one embattled body of our infantry, posted so as not to be surrounded, though they were not to be one to twenty in number: nay, I do not boast if I say, that 30,000 German or English foot, and 10,000 French horse, would fairly beat all the forces of China. And so of our fortified towns, and of the art of our engineers, in assaulting and defending towns; there is not a fortified town in China could hold out one month against the batteries and attacks of an European army; and at the same time, all the armies of China could never take such a town as Dunkirk, provided it was not starved; no, not in ten years siege. They have fire-arms, it is true, but they are awkward, clumsy, and uncertain in going off; they have powder, but it is of no strength; they have neither discipline in the field, exercise in their arms, skill to attack, nor temper to retreat. And therefore I must confess it seemed strange to me when I came home, and heard our people say such fine things of the power, riches, glory, magnificence, and trade of the Chinese, because I saw and knew that they were a contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant, sordid slaves, subjected to a government qualified only to rule such a people; and, in a word, for I am now launched quite beside my design, I say, in a word, were not its distance inconceivably great from Muscovy, and were not the Muscovite empire almost as rude, impotent, and ill-governed a crowd of slaves as they, the czar of Muscovy might, with much ease, drive them all out of their country, and conquer them in one campaign; and had the czar, who I since hear is a growing prince, and begins to appear formidable in the world, fallen this way, instead of attacking the warlike Swedes, in which attempt none of the powers of Europe would have envied or interrupted him; he might, by this time, have been emperor of China, instead of being beaten by the king of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not one to six in number. As their strength and their grandeur, so their navigation, commerce, and husbandry, are imperfect and impotent, compared to the same things in Europe. Also, in their knowledge, their learning, their skill in the sciences; they have globes and spheres, and a smatch of the knowledge of the mathematics; but when you come to inquire into their knowledge, how short-sighted are the wisest of their students! They know nothing of the motion of the heavenly bodies; and so grossly, absurdly ignorant, that when the sun is eclipsed, they think it is a great dragon has assaulted and run away with it; and they fall a-cluttering with all the drums and kettles in the country, to fright the monster away, just as we do to hive a swarm of bees.|$|E

He was sentenced to five years and fined 3,000-francs, but the Court of Appeals released him. Vidocq is credited with having introduced record-keeping, criminology, and ballistics to criminal investigation. He made the first plaster casts of shoe impressions. He created indelible ink and unalterable bond paper with his printing company. His form of anthropometrics is still partially used by French police. He is also credited for philanthropic pursuits - he claimed he never informed on anyone who had stolen for real need.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION This paper {{grows out}} of a group process of {{studying}} handmade fabric, embroidery, and trim in Fez, Morocco in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. 1 The group included three textile scholars, a video specialist and myself, an anthropologist. 2 While the textile scholars began the project {{with an interest in}} the textile products and their means of production, we all became interested in more social aspects of the work. Other scholars have noted the cues cloth can give in understanding the social relations of a culture. Reddy (1986) looks for hints of the social tensions leading to the French Revolution in the changing ways merchants and others 2 Ì 2 talked 2 Ì 2 about cloth in a <b>universal</b> dictionary of <b>commerce</b> published several times between 1730 and 1784. He finds 2 Ì 2 [...] . an odd combination of rigidity and flexibility [...] . (264) 2 Ì 2 which he relates to the later upheaval of the 1789 Revolution, a throwing aside of the old order and difficulty in accepting a new one. In the dictionary 2 Ì 7 s discussion of commodities, he sees 2 Ì 2 [...] . the necessary intimacy that always subsists between social relationships and things (282). 2 Ì 2 In their Introduction to Cloth and Human Experience (1989), Schneider and Weiner give an overview of the way textiles and their manufacture are important in 2 Ì 2 [...] . the reproduction of social life and power (4). 2 Ì 2 Of special interest here is their discussion of cloth in large scale societies, like Morocco today. While such cultures have wide access to machine made fabric, some local handmade textiles persist 2 Ì 2 [...] . as aspects of the consolidation of cultural identities [...] . (16). 2 Ì 2 One of their examples is Ghandi 2 Ì 7 s adoption of homespun cotton cloth in India as a symbol, and fact, of India 2 Ì 7 s independence from British manufacturing. While the other papers on Morocco focus more on the textile products, though including social context, I will deal specifically with the social lives and interactions of the textile producers, merchants and consumers, and through them and their dealing with changing economic and social conditions, present a picture of one segment of Moroccan society today. THE CONTEXT OF FEZ The name Fez in association with handmade textiles may call up images of the exotic East, frozen in time. While a first visit to the old city or medina can reinforce this image, it is only one part of the total picture. Before we discuss the artisans and merchants and their products and customers in detail, the reader needs an accurate context in which to understand them. The city of Fez is located in Morocco, on the northwest shoulder of Africa. While Morocco is an Arab Muslim country, for centuries it has been a crossroads for the cultures of Europe, sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. In size and climate Morocco resembles California, and grows wheat as a staple crop, a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, and citrus for export. Handmade carpets and factory-produced leather jackets, bags and shoes are also exported. Fez is the traditional cultural capital of Morocco, the source of the quintessential forms of Moroccan music, food, and handicrafts, and longtime provider of the country 2 Ì 7 s intellectual and political leaders. Fez is also Morocco 2 Ì 7 s mercantile capital, where tradition is balanced with innovation, as you will see below. The coexistence of old and new is physically present in the city itself, which has modern Europeanized sections with broad tree-lined avenues strolled by young men in leather jackets and women in western dress. In older sections with narrow winding streets, one can still see traces of areas organized by different craft guilds. The city was founded in 829 A. D., soon after Islam arrived in Morocco, and 2 Ì 2 new Fez 2 Ì 2 dates from the 1300 s...|$|R
