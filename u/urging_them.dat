5|$|Josip Broz Tito and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, then {{located in}} Zagreb, {{along with the}} Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia, sent a {{delegation}} to 4th Army headquarters in Bjelovar <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to issue arms to workers to help defend Zagreb. Pavle Gregorić, {{who was a member}} of both Central Committees, went to the headquarters twice, and was able to speak briefly with Nedeljković, but could not convince him to do so. On the same day, Maček, who had returned to Zagreb after briefly joining the post-Yugoslav coup d'état government of Dušan Simović, agreed to send an emissary to the 108th Infantry Regiment <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to obey their officers, but they did not respond to his appeal.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Central Conference of American Rabbis {{issued a}} {{resolution}} calling {{for the end of}} sports teams names that promote racism, in particular the Atlanta Braves and the Washington Redskins. The Anti-Defamation League was one of the organizations signing a letter to broadcasters <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to avoid using the name. The Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism also advocates a name change.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the mouth}} of the Bad Axe River, on 1 August 1832, Black Hawk and Winnebago prophet and fellow British Band leader White Cloud advised the band against wasting time {{building}} rafts to cross the Mississippi River, because the U.S. forces were closing in, <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> instead to flee northward and seek refuge among the Ho-Chunk. However, most of the band chose to try to cross the river.|$|E
5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better-known candidates.|$|E
5|$|In 613 Laurence consecrated {{the monastery}} church built by Augustine in Canterbury, and {{dedicated}} it to saints Peter and Paul; {{it was later}} re-consecrated as St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury. Laurence also wrote to the bishops in the lands held by the Scots and by the Britons, <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to hold Easter {{on the day that}} the Roman church celebrated it, instead of their traditional date, part of the Easter controversy. The letter is also preserved in Bede's history. Laurence in 609 stated that Dagan, a native bishop, would not eat with Laurence or share a roof with the archbishop, due to {{the differences between the two}} Churches.|$|E

5|$|In October 1942, Popovac {{issued an}} appeal to Muslim Partisans, <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to join the Chetniks and turn against the Ustaše. In a report to Mihailović dated 3 November, Popovac wrote:I have to {{emphasize}} to you the intimate cooperation between the Muslims and Orthodox in the Stolac district from where, through the joint struggle of the Muslims and Orthodox, the Croat inhabitants, who were largely Ustaša-inclined, have been expelled. In that way, from Gabela to Mostar the entire left bank of the Neretva has been cleansed, {{and the number of}} refugees has been estimated at 12,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Jamaican {{officials}} issued {{radio and}} television advisories for residents in low-lying areas, <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to be ready and evacuate if necessary. The Jamaican government opened all shelters {{on the island and}} placed its armed forces on standby. Long lines for storm supplies were reported at local businesses ahead of the storm as residents rushed to obtain supplies in preparation for Ernesto's onslaught. When a tropical storm warning was put in effect for Jamaica and the central Bahamas, cruise ship companies indicated they were diverting several liners to avoid the storm.|$|E
5|$|Outside the pays d'en haut, most warriors of the {{influential}} Iroquois Confederacy {{did not participate}} in Pontiac's War because of their alliance with the British, known as the Covenant Chain. However, the westernmost Iroquois nation, the Seneca tribe, had become disaffected with the alliance. As early as 1761, the Seneca began to send out war messages to the Great Lakes and Ohio Country tribes, <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to unite in an attempt to drive out the British. When the war finally came in 1763, many Seneca were quick to take action.|$|E

5|$|Shakur's {{attorneys}} {{sought a}} new trial {{on the grounds that}} one jury member, John McGovern, had violated the jury's sequestration order. Judge Appleby rejected Kunstler's claim that the juror had violated the order. McGovern later sued Kunstler for defamation; Kunstler eventually publicly apologized to McGovern and paid him a small settlement. Additionally, in his autobiography, Kunstler alleged that he later learned from a law enforcement agent that a New Jersey State Assembly member had addressed the jury at the hotel where they were sequestered, <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to convict Shakur.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} elevation, Basiliscus had {{despatched}} Illus {{and his brother}} Trocundus against Zeno, who, now in his native fortresses, had resumed {{the life of an}} Isaurian chieftain. Basiliscus, however, failed to fulfill the promises he made to the two generals; furthermore, they received letters from some of the leading ministers at the court, <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to secure the return of Zeno, for the city now preferred a restored Isaurian to a Miaphysite whose unpopularity increased with the fiscal rapacity of his ministers.|$|E
5|$|Upon Duke Frederick II of Austria's invitation, Béla went to Hainburg an der Donau. However, {{instead of}} helping Béla, the Duke {{forced him to}} cede three {{counties}} (most probably Locsmánd, Pozsony, and Sopron). From Hainburg, Béla fled to Zagreb and sent letters to Pope Gregory IX, Emperor Frederick II, King Louis IX of France and other Western European monarchs, <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to send reinforcements to Hungary. In the hope of military assistance, he even accepted Emperor Frederick II's suzerainty in June. The Pope declared a Crusade against the Mongols, but no reinforcements arrived.|$|E

5|$|Andronikos Komnenos murdered Emperor Alexios II in late 1183. The {{contemporaneous}} Eustathius of Thessalonica {{writes that}} Andronikos's opponents sent letters to many monarchs, including Béla III, <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to attack Andronikos. According to Ansbert and other Western European chroniclers, Béla invaded the Byzantine Empire in early 1185. After Andronikos I fell in September, Béla signed {{a peace treaty}} with the new emperor, Isaac II Angelos. Isaac married Béla's daughter, Margaret, and Béla granted the region of Niš and Barancs to Isaac as his daughter's dowry. The relics of Saint Ivan of Rila were also returned to Sardica on this occasion. Béla married Margaret of France, a sister of Philip II of France, {{in the summer of}} 1186.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 19July 1941, Stojanović and Bašić arrived at the camp of the communists and their sympathisers who escaped from Prijedor, {{situated}} at Rajlića Kosa above the village of Malo Palančište. The news of Stojanović's escape soon spread throughout the Prijedor district. The group, mostly in the early twenties, enjoyed an increase in their credibility and esteem since a well-known and respected doctor had joined their camp. People from surrounding Serb villages brought food and other supplies to Stojanović and his young comrades. Stojanović gave speeches to the villagers, telling them {{to be prepared for}} an impending uprising and <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to bring him rifles they were hiding in their homes. The camp at Rajlića Kosa was the first Partisan camp in the Kozara area.|$|E
5|$|After a rest {{day on the}} Sunday of the game, England resumed on Monday with England still 223 runs in arrears. The Nottinghamshire {{secretary}} H. A. Brown broadcast {{an appeal}} to the spectators via the public address system, <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to refrain from barracking Miller. In response, they clapped when the Australians took to the field. The chairman of Nottinghamshire reportedly apologised to Bradman in private regarding the crowd reaction to Miller. Taking the new ball in the fifth over of the day, in the overcast conditions that morning, Miller bowled a relatively full length, rather than bouncers, and swung the ball; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps. Shortly after a break for bad light, he bowled Hutton with an off cutter. This brought in Hardstaff, who was dropped from his third delivery by Arthur Morris at slip. In the remainder of the over, Hardstaff played and missed, then edged two further balls; the second edge went for four runs through the slips. During the morning session, Bradman used Miller for 11 overs in a row to pressurise the Englishmen.|$|E

5|$|As a boy, Jinnah {{lived for}} a time in Bombay with an aunt and may have {{attended}} the Gokal Das Tej Primary School there, later on studying at the Cathedral and John Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High School. He gained his matriculation from Bombay University at the high school. In his later years and especially after his death, a large number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were circulated: that he spent all his spare time at the police court, listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his books by the glow of street lights for lack of other illumination. His official biographer, Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed surviving boyhood associates, and obtained a tale that the young Jinnah discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust, <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket instead.|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{also served}} as a charter member of the first American Civil Liberties Union chapter {{organized}} in the South in the 1950s. She lent her support to the Equal Rights Amendment, speaking to the legislature in Tallahassee <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to ratify it. In the 1980s Douglas lent her support to the Florida Rural Legal Services, a group that worked to protect migrant farm workers who were centered on Belle Glade, and who were primarily employed by the sugarcane industry. She wrote to Governor Bob Graham in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions the migrant workers endured. The same year, Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center, which had been housed in hot dog stands, needed a building of its own. The center received a portable building until 1991 when the Florida Department of Education endowed $1.8million for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center in Crandon Park. Douglas co-founded the Friends of the Miami-Dade Public Libraries with her longtime friend Helen Muir, and served as its first president.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, a {{privilege}} escalation exploit {{was discovered in}} the Windows kernel that can allow unsigned code to run under Windows RT; the exploit involved {{the use of a}} remote debugging tool (provided by Microsoft to debug WinRT apps on Windows RT devices) to execute code which changes the signing level stored in RAM to allow unsigned code to execute (by default, it is set to a level that only allows code signed by Microsoft to execute). Alongside his explanation of the exploit, the developer also included a personal appeal to Microsoft <b>urging</b> <b>them</b> to remove the restrictions on Windows RT devices, contending that their decision was not for technical reasons, and that the devices would be more valuable if this functionality were available. In a statement, a Microsoft spokesperson applauded the effort, indicating that the exploit does not pose a security threat because it requires administrative access to the device, advanced techniques, and would still require programs to be re-compiled for ARM. However, Microsoft has still indicated that the exploit would be patched in a future update.|$|E
