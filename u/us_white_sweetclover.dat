40|$|<b>White</b> <b>sweetclover</b> and {{narrowleaf hawksbeard}} are nonindigenous {{invasive}} plant species in Alaska that are rapidly spreading, including into {{areas that are}} otherwise free of nonindigenous plants. There has been concern that native moose could be dispersing germinable seed from these plants after ingestion. To address this concern, a study was conducted involving tame moose at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Agriculture and Forestry Experiment Station, Matanuska Experiment Farm, Palmer, AK. Objectives were to determine if seeds from these two plant species could survive mastication and digestive passage through moose, whether this passage impacted seed germination, and whether seed passage rates {{were the same as}} similar sized Cr-mordanted fiber. In this study, narrowleaf hawksbeard seed rarely survived mastication and digestion with only five seedlings recovered from 42, 000 germinable seed fed to the moose. About 16 % of germinable <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover</b> seed (3, 595 of 22, 000) fed to the moose produced seedlings. Most of the sweetclover seedlings came from feces produced 2 and 3 d after feeding. In two moose, sweetclover seedlings were grown from fecal material that was passed 11 d after feeding, raising the possibility that seeds could be transported long distances after ingestion. Cr-mordanted fiber passage did not closely follow seedling producing seed, possibly because time in the rumen might reduce seed germination. Once roadsides in Alaska become infested with <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover,</b> moose can then serve as a transport vector of these weeds into river channels and floodplains, which are distant from roads. This information will impact <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover</b> management programs and alert land managers to the potential for other instances of wildlife-mediated seed dispersal...|$|R
50|$|Wild lupine is {{the sole}} larval food source of the Karner blue butterfly. Adult Karner blue {{butterflies}} obtain nectar from several native and nonnative species. Karner blue butterflies have been reported feeding on the nectar of 41 different species in a single study in west-central Wisconsin. Broods differ significantly in the species used for nectaring, likely {{due to differences in}} their phenology. Several blackberries have been documented as food sources for the spring brood, while spotted beebalm, <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover</b> (Melilotus alba), and flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), are widely cited sources of nectar in the summer. Common cinquefoil (Potentilla simplex) is used as a nectar species for both broods. Karner blue butterflies' preferred nectar species may include butterfly weed in New York and Michigan and lyrate rockcress (Arabis lyrata), lanceleaf tickseed (Coreopsis lanceolata), <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover,</b> and northern dewberry (Rubus flagellaris) at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Differences in nectar species used between male and female Karner blue butterflies and across locations have been reported. Other often mentioned nectar sources include New Jersey tea (Ceanothus americanus), wild lupine, goldenrods (Solidago spp.), and spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa).|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of nitrogen-fixing nodules of the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, especially {{the early stages}} of root hair deformation and curling, infection thread formation, and nodule initiation, has been well studied from a genetic standpoint. In contrast, the factors important for the colonization of surfaces by rhizobia, including roots-an important prerequisite for nodule formation-have not been as thoroughly investigated. We developed conditions for analyzing the ability of two fast-growing rhizobia, Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae, to produce biofilms on abiotic surfaces such as glass, plastic microtiter plates, sand and soil as a prelude to characterizing the genes important for aggregation and attachment. Factors involved in adherence to abiotic surfaces are likely to be used in rhizobial attachment to legume root cells. In this report, we show that S. meliloti exopolysaccharide-deficient mutants as well as exopolysaccharide overproducers exhibit reduced biofilm phenotypes that show parallels with their nodulation abilities. We also investigated two flagella-less S. meliloti mutants and found them to have reduced biofilming capabilities. To investigate whether there was a symbiotic phenotype, we tested one of the Fla(-) mutants on two different S. meliloti hosts, alfalfa and <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover,</b> and found that nodule formation was significantly delayed on the latter...|$|R
40|$|Background. Current {{mortality}} rates {{are essential for}} monitoring, understanding and developing policy for a population&#x 0027;s health. Disease-specific Alaska Native {{mortality rates}} have been undergoing change. Objective. This article reports recent mortality data (2004 &#x 2013; 2008) for Alaska Native/American Indian (AN/AI) people, comparing mortality rates to <b>US</b> <b>white</b> rates and examines changes in mortality patterns since 1980. Design. We used death record data {{from the state of}} Alaska, Department of Vital Statistics and SEER*Stat software from the National Cancer Institute to calculate age-adjusted mortality rates. Results. Annual age-adjusted mortality from all-causes for AN/AI persons during the period 2004 &#x 2013; 2008 was 33 % higher than the rate for <b>US</b> <b>whites</b> (RR= 1. 33, 95 % CI 1. 29 &#x 2013; 1. 38). Mortality rates were higher among AN/AI males than AN/AI females (1212 / 100, 000 vs. 886 / 100, 000). Cancer remained {{the leading cause of death}} among AN/AI people, as it has in recent previous periods, with an age-adjusted rate of 226 / 100, 000, yielding a rate ratio (RR) of 1. 24 compared to <b>US</b> <b>whites</b> (95 % CI 1. 14 &#x 2013; 1. 33). Statistically significant higher mortality compared to <b>US</b> <b>white</b> mortality rates was observed for nine of the ten leading causes of AN/AI mortality (cancer, unintentional injury, suicide, alcohol abuse, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], cerebrovascular disease, chronic liver disease, pneumonia/influenza, homicide). Mortality rates were significantly lower among AN/AI people compared to <b>US</b> <b>whites</b> for heart disease (RR= 0. 82), the second leading cause of death. Among leading causes of death for AN/AI people, the greatest disparities in mortality rates with <b>US</b> <b>whites</b> were observed in unintentional injuries (RR= 2. 45) and suicide (RR= 3. 53). All-cause AN/AI mortality has declined 16 % since 1980 &#x 2013; 1983, compared to a 21 % decline over a similar period among <b>US</b> <b>whites.</b> Conclusion. Mortality rates and trends are essential to understanding the health of a population and guiding policy decisions. The overall AN/AI mortality rate is higher than that of <b>US</b> <b>whites,</b> although encouraging declines in mortality have occurred for many cause specific deaths, as well as for the overall rate. The second leading cause of AN/AI mortality, heart disease, remains lower than that of <b>US</b> <b>whites...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{collection}} of symbiotic (sym) mutants of <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover</b> (Melilotus alba Desr.) provides a developmental sequence of mutants blocked early in infection or nodule organogenesis. Mutant phenotypes include non-nodulating mutants that exhibit root-hair deformations {{in response to}} Rhizobium meliloti, mutants that form ineffective nodules lacking infection threads, and mutants that form infection threads and ineffective nodules. Mutant alleles from both the sym- 1 and the sym- 3 loci exhibited a non-nodulating phenotype in response to R. meliloti, although one allele in the sym- 1 locus formed ineffective nodules at a low frequency. Spot-inoculation experiments on a non-nodulating allele in the sym- 3 locus indicated that this mutant lacked cortical cell divisions following inoculation with R. meliloti. The auxin transport inhibitor N-(1 -naphthyl) phthalamic acid elicited development of pseudonodules at a high frequency {{on all of the}} sweetclover sym mutants, including the non-nodulating mutants, in which the early nodulin ENOD 2 was expressed. This suggests that N-(1 -naphthyl) phthalamic acid activates cortical cell divisions by circumventing a secondary signal transduction event that is lacking in the non-nodulating sweetclover mutants. The sym- 3 locus and possibly the sym- 1 locus appear to be essential to early host plant responses essential to nodule organogenesis...|$|R

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} considerable {{variability in the}} volumes of different glomeruli in given individuals (individual glomerular volume: IGV) in a stereologic study of kidneys at forensic autopsy performed to investigate sudden or unexpected death in people without manifest kidney disease. We review some important associations of IGV by subject characteristics and by ethnic groups. IGVs were measured by the Cavalieri method in 30 glomeruli in each of 111 adult males who belonged to 4 ethnic groups, i. e. <b>US</b> <b>Whites,</b> African- Americans, Africans from Senegal, and Australian Aborigines. Correlations of pooled IGV values with certain subject characteristics were evaluated in the <b>US</b> <b>Whites.</b> Pooled IGV data were compared in subjects across the 4 ethnic groups. In <b>US</b> <b>Whites,</b> mean IGV and its variance were greater with higher age, lower nephron number, lower birth weight, and with gross obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular death. In comparisons by ethnic group, mean IGV and IGV ranges were higher in African-Americans and Australian Aborigines than in <b>US</b> <b>Whites</b> and African Senegalese subjects. We conclude that glomerular enlargement with volume heterogeneity marks more advanced age, relative nephron deficiency, lower birth weight, obesity, hypertension, and advanced cardiovascular disease.

40|$|BackgroundWe have {{previously}} demonstrated, using a regional California Cancer Registry database, that Asian ethnicity {{is an independent}} favorable prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). MethodsRetrospective population-based analysis of Korean and <b>US</b> <b>white</b> patients with NSCLC with known smoking status from Samsung Cancer Center, Seoul, South Korea, and a Southern California Regional Cancer Registry between 1998 and 2005 with follow-up through February 2008 to allow for even case ascertainment periods before and after 2002, when epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors were introduced in Korea and considered as the year of reference. ResultsA total of 4622 Korean and 8846 <b>US</b> <b>white</b> patients were analyzed. Median age of diagnosis was 63 years versus 71 years for Korean and white patients, respectively (P < 0. 0001). A total of 34. 5 % of Korean compared with 8. 2 % white patients were never-smokers. There was significant OS improvement in never-smokers when compared with ever-smokers among either Korean patients (p < 0. 0141) or <b>US</b> <b>white</b> (p < 0. 0397), respectively. There was significant improvement in OS among Korean patients from 2002 to 2005 compared with 1998 – 2001 (p < 0. 0001) but not among <b>US</b> <b>white</b> patients (p = 0. 5641). Except for stage II patients (p = 0. 0723), univariate analysis revealed Korean patients had improved OS compared with <b>US</b> <b>white</b> patients among stages I, III, and IV, respectively (all p < 0. 0001). Multivariate analysis revealed Korean ethnicity (versus white; hazard ratio (HR) = 0. 869; p < 0. 0001) was an independent favorable factor for OS. The adjusted HR for OS Korean ethnicity when compared with white ethnicity improved during 2002 – 2005 (HR = 0. 795; p < 0. 0001) compared with 1998 – 2001 (HR = 0. 889; p = 0. 0013). ConclusionsThese results suggest that Korean ethnicity compared with <b>US</b> <b>white</b> ethnicity is an independent favorable prognostic factor for OS in NSCLC. In addition, greater survival benefit among Korean patients with NSCLC was noted in the postepidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor era (2002 and after) compared with <b>US</b> <b>white</b> ethnicity...|$|R
40|$|Legume lectins {{have been}} {{proposed}} to have important symbiotic roles during Rhizobium-legume symbioses. To test this hypothesis, the symbiotic responses of transgenic alfalfa plants that express {{a portion of the}} putative alfalfa lectin gene MsLEC 1 or MsLEC 2 in either the antisense or sense orientation were analyzed following inoculation with wild-type Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021. MsLEC 1 -antisense (LEC 1 AS) plants were stunted, exhibited hypernodulation, and developed not only abnormally large nodules but also numerous small nodules, both of which senesced prematurely. MsLEC 2 -antisense plants were intermediate in growth and nodule number compared with LEC 1 AS and vector control plants. The symbiotic abnormalities of MsLEC 1 -sense transgene plants were similar to but milder than the responses shown by the LEC 1 AS plants, whereas MsLEC 2 -sense transgene plants exhibited symbiotic responses that were identical to those of vector and nontransgenic control plants. MsLEC 1 mRNA accumulation was not detected in nodule RNA by Northern blot analysis but was localized to alfalfa nodule meristems and the adjacent cells of the invasion zone by in situ hybridization; transcripts were also detected in root meristems.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The nitrogen-fixing {{symbiosis}} between Rhizobiaceae and legumes {{is one of}} the best-studied interactions established between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The plant develops root nodules in which the bacteria are housed, and atmospheric nitrogen is fixed into ammonia by the rhizobia and made available to the plant in exchange for carbon compounds. It has been hypothesized that this symbiosis evolved from the more ancient arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, in which the fungus associates with roots and aids the plant in the absorption of mineral nutrients, particularly phosphate. Support comes from several fronts: 1) legume mutants where Nod 2 and Myc 2 co-segregate, and 2) the fact that various early nodulin (ENOD) genes are expressed in legume AM. Both strongly argue for the idea that the signal transduction pathways between the two symbioses are conserved. We have analyzed the responses of four classes of non-nodulating Melilotus alba (<b>white</b> <b>sweetclover)</b> mutants to Glomus intraradices (the mycorrhizal symbiont) to investigate how Nod 2 mutations affect the establishment of this symbiosis. We also re-examined the root hair responses of the non-nodulating mutants to Sinorhizobium meliloti (the nitrogen-fixing symbiont). Of the four classes, several sweetclover sym mutants are both Nod 2 and Myc 2. In an attempt to decipher the relationship between nodulation and mycorrhiza formation, we also performed co-inoculation experiments with mutant rhizobia and Glomus intraradices on Medicago sativa, a close relative of M. alba. Even though sulfated Nod factor was supplied by some of the bacterial mutants, the fungus did not complement symbiotically defective rhizobia for nodulation...|$|R
