30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} class of {{algorithms}} {{to solve the problem}} of maximizing utility for job scheduling where each job consists of multiple tasks. Different from the existing works which either consider job <b>utility</b> or <b>task</b> <b>utility</b> individually, this paper considers both job <b>utility</b> and <b>task</b> <b>utility</b> simultaneously by introducing extra utility for every job. We analyze the complexity of the problem and discuss two sub-problems of scheduling jobs in a single machine and scheduling jobs in multiple machines. We design two 2 -approximation algorithms for the sub-problems, and the approximation proofs are also presented. Although the time complexity is pseudo polynomial, we provide a theoretical insight into this problem.|$|R

50|$|In November 2016, the U.S. Marine Corps {{signed a}} $2.5 million {{contract}} with Polaris to deliver 144 MRZR-D ATVs. Called the <b>Utility</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (UTV), it is {{a version of the}} vehicle already in use by U.S. Special Operations Command, but is designed to be diesel-powered and can run on JP-8 fuel. The Marines bought the unarmored ATVs because they can fit inside an MV-22 Osprey, enabling them to be deployed from long distances, to provide logistics support to ground combat units, assisting them to travel and transport supplies quicker and easier than previously on foot. The vehicles can carry four troops and have a small cargo bed capable of carrying 1500 lb of payload. It is planned to field 18 MRZR-Ds per infantry regiment. The vehicles are to be delivered from late-January to April 2017.|$|E

30|$|Similar to the {{analysis}} of task engagement in L 1 and L 2 done by Lee (2011), closed tasks such as text reconstruction engage learners more than the open end tasks do (jigsaw task, dictogloss).

40|$|Abstract—Energy {{harvesting}} sensor nodes {{eliminate the}} need for post-deployment physical human interaction by using en-vironmental power and wireless communication; however, they must adapt the <b>utility</b> of their <b>tasks</b> to accommodate the energy availability. For example, on sunny days, a solar-powered sensor node can perform highly accurate tasks requiring more extensive computation and communication, but on cloudy days, it must reduce utility due to a decrease in harvested energy. In this paper, we present a controller that uses two algorithms to balance <b>task</b> <b>utility</b> and execution time subject to an energy constraint. One algorithm determines the total execution time of a set of tasks such that desired <b>task</b> <b>utilities</b> are met, while the other solves the converse problem by approximating the maximum <b>task</b> <b>utilities</b> achievable within a global deadline. We apply our methods to a prototype Structural Health Monitoring system, demonstrating the controller’s ability to adapt at runtime.

40|$|The Total Cost of Ownership and the {{payback period}} are main {{purchase}} criterions of fleet operators regarding {{the acquisition of}} new commercial vehicles. Therefore, critical success factors are purchase and operating costs. However, purchase and operating costs are highly individual depending on transport <b>task,</b> <b>vehicle</b> size and powertrain technology. In order to perform a comparable and transparent evaluation of competing powertrain technologies a development of a systemic and consistent evaluation model which considers the transport <b>task,</b> specific <b>vehicle</b> configuration and related costs is required. Within this study, a techno-economic evaluation approach {{for the assessment of}} future commercial vehicle concepts coping with the complexity of the road freight transportation sector is introduced which supports strategic decisions of fleet operators and manufacturers relating to investments in alternative commercial vehicle powertrain technologies considering specific requirements as to payload, volumetric load, driving range, vehicle cost and payback period. Furthermore, by the use of the transport application based cost model information to policy makers to what circumstances alternative commercial vehicle powertrain technologies reach competitiveness are generated. For demonstration reason exemplary use case and different powertrain concepts for a tractor-trailer combination with 40 tonnes of gross vehicle weight is analysed...|$|R

40|$|Present quality {{assessment}} (QA) algorithms aim to generate scores for natural images consistent with subjective {{scores for the}} {{quality assessment}} task. For the quality assessment task, human observers evaluate a natural image based on its perceptual resemblance to a reference. Natural images communicate useful information to humans, and this paper investigates the <b>utility</b> assessment <b>task,</b> where human observers evaluate the usefulness of a natural image as a surrogate for a reference. Current QA algorithms implicitly assess utility insofar as an image that exhibits strong perceptual resemblance to a reference is also of high utility. However, a perceived quality score is not a proxy for a perceived utility score: a decrease in perceived quality may not affect the perceived utility. Two experiments are conducted to investigate {{the relationship between the}} quality assessment and <b>utility</b> assessment <b>tasks.</b> The results from these experiments provide evidence that any algorithm optimized to predict perceived quality scores cannot immediately predict perceived utility scores. Several QA algorithms are evaluated in terms of their ability to predict subjective scores for the quality and <b>utility</b> assessment <b>tasks.</b> Among the QA algorithms evaluated, the visual information fidelity (VIF) criterion, which is frequently reported to provide the highest correlation with perceived quality, predicted both perceived quality and utility scores reasonably. The consistent performance of VIF for both the tasks raised suspicions in light of the evidence from the psychophysica...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to students’ expectancies for success [8], motivation {{can also be}} affected by a student’s value for the domain or task. Task value {{is central to the}} expectancy-value motivational theory [17, 19]. Task value is generally discussed in terms of utility value, intrinsic value, attainment value, and cost [55, 56]). Utility value refers to the student’s perception of how useful a given task or domain is in his or her life. Intrinsic value references the student’s enjoyment of the task or domain. Attainment describes the perceived importance of succeeding at a task, while cost refers to the effort needed to complete a task. Task value can be predictive of students’ motivation for the given task or, in relation to the current study, science. Studies indicate that intrinsic and <b>utility</b> <b>task</b> value are predictive of students’ effort in academic settings [6, 19, 56].|$|R
40|$|Information-movement {{coupling}} is {{a fundamental}} concept, integral to theorizing on the coordination of goal-directed activity in ecological psychology.

Recent research highlighting the relevance of information-movement coupling for the process of practice in sport is discussed. We conclude that information-movement coupling represents an important principle for the structural organization of research and practice in self-paced extrinsic timing tasks and that further work is required to verify its significance across a range of sport movement...|$|R

5000|$|After the United States' {{entry into}} World War II, {{complaints}} arose from Army soldiers and Marines issued World War I-era bronze or alloy-handled trench knives {{such as the}} U.S. Mark I trench knife for use in hand-to-hand fighting. The Mark I was relatively expensive and time-consuming to manufacture, and reports from the field indicated that the knife's large 'brass-knuckle' fingerguard handle {{made it difficult to}} secure in conventional scabbards while limiting the range of useful fighting grip positions. [...] Another criticism was that the Mark I's relatively thin blade was prone to breakage when used for common <b>utility</b> <b>tasks</b> such as cutting wire or opening ammunition crates and ration cans. [...] A final impetus came from the War Department, which had determined the need for a new multipurpose knife capable of fulfilling the roles of both a fighting and a utility knife, {{while at the same time}} conserving strategic metal resources.|$|R

The operator decides for a running window about having a road junction or not. The found junctions are marked in the output image. The operator was improved by additional features considering parallelism information of roads in junctions.
