5|$|Kirchner {{was tried}} for <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> in 2004, {{with the case}} {{focusing}} on the increase in his wealth from 1995 to 2003. The case was first heard by judge Juan José Galeano and moved to judge Julián Ercolini, who acquitted him in 2005. A new case involving both Kirchners was heard by judge Norberto Oyarbide, who acquitted them in 2010.|$|E
5|$|However, {{controversy}} arose during rolling-stock selection. In May 1999, as THSRC faced {{difficulties in}} raising capital, {{the government of}} Japan promised soft loans if THSRC switched to TSC. Although Eurotrain promised to match TSC's financial offerings, the Eschede train disaster in combination with TSC offered the newer 700 Series Shinkansen, convinced THSRC to reopen core system bid, and ultimately resulting in TSC selected as the preferred rolling-stock supplier in December 1999. Although Eurotrain eventually conceded in the bid, in February 2001 it filed for a US$800 million damage claim against THSRC at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. After a lengthy arbitration process, the court ruled in March 2004 that THSRC should pay a compensation for the US$32.4 million Eurotrain spent on development and US$35.7 million for <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b> THSRC agreed to pay US$65 million (US$89 million with interest) to Eurotrain in November 2004.|$|E
25|$|Quasi-contractual {{actions were}} {{generally}} (but not exclusively) used to remedy what {{would now be}} called <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b> In most common law jurisdictions the law of quasi-contract has been superseded by the law of <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Conversion, as {{a purely}} civil wrong, is {{distinguishable}} from both theft and <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b> Theft is obviously an act inconsistent with another's rights, and theft {{will also be}} conversion. But not all conversions are thefts because conversion requires no element of dishonesty. Conversion is also different from <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b> If one claims an <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment,</b> {{the person who has}} another's property may always raise a change of position defense, to say they have unwittingly used up the assets they were transferred. For conversion, there always must be an element of voluntarily dealing with another's property, inconsistently with their rights.|$|E
25|$|Falcke v Scottish Imperial Insurance Co - an English <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> law case, also {{concerning}} English contract law, {{and setting}} out some fundamental principles of construction of obligations, as viewed to exist {{by the late}} 19th-century English judiciary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> {{is seen to}} {{underlie}} a final group of constructive trust cases, although this remains controversial. In Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd Goulding J held that a bank that mistakenly paid money to another bank had a claim to the money back under a constructive trust. Mistake would typically {{be seen as an}} <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> claim today, and there is no debate over whether the money could be claimed back in principle. It was, however, questioned whether the claim for the money back should be proprietary in nature, and so whether a constructive trust should arise, particularly if this would bind third parties (for instance, if the recipient bank had gone insolvent). In Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that a constructive trust could only arise if the recipient's conscience would have been affected {{at the time of the}} receipt or before any third party's rights had intervened. In this way, it is controversial whether <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> underlies any constructive trusts at all, although it remains unclear why someone's conscience being affected should make any difference.|$|E
25|$|When a court {{desires to}} hold the {{offending}} party to a transaction responsible so as to prevent <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment,</b> the judge can declare that a fiduciary relation exists between the parties, as though the offender were in fact a trustee for the partner.|$|E
25|$|Securities {{fraud is}} {{becoming}} more complex as the industry develops more complicated investment vehicles. In addition, white collar criminals are expanding the scope of their fraud and are looking outside the United States for new markets, new investors, and banking secrecy havens to hide <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Equity {{remains a}} {{cornerstone}} of Australian private law. A string of cases in the 1980s saw the High Court of Australia re-affirm the continuing vitality of traditional equitable doctrines. The High Court has recently affirmed the importance of Equity and dismissed the suggestion that <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> has explanatory power in relation to traditional equitable doctrines such as subrogation.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, persons under 18 are {{typically}} minor and their contracts are considered voidable; however, if the minor voids the contract, benefits {{received by the}} minor must be returned. The minor can enforce breaches of contract by an adult while the adult's enforcement may be more limited under the bargain principle. Promissory estoppel or <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> may be available, but generally are not.|$|E
25|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{accepted}} {{that there is a}} third category, restitutionary obligations, based on the <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> of the defendant at the plaintiff's expense. Contractual liability, reflecting the constitutive function of contract, is generally for failing to make things better (by not rendering the expected performance), liability in tort is generally for action (as opposed to omission) making things worse, and liability in restitution is for unjustly taking or retaining the benefit of the plaintiff's money or work.|$|E
25|$|Circuit City's City Advantage Plan {{was also}} {{challenged}} in a United States District Court in Massachusetts. The plaintiffs' claim concerned Circuit City's cancellation of its warranty plan without full {{disclosure of the}} plan {{at the time of}} sale. The plaintiffs cited breach of contract, <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment,</b> and violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act. Circuit City requested the matter be dismissed. The court, however, upheld the plaintiffs' claim that the monies paid for the protection plan be reimbursed and credit be issued for non-working goods returned.|$|E
25|$|There were 25 public {{cases in}} 2012 in which former and current {{government}} officials {{were accused of}} illicit enrichment. In September 2013, Ricardo Jaime, who had been Kirchner's Transportation Secretary, was given a six-month suspended sentence on charges of withholding evidence {{in a case of}} <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b> Ombudsman Eduardo Mondino told U.S. Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne in 2011 about allegations that the Argentine government charged a 15% commission on all private international contracts, and wanted Wayne to help find out whether the earnings were being deposited in a U.S. bank. A German CEO also told Planning Minister Julio De Vido that one of the latter's aides had asked him for a bribe.|$|E
25|$|In July 2011, Texas EquuSearch (TES), a {{non-profit}} group which {{assisted in the}} search for Caylee from July to December 2008 when she was believed to be missing, sued Anthony for fraud and <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b> TES estimates that it spent more than $100,000 searching for Caylee even though she was already dead. TES founder and director Tim Miller estimates that the abortive search for Caylee expended 40% of the group's yearly resources which could have been spent looking for other missing children. It only learned that Anthony knew all along that Caylee was dead when the trial began. TES and Anthony eventually settled out of court on October 18, 2013. TES was listed as a creditor to Anthony and was entitled to $75,000.|$|E
25|$|English {{contract}} {{law is a}} body of law regulating contracts in England and Wales. With {{its roots in the}} lex mercatoria and the activism of the judiciary during the industrial revolution, it shares a heritage with countries across the Commonwealth (such as Australia, Canada, India), {{and to a lesser extent}} the United States. It is also experiencing gradual change because of the UK's membership of the European Union and international organisations like Unidroit. Any agreement that is enforceable in court is a contract. Because a contract is a voluntary obligation, in contrast to paying compensation for a tort and restitution to reverse <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment,</b> English law places a high value on ensuring people have truly consented to the deals that bind them in court.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue as}} regards mutual wills is the {{question}} of revocability. In Re Hobley Charles Aldous QC held that there could be either unilateral or mutual revocation provided it occurred during the lifetime of both testators. However, the problem with this approach is that unilateral revocation is against the general principle of contract. Several explanations for this could be proffered. Firstly, there could be an implicit term that the agreement is revocable. Secondly, it could be conceptually viewed that the agreement takes on the revocable nature of the will to which it relates. Thirdly, as the doctrine is based on detrimental reliance, the agreement only concretized on the death of the other party. Fourthly, one could apply the unconscionability rationale that <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> could only be complete when one party takes a benefit under the will of the other party.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, a local {{government}} may only {{enter into a}} contract that is within the scope of its charter. A contract to do something beyond its power is void and unenforceable, and in fact the {{local government}} will be prohibited from performing its obligations under such a contract. The private party who performs under such a contract will have no means of recovery, even under equitable theories such as equitable estoppel, implied contract, quantum meruit, and <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b> This limitation also applies where the subject of the contract is permissible under the charter, but {{the manner in which the}} contract is made or awarded violates proscriptions set forth in the charter. For example, if the charter requires that contracts for provision of a public service be awarded to the lowest bidder in an open bidding process, and such a process is not used to award the contract, then the contract itself is void and the private party to the contract will have no recourse to enforce the local government's obligations thereunder.|$|E
25|$|Companies {{occupy a}} special place in private law, because they have a legal {{personality}} separate from those who invest their capital and labour to run the business. The general rules of contract, tort and <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> operate in the first place against the company as a distinct entity. This differs fundamentally from other forms of business association. A sole trader acquires rights and duties as normal under the general law of obligations. If people carry on business together with a view to profit, they are deemed to have formed a partnership under the Partnership Act 1890 section 1. Like a sole trader, partners will be liable on any contract or tort obligation jointly and severally in shares equal to their monetary contribution, or according to their culpability. Law, accountancy and actuarial firms are commonly organised as partnerships. Since the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000, partners can limit the amount they are liable for to their monetary investment in the business, if the partnership owes more money than the enterprise has. Outside these professions, however, the most common method for businesses to limit their liability is by forming a company.|$|E
25|$|If {{a company}} {{has gone into}} an {{insolvency}} procedure, administrators or liquidators should aim to realise the greatest amount in assets to distribute to creditors. The effect is to alter orthodox private law rules regarding consideration, creation of security and limited liability. The freedom to contract for any consideration, adequate or not, is curtailed when transactions are made for an undervalue, or whenever it comes after the presentation of a winding up petition. The freedom to contract for any security interest is also restricted, as a company's attempt to give an undue preference to one creditor over another, particularly a floating charge for no new money, or any charge that is not registered, can be unwound. Since the Cork Report's emphasis on increasing director accountability, practitioners may sue directors by summary procedure for breach of duties, especially negligence or conflicts of interest. Moreover, and encroaching on limited liability and separate personality, a specific, insolvency related claim was created in 1986 named wrongful trading, so if a director failed to put a company into an insolvency procedure, and ran up extra debts, when a reasonable director would have, he can be made liable {{to contribute to the}} company's assets. Intentional wrongdoing and fraud is dealt with strictly, but proof of a mens rea is unnecessary in the interest of preventing <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> of some creditors at others' expense, and to deter wrongdoing.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the rediscovery of the Roman law in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already {{developed}} far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent. However, the first common law scholars, most notably Glanvill and Bracton, as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law. One of the first and throughout its history {{one of the most significant}} treatises of the common law, Bracton's De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian's Institutes. The impact of Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into in rem (typically, actions against a thing or property for the purpose of gaining title to that property; must be filed in a court where the property is located) and in personam (typically, actions directed against a person; these can affect a person's rights and, since a person often owns things, his property too) used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century. As a result, today, the main systematic divisions of the law into property, contract, and tort (and to some extent <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment)</b> can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.|$|E
25|$|Partly {{because it}} {{may not always be}} the case that a {{wrongdoing}} trustee can be found, or remains solvent, tracing became an important step in restitutionary claims for breach of trust. Tracing means tracking the value of an asset that properly belongs to a trust fund, such as a car, shares, money, or profits made by a trustee through a conflict of interest. If those things are exchanged for other things (i.e. money or assets) then the value residing in the new thing can potentially be claimed by the beneficiaries. For example, in an early case, Taylor v Plumer a dishonest broker, Mr Walsh, was given £22,200 in a banker's draft and was meant to invest in Exchequer Bills (UK government bonds) for Sir Plumer. Instead he bought gold doubloons and was planning a get-away to the Caribbean until he was apprehended at Falmouth. Lord Ellenborough held that the property belonged to Sir Plumer, in whatever form it had become. It may also be that the value of the traced trust money has changed, and possibly risen considerably. In the leading case, Foskett v McKeown an investment manager wrongfully took £20,440 from his clients, paid the last two out of five installments on a life insurance policy, and committed suicide. The insurance company paid out £1,000,000, although under the policy's terms this would have been paid out anyway. The majority of the House of Lords held that clients could trace their money into the payout and claim a proportionate share (£400,000). Theoretically the case was controversial, as the House of Lords rejected that such a tracing claim was founded upon <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment,</b> as opposed to being the vindication of a property right.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{involved}} in further controversy when photographer David LaChapelle sued Rihanna, Island Def Jam and related parties for copyright infringement. LaChapelle alleged that the video infringed upon eight of his photographs published between 1997 and 2010 in GQ, i-D, Vogue Italia and elsewhere. The lawsuit, which claimed unspecified damages, alleged that the video was [...] "directly derived" [...] from LaChapelle's pictures, copying their [...] "composition, total concept, feel, tone, mood, theme, colors, props, settings, decors, wardrobe and lighting". The lawsuit included claims of trade dress infringement under the Lanham Act, unfair competition under New York state law and <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment,</b> {{all of which were}} later dismissed. Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of New York's Southern District Court denied a motion to dismiss the copyright violation allegations, noting similarities between the works: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{right to}} trace {{may be lost}} if the {{property}} cannot be found, or no longer exists. Defences to tracing are possible. The [...] "change of position" [...] defence is where the defendant has received property and giving it back would change his personal circumstances. This was concisely defined by Lord Goff in Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale as [...] "Where an innocent defendant's position is so changed that he will suffer an injustice if called upon to repay or to repay in full, the injustice of requiring him so to repay outweighs the injustice of denying the plaintiff restitution". Such a defence is closely linked with <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment,</b> and has limitations. Any bad faith {{on the part of}} the defendant will invalidate the defence, such as if the recipient of the property has encouraged the payer to transfer it or has received it by mistake and then used it without making enquiries. The defence is also not available to people who act illegally, as in Barros Mattos v MacDaniels Ltd. Activity which constitutes a [...] "change of position" [...] can be broadly defined as taking steps which would not otherwise have been taken, or not taking steps which otherwise would have been taken, as a result of receiving the property.|$|E
2500|$|The {{latter part}} of the 20th century saw {{increased}} debate over the utility of treating equity as a separate body of law. These debates were labelled the [...] "fusion wars". A particular flashpoint in this debate centred around the concept of <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> and whether areas of law traditionally regarded as equitable could be rationalised as part of a single body of law known as the law of <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> When {{someone has}} been {{unjustly}} enriched (or {{there is an}} [...] "absence of basis" [...] for a transaction) at another's expense, this event generates the right to restitution to reverse that gain.|$|E
2500|$|On August 7, 2014, U.S. District Judge Richard H. Kyle (no {{relation}} to Chris Kyle) upheld the jury's award of $500,000 in defamation damages and adopted the jury's advisory award of $1,345,477.25 in <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> as, [...] "reasonable {{and supported by}} a preponderance of the evidence." [...] Attorneys for Kyle's estate said that the defamation damages would be covered by HarperCollins' libel insurance. The <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> award was not covered by insurance and must be paid from Kyle's estate assets. Following the verdict, HarperCollins {{announced that it would}} pull the sub-chapter [...] "Punching out Scruff Face" [...] from all future editions of the book.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{aspect of}} the debate among those who favour {{substantive}} fusion is (beyond whether rights in trusts are personal or proprietary) which underlying [...] "event" [...] to which different trusts [...] "respond". Adding to the scheme of Gaius, that saw obligations as coming from contracts and wrongs, <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> lawyers emphasised that their field was a neglected tertium quid. According to the most influential scheme advocated by Peter Birks, obligations divide into consents, wrongs, unjust enrichments, and [...] "miscellaneous" [...] other events. On this view, express trusts (like contracts, gifts, or estoppels) were consent based, some constructive trusts were too, while other constructive trusts produced rights (proprietary, or with priority in insolvency) for wrongs, and other constructive trusts and all resulting trusts were founded in <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Contract law {{is based}} on the {{principle}} expressed in the Latin phrase pacta sunt servanda, ( [...] "agreements must be kept"). The common law of contract originated with the now-defuct writ of assumpsit, which was originally a tort action based on reliance. Contract law falls within the general law of obligations, along with tort, <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment,</b> and restitution.|$|E
2500|$|On November 29, 2007, Gotham Books, {{the adult}} {{division}} of Penguin USA, released a book entitled The Truth About Chuck Norris: 400 {{facts about the}} World's Greatest Human based on the Chuck Norris Facts. Norris filed suit in December against Penguin USA and author Ian Spector, claiming, [...] "trademark infringement, <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> and privacy rights." [...] Norris dropped the suit in May of the following year.|$|E
2500|$|... 2008 was {{a tumultuous}} year, legally, for Gen Con LLC. [...] On January 10, Lucasfilm {{filed a lawsuit}} against them, {{claiming}} breach of contract, conversion, and <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> over Celebration IV, held in 2006. The suit also claims Gen Con failed to give the money raised at a charity auction held at the event to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Gen Con filed a counter-suit claiming Lucasfilm had no basis for their claims and owed money to Gen Con.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his first}} public speech as president-elect, Kaczyński said that his {{presidency}} would pursue the task of ameliorating the Republic, a process which he said would consist of [...] "purging various pathologies from our life, most prominently crime (...), particularly criminal corruption – that entire, great rush to obtain <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment,</b> a rush that is poisoning society, [...] elementary social security, health security, basic conditions {{for the development of}} the family [...] the security of commerce and the basic conditions for economic development.|$|E
2500|$|The {{jury trial}} started on July 8, 2014. [...] Testimony and {{arguments}} were heard until July 22, 2014. On July 29, 2014, after a three-week trial in Federal Court in Saint Paul, Minnesota, including {{six days of}} jury deliberations, and upon the agreement of both plaintiff and defendant to accept a divided jury verdict, the jury arrived at an 8 to 2 divided verdict {{in favor of the}} plaintiff, and awarded Ventura $1.8 million: $500,000 for defamation and $1,345,477.25 for <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Israel had not {{ratified}} the WIPO Copyright Treaty. Israeli {{law does not}} currently expressly prohibit the circumvention of technological measures used to implement digital rights management. In June 2012 The Israeli Ministry of Justice proposed a bill to prohibit such activities, but the Knesset did not pass it. In September 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the current copyright law could not be interpreted to prohibit the circumvention of digital rights management, though the Court left {{open the possibility that}} such activities could result in liability under the law of <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Equity {{remains a}} {{distinct}} {{part of the}} law of England and Wales. The main challenge to it has come from academic writers working within the law of <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b> Scholars such as Professor Birks and Professor Burrows argue that in many cases the inclusion of the label [...] "legal" [...] or [...] "equitable" [...] before a substantive rule is often unnecessary. Many English universities, such as Oxford and Cambridge, continue to teach Equity as a standalone subject. Leading practitioner texts include Snell's Equity, Lewin on Trusts, and Hayton & Underhill's Law of Trusts and Trustees.|$|E
2500|$|Under common law, {{particularly}} English Law (English <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment),</b> {{a gambling}} contract may {{not give a}} casino bona fide purchaser status, permitting the recovery of stolen funds in some situations. In Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd, where a solicitor used stolen funds to gamble at a casino, the House of Lords overruled the High Court's previous verdict, adjudicating that the casino return the stolen funds less those subject to any change of position defence. U.S. Law precedents are somewhat similar. For case law on recovery of gambling losses where the loser had stolen the funds see [...] "Rights of owner of stolen money as against one who won it in gambling transaction from thief".|$|E
2500|$|Considerable {{disagreement}} exists {{about why}} resulting trusts arise, {{and also the}} circumstances in which they ought to, since it carries property rights rather than simply a personal remedy. The most prominent academic view is that resulting trust respond to <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment.</b> However, this analysis was rejected in the controversial speech of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC. This case involved a claim by the Westdeutsche bank for its money back from Islington council with compound interest. The bank gave the council money under an interest rate swap agreement, but these agreements were found to be unlawful and ultra vires for councils to enter into by the House of Lords in 1992 in Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC partly because the transactions were speculative, and partly because councils were effectively exceeding their borrowing powers under the Local Government Act 1972. There was no question about whether the bank could recover the principal sum of its money, now that these agreements were void, but at the time the courts did not have jurisdiction to award compound interest (rather than simple interest) unless a claimant showed they were making a claim for property that they owned. So, to get more interest back, the bank contended that when money was transferred under the ultra vires agreement, a resulting trust arose immediately in its favour, giving it a property right, and therefore a right to compound interest. The minority of the House of Lords, Lord Goff and Lord Woolf, held that the bank should have no proprietary claim, but they should nevertheless be awarded compound interest. This view was actually endorsed 12 years later by the House of Lords in Sempra Metals Ltd v IRC so that the courts can award compound interest on debts that are purely personal claims. However, the majority in Westdeutsche held that the bank was not entitled to compound interest at all, particularly because there was no resulting trust. Lord Browne-Wilkinson's reasoning was that only if a recipient's conscience were affected, could a resulting trust arise. It followed that because the council could not have known that its transactions were ultra vires until the 1992 decision in Hazell, its [...] "conscience" [...] could not be affected. Theoretically this was controversial because it was unnecessary to reject that resulting trusts respond to <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> in order to deny that a proprietary remedy should be given. Not all <b>unjust</b> <b>enrichment</b> claims necessarily require proprietary remedies, while it does appear that explaining resulting trusts as a response to whatever good [...] "conscience" [...] requires is not especially enlightening.|$|E
