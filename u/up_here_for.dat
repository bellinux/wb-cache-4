6000|$|... "This {{looks like}} the end of our mine," [...] said Kelley, gloomily. [...] "I begin to think that the old witch led us <b>up</b> <b>here</b> just <b>for</b> the sake of visiting that grave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're <b>up</b> <b>here</b> just <b>for</b> {{the fun of}} it, {{so there}} is no {{necessity}} of being too strenuous," [...] said Gif. [...] "We {{want to go back to}} Colby Hall feeling really refreshed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Guess you're green--one o' them city fellers, ain't ye, Mister? Them ere's sheep tracks--my sheep. Wandered off int' th' woods a spell ago, and I hain't {{seen the}} tarnal critters since. Came <b>up</b> <b>here</b> lookin' <b>for</b> um this mornin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What did {{you come}} <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>for,</b> in the daytime, when anybody might have seen you? I thought it wasn't safe to be hangin' 'round here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss March, I do {{not wish}} you to suppose that I brought you <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> the purpose of viewing those rolling hills and distant forests." ...|$|E
6000|$|YANK--I don't {{wait for}} noone. I keep on de move. Say, what yuh drag me <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>for,</b> anyway? Tryin' to kid me, yuh simp, yuh? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Once, Majesty, when I {{first came}} out West, I was down and out--determined to end it all," [...] said Alfred. [...] "And {{happened}} to climb <b>up</b> <b>here</b> looking <b>for</b> a lonely place to die. When I saw that I changed my mind." ...|$|R
50|$|Michael Rawley, a film {{actor who}} starred in Strength and Honour and War of the Buttons grew <b>up</b> <b>here</b> before leaving <b>for</b> acting.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm closing <b>up</b> <b>here</b> soon <b>for</b> a spell," [...] said Presbrey, and now {{his face}} lost its set {{hardness}} and seemed singularly changed. It was a difference, of light and softness. [...] "Won't be so lonesome over at Willow Springs.... I'm being married soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a blessed}} mystery to me," [...] cried Pycroft, {{scratching}} his head. [...] "Whatever {{they wanted to}} bring {{me all the way}} <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>for,</b> and then--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I believe Link Merwell is at {{the bottom}} of this. No {{ordinary}} burglar would bother his head about that kitchen stuff. Merwell did it, just to cause us trouble. Maybe he thought we'd have to give <b>up</b> camping <b>here</b> <b>for</b> the time being." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{it is in}} effect," [...] I replied, [...] "but {{there are}} some seasons when it is very {{unpleasant}} to remain {{in one of those}} towns which are found on the larger islands, and so the owner of this house may come <b>up</b> <b>here</b> sometimes <b>for</b> fresh sea air." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a fine {{thing for}} you to say," [...] {{retorted}} Aunt Jane. [...] "Like as not she'll be fetching that hang-dog Joel Creech <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> you to support." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Tis {{not easy}} to forget good sport, Mr Bingley. With your permission, I will put my horse <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> half an hour. I have a fancy to stroll to the ruins." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prince," [...] I {{whispered to}} Joshua, [...] "you must get {{down off the}} ladder or you will betray us all. Nay, {{it is too late}} to come <b>up</b> <b>here</b> again, <b>for</b> already the {{moonlight}} strikes just above your head. Go down, or we will cast the ladder loose and let you fall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What for?" [...] I cried {{with some}} warmth. [...] "If I were a steady trader {{to the port}} I could {{understand}} it. But a complete stranger! [...] . I may not turn <b>up</b> again <b>here</b> <b>for</b> years. I don't see why! [...] . Do {{you mean to say}} it is customary?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My camp is just back," [...] said Dale, {{as if he}} {{had read}} Helen's mind. [...] "To-morrow we'll fix <b>up</b> comfortable-like round <b>here</b> <b>for</b> you girls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come {{aboard and}} make {{yourself}} at home, Aunty,' he said, with a playful salute. 'I'm just leaving a P.P.C. {{in the old}} place, so when you fly <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> refuge you'll remember me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't really agree, and I'm not tired yet. There's {{no need of}} your coming <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>for</b> {{now that}} it is daylight, Ellen can be trusted to keep a lookout over the island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, we must pull up," [...] said Stalky, {{rising from}} the bed on which he had thrown himself. [...] "We're injured innocence--as usual. We don't know what we've been sent <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>for,</b> do we?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know. Maybe you would," [...] {{the doctor}} said, with a {{roughness}} of tone intended {{to hide the}} sinking of his heart and the faltering of his voice. [...] "All I know is, that you had better get away from here. Some of Sotillo's men may turn <b>up</b> <b>here</b> looking <b>for</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{so would}} I, Patsy Cooper. It {{seems to me}} that if we can save these poor persecuted strangers, it is our bounden duty to stand <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and talk <b>for</b> them till--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no choice; {{but even}} if I had, I should ride out of here in my best court suit, and change it for English clothes when we got down the Ghauts. I may have to come <b>up</b> <b>here</b> again, <b>for</b> aught I know; and it is better, therefore, {{that no one should}} know that I am English." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Weel, I did {{not pass}} quite close to them, as I ran <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> my horse on hearin' the news," [...] replied Duncan; [...] "but I am pretty sure that I saw her sittin' beside Louise." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's queer {{that the}} Pooles don't send some one <b>up</b> <b>here</b> to look <b>for</b> him," [...] remarked Jessie. [...] "If he were my uncle I {{certainly}} wouldn't {{want him to}} be roaming around in the woods that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You won't believe me? Well! You can ask {{anybody that}} comes here if that--that Swede hadn't {{got as far}} as this house on his way home. Why should he turn <b>up</b> <b>here</b> if not <b>for</b> that? You ask anybody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} think I'm a pretty forward young person to come <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and beg <b>for</b> work. I don't {{care if you}} do," [...] she went on, {{swinging}} her foot back and forth. [...] "One has to live." ...|$|R
