40|$|Following the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorney</b> purge of 2006 - 2007, {{it is time}} to {{reassess}} the approach used to appoint interim <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys.</b> Recent events have taught us how quickly <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys</b> can become political pawns. Indeed, this scandal has jeopardized the credibility of federal prosecutors, disillusioned career prosecutors in those positions, and called into question the separation between professionalism and politics in the enforcement of our federal laws. To restore confidence in <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys</b> Offices, a reexamination of the interim appointment process is critical so that the mistakes of 2006 are not repeated...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the proper role}} of politics in federal prosecutions, and how that bears on the position of the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorney.</b> First, the article sets forth an account of the problems disclosed by investigations into the Bush Justice Department, including the controversial firing of nine <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys</b> and claims that particular prosecutions were politically motivated. It then explores the historical development {{of the role of the}} <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys,</b> their relationship to the Attorney General and the Department of Justice, and their role in the contemporary federal criminal justice system. With that background, the article {{considers the}} question whether there should be a fundamental change in the role and character of the position of <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorney.</b> It concludes that a career or civil service role for <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys</b> is neither politically feasible nor desirable. Rather, the presidential appointment of <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys,</b> with approval by the Senate, provides a desirable counterweight to Main Justice, both by creating separate spheres of political influence and by allowing for decentralization of federal power. It argues that there is real value in a structure that delegates federal prosecutorial power to local districts, reinforcing federalism and allowing federal law to be adapted to different conditions. Although the advantages of political appointments for the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys</b> outweigh the disadvantages, there are still reasons for concern. The article evaluates four mechanisms that have been proposed to moderate the effect of partisan politics at the appointment stage and the effect of improper partisan pressure that may be exerted on <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys</b> by the executive branch, Congress or local political leaders. Three of the mechanisms are identified as promising alternatives to an impracticable and undesirable reconfiguration of the Department...|$|R

Yates was nominated to replace Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole, who is leaving that post in January. The <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Senate must confirm the nomination. Yates has served in her current role since 2010. If confirmed, Yates would hold the No. 2 position in the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Department of Justice.

The <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Senate will consider both Yates’ and Lynch’s nominations in January.

She also served as the lead prosecutor in the prosecution of Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph. Prior to joining the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorney’s</b> Office, she practiced law at the Atlanta office of King 2 ̆ 6 Spalding, where she specialized in commercial litigation.

40|$|The forced mid-term resignations of nine <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys</b> was an {{unprecedented}} event in American history. Nearly {{one year after}} the administration executed the removals, the House Judiciary Committee was still reviewing and publicizing emails, memoranda, and other documents in an effort to understand how the firings were effectuated. This Note examines many of those documents and concludes that the removals were likely carried out for partisan reasons. It then draws on the Constitution, Supreme Court precedent, and separation of powers principles to argue that Congress is constitutionally empowered to enact removal limitations for inferior officers such as <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys</b> so long as those limitations do not impermissibly infringe on the president 2 ̆ 7 s Article H authority or result in congressional aggrandizement. Because of the partisan nature of the attorneys 2 ̆ 7 removals, this Note argues that Congress should consider such legislation to limit the president 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> removal of <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys.</b> In considering the constitutionality and efficacy of a potential statute, this Note examines three previous pieces of legislation on which such removal limitations could be modeled before proposing a fourth, hybrid statute that would emphasize the separation of powers values of balance and accountability in barring 2 ̆ 2 partisan 2 ̆ 2 removals of <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys.</b> The Note concludes by claiming that the framework that the Supreme Court created in McDonnell Douglas v.
