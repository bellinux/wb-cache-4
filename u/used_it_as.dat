5|$|In general, Geographia Neoteriki, {{was welcomed}} with enthusiasm by western {{intellectual}} circles. Jean-Baptiste d'Ansse de Villoison, professor of modern Greek in the Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes, <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a textbook for his students. French geographer Barbie du Bocage published a review after the book's publication along with a translated passage. Moreover, travellers who published accounts during the early 19th century, frequently cited the text. François Pouqueville, William Martin Leake, Henry Holland, and Lord Byron mentioned this work, and <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a source of information. The book also enjoyed some popularity in the non Greek regions of the Balkan peninsula, while 19th century Bulgarian authors of geographic textbooks <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a model.|$|E
5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) {{defended the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship against Team Canada (Eric Young and Petey Williams), who were {{accompanied}} by A-1, in a Six Sides of Steel Strap match next.

AMW retained the titles after forcing Williams into the mat by performing their signature maneuver, the Death Sentence.|$|E
5|$|Centre Point, {{just beyond}} {{the eastern end of}} Oxford Street next to Tottenham Court Road station, was {{designed}} by property developer Harry Hyams and opened in 1966. It failed to find a suitable tenant and sat empty for many years, eventually being occupied by squatters who <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a centre of protest against the lack of suitable accommodation in Central London. In 2015, the building began to be converted into residential flats, with development expected to finish in 2017.|$|E

5|$|Early {{ideas for}} The Downward Spiral were {{conceived}} after the Lollapalooza 1991 festival concerts ended in September of that year. Reznor developed a concept about the album's themes and later <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> lyrics. He searched for {{and moved to}} 10050 Cielo Drive, renting it for $11,000 per month from July 4, 1992, marking {{the beginning of the}} making of both Broken and The Downward Spiral. This was against his initial choice to record the album in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|Goodwin's sixth book, Team of Rivals {{was well}} {{received}} by critics {{and won the}} 2006 Lincoln Prize and the inaugural Book Prize for American History of the New-York Historical Society. US President Barack Obama cited {{it as one of}} his favorite books and was said to have <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a model for constructing his own cabinet. In 2012, a Steven Spielberg film based on the book was released to critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|Nina Leen's 1951 Life {{photograph}} {{has become}} the touchstone for canonical lists of the New York School.

For the next 60 years, the compound served as a training base for the Israel Defense Forces and an army clinic; at one point, it also served as headquarters for the Home Front Command.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{a growing}} {{business}} in online communications utilities, Delrina licensed Hilgraeve's HyperACCESS terminal emulator system in 1993, and <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{the basis for}} the initial version of its WinComm online communications software. The initial version of the product was originally bundled with WinFax as part of the Delrina Communications Suite, but in March 1994 was issued as a standalone product. It was a relative latecomer to the market, which was then dominated at the time by Datastorm's Procomm series of communications software.|$|E
5|$|The French Basque Country {{had been}} a {{favourite}} haven of ETA. Since mid-1968 most of ETA's leadership had lived there and <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a base for training, infrastructure and planning attacks. ETA commandos also operated from there, crossing the border into Spain to carry out attacks before fleeing back to France. This led to complaints in Spain that French authorities were {{not doing enough to}} tackle ETA activity, preferring to leave the Basque conflict to the Spanish to deal with.|$|E

5|$|The {{site has}} been {{inhabited}} for 6,000 years, first by hunter-gatherers {{and later by}} Khoikhoi herders. Both ethnic groups <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a place of worship and a site to conduct shamanist rituals. In the process of these rituals at least 2,500 items of rock carvings have been created, {{as well as a}} few rock paintings. Displaying one of the largest concentrations of rock petroglyphs in Africa, UNESCO approved Twyfelfontein as Namibia's first World Heritage Site in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} built for William Thomas Beckford, a rich novelist, art {{collector}} and critic, to designs by Henry Goodridge and completed in 1827. Beckford <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a library and a retreat, with the cupola at the top acting as a belvedere providing views over the surrounding countryside. The Italianate building {{at the base of}} the tower housed drawing rooms and a library. Extensive grounds between Beckford's house in Lansdown Crescent were landscaped and planted to create Beckford's Ride.|$|E

5|$|Tiny Town, in Springfield, Missouri, was {{the first}} city built in {{miniature}} and had over a thousand structures. A smaller village version was completed in 1919, while the larger full version was completed in 1925. It was motivated primarily by a local homebuilding promotion. The project involved 10,000 students from eighteen Springfield public high schools. The superintendent {{of the school system}} was a key instigator of the project and <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a teaching aid to instruct students in government, home-ownership and citizenship.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{site was}} found at 1601 W. First Street that had originally been constructed to house the Bonebrake Seminary. It was a three-story brick building built in 1879, and owned by the Dayton Board of Education, which <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a warehouse. Monsanto leased the site on 15 October 1943, and began converting it into a laboratory known as Unit III. New heating and lighting were installed, windows were replaced, new flooring was laid, and some rooms were re-plastered. A pair of guard houses known as buildings J and K were added, as was a chemical storage shed known as building F, and a wire fence. Laboratory activities were transferred there from Unit I on 25 September. In May 1945, five additional temporary buildings were constructed on land leased from the Board of Education that housed offices, a cafeteria, locker rooms, a physics laboratory and a laundry. A new guardhouse was also built. To this was added two portable buildings in 1946.|$|E
5|$|After Juan Ponce de León {{began the}} {{colonization}} process of Puerto Rico, the archipelago became a strategic military location, used by Spain {{to protect its}} colonies and possessions in America. Vessels <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a main point for resupplying before attempting long voyages and trading became {{a key part of}} economy. However, when the mines and rivers in the main island of Puerto Rico, then known as San Juan Bautista, were depleted Puerto Rico began suffering from shortage of gold and its income was reduced drastically, precipitating a recession. Beginning in the 16th century, the Spanish Crown was forced to issue a monetary support decree to the archipelago known as situado, which was supplied by the Royal banks in Central America, particularly Mexico. However, this aid failed to arrive often, contributing to the economical instability. This was exacerbated by other factors, including the costs of running an efficient military and a lack of commercial prosperity. Natural conditions and disasters also contributed, multiplying the costs of maintaining fortresses while hurricanes damaged haciendas, destroying crops and shortening the amount of laborers.|$|E

5|$|After {{the camp}} was closed, the site {{eventually}} returned to its original state. Within a couple of years, all the structures had been removed, {{with the exception of}} the two sentry posts at the entrance, the cemetery monument, and the former Manzanar High School auditorium, which was purchased by the County of Inyo. The County leased the auditorium to the Independence Veterans of Foreign Wars, who <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a meeting facility and community theater until 1951. After that, the building was used as a maintenance facility by the Inyo County Road Department.|$|E
5|$|Although Collins <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a {{catharsis}} for her {{opposition to}} the Vietnam War, two years after her rendition, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, senior Scottish regiment of the British Army, recorded an instrumental version featuring a bagpipe soloist accompanied by a pipe and drum band. The tempo of their arrangement was slowed {{to allow for the}} bagpipes, but it was based on Collins': it began with a bagpipe solo introduction similar to her lone voice, then it was accompanied by the band of bagpipes and horns, whereas in her version she is backed up by a chorus. It topped the RPM national singles chart in Canada for three weeks, and rose as high as number 11 in the U.S. It is also a controversial instrumental, as it combined pipes with a military band. The Pipe Major of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards was summoned to Edinburgh Castle and chastised for demeaning the bagpipes. Funeral processions for killed police, fire, and military personnel have often played a bagpipes version ever since.|$|E
5|$|Although {{most of the}} defences were {{in place}} by the time of Ranulph's death in 1232, there were no living quarters, and neither were there on the death of Ranulph's {{successor}} John in 1237. John died without a male heir, allowing King Henry III to take over the Earldom of Cheshire. Henry enlarged Beeston Castle during his wars with Wales, and <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a prison for his Welsh captives. No attempt was made to equip the castle as a permanent residence with halls and chambers; garrisons were probably housed in wooden structures within the outer bailey.|$|E
