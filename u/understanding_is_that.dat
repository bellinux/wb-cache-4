5|$|According to Clan MacLeod tradition, Leod {{inherited}} {{some of his}} lands from {{a foster}} father, who was a sheriff of the Hebridean island of Skye; other lands he inherited from his father-in-law, {{who was also a}} lord on Skye. MacLeod tradition also states that Leod was the father of four sons and two daughters. Two of these sons founded the two main branches of MacLeods; branches which exist to this day—Tormod (from whom the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan descend) and Torquil (from whom the MacLeods of Lewis descend). The traditional belief that Torquil was a son has also been challenged; the current <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he was a great-grandson of Leod. In recent years, the DNA evidence of men bearing surnames equating to MacLeod has revealed that a certain proportion share a common ancestor—an ancestor considered to have been the clan's founder.|$|E
25|$|Complementarians' <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> both Old and New Testaments do {{prescribe}} a male-priority based {{hierarchy and}} gender {{roles in the}} church and in marriage, where women have equal dignity with men but subordinate roles.|$|E
25|$|Exactly how pain-temperature fibers {{from the}} face are {{distributed}} to the spinal trigeminal nucleus is disputed. The present general <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> pain-temperature information from {{all areas of the}} human body is represented in the spinal cord and brainstem in an ascending, caudal-to-rostral fashion. Information from the lower extremities is represented in the lumbar cord, and that from the upper extremities in the thoracic cord. Information from the neck and {{the back of the head}} is represented in the cervical cord, and that {{from the face}} and mouth in the spinal trigeminal nucleus.|$|E
50|$|The general <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the formula}} had been worn out and <b>that</b> the show <b>was</b> {{out of new}} ideas and had been for sometime. Most {{believed}} {{that it should have}} been cancelled in 2000, after the end of its fifth season, which had been considered rather faulty.|$|R
50|$|The <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> each elder, {{with his}} co-presbyters and deacons, should have charge of 500 adult communicants in his district, making one church have 3000 members, {{corresponding}} {{to the number of}} converts at the first preaching of the Gospel in Acts. This could be only partially carried into practice.|$|R
50|$|Since first {{documented}} by Shaw in 1801, the general <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> northern flying squirrels bred but once per year. Recently, in southern Ontario, Canada, polyestrus behaviour (two litters per year) {{has been documented}} for the first time. This observation has since been confirmed by a second research team in New Brunswick, Canada.|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} of celiac disease, the current <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> tTG {{autoimmunity}} arises when T-cells are generated against wheat gliadin and similar gluten proteins made by a class of grasses called Triticeae, which includes wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye. The T-cells are defined by the ability to react to HLA-DQ8 and DQ2.5 restricted antigens and gliadin {{is one of the}} antigens. Gliadin is a favored dietary substrate for transglutaminase because of many enzyme reaction sites on gliadin. In disease, transglutaminase reacts with gliadin forming a linkage. In forming this bond transglutaminase becomes linked to T-cell epitopes on gliadin. B-cells with surface IgM that react to transglutaminase can present it with bound gliadin peptides to T-cells which stimulate B-cell maturation and proliferation to plasma cells making IgA or IgM.|$|E
25|$|Deuteronomy {{occupies}} a puzzling {{position in the}} Bible, linking {{the story of the}} Israelites' wanderings in the wilderness to the story of their history in Canaan without quite belonging totally to either. The wilderness story could end quite easily with Numbers, and the story of Joshua's conquests could exist without it, at least {{at the level of the}} plot; but in both cases there would be a thematic (theological) element missing. Scholars have given various answers to the problem. The Deuteronomistic history theory is currently the most popular (Deuteronomy was originally just the law code and covenant, written to cement the religious reforms of Josiah, and later expanded to stand as the introduction to the full history); but there is an older theory which sees Deuteronomy as belonging to Numbers, and Joshua as a sort of supplement to it. This idea still has supporters, but the mainstream <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Deuteronomy, after becoming the introduction to the history, was later detached from it and included with Genesis-Exodus-Leviticus-Numbers because it already had Moses as its central character. According to this hypothesis, the death of Moses was originally the ending of Numbers, and was simply moved from there to the end of Deuteronomy.|$|E
500|$|The Huygens probe landed {{just off}} the easternmost tip of a bright region now called Adiri. The probe photographed pale hills with dark [...] "rivers" [...] running down to a dark plain. Current <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the hills (also {{referred}} to as highlands) are composed mainly of water ice. Dark organic compounds, created in the upper atmosphere by the ultraviolet radiation of the Sun, may rain from Titan's atmosphere. They are washed down the hills with the methane rain and are deposited on the plains over geological time scales.|$|E
5000|$|The dissenting arbitrator, however, {{concluded}} that a reasonable person in Transfield's position would not have understood he was assuming liability for {{the risk of the}} type of loss that occurred.

60|$|It {{was nearly}} noon, and the <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> each one should get his dinner {{and go to}} the pasture again, when it would be known whether they were to be able to number Chandler Merrill's pony among the attractions of their show, or be wholly {{dependent}} upon the disabled horses that as yet made up their collection.|$|R
5000|$|Several Canadian {{companies}} are also pulling {{their support for}} Canadian Television Fund (CTF) because, [...] "(It) was never intended as a permanent source of funding" [...] to subsidize broadcasters and programmers. One Canadian company stated <b>that,</b> [...] "Our <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> after the initial five-year period, the fund would be self-sustaining and self-financing from a return on investment in successful productions." ...|$|R
500|$|The Viking {{image in}} popular <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of hypermasculinity, and thus Viking metal is {{inherently}} patriarchal. While some bands, such as Kivimetsän Druidi, Storm, and Irminsul, have included female members, and female fans comprise {{a substantial part}} of Viking metal's audience, it is argued that women are subordinated within the Viking metal scene, and are rarely present in the production of Viking metal music, which {{can be seen as a}} form of [...] "nation-building": while women may participate in the nation building process, it is still controlled by men. Within Viking metal, themes of war and masculinity predominate.|$|E
500|$|The Manx Sword of State, a {{ceremonial}} sword {{used at the}} annual Tynwald Day sittings at St John's, Isle of Man, and whenever the Tynwald sits at the Legislative Chambers in Douglas, Isle of Man, is popularly said to have belonged to Óláfr. The sword, which has a [...] steel blade and [...] inch hardwood hilt, is sometimes {{said to have been}} brought back from Spain when Óláfr returned from his pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela; however, recent analysis of the sword has determined that it dates no earlier than the 15th century, and that the blade dates only to the 17th century. The current <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the sword itself was made for the Tynwald meetings of 1417 or 1422.|$|E
500|$|Captain F. W. L. Thomas, a 19th-century antiquarian, {{proposed}} that Ljótólfr was the eponymous progenitor of Clan MacLeod. However, today the accepted <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the clan's eponymous ancestor is another man, Leod, who flourished about {{a century after}} Ljótólfr. Leod's name, and the modern surname MacLeod, {{are considered to be}} ultimately derived from the Old Norse personal name Ljótr. This name is derived from the Old West Norse word ljótr, meaning [...] "foul", [...] "ugly", [...] "misshapen". The personal name Ljótólfr is composed of two elementsthe first, liút, is derived from the Germanic word meaning [...] "light", [...] "shining"; the second element, ólfr, is derived from a Germanic word meaning [...] "wolf". While the current understanding of Leod's ancestry does not include a man named Ljótólfr, the 20th-century clan historian Alick Morrison considered it possible that Ljótólfr could be an ancestor of Leod, albeit on his distaff side; Morrison even suggested that Leod's name could have been derived from Ljótólfr.|$|E
50|$|There is some {{question}} about the date, or dates, of the painting. Original <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the painting <b>was</b> begun in 1505, fitting with Raphael's style at that time, strongly influenced by Perugino. Careful observation revealed <b>that</b> the painting <b>was</b> dated 1507. One can fairly reasonably assume, though, based upon the Raphael's style, that the work began in 1505 and was finished in 1507.|$|R
50|$|The Editors Committee is an {{informal}} forum comprising the editors and {{owners of the}} main Israeli media. It meets regularly with the prime minister, cabinet members and senior officials. Until the 1980s, it took {{a central role in}} the self-censorship practiced by the Israeli media. The <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the information reported to the committee would not be published in the media, even once received from another source.|$|R
50|$|Prior <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> all {{ritual and}} civil {{law in the}} Pentateuch (Books of Moses) had {{originated}} at Mt. Sinai; Bible history being {{the story of how}} the Hebrews would follow or not a comprehensive moral order 231-232. Yet from the Bible text, the author demonstrates how ritual law was initially ignored after Moses 259; only much later, following the return from exile, was the ritual system established under Ezra 226-227.|$|R
500|$|A more {{fundamental}} {{problem lies in}} the chaotic nature of the partial differential equations that govern the atmosphere. It is impossible to solve these equations exactly, and small errors grow with time (doubling about every five days). Present <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this chaotic behavior limits accurate forecasts to about 14 days even with perfectly accurate input data and a flawless model. [...] In addition, the partial differential equations used in the model need to be supplemented with parameterizations for solar radiation, moist processes (clouds and precipitation), heat exchange, soil, vegetation, surface water, {{and the effects of}} terrain. [...] In an effort to quantify the large amount of inherent uncertainty remaining in numerical predictions, ensemble forecasts have been used since the 1990s to help gauge the confidence in the forecast, and to obtain useful results farther into the future than otherwise possible. This approach analyzes multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model or multiple models.|$|E
500|$|Dogmeat was {{inspired}} by the unnamed dog of Max Rockatansky (Mad Max) from the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2. His initial name had been [...] "Dogshit" [...] and his ultimate name was derived from the opening scene of the 1975 post-apocalyptic film A Boy and His Dog, in which the main character Vic calls his dog Blood [...] "dog meat". According to Fallout producer, lead programmer and designer Tim Cain, [...] "Leonard Boyarsky, the [...] art director ... had that movie running continuously in his office, and I think he remarked on several occasions that having a dog in the game would be really cool. [...] why we wanted a dog in the first place." [...] Fallout programmer and designer Jesse Heinig was credited by Cain as probably [...] "one person to thank for Dogmeat." [...] Heinig himself said: [...] "My <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] Scott Bennie settled on the name 'Dogmeat' for the character, and it's likely that he did pick that from the story in question." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{reply to}} the committee's request that she define the term [...] "covert", she replied: [...] "I'm not a lawyer, but my <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the CIA is taking affirmative {{steps to ensure that}} there is no links between the {{operations}} officer and the Central Intelligence Agency." ...|$|E
5000|$|In July 1919, a {{newspaper}} reported, [...] "Veteran Harry Davis has been coaxed {{out of his}} retirement and has been made assistant manager of the Athletics." [...] Although Connie Mack was the team's manager, the report said, [...] "Mack hereafter will devote {{most of his time}} to business affairs of the club" [...] and <b>that</b> the <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Davis [...] "really is in full charge of the team." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although no {{official}} word came from Mackie officials, user <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the project had been discontinued, as no updates, communication or announcements had been forthcoming {{from the company}} since January 2008. However, at the January 2013 NAMM show Tracktion was reborn through original developer Julian Storer, who {{announced that he had}} re-acquired control of the software and would be developing Tracktion with his newly founded [...] "Tracktion Software Company" [...] (http://www.tracktion.com).|$|R
50|$|The {{question}} of stable, non-radioactive isotopes {{was more difficult}} and required the development by Francis Aston of a high-resolution mass spectrograph, which allowed the separation of different stable isotopes of {{one and the same}} element. Francis Aston was awarded the 1922 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this achievement. With his enunciation of the whole-number rule, Aston solved a problem that had riddled chemistry for a hundred years. The <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> different isotopes of a given element would be chemically identical.|$|R
2500|$|A {{practitioner}} of this tradition is nowadays {{known as a}} [...] (...) , or, in earlier usage, a dervish. The origin of the word [...] "Sufi" [...] is ambiguous. One <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Sufi means wool-wearer; wool wearers during early Islam were pious ascetics who withdrew from urban life. Another explanation of the word [...] "Sufi" [...] is that it means 'purity'.|$|E
2500|$|According to the BBC’s Pat Murphy: “My <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it {{came from}} the mid-sixties and a guy called Grahame Corling, who used to open the bowling for New South Wales and Australia … {{apparently}} the suggestion was that this guy's wife was [...] with another team-mate, and when he came into bat [...] started singing When a Man Loves A Woman, the old Percy Sledge number.” ...|$|E

6000|$|There {{were some}} {{children}} who straggled {{up with the}} party, who offered us flowers and crystals [...] "au plaisir" [...] to about the same intent and purpose. This cortége of people, wanting to sell you something, accompanies you every where in the Alps. The guides generally look upon it with complacency, and in a quiet way favor it. I suppose <b>that</b> the fact <b>was,</b> these were neighbors and acquaintances, and the mutual <b>understanding</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> they should help each other.|$|R
5000|$|According to the court, [...] "A fair {{reading of}} the child's {{testimony}} discloses that he clearly expected {{to be paid for}} his efforts." [...] His mother [...] "testified <b>that</b> her <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the child <b>was</b> going to be paid for what he did. Although she told Schneiderman originally that Shane would work without being paid, he rejected this offer and told both her and the child that he would pay Shane for his work. She believed that Schneiderman paid Shane a dollar a day." ...|$|R

2500|$|In ancient times, {{although}} some strong and healthy people lived {{until they were}} over 70 most died before they were 50. The general <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> those who lived into their 40's were treated with respect and awe. In contrast, those who were frail were seen as a burden and ignored or in extreme cases killed. People were defined as [...] "old" [...] because of their inability to perform useful tasks rather than their years.|$|E
2500|$|It was the Europeans who {{promoted}} an epistemological {{understanding of}} the map {{as early as the}} 17th century. An example of this <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> [...] " [...] reality can be expressed in mathematical terms; that systematic observation and measurement offer the only route to cartographic truth…". 17th century map-makers were careful and precise in their strategic approaches to maps based on a scientific model of knowledge. Popular belief at the time was that this scientific approach to cartography was immune to the social atmosphere.|$|E
2500|$|A {{traditional}} Catholic <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the temptation}} of Christ was a literal and physical event. [...] "Despite the difficulties urged, ... against the historical character of the three temptations of Jesus, as recorded by St. Matthew and St. Luke, it is plain that these sacred writers intended to describe an actual and visible approach of Satan, to chronicle an actual shifting of places, etc., and that the traditional view, which maintains the objective nature of Christ's temptations, {{is the only one}} meeting all the requirements of the Gospel narrative." ...|$|E
5000|$|The [...]325 WSM {{uses the}} [...]300 WSM case necked up {{to accept the}} 8mm bullet. The {{cartridge}} was influenced by contemporary cartridge designs calling for a short, fat cartridge operating at high pressures which could be cycled through a short action rifle. The <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> such cartridges would provide greater efficiency and uniformity in burning the powder charge which in turn would promote a greater inherent accuracy of the cartridge. The rebated rim design allows for the cartridge to utilize actions chambered for rifles based on the [...]375 Holland & Holland bolt face diameter.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You must be aware, Mr Melmotte,' {{said the}} lawyer, 'that {{the sale of}} a {{property}} is not like an ordinary mercantile transaction in which bills are customarily given and taken.

And when we learned, as we did learn, that the property had been at once mortgaged by you, of course we became,--well, I think I may be justified in saying more than suspicious.

50|$|Just {{before the}} filing of {{nominations}} {{came to an end}} for the Odisha Assembly elections of 2000, Mohapatra was expelled from the BJD and denied a ticket to contest the Patkura Assembly constituency by Naveen Patnaik. It <b>is</b> speculated <b>that</b> leaders like Pyarimohan Mohapatra had a role behind the ouster of Bijoy. Bijoy proceeded to support Trilocahan Behera of the Trinamool Congress, who won the seat by more than 40,000 votes over Atanu Sabyasachi, the official BJD nominee. The <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Behera would vacate the seat for Bijoy, if he elected as the Chief Minister of the state.|$|R
