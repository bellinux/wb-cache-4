5|$|For {{people who}} are <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> unable to take {{medication}} regularly, long-acting depot preparations of antipsychotics {{may be used to}} achieve control. They reduce the risk of relapse to a greater degree than oral medications. When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they may improve long-term adherence to treatment. The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping antipsychotics in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|Turmoil {{marked the}} {{legislative}} sessions of Brown's term; his supporters had been either <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> unable {{to influence the}} rest of the Democratic slate, and tensions over the currency issue soon split the administration. Attorney General William Jackson Hendricks, Treasurer Henry S. Hale, and Auditor Luke C. Norman were all free silver supporters and feuded with Brown and his (appointed) secretary of state, John W. Headley, throughout Brown's term. Over time, the rift deepened and spread to the entire Democratic party. Brown also frequently clashed with the legislature and vetoed several of the bills it passed; none of his vetoes were ever overridden.|$|E
5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. His hands were tied behind his back, and a rope was tied {{from his hands}} to a post in the ground. A large fire was lit {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{upstream}} from Casper, the North Platte bends to the south. The original trail proceeded several {{miles along the}} river to Red Buttes, where {{a bend in the}} river formed a natural amphitheater dominated by red cliffs on the hill above. The river was easier to ford here for those who were <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> unable to pay to cross at one of the ferries downstream. This was the last good camp spot before leaving the river and entering the waterless stretch between the North Platte and the Sweetwater River. From here the settlers entered a difficult portion called Rock Avenue which moved from spring to spring across mostly alkaline soil and steep hills until it reached the Sweetwater River. Later settlers who had crossed to the northern side of the river at Casper would come to favor a route through a small valley called Emigrant Gap which headed directly to Rock Avenue, bypassing Red Buttes.|$|E
5|$|Dewhurst {{occasionally}} captained Trinidad in the Inter-Colonial Tournament and was {{a candidate}} to captain the West Indies cricket team in England in 1928, when the two most likely men were <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> unable to lead the team. Dewhurst had acted as vice-captain of the West Indies team in 1926 to Harold Austin, but in the event, Karl Nunes was selected as captain. Dewhurst was also overlooked as vice-captain in favour of Vibart Wight although the latter had no captaincy experience. Dewhurst was named in the team to tour England, but he withdrew. Some newspaper reports blamed illness for his decision, others suggested business reasons. Critics believed that Dewhurst's absence adversely affected the team; the replacement wicket-keepers were not regarded as equal to Dewhurst's ability, and the vice-captain had little success. It was suggested that Dewhurst only missed the tour because {{he had not been}} chosen as vice-captain.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E

5|$|In August 1982, he fronted a {{consortium}} – funded by Saudi brothers Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti {{of the company}} Allied Properties – that took Wolverhampton Wanderers out of liquidation, beating a rival bid from Doug Ellis. The brothers wanted anonymity, and were only revealed to the public after investigation by journalists. He sacked manager Ian Greaves and replaced him with former Wolves teammate Graham Hawkins. However the council rejected planning permission for the club to construct a supermarket, and the Bhattis were <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> unable to provide further funding for the club. Wolves won promotion out of the Second Division in 1982–83, but were relegated out of the First Division in last place in 1983–84, and Dougan sacked Hawkins and replaced him with Tommy Docherty. Dougan resigned in January 1985.|$|E
5|$|Prince Paul {{recognised}} {{the lack}} of national solidarity and political weakness of his country, and after he assumed power he made repeated attempts to negotiate a political settlement with Maček, {{the leader of the}} dominant Croat political party in Yugoslavia, the HSS. In January 1937, Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović met with Maček at Prince Paul's request, but Stojadinović was <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> unable to grapple with the issue of Croat dissatisfaction with a Yugoslavia dominated by the Serb ruling class. In 1938, the Anschluss brought the Third Reich to the borders of Yugoslavia, and early elections were held in December. In this background, the Royal Yugoslav Air Force (VVKJ) commander, General Dušan Simović had been involved in two coup plots in early 1938 driven by Serb opposition to the Concordat with the Vatican, and another coup plot following the December election.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{was kept}} secluded {{by his wife}} and {{personal}} physician and only his close advisers were allowed to see him; none would divulge official information on his condition. Although Marshall sought to meet with Wilson to personally determine his condition, {{he was unable to}} do so, and relied on vague updates he received through a few bulletins published by Wilson's physician. Believing that Wilson and his advisers would not voluntarily transfer power to the vice president, a group of Congressional leaders initiated Marshall's requested joint resolution. The senators opposed to the League of Nations treaty, however, believed that as president Marshall would make several key concessions that would allow the treaty to win ratification. Wilson, in his present condition, was either <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> unable to make the concessions, and debate on the bill had resulted in a deadlock. In order to prevent the treaty's ratification, the anti-League senators blocked the joint resolution.|$|E

A low point came in 1177 with a successful raid into the heart of Connacht by a party of Anglo-Normans, led by one of Ruaidrí's sons, Prince Muirchertach. They were expelled, Ruaidhrí ordering the blinding of Muirchertach, but {{over the next six years}} his rule was increasingly diminished by internal dynastic conflict and external attacks. Finally, in 1183, he abdicated.|$|E
50|$|The {{point is}} {{sometimes}} made, however, that, {{even under the}} 100% system, the availability of an increased volume of circulating medium would not necessarily assure a correspondingly increased use of money.

The Palestinian movement quickly squandered its influence with the Shi'ite, as radical factions ruled by the gun in much of Shi'ite-inhabited southern Lebanon, where the refugee camps happened to be concentrated, and the mainstream PLO proved either <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> unable to rein them in.|$|E
