A country life and breeding had preserved in them all a look which Mary hesitated to call either innocent or youthful, as she compared them, now sitting round in an oval, softly illuminated by candlelight; and yet it was something of the kind, yes, even {{in the case of the}} Rector himself. Though superficially marked with lines, his face was a clear pink, and his blue eyes had the long-sighted, peaceful expression of eyes seeking the turn of the road, or a distant light through rain, or the darkness of winter. She looked at Ralph. He had never appeared to her more concentrated and full of purpose; as if behind his forehead were massed so much experience that he could choose for himself which part of it he would display and which part he would keep to himself.

40|$|Dry {{concrete}} {{is basically}} a cementitious material, consisting of aggregates imbedded in a cement matrix that function as the binding agent. The water cement factor during this production is customary kept low, since from the economic point of view, speed in production is favored. A low water-cement-factor {{will result in a}} faster <b>unmolding</b> of elements. As a consequence, the probability of the hydration process is not at optimum. A technique of optimizing the hydration process is to apply a compression stress to the dry concretes, during the hydration stage. This stress is aimed to reduce the air voids in the mixture and to enable the entrapped water within the mortar to optimize the reaction with the cement. The application of compression stress is not only freed the entrapped water, but also creates a more dense material so it will provides a better performance of the dry concrete. This study uses 2 types of mix design with a water-cement ratio of 0. 4 and 9 types of compressive stress variations during the production process from 0 MPa to 40 MPa. The experimental test showed that the compressive stress during the production process affect the compressive strength of dry concrete. The greater compressive stress given during the production process increase the compressive strength of the dry concrete. This increase occurred gradually until it reaches the optimum compressive stress, which is 35 MPa. The rate of increase in compressive strength and the optimum compressive stress on both the mix design is in the same point, it is due to both the mix design using the same water-cement ratio...|$|R

50|$|The {{next year}} George Pullman, the railroad-car {{entrepreneur}} {{who had lived}} in Albion as a young cabinetmaker during the late 1840s and into the 1850s, agreed to build a Universalist church in the village (named Pullman Memorial Universalist Church). He commissioned Solon Spencer Beman, who had designed his company town outside Chicago. Beman saw that the Medina sandstone was particularly well-suited to the Richardsonian Romanesque style, and produced a compact church of rough-hewn blocks of that material, with <b>unmolded</b> window trim revealing the thickness of the face. While it uses pointed arches instead of the round ones Richardson preferred, the tower evokes the older architect's Trinity Church in Boston. The interior echoes Richardson as well in contrasting the exterior's heaviness and seriousness with space and bright color, including the Tiffany stained glass window and golden oak ceiling beams.|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Solon S. Beman in the syle of Old English Gothic with Richardsonian Romanesque features. Its long, low horizontal profile outside and its arrangement and general layout inside anticipate modern architectural trends several decades later. [...] Beman found rough hewn locally quarried Medina pink sandstone complimentary to the simple forms and heavy proportions of the Richardsonian style. The result is a compact, centralized building with a tower reminiscent of that over the crossing of Richardson's Trinity Church (1872) in Boston. Beman's use of unpolished stone pierced by <b>unmolded</b> windows that reveal {{the thickness of the}} fabric, added to the overall composition of distinct units unified by strong horizontality and subordination to the crossing tower conform to Richardsonian tradition. The main entrance is made of a series of stone moldings, with oak plank doors and decorative wrought iron hinges.

40|$|During this study, we {{examined}} the effects of using molded orthotics on persons who had suffered an inversion ankle sprain. We assessed standing balance with a digital balance evaluator for a group of 15 subjects who had no history of ankle sprains and for a group of nine subjects with acute ankle sprains. Then, we assessed the subjective pain experienced by ten subjects with acute ankle sprains while they jogged. During each part of the study, we tested the subjects while they were using a molded orthotic, an <b>unmolded</b> orthotic, and no orthotic in their shoes. We alternated the order of these treatments with each consecutive subject. The results indicate that subjects with a history of recent inversion ankle sprains had poorer balance than uninjured subjects. Molded orthotics had no effect on balance scores in the uninjured group, but their use improved balance scores in the ankle sprain group. <b>Unmolded</b> orthotics did not improve balance scores. Molded orthotics helped to decrease ankle pain during jogging for those with an ankle sprain, but <b>unmolded</b> orthotics did not. These findings suggest that molded orthotics {{may play a role in}} the treatment of inversion ankle sprains...|$|E

In the design an integrator is augmented to ensure the tracking with zero steady-state errors. Furthermore the sliding surface of acceleration is designed using the error of acceleration and acceleration rate to avoid the singularity of control matrix. A proper power rate reaching law is utilized in this proposal; therefore the state trajectory from any initial point can be driven into the sliding surface. Besides, in order to validate the robustness of controller, the <b>unmolded</b> dynamic and parameter disturbance of the missile are considered.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an adaptive sliding-mode control algorithm for uncertain nonlinear system. It {{is very difficult}} to obtain the exact knowledge and it is required to approximate an <b>unmolded</b> dynamics with a nonlinear component. Therefore, a fuzzy basis function network is applied to approximate the unknown dynamics of nonlinear system. The paper employs a weight factor to adjust the ratio of direct and indirect adaptive fuzzy control, meantime a supervisory controller is introduced and a sliding-mode controller is to ensure optimal tracking performance of the closed-loop system. To prevent the system state variables unpredictable, this paper designs an observer to estimate the unpredictable states. The control structure and learning rules are derived from a Lyapunov theory extension that guarantees both tracking errors and parameter estimate errors in the closed-loop system are bounded. A two-arm robot is simulated to verify the feasibility of the proposed control scheme...|$|E
40|$|An {{eclipse of}} the sun by the moon as seen by the Lageos {{satellite}} can affect the orbital semimajor axis at the centimeter level.

However, it was 17. 6 mm for the eclipses on 28 March 1979 and 11. 2 mm for the one on 15 December 1982. Differences such as these generate large enough along-track errors to make it worthwhile to include eclipses in complex orbit determination programs such as GEODYN which integrate the orbit.

40|$|A {{complete}} {{methodology for}} an unmanned coaxial rotor helicopter with unstructured uncertainties was proposed to achieve high-accuracy tracking performance from modelling to robust control. An integrative approach {{was introduced to}} systematically construct a whole dynamic model. The key parameters were selected carefully after iteratively being checked by empirical coefficients to decrease the budget and risk of programme. Moreover, a new control scheme is proposed to simultaneously incorporate six inputs to control six states based on the investment of singularity value responses and the general rule of relative gain array. Coprime factor uncertainty model is considered to represent a class of unstructured uncertainties, such as <b>unmolded</b> actuator dynamics and unpredicted interferences between two rotors. Furthermore, the H ∞ loop-shaping control was proposed to apply the control design of the coaxial rotor helicopter to manage complicated uncertainties and multivariable coupling. Finally, simulation results show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed controller design in the step response of the closed loop. The stable closed-loop plant is achieved and the tolerant size of unstructured uncertainty is up to 36. 09 %. Good step responses and satisfied decoupling were also investigated in detail...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The goal of {{the current}} study was to use {{computer-aided}} design and injection molding technologies to tissue engineer precisely shaped cartilage in the shape of butterfly tympanic membrane patches out of chondrocyte-seeded calcium alginate gels. METHODS: Molds were designed on SolidWorks 2000 and built out of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) using fused deposition modeling (FDM). Tympanic membrane patches were fabricated using bovine articular chondrocytes seeded at 50 x 10 cells/mL in 2 % calcium alginate gels. Molded patches were cultured in vitro for up to 10 weeks and assessed biochemically, morphologically, and histologically. RESULTS: <b>Unmolded</b> patches demonstrated outstanding dimensional fidelity, with a volumetric precision of at least 3 microL, and maintained their shape well for up to 10 weeks of in vitro culture. Glycosaminoglycan and collagen content increased steadily over 10 weeks in culture, demonstrating continual deposition of new extracellular matrix consistent with new tissue development. CONCLUSIONS: The use of computer-aided design and injection molding technologies allows for the fabrication of very small, precisely shaped chondrocyte-seeded calcium alginate structures that faithfully maintain their shape during in vitro culture. In vitro fabrication of tympanic membrane patches with a precisely controlled geometry may have the potential to provide a minimally invasive alternative to traditional methods for the repair of chronic tympanic membrane perforations...|$|E
40|$|Molding at parturition, äs {{perceived}} subjectively, {{ranges from}} no reshaping to marked {{distortion of the}} infant's head. While clinicians easily recognize,the highly molded head, there are no criteria for quantitating the degree of molding. The {{purpose of the present}} study is to describe quantitatively neonatal skull molding and the restitution of the newborn's skull from the molded state during the early neonatal period. l Literature review In 1907, STUMPF [13] studied the restitution of molding in the neonatal period. Measurements of two head circumferences of vaginally delivered infants were compared to control infants delivered by cesarean section, assumed to be <b>unmolded.</b> He concluded that the plane of the suboccipito-bregmatic diameter was the presenting plane in labor, and that molding was a result of interaction of the head with soft tissues rather than the bony pelvis. Both the suboccipitobregmatic and sub-occipitofrontal diameters increased during restitu-tion. HOLLAND [5], in 1922, described cranial stress during labor and the relationship of excessive stress to tentorial tearsand subdural cerebralhemorrhage. He wrote that tension of the intracranial septa are inevitable äs the head undergoes molding.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a framework for}} robust parameter estimation in multipass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), such as persistent scatterer interferometry, SAR tomography, small baseline subset, and SqueeSAR. These techniques involve estimation of phase history parameters with or without covariance matrix estimation. Typically, their optimal estimators are derived on the assumption of stationary complex Gaussian-distributed observations. However, their statistical robustness has not been addressed with respect to observations with nonergodic and non-Gaussian multivariate distributions. The proposed robust InSAR optimization (RIO) framework answers two fundamental questions in multipass InSAR: 1) how to optimally treat images with a large phase error, e. g., due to <b>unmolded</b> motion phase, uncompensated atmospheric phase, etc.; and 2) how to estimate the covariance matrix of a non-Gaussian complex InSAR multivariate, particularly those with nonstationary phase signals. For the former question, RIO employs a robust M-estimator to effectively downweight these images; and for the latter, we propose a new method, i. e., the rank M-estimator, which is robust against non-Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, it can work without the assumption of sample stationarity, which is a topic that has not previously been addressed. We demonstrate {{the advantages of the}} proposed framework for data with large phase error and heavily tailed distribution, by comparing it with state-of-the-art estimators for persistent and distributed scatterers. Substantial improvement can be achieved in terms of the variance of estimates. The proposed framework can be easily extended to other multipass InSAR techniques, particularly to those where covariance matrix estimation is vital...|$|E
