25|$|Under {{the spell}} of {{liberalization}} promoted by the new communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu, Ivașcu {{became a member of}} the Academy of Social and Political Sciences. In 1969 and 1971, he received the Romanian Writers' Union Prize. From 1971 until his death, Ivașcu directed România Literară, the Writers' <b>Union</b> <b>magazine.</b> According to Manolescu, who was to succeed him there, the move from Contemporanul to România Literară was rather a demotion, signaling that Ceaușescu did not trust him. Others contrarily note that Ceaușescu handpicked Ivașcu to direct the magazine after the fall from favor of a previous editor, Nicolae Breban. Breban had made public his criticism of the July Theses, through which Ceaușescu had reintroduced hardline Marxism-Leninism.|$|E
25|$|In 1848, {{after some}} {{financial}} difficulties caused by poor copper investments, Graham sold the magazine to Samuel Dewee Patterson, though he retained {{the title of}} editor. Sartain, whose engravings had become {{an important part of}} Graham's, left to found his own journal, Sartain's <b>Union</b> <b>Magazine,</b> in 1849. People who sympathized with Graham's difficulties helped him regain some of his fortune and he bought back his interest in the magazine in 1850. Competition with Harper's New Monthly Magazine beginning in that year caused significant drops in subscriptions, as did the lack of an international copyright. Charles Godfrey Leland took over when Graham left the magazine in 1853 or 1854 and Graham's Magazine ceased publication in 1858.|$|E
500|$|After {{passing the}} {{entrance}} exam {{on his second}} attempt, in 1907 Wheeler was awarded a scholarship to read classical studies at University College London (UCL), commuting daily from his parental home to the university campus in Bloomsbury, central London. At UCL, he was taught by the prominent classicist A. E. Housman. During his undergraduate studies, he became editor of the <b>Union</b> <b>Magazine,</b> for which he produced a number of illustrated cartoons. Increasingly interested in art, he decided to switch from classical studies to a course at UCL's art school, the Slade School of Fine Art; {{he returned to his}} previous subject after coming to the opinion that – in his words – he never became more than [...] "a conventionally accomplished picture maker". This interlude had adversely affected his classical studies, and he received a second class BA on graduating.|$|E

It carries a preface by Babeți, and is a conscious attempt to reassess Bonciu {{as one of the}} major Romanian writers of his time. The reception was lukewarm and the iconoclastic intent criticized by other specialists. Ion Simuț notes that, unlike Blecher, [...] "H.

2500|$|The Teamsters {{began to}} expand {{dramatically}} and mature organizationally under Tobin.

[...] Varying in geographical and industrial jurisdiction, the joint councils became important incubators for up-and-coming leadership and negotiating master agreements which covered all employers in a given industry. As collective bargaining became the norm throughout the Teamsters, Tobin actively discouraged strikes in order to bring discipline to the union and encourage employers to sign contracts. Tobin also founded and edited (for a time) the <b>union</b> <b>magazine,</b> the International Teamster.|$|E

In that house, the first three of her five {{children}} were born, and there her public literary life began. In 1847, he sent one of her poems, without her knowledge, to the <b>Union</b> <b>Magazine,</b> and this was her first published poem. In the following year, her first published story, [...] "Isabel Leslie", gained a [...] prize offered by Sartain's Magazine. Edward Everett Hale and James Russell Lowell were also among the prize winners. The Dorr family then pulled up stakes {{and started for the}} far west by way of Rutland. The intended visit turned into something far different as they built a new home, “The Maples".|$|E
2500|$|Since the Romanian Revolution of 1989, he {{has been}} visiting his native country on a regular basis. Tismăneanu was in Bucharest during June 1990, {{witnessing}} the Mineriad, when miners from the Jiu Valley supporting the National Salvation Front put a violent stop to the Golani protest, an experience he claims gave him insight into [...] "barbarity in its crassest, most revolting, form." [...] Other sojourns included 1993-1994 research visits to the Communist Party archives, at the time supervised by the Romanian Army General Staff. Tismăneanu resumed his articles in the Romanian press, beginning with a series on communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, which was published by the Writers' <b>Union</b> <b>magazine</b> România Literară during the early 1990s. He contributed a weekly column in Jurnalul Național, before moving to Cotidianul, and was regularly published by other press venues: Revista 22, Idei în Dialog, and Orizont. He later began contributing to Observator Cultural and Evenimentul Zilei.|$|E

40|$|Congressional {{consideration}} of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993 drew intense labor lobbying. Unions acted to motivate members to contact their representatives and senators, including use of their magazines as advocacy and informational tools. <b>Union</b> <b>magazines,</b> which are little-studied but potentially influential advocacy tools, attacked the pact and urged readers to take political action. Their coverage focused on job-related critiques, especially predictions of a job drain to Mexico and lower wages for U. S. workers. Much less attention went to environmental and other perceived flaws of NAFTA. Language in those articles was frequently more heated than in the mainstream media. ...|$|R

2500|$|From 1930 to 1935, Stewart {{attended}} the privately run City of London School, meaning {{that he had}} to commute daily into the city from his rural home. It was here that he joined the Officer Training Corps, where he learned much about military strategy, {{but at the same time}} disapproved of militarism and began to sympathise with left wing politics that were at odds with his conservative upbringing. At 17, he became a socialist, before later taking a further leftist stance by declaring himself a communist and rejecting Christianity, instead defining himself as an [...] "interested agnostic". In 1935 he began attending University College London, where he studied journalism, and where he served both as president of the London University Journalism Union and editor of the London <b>Union</b> <b>Magazine.</b> After he ended his university education in 1937, he spent three months as an exchange student in Dresden, Germany, where he became fluent in German and also developed an even greater hatred of right wing Nazism than he already held.|$|E
2500|$|Nu's {{political}} life started {{as president of}} the Rangoon University Students Union (RUSU) with Mr. M. A. Rashid as Vice-President and [...] as the General Secretary. Aung San was Editor and Publicity Officer. Nu and Aung San were both expelled from the university after an article, Hell Hound Turned Loose, appeared in the <b>union</b> <b>magazine,</b> which was obviously about the Rector. Their expulsion sparked off the second university students' strike in February 1936. Aung San and Nu became members of the nationalist Dobama Asiayone (We Burmans Association) which had been formed in 1930 and henceforth gained the prefix Thakin ('Master'), proclaiming they were the true masters of their own land. For a few years after independence in 1948 Nu retained the prefix 'Thakin', but around 1952 he announced that since Burma was already independent the prefix of 'Thakin' was no longer needed and henceforth he would be known as U ('Mr') Nu. In 1937 he co-founded with Thakin Than Tun the Nagani (Red Dragon) Book Club which for the first time widely circulated Burmese-language translations of the Marxist classics. He also became a leader and co-founder of the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP), which later became the Socialist Party, and the umbrella organisation the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL), which advocated Burmese independence from both Japanese and British control during the 1940s. He was detained by the colonial government in 1940 along with Thakin Soe, Thakin Than Tun, Kyaw Nyein, U Măd, and Dr. Ba Maw. The prison holding Nu was largely abandoned by the British {{in the course of the}} rapid Japanese advance.|$|E
