The model M permits no non-trivial enrichment as a partial order; neither does it permit an enrichment as a category with an initial object. The open term model embeds in M: by way of contrast we provide a model which cannot embed in any non-trivial model separating all pairs of distinct elements. 1 Introduction Separability is a recurring topic in the -calculus. It is usually defined syntactically; {{there is also an}} interesting model-theoretic definition. Say that a subset A of an applicative structure (X; Δ) is separable if any function f : A ! X is realised by some f in X, by which is meant, that for all a in A, f(a) = f Δ a. This idea first appears in work of Flagg and Myhill [FM].

40|$|Abstract. Using the <b>terminology</b> <b>usual</b> in databases, it is {{possible}} to view XML as a language for data modelling. To retrieve XML data from XML databases, several query languages have been proposed. The common feature of these languages is the usage of regular path expressions. Users are allowed to navigate through arbitrary long paths in the data by regular path expressions. Several index structures for XML data have been developed in recent years in order to address the problem. The paper is going to show how the UB-trees can index and retrieve XML documents efficiently. UB-trees were introduced by R. Bayer as a structure for indexing n-dimensional space. The basic idea of UB-tree index is that the indexing is performed at the lowest level of the given XML data. Key words: XML, indexing XML, index data structures, UB-tree...|$|R

In addition, there are affective phenomena not captured in the <b>usual</b> taxonomy and <b>terminology,</b> which nevertheless deserve our attention. Some of them have recently been called existen-tial feelings (I will introduce them in the next section).

This paper introduces a geometric framework for indexing and querying XML data conceived in this way. In consequence, we can use certain data structures for indexing multidimensional points (objects). We use the UB-tree for indexing the vector spaces and the M-tree for indexing the metric spaces. The data structures for indexing the vector spaces lead rather to exact matching queries while the structures for indexing the metric spaces allow us to provide the similarity queries...|$|R

As mentioned above, this alters the competitive situation of at least eight surrounding trees. Using simply the growing space defined by a tree’s position on a certain spoke and circle therefore does obviously not reflect its competitive status correctly under such conditions. We therefore include competition indices, which quantify the local density around a tree (Biging and Dobbertin 1992, 1995) into the evaluation of Nelder designs. Using the term competition index, we follow the <b>usual</b> <b>terminology,</b> although a given local density and spatial constellation around a tree may cause not only competition but also facilitation, simultaneously. Especially in the early phase of stand development higher density and higher competition indices may be coupled with facilitation overcompensating competition.|$|E
40|$|Just {{like all}} the others {{specific}} learning disorders, dyspraxia is a key issue for public health and school performance. “Developmental dyspraxia” qualifies specific disturbances of gesture, i. e. the ability to produce a finalized action (goal-directed movement) and to use the objects [1, 2]. Even if dyspraxia was described for decades, the value of the concept for diagnosis raises some debates in the international literature. Since 1994, a consensus has been established on the diagnostic entity of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) to describe all children who exhibit developmental deficits of “motor coordination”. Beyond the <b>usual</b> debate of <b>terminology,</b> both the theoretical and the clinical definitions of the gestural dysfunctions in children remain insufficient in various respects. This communication provides a review of current controversies regarding the field of dyspraxia and DCD. Understanding the two entities of dyspraxia and DCD proves problematic, both when defining the concepts of praxis/motor coordination and when providing a theoretical analysis of the deficits they cover. More specifically, we aim at exploring the arguments supporting the hypothesis of a specific deficit in praxis development. We discuss the respective contributions of different impairment levels highlighted by studies of developmental gestural impairment (e. g. knowledge, executive functions, perceptive abilities…). Such a deconstruction of the concept of a specific deficit in praxis development argues in favor of an analysis that does not confuse gestural problems with other deficits made apparent through gesture...|$|R
50|$|Arnaut (ارناود), Arvanid (اروانيد), Arnavud (آرناوود), plural: Arnavudlar (آرناوودلار): modern Turkish: Arnavut, plural: Arnavutlar; are ethnoyms used {{mainly by}} Ottoman and {{contemporary}} Turks for Albanians with Arnavutça being {{the name of}} the Albanian language. These ethnonyms are derived from the Greek term Arvanites and entered Turkish after the syllable cluster van was rearranged through metathesis to nav giving the final Turkish forms as Arnavut and Arnaut. Meanwhile in Greek the name Arvanitis was derived from the original name Alvanitis Άλβανίτης (in return derived from Alvanos Άλβάνος). In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries due to socio-political disturbances by some Albanians in the Balkans the term was used as an ethnic marker for Albanians in addition to the <b>usual</b> millet religious <b>terminology</b> to identify people in Ottoman state records.

50|$|The Ottoman conquest {{also brought}} social, {{cultural}} and linguistic changes into the Albanian-speaking world. From {{the fifteenth century}} onward words from Ottoman Turkish entered the Albanian language. A corpus of poets and other Muslim Albanian authors wrote in Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, Persian or in the Albanian language in Arabic script (aljamiado) encompassing narrative prose, poetry, reflective works on religion and socio-political situations and so on. Prominent amongst these authors were Yahya bey Dukagjini, Haxhi Shehreti or bejtexhinj poets like Nezim Frakulla, Muhamet Kyçyku, Sulejman Naibi, Hasan Zyko Kamberi, Haxhi Ymer Kashari and others. Apart from Elbasan founded (1466) around a fortress, towns and cities in Albania underwent change as they adopted Ottoman architectural and cultural elements. Some settlements {{with the construction of}} buildings related to religion, education and social purposes like mosques, madrassas, imarets and so on by the Ottoman Muslim Albanian elite became new urban centres like Korçë, Tiranë and Kavajë. Meanwhile older urban centres such as Berat attained mosques, hamams (Ottoman bathhouses), madrasas (Muslim religious schools), coffee houses, tekes and became known for poets, artists and scholarly pursuits. Unlike Kosovo or Macedonia, architecturally Albania's Ottoman Muslim heritage was more modest in number, though prominent structures are the Mirahori Mosque in Korçë (built 1495-96), Murad Bey Mosque in Krujë (1533-34), Lead Mosque in Shkodër (1773-74), Et'hem Bey Mosque in Tiranë (begun 1791-94; finished 1820-21) and others. Conversion from Christianity to Islam for Albanians also marked a transition from Rum (Christian) to Muslim confessional communities within the Ottoman millet system that collectively divided and governed peoples according to their religion. The Ottomans were nonetheless aware of the existence of Muslim Albanians and used terms like Arnavud (اروانيد) extensively as an ethnic marker to address the shortcomings of the <b>usual</b> millet religious <b>terminology</b> to identify people in Ottoman state records. In Ottoman Turkish, the country was referred to as Arnavudluk (آرناوودلق). Also a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different Ottoman world emerging around them was a change in ethnonym. The ethnic demonym Shqiptarë, derived from Latin connoting clear speech and verbal understanding gradually replaced Arbëresh/Arbënesh amongst Albanian speakers between the late 17th and early 18th centuries.|$|R
