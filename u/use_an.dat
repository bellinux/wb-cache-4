5|$|A major {{point of}} {{consensus}} among all scholars of intellectual giftedness {{is that there}} is no generally agreed definition of giftedness. Although there is no scholarly agreement about identifying gifted learners, there is a de facto reliance on IQ scores for identifying participants in school gifted education programs. In practice, many school districts in the United States <b>use</b> <b>an</b> IQ score of 130, including about the upper 2 or 3 percent of the national population, as a cut-off score for inclusion in school gifted programs.|$|E

5|$|About {{the time}} of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to <b>use</b> <b>an</b> {{existing}} Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C. Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama, Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} that Hogeboom had murdered Fontaine and kidnapped Elsa, Phelps and Kelso pursue {{him into the}} Los Angeles River Tunnels as a heavy rain begins, fighting their way through corrupt policemen and thugs. The pair rescue Elsa, with Kelso killing Hogeboom to put {{him out of his}} mental anguish. With the water level rising, the group <b>use</b> <b>an</b> open manhole to escape, but Phelps is swept away in the current. Whilst the SRF scam is exposed, several members escape justice by making a deal with the Assistant D.A. to testify. They attend Phelps's funeral, each delivering eulogies to his memory, much to the disgust of Elsa. Biggs remarks to Kelso that Phelps was never his friend, to which Kelso agrees but responds that he was never Phelps' enemy.|$|E
5|$|All campsites {{accessible}} only on foot or by horseback are considered backcountry campsites {{and they are}} available by permit only, but camping is allowed {{in most of these}} backcountry zones year-round. The National Park Service has a combination of specific sites and zones for backcountry camping with a set carrying capacity of overnight stays per zone to protect the resources from overcrowding. Open fires are not permitted in the backcountry and all food must be stored in an Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee approved bear-resistant container. As of 2012, only four brands of bear-resistant containers had been approved for use in the Grand Teton National Park backcountry. Additionally, hikers may <b>use</b> <b>an</b> approved bear spray to elude aggressive bears.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{supporting}} roles, {{one of the}} highest-profile pieces of casting was Malcolm McDowell as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban {{as part of the}} first block of filming, as opposed {{to the rest of the}} production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to <b>use</b> <b>an</b> actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who rarely did television work.|$|E
5|$|An {{electronic}} {{toll collection}} system was proposed in 1990 where a motorist would create an account and <b>use</b> <b>an</b> electronic device which would be read from an electronic tollbooth; the motorist would be billed later. The multi-state electronic tolling system, E-ZPass, was planned to go into effect by 1998; however, implementation of the system was postponed until 2000.|$|E
5|$|Android 4.1.1, used {{in various}} {{portable}} devices.

5|$|As a point-and-click {{adventure}} game, {{the player}} controls Simon using the mouse. The iOS and Android versions feature touch-screen controls. Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with objects and other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving an item to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close an item. Some actions are binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon to <b>use</b> <b>an</b> item, needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 15th century, {{the cross}} {{with a double}} {{traverse}} is seen on the arms of archbishops, and relates to their processional cross and the jurisdiction it symbolizes. Except for cardinals of the Roman Curia, most cardinals head an archdiocese and <b>use</b> <b>an</b> archiepiscopal cross on their arms. Other cardinals use a simple Latin cross, as {{is found in the}} arms of Cardinal Joseph Zen, bishop emeritus of Hong Kong, because Hong Kong is not an archdiocese.|$|E
5|$|Bond later {{scales the}} walls to the Whyte House's top floor to confront Whyte. He is instead met by two {{identical}} Blofelds, who <b>use</b> <b>an</b> electronic device to sound like Whyte. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, {{which turns out to}} be a look-alike. The real Blofeld pulls a gun on Bond, and instructs him into a elevator, where he is knocked out by gas. He is picked up by Wint and Kidd, and taken out to Las Vegas Valley, where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. The pipeline is buried the next morning.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} gender stereotypes for leaders <b>using</b> <b>a</b> more indirect method than is typical in stereotype research. Rather than reveal the leader 2 ̆ 7 s gender, {{this study used}} vignettes in which the leader 2 ̆ 7 s gender was unknown. Consistent with their hypothesis, the authors found that participants {{were more likely to}} infer a male (female) gender identity than a female (male) gender identity when presented with <b>a</b> leader <b>using</b> <b>a</b> masculine (feminine) style. They also hypothesized that <b>a</b> leader <b>using</b> <b>a</b> gender-consistent leadership style would be viewed more positively than <b>a</b> leader <b>using</b> <b>a</b> gender-inconsistent style. Contrary to this hypothesis, results revealed that men <b>using</b> <b>a</b> gender-inconsistent (feminine) style were actually evaluated more positively than men <b>using</b> <b>a</b> gender-consistent style. It is interesting that a perceived female leader who <b>used</b> <b>a</b> gender-inconsistent (masculine) style was evaluated more positively than a perceived male leader who <b>used</b> <b>a</b> masculine style, but only by female participants. Possible explanations for these results are discussed...|$|R
