40|$|Technological {{advances}} present {{firms in}} many industries {{with opportunities to}} substantially improve their product's capabilities in short periods of time. Customers who invest in these products may, however, react adversely to rapid improvements that make their previous versions obsolete by deferring their purchase. In industrial markets, there is an emerging trend of sequentially improving products designed to be upgraded in a modular fashion. We study the impact of product architecture and introduction timing on the launch of rapidly improving products. We find that by localizing performance improvements in a sequence of upgradable modules of the product, a firm can better manage the introduction of rapidly improving products. Specifically, we show that modular <b>upgradability</b> can {{reduce the need for}} slowing the pace of innovation or forgoing upgrade pricing. The additional flexibility in pricing and timing makes the modular, upgradable approach preferable to an integrated architecture, even in some situations where there may be distinct performance or cost-related disadvantages to pursuing the modular architecture. We differentiate between proprietary and nonproprietary approaches to modular <b>upgradability</b> and consider the implications for profits.

40|$|AbstractEnvironmental issues due to {{emerging}} markets and rapid development of consumer goods’ consumption require {{a new model}} to design more sustainable products. While traditional eco-design methods (LCA, Check-lists, Guidelines, DfX tools…) are generally restricted to a local optimization of the product or to macro-rules for defining an environmental strategy, this article presents an eco-innovative method based on product <b>upgradability</b> which is the integration of functional enrichments on the product. Indeed, the integration of upgrades offers new opportunities for facilitating the dissemination of the remanufacturing approach, the dissemination of Product-Service Systems, or for increasing the lifetime of product. This article presents an eco-innovative method based on <b>upgradability</b> consisting in: exploring the potential upgrades of modules - PMoL (SADT activity A 4), the potential value network structures for <b>upgradability</b> - VaNS (A 3) and the potential serviceable upgrades including eco-learning strategies - SMoL (A 5). This method combines then the results PMoL, VaNS and SMoL to form promising Upgradable Modules Scenarios – UpMoS (A 6), which are completed by the specification of an associated value network (A 7) and the consolidation of eco-usage services and services offers (A 8). The final result obtained, Upgradable systems concepts– UpSys are then assessed thanks to a multicriteria approach (A 9) considering environmental, economic and user's and stakeholder's attractiveness criteria. To summarize, this method is structured in two rounds. The first round (A 3, A 4, A 5) aims to explore widely the possibilities offered by the <b>upgradability</b> avoiding the complexity of an approach dealing with several parameters simultaneously. The purpose of the second round (A 6, A 7, A 8, A 9) is to specify and assess Upgradable systems encompassing the overall results of the exploration. Before performing this work, relevant information needs to be collected for the project (market information, customer segments, technologies, stakeholders, environmental impacts of the current product, etc.) and acceptability domains of upgradable systems have to be analyzed (A 1, A 2).

40|$|International audienceConfronted {{with the}} {{accelerated}} product obsolescence {{and the resulting}} waste of materials, the concept of “optimised/increased/hybridised upgradability” is considered. In the literature, <b>upgradability</b> is used to respond to local technical problems (updating norms, update because of a broken component etc.) or as an end-of-life option. In our view however, it constitutes {{the heart of a}} new and promising paradigm of production/consumption. This paper proposes to consider hybrid systems that are called “Upgradable Product Service System (Up-PSS) ” combining <b>upgradability</b> with optimised maintenance, with valorisation of end-of-life parts and with the servicisation of the offer. The promises of increasing attractiveness for clients, new businesses for manufacturers and a host of environmental benefits make this new concept highly pertinent compared to known models of production/consumption such as remanufacturable products, easily recyclable products, PSS, optimal maintenance products or basic upgrade products. Moreover, Up-PSS is a new opportunity to switch to offers without ownership transfer that facilitates the implementation of circular economy. In order to shed light on the field of Up-PSS and investigate the boundaries of this new paradigm, three actions are carried out: (1) focus groups with consumers and workshops with two manufacturers (2) on the <b>upgradability</b> of real products and (3) on the changes in business models. Our action research approach resulted in clarifying this new concept of the product by defining key ideas based on three keystones: (i) upgrades should be scheduled according to regular cycles of successive lines of functional improvements to satisfy the following themes of value creation: utilitarian, emotional, ethical, and service-oriented. There should also be specific upgrades chosen from a catalogue; (ii) the effects are strong environmental gains from multiple principles of rationalisation materials use but also by encouraging users to eco-friendly usage of their products; this is formalised by an eco-score to which both users and producers are committed. (iii) The above are accompanied by continuous interaction between clients and manufacturers through a web platform, offers of upgradable systems that would integrate bundles of services resulting in the system's growing attractiveness in the eyes of clients. This in turn would set in motion new modes of contracts, offering manufacturers new and more frequent ways of earning revenue; this would be conditional on setting up an <b>upgradability</b> support service that would be attractive to clients as well as reorganising the value chain with the participation of new partners. This transformation of the value network over time implies developing new development paths for business models to facilitate the transition from current economic models centred on material goods to models that are more service oriented...|$|E
