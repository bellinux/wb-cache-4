5|$|Weston {{is close}} to {{junction}} 21 of the M5 motorway, {{to which it is}} linked by a dual-carriageway relief road built in the 1990s. This replaced Locking Road as the designated A370 route and avoided some of the traffic congestion along that narrower <b>urban</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E

However, road protests elsewhere had become increasingly visible, and <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> building had fallen out of favour with the public.

5|$|Farm to Market Road1938 (FM1938) is a Farm to Market Road in the US {{state of}} Texas. The highway runs from State Highway26 (SH26) to FM1709, in Tarrant County. While located in Westlake, FM1938 is named Precinct Line Road. While located in Southlake, from the {{northern}} border of Southlake to its junction with FM1709, FM1938 is named Randol Mill Avenue, and from the FM1709 intersection to its southern terminus, the highway is named Davis Boulevard. FM1938 was designated in 1952, in Hockley County, but was cancelled and redesignated in 1955, at its modern location in Tarrant County. In 1995, the entire route of FM 1938 was redesignated as <b>Urban</b> <b>Road</b> 1938 (UR 1938) by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). FM 1938 passes through central North Richland Hills and Southlake, providing access to several businesses.

40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright Elsevier [Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]Seat belt use on Spain's highways is more than 80 %, while on the <b>urban</b> <b>roads</b> this figure is around 50 %. As there was little information available to explain the difference in seat belt use rates, the main aim {{of this study was to}} investigate why there is a lower rate of seat belt use on <b>urban</b> <b>roads.</b> A number of perceptions, beliefs and expectancies about seat belt use were examined to identify variables that discriminated between seat belt users and non-users on <b>urban</b> <b>roads.</b> The subjects were 398 undergraduate students (aged 17 - 47) studying at the University of Girona, Spain. On the <b>urban</b> <b>roads</b> reported discomfort from using the seat belt was higher, while perceptions of risk (for non-users), safety perceptions (for those using a seat belt), beliefs about the seriousness of a crash or the effectiveness of the seat belt were all lower than on the highway. Perceptions of safety, discomfort, and social influence predicted seat belt use on <b>urban</b> <b>roads.</b> Concern about being lined for not using a seat belt did not predict seat belt use. The results of this research suggest that in order to increase seat belt use on <b>urban</b> <b>roads,</b> the issue of discomfort must be addressed. In addition, prevention campaigns should include information about the effectiveness of the seat belt in preventing/reducing injuries or deaths on <b>urban</b> <b>roads.</b> The results also highlight the importance of social influence for determining seat belt use/non-use and the potential role social influence could play in increasing seat belt usage...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this PhD thesis is the investigation of accident probability and severity exploiting high resolution traffic and weather data from <b>urban</b> <b>roads</b> and motorways, collected on a real-time basis, with specific focus on Powered-Two-Wheelers. For that purpose, an advanced mesoscopic multi-faceted statistical analysis was conducted in order to expand previous road safety work {{and contribute to the}} further understanding the complex issues of accident probability and severity. Linear models as well as non-linear models were developed on the basis of 6 -year accident data from <b>urban</b> <b>roads</b> as well as an urban motorway in Greater Athens area (Attica Tollway). Empirical findings indicate that high resolution traffic and weather data are capable of opening new dimensions in accident analysis in <b>urban</b> <b>roads</b> and <b>urban</b> motorways. The multi-faceted statistical analysis conducted in the thesis has revealed a consistent and strong influence of traffic parameters on accident probability and severity. It is interesting that weather parameters were not found to influence accident probability and severity when linear relationships are considered. Lastly, the application of cusp catastrophe models demonstrated that it is likely that even small traffic and weather changes may have a critical impact on <b>road</b> safety in <b>urban</b> <b>roads</b> as sudden transitions from safe to unsafe conditions (and vice versa) may occur...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{studies suggest}} that {{investments}} in <b>urban</b> <b>roads</b> have been justified in terms of easing congestion, saving time and energy, increasing safety, improving social and environmental outcomes and e nhancing economic development of a city.
