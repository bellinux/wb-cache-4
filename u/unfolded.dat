5|$|After {{a protein}} has been ubiquitinated, it is {{recognized}} by the 19S regulatory particle in an ATP-dependent binding step. The substrate protein must then enter {{the interior of the}} 20S particle to come in contact with the proteolytic active sites. Because the 20S particle's central channel is narrow and gated by the N-terminal tails of the α ring subunits, the substrates must be at least partially <b>unfolded</b> before they enter the core. The passage of the <b>unfolded</b> substrate into the core is called translocation and necessarily occurs after deubiquitination. However, the order in which substrates are deubiquitinated and <b>unfolded</b> is not yet clear. Which of these processes is the rate-limiting step in the overall proteolysis reaction depends on the specific substrate; for some proteins, the unfolding process is rate-limiting, while deubiquitination is the slowest step for other proteins. The extent to which substrates must be <b>unfolded</b> before translocation is not known, but substantial tertiary structure, and in particular nonlocal interactions such as disulfide bonds, are sufficient to inhibit degradation. The presence of intrinsically disordered protein segments of sufficient size, either at the protein terminus or internally, has also been proposed to facilitate efficient initiation of degradation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSingle-molecule force-clamp {{spectroscopy}} is {{a valuable}} tool to analyze <b>unfolding</b> kinetics of proteins. Previous force-clamp spectroscopy experiments have demonstrated that the mechanical <b>unfolding</b> of ubiquitin deviates from the generally assumed Markovian behavior and involves the features of glassy dynamics. Here we use single molecule force-clamp spectroscopy to study the <b>unfolding</b> kinetics of a computationally designed fast-folding mutant of the small protein GB 1, which shares a similar β-grasp fold as ubiquitin. By treating the mechanical <b>unfolding</b> of polyproteins as the superposition of multiple identical Poisson processes, we developed a simple stochastic analysis approach to analyze the dwell time distribution of individual <b>unfolding</b> events in polyprotein <b>unfolding</b> trajectories. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that the mechanical <b>unfolding</b> of NuG 2 fulfills all criteria of a memoryless Markovian process. This result, {{in contrast with the}} complex mechanical <b>unfolding</b> behaviors observed for ubiquitin, serves as a direct experimental demonstration of the Markovian behavior for the mechanical <b>unfolding</b> of a protein and reveals the complexity of the <b>unfolding</b> dynamics among structurally similar proteins. Furthermore, we extended our method into a robust and efficient pseudo-dwell-time analysis method, which allows one to make full use of all the <b>unfolding</b> events obtained in force-clamp experiments without categorizing the <b>unfolding</b> events. This method enabled us to measure the key parameters characterizing the mechanical <b>unfolding</b> energy landscape of NuG 2 with improved precision. We anticipate that the methods demonstrated here will find broad applications in single-molecule force-clamp spectroscopy studies {{for a wide range of}} proteins...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe 101 -residue monomeric protein S 6 <b>unfolds</b> in the anionic {{detergent}} {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) {{above the}} critical micelle concentration, with <b>unfolding</b> rates varying according to two different modes. Our group has proposed that spherical micelles lead to saturation kinetics in <b>unfolding</b> (mode 1), while cylindrical micelles prevalent at higher SDS concentrations induce a power-law dependent increase in the <b>unfolding</b> rate (mode 2). Here I investigate in more detail how micellar properties affect protein <b>unfolding.</b> High NaCl concentrations, which induce cylindrical micelles, favor mode 2. This is consistent with our model, though other effects such as electrostatic screening cannot be discounted. Furthermore, <b>unfolding</b> does not occur in mode 2 in the cationic detergent LTAB, which is unable to form cylindrical micelles. A strong retardation of <b>unfolding</b> occurs at higher LTAB concentrations, possibly due {{to the formation of}} dead-end protein-detergent complexes. A similar, albeit much weaker, effect is seen in SDS in the absence of salt. Chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 exhibits the same modes of <b>unfolding</b> in SDS as S 6, indicating that this type of protein <b>unfolding</b> is not specific for S 6. The <b>unfolding</b> process in mode 1 has an activation barrier similar in magnitude to that in water, while the activation barrier in mode 2 is strongly concentration-dependent. The strong pH-dependence of <b>unfolding</b> in SDS and LTAB suggests that the rate of <b>unfolding</b> in anionic detergent is modulated by repulsion between detergent headgroups and anionic side chains, while cationic side chains modulate <b>unfolding</b> rates in cationic detergents...|$|R
40|$|Pathways of <b>unfolding</b> {{a protein}} depend in {{principle}} on the perturbation—whether it is temperature, denaturant, or even forced extension. Widely-shared, helical-bundle spectrin repeats {{are known to}} melt at temperatures as low as 40 – 45 °C and are also known to <b>unfold</b> via multiple pathways as single molecules in atomic force microscopy. Given the varied roles of spectrin family proteins in cell deformability, we sought to determine the coupled effects of temperature on forced <b>unfolding.</b> Bimodal distributions of <b>unfolding</b> intervals are seen at all temperatures for the four-repeat β 1 – 4 spectrin—an α-actinin homolog. The major <b>unfolding</b> length corresponds to <b>unfolding</b> of a single repeat, and a minor peak at twice the length corresponds to tandem repeats. Increasing temperature shows fewer tandem events but {{has no effect on}} <b>unfolding</b> intervals. As T approaches Tm, however, mean <b>unfolding</b> forces in atomic force microscopy also decrease; and circular dichroism studies demonstrate a nearly proportional decrease of helical content in solution. The results imply a thermal softening of a helical linker between repeats which otherwise propagates a helix-to-coil transition to adjacent repeats.
