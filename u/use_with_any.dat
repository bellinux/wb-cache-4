Originally the company only published role-playing games such as the third edition of Talislanta and its own The Primal Order. The 1992 release of The Primal Order, a supplement designed for <b>use</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> game system, brought legal trouble with Palladium Books suing for references to Palladium's game and system. The suit was settled in 1993.|$|E

2500|$|The {{construction}} {{where an}} accusative noun or pronoun functions {{as the subject}} of an infinitive is called accusative and infinitive (See also the homonymous Latin construction accusativus cum infinitivo (ACI), which is the rule -in indirect speech- even in cases where verb and infinitive have co-referential subjects). This construction can be used as an indirect speech mechanism, in many instances interchangeable with a complementary declarative clause introduced by [...] "ὅτι/"ὡς" [...] (or a supplementary participle [...] ). But with some verbs (normally with verbs of thinking, as , , , [...] etc., with the verb [...] "say, affirm, assert" [...] , with verbs denoting hope, oath or promise, such as [...] "hope", [...] "swear", [...] "promise", etc.) the infinitival construction is the rule in classical Greek. Yet it can be also in <b>use</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> infinitival use, no matter whether indirect speech is involved or not. In the following examples the infinitival clause is put in square brackets : ...|$|E

2500|$|Though {{the full}} extent of the weapon's power is not explored, its area of effect is large enough that it is useful in space warfare and can also be {{contracted}} to an area small enough to take out a section of a man's stomach without causing collateral damage. However, it is also implied that this degree of accuracy is not something often achieved, and that the weapon is usually difficult to <b>use</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> degree of precision, to the extent of being dangerous to the users themselves. Users of hypometric weapons find that it is difficult to gauge their effectiveness in terms of [...] "range" [...] or [...] "accuracy", as these characteristics are subject to change. The weapon is apparently capable of affecting targets out of its line of sight, or even through solid walls, and has a volume of effect of up to several light-hours. The Inhibitors can eventually adapt to its effect, although the novel suggests this is a local response and not a galactic response (i.e., using the weapon in one solar system does not automatically generate the defenses in the next).|$|E
