5|$|Green Lantern Coaster {{begins with}} a <b>u-turn</b> out of the station. It ascends a chain lift hill before going down a small dip and into an s-bend {{followed}} by a <b>u-turn.</b> After a slight ascent, the car enters a 120.5° drop – the steepest in the southern hemisphere. The track then returns to approximately two thirds of its original height before entering {{the first set of}} block brakes. These brakes lead into a left turn with reverse or outward banking. It then drops under the block brakes and into the first inversion – a Dive Loop. The inversion begins with half of an inline twist which transitions into half of a vertical loop. Upon exiting the inversion the track inclines into a second set of block brakes. The train then goes around a right <b>u-turn</b> and into the second inversion – a downwards inline twist. This leads into a cutback-style turnaround before entering the final brake run and returning to the station.|$|E

40|$|Humanity is {{suffering}} from numerous natural, technological and health related hazards. Urban Road crash {{is one of the}} growing health issues these days in both developed and developing countries. Pakistan stands 1 st in Asia and 48 th in the world in this regard. Similarly, the metropolitan city of Pakistan, Karachi; ranks fourth in the list. Various reasons are responsible for these crashes in Karachi. Around 34 % of crashes in the city were accounted due to errors in road geometry. In this study use of high resolution satellite imagery made it possible for identifying geometrical errors at the <b>U-turns</b> on major arteries of the city. It was also recognized that most of the <b>U-turns</b> were built on the fastest lane of the roads with average distance of 1. 1 Km apart, are marked as vulnerable for considerable number of severe injury and fatal crashes. Moreover, inlet wall of all median <b>U-turns</b> were found broken, suggested that the car crash had occurred at least once. To cross check this observation, nearly 120 <b>U-turns</b> were surveyed and marked on the satellite imagery based on convenience. Trained professionals interviewed the people working/living nearby the <b>U-turns.</b> Out of 120 <b>U-turns</b> studied, 72. 5 % were without wall/median and 27. 5 % were with wall/median. Average number of people got injured or died due to crashes were statistically significant (p< 0. 05) between the above mentioned types of <b>U-turns.</b> In order to reduce geometrical errors use of RS (Remote Sensing) and GIS (Geographical Information System) techniques are strongly suggested to be incorporated while planning road design in the city. This would certainly save the resources particularly the lives of the people...|$|R

5|$|The Loop Parkway {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with Lido Boulevard {{on the eastern}} end of Long Beach Barrier Island in the neighborhood of Point Lookout. It proceeds north as a four-lane divided highway, crossing over Reynolds Channel to reach Alder Island, one of several islands comprising Jones Beach State Park. Here, the road slowly bends eastward as it runs across the marshy island. Two <b>U-turn</b> ramps are built into the median near the western end of the island, serving as the only intersections or interchanges of any kind on Alder Island. The Loop Parkway heads east from Alder Island, traversing Long Creek on a drawbridge leading to Meadow Island. The road quickly continues northeast across the island with no connections via interchanges or intersections.|$|E
5|$|At this crossing, US 22 heads {{north-northeast}} into Scotch Plains, Union County, {{coming to}} an interchange with CR 655. The route continues northeast as a four- to five-lane highway, passing near Bowcraft Amusement Park. The road continues east through Mountainside, turning northeast before entering Springfield, where it has an interchange with CR 509 Spur (signed as CR 577). Past this interchange, for 1.8 miles US 22 has an unusual wide median that contains commercial businesses and numerous <b>U-turn</b> ramps. In this area, the road comes to a level crossing with the abandoned Rahway Valley Railroad. It crosses the Rahway River into Union, where the wide median continues. The route briefly forms the northern border of Kenilworth before the median narrows back into a Jersey barrier. US 22 splits into two carriageways at the intersection with exits 140 and 140A of the Garden State Parkway and Route 82, site of the Union Watersphere.|$|E
5|$|Beyond this interchange, {{the route}} comes to two-way toll plaza {{and has a}} <b>U-turn</b> ramp from the {{southbound}} direction to the northbound direction intended to provide southbound motorists access to MD 695A. This ramp, known as MD 695C, also provides access to northbound I-695 from MD 695A by way of Authority Drive. After this, the route ascends onto the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which carries I-695 over the lower Baltimore Harbor and Patapsco River. Unlike the Fort McHenry or Harbor Tunnels, HAZMAT trucks are allowed to cross the Key Bridge. After crossing the Patapsco River over the bridge the route touches down within the Baltimore city limits and continues west past Thoms Cove through Hawkins Point's industrial areas. It comes to an interchange with Quarantine Road, which provides access to MD 173, south of Curtis Bay. By this point, the route’s signage changes from northsouth to eastwest.

5|$|The next {{interchange}} for the M-5 freeway {{connects to}} Grand River Avenue and 10 Mile Road. This {{section of the}} freeway bypasses residential areas of Farmington Hills. Further east, M-5 crosses into Farmington where it bypasses the downtown area of the suburb. Past 9Mile Road, the freeway ends at the intersection with Grand River Avenue, and M-5 follows Grand River southeasterly as a boulevard, a type of divided street. Traffic that wishes to make left turns must use a Michigan left maneuver along {{this section of the}} highway. Additionally, traffic that needs to change sides of the street must use crossovers in the median to perform a <b>U-turn.</b> Once again running through suburban Farmington Hills, the trunkline passes Botsford Hospital before intersecting 8Mile Road. This intersection marks the place where M-5 crosses into Wayne County, and the western terminus of the M-102 designation on 8Mile Road. Grand River Avenue runs through the northern section of Redford Township in Wayne County and crosses into Detroit at the intersection with 7Mile Road and 5Points Street.|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of turns during walking {{allows for the}} segmentation into straight and turn walking bouts. Several IMU-based methods were developed to this purpose, however {{many of them were}} tested on specific subject population. In this study, we tested four methods for the {{identification of}} turns in walking tasks with multiple <b>U-turns</b> that did not exploit any a-priori knowledge of the turn occurrences. We evaluated their robustness by recording IMU data on healthy and pathological subjects (healthy elderly, stroke survivors, patients with Parkinson disease and choreic patients) walking at two different speeds along a closed loop formed by straight bouts and <b>U-turns.</b> Overall, all methods identified correctly the totality of the <b>U-turns</b> when elderly and Parkinsonian patients were analyzed. When stroke survivors and choreic patients were analyzed, <b>U-turns</b> were either missed or erroneously detected in a limited number of cases. The only method using the magnetometer signals was the best performing, highlighting the usefulness of the magnetometer when turns are being investigated...|$|R

5|$|At an intersection, the {{incoming}} and outgoing lanes of traffic (including {{the ends of}} pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles) may be represented as the vertices of a graph, placed on the spine of a book embedding in their clockwise order around the junction. The paths through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an incoming lane to an outgoing lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph. For instance, this graph might have an edge from an incoming to an outgoing lane of traffic that both {{belong to the same}} segment of road, representing a <b>U-turn</b> from that segment back to that segment, only if U-turns are allowed at the junction. For a given subset of these edges, the subset represents a collection of paths that can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page of a book embedding. Thus, a book embedding of this graph describes a partition of the paths into non-interfering subsets, and the book thickness of this graph (with its fixed embedding on the spine) gives the minimum number of distinct phases needed for a signalling schedule that includes all possible traffic paths through the junction.|$|E
5|$|The missing {{connection}} between US 1 and MD 295 {{resulted in a}} circuitous path for traffic between I-95 and BWI Airport. In 1974, that route involved exiting I-95 at MD 100, which then served as a connector between the Interstate and US 1. Traffic took US 1 south to MD 176, then took MD 176 east to MD 295 and north to {{the western end of}} MD 46. Construction on the missing link, which by then was planned as part of I-195, began in 1987, when the highway's bridges over US 1 and I-895 were constructed. The remainder of the highway from MD 295 to the I-895 overpass was completed, including reconstruction of the interchange with MD 295, and the intermediate section opened in June 1990. The I-195 designation was applied to the highway's present length at the same time, and MD 166 was truncated to its present southern terminus. In 2002, as part of an expansion project at the airport, several new ramps were constructed to access parking lots and facilitate an easier <b>U-turn</b> for motorists leaving the terminal who wish to return to the terminal. In 2015, the eastern terminus of I-195 was cut back from the BWI Airport to the MD 170 interchange, with the section of road between those two points becoming MD 995A.|$|E
