40|$|International audienceDendritic {{growth in}} <b>undercooled</b> melts {{has been an}} {{interesting}} topic for metallurgists, physicists and mathematicians. In recent years, attention {{has been focused on}} the effects of melt flow on dendritic growth. Significant thermoelectric currents form in <b>undercooled</b> growth due to the presence of relatively large thermal gradients. Numerical simulations showed that the application of a static magnetic field exerts a complex influence on melt flow due to Lorentz force, damping and thermoelectrically driven convection, affecting growth kinetics in <b>undercooled</b> metallic melts. To verify the simulated results, bulk melts of high purity nickel were <b>undercooled</b> using the glass fluxing technique under static magnetic fields of up to 6 T. A high-speed camera was used for in situ monitoring of the recalescence process of the <b>undercooled</b> samples. The dendritic growth velocities at different melt undercoolings were calculated by simulating the recorded images of the recalescence process. The measured data confirms the predicted effect of heat and mass transport through thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics flow on dendritic growth...|$|R

50|$|Levitation {{techniques}} are useful tools in physics research. For example, levitation methods {{are useful for}} high-temperature melt property studies because they eliminate the problem of reaction with containers and allow deep <b>undercooling</b> of melts.

50|$|<b>Undercooling,</b> or supercooling, is {{the cooling}} of a liquid below its {{equilibrium}} freezing temperature while {{it remains a}} liquid.

40|$|It was {{suggested}} in 1952 by Frank that an icosahedral short-rangeorder(SRO) should be energetically favourable in <b>undercooled</b> melts of systems consisting of atoms with a sphere-like geometrical symmetry.

In this work the results of investigations of the SRO of deeply <b>undercooled</b> liquids of Co by energydispersive diffraction of synchrotron radiation are presented.

50|$|As {{solidification}} proceeds, {{an increasing}} number of atoms lose their kinetic energy, making the process exothermic. For a pure material, latent heat is released at the solid-liquid interface so that the temperature remains constant until the melt has completely solidified. The growth rate of the resultant crystalline substance will depend on how fast this latent heat can be conducted away. A dendrite growing in an undercooled melt can be approximated as a parabolic needle-like crystal that grows in a shape-preserving manner at constant velocity. Nucleation and growth determine the grain size in equiaxed solidification while the competition between adjacent dendrites decides the primary spacing in columnar growth. Generally, if the melt is cooled slowly, nucleation of new crystals will be less than at large <b>undercooling.</b> The dendritic growth will result in dendrites of a large size. Conversely, a rapid cooling cycle with a large <b>undercooling</b> will increase the number of nuclei and thus reduce the size of the resulting dendrites (and often lead to small grains).|$|E
50|$|However, greater <b>undercooling</b> by rapid {{quenching}} {{results in}} {{formation of martensite}} or bainite instead of pearlite. This is possible provided the cooling rate is such that the cooling curve intersects the martensite start temperature or the bainite start curve before intersecting the Ps curve. The martensite transformation being a diffusionless shear transformation is represented by a straight line to signify the martensite start temperature.|$|E
50|$|In {{a common}} {{refrigeration}} system, the refrigerant undergoes phase changes from {{gas to liquid}} and from liquid back to gas.

As there are little possibilities of completing this for {{the totality of the}} flowing refrigerant without <b>undercooling</b> or overheating, in conventional vapor-compression refrigeration both processes are unavoidable and always appear.|$|E

50|$|One {{method for}} {{controlling}} grain size in aluminum alloys is by introducing particles {{to serve as}} nucleants, such as Al-5%Ti. Grains will grow via heterogeneous nucleation; that is, for a given degree of <b>undercooling</b> beneath the melting temperature, aluminum particles in the melt will nucleate {{on the surface of}} the added particles. Grains will grow in the form of dendrites growing radially away from the surface of the nucleant. Solute particles can then be added (called grain refiners) which limit the growth of dendrites, leading to grain refinement. Al-Ti-B alloys are the most common grain refiner for Al alloys; however, novel refiners such as Al3Sc have been suggested.|$|E
50|$|The {{thickness}} of the ferritic plates is found to increase with the transformation temperature. Neural network models have indicated {{that this is not}} a direct effect of the temperature per se but rather a result of the temperature dependence of the driving force for the reaction and the strength of the austenite surrounding the plates. At higher temperatures, and hence lower <b>undercooling,</b> the reduced thermodynamic driving force causes a decrease in the nucleation rate which allows individual plates to grow larger before they physically impinge on each other. Further, the growth of the plates must be accommodated by plastic flow in the surrounding austenite which is difficult if the austenite is strong and resists the plate's growth.|$|E

When NaCl is added into a freeze-casting suspension, the solid ice phase and liquid regions are separated by a zone where both solids and liquids can coexist.

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{objective of}} this research is to increase the fundamental knowledge base for liquid- phase processing of technologically important oxide materials. The experimental objective is to define conditions and hardware requirements for microgravity flight experiments to test and expand the experimental hypotheses that: 1. Liquid phase transitions can occur in <b>undercooled</b> melts by a diffusionless process. 2. Onset of the liquid phase transition is accompanied by a large change in the temperature dependence of melt viscosity. Experiments on <b>undercooled</b> YAG (Y 3 A 15012) - and rare earth oxide aluminate composition liquids demonstrated a large departure from an Arrhenian temperature dependence of viscosity. Liquid YAG is nearly inviscid at its 2240 K melting point. Glass fibers were pulled from melts <b>undercooled</b> by ca. 600 K indicating that the viscosity is on the order of 100 Pans (1000 Poise) at 1600 K. This value of viscosity is 500 times greater than that obtained by extrapolation of data for temperatures above the melting point of YAG. These results show that the liquids are extremely fragile and that the onset of the highly non-Arrhenian viscosity-temperature relationship occurs at a temperature considerably below the equilibrium melting point of the solid phases. Further results on <b>undercooled</b> alumina-yttria melts containing 23 - 42 mole % yttrium oxide indicate that a congruent liquid-liquid phase transition occurs in the <b>undercooled</b> liquids. The rates of transition are inconsistent with a diffusion-limited process.

The specific heat capacities of this alloy in the <b>undercooled</b> liquid, the amorphous state and the crystal were determined. The differences in enthalpy, ∆H, entropy, ∆S, and Gibbs free energy, ∆G, between crystal and the <b>undercooled</b> liquid were calculated using the measured specific heat capacity data as well as the heat of fusion. The results indicate that the Gibbs free energy difference between metastable <b>undercooled</b> liquid and crystalline solid, ∆G, stays small compared to conventional metallic glass forming alloys even for large undercoolings. Furthermore, the Kauzmann temperature, TK, where the entropy of the <b>undercooled</b> liquid equals to that of the crystal, was determined to be 560 K. The Kauzmann temperature is compared with the experimentally observed rate-dependent glass transition temperature, Tg. Both onset and end temperatures of the glass transition depend linearly on the logarithm of the heating rate based on the DSC experiments. Those characteristic temperatures for the kinetically observed glass transition become equal close to the Kauzmann temperature in this alloy, which suggests an underlying thermodynamic glass transition as a lower bound for the kinetically observed freezing process...|$|R

50|$|Investigations {{show that}} in all cases gas {{atomisation}} of molten metal yields {{a broad range of}} droplet diameters, typically in the range 10-600 µm diameter, with a mean diameter of ~100 µm. Droplet diameter governs the dynamic behaviour of the droplet in flight which in turn determines the time available for in-flight cooling which is critical in controlling the resulting billet microstructure. At a flight distance of 300-400 mm, predictions show droplet velocities of 40-90 ms−1 for droplet diameters in the range 20-150 µm respectively, compared to measured velocities of ~100 ms−1, and at distances of up to 180 mm from the atomiser, droplets were still being accelerated by the gas. Droplets cool in-flight predominantly by convection and radiation, and can experience <b>undercooling</b> of up to 300 C prior to nucleation. Models and experimental measurements show that small droplets (<50 µm) very rapidly become fully solid prior to deposition, 50-200 µm droplets will be typically semi-solid and droplets of diameters >200 µm will be liquid at deposition. The range of droplet dynamic and thermal histories result in a billet top surface of 0.3 to 0.6 solid fraction. Not all material that impacts the surface is incorporated into the billet: some solid droplets will bounce or splash-off the billet top surface or be directed out of the deposition region by turbulent gas movement in the chamber. The proportion of droplets that impact the surface compared to the proportion that are incorporated into the billet has been termed the sticking efficiency: dependent on the geometric sticking which {{is a function of the}} spray angle relative to substrate and the thermal sticking efficiency dependent on spray and billet solid/liquid fraction.|$|E
