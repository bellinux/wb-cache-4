40|$|The {{incorporation}} of nanoclay in polyamide 6 (PA 6) {{may increase the}} strength and water resistance of hygroscopic PA 6. However impact strength of PA 6 was reduced upon the addition of nanoclay. Blends of polyamide 6 nanocomposites (PA 6 NC) with either <b>unmodified</b> <b>polyethylene</b> octene elastomer (POE) or reactive polyethylene octene elastomer grafted with maleic anhydride (POE-g-MA) were prepared to overcome the brittleness. The blends were prepared using co-rotating twin screw extruder followed by injection molding into tests samples. The {{results show that the}} impact strength of PA 6 NC containing POE-g-MA is significantly higher than samples containing POE. The plausible reason is that of the better compatibility between PA with POE-g-MA compared to POE with PA 6 due to formation of POE-g-PA 6 copolymer during the melt processing. POE-g-MA also caused in higher tensile strength values compared to when POE is used. The SEM study show that the rubbery disperse phase is smaller when POE-g-MA is used, making it more effective as impact modifier...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} structure–activity {{relationship}} in the antimicrobial activity of linear and branched poly(ethylene imine) s (L‐ and B‐PEIs) {{with a range of}} molecular weights (MWs) (500 – 12 [*] 000). Both L‐ and B‐PEIs displayed enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus over Escherichia coli. Both B‐ and L‐PEIs did not cause any significant permeabilization of E. coli cytoplasmic membrane. L‐PEIs induced depolarization of S. aureus membrane although B‐PEIs did not. The low MW B‐PEIs caused little or no hemolysis while L‐PEIs are hemolytic. The low MW B‐PEIs are less cytotoxic to human HEp‐ 2 cells than other PEIs. However, they induced significant cell viability reduction after 24 h incubation. The results presented here highlight the interplay between polymer size and structure on activity. <b>Unmodified</b> <b>poly(ethylene</b> imine) s are shown to act as selective antibacterial agents. The mechanism of action is likely related to, but not exclusive to, interaction with cell walls and cell membrane damage. These molecules provide a cost effective and chemically facile framework for the further development of selective antimicrobial materials...|$|E
40|$|Water-soluble guest-host {{complexes}} {{are prepared}} in a two-step process. For this a new, polydisperse ethylene glycol containing guest molecule is synthesized that is soluble in both chloroform and water. This guest {{is able to}} bind to urea-adamantyl-modified poly(propylene imine) dendrimers in chloroform in a noncovalent manner. When the chloroform is slowly evaporated and D 2 O is added, the hydrophobic dendrimer is solubilized in water. This is not possible when the hydrophobic dendrimer is directly added to the hydrophilic guests in water. When the <b>unmodified</b> <b>poly(ethylene</b> glycol) starting material is used, no solubilization occurs, and this indicates that the urea-acetic acid head group is necessary to solubilize the dendrimer. Approximately 26 guests are required for solubilization of the dendrimer. A lower number of guests results in aggregation and precipitation of the dendrimer. A monodisperse guest molecule {{has been used in}} NMR studies to show that the guest molecule binds with its acidic head group to the periphery of the dendrimer. This methodology opens the way to functional dendrimer aggregates in aqueous media...|$|E
40|$|Stiffness {{of asphalt}} mixture is a {{fundamental}} design parameter of flexible pavement. According to literature, stiffness value is very susceptible to environmental and loading conditions. In this paper, effects of applied stress and temperature on the stiffness modulus of <b>unmodified</b> and <b>Polyethylene</b> Terephthalate (PET) modified asphalt mixtures were evaluated using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). A quadratic model was successfully fitted to the experimental data. Based on the results achieved in this study, the temperature variation had the highest impact on the mixture's stiffness. Besides, PET content and amount of stress showed to have almost {{the same effect on}} the stiffness of mixtures. The optimal amount of PET was found to be 0. 41 % by weight of aggregate particles to reach the highest stiffness value. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Propionic acidemia (PA) is a {{metabolic}} disorder that causes mental retardation {{and that can}} be fatal if untreated. PA is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion involving mutations in PCCA or PCCB encoding the α and β subunits of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC). Current treatment is based on dietary restriction of substrate amino acids, which attenuates symptoms. However, patients still experience episodes of hyperammonemia that can cause progressive neurologic damage. In this paper, we have tested gene therapy approaches to PA in a stringent mouse model of PCCA deficiency, in which homozygous knockout mice are born but die within 36 [*]hr. In this work, we have delivered first-generation and helper-dependent adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad 5) vectors expressing the human PCCA cDNA by intraperitoneal injection into newborn mice. Unmodified Ad 5 vectors mediated extensive transduction of the peritoneum with weak liver transduction as determined by luciferase imaging and dsRed expression. In contrast, modification of Ad 5 with polyethylene glycol detargeted the virus from the peritoneum and retargeted it for transduction in the liver. When vectors expressing PCCA were injected, significant increases in life span were observed for both the <b>unmodified</b> and <b>polyethylene</b> glycol (PEG) -modified Ad 5 vectors. However, this rescue was transient. Similarly, adeno-associated virus serotype 8 -mediated transduction also produced only transient rescue. These data show first proof of principle for gene therapy of PA and demonstrate the potential utility of PEG to modify viral tropism in an actual gene therapy application...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{molecular}} {{weight on the}} dispersion of relatively polar montmorillonite (MMT) in non polar, <b>unmodified</b> high density <b>polyethylene</b> (HDPE) was examined. Polymer layered silicate (PLS) nanocomposites were compounded using three unmodified HDPE matrices of differing molecular weight and an organically modified MMT in concentrations ranging from 2 wt % to 8 wt % via single screw extrusion. The weight average molecular weights (WM) of the HDPE matrices {{used in this study}} ranged from 87, 000 g/mol to 460, 000 g/mol. X-ray diffraction (XRD), mechanical testing, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), as well as dynamic and capillary rheometry were performed on the nanocomposites. Nanocomposites generated from the high molecular weight (HMW) HDPE matrix exhibited increased intercalation of the MMT as shown by XRD as well as greater improvements in the Young’s modulus compared to nanocomposites generated from both the low (LMW) and middle molecular weight (MMW) matrices. This was attributed to higher shear stress imparted to MMT during compounding from the more viscous matrix facilitating their separation an...|$|R
40|$|Poly(oxyethylene) diamines were {{included}} in the copolymerization of ethylene glycol and dicarboxylic acids, such as terephthalic, adipic and sebacic acid, to produce a series of hydrophilic polyether-ester-amides. With the addition of poly(oxyethylene) diamines (average molecular weight of 2, 000) to PET in the amounts of 3. 2, 6. 6, 12 and 16 wt%, melting points of these polymers dropped accordingly, from 240 degrees C to around 227 degrees C, and the electronic resistivity decreased from 1 x 10 (13) to approximately 8 x 10 (8) ohm/sq. For comparison, the introduction of hydrophilic PEG- 2000 or a low molecular weight diamine, such as triethyleneglycol diamine, has less effect on electronic resistivity. Molecular weight. polymer rigidity and ageing are other factors affecting the surface resistivity. The degree of hydrophilicity was measured by the moisture absorption of the fibers made from these polyether-ester-amides. A weight gain of 0. 96 % was observed for 12 wt% Poly(oxyethylene) diamine modified polyether-ester-amides in comparison with 0. 40 % for the <b>unmodified</b> <b>poly(ethylene</b> terephthalate), These results are explained by a mechanism involving moisture absorption on the polymer surface through the formation of hydrogen bonding with amide and -(OCH 2 CH 2) -functionalities on the polymer surface...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{reports a}} rapid, simple and {{efficient}} one-step synthesis and detailed characterisation of stable aqueous colloids of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with <b>unmodified</b> <b>poly(ethylene)</b> glycol (PEG) molecules of different molecular weights and surface charges. By mixing and heating aqueous solutions of PEG with variable molecular chain and gold(III) chloride hydrate (HAuCl 4) {{in the presence}} of NaOH, we have successfully produced uniform colloidal 5 [*]nm PEG coated AuNPs of spherical shape with tunable surface charge and an average diameter of 30 [*]nm within a few minutes. It has been found out that PEGylated AuNPs provide optical enhancement of the characteristic vibrational bands of PEG molecules attached to the gold surface when they are excited with both visible (532 [*]nm) and NIR (785 [*]nm) laser lines. The surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signal does not depend on the length of the PEG molecular chain enveloping the AuNPs, and the stability of the colloid is not affected by the addition of concentrated salt solution (0. 1 [*]M NaCl), thus suggesting their potential use for in vitro and in vivo applications. Moreover, by gradually changing the chain length of the biopolymer, we were able to control nanoparticles’ surface charge from − 28 to − 2 [*]mV, without any modification of the Raman enhancement properties and of the colloidal stability...|$|E
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of cellulosic fibers into polyethylene matrices was studied in this work, by dispersion of fluff pulp from maritime pine {{in a hot}} polymer solution, followed by co-precipitation of the solid components by cooling at room temperature. The above method was found suitable for proper wetting and dispersion of fibers in the polymeric matrix, as compared with melt compounding. <b>Unmodified</b> low density <b>polyethylene</b> [LDPE], modified LDPE with maleic anhydride grafted {{linear low density polyethylene}} [M-LLDPE] and a copolymer of acrylic acid and n-butyl acrylate polyethylene [(AA/n-BA) -LDPE], were used as matrices for the preparation of fiber reinforced composites. The thermal properties of these composites were determined using differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The {{incorporation of}} cellulosic fibers results in a decrease of the crystallinity of the polymer matrix, as they act as inert material. In addition, the appropriate tests were run {{in order to determine the}} density and tensile properties of the composite specimens prepared by compression molding, with filler content ranging from 10 to 40 % (w/w). Composites based on modified LDPE showed improved mechanical properties. The Takaya-nagi model, applied to predict the Young's modulus of composites, was in very good agreement with the exper-imental data obtained in this work. © 2008 Society of Plastics Engineers...|$|R
40|$|Intravascular {{application}} of magnetic nanocarriers {{is a critical}} step {{in the development of}} new therapeutic strategies, including magnetic drug targeting or hyperthermia. However, injection of particulate matter bears the intrinsic risk of contact activation of the blood coagulation cascade. In this work, we use point-of-care assays to study coagulation dynamics and clotting parameters in blood samples exposed to relevant concentrations of surface-functionalized carbon-coated iron carbide nanomagnets using <b>unmodified</b> nanomagnets and <b>poly(ethylene)</b> glycol-functionalized nanomagnets with different end-groups, including –OCH 3, –NH 2, –COOH, –IgG, and –ProteinA-protected-IgG (–IgG-ProtA). Silica nanoparticles with a comparable surface area are used as a reference material. For magnetic nanoparticles, we observe a decrease in clotting time by 25 % compared to native blood at concentrations of 1 mg mL− 1, independent of the surface functionalization, and only minor differences in receptor expression on platelets (GP-IIb-IIIa, CD 62, and CD 63) relative to control samples were observed. Interestingly, the inter-subject variance of the clotting time is similar to the nanoparticle-induced effect in a single subject with average clotting time. Whilst the present study is based on in vitro assays and a small group of healthy blood donors, the comparison to broadly used silica nanoparticles, and the fact that experimental intergroup variability is comparable to the observed effects from the carbon-coated nanomagnets suggests continuing investigations on their potential clinical use...|$|R
