25|$|After the Second World War, the Soviet Union and the United States {{divided up}} the Korean Peninsula, {{formerly}} a Japanese colonial possession, along the 38th parallel, {{setting up a}} communist government {{in the north and}} a pro-Western government in the south. North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung visited Stalin in March 1949 and again in March 1950; he wanted to invade the south and although Stalin was initially reticent to provide support, he eventually agreed by May 1950. The North Korean Army launched the Korean War by invading the south in June 1950, making swift gains and capturing Seoul. Both Stalin and Mao believed that a swift victory would ensue. The <b>U.S.</b> <b>went</b> to the UN Security Council—which the Soviets were boycotting over its refusal to recognise Mao's government—and secured military support for the South Koreans. U.S. led forces pushed the North Koreans back. Stalin wanted to avoid direct Soviet conflict with the U.S., convincing the Chinese to hold the 38th Parallel.|$|E

Partington elaborated: [...] "We really wanted it to feel, not sad and somber really but just kind of have a broody feeling." [...] McMahon and Partington wrote songs separately. Partington had written six songs on the album before entering the studio. While touring Europe, the <b>US</b> <b>went</b> to war in Iraq.

500|$|In 1979, Sorkin {{attended}} Syracuse University. In {{his freshman}} year he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback {{because he wanted to}} be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that [...] "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason why a lot of <b>us</b> <b>went</b> to [...] 'You have the capacity to be so much better than you are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year.

500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind I would have made those saves.

It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The <b>U.S.</b> <b>went</b> on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the decade}} later {{featured}} {{a decline in}} output by neo soul artists, with many of them failing to make a commercial impact after previous successes or not releasing a follow-up album. Badu's commercial viability decreased as each of her releases following her debut Baduizm departed further from that album's music. Hill followed-up her 1998 debut, considered the best-selling neo soul album, with the 2002 live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, a combative, confessional work in which she expresses her misgivings about fame. Melena Ryzik of The New York Times wrote in a retrospect of that [...] "era of left-of-center black singer-songwriters", stating [...] "many of them struggled to keep their creative momentum, conflicted about their early mainstream success." [...] Producer and Soulquarians member Questlove elaborated on the artists' regression from the mainstream, saying [...] "I think most of <b>us</b> <b>went</b> through our psychosomatic, quasi-self-saboteur stage. Once we got that first taste of success, I think just the pressure of reacting got to all of us. Some of us released some of the craziest records of our career." [...] Other artists such as D'Angelo and Hill went on indefinite hiatus from the music scene. Tyler Lewis from PopMatters attributed the decline to [...] "the downside of [...] rejection of the term [...] ".|$|E
