40|$|We {{examine the}} {{evolution}} of the demand for skilled workers relative to unskilled workers in the Chilean manufacturing sector following Chile’s liberalization of trade in the late 1970 ’s. Following such trade reforms, the standard Heckscher-Olin model predicts that a low labor-cost country like Chile should experience an increased demand for low skilled workers relative to high skilled workers. Alternatively, if trade liberalization is associated with the adoption of new technologies, and technology is skill-biased, the relative demand for skilled workers may rise. Using a newly available plant-level data set that spans the sixteen year period 1979 - 1995, we find that the relative demand for skilled workers rose sharply during the 1979 - 1986 period and then stabilized. The sharp increase in demand for skilled workers coincided with an increased propensity to adopt new technologies as measured by <b>patent</b> <b>usage.</b> Plant-level analysis of labor demand confirms a significant relationship between the relative demand for skilled workers and technology adoption as measured by <b>patent</b> <b>usage</b> and other technology indicators. Our results suggest that skill-biased technological change is a significant determinant of labor demand and wage structures in developing economies. ...|$|R

Nations where information asymmetries between government officials and patentees {{are likely to be}} more prevalent-larger countries, wealthier economies, and those where international trade is more important-incorporate discretionary features into their patent systems more frequently. I also find evidence that policymakers are more likely to restrict patent office officials' flexibility and to divide the responsibility for determining patentability between the patent office and the courts when information problems are likely to be severe. ...|$|R
25|$|One {{effect of}} modern <b>patent</b> <b>usage</b> {{is that a}} small-time inventor, who can afford both the {{patenting}} process and {{the defense of the}} patent, can use the exclusive right status to become a licensor. This allows the inventor to accumulate capital from licensing the invention and may allow innovation to occur because he or she may choose not to manage a manufacturing buildup for the invention. Thus the inventor's time and energy can be spent on pure innovation, allowing others to concentrate on manufacturability.|$|R
40|$|Patents form {{a central}} pathway for {{capturing}} {{the value of}} intangible assets in a knowledge-intensive business. Patents can potentially generate and support earnings in two ways : they can be traded or licensed out, and they can provide critical protection for core production technologies or products {{that are to be}} traded. Recent patent valuation literature relates backward citations to the basicness of an innovation, and forward citation counts to the economic value of an innovation. In our data covering all Finnish biotechnology patents, we found indications of only the first relation. This might reflect either an excess of a technology-orientated attitude of the companies, or a well-argued value creation mechanism that remains hidden from our research methods. The results imply that a <b>usage</b> of <b>patent</b> citation measures might provide important measures for innovation policies, technology management, and valuation of knowledge-intensive industries. patents, patent citations, biotechnology...|$|R

40|$|Patents {{in general}} contain much novel {{technological}} information. This paper {{demonstrates that the}} <b>usage</b> of <b>patent</b> analysis can facilitate a unique scheme for tracking technology development. In this paper, the walking technique of the Japanese biped robot is tracked as an example. The searching method of the FI (file index) and F-term classification system developed by JPO (Japan Patent Office) was employed in this study, where all the related patent data were searched from the IPDL (Intellectual Property Digital Library). This study investigated an important technique applied to the humanoid biped robot that imitates the walking behavior of the human beings on two legs. By analyzing the patent information obtained, the relative research capabilities, technical strengths, and patent citation conditions among patent competitors were compared.

Those resources that constitute the foundation of such capacity is called renewal capital of a nation. Multiple indicators and measures of renewal capital of Mongolia were analyzed and reported here in this present paper. We found that: first, Mongolia needs more regular, large-scale data collection in regard to its national renewal capital, in order to know the directions of improvement and investment; second, while R&D spending and <b>patent</b> <b>usage</b> of businesses need to be stimulated more, scientific publication has potential to grow and contribute to renewal.

Our estimations show that the <b>usage</b> of both, <b>patents</b> and secrecy, hinders the innovation activities of firms through the reduction of spillovers.

40|$|Information, {{along with}} natural and {{economic}} resources, {{proves to be}} an unprecedented strategic tool in identifying new market opportunities and the prevention of potential threats to the enterprises. The importance of information is now universally accepted and is a resource whose management influences the success of organizations. Being knowledge the leverage to innovation and key to competitiveness, we analyze the role that information sources from industrial property play in this process and consequently on economic growth. This research attempts {{to answer the question}} about the relationship between the degree of knowledge and level of <b>usage</b> of <b>patent</b> information by research centres in Portugal and their contribution to the innovation process. The work’s hypothesis, that we tried to validate, is that university research centres that know and use patent information are more innovative since they contribute with more patents and they generate more new products and processes, giving birth to more spin-offs for its industrial application. Interview surveys were conducted to three industrial property support offices, one official agent of industrial property, two business incubators (Porto and Aveiro), one company, three librarians and five researchers to prepare adequately the questionnaire survey applied to 3. 819 researchers from 173 research centres of the public higher education (universities and polytechnics) from all scientific areas of Science, Technology and Medicine.

40|$|Strategic {{practitioners}} and business scholars continuously analyze and study competitive advantage through innovation, seeking measurements that {{provide evidence of}} cause and effect. As a policy matter and academic matter, the impact of intellectual property rights on innovation is still debated. Despite the argument from authority via some bureaus, institutions and vested interests, who do emphasize some empirical studies, the matter remains unsettled. This would appear perplexing considering the volumes of scholarship surrounding this topic. This dissertation encourages a stepping back and, via refreshed considerations of classical and contemporary international business literature, a baselining of the analysis. A means to balance the holistic with the detailed is necessary; innovation proxies, such as R&D spending or patent activity, are suspect given the fluid nature of innovation. Offering an enhancement to the value chain paradigm, a means to assess innovation as comparative advantage demands respect to the holistic activities of firms and country institutions. Property rights are often employed to show economic growth and innovation; however, property rights require parsing to determine if physical property rights alone are an impetus to innovation without reliance on intellectual property rights. The <b>usage</b> of <b>patent</b> as innovation proxy is challenged in this thesis. Thus, the argument is constructed by viewing multiple, theoretical drivers that effect the firm as well as country-specific institutions. The results indicate that patent protection is not correlated with macro-level views of innovation, {{and it is not}} an appropriate proxy for innovation unless confined in the narrowest of scenarios.

40|$|Information is an {{essential}} resource to the functioning and survival of organizations. In order for organizations {{to compete in a}} global environment, with rapid changes, where they move nowadays, they need to obtain information that’ll allow them to innovate and acquire competitive advantages in the markets they operate in. Scientific and technical information associated to Industrial Property – Patent Information - can provide further competitiveness through the transfer of technology that it motivates and is of vital economic importance due to the innovation that it stimulates. After analysing several Indicators, National and International Studies, we realized that Portugal is not using the resources of the Industrial Property’s records in a satisfactory way, not taking advantage of its benefits. The data published shows that university research centres are not living up to their full potential when it comes to using this type of information since it could, when due integrated into research projects, motivate innovation, provide competitive advantages, and increase the number of IP records. This could lead to an increase of the number of new companies and to economic growth. We support that a coherent and effective use of Patent Digital Libraries that contain information resulting from R&D activities with industrial applications can contribute to the increase of creativity and support problem- solving in research, developing innovation through the resulting new products and processes. This research attempts to answer the question about the relationship between the degree of knowledge and level of <b>usage</b> of <b>Patent</b> Digital Libraries by research centres in Portugal and their contribution to the innovation process.

40|$|How a firm {{utilizes}} {{technological innovation}} to improve operations management {{is an important}} research question in today's knowledge economy but lacks empirical evidence in the literature. We use a dataset of all non-service U. S. public firms from 1976 to 2005 to examine how a firm's innovation performance is associated with its inventory turnover performance. In particular, we measure a firm's innovation performance by the ratio of its patents (either citations or counts) to its research and development (R&D) expenditure. Our fixed-effect panel regression results indicate a positive relation between innovation performance and inventory turnover ratio, and such a relation varies across industries. By differentiating process and product innovation according to <b>patent</b> <b>usages,</b> we find that process innovation has a consistent and long-lasting effect, whereas product innovation has an immediate but short-lasting effect. We also find supporting evidence for industry spillovers by showing that firms in a more innovative industry are likely to better manage their inventory performance. Our results confirm the benefit of using innovation in logistics and operations management and point to the strategic importance of integrating technology and operations management. postprin...|$|R
40|$|In North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), {{information}} on industrial property rights is made available at four patent information centres. Three {{of these are}} located at universities (Aachen, Dortmund and Krefeld), while the fourth (the Bielefeld patent information centre) is run as an Eingetragener Verein (registered association) {{by a number of}} partners (among them the Bielefeld Chamber of Industry and Commerce). The three patent information centres in Aachen, Dortmund and Bielefeld are receiving financial support from the NRW Economics Ministry as part of a project running from 1995 to 1999. The aim is to achieve a substantial improvement in the range of services offered by the centres. Apart from ensuring high performance in the areas of document supply and search on demand, a primary objective is to enhance the technical infrastructure. One of the early results has been the building up of local area networks allowing for efficient, user-friendly access to CD-ROMs to help the public conduct their own searches.

A further project starting in the year 2000 is to focus on maintaining the level that has been attained and on adapting the structures to match new developments in the field of national and international networks. ...|$|R
40|$|Design patents {{have been}} part of American law since 1842. In that time, only just over 600, 000 design patents have been issued, with more than half of these being granted in the last twenty years. This {{quantity}} is dramatically fewer than the number of utility patents issued which is rapidly approaching 9, 000, 000 issued patents. Possibly because of the low <b>usage</b> of design <b>patents</b> over time, no case law and little literature address the constitutional issues raised by them. This article intends to overcome that shortcoming. Two constitutional aspects of design patents will be examined. First, congressional authority to adopt the design patent laws will be examined. The Constitution in Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 grants Congress specific powers to adopt both patents and copyrights. When a design is examined, it is unclear that it is an invention making its patentability suspect. At the same time, establishing a design as a writing is not problematic, leading to its eligibility for copyright. In this case, the clause itself must be examined to determine if something that qualifies only for copyright protection can nevertheless be granted a patent. The words chosen in the clause, particularly based on the way some of them were used in the Eighteenth Century, suggest that the answer is “no. ” Of course, any historical analysis of the Constitution may prove to be an inaccurate predictor of how modern courts would address an issue, but this analysis does suggest a significant Article I problem for design patents. Second, even if the Article I problem can be overcome, serious First Amendment issues are raised. Unlike a utility patent, design patents {{are far more likely to}} have direct impacts on speech. If so, the patent laws would have to accommodate that speech unless there is a compelling governmental need for it to not do so. Copyright law, for example, avoids much of this First Amendment conflict through the recognition of the Fair Use Defense under 17 U. S. C. § 107 which allow society to use copyrighted materials despite the legal protection where important First Amendment issues are raised. Patent law has no such defense, but may need one to avoid constitutional problems...|$|R
