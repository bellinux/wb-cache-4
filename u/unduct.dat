40|$|The primary {{objective}} was {{the development of}} a time dependent 3 -D Euler/Navier-Stokes aerodynamic analysis to predict unsteady compressible transonic flows about ducted and <b>unducted</b> propfan propulsion systems at angle of attack.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} unsteady aerodynamic {{analysis is}} described for predicting the time-dependent flow about ducted and <b>unducted</b> propfans operating at angle of attack. Although the freestream {{is assumed to}} be uniform, the flow relative to the rotating blades varies with circumferential position, resulting in an inherent unsteadiness due to the nonaxial inflow. The time-dependent Euler equations are solved utilizing a Runge-Kutta time-stepping scheme. The analysis is based on a finite-volume discretization employing a multiple-block grid network. To permit the use of large calculation time steps, an implicit residual smoothing scheme previously tested for unsteady flow calculations in two dimensions is extended to three spatial dimensions. For <b>unducted</b> propfans, a single H-type grid block is used for each blade passage to determine the time-periodic flowfield. For ducted propfans (ultra-high bypass fans) a body-centered C-type grid is wrapped about the cowl to improve the accuracy of the analysis in the high gradient flow region near the cowl leading edge.

40|$|Predictions of the {{prevalence}} of annoyance associated with aircraft noise exposure are heavily influenced by field studies conducted in urban airport neighborhoods. Flyovers heard in such relatively high ambient noise environments are composed in large part of high absolute level, broadband noise.

The annoyance of noise intrusions of low absolute level {{has been shown to be}} closely related to their audibility. Thus, one way to predict the annoyance of en route noise generated by <b>unducted</b> fan engines is to estimate its audibility relative to that of conventionally powered aircraft in different ambient noise environments.

40|$|The {{greening}} {{of transport}} has been highlighted in the Paris Agreement {{in order to}} participate to a durable development of our society. One of the main ways to fulfil environmental requirements is to reduce of the total energy consumption throughout the whole life of vehicles: that is during their manufacturing, during their utilisation, and during their end-of-life management. A new generation of engines named counter-rotating open rotor (CROR) {{is one of the}} technical candidates that are currently investigated, since they could lead to a significant reduction of the energy consumption of civil aircrafts. With the exception of two rows of larger <b>unducted</b> blades, the components of CROR-engines {{are similar to those of}} conventional engines. Aircraft configurations with CROR-engines are extremely challenging, since the <b>unducted</b> blades can be hit by foreign objects (hail, debris) or wild life (large bird) at high impact velocities. A further threat is the release of a large <b>unducted</b> blade that could impact the aircraft primary structures like the fuselage, the wings, or the vertical tail. The Institute of Structures and Design of the German Aerospace Centre is therefore contributing to the development of a validated simulation methodology to assess the behaviour of a fuselage under the impact of a composite CROR-blade. In order to investigate this topic, different tasks were successfully performed: determination of a low readiness level high velocity impact test matrix, manufacturing of coupons, quasi-static material characterisation, material card developments, connection of different commercial software to build a simulation process chain (from computer assisted design over pre-processing up to numerical simulations and analysis of results), validation of selected low readiness level impact test simulations, and utilisation of the tool chain to demonstrate the feasibility of damage assessment in composite structures after high velocity impact.
