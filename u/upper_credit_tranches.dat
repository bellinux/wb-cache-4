In the last decade, financial facilities encompassed by high-conditionality have assumed the greatest importance. They may be obtained after submitting a programme of structural adjustments aiming at elimination of deficit {{in the balance of}} payments, obtaining acceptance ol such a programme by the IMF, and making a commitment by an interested country to implement this programme. In this connection, the authoress has found it advisable to discuss stand-by arrangements, which have become the main instrument of the principle of conditionality of the IMF assistance and programmes of structural changes before proceeding to the review of high-conditionality mechanisms such as: <b>upper</b> <b>credit</b> <b>tranches,</b> extended facilities, policy of enlarged access, and structural adjustment facilities.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} factors that have {{influenced}} countries'' participation in IMF drawing programs. IMF drawing programs are defined as the period of a Stand-By Arrangement or an Extended Fund Facilities program during which a country borrows from the Fund. Since this definition excludes precautionary arrangements and periods during which the program went off-track, it provides a closer link to {{the factors that}} have influenced the evolution of IMF credit outstanding. The analysis uses quarterly data during the period 1982 - 2005 and focuses on developing, non-PRGF eligible countries. Country-specific variables-net international reserves and GDP growth-together with a global factor-world GDP growth-are found {{to be among the}} most significant determinants of countries'' participation in IMF drawing programs. The importance of the global factor is not uniform during the period reviewed. The influence of world GDP growth seems to have been significant during the 1980 s debt crises but not since the Mexican crisis in 1994. An out-of-sample forecast evaluation of the period 2004 - 5 reveals that the model has some predictive power.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to quantify the relationship between the global economic environment and the number of Stand-By Arrangements (SBAs). The results suggest that oil prices, world interest rates, and the global business cycle are the most influential indicators that affect the number of SBAs being requested. In addition, the empirical model seems to have reasonable accuracy when predicting SBAs. Furthermore, when oil prices, interest rates, and the global business cycle are adversely shocked by one standard deviation, the conditional probability of a SBA nearly doubles, implying an increase from about six to 12 SBAs. More critically, the model suggests that even a steady deterioration of the global economic climate would imply increasingly harsher conditions for developing and emerging market countries which may in turn significantly increase the demand for IMF resources.

The concept revolves around {{the idea that the}} propensity of investors to lend to a country increases when the IMF provides its "seal of approval"-backed up by only limited official financing-on the country''s economic program. COF aims at avoiding, on the one hand, the massive use of public money to bail out private investors; on the other, the recourse to coercive bailing-in mechanisms.

He proposed a test of conditional independence of the variables forming the rows and columns of the tables, conditional on the levels of a third variable. Results of graduates from ten randomly selected departments from the federal Polytechnic, Ado-Ekiti were examined in this research. Students final grade are categorised in to two: (i) Low Grade (Pass and Lower Credit) and (ii) High Grade (<b>Upper</b> <b>Credit</b> and Distinction). This is combined with sex (male and female) to form 2 x 2 x h contingency table. Breslow-Day and Tarone’s statistics show that the null hypothesis of homogeneity of odds ratio across the departments is not rejected implying that the odds ratio across the ten departments is not significantly different. Cochran’s and MantelHaenszel statistics reveals the final grade of students (Low or High) is not associated with sex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} Nigeria’s Request for a Two-Year Policy Support Instrument {{to support}} its reform efforts. All three tiers of government have adhered to a conservative oil price-based fiscal rule, resulting in large overall budget surpluses and a significant buildup of international reserves. The authorities have also initiated a broad structural reform program. GDP growth has been robust, benefiting from the improved macroeconomic environment and policy initiatives to spur agricultural production; and the medium-term growth outlook is favorable.

40|$|The {{market for}} <b>tranched</b> <b>credit</b> {{products}} (CDOs, Itraxx tranches) {{is one of}} the fastest growing segments in the credit derivatives industry. However, some assumptions underlying the standard Gaussian onefactor pricing model (homogeneity, single factor, Normality), which is the pricing standard widely used in the industry, are probably too restrictive. In this paper we generalize the standard model by means of a two by two model (two factors and two asset classes). We assume two driving factors (business cycle and industry) with independent tStudent distributions, respectively, and we allow the model to distinguish among portfolio assets classes. In order to illustrate the estimation of the parameters of the model, an empirical application with Moody's data is also included. ...|$|R
40|$|Credit default swaps (CDSs) are {{derivative}} {{contracts that}} allow agents {{to shift the}} risk of default on an underlying credit from a credit protection buyer to a credit protection seller. Like other derivatives they are standardised relative to the underlying cash markets {{and in this way}} can help promote market liquidity. This in turn can facilitate risk shifting and price discovery. In this way they may lead to accurate pricing of credit risk and ultimately to the reduced costs of borrowing. However, like other derivatives it is possible that CDS contracts could play a part in market manipulations, especially when the underlying cash market is not transparent. This is a potential cost of CDS trading that should be weighed against potential benefi ts of liquidity, risk shifting and price discovery. We discuss the balance of these trade-offs in the context of singlename corporate CDSs, index CDSs, sovereign CDSs and CDSs on structured <b>credit</b> product <b>tranches.</b> We also discuss other potential costs of CDS trading including that they “make selling short too cheap ” and that they may create market instability by facilitating speculative attacks...|$|R
5000|$|Legally, a CMO is a debt {{security}} issued by an abstraction—a special purpose entity—and {{is not a}} debt owed by the institution creating and operating the entity. The entity is the legal owner {{of a set of}} mortgages, called a pool. Investors in a CMO buy bonds issued by the entity, and they receive payments from the income generated by the mortgages according to a defined set of rules. With regard to terminology, the mortgages themselves are termed collateral, ''''classes'''' refers to groups of mortgages issued to borrowers of roughly similar <b>credit</b> worthiness, <b>tranches</b> are specified fractions or slices, metaphorically speaking, of a pool of mortgages and the income they produce that are combined into an individual security, while the structure is the set of rules that dictates how the income received from the collateral will be distributed. The legal entity, collateral, and structure are collectively referred to as the deal. Unlike traditional mortgage pass-through securities, CMOs feature different payment streams and risks, depending on investor preferences. [...] For tax purposes, CMOs are generally structured as Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits, which avoid the potential for [...] "double-taxation".|$|R
40|$|Did the World Bank's policy-based {{lending to}} Kenya in the 1980 s allow Kenya to {{undertake}} adjustment, or to postpone it? The answer is mixed, says the author. Success was greatest in trade liberalization (and exchange rate depreciation), {{and to a}} lesser extent in export development [...] and these reforms would probably not have occurred without steady Bank lending. But one could argue that budget support through funds from the International Development Association may have helped Kenya postpone critical public sector reform [...] in the civil service and social sectors and in divestiture of parastatals (including the National Cereals and Produce Board). Was aid to Kenya (including the Bank's) overgenerous? The author concludes that, based on reform behavior and performance, Kenya may deserve less aid than Ghana (Africa's best performer) but it does not exhibit the same aid dependency as other donor favorites in the region. But its public investment program did a poor job in ranking priorities, and growing reliance on grants and counterpart funds undoubtedly contributed to more consumption spending by government, particularly on the civil service and parastatals. Implementation of structural adjustments in Kenya was often lethargic and sometimes even contrary to stated policies, says the author. And despite a fairly stable political climate, commitment to the adjustment program was patchy and intermittent. Reforms ostensibly undertaken were in fact not always implemented. In principle, for example, an auction market for government paper was created, but in practice financial institutions typically undertook up most of that paper"by arrangement. "And restrictions on movement of maize were removed but reimposed. Moreover, the design of the structural adjustment loans appears, in retrospect, to have been faulty. Too many conditions [...] too general, and based on dated sectoral information [...] were attached to each loan, in part because of political considerations. And the Bank released <b>credit</b> <b>tranches</b> when conditions were met in letter but not in spirit. The adjustment program benefited in the second half of the 1980 s from lessons learned in the first half of the decade, particularly concerning trade liberalization and export development. But the design and dimensions of reform in the agricultural sector were too limited to achieve significant restructuring of the sector, and political interests effectively sabotaged the program. The second attempt at adjustment was also undermined by increasing financial laxity. The experience in Kenya underlines the difficulty of implementing structural adjustment under either financial laxity or extreme financial stringency. Note, too, that many things have changed in Kenya since this study was completed in the early 1990 s.
