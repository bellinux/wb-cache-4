5|$|Berger {{was acquitted}} under counts one, and two, and {{some parts of}} counts three, and five, and was also acquitted under count six.

He was also convicted <b>under</b> <b>that</b> part of count seven relating to the children and youth slave labour program, including the Heuaktion, and was also convicted under count eight. Judge Powers handed down a dissenting opinion, stating that he was of the view that Berger was not responsible for the murder of Mesny.|$|E

40|$|A three-year {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the effect of sprinkler irrigation on winter wheat growth in North China Plain. The surface irrigation was arranged as control. The research results indicate that: (1) amplitude of soil moisture during irrigation intervals under sprinkler irrigation condition was lower than <b>that</b> <b>under</b> surface irrigation condition; (2) {{the maximum number of}} tillers under sprinkler irrigation condition was smaller than <b>that</b> <b>under</b> surface irrigation condition, however, there was no great difference between the numbers of spikes under both conditions, i. e. the sterile number of tillers under sprinkler irrigation field was smaller than <b>that</b> <b>under</b> surface irrigation condition; (3) winter wheat height under sprinkler irrigation condition was higher than <b>that</b> <b>under</b> surface irrigation condition during elongation stage while {{there was no significant difference}} between the two conditions at harvest days; (4) leaf area index(LAI) at earlier stage under sprinkler irrigation condition was smaller or approximates <b>that</b> <b>under</b> surface irrigation condition, the maximum LAI was smaller than <b>that</b> <b>under</b> surface irrigation condition, and LAI gradually increased and became larger than <b>that</b> <b>under</b> surface irrigation condition after perk point; (5) significant difference of biomass of single stem between both irrigation methods was not found before grain filling, and then it increased and became more than <b>that</b> <b>under</b> surface irrigation condition; the total biomass under sprinkle irrigation condition was smaller than <b>that</b> <b>under</b> surface irrigation condition during elongation stage, and then it increased quickly and became higher than <b>that</b> <b>under</b> surface irrigation field; and(6) winter wheat yields under sprinkler irrigation condition were higher than <b>that</b> <b>under</b> surface irrigation condition...|$|R

30|$|It is {{observed}} from Fig.  3 a <b>that</b> <b>under</b> the condition <b>that</b> the mass content of non-condensing gases is kept unchanged, SMTF pressure decreases with increasing of injection rate. It {{is observed}} from Fig.  3 b <b>that</b> <b>under</b> the condition <b>that</b> the mass content of non-condensing gases is kept unchanged, SMTF temperature increases {{at first and}} then turns to decrease with increasing of injection rate. This is because when the injection rate is relatively small, heat loss has a significant influence on temperature drop. However, the effect of heat loss on temperature drop becomes weaker with increasing of injection rate. It is observed from Fig.  3 c <b>that</b> <b>under</b> the condition <b>that</b> the mass content of non-condensing gases is kept unchanged, superheat degree increases with increasing of injection rate. Besides, <b>under</b> the condition <b>that</b> the injection rate is kept unchanged, superheat degree decreases with increasing of mass content of non-condensing gases. It is observed from Fig.  3 d that the effect of injection rate on enthalpy profiles is negligible, but the enthalpy decreases rapidly with increasing of mass content of non-condensing gases.|$|R

5|$|At the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, the Soviet {{team won}} all seven of its games, earning the gold medal. Canada {{finished}} the tournament with five wins and two losses, putting {{the team in}} a three-way tie for second place with Sweden and Czechoslovakia. Before 1964, the tie-breaking procedure was based on goal difference in games against teams in the medal round; <b>under</b> <b>that</b> system, Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechoslovakian team. During the tournament the procedure was changed to take all games into consideration, which meant that the Canadians finished fourth. At the time, the Olympics counted as the World Championships; under their (unchanged) rules, Canada should have received bronze for the World Championships.|$|E

The ship put into the Todd Hoboken Shipyard at the Port of New York for conversion, remaining there until completion on 30 June 1944. The ship was initially assigned the name Poppy, under the then-current policy of naming Army hospital ships after flowers, but never operated <b>under</b> <b>that</b> name. The ship was instead named after First Lieutenant Blanche F. Sigman, a U.S. Army nurse killed in action on 7 February 1944 on the beachhead during Operation Shingle, the Allied landings at Anzio.|$|E
