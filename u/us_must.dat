5|$|Blonde on Blonde is {{the seventh}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, {{released}} on May 16, 1966, on Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, {{including members of}} Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album—"One of <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{airports}} {{are required to}} obtain stormwater discharge permits and ensure that wastes from deicing operations are properly collected and treated. Large new airports {{may be required to}} collect 60 percent of aircraft deicing fluid after deicing. Airports that discharge the collected aircraft deicing fluid directly to waters of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>must</b> also meet numeric discharge requirements for chemical oxygen demand. A report in 2000 stated that ethylene glycol was becoming less popular for aircraft deicing in the U.S., due to its reporting requirements and adverse environmental impacts (p.213), and noted a shift to the use of propylene glycol (p.I-3).|$|E

25|$|Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has {{invented the}} Esperanto language. It {{has all the}} {{potential}} qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of <b>us</b> <b>must</b> be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice {{on the part of}} its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of <b>us</b> <b>must</b> study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and {{become a part of the}} curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Dylan became disillusioned {{about using}} the Hawks in the studio. He {{recorded}} more material at Studio A on January 25, backed by drummer Bobby Gregg, bassist Rick Danko (or Bill Lee), guitarist Robbie Robertson, pianist Paul Griffin, and organist Al Kooper. Two more new compositions were attempted: [...] "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat" [...] and [...] "One of <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)". Dylan was satisfied with [...] "One of <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know"; the January 25 take was released as a single {{a few weeks later}} and was subsequently selected for the album.|$|E
500|$|... "One of <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know" [...] is a {{straightforward}} {{account of a}} burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover. As he presents his case in the opening verse, it appears he is incapable of either acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse: [...] "I didn't mean to treat you so bad. You don't {{have to take it}} so personal. I didn't mean to make you so sad. You just happened to be there, that's all." [...] "One of <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know" [...] was the first recording completed for Blonde on Blonde and the only one selected from the New York sessions. The song was released as the first single from the album on February 14, the same day Dylan began to record in Nashville. It failed to appear on the American charts, but reached number 33 in the UK.|$|E

500|$|The New York {{sessions}} comprise: two takes of [...] "Medicine Sunday", one take of [...] "Jet Pilot", twelve takes of [...] "Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?", seven takes of [...] "I Wanna Be Your Lover", fourteen takes of [...] "Visions of Johanna", sixteen takes of [...] "She's Your Lover Now", four takes of [...] "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat", twenty-four takes of [...] "One of <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)", one take of [...] "I'll Keep It with Mine", and one take of [...] "Lunatic Princess".|$|E
500|$|Another session {{took place}} on January 27, this time with Robertson, Danko, Kooper and Gregg. Dylan and his band {{recorded}} [...] "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat" [...] and [...] "One of <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)" [...] again, but Dylan was {{not satisfied with the}} recorded performance of either song. Also at this session Dylan attempted a rough performance of [...] "I'll Keep It with Mine", a song which he had already recorded twice as a demo. The musicians added some tentative backing in a rendering biographer Clinton Heylin described as [...] "cursory". The recording was ultimately released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 in 1991.|$|E
500|$|Despite Eisenhower's {{interest}} in a deal, his administration was hamstrung by discord among US scientists, technicians, and politicians. At one point, Eisenhower complained that [...] "statecraft was becoming a prisoner of scientists." [...] Until 1957, Strauss's AEC (including its Los Alamos and Livermore laboratories) was the dominant voice in the administration on nuclear affairs, with Teller's concerns over detection mechanisms also influencing Eisenhower. Unlike some others within the US scientific community, Strauss fervently advocated against a test ban, arguing that the <b>US</b> <b>must</b> maintain a clear nuclear advantage via regular testing and that the negative environmental impacts of such tests were overstated. Furthermore, Strauss repeatedly emphasized {{the risk of the}} Soviet Union violating a ban, a fear Eisenhower shared.|$|E

500|$|Although The Basement Tapes {{reached the}} public in an unorthodox manner, officially {{released}} eight years after the songs were recorded, critics have assigned them an important place in Dylan's development. Michael Gray writes, [...] "The core Dylan songs from these sessions actually do form a clear link between ... two utterly different albums. They evince the same highly serious, precarious quest for a personal and universal salvation which marked out the John Wesley Harding collection—yet they are soaked in the same blocked confusion and turmoil as Blonde on Blonde. 'Tears of Rage', for example, is an exact halfway house between, say, 'One of <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)' and 'I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine'".|$|E
500|$|Polizzotti, in {{his study}} of Highway 61 Revisited, writes that the opening track of Side Two, [...] "Queen Jane Approximately" [...] is in a similar vein to [...] "Like a Rolling Stone", but the song offers [...] "a touch of sympathy and even comfort in place of {{relentless}} mockery". The song is structured as a series of ABAB quatrain verses, with each verse followed by a chorus that is simply a repeat of the last line of each verse: [...] "Won't you come see me Queen Jane?". Gill calls this song [...] "the least interesting track" [...] on Highway 61, but praises the piano ascending the scale during the harmonica break as an evocation of [...] "the stifling nature of an upper class existence". Others have speculated that the song is directed at Joan Baez and the folk movement, which Dylan had largely left behind. [...] "Queen Jane Approximately" [...] was released as the B-side of Dylan's [...] "One of <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)" [...] single in early 1966.|$|E
500|$|The {{final year}} of the war—1918—started with {{disaster}} and ended in triumph. On 21 March 1918, General Erich Ludendorff, Chief of the German General Staff, launched the Spring Offensive, which was intended to defeat the Allies on the Western Front before {{the strength of the}} American Expeditionary Force (AEF) could become overwhelming. The main weight of the first blow—Operation Michael—fell on General Gough' s Fifth Army which was forced to retreat. In response to the crisis facing the Allies, French Generalissimo Ferdinand Foch was made Supreme Commander of the Allied forces on the Western Front, placing the BEF under his strategic direction. The next German attack came south of Ypres in the Battle of the Lys river and here too the BEF fell back. Field Marshal Haig issued his famous Order of the Day, [...] "With our backs to the wall and believing in the justice of our cause, each one of <b>us</b> <b>must</b> fight on to the end." [...] A third major German offensive, falling mainly on the French, was finally halted on the Marne in June. On 8 August, General Rawlinson's Fourth Army launched the Battle of Amiens which marked the start of the Hundred Days Offensive, the final Allied offensive on the Western Front. Over the following weeks, all five armies of the BEF went on the offensive from the Somme to Flanders. Fighting continued right up until the Armistice with Germany came into effect at 11:00 am on 11 November 1918.|$|E

2500|$|During WW I, the {{expression}} to fight [...] "with one's {{back to the}} wall" [...] became a widely-known way to refer to making a last stand.

2500|$|During {{and between}} tours, Dylan and the Hawks {{attempted}} several recording sessions, but {{with less than}} satisfying results. Sessions in October and November yielded just one usable single ("Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window"), and two days of recording in January 1966 for what {{was intended to be}} Dylan's next album, Blonde on Blonde, resulted in [...] "One of <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)", which was released as a single a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album. On [...] "One of <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know", Dylan was backed by drummer Bobby Gregg, bassist Danko (or Bill Lee), guitarist Robbie Robertson, pianist Paul Griffin, and Al Kooper (who was more a guitarist than an organist) playing organ. Frustrated by the slow progress in the New York studio, Dylan accepted the suggestion of producer Bob Johnston and moved the recording sessions to Nashville. In Nashville, Robertson's guitar was prominent on the Blonde on Blonde recordings, especially [...] "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat", but {{the other members of the}} Hawks did not attend the sessions.|$|E
