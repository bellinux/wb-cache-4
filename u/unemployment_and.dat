40|$|In many OECD countries, e. g. in Germany, France, or the UK, {{unemployment}} compensation {{consists of}} <b>unemployment</b> insurance <b>and</b> <b>unemployment</b> assis-tance.

The e«ects of this two-tier unemployment compensation system are studied in a general equi-librium job search model with endogenous distributions of income, wealth, and employment which is calibrated {{with regard to the}} characteristics of the German economy. Our results are as follows: i) employment is a decreas-ing function of both <b>unemployment</b> insurance <b>and</b> <b>unemployment</b> assistance. ii) Savings are (not) a monotone increasing function of unemployment in-surance (unemployment assistance payments). iii) Optimal unemployment compensation payments are found to be a decreasing function over time. ...|$|R
40|$|Inflation <b>and</b> <b>unemployment</b> {{are perhaps}} the two most {{important}} challenges that face the South African economy of today.

The model regresses the monetary policy variable against inflation <b>and</b> <b>unemployment</b> growth over the period 1980 - 2008. The results suggest that (1) there is a long run relationship between inflation <b>and</b> <b>unemployment</b> (2) monetary policy reacts more to variations in inflation compared to variations in unemployment. Secondly, the relationship between inflation <b>and</b> <b>unemployment</b> as explained by the Phillips curve is investigated.

5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high <b>unemployment</b> <b>and</b> underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E

Recessions after World War II may be compared to each other much more easily than previous recessions because of these available data. The listed dates and durations are from the official chronology of the National Bureau of Economic Research. GDP data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, unemployment from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (after 1948). Note that the unemployment rate often reaches a peak associated with a recession after the recession has officially ended.|$|E
