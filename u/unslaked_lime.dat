6000|$|Never {{before had}} I tasted so delicious a draught. Hours {{of anxiety and}} effort under a blazing sun had parched and fouled my lips, and my throat was dry as <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime.</b> The tin vessel was empty when I handed it back, and the {{railroad}} official looked astonished as he turned it upside down for the spectators' information.

60|$|Now Ned {{was again}} {{to see what}} the slow and {{somewhat}} apathetic Dutch burghers could do when fairly roused to action. Every man capable of bearing a weapon was upon the walls, and not even in Haarlem was an attack received with more coolness and confidence. As the storming parties approached they were swept by artillery and musketry, and as they attempted to climb the breaches, boiling water, pitch and oil, molten lead and <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime</b> were poured upon them. Hundreds of tarred and blazing hoops were skilfully thrown on to their necks, and those who in spite of these terrible missiles mounted the breach, found themselves confronted by the soldiers and burghers, armed with axe and pike, and were slain or cast back again.|$|E
60|$|England {{under the}} Normans {{does not seem}} to have greatly desired to excel in {{maritime}} enterprise, but it was otherwise during the Plantagenet period. Henry the Second possessed a most formidable fleet, numbering some five hundred vessels of war. During the reign of his successor a novel artifice in naval warfare was resorted to by the English which merits notice. The English admiral caused a number of barrels of <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime</b> to be placed in his ships. Having brought his fleet to windward of the enemy--the French--he ordered water to be poured on the lime. This of course raised a great and dense smoke, which, being blown by the wind into the very faces of the French, prevented the latter from seeing on what quarter they were being attacked. A panic arose, and spread, among the French vessels, and the victory fell easily to the English.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{those very}} people, who, basely {{to comply with}} the {{brutality}} of Alvarez, had misused Father Xavier in his life, after his decease did honours to him; and many of them asked his pardon with weeping eyes, that they had forsaken him so unworthily in his sickness. Some amongst them exclaimed openly againt Alvarez, without fearing the consequence; and there was one who said aloud, what was said afterwards by the viceroy of the Indies, Don Alphonso de Norogna, [...] "That Alvarez de Atayda had been the death of Father Francis, both by his persecutions at Malacca, and by the cruelties of his servants at Sancian." [...] With these pious meditations, having laid the <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime</b> once more upon the face and body, the sacred remains were carried into the ship; and not long after they set sail, esteeming themselves happy to bear along with them so rich a treasure to the Indies.|$|E
6000|$|In pursuance of {{the first}} plan, he purposed to put a 'clime' upon the King's leg; rightly judging that that would mortify him to the last and perfect degree; {{and as soon as}} the clime should operate, he meant to get Canty's help, and FORCE the King to expose his leg in the highway and beg for alms. 'Clime' was the cant term for a sore, artificially created. To make a clime, the {{operator}} made a paste or poultice of <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime,</b> soap, and the rust of old iron, and spread it upon a piece of leather, which was then bound tightly upon the leg. This would presently fret off the skin, and make the flesh raw and angry-looking; blood was then rubbed upon the limb, which, being fully dried, took on a dark and repulsive colour. Then a bandage of soiled rags was put on in a cleverly careless way which would allow the hideous ulcer to be seen, and move the compassion of the passer-by. {8} ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Launcelot got up steam, he and I {{loaded up}} the kettle with <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime</b> and {{carbolic}} acid, {{with a touch}} of lactic acid added thereto, then filled the thing up with water and inserted the steam-spout under the canopy. Everything was ship-shape now, and we sat down {{on either side of the}} crib to stand our watch. Sandy was so grateful and so comforted that she charged a couple of church-wardens with willow-bark and sumach-tobacco for us, and told us to smoke as much as we pleased, it couldn't get under the canopy, and she was used to smoke, being the first lady in the land who had ever seen a cloud blown. Well, there couldn't be a more contented or comfortable sight than Sir Launcelot in his noble armor sitting in gracious serenity at the end of a yard of snowy church-warden. He was a beautiful man, a lovely man, and was just intended to make a wife and children happy. But, of course Guenever--however, it's no use to cry over what's done and can't be helped.|$|E
5000|$|A large cask of <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime</b> {{was found}} open on Chesapeakes {{forecastle}} and another bag of lime {{was discovered in}} the fore-top. British sailors alleged the intention was to throw handfuls {{into the eyes of}} Shannon’s men in an unfair and dishonourable manner as they attempted to board, though that was never done by Chesapeakes crew, and the historian Albert Gleaves has called the allegation [...] "absurd," [...] noting, [...] "Lime is always carried in ship's stores as a disinfectant, {{and the fact that it}} was left on the deck after the ship was cleared for action was probably due to the neglect of some subordinate, or petty officer." ...|$|E
5000|$|Between 27 BC and 102 AD, in Imperial Rome, women wore {{their hair}} in {{complicated}} styles: {{a mass of}} curls on top, or in rows of waves, drawn back into ringlets or braids. Eventually noblewomen's hairstyles grew so complex that they required daily attention from several slaves and a stylist {{in order to be}} maintained. The hair was often lightened using wood ash, <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime</b> and sodium bicarbonate, or darkened with copper filings, oak-apples or leeches marinated in wine and vinegar. [...] It was augmented by wigs, hairpieces and pads, and held in place by nets, pins, combs and pomade. Under the Byzantine Empire, noblewomen covered most of their hair with silk caps and pearl nets.|$|E

50|$|The {{blistering}} {{of painted}} surfaces {{may be caused}} in several ways. If on iron, {{it may be the}} result of a particle of rust which, not having been removed in the process of cleaning, has increased in size and loosened the paint. If on plaster, a particle of <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime</b> may have blown, with a similar result. On wood, blistering is usually caused by painting upon a wet surface or upon unseasoned wood. Blisters may also be caused by the use of too much oil in paint exposed to heat, or the application of one coat upon another before the latter is properly dry. To prevent blistering a method that has been tried with good results is to apply two coats of water paint (washable distemper) and follow by two coats of oil color or varnish. Cracking is caused by the use of too much oil in the under coats and too little in the topcoats.|$|E

40|$|The {{design and}} {{installation}} of a completely automated powdered lime plant during 1994 is described. This {{marked the beginning of}} a major expansion at Maidstone Mill. The conversion from rock lime, a rotary slaker and full time lime plant attendant to a completely automated plant producing milk of lime from powdered or ground <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime</b> was a first within Tongaat-Hulett Sugar. The advantages in lime handling, transport, process control, productivity and safety vastly outweigh the disadvantage of the additional cost of powdered lime. The installation costs are relatively high, however the operating costs show a nett saving in excess of R 50 000 per annum. As a process operation, the new plant has proved a great success...|$|E
40|$|Holocaust {{survivors}} {{report that}} at least 600, 000, if not {{as many as three}} million people primarily of Jewish faith were murdered in the Bełżec camp, located in eastern Poland, between November 1941 and December 1942. Various murder weapons are claimed to have been used: diesel exhaust gas, <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime</b> in trains; high voltage; vacuum chambers. According to the witnesses, the corpses of the victims were finally incinerated on pyres as high as a multi-story building without leaving any traces. For those who know the stories about the Treblinka camp, this all sounds too familiar. The author therefore restricted this study to the aspects, which are different and new compared to Treblinka, but otherwise refers the reader to his Treblinka book. In {{the first part of this}} book, the development of the official image portrait of the Bełżec camp is explained and subjected to a thorough critique.

40|$|The work {{describes}} various {{physical and}} chemical treatments to eliminate the deleterious effects of impurities in phosphogypsum on the delayed setting time and impaired strength development behaviour of cement to which it was added as a set regulator. The physical treatments included washing, milling, and ultrasonic treatment of the material, while the chemical treatments dealt with acidic and basic additions to the phosphogypsum during the washing stage. It was found that chemical treatment with a milk of lime solution, which is often recommended in literature, was ineffective in reducing set retardation. Treatment with ammonium hydroxide or sulphuric acid was more effective in this regard. Intergrinding phosphogypsum with slaked lime improved its effectiveness in reducing set retardation, {{but the use of}} <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime</b> was less effective and also resulted in marked reductions in compressive strengths. A combined treatment of wet milling phosphogypsum with a lime slurry in a ball mall was derived from these experiments and is recommended for full-scale plant applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{stabilisation}} of soft clay soils {{is intended}} to increase their shear strength and to reduce their compressibility. The possibility exists of using geophysical methods to monitor changes in these properties. Laboratory experiments were carried out on stabilised clays to study the relationships between shear wave velocity, and hence small strain shear stiffness, and shear strength or one-dimensional compressibility. One artificial clay, Speswhite kaolin, and two natural clays, from Malaysia and Sweden, were used as the base clays. Either ordinary Portland cement or a 1 : 1 mix of the cement with <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime</b> {{was added to the}} base clays in order to stabilize them. In {{the first part of the}} investigation, samples of stabilised clay were initially subjected to a non-destructive bender element test to obtain the shear wave velocity and then to an unconfined compressive strength test or vane shear strength test. It was evident that small stabiliser amounts (less than 10...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Industrial waste (which is {{composed}} of various toxic chemicals), changes to the disposal process, and addition of chemicals should all be monitored and controlled carefully in the industrial waste industry to reduce the health hazard to workers. CASE PRESENTATION: Five workers in an industrial waste plant developed acute toxic hepatitis, one of whom died after 3 months due to fulminant hepatitis. In the plant, we detected several chemicals with hepatotoxic potential, including pyridine, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, and methylenedianiline. The workers had {{been working in the}} high-vapor-generating area of the plant, and the findings of pathologic examination showed typical features of acute toxic hepatitis. DISCUSSION: Infectious hepatitis and drug-induced hepatitis were excluded by laboratory findings, as well as the clinical course of hepatitis. All cases of toxic hepatitis in this plant developed after the change of the disposal process to thermochemical reaction–type treatment using <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime</b> reacted with industrial wastes. During this chemical reaction, vapor containing several toxic materials was generated. Although we could not confirm the definitive causative chemical, we suspect that these cases of hepatitis were caused by one of the hepatotoxic agents or by a synergistic interaction among several of them...|$|E
40|$|Using {{recycled}} materials and by-products inpavements is a sustainable practice that isgaining adoption, particularly for hot-mix asphalt (HMA). HMA materials can be milled {{off the road}} surface and recycled. Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) consists of reprocessed HMA pavement material, such as asphalt and aggregates. RAP often contains high-quality, well-graded aggregates that are coated with asphalt cement but may include steel slag, a by-product of steel making. One approach is to incorporate large quantities of RAP into unbound aggregate base and subbase applications for highway construction. Problem Steel slag is an expansive aggregate often added when high frictional properties are required, as in HMA surface courses, particularly when good-quality aggregate is scarce. Steel slag, however, may contain free lime (CaO) and magnesia (MgO), which can react with water and cause the slag to expand. Volume changes of up to 10 percent or more {{have been attributed to}} hydration of the calcium and mag-nesium oxides in the recycled steel slag aggregate base course, caused by water seeping into the pave-ment base layer. The amount of expansion depends on the origin of the slag, the grain size and gradation, the hydration of <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime</b> and magnesia, and the age of the stockpile...|$|E
40|$|Various {{researches}} {{regarding the}} utilization of coal fly ash are currently being explored {{in order to increase}} its economic value as well as decrease its harm to environment. at the same time. The purpose of this reasearch is to know compressive pressure and weight of light-weight brick by using fired-coal waste from ”Asam-Asam” Coal Fired Steam Power Plant. The test result towards fly ash’s characteristics from ”Asam-Asam” Coal Fired Steam Power which has been done beforehand, is inline with the requirement of SNI 03 - 2460 - 1991. However the result of compressive pressure test still meets the requirement of SNI 03 - 0349 - 1989. Test has been conducted about compressive pressure and light-weight brick by using mixed materials of fly ash.   The compositions of light-weight brick’s production are cement and fly ash for 50 % each, including mixed foam, polymer and hardener, 0. 50 % for each of them, in order to achieve the highest average result of light-weight brick’s compressive pressure by 39. 99 kg/cm 2 or 3. 92 MPa. Meanwhile its density obtains 0. 78 kg/dm 3 or 780 kg/m 3. ‘D’ light-weight brick’s compositions are cement by 42. 86 % and fly ash by 28. 57 % including <b>unslaked</b> <b>lime</b> by 28. 57 %. Whereas the mixed compositions of foam, polymer and hardener for each 0. 50 % and 0. 38 %.
