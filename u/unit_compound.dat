40|$|Recent {{advances}} in the technology of recording magnetic fields associated with electric current flow in biological tissues have provided a means of examining action currents that is more direct and possibly more accurate than conventional electrical recording. Magnetic recordings are relatively insensitive to muscle movement, and, because the recording probes are not directly connected to the tissue, distortions of the data due {{to changes in the}} electrochemical interface between the probes and the tissue are eliminated. In vivo magnetic recordings of action currents of rat common peroneal nerve and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle were obtained by a new magnetic probe and amplifier system that operates within the physiological temperature range. The magnetically recorded waveforms were compared with those obtained simultaneously by conventional, extracellular recording techniques. We used the amplitude of EDL twitch force (an index of stimulus strength) generated in response to graded stimulation of the common peroneal nerve to enable us to compare the amplitudes of magnetically recorded nerve and muscle compound action currents (NCACs and MCACs, respectively) with the amplitudes of electrically recorded nerve compound action potentials (NCAPs). High, positive correlations to stimulus strength were found for NCACs (r = 0. 998), MCACs (r = 0. 974), and NCAPs (r = 0. 998). We also computed the correlations of EDL single motor unit twitch force with magnetically recorded single motor <b>unit</b> <b>compound</b> action currents (SMUCACs) and electrically recorded single motor <b>unit</b> <b>compound</b> action potentials (SMUCAPs) obtained with both a ring electrode and a straight wire serving as a point electrode.

The original soil surface is reconstructed using botanical and man-made datable objects. The soil loss rates are calculated by dividing the eroded soil volume {{by the age of}} the oldest datable object. Considering all compounds and landing sites in the study area, the average soil loss rate in compounds amounts to 107 Mg ha− 1 year− 1 (per <b>unit</b> <b>compound)</b> and to 207 Mg ha− 1 year− 1 per unit landing site. The soil loss from footpaths and unpaved roads is calculated by multiplying the total length of footpaths and unpaved roads with the average width and soil loss depth.

40|$|The {{reform of}} work unit (Danwei) system since 1980 s has {{substantially}} influenced spatial structure {{as well as}} people's life style in urban China. How to understand the great transformation of work unit system {{is very important to}} disentangle the socio-economic restructuring processes of Chinese cities. In this paper, we explained the origin, function and transformation of work unit system through literature study and enterprise interview, then we analyze the implication of work unit system reform, as one aspect of institutional changes in China, to people's daily life and urban spatial structure. There has been increasing interests in work unit system and its transformation. The earliest work came from sociological perspective, which has focused on such topics as the origin of work unit and its political-economic background, its organizational structures and power balance, multiple functions of a typical work unit, as well as the dependence of individuals to the work unit. In other words, sociologists pay more attention on the mechanism of work unit system, especially the control and dependence among the state, work unit and individual. Geographers, however, first noticed the role of work unit system through their studies on the urban spatial restructuring. Work unit system and its reform are regarded as the main constraints as well as impetus of the transformation of urban land use and social space. However, up to the present, many studies still remained rather descriptive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework of work unit studies, while arguing that geographers should and are able to combine the two approaches. Work unit system is a series of institutions and systems of production organization and social control based on work units, which includes two main systems: personnel administration system and welfare system. The former includes authorized staff administration system, employment system, wage system, and employee evaluation and training system. The latter includes housing welfare system, collective consumption system, entertainment welfare system, subsidy system, and social security welfare system. Thus, work unit becomes the "cell" of urban society in China, which not only controls resource allocation and production organization, but is responsible to the social control and social welfare. A work unit is more of a "whole community" than merely a factory or a administrative organization. Work unit system has experienced great transformation since the adoption of the reform and open policy. One fundamental change was the breakdown of the "whole community" of Danwei. Market mechanism was introduced into social production sphere. The organization of work units has gradually been marketized to meet the requirement of market competition. Therefore, social welfare system was gradually separated from work units, i. e. it has been socialized and marketized too. Work units are no longer responsible to the provision of housing, health insurance or other items of social welfare. The reform aimed at work unit system has been one main impetus of the transformation of people's life style and daily life space. Within work unit system, people not only work in Danwei, live in the dwellings allocated as a type of welfare within the Danwei compound (Dayuan). Thus, not only the social relationship, but also the daily life is constrained within Danwei compound. Since the reform, however, individual's dependence to Danwei and work unit system has been weakened. With the breakdown of work unit system, urban residents now have more freedom in choosing jobs and residence. Consequently, job mobility and residential mobility both have been increasing. Home-work relationship has also been greatly shifted, due to the relocation of job opportunities and residences, from home-work proximity to increasingly long-distance commuting. Besides, people's activity space {{is becoming more and more}} extended from work <b>unit</b> <b>compound</b> (Dayuan). For example, our empirical studies on individual shopping space and leisure space have reveal the expansion and differentiation of residents'daily activity spaces of urban China. Urban morphology also experienced substantial restructuring process accompany with the breakdown of work unit system. Urban expansion is now more generated and influenced by urban redevelopment, the construction of industrial parks and residential communities, contrary to the significance of the Danwei construction before the reform. Consequently to the expansion and diversification of people's commuting space, housing search space, and activity space (such as shopping space and leisure space), major cities in China has been facing substantial restructuring. In addition, there has been a more and more apparent trend of urban socio-spatial stratification based on residential location. In the end, we argue that work unit system, although weaken, is still an important factor, to some extent, in urban China, which we call "the concealment of Danwei system". In some cities, residents still expect a "whole community" of Danwei, and Danwei is still the main source of welfare of them. Therefore, work unit system, as well as its transformation continues to be one main perspective of understanding urban China, which requires further studies...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we will present Astec – an {{auxiliary}} spreadsheet tool for unit checking. Astec is built as an add-on to the open-source spreadsheet package Jeks. The software will perform unit checking in spreadsheets that {{make use of}} formulas with physical dimensions. This helps end users to quickly detect formula errors that occur due to invalid use of units. We introduce a mechanism that automatically converts <b>unit</b> factors into <b>compound</b> <b>units</b> as they are entered. Units are treated as in ordinary physics formulas by using a set of predefined conversion rules. We show that unit conversions can in fact be modeled as a shortest path problem, and we show how <b>compound</b> <b>units</b> can be simplified into smaller entities. ...|$|R

Acting Sergeant Pun, alone and believing he was about to die, decided to kill as many of the enemy as possible. During the engagement he reportedly spent all his ammunition (more than 400 rounds), used 17 hand grenades and a Claymore mine before battering the last fighter with the tripod of his machine gun. Two Taliban were still attacking his post when he set off the Claymore mine.|$|R
