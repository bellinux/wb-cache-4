60|$|A name, therefore, whether {{concrete}} or abstract, admits of definition, provided we {{are able}} to analyze, that is, to distinguish into parts, the attribute or set of attributes which constitute the meaning both of the concrete name and of the corresponding abstract: if a set of attributes, by enumerating them; if a single attribute, by dissecting the fact or phenomenon (whether of perception or of internal consciousness) which is the foundation of the attribute. But, further, even when the fact is one of our simple feelings or states of consciousness, and therefore <b>unsusceptible</b> <b>of</b> analysis, the names both of the object and of the attribute still admit of definition; or rather, would do so if all our simple feelings had names. Whiteness may be defined, the property or power of exciting the sensation of white. A white object may be defined, an object which excites the sensation of white. The only names which are <b>unsusceptible</b> <b>of</b> definition, because their meaning is <b>unsusceptible</b> <b>of</b> analysis, are the names of the simple feelings themselves. These are in the same condition as proper names. They are not indeed, like proper names, unmeaning; for the words sensation of white signify, that the sensation which I so denominate resembles other sensations which I remember to have had before, and to have called by that name. But as we have no words by which to recall those former sensations, except the very word which we seek to define, or some other which, being exactly synonymous with it, requires definition as much, words can not unfold the signification of this class of names; and we are obliged to make a direct appeal to the personal experience of the individual whom we address.|$|R

60|$|Again, {{though there}} are few {{commodities}} which are at all times and forever <b>unsusceptible</b> <b>of</b> increase of supply, any commodity whatever may be temporarily so; and with some commodities this is habitually the case. Agricultural produce, for example, can not be increased in quantity before the next harvest; the quantity of corn already existing {{in the world is}} all that can be had for sometimes a year to come. During that interval, corn is practically assimilated to things of which the quantity can not be increased. In the case of most commodities, it requires a certain time to increase their quantity; and if the demand increases, then, until a corresponding supply can be brought forward, that is, until the supply can accommodate itself to the demand, the value will so rise as to accommodate the demand to the supply.|$|R

40|$|A couple buys a couch. After delivery, {{they notice}} that {{the legs of the}} couch are not rectangular, like they ordered, but circular. After some angry calls and letters they {{introduce}} an action before the court to terminate the contract in order to get their money back. Against all expectations, the Belgian court of appeal of Ghent decides completely against the couple. According to the court, the couple disregarded the consumer sales rules in the Civil Code, implementing the EU Consumer Sales Directive. They did not respect the strict hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>remedies</b> which favors repair or replacement over termination and price reduction: the buyers should have sued for repair or replacement instead of trying to terminate the contract. Moreover, they transgressed the notification rules: they should have notified the seller about the shortcoming, before invoking a remedy. This case and many others, show that confusion reigns {{in the area of the}} organization <b>of</b> consumer sales <b>remedies.</b> The strict hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>remedies</b> imposed by the EU Consumer Sales Directive might be insufficiently protective for consumers. Moreover, after withdrawing the CESL -proposal, the EU Commission issued new projects, treating, among others, the contractual remedies in the e-commerce sector. Also in the US there is an on-going debate about the organization <b>of</b> <b>remedies</b> in contract law and the UCC. Over the last decades, many publications appeared about the irreparable injury-rule and adequacy-rule favoring damages over specific performance. It has drawn the attention of law & economics specialists, legal philosophers, and more recently the behaviorists have expressed their interest in the topic. At the same moment, academics are working on a restatement of US consumer contract law. The organization <b>of</b> <b>remedies</b> is a vivid topic, both in the US and EU. Nevertheless, a thorough cross-examination of the EU consumer sales law system (mainly based on the civil law tradition) and the US common law system is not sufficiently present in the current debate. Therefore, this paper will address this on the basis of in-depth comparative research. The paper firstly assesses the so-called 'hierarchy' <b>of</b> <b>remedies</b> that is prescribed by law. Another aspect that has an important impact on the aforementioned hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>remedies</b> are the different notification duties and their limitation periods. The last element that will be assessed and which greatly influences the hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>remedies</b> is the ability (or not) to invoke remedies extrajudicially. The main question is: what is the best possible organization <b>of</b> <b>remedies</b> to move forward to protect consumers? Answer to this question will be based on the principles of coherence of the legal system, legal certainty and the level of consumer protection. status: publishe...|$|R
