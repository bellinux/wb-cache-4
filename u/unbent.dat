Podeswa previously directed the fifth season episodes [...] "Kill the Boy" [...] and [...] "Unbowed, <b>Unbent,</b> Unbroken", the latter of which received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.

500|$|In {{the fifth}} season's episode [...] "Unbowed, <b>Unbent,</b> Unbroken", Sansa Stark is raped by Ramsay Bolton. Most reviewers, {{including}} those from Vanity Fair, Salon, The Atlantic, and The Daily Beast, found the scene gratuitous and artistically unnecessary. For example, Joanna Robinson, writing for Vanity Fair, {{said that the}} scene [...] "undercuts all the agency that's been growing in Sansa {{since the end of}} last season." [...] In contrast, Sara Stewart of The New York Post wondered why viewers were not similarly upset about the many background and minor characters who'd undergone similar or worse treatment. In response to the scene, pop culture website The Mary Sue announced that it would cease coverage of the series because of the repeated use of rape as a plot device, and U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill said that she would no longer watch it.|$|E

It is intriguing to consider whether the KBML has participated in this rotation, but this is unclear; that it is <b>unbent</b> where it crosses the OWL suggests it is not. [...] The OWL seems to be the northern edge of the rotating block, and the paucity of paleomagnetic data to the southeast of the KBML suggests it might be the southern edge.

2500|$|Business Insider noted a {{significant}} difference in the ratings between this season and previous seasons. The typical pattern involves [...] "Solid premiere viewings followed by a slow but steady gain of momentum through to the finale. Historically, the finale episodes of each season have beaten the premiere for total number of viewers". However, this season showed {{a significant}} decline from 8 million viewers at the premiere to 5.4 million at the seventh episode, [...] "The Gift". Business Insider cites two likely reasons for the lower ratings: backlash over the rape scene in [...] "Unbowed, <b>Unbent,</b> Unbroken", one of many deviations from the novels throughout the season that [...] "have upset fans," [...] and increased online streaming through HBO Now. It also acknowledged a possible effect of the first four episodes leaking online before the season premiere and the decision to air on Memorial Day weekend in the United States (a weekend that had been skipped in previous seasons). Business Insider reached out to HBO for comment, HBO responded that it is seeing an increase in overall viewer numbers this season taking into account streaming services, which are not included in Nielsen ratings. The dip in ratings did not extend to the eighth and ninth episodes, [...] "Hardhome," [...] and [...] "The Dance of Dragons", which were both seen by over 7 million viewers. The season finale, [...] "Mother's Mercy" [...] was seen by 8.11 million people, setting a new record and making it the most watched episode of the series.|$|E
2500|$|The United Daily {{newspaper}} {{referred to}} the Taiwan crossing paintings as [...] "a joy to view." [...] In the January 2006 issue of The Artist’s Magazine, which featured Yim’s Lady in Shimmering Light as its cover, Yim’s painting {{is described as a}} “stunning work” which has a “classic quality that crosses geographic and cultural boundaries.” [...] The prominent writer Li Ao, one of Taiwan's foremost public intellectuals, heaped similar praise on Yim's Mackay Practicing Medicine in a supplement to the Yangcheng Evening News in 2008 and also on his television show. [...] Lin Yong, former President of the Guangdong Artists' Association, waxes poetic in a memorable passage: [...] "Yim Mau-Kun has spent decades quietly, calmly, diligently and thoughtfully painting. [...] I don't know how many drawings and paintings he's created, and I don't know how many books he has read. [...] But over the decades, whenever we talk he often has impressive insights; he has never stopped thinking. [...] It's his diligence in studying, thinking, and articulating his thoughts that make me {{think of him as a}} Confucian scholar. [...] His insights have been very beneficial for me. [...] I see deep wrinkles in an old tree, ripples in a river, a rock unmoved by thunder and storms, a massive tree that remains <b>unbent,</b> and I see in Yim Mau-Kun a refreshing spring breeze." [...] Liang Jiang—former Deputy Director of the [...] National Art Museum of China and former Director of the Art Institute of China Army Academy—in the essay [...] "True to Himself" [...] for Taiwan's Arts and Literature Daily celebrates at length Yim's still lifes, landscapes, as well as Crossing the Stormy Strait and Reaching Shore. [...] Ned Jacob, nationally renowned artist and teacher at the Scottsdale Artists' School, in the foreword to A Classical Guide to How to Draw the Head speaks of [...] Yim as [...] "a craftsman of surpassing ability and sensibility," [...] a [...] "brave and vociferous champion of the classical legacy," [...] whose works [...] "resonate [...] virtuosity and boldness of handling[...] [...] [...]Treasures such as these – sacredly kept – will comfort us in those hours when fears and doubts come calling." ...|$|E
