40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} {{effectiveness}} of Chilean Regulatory Plans (Regional, Metropolitan and Municipal) to counter act Santiago’s socio economic segregation patterns. Particular types of segregation, country’s housing policy, Santiago’s land market dynamics and transport & infrastructure investments are analyzed to allow identify {{what is necessary to}} be achieved to counteract city’s segregation problems and which role regulatory plans can have in the solution. A first requisite for a regulatory plan to be effective in reducing Santiago’s segregation patterns is to have a clear goal regarding what is wanted to be achieved. Santiago segregation patterns involves all socio economic groups, but as the negative consequences of these patterns are been suffered by lower income groups, regulatory plans efforts should be directed on improving their situation. Therefore the goals of any proposal should be directed on counteract ‘low income group’s socially homogeneized segregated areas (south and north-west) ’ and ‘new low income inhabitants exclusion from city’s urban area’. Chilean urban development and lower income groups dwellings production is organized under a system where Governmental bodies sets urbanistic norms (in the case of urban development) or financial resources (in the case of social dwellings production) and private parties take development’s reponsability. After 30 year of ‘market’ functioning, city’s segregation problems have been consolidated and in some cases have worsened. An ‘effective’ proposal to counteract segregation problems cannot be based on market functioning because low income groups do not represent an ‘atractive market’ for private developers and also because market ‘free functioning’ have not allowed Governmental bodies to control urban developments quality (for instance the consolidation of low income segregated areas). Therefore an effective proposal to counteract segregation patterns requires an active involvement of the Governmet bodies with incidence over the urban space regarding social dwellings location and quality, to see short term results and to allow ensuring minimum standards of quality for those inhabitants who cannot make effective their residential choices (low income groups). Each public institution that has to be involved in a solution for segregation problems counts with their own instruments. Metropolitan Regulatory plans are definied by MINVU’s SEREMI Region Metroplitana and Municipal Regulatory Plans per each municipality. Thinking about an ‘isolated’ regulatory plan’s solution for segregation problems is not possible as these phenomas are the consequences of many factors that regulatory plans do not have the attributions to control. Regulatory plans role inside before indentified segregation pattern’s solutions are according to the challenges that each one represents: (1) ‘Low income group’s socially homogeneized segregated areas (south and north-west) ’ requires urban regeneration projects. Low income segregated areas social homogeinity hampers the arrival of private investments due to limited acquisition capacity of its inhabitants. An urban regeneration project should be aimed to break down this ‘residential monofunctionality’. MINVU’s <b>Urban</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Division</b> (DDU) can manage regeneration processes through the public call to tender for the design of an ‘Urban Regeneration Project’ (URP). Metropolitan and Municipal Regulatory Plans role in this solution is to allow URP implementation as they can provide the required ‘spatial territorial organization’ (densities, land uses, coefficients, etc) that the proposal requires to achieve its goals. Also Housing Policy subsidies, transport & infrastructure potential and the incidence of ‘Municipal Common Fund’ have to be considered. (2) ‘New low income inhabitant’s exclusion from city’s urban area’ requires a land generation policy. Due to city’s land values currently is not possible to develop social dwellings inside city’s urban area. The objective of ‘urban land generation’ is to allow well located social dwellings inside city’s urban areas with sufficient provision of facilities and services. Following the French model of a compulsory percentage of social dwellings per municipality, it is considered that this type of policy could have an effective impact on the demands of new lower income inhabitants of being located inside city’s urban area. Regulatory plans are considered as the suitable instrument for the application of this kind of measurements in the Chilean context. Regulatory plans allow to respond to local demands and to distinguish among the different urban centers according to their own characteristics. Situation that is not possible from policies (like housing policy) that rules country’s complete territory. Metropolitan regulatory plan could establish a ‘banwidth’ of the required surface per municipality that should be destinated for social dwellings; and also a criteria to determine per municipality the exact percentage of residential surface that should be considered (this criteria could be according municipalities’ infrastructure and facilities capacity). Each municipality (trough municipal regulatory plan) defines their percentage of social dwellings that could also be adapted according to the local demands that municipality management is able to detect. Also Housing Policy subsidies, transport & infrastructure connectivity and regulations to control land speculations could contribute to land generation policy implementation.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{question}} whether {{and to what extent}} <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics make use of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts to tackle tasks and challenges posed by immigration and the presence of migrants in cities. As a start, relevant migration-related issues with a connection to <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> are expounded. This is followed by the analysis of six <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts in terms of any migration and integration – related statements they may contain. The thesis consists of three chapters: in the first chapter, “migration” as the given central topic is identified and discussed following an examination of up-to-date specialist literature. There is a strong emphasis on the terminology used in current debates with particular attention given to the term “integration“. Another aspect of the first chapter is immigration in Germany: since its foundation, the Federal Republic of Germany has been a destination for immigrants; as a result, there are presently 12 million people from migrant backgrounds living in Germany. Among the main destinations were large West German cities, and within these cities specific districts which have consequently become rife with migration-related issues and problems. As a result, there are complex social, economic and spatial developments and phenomena which all have an impact on <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics: Population development, segregation, the housing situation, the educational situation, their economic potential and chances, cultural impact of the presence of migrants. These aspects and the subject of integration and their relevance to <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> are the main topics of the professional debate. “Migration” with its complex spatial and content-related implications thus offers a cross- section view of <b>urban</b> <b>development.</b> The second chapter addresses the subject of “urban development”. A brief retrospective highlights the general framework and paradigms of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> since the 1960 s and, above all, the use and implementation of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. The realisation here is that <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts do provide ideas and possibilities on how to handle migration-related issues and integrate these into <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics. Basic consideration of urban migration topics on one hand and <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics on the other hand have been the basis for developing a “migration evaluation” of selected current <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. Using a uniform investigation raster, it is explored how and to what extent these <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts contain statements on the migration-related topics mentioned above. The concluding examination in the third chapter returns to the initial questions: Is migration an integral part of current <b>urban</b> <b>development?</b> If so, how and to what extent? This will then lead to questions of whether the full potential of migration-related possibilities is being tapped and the restrictions and boundaries that apply. The overall conclusion is that <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics has so far failed to fully realise the importance of “migration” as an issue. <b>Urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts have been used with reserve to implement this issue in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics in an explicit, constructive and stringent manner. There {{can be no doubt that}} this is a difficult task. The appropriate consideration of issues of migration and integration in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts is met with various challenges: the complexity of this task cannot be ignored. However, this should by no means affect the comprehensibility of the problem; the significance of migration issues within <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts and the real life impact of these issues on <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> should correspond; <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts should be closely linked with other (professional) conceptions in the context of migration and integration. Migrants should be involved in the process of creating <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts in order to tap their resources, knowledge and potential for <b>urban</b> <b>development.</b> Finally, the thesis identifies existing gaps and areas in need of further research: <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts give but little indication of actual activity in the respective migration-related communal arenas; also, <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts are the result and expression of ongoing local politics debates, yet a discrepancy remains between the political aims and stances identified in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts and those discussed outside the realm of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. This discrepancy requires further analysis. A third gap has been identified between local politics objectives and actual local activity beyond political agendas. The thesis closes on the note that not only is there a need for migration to be recognised as an urban development-relevant matter but that there is ample reasoning for the integration of migration as a task in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics...|$|R

40|$|In {{the global}} {{knowledge}} economy, knowledge-intensive industries and knowledge workers are extensively {{seen as the}} primary factors to improve the welfare and competitiveness of cities. To attract and retain such industries and workers, cities produce knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> strategies, and therefore such strategising has become an important development mechanism for cities and their economies. The paper discusses the critical connections between knowledge city foundations and integrated knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> mechanisms in both the local and regional level. In particular, the paper investigates Brisbane’s knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> strategies that support gentrification, attraction, and retention of investment and talent. Furthermore, the paper develops a knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> assessment framework to provide {{a clearer understanding of}} the local and regional policy frameworks, and relevant applications of Brisbane’s knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> experience, in becoming a prosperous knowledge city.
