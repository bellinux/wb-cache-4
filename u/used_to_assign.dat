Although given a tight time frame of only three months, the new school was created on the location of Horwang School, and gradually absorbed the older school, the entire staff merging within a few years. ML Pin became the first director of the school, the country's first coeducational school, now known as Triam Udom Suksa School. It {{is widely regarded as}} one of the best schools in the country. During his term as director, which lasted until 1944, he developed and implemented a fixed class schedule system, along with a mechanical timetable <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> teaching periods, which is still in use today.|$|E
25|$|Many {{international}} classification societies have incorporated the Finnish-Swedish ice class rules {{to their own}} rulebooks and offer ice class notations that are recognized by the Finnish and Swedish authorities. These ice classes are, in turn, used by nations such as Estonia and Latvia to assign traffic restrictions. Since the ice class rules have been revised and amended several times over the years, a list of equivalent ice class notations is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> the correct official ice class for older vessels when they visit Finnish and Swedish ports. Although mainly used in the Baltic Sea, the Finnish-Swedish ice classes and the equivalent ice class notations from classification societies are sometimes used when discussing ships operating in other ice-infested seas of the world.|$|E

25|$|Avery et al. {{pioneered the}} use of choice {{modelling}} to rank colleges. Their methodology used a statistical analysis of the decisions of 3,240 students who applied to college in 1999. MyChances.net, now called Parchment, adopted a similar approach starting in 2009, stating that its method is based on this approach. The study analysed students admitted to multiple colleges. The college they attended became the winner, and the others became the losers. An Elo rating system was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> points based on each win or loss, and the colleges were ranked based on their Elo points. A useful consequence of {{the use of}} Elo points is that they can be used to estimate the frequency with which students, upon being admitted to two schools, will choose one over the other. Most recent preference ranking placed Stanford at the top, followed by MIT, Harvard, and Princeton.|$|E
25|$|Protein NMR {{utilizes}} multidimensional nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} experiments to obtain information about the protein. Ideally, each distinct nucleus in the molecule experiences a distinct electronic environment and thus has a distinct chemical shift by which it can be recognized. However, in large molecules such as proteins the number of resonances can typically be several thousand and a one-dimensional spectrum inevitably has incidental overlaps. Therefore, multidimensional experiments that correlate the frequencies of distinct nuclei are performed. The additional dimensions decrease the chance of overlap and have a larger information content, since they correlate signals from nuclei within a specific part of the molecule. Magnetization is transferred into the sample using pulses of electromagnetic (radiofrequency) energy and between nuclei using delays; the process is described with so-called pulse sequences. Pulse sequences allow the experimenter to investigate and select specific types of connections between nuclei. The array of {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} experiments used on proteins fall in two main categories — one where magnetization is transferred through the chemical bonds, and one where the transfer is through space, irrespective of the bonding structure. The first category is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> the different chemical shifts to a specific nucleus, {{and the second is}} primarily used to generate the distance restraints used in the structure calculation, and in the assignment with unlabelled protein.|$|E

[...] Spiral rainbands are such a basic {{structure}} to a tropical cyclone that in most tropical cyclone basins, use of the satellite-based Dvorak technique is the primary method used to determine a tropical cyclone's maximum sustained winds. Within this method, the extent of spiral banding and difference in temperature between the eye and eyewall is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> a maximum sustained wind and a central pressure. Central pressure values for their centers of low pressure derived from this technique are approximate.|$|E

500|$|The next {{collection}} {{was made in}} December 1801, when King George Sound was visited by HMS Investigator {{under the command of}} Matthew Flinders. On board were botanist Robert Brown, botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer, and gardener Peter Good. All three men gathered material for Brown's specimen collection, including specimens of B.sessilis, although neither Brown's nor Good's diary can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> a precise location or date for their discovery of the species. Good also made a separate seed collection, which included B.sessilis, and the species was drawn by Bauer. Like nearly all of his field drawings of Proteaceae, Bauer's original field sketch of B.sessilis was destroyed in a Hofburg fire in 1945. A painting based on the drawing survives, however, at the Natural History Museum in London. : parrot bush | work = DigitalCollections: Pictures | publisher = National Library of Australia | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an11944457 | accessdate = 12 October 2007}} ...|$|E

2500|$|Ubuntu's {{goal is to}} {{be secure}} [...] "out-of-the box". By default, the user's {{programs}} run with low privileges and cannot corrupt the operating system or other users' files. For increased security, the sudo tool is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> temporary privileges for performing administrative tasks, which allows the root account to remain locked and helps prevent inexperienced users from inadvertently making catastrophic system changes or opening security holes. PolicyKit is also being widely implemented into the desktop. Most network ports are closed by default to prevent hacking. A built-in firewall allows end-users who install network servers to control access. A GUI (GUI for Uncomplicated Firewall) is available to configure it. Ubuntu compiles its packages using GCC features such as PIE and buffer overflow protection to harden its software. These extra features greatly increase security at the performance expense of 1% in 32-bit and 0.01% in 64-bit.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{geological}} processes that have modified {{the lunar surface}} are impact cratering and volcanism, and by using standard stratigraphic principles (such as the law of superposition) {{it is possible to}} order these geological events in time. At one time, it was thought that the mare basalts might represent a single stratigraphic unit with a unique age, but it is now recognized that mare volcanism was an [...] ongoing process, beginning as early as 4.2 Ga and continuing to perhaps as late as 1.2 Ga (1 Ga = 1 billion years ago). Impact events are by far the most useful for defining a lunar stratigraphy as they are numerous and form in a geological instant. [...] The continued effects of impact cratering {{over long periods of time}} modify the morphology of lunar landforms in a quantitative way, and the state of erosion of a landform can also be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> a relative age.|$|E
