5|$|In short, an Indian cannot today gain a {{right of}} {{occupancy}} simply by occupying public land, as the Indians did in Cramer. <b>Under</b> <b>current</b> <b>law,</b> that occupancy could {{not be viewed as}} undertaken with the implied consent of the government, as was the occupancy in Cramer. We therefore conclude that any individual occupancy rights acquired by the Danns must have had their inception prior to November 26, 1934, the date that the lands in question were withdrawn from entry by Executive Order No. 6910.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's {{motion to}} dismiss for lack of Article III {{standing}} and failure to state a claim, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable <b>under</b> <b>current</b> <b>law,</b> the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing the plaintiffs is {{the current state of}} electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach of privacy, and this is the same issue faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss. Under U.S. law as of July 2012, it is only when a data breach results in actual loss as defined by applicable law that compensable damages arise. The case remained on the California court's docket as of July 2012.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{government}} is obligated <b>under</b> <b>current</b> <b>law</b> to make mandatory payments for {{programs such as}} Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) projects that payouts for these programs will significantly exceed tax revenues over the next 75 years. The Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) payouts already exceed program tax revenues, and social security payouts exceeded payroll taxes in fiscal 2010. These deficits require funding from other tax sources or borrowing. The present value of these deficits or unfunded obligations is an estimated $45.8trillion. This is the amount that {{would have had to}} be set aside in 2009 in order to pay for the unfunded obligations which, <b>under</b> <b>current</b> <b>law,</b> will have to be raised by the government in the future. Approximately $7.7trillion relates to Social Security, while $38.2trillion relates to Medicare and Medicaid. In other words, health care programs will require nearly five times more funding than Social Security. Adding this to the national debt and other federal obligations would bring total obligations to nearly $62trillion. However, these unfunded obligations are not counted in the national debt, as shown in monthly Treasury reports of the national debt.|$|E

25|$|The {{framework}} of U.S. immigration law has largely {{remained the same}} since 1965. The U.S. economy needs both high-skilled and low-skilled immigrant workers to remain competitive and to have enough workers who continue to pay into Social Security and Medicare as the U.S. population grows older. Nonetheless, there are currently very few channels for immigration to the U.S. for work-related reasons <b>under</b> <b>current</b> <b>law.</b> Furthermore, Amnesty International has taken concern regarding the excessive brutality inflicted upon illegal immigrants, which includes beatings, sexual assault, denial of medical attention, and denial of food, water and warmth for long periods.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the current}} {{constitution}} neither Jazmin Rotolo nor Alexandre Coste {{are in the}} line of succession as they are not Prince Albert's legitimate children, and he emphasized their ineligibility to inherit the throne in statements confirming his paternity.
