40|$|This article briefly {{describes}} the beneficial qualities, constructive uses, and profound cultural {{significance of the}} coca leaf for the indigenous Andean peoples highlighting examples from Bolivia – a country {{in the vanguard of}} the defense of the sacred leaf. More specifically I will describe the natural coca leaf’s renowned nutritional and therapeutic qualities, explain how coca has been used for millennia as a ritual tool for divination, social interaction, and as a link to deities and the mother earth that they worship. I will also explain how coca became institutionalized as a key cultural symbol of solidarity, identity, and resistance for the native Andean people in the face of colonial and neocolonial domination. I will then describe the implications of the recent boom in the economic value of coca caused by the increased demand from the cocaine industry, combined with pressures to completely outlaw and eradicate the coca leaf. These contradictory foreign demands for the drug cocaine and for the prohibition of the natural coca leaf threaten to deprive the traditional consumers of their coca, thus creating a powerful social force of rebellion arising in defense of the traditional meanings and uses of coca in the face of threats to this traditional way of life and the very identity of indigenous Andeans. I conclude this historical analysis by bringing <b>us</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>on</b> constructive uses of the leaf in wider society and the current struggle to recognize the coca leaf as an intangible heritage of humanity and access to its many beneficial qualities a basic human right for everyone. The Historical Use Value of Coca as a Food and Medicine Archaeological evidence has confirmed that the coca leaf has been cultivated and used by the indigenous people of the Andes region for at least 4, 000 - 5, 000 years while other estimates put this as far back as 20, 000 years. By the time of the Spanish colonial conquest, coca use extended all the way from what is today Costa Rica and Venezuela, through the Brazilian Amazon (coca’s place of origin) and on down to Paraguay, northern Argentina and Chile.

40|$|This {{small but}} {{competent}} book correctly {{concludes that the}} German experience in Oklahoma was extremely limited, primarily because the settlement of Germans there was sparse. In addition, the Germans, like most white settlers in the state, arrived only after periods {{of time spent in}} other states, notably in the Midwestern states of Nebraska, Wisconson, Iowa, and Illinois. In Oklahoma the Germans were concentrated {{near the center of the}} state in Kingfisher, Oklahoma, and Blaine counties. One in a series of small books treating the newcomer ethnic groups to Oklahoma, this volume contains a bibliographical essay and footnotes for each of its six chapters. An index is sadly missed. The chapters offer a general introduction; the patterns of German immigration to the United States; the settlement of Germans generally in Oklahoma; the three genuinely German counties of Kingfisher, Oklahoma, and Blaine; Oklahoma 2 ̆ 7 s Germans and World War I; and the German experience since World War I. The author brings <b>us</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> with information from the 1970 s. Chapter 2, which treats German immigration to the United States, relies almost entirely on two excellent publications: Walter F. Willcox, ed., International Migrations, 2 vols.

Other fine sources were ignored. However, this chapter is not crucial. Rohrs might have improved his book by devoting more of the limited space available to him by expanding chapters 4 (on the German counties) and 5 (on World War I).

40|$|Maria José, or Zé as she {{preferred}} to be called, was the national repre-sentative of Portugal for the SIL: we profited from her great efforts in keeping <b>us</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> with {{the latest developments in}} limnology, and for organising the bureaucratic aspects of SIL membership. After graduating in Biology at the University of Lisbon (Portugal), she continued her studies at Kent State University (Ohio, USA). It {{was at the end of}} her first year at Kent that she became fascinated by a paper published by Ramon Margalef in 1951, concerning the production of phosphatases by Daphnia (Boavida, 2010). This interest led to her choosing this subject for Master thesis topic (Boavida, 1981) and later to her Ph. D. studies. She demonstrated that zooplankters were really producing their own phosphatases and not only releasing those ingested with their algal food (Boavida and Heath, 1984). The role played by phosphorus, phosphorus regeneration and zooplankton interactions in lakes was a fundamental part of her scientific research, which contrib-uted to the development of limnology studies in Portugal. As a teacher, Maria José was well known for her carefulness in preparing her class lectures and guiding students, to whom she imparted her interests in the various phenomena shaping the dynamics of lakes. Many students and colleagues became interested in aquatic ecology through her inspiration and guidance. In order to encourage the learning of limnology by students, she translated into Portuguese the well known book Limnology by the famous limnologist Prof. R. G. Wetzel, who was Ze’s personal friend. The book was famously used by Zé as a syllabus in her course of “Limnologia ” at the University of Lisbon. Her curiosity and scientific knowledge, further developed in cooperation with researchers both at the University of Lisbon and at several research centres throughout the world, granted her the esteem from co-workers and students alike. As Prof. R. T. Heath recalls, Zé also had an impish sense of humour that made her an excel-lent companion in the laboratory. When she was studying in the US, she once made a Secchi disk from a button on a thread so the American students could compare the difference in strength between American coffee and European strength coffee.

40|$|Chapter 10, by Byron Dueck, brings <b>us</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date,</b> {{but also}} shifts {{analytical}} focus from the performativity {{of individuals to}} the way a relatively large group of musicians reflect on the performance (or not) of black identity in British jazz. Using interview material from the "What is Black British Jazz?" research project, he examines "a tangle in British discourse about jazz", specifically {{the way in which}} contemporary players often refute the suggestion that there is any such an entity as "black British jazz". That is, they rebut the idea of a homogeneous identity performed by black musicians. And there is also a concern not to be labelled as different or apart from British jazz, or just jazz, more generally. Dueck then sets this starting position of scepticism about "black British jazz" against a couple of other factors. One is the recognition that there definitely was a black British jazz, in the moment of the Jazz Warriors in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. Indeed, some musicians acknowledge that it still exists in the case of up-front, hybrid ensembles like Gary Crosby's Jazz Jamaica. But there is another dimension beyond the way in which musicians reflect on the performance (or not) of blackness, and that is advantage-disadvantage. In the terms we developed {{at the beginning of the}} section to attend to this topic represents a move from the perfomative considered as a field of creative agency to the notionally "lower" level of the social structural conditions under which musicians live and work. First, as Dueck shows, black people in Britiain are much less likely to receive higher education, especially in music, and this is considered by many of the interviewees to be a serious disadvantage. On the other hand, this could be advantageous in encouraging improvisation, experimentation and individualism, and perhaps perceived as being true to a certain idea of self-taught authenticity in jazz performance. Second, it seems likely that black musicians disproportionately attract a white audience, in a latter-day version of the exoticism which has dogged black musicians since the earliest days of jazz in Britain. This is acknowledged by both white and black musicians in the interviews which Dueck considers, and is often considered to be an unfair advantage, yet in this situation success may be most readily achieved by adhering to white expectations of black musicians (the long history of this in a British context is explored throughout this volume, beginning with Rye in Chapter 2) ...|$|R

5000|$|On the {{afternoon}} of September 8, 1863, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Frederick Crocker ("Acting Captain") was {{in command of the}} advance squadron composed of four gunboats. [...] Crocker was a veteran officer of considerable recent experience in Union river-gunboat actions and blockade duty. His ship was the , a steam-powered side-wheeler. Besides Clifton, Crocker's advance squadron included Granite City, Sachem, and Arizona, all recently commissioned ironclad warships. Less than three miles southeast downriver, well out of range of the Confederate fort's cannons, were anchored seven U.S. Navy transports carrying most of the U.S. Army soldiers of the landing force. [...] The U.S.S. Suffolk, hosting invasion force commander U.S. Army Major General Franklin and his staff, headed the seven-vessel squadron. Outside the principal Gulf shore sand bar, an additional two miles (3.2 km) downstream of this squadron, lay at anchor the remaining ships of the 22-vessel invasion fleet. The cited contemporary U.S. Army map shows the nominal positions of the bombardment fleet of four, the seven ships of the transport squadron, and the relative position farther out in the Gulf of the remaining vessels. The official reports of the battle generally reflect the map's information. [...] The total number of Union infantry assault troops in the landing force is given as 5,000 infantrymen, which included 500 listed as aboard the Granite City, those aboard the six troop transports in the seven-ship squadron headed by Suffolk, plus an artillery company somewhere among them. The first wave of 500 men aboard Granite City which steamed as close behind Clifton as possible but out of range of the fort's guns, were to land in the open space adjacent to and downstream of the fort. This was a flat, often muddy area already cleared of brush by the Confederate garrison as a clear field of fire for the canister and grape of the fort's artillery. The U.S. Army's invasion plan, therefore, absolutely required that the Confederate guns be silenced before any troops were debarked.
