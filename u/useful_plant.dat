5|$|Before {{the advent}} of agriculture, humans were hunter-gatherers. They foraged for edible fruit, nuts, stems, leaves, corms, and tubers, {{scavenged}} for dead animals and hunted living ones for food. Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing {{is thought to be}} the first example of agriculture; <b>useful</b> <b>plant</b> species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed. Plant breeding through the selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed. While the first evidence for the domestication of grasses such as wheat and barley has been found in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, it is likely that various peoples around the world started growing crops in the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC. Subsistence agriculture continues to this day, with many rural farmers in Africa, Asia, South America, and elsewhere using their plots of land to produce enough food for their families, while any surplus produce is used for exchange for other goods.|$|E
25|$|The Yurok people, who {{occupied}} the region before European settlement, carried out regular burnings of redwood forests to bolster tanoak populations {{from which they}} harvested acorns, to maintain forest openings, and to boost populations of <b>useful</b> <b>plant</b> species such as those for medicine or basketmaking.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} staple to {{the people}} who settled at Kintampo was the oil palm. The oil palm was used at Kintampo starting at least 4000 years ago. A very <b>useful</b> <b>plant</b> in many ways, it serves as a source of drink, food, and construction material. It was allowed to flourish in the region due to its preference for a constant warm climate and high rainfall. As a food, the oil can be extracted from the mesocarp which covers the plant, and the kernel which is also edible by itself. It is an excellent source of vitamin A, which would have helped to support a growing population.|$|E

60|$|It is said, {{there will}} be also added to this Bill a clause for {{diminishing}} the tithe of hops, in order to cultivate that <b>useful</b> <b>plant</b> among us: And here likewise the load is to lie entirely {{on the shoulders of}} the Clergy, while the landlords reap all the benefit. It will not be easy to foresee where such proceedings are like to stop: Or whether by the same authority, in civil times, a parliament may not as justly challenge the same power in reducing all things titheable, not below the tenth part of the product, (which is and ever will be the Clergy's equitable right) but from a tenth-part to a sixtieth or eightieth, and from thence to nothing.|$|E
60|$|It {{has often}} been remarked (9/14. De Candolle has {{tabulated}} the facts in the most interesting manner in his 'Geographie Bot.' page 986.) {{that we do not}} owe a single <b>useful</b> <b>plant</b> to Australia or the Cape of Good Hope, countries abounding to an unparalleled degree with endemic species,--or to New Zealand, or to America south of the Plata; and, according to some authors, not to America northward of Mexico. I do not believe that any edible or valuable plant, except the canary-grass, has been derived from an oceanic or uninhabited island. If nearly all our useful plants, natives of Europe; Asia, and South America, had originally existed in their present condition, the complete absence of similarly useful plants in the great countries just named would be indeed a surprising fact. But if these plants have been so greatly modified and improved by culture as no longer closely to resemble any natural species, we can understand why the above-named countries have given us no useful plants, for they were either inhabited by men who did not cultivate the ground at all, as in Australia and the Cape of Good Hope, or who cultivated it very imperfectly, as in some parts of America. These countries do yield plants which are useful to savage man; and Dr. Hooker (9/15. 'Flora of Australia' Introduction page 110.) enumerates no less than 107 such species in Australia alone; but these plants have not been improved, and consequently cannot compete with those which have been cultivated and improved during thousands of years in the civilised world.|$|E
6000|$|As once before, Sewell tacitly took a hint {{from his}} own experience, and {{enlarging}} to more serious facts from it, preached effort in the erring. He denounced mere remorse. Better not feel that at all, he taught; and he declared that what is ordinarily distinguished from remorse as repentance, was equally a mere corrosion of the spirit unless some attempt at reparation went with it. He maintained that though some mischiefs--perhaps most mischiefs--were irreparable so far as restoring the original status was concerned, yet every mischief was reparable in the good-will and the good deed of its perpetrator. Do what you could to retrieve yourself from error, and then, not leave the rest to Providence, but keep doing. The good, however small, must grow if tended and nurtured like a <b>useful</b> <b>plant,</b> as the evil would certainly grow, like a wild and poisonous weed, if left to itself. Sin, he said, was a terrible mystery; one scarcely knew {{how to deal with}} it or to attempt to determine its nature; but perhaps--he threw out the thought while warning those who heard him of its danger in some aspects--sin was not wholly an evil. We were so apt in this world of struggle and ambition to become centred solely in ourselves, that possibly the wrong done to another,--the wrong that turned our thoughts from ourselves, and kept them bent in agony and despair upon the suffering we had caused another, and knew not how to mitigate--possibly this wrong, nay, certainly this wrong, was good in disguise. But, returning to his original point, we were to beware how we rested in this despair. In the very extremity of our anguish, our fear, our shame, we were to gird ourselves up to reparation. Strive to do good, he preached; strive most of all to do good to those you have done harm to. His text was [...] "Cease to do evil." ...|$|E

6000|$|In that remote {{land where}} Martin was born, with its bright warm climate and rich soil, no person need go very long hungry--not {{even a small}} boy alone and lost on the great grassy plain. For {{there is a little}} <b>useful</b> <b>plant</b> in that place, with small leaves like clover leaves and a pretty yellow flower, which bears a {{wholesome}} sweet root, about as big as a pigeon's egg and of a pearly white colour. It is so well known to the settlers' children in that desert country that they are always wandering off to the plain to look for it, just as the children in a town are always running off with their halfpence to the sweet-stuff shop. This pretty white root is watery, so that it satisfies both hunger and thirst at the same time. Now when Martin woke next morning, he found a great many of the little three-leaved plants growing close to the spot where he had slept, and they supplied him with a nice sweet breakfast. After he had eaten enough and had amused himself by rolling over and over several times on the grass, he started once more on his travels, going towards the sunrise {{as fast as he could}} run. He could run well for a small boy, but he got tired at last and sat down to rest. Then he jumped up and went on again at a trot: this pace he kept up very steadily, only pausing from time to time to watch a flock of small white birds that followed him all the morning out of curiosity. At length he began to feel so hot and tired that he could only walk. Still he kept on; he could see no flowers nor anything pretty in that place--why should he stay in it? He would go on, and on, and on, in spite of the heat, until he came to something. But it grew hotter as the day advanced, and the ground about him more dry and barren and desolate, until at last he came to ground where there was scarcely a blade of grass: it was a great, barren, level plain, covered with a slight crust of salt crystals that glittered in the sun so brightly that it dazzled and pained his eyesight. Here were no sweet watery roots for refreshment, and no berries; nor could Martin find a bush to give him a little shade and protection from the burning noonday sun. He saw one large dark object in the distance, and mistaking it for a bush covered with thick foliage he ran towards it; but suddenly it started up, when he was near, and waving its great grey and white wings like sails, fled across the plain. It was an ostrich! ...|$|E

40|$|The {{plants have}} been all around us. In spite of their {{important}} role in life and survival of all living organisms, the plants have often been regarded by many as boring and useless. Because we want to {{raise the level of}} motivation during the class, we wanted to ascertain in this diploma work which <b>useful</b> <b>plants</b> inspired more or less interest among pupils in the primary school. We wanted to search out for plants by the help of which the determined curriculum could be more successfully carried out. We were also interested in the differences in answers among pupils with regard to the grade, sex and school that they attend. In the frame of regular class we distributed anonymous survey questionnaires to 402 pupils, attending 6 th to 9 th grade, in two primary schools in Ljubljana. The results of the research showed that pupils had positive attitude to <b>useful</b> <b>plants.</b> The first hypothesis was that younger pupils found interesting different <b>useful</b> <b>plants</b> than older pupils and it was partly confirmed. The second hypothesis stated that girls and boys found interesting different <b>useful</b> <b>plants</b> and was confirmed. The third hypothesis of no differences in interest of pupils from different primary schools to <b>useful</b> <b>plants</b> was partly confirmed, because we found two statistically significant differences among answers from pupils attending two different primary schools. ...|$|R
