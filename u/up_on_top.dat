5|$|Early {{shooting}} {{put more}} {{focus on the}} pool playing, but during filming Rossen {{made the decision to}} place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie's characters. Despite the change in emphasis, Rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah, through the positioning of the characters in the frame. For example, when Eddie is playing Findley, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah enters the room, she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of him. Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat Fats.|$|E
5|$|Founding {{member and}} lead singer Peter Gabriel {{decided to leave}} Genesis in late 1974, midway through the tour for the album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. The other members hoped he would reconsider, as {{they were still in}} debt and felt his {{departure}} could destroy the band's future, but ultimately accepted that he would leave. The remaining members felt they still wanted to collaborate musically, and show journalists and critics they were primarily a song writing team that could still produce good music. Keyboardist Tony Banks had been close to Gabriel personally, and did not want the band to split <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of seeing less of one of his best friends. He had written a number of songs for a possible solo project before deciding they should be used on the new Genesis album.|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom is a side-scrolling {{platform}} game {{in which}} the player controls the player character Ryu Hayabusa as he investigates the events behind Irene Lew's death. In the game, Ryu can jump, hang, and climb up and down walls with the control pad; pressing the jump button while holding the control pad the direction {{away from the wall}} causes Ryu to spring off the wall. Ryu is also able to attack enemies with secondary weapons while on a wall by pressing the attack button. A new feature introduced in Ninja GaidenIII is the ability for Ryu to hang overhead from pipes or ivy; he can swing <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> or drop from them, and as with walls, he can only attack enemies while hanging with secondary weapons.|$|E

25|$|The top {{and left}} {{edge of a}} JPEG image must lie on an 8×8 pixel block boundary, but the bottom and right edge need not do so. This limits the {{possible}} lossless crop operations, and also prevents flips and rotations of an image whose bottom or right edge does not lie on a block boundary for all channels (because the edge would end <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> or left, where– as aforementioned– a block boundary is obligatory).|$|E
25|$|Both the aluminium-polyethylene {{cladding}} and the PIR insulation plates failed {{fire safety}} tests conducted after the fire, {{according to the}} police. In 2014 safety experts cautioned that the planned insulation was only suitable for use with non-combustible cladding. The Guardian saw a certificate from the building inspectors’ organisation, Local Authority Building Control (LABC), which stated that the chosen insulation for the refit should be used on tall buildings only with fibre cement panels, which do not burn. Combustible panels with polyethylene were put <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of insulation known as Celotex RS5000, made from polyisocyanurate, which burns when heated giving off toxic cyanide fumes.|$|E
25|$|A {{hydraulic}} jump {{is a phenomenon}} in the science of hydraulics which is frequently observed in open channel flow such as rivers and spillways. When liquid at high velocity discharges into a zone of lower velocity, a rather abrupt rise occurs in the liquid surface. The rapidly flowing liquid is abruptly slowed and increases in height, converting some of the flow's initial kinetic energy into an increase in potential energy, with some energy irreversibly lost through turbulence to heat. In an open channel flow, this manifests as the fast flow rapidly slowing and piling <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of itself similar to how a shockwave forms.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} {{home for a}} series against the Colorado Rockies. Clayton Kershaw threw seven shutout innings {{in the first game}} of the series, leading the Dodgers to a 6–0 victory. In the second game, the Dodgers dropped the contest 3–2 in ten innings as reliever Octavio Dotel threw three wild pitches that led to the go-ahead run scoring. The Dodgers came <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> in the final game of the series, when Ted Lilly pitched a complete game, two-hit shutout and Reed Johnson hit a two-run home run for the only runs of the game, 2–0. The Cincinnati Reds came to town for the next series. The Reds came into the series with a streak of not having won a game at Dodger Stadium since 2005. They snapped that streak the first game, when Reds starter Homer Bailey shut down the Dodgers offense and the Reds capitalized on a throwing error by Dodger starter Carlos Monasterios to pull out a 3–1 victory. Monasterios started the game after Vicente Padilla was placed on the 15-day disabled list. The Dodgers offense, dormant for much of the second half of the season, finally showed up in the second game of the series. The Dodgers slugged back-to-back homers in both the second and third innings off Reds starter Johnny Cueto and held on for an 8–5 victory. However, the bats vanished again the following day as the Dodgers lost 5–2 despite a strong start from Clayton Kershaw, who struck out 11 in seven innings. In an effort to bolster their catching corps, depleted by Russell Martin's season-ending injury, the Dodgers acquired Rod Barajas off waivers from the New York Mets on August 22.|$|E
25|$|Liquid {{reveals that}} he plans to destroy the Patriots' core AI with a nuclear strike using Metal Gear REX's railgun, and that he will {{substitute}} the core with his own to gain control. To facilitate his plan, Liquid needs a non ID-tagged nuclear warhead, which is to be recovered from the Shadow Moses facility, familiar to Snake from prior adventures. Snake, tormented by old memories, infiltrates Shadow Moses Island and reaches REX's hangar only to be ambushed by Vamp who has Naomi with him. Raiden assists Snake in battling Vamp and ultimately kills him. Naomi, revealing she is riddled with cancer and tormented by her mistakes, disables her nanomachines holding off the cancer and dies. Snake and Raiden use REX to head out of the hangar and battle Metal Gear RAY, piloted by Liquid. Upon his defeat, Liquid reveals Outer Haven, a modified version of Arsenal Gear ready to fulfill his launch plan. Raiden is severely injured during the attack while defending Snake. The , captained by Mei Ling, arrives and begins firing on Haven, causing it to retreat. Seizing the moment it surfaces to launch the nuke, Snake, Meryl, and Johnny board the ship via catapults. When Snake arrives at the core, he uses Otacon's robot to install a computer virus coded by Naomi and Sunny, that destroys the core AI and the Patriot system controlling the entire world, leaving the bare necessity for the modern civilization to survive. The destruction of the Patriots brings the war economy to a halt, counteracts the Patriots' upcoming civilian control scheme, and causes a mental breakdown for the enemy soldiers as their mind-control systems are disabled. Snake, after passing out in the core room, awakes atop Outer Haven's tower to find Liquid. Liquid reveals to Snake that his plan the whole time was to have Snake himself defeat the Patriots while Liquid draw their attention to himself. Liquid also reveals to Snake that Eva died because of the FOXDIE virus Snake is carrying. The two engage in a tough and emotional battle, with Snake coming <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top.</b> After telling Snake a few last words, Liquid dies from the Foxdie virus as well.|$|E

[...] The Giants trailed 1–0 at that point, but scored seven runs to win, 7–1. [...] Eventually, the Giants won the series.

The tour set featured a small stage <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> {{of the main}} stage, where the band played with Usher and his supporting dancers left with enough room to perform. The smaller stage had a mini platform attached to it—which lowered to the main stage—and had two big staircases {{on both sides of}} it. To the left, a group of circular staircases climbed to the top, and to the right, there was a fire escape replete with steps and an elevator. Kanye West, who had finished his own headlining tour for his 2004 album The College Dropout, was the opening act for [...] "The Truth Tour".|$|E
500|$|In Tony Johnston's 2005 book, Neighbours: 20 Years of Ramsay Street, Charlene placed {{sixth in}} the twenty classic {{characters}} chapter. Johnston said Charlene and her mother represented [...] "the old and the new", that her career choice was unusual and her [...] "razor-sharp tongue" [...] put the fear into all the men who lusted after her. Johnston added that the younger female viewers admired Charlene, while the boys loved her feisty nature. In her book Soap Opera, Dorothy Hobson believed Charlene broke stereotypes, especially {{when it came to}} careers for women in the 1980s. She wrote, [...] "The sight {{of one of the most}} attractive female characters, dressed in overalls, with her cascading blonde curls tied <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of her head, was one of the most positive images for breaking the stereotypes of what jobs are suitable for girls." [...] Hobson also praised Charlene's on-screen relationship with Scott branding the positive images for young people as [...] "immense". The BBC News noted that Charlene became one of Neighbours most popular characters.|$|E

500|$|The stern section, which {{measures}} about [...] long, was catastrophically damaged during the descent and in {{landing on the}} sea bed. It had not fully filled with water when it sank and the increasing water pressure caused trapped air pockets to implode, tearing apart the hull. It was loud enough that multiple survivors reported hearing explosions about ten seconds after the stern had sank beneath the waves. Data from a sonar map made during a 2010 expedition showed that the stern section rotated like a helicopter blade as it sank. The rudder appears to have swung over to an angle of about 30–45° during the stern's descent, causing the section to follow a tight spiral to the bottom. It probably struck rudder-first, burying most of the rudder in the mud up {{to a depth of}} [...] The decks pancaked {{on top of each other}} and the hull plating splayed out to the sides of the shattered section.

500|$|Nala's {{role and}} {{demeanor}} during the film's romantic [...] "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" [...] sequence has drawn criticism {{in regards to}} her [...] "submissive behaviour". The New York Times Janet Maslin cited the film's lack of a strong heroine among its weaknesses, dismissing Nala and Simba's interaction throughout [...] "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" [...] as [...] "obligatory" [...] and [...] "gratuitous". Joel W. Martin wrote in the Journal of Religion and Film, [...] "One song later, [...] have fallen in love. Playing one day, they literally tumble down a hillside in the jungle, and he ends <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of her. This time, she does not bear her teeth, but instead, shows 'bedroom eyes'". Martin ultimately accused the scene's [...] "reversal of positions" [...] of [...] "establish male dominance." [...] Criticizing the film for [...] "being merely distracting when {{it could have been}} both meaningful and instructive", Robert Humanick of Slant Magazine wrote, [...] "Small potatoes, then, when Simba's former childhood friend and betrothed queen Nala ... unexpectedly reappears in his duty-free, protein-rich life, demanding he return to his kingly responsibilities and coaxing the lion to sleep tonight with arguably the most blatant 'fuck me now' face to ever appear in a PG-rated film." ...|$|E

Kanye West and Christina Milian was the opening act for the tour. Usher at select dates would bring out special guest, during his Atlanta show taping he brought out his artist at the time Rico Love to rap a verse on the song [...] "Throwback". During a more intimate part of the showing Ushers dancers selected singer Monica from the crowd to be serenaded by Usher while he sang album favorites [...] "Do it to Me" [...] and [...] "Superstar". Usher also performed Confessions Pt. II remix where Kanye would appear from back of the stage. Then lastly Usher would also bring out artist Lil Jon and Ludacris where they would finish the show performing the hit [...] "Yeah".
