25|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the uprising, it was {{believed}} by some that agents from Iran moved in amongst the population for the future channeling of Islamic revolution; an <b>unsubstantiated</b> <b>claim</b> which the Ba'athist regime was all too eager to propagate in their attempt to discredit the uprising. Finally, on 1 March, the uprising began in the southern city of Basra. With this, the tides of revolt spread throughout Iraq, from the southern marshes to the Kurdish mountains.|$|E

500|$|Ray's full 243-page {{report was}} {{unsealed}} and made public on October 18, 2000, {{three weeks before}} the Senatorial election. [...] It confirmed that neither Hillary Clinton nor David Watkins would be indicted. [...] It included some new detail, including a somewhat <b>unsubstantiated</b> <b>claim</b> from a friend of Watkins saying that the First Lady had told Watkins to [...] "fire the sons of bitches." [...] Ray cited eight separate conversations between the First Lady and senior staff and concluded: [...] "Mrs. Clinton’s input into the process was significant, if not the significant factor influencing the pace of events in the Travel Office firings and the ultimate decision to fire the employees." [...] Moreover, Ray determined Hillary Clinton had given [...] "factually false" [...] testimony when questioned by the GAO, the Independent Counsel, and Congress about the travel office firings, but reiterated that [...] "the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt" [...] that she knew her statements were false or understood that they may have prompted the firings.|$|E

The United States was warned that single aircraft {{would be forced}} down, and their crews would still be allowed to seek refuge, while bomber formations in violation of airspace would be intercepted. While American politicians and diplomats tried to minimize the political damage caused by these incidents, others took a more hostile view. Some senior commanders argued that as Switzerland was [...] "full of German sympathizers" [...] (an <b>unsubstantiated</b> <b>claim),</b> it deserved to be bombed. General Henry H. Arnold, Commanding General of the U.S. Army Air Forces, even suggested {{that it was the}} Germans themselves who were flying captured Allied planes over Switzerland in an attempt to gain a propaganda victory.|$|E
