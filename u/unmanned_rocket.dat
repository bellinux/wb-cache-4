50|$|In 1972, John J. Armstrong, a {{physically}} large and powerful inventor from New York, becomes {{concerned by the}} failures of seventeen manned and <b>unmanned</b> <b>rockets</b> to reach the Moon. Professor Bob Mandle, a young scientist, dies mysteriously while discussing the rocket failures with Armstrong.

Armstrong visits New Mexico, where the eighteenth Moon-rocket, to be piloted by George Quinn, is being built {{under the supervision of}} the obstructive Ambrose Fothergill. Armstrong also consults his friend Ed Drake, who worked on one of the earlier failed rockets, and Claire Mandle, to whom he feels an immediate attraction.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} it became available, the Titan IV was the most {{powerful}} <b>unmanned</b> <b>rocket</b> produced and used by United States, because the extremely large and powerful Saturn V rocket had not been available for some years. Still, the Titan IV {{was considered to be}} quite expensive to manufacture and use. By the time the Titan IV became operational, the requirements of the Department of Defense and the NRO for launching satellites had tapered off due to improvements in the longevity of reconnaissance satellites, and in addition, the declining foreign threat to the security of the United States that followed the internal disintegration of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the end of}} {{production}} and firing of NASA's huge Saturn IB and Saturn V rockets, the Titan IV was the largest and heaviest <b>unmanned</b> <b>rocket</b> available anywhere in the world, {{and especially in the}} Titan IV-Centaur version. The Titan IV-Centaur was used for special launches of heavy space probes into the Solar System, such as the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn which was launched in 1997. The Titan IV is no longer manufactured, and the last one of these was fired during a launch in October 2005. [...] In 1995 the aerospace division of Hercules, including its solid motor line, was acquired by the American defense contractor ATK.|$|E
50|$|The DoD {{stated in}} December 1984 that it {{planned to use}} about 20% of the 70 shuttle flights NASA planned over the {{following}} five years, with almost all military-related launches moving to the shuttle from unmanned rockets. Before the loss of Challenger in January 1986, however, ongoing launch delays caused DoD to express concern about overdependance on the shuttle. Despite Congressional and NASA opposition, in 1984 DoD began procuring a new <b>unmanned</b> <b>rocket</b> capable of launching shuttle-sized payloads into geosynchronous orbit. In 1985 it won approval to buy ten such rockets, which became the Titan IV. Challenger accelerated these plans but several NRO payloads only the shuttle could launch were grounded until it flew again, a dilemma NRO had feared {{as early as the}} mid-1970s.|$|E

50|$|After Tani {{received}} his bachelor's degree from MIT, {{he worked at}} Hughes Aircraft Corporation in El Segundo, California as a design engineer in the Space and Communications group. In 1986, he returned to MIT and {{received his}} master's degree in mechanical engineering in 1988, specializing in human factors and group decision making. After graduation, Tani worked for Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the experimental psychology department. In 1988, Tani joined Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) in Dulles, Virginia, initially as a senior structures engineer, and then as the mission operations manager for the Transfer Orbit Stage (TOS). In that role, he served as the TOS flight operations lead, working with NASA/JSC mission control {{in support of the}} deployment of the ACTS/TOS payload during the STS-51 mission in September 1993. Tani then moved to the Pegasus program at OSC as the launch operations manager. In that capacity, he served as lead for the development of procedures and constraints for the launching of the air-launched Pegasus <b>unmanned</b> <b>rocket.</b> Tani also was responsible for defining, training, and leading the team of engineers who worked in the launch and control room.|$|E
50|$|Little Joe 1A (LJ-1A) was an <b>unmanned</b> <b>rocket</b> {{launched}} {{as part of}} NASA's Mercury {{program on}} November 4, 1959. This flight, {{a repeat of the}} Little Joe 1 (LJ-1) launch, was to test a launch abort under high aerodynamic load conditions. After lift-off, the pressure sensing system was to indicate when the correct abort dynamic pressure was reached. This should have happened about thirty seconds after launch. A signal was sent to the explosive bolts to separate the spacecraft from the launch vehicle. Up to this point, everything was going as planned. The impulse was also intended to ignite the escape motor. The motor was ignited, but it took a number of seconds to build up thrust, and thus the abort maneuver was not accomplished at the desired dynamic pressure. Because of this, a repeat of the test was planned. Other events from launch through recovery occurred without incident. An altitude of 9 statute miles (14.5 km) and a range of 11.5 statute miles (18.5 km) were obtained, and a speed of 2,021.6 miles per hour (3,254 km/h) was reached. Flight time 8 minutes 11 seconds. Payload 1,007 kg.|$|E
