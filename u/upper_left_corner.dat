In the <b>upper</b> <b>left</b> <b>corner</b> on the blue stripe is a crown in yellow symbolizing the royal charter. The university also has a ceremonial flag, which is reserved for official university uses. The ceremonial flag is a square design of the Queen's coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Within several years, Xhinovci {{was forced}} to close Pizzeria Hitleri because local KLA commanders felt that it would tarnish the organization's image. Like many in post-war Kosovo, he {{encountered}} great financial difficulties and relied on his KLA service pension and financial assistance from relatives in Western Europe. Once his financial situation stabilized, Xhinovci opened a restaurant and named it Jehona after his oldest daughter. All of the restaurant's receipts were stamped with a black swastika in the <b>upper</b> <b>left</b> <b>corner.</b> The restaurant closed {{a few years after}} its opening for reasons unknown.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Pingali Venkayya {{submitted}} thirty new designs, in {{the form}} of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the <b>upper</b> <b>left</b> <b>corner,</b> a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag.|$|E

5|$|The {{same year}} Gaudí {{apparently}} {{took part in}} the construction of the , in collaboration with his disciple Francesc Berenguer, though the project's authorship is not clear or to what extent they each contributed to it. The style of the building evokes Gaudí's early work, such as the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions; it had an entrance gate in the shape of a fishing net, currently installed in the Park Güell. The building was demolished in 1939. Also in 1906 he designed a new banner, this time for the Guild of metalworkers and blacksmiths for the Corpus Christi procession of 1910, in Barcelona Cathedral. It was dark green in colour, with Barcelona's coat of arms in the <b>upper</b> <b>left</b> <b>corner,</b> and an image of Saint Eligius, patron of the guild, with typical tools of the trade. The banner was burned in July 1936.|$|E
5|$|Debates {{about the}} {{national}} flag occurred again in 1917 during the Vilnius Conference. Two colors, green and red, were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art. Artist Antanas Žmuidzinavičius decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates {{did not like the}} design as it was too dark and gloomy. Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in between the red (clouds lit up by the morning sun) and green (fields and forests). However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of Basanavičius, Žmuidzinavičius, and Daugirdas. On April 19, 1918, they submitted their final protocol to the Council of Lithuania. The flag {{was supposed to be a}} tri-color (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom) with Vytis in the <b>upper</b> <b>left</b> <b>corner</b> or in the middle. The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 Constitution of Lithuania did not include any mention of the coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any of the debates failed to produce a historical flag. Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered gold an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, green and red did not follow the existing rules of heraldry. However, no changes were made during the inter-war period.|$|E

25|$|The best {{possible}} prediction method would yield {{a point in}} the <b>upper</b> <b>left</b> <b>corner</b> or coordinate (0,1) of the ROC space, representing 100% sensitivity (no false negatives) and 100% specificity (no false positives). The (0,1) point is also called a perfect classification. A random guess would give a point along a diagonal line (the so-called line of no-discrimination) from the left bottom to the top right corners (regardless of the positive and negative base rates). An intuitive example of random guessing is a decision by flipping coins. As the size of the sample increases, a random classifier's ROC point migrates towards the diagonal line. In the case of a balanced coin, it will migrate to the point (0.5, 0.5).|$|E

25|$|Japanese Braille is a vowel-based abugida. That is, the glyphs are syllabic, {{but unlike}} kana they contain {{separate}} symbols for consonant and vowel, and the vowel takes primacy.

The consonants are written in the lower right corner (points 3, 5, 6) and cannot occur alone. However, the semivowel y is indicated by point 4, one of the vowel points, and the vowel combination is dropped {{to the bottom of}} the block. When this point is written in isolation, it indicates that the following syllable has a medial y, as in mya. Syllables beginning with w are indicated by dropping the vowel points {{to the bottom of the}} cell without additional consonant points.|$|E

Like Sweden's, Finland's national flag is based on the Scandinavian cross. It was adopted after independence from Russia, when many patriotic Finns wanted a special flag for their country, but its design dates back to the 19th century. The blue coloring is said to represent the country's thousands of lakes and the sky, with white for the snow that covers the land in winter. This color combination has also been used over the centuries in various Finnish provincial, military, and town flags.|$|E
