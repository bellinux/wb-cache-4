Consequently, {{in order to keep}} their life barrier-free as the others, all spaces should be planned, designed and applied for handicapped people. The perception that handicapped individuals are helpless and devour causes a social isolation from the community and this situation makes them hopeless and aimless. For this reason, designers should be sensitive to create and manage barrier-free design process in order to achieve equal life for everyone. Thus handicaped people can access social life fully and easly and these solutions let them free from physcial barriers which keep them out of public spaces. In this study Kızılelma Park, one of the biggest park in Niğde, is investigated in terms of accessibility.

Although a comparatively small element of the <b>urban</b> landscape, street <b>furniture</b> has a significant influence on the urban environment and urban life that it is largely placed in different urban areas and closely interacts with people—users—with different needs, wants, and preferences. As part of the <b>urban</b> landscape, street <b>furniture</b> design is necessary to consider the principles of unity and identity to achieve quality urban environment and urban life.

The provisions of open space are considered as a “lung” of the city whilst the urban structure as the nerve. The integration of these two factors can give “life” to the city.

40|$|AbstractUrban park {{design is}} always an {{interesting}} area in public design since urban parks {{play an important role}} in relaxation and recreation in Hong Kong. The design of seating can be a great support for users’ static activities in urban parks. Right now, most of the seating in urban parks are benches which allow a limited number of people to only sit in a line. The user preferences of seating patterns in urban parks were investigated in this study. An interview was conducted in Kowloon Park in Hong Kong and 29 park users were interviewed. Participants were asked to arrange their most preferable seating pattern with a group of 2 to 5 friends in a public park. Results showed that there were various styles of seating patterns: line, partial circle, circle and others. Selection of preferred seating pattern was related to number of group members. For the group with 2 friends, participants chose line style most often. The percentages of line style and partial style decreased when the number of friends increased from 2 to 5 in the group. They chose circle style most for the setting of 3 or more friends. Participants explained that circle style can help them to interact better, use more eye contact and create a shorter distance. This study suggested that circle style, or flexible seating pattern or arrangement might be a better option than fixed line style in the design of <b>urban</b> park seating <b>furniture...</b>|$|R
40|$|Street {{furniture}} {{refers to}} the objects and facilities located in urban public spaces that provide various services and functions to the public. It {{is one of the}} essential elements of the urban environment. However, today, many policymakers, designers and the public neglect its importance. Although comparatively small in scale when compared to apartment blocks, office towers and other <b>urban</b> buildings, street <b>furniture,</b> together with other urban landscape elements such as architecture and urban space, plays a significant role in contributing to the lives of people and their activities. Of all the urban landscape elements, street furniture has the closest contact and most dynamic interaction with people and the environment. Street furniture interacts with all city users, offering physical usage and helping them communicate with each other. At the same time, it interacts with the environment by providing focus points, establishing linkages between different landscape elements, and also by coordinating with a place's identity. The interaction function of street furniture greatly contributes to a convenient urban life, and hence determines the quality of an urban environment. This paper discusses the roles of street furniture and the different kinds of interaction among specific elements thereof. Through a variety of case studies, this paper examines and analyses how street furniture interacts with and affects urban life in different ways. It advocates for the importance of street furniture in constructed environments, and encourages planners in government as well as users to emphasise street furniture design. School of Desig...|$|R

The aim of this publication is increasing the awareness about the works of women who worked in Europe as well as European women who worked outside Europe over the last 100 years (1918 - 2018). Forty-five authors from Universities and Research centres all around Europe contributed to writing texts, and more than 300 women among architects, civil engineers, landscape designers, <b>urban</b> planners, <b>furniture</b> and interior designers are listed in the "Index of names". The book consists of four main sections: the first " 100 Works, 100 Years, 100 Women" is a catalogue of the MoMoWo international travelling exhibition, the second presents the "Chrono MoMoWo" timeline on women achievements, the third "Thematic Essays" is devoted to historical and critical articles, and the last publishes the results of the MoMoWo international photo competition "Reportage on Women's Designer Own Home". In the first section " 100 Works, 100 Years, 100 Women" is a collection of entries covering 28 countries in Europe and beyond. Each entry is devoted to a work was conceived to able to reveal traces of the historical period, culture and society that designed, produced and used it. Each entry text was formulated to be directly or indirectly able to underline a system of historical, cultural and social relationships, mentioning also building and production practices and technologies. Taking into account that each work also epitomises an achievement in the author's life each work description was flanked by a biography of the designer. Biographical texts were formulated in order to highlight the career - including the barriers encountered - and prizes or awards received. Taking into account the meaning of MoMoWo's collection will derive from its ability to provoke a conscious process of attributing meaning by its readers. To support this dialectical process and to avoid the risk of treating "history as a series of ‘sequentia fixa' or even closed ‘totalities'", 13 Thematic Essays were conceived in order to provide the reader with arguments that cross and break the linear sequence, sometimes bypassing the geographical confines of Europe and offering examples and comparisons worldwide. This book wishes to build up a repertory of tangible and intangible cultural ‘signs' capable of fostering comparisons and connections between memory and future, encouraging new mappings of women's creativity in Europe...|$|R

50|$|In his {{furniture}} workshop, Day {{tended to}} employ his own design style {{for all of}} his pieces; this style evolved with popular stylistic trends throughout his few decades as a successful and skilled craftsman. Day’s work is characterized by improvisational subscription to popular urban styles of the time and his designs were methodical and symmetrical. Scholars of African and African-American art and design widely agree that this facet of Day’s style could reflect his racial heritage, since African and African-American art was highly creative and improvised, with visible rhythms in the designs. However, American design scholars warn against attributing Day’s entire design style to his African heritage, because American rural furniture designers of all races often creatively and spontaneously elaborated on popular stylistic themes as well. Essentially, Day took basic structures and ideas from <b>urban</b> trends on <b>furniture</b> designs and elaborated on them utilizing his personal creative taste. This habit of utilizing popular designs, combined with the cost-efficient production methods in his workshop through steam power, made Day’s designs not only symbols of status for customers through their style, but also competitively priced. Based on stylistic analysis, it appears that Day pleaded many of his basic design structures for his various furniture pieces from a craftsman pattern book by John Hall, the Cabinet Makers’ Assistant, especially his use of s-shape curves.Day enjoyed employing both horizontal and vertical curvature ornamentations that balanced each other out. Scholars argue that his craftsmanship focused on creating a balance of motion in his pieces, where curvilinear designs as well as scroll motifs suggested motion to the eye, while the interplay between the horizontal and vertical directions, as well as the negative space between such curves, created a sense of balance in the piece. On many of his tables, Day carved animalistic paws, even adding carved fur, onto the clawed foot style that was fashionable at the time, as well as adding carved foliage resembling tobacco leaves. These stylistic choices further illustrate Day’s tendency to take popular designs and add his own regional twist, with the tobacco leaves referencing his own tobacco farm as well as the tobacco-growing tradition in North Carolina.|$|R
