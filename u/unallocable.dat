40|$|Resource Management Agency's (County) Indirect Cost Rate Proposals (ICRPs) {{for fiscal}} year (FY) 201112012 and FY 2012 / 2013 to {{determine}} whether the ICRPs were presented in accordance with Title 2, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 225. Based on audit work performed by the SCO, we determined the County's ICRPs are presented in accordance with Title 2 CFR, Part 225. The approved indirect cost rates are 42. 43 percent and 59. 86 percent of total direct salaries and wages plus fringe benefits for FY 2011 / 2012 and FY 2012 / 2013, respectively. These rates supersede the FY 2011 / 2012 rate of 57. 64 percent and the FY 2012 / 2013 rate of 77. 12 percent oftotal direct wages and fringe benefits stated in our Acceptance Letters dated July 25, 2011, and July 10, 2012. Since the audited indirect cost rates are lower than the previously accepted rates, the County is required to reconcile all prior reimbursement claims using the lower audited rates. Any resulting overpayment should be repaid to Caltrans within 30 days or by the next billing cycle, whichever occurs first. The SCO auditors excluded <b>unallocable</b> fleet service and legal counsel charges totaling $ 653, 383 and $ 712, 956 for FY 2011 / 2012 and FY 2012 / 2013, respectively. In addition, the audit determined that the indirect costs were overstated because the county included unallowable contingency settlement charges of $ 44, 358 in FY 2011 / 2012 and $ 45, 797 in FY 2012 / 2013.
