25|$|Until {{the early}} 18th century, {{virtually}} all European small craft and many larger vessels were built without formal plans being drawn. Shipwrights would construct models to show prospective customers how the full size ship would appear and to illustrate advanced building techniques. These were also useful for marine artists, {{and it is}} clear that from Dutch Golden Age Painting onwards extensive <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>models</b> was made by artists.|$|E

25|$|In {{a classic}} set of experiments, the Englishman Osborne Reynolds (1842–1912) of the University of Manchester {{demonstrated}} that the airflow pattern over a scale model {{would be the same}} for the full-scale vehicle if a certain flow parameter were the same in both cases. This factor, now known as the Reynolds number, is a basic parameter in the description of all fluid-flow situations, including the shapes of flow patterns, the ease of heat transfer, and the onset of turbulence. This comprises the central scientific justification for the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>models</b> in wind tunnels to simulate real-life phenomena. However, there are limitations on conditions in which dynamic similarity is based upon the Reynolds number alone.|$|E
500|$|Lara Weller {{followed}} McAndrew from 1999 to 2000. Subsequent {{models were}} Lucy Clarkson from 2000 to 2002 and Jill de Jong, {{who wore a}} new costume based on Lara Croft's new appearance in Angel of Darkness from 2002 to 2004. Karima Adebibe became the model from 2006 to 2008, and wore a costume based on the updated version of Croft in Legend. She was the first model Eidos allowed to portray Lara Croft outside posing for photography. To prepare for the role, Adebibe trained in areas the character was expected to excel in like combat, motorcycling, elocution, and conduct. Gymnast Alison Carroll, succeeded Adebibe in 2008 and featured apparel based on the character's appearance in Underworld. Similar to Adebibe, Carroll received special training—Special Air Service (SAS) survival, weapons, and archaeology—to fill the role. Crystal Dynamics discontinued the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>models</b> {{as part of the}} franchise's second reboot. The number of models prompted Guinness World Records to award the character an official record for the [...] "most official real life stand-ins" [...] in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{researchers}} in the Arctic also benefit from computer models. [...] These pieces of software are sometimes relatively simple, but often become highly complex as scientists try to include more and more elements of the environment to make the results more realistic. [...] The models, though imperfect, often provide valuable insight into climate-related questions that cannot be tested in the real world. [...] They are also {{used to try to}} predict future climate and the effect that changes to the atmosphere caused by humans may have on the Arctic and beyond. [...] Another interesting <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>models</b> has been to use them, along with historical data, to produce a best estimate of the weather conditions over the entire globe during the last 50 years, filling in regions where no observations were made (...) [...] [...] These reanalysis datasets help compensate for the lack of observations over the Arctic.|$|E

2500|$|Quantifying dietary {{exposure}} most often involves the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>models.</b> Dietary exposure models vary in complexity {{depending on the}} tier, or level of detail of the assessment {{in which they are}} utilized. Lower tier models may be deterministic and use single point estimates for inputs whereas higher tier models may be more stochastic, utilizing probabilistic [...] inputs. Simple {{dietary exposure}} models calculate dietary intake of the chemical of concern as the product of the mass of the food item consumed during the specified time period and the average concentration of the contaminant in the item. This basic approach is also used in more complex models; however, the contributions of various food items and types are summed as inputs. Exposure model outputs can be expressed as a single point estimates or as a probability distribution. In general, the more robust and extensive the input data, the more accurate the estimate of exposure.|$|E

The few genuine vintage aircraft used included a Deperdussin used as set dressing, and the flyable 1912 Blackburn Monoplane [...] "D" [...] (the oldest genuine British aircraft still flying), belonged to the Shuttleworth Trust based at Old Warden, Bedfordshire. When the filming was completed, the [...] "1910 Bristol Boxkite" [...] and the [...] "1911 Roe IV Triplane" [...] were retained in the Shuttleworth Collection, Both replicas are still in flyable condition, albeit flying with different engines.

60|$|Here again, just as {{with the}} {{language}} teaching, hardly any of us are really fully educated. We suffer, nearly all of us, {{from a lack of}} quantitative grasp and from an imperfect grasp of form. Few of us have acquired such a grasp. Few of us ever made a proper <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>models,</b> and nearly all of us have miserably trained hands. Given proper facilities--and here again I ask you to note that proviso--given proper educational facilities, most of us would not only be able to talk with most people in the world but we should also have a conception of form and quantity far more subtle than that possessed by any but a few mathematicians and mechanical geniuses to-day.|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of a state-local negotiation process to implement Model Standards in 18 California local health departments was conducted during 1985 - 87. Model Standards specific to California were developed by state and local public health officials for seven programs. Nine counties participated in state-local negotiations to set performance standards in these seven programs. During the two-year effort, greater <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Model</b> Standards and more improvement in local program performance occurred in local health departments that participated in the state-local negotiation process. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Model</b> Standards appeared to contribute to establishing program priorities, emphasizing the measurement of outcomes, improving data management systems, and evaluating the current performance of programs. While this state-local negotiation process is suggested as the preferred approach to encouraging the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Model</b> Standards in local health departments, it must be recognized that this process requires time and commitment of resources from {{both the state and}} local levels...|$|R
