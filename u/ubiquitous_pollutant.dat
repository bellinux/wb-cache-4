To test the hypothesis that benzene and its metabolites can initiate hyper-recombination and to investigate the potential role of ROS, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line containing a neo direct repeat recombination substrate (CHO 3 – 6), was used to determine whether benzene or its metabolites phenol, hydroquinone, catechol, or benzoquinone initiated increase...|$|E

These sometimes countervailing factors are illustrated with several scenarios of wastewater treatment technology and population growth in the Phoenix area.

We analyzed liver toxicity at 18 months following gestational PFOA exposure in CD- 1 and 129 / Sv strains of mice and compared PFOA-induced effects between strains and in wild type (WT) and PPARa-knockout (KO) 129 /Sv mice. Pregnant mice were exposed daily to doses (0. 01 – 5 mg/kg/BW) of PFOA from gestation days 1 to 17.

Hepatocellular adenomas formed in PFOA-exposed PPARa-KO 129 /Sv and CD- 1 mice and were absent in untreated controls from those groups andWT 129 /Sv. Hepatocellular hypertrophy was significantly increased by PFOA exposure in CD- 1, and an increased severity was found in WT 129 /Sv mice. PFOA significantly increased nonneoplastic liver lesions in PPARa-KO mice (hepatocyte hypertrophy, bile duct hyperplasia, and hematopoietic cell proliferation).

PBMT reduced the generation of nitrites and hydrogen peroxide and increased oxidative burst in the lung cells.

After incubation with 20 µM TCHQ for 1 hr, all mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) examined [i. e., extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), p 38, and c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) ] were phosphorylated, whereas no clear phosphorylation was induced by PCP. TCHQ-induced apoptosis was markedly suppressed by treatment with a p 38 inhibitor (SB 203580) and mildly (but significantly) suppressed by treatment with a MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor (U 0126). When cells were treated with both inhibitors at the same time, TCHQ-induced apoptosis disappeared almost completely. PCP-induced apoptosis was also suppressed by SB 203580 and/or U 0126. Nevertheless, treatment with LL-Z 1640 - 2, which inhibits JNK phosphorylation, did not suppress the apoptosis caused by either TCHQ or PCP.

Mercury (II) is a strong, “invisible” poison that is rapidly absorbed by tissues of the intestinal tract, kidneys, and liver upon ingestion. In this study, a novel fluorescence-based biosensor is presented that allows for the direct monitoring of the uptake and distribution of the metal under noninvasive in vivo conditions. With the introduction of a cysteine residue at position 205, located in close proximity to the chromophore, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Aequorea victoria was converted into a highly specific biosensor for this metal ion. The mutant protein exhibits a dramatic absorbance and fluorescence change upon mercuration at neutral pH. Absorbance and fluorescence properties with respect to the metal concentration exhibit sigmoidal binding behavior with a detection limit in the low nanomolar range. Time-resolved binding studies indicate rapid subsecond binding of the metal to the protein. The crystal structures obtained of mutant eGFP 205 C indicate a possible access route of the metal into the core of the protein. To our knowledge, this engineered protein is a first example of a biosensor that allows for noninvasive and real-time imaging of mercury uptake in a living cell. A major advantage is that its expression can be genetically controlled in many organisms to enable unprecedented studies of tissue specific mercury uptake...|$|E

For this purpose, rats were randomly divided into four groups and treated with 0. 0, 0. 64, 1. 2 and 3. 2 mgkg− 1 body weight (BW) for the period of 90 days. The group treated with lower dose (0. 64 mgkg− 1 BW) showed an insignificant change in all the peaks, except the peaks assigned to olefinic CH, CH 2 asymmetric and CH 2 symmetric stretching vibration in the lipids. While, the groups treated with higher doses (1. 2 and 3. 2 mgkg− 1 BW) showed the significant decrease in the area under the peaks corresponds to different bio-molecules. In addition, spectral second derivative analysis showed the significant alteration in α-helix, turns, β-sheet, aggregated β-sheet and random coil structures in the proteins. In conclusion, the selected higher dosage of cyanide had caused significant decrease in the biochemical composition of rat sperms along with structural changes in the proteins.

Laccase activity was induced in the presence of the pollutants and anthraquinone was found as anthracene product of oxidation by laccases. Moreover, the addition of these pollutants into soil did not affect the functional diversity of autochthonous microbial communities assessed by Ecolog plates. Cellulase, protease and urease activities increased in soils watered with UV-LED treated wastewaters (UV-LED WW), showing transformation of organic matter from the effluent and lipase activity increased by anthracene addition, confirming the potential role of these enzymes as indicators of hydrocarbon contamination.
