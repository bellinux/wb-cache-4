The study area is composed of terrigeneous clastics in fluvial [...] lacustrine environments, which contain formation water with salinity ranging from less than 1000 to 12, 000 mg/l. Water composition varies with depth and hydrochemical regions. In the <b>underpressured</b> strata deposited during the rifting period, formation water is characterized by water type of CaCl 2 with higher salinity.

40|$|The San Juan Basin {{natural gas}} field, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado in the USA, is a case-type coalbed methane system. Groundwater {{is thought to}} {{play a key role}} in both {{biogenic}} methane generation and the CO 2 sequestration potential of coalbed systems. We show here how noble gases can be used to construct a physical model that describes the interaction between the groundwater system and the produced gas. We collected 28 gas samples from producing wells in the artesian overpressured high production region of the basin together with 8 gas samples from the <b>underpressured</b> low production zone as a control. Stable isotope and major species determination clearly characterize the gas in the high production region as dominantly biogenic in origin, and the <b>underpressured</b> low producing region as having a significant admix of thermogenic coal gas. 3 He/ 4 He ratios increase from 0. 0836 Ra at the basin margin to 0. 318 Ra towards the center, indicating a clear but small mantle He signature in all gases. Coherent fractionation of water-derived 20 Ne/ 36 Ar and crustal 4 He/ 40 Ar* are explained by a simple Rayleigh fractionation model of open system groundwater degassing. Low 20 Ne concentrations compared to the model predicted values are accounted for by dilution of the groundwater-associated gas by desorbed coalbed methane. This Rayleigh fractionation and dilution model together with the gas production history allows us to quantify the amount of water involved in gas production at each well. The quantified water volumes in both <b>underpressured</b> and overpressured zones range from 1. 7 × 103 m 3 to 4. 2 × 105 m 3, with no clear distinction between over- and <b>underpressured</b> production zones. These results conclusively show that the volume of groundwater seen by coal does not play a role in determining the volume of methane produced by secondary biodegradation of these coalbeds. There is no requirement of continuous groundwater flow for renewing the microbes or nutrient components. We furthermore observe strong mass related isotopic fractionation of 20 Ne/ 22 Ne and 38 Ar/ 36 Ar isotopic ratios. This can be explained by a noble gas concentration gradient in the groundwater during gas production, which causes diffusive partial re-equilibration of the noble gas isotopes. It is important for the study of other systems in which extensive groundwater degassing may have occurred to recognize that severe isotopic fractionation of air-derived noble gases can occur when such concentration gradients are established during gas production. Excess air-derived Xe and Kr in our samples are shown to be related to the diluting coalbed methane and can only be accounted for if Xe and Kr are preferentially and volumetrically trapped within the coal matrix and released during biodegradation to form CH 4...|$|R

Two calderas are silicic (Katmai in 1912 and Pinatubo in 1991), and two are basaltic (Fernandina in 1968 and Miyakejima in 2000). All events have sufficient geophysical, geologic, and petrologic data with which to examine and model magma withdrawal and caldera collapse. The data reveal that the magmas erupted at Katmai and Pinatubo were in a bubbly state in the reservoir immediately before and during caldera collapse. The bubbly magma allowed for its efficient extraction from the reservoir, causing significant <b>underpressures</b> to develop rapidly, {{particularly in the case}} of Katmai where the erupted rhyolite was voluminous and nearly aphyric and has very low viscosity. The rapidly developing <b>underpressures</b> at Katmai and Pinatubo caused sudden en masse caldera collapse halfway through the climactic eruptions, thereby liberating large amounts of seismic energy. At Fernandina and Miyakejima, by contrast, caldera collapse was initiated early and continued {{for an extended period of}} time from weeks to months, consisting of a series of discrete subsidence events manifested by large earthquakes at Fernandina and by very long period (VLP) signals at Miyakejima.

The maximum subsidence rate in {{the peak of the}} anomaly is ∼ 3. 5 cm yr^(− 1), and the average volumetric rate of subsidence is of the order of 10 ^ 6 m^ 3 yr^(− 1). The radar interferograms reveal a complex deformation pattern, with at least two irregular subsidence peaks {{in the northern part of}} the anomaly and a region of relative uplift on the south. We invert the InSAR displacement data for the positions, geometry, and relative strengths of the deformation sources at depth using a nonlinear least squares minimization algorithm. We use elastic solutions for a prolate uniformly pressurized spheroidal cavity in a semi-infinite body as basis functions for our inversions. Source depths inferred from our simulations range from 1 to 3 km, which corresponds to the production depths of the Coso geothermal plant. <b>Underpressures</b> in the geothermal reservoir inferred from the inversion are of the order of 0. 1 – 1 MPa (except a few abnormally high <b>underpressures</b> that are apparently biased toward the small source dimensions). Analysis of the InSAR data covering consecutive time intervals indicates that the depths and/or horizontal extent of the deformation sources may increase with time.

40|$|Geological {{carbon dioxide}} storage (GCS) has been {{identified}} as an important strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Due to their potentially large CO₂ storage capacity, deep saline aquifers have been investigated globally with respect to storage suitability, injectivity and potential impact on the environment and other basin resources. The relatively large area of pressure impacts associated with large-scale GCS has been identified previously as an important issue. One aspect of GCS in saline aquifers that has previously not been considered widely in the assessment of injection impacts and storage capacity is the history of regional production-induced <b>underpressuring</b> in many petroleum-producing sedimentary basins. The Latrobe aquifer in the Gippsland Basin in southeastern Australia is a potential candidate for large-scale GCS. The Latrobe Group forms a major freshwater aquifer in the onshore Gippsland Basin and contains hydrocarbon reservoirs in the offshore parts of the basin up to 6000 m below the seafloor. The emphasis of the current modelling was to examine the cumulative impacts of CO₂ injection and petroleum production on the regional flow and displacement of formation water. With respect to the Gippsland Basin specifically, the simulations suggest that GCS has the potential to partially reverse the recent trend of water level declines in the onshore area of the Latrobe aquifer, thereby reducing impacts on water resources and the risks of land subsidence. Also, CO₂ injection may provide pressure support for the significantly <b>underpressured</b> petroleum-producing regions in the offshore portion of the Latrobe aquifer. The Latrobe aquifer has adequate storage capacity and injectivity for storing a total of at least 2000 MtCO₂, which would be sufficient for storing Victoria's annual CO₂ emissions from large stationary sources for the next 20 years and, most likely, beyond. The radius of increased pressures in response to injecting the required volume of CO₂ in the centre of the basin would be on the order of 20 km, if the production-induced pressure decline in the Latrobe aquifer is taken into account. In comparison, injecting the same amount of CO₂ in an unstressed aquifer would result in pressure impacts at a distance of up to 80 km from the storage site; hence a significantly larger area would need to be monitored. Generally, the CO₂ injectivity for a pressure-depleted aquifer is likely to be higher than that for a hydrostatically-pressured aquifer, and the difference should be related to the volumes of previous petroleum and associated water production. CO₂ injection and petroleum production operating independently can result in significant over- or <b>underpressuring</b> in a basin, potentially causing land uplift/subsidence or contamination of groundwater. The simulation results in this study suggest that, given the right injection concept, unwanted pressure changes and associated impacts could be significantly reduced when CO₂ injection and petroleum production operated conjunctively.
