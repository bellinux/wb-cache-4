5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Blatty worked {{as the public}} {{relations}} director at Loyola University of Los Angeles and as a publicity director at the University of Southern California. He published his first book, Which Way to Mecca, Jack? in 1960, a humorous look at both his early life, and {{his work at the}} <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Agency</b> in Lebanon. In 1961, while still working in public relations, Blatty appeared as a contestant on the Groucho Marx quiz show You Bet Your Life, winning $10,000, enough money to quit his job and to write full-time. Thereafter, he never held a regular job.|$|E
5|$|Fields' {{career as}} a film editor {{commenced}} in 1960, when the director Irving Lerner recruited her to be {{the editor of the}} film Studs Lonigan; Fields and Lerner had both worked on The Savage Eye. In 1963 she edited An Affair of the Skin, which was directed by Ben Maddow (another Savage Eye contact). Over the next five years, Fields edited several other independent films; the best known is The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle (1967), which was shown on the television program Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color.

5|$|In Germany, {{there were}} major {{issues to be}} decided. Germany was still {{occupied}} by the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain and France. Dealing with the wartime allies was a major task for the high commissioner. West Germany, {{made up of the}} zones occupied by the three western powers, had been granted control of its own affairs, except for defense and foreign policy, in 1949. While most Germans wanted a neutral and reunited Germany, the Eisenhower administration sought to reduce its defense spending by rearming Germany and replacing American troops with Germans. Meanwhile, the House Un-American Activities Committee slammed Conant's staff as communist sympathizers and called for books by communist authors held in <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Agency</b> (USIA) libraries in Germany to be burned.|$|E
5|$|In late 1990 after Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein invaded and {{occupied}} Kuwait, ultimately {{leading to the}} Gulf War, American commentators and Middle East experts {{expressed concern about the}} possible consequences of the Arab street in the region rising up in support of Saddam against their own governments, many of whom (particularly Egypt) had joined the military coalition led by the United States. This did not happen when the actual war began, nor for the hundred days of combat before Iraqi forces retreated and surrendered. A year later, in 1992, David Pollock of the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Agency</b> (USIA) wrote a lengthy paper arguing that those commentators had seriously misunderstood the Arab street and, by extension, all Arab public opinion.|$|E

5|$|The various {{agencies}} {{that participated in}} Operation PBHistory had different aims in mind for {{the products of the}} operation. The CIA was most interested in using the information gathered against communist movements in Latin America and elsewhere. The State Department wanted to use them to reconstruct the history of the communist party within Guatemala, while the highest priority of the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Agency</b> was to use the documents to release information {{that could be used to}} change international opinion. The agents in charge of the operation were expected to balance these various interests: however, as the organization behind the operation, the CIA had veto power over any public use. The work done by the PBHistory team assisted two existing CIA operations, Operation Kufire and Operation Kugown, both of which had been a part of Operation PBSUCCESS.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas narrated the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Agency's</b> 1964 film Nine from Little Rock. In {{the film}} Thomas said, [...] "If Little Rock taught us nothing more, it {{taught us that}} {{problems}} can make us better. Much better." [...] The goal of this government film, {{in the context of}} the Cold War, was to show, to countries concerned about American racism, the progress the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> had made with respect to civil rights. It achieved this goal at least in part as the film received wide acclaim (including an Academy Award) and was distributed to 97 countries.|$|R
40|$|Winning the {{war against}} the Axis {{countries}} was not the only goal the US government had in mind; it was also working towards a new US led world order. Analysis of three illustrated magazines produced by the Office of War Information Overseas Branch for the Netherlands shows that in addition to short-term war-related goals, long-term goals sought {{to pave the way for}} the American Century. This essay also shows that, more than previously assumed, the content and approach of the activities undertaken by the OWI Overseas Branch during the last phase of the war anticipated the <b>State</b> Department's and <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Agency's</b> post-war programs...|$|R
40|$|Having {{come to the}} end of {{a ten-year}} study of Belize {{developing}} libraries, the Belize government asked for a survey of all the tertiary school libraries within the country. The government purpose centered around the number and caliber of staff, book/journal collections, student use and adequacy of the facility housing the collections. When adequacy of any of the above failed criteria, they asked for recommendations for improvement within the eleven schools visited. Thanks to the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Agency’s</b> Academic Specialist Award, the study, followed by training workshops, took place from February 3 - 6, 1990.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} consumerism in American propaganda. Its main objective is to show the strategy by which the American government used consumerism and consumer goods to legitimize its regime abroad. This case study is mainly focused on the 1950 s and it {{is divided into three}} parts. The first part addresses the attitudes of the world public towards the American consumerism {{at the beginning of the}} Cold War, the beginnings of the American information programs fighting against the rising anti-Americanism, and also the exhibitions promoting the Marshall Plan. The second part is dedicated to the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Agency's</b> operations, to the U. S. participation in international trade fairs, and to the development of the People's Capitalism concept. The third part dissects the American National Exhibition in Moscow, which represented one of the biggest achievements of the American overseas propaganda. This thesis, therefore, analyses how the consumerism was integrated into the American ideology and became a key element in the struggle of the Cold War...|$|R
40|$|With President Truman’s ‘Campaign of Truth’ in the Fifties, Voice of America (VOA) {{established}} {{itself as}} one of the most important information programmes of the US government. The 20 million dollar budget allocated to VOA in those years enabled it to employ about 1, 900 people and to broadcast in 45 different languages. Italy, with its strong and threatening Communist Party, w{{as one of}} VOA’s main targets. Audience research however (performed by the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Agency’s</b> Italian branch and by the Italian opinion poll company Doxa) shows that the Italians always preferred their own national network RAI. The US government therefore started to target the RAI, with the aim of placing VOA-produced programmes directly on the Italian network in order to reach a mass audience. This article looks into what went on both ‘on’ and ‘off the air’, analyzing how various Italian ‘target groups’ were addressed by VOA. Drawing on documents from the National Archives and Records Administration in both Washington DC and New York City, and from the Doxa archives in Milan, the study examines how the American government prepared itself to conquer the Italian network RAI. ...|$|R
