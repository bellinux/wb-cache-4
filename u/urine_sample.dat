Twenty five workers collected their <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> before the work shift, after 4 h of work and after the work shift. The analyses of <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> and solvents used in dry-cleaning were performed using TLHS-DAI-GC-ECD.

Monitoring HPV prevalence in adolescents could offer a near-term biological measure of vaccine impact, and <b>urine</b> <b>sampling</b> may be an attractive large-scale method {{that could be used for}} this purpose. Our objective was to provide an overview of the literature on HPV DNA detection in <b>urine</b> <b>samples,</b> with an emphasis on adolescents. We searched the PubMed database using the terms &ldquo;HPV&rdquo; and &ldquo;urine&rdquo; and identified 21 female and 14 male study populations in which HPV prevalence in <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> was reported, four of which included only asymptomatic female adolescents. We provide herein an overview of the recruitment setting, age, <b>urine</b> <b>sampling</b> procedure, lesion type, HPV assay, and HPV prevalence in <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> and other urogenital samples for the studies included in this review. In female study populations, concordance for any HPV type and type-specific concordance in paired <b>urine</b> and cervical <b>samples</b> are provided in addition to sensitivity and specificity. We concluded that few studies on HPV prevalence in <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> have been performed in asymptomatic female adolescent populations but that <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> may be a useful alternative to cervical samples to monitor changes in HPV prevalence in females in the post-HPV vaccination era. However, care should be taken when extrapolating HPV findings from <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> to the cervix. In males, <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> do not seem to be optimal for monitoring HPV prevalence due to a low human genomic DNA content and HPV DNA detection rate compared to other urogenital sites. In each situation the costs and benefits of HPV DNA detection in urine compared to alternative monitoring options should be carefully considered.

5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of reprogramming ordinary cells present in urine into immature brain cells that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012. Instead of using retrovirus, they used vectors which the researchers say is a breakthrough This does not involve embryonic stem cells which come with serious drawbacks when transplanted, such as the risk of developing tumours.

This research proves human excreta could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some of the problems of using stem cells, and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new drugs that are being developed to treat them.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe {{kinetics}} {{of three}} serological markers (IgM, IgA, and IgG) in serum, saliva, and <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> from adult patients with primary or secondary dengue infection were studied. DesignSerum, saliva, and <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> {{were collected from}} 22 patients with clinical and confirmed dengue 3 virus infection during the outbreak in Havana City in 2001. They were tested by capture IgM (MAC-ELISA), IgA (AAC-ELISA), and IgE (EAC-ELISA) and IgG ELISA inhibition method (EIM) to detect specific dengue antibodies. ResultsSimilar kinetics were observed in IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies in saliva and IgA and IgG in <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> from secondary cases compared with kinetics in serum samples, although the values were lower. No IgG antibody was detected in saliva and <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> in primary cases and IgM antibody was not detected in <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> from either primary or secondary infection. All secondary cases were positive for IgG in saliva and <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> at day 7. The kinetics of specific IgE antibodies in primary and secondary cases were different. ConclusionsThe kinetics of three serological markers (IgM, IgA, and IgG) in serum, saliva, and <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> from adult patients with primary or secondary dengue 3 virus infection were studied for the first time, showing its behavior and usefulness in dengue virus diagnosis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Methods {{based on}} spot <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> (a single sample at one time-point) have been {{identified}} as a possible alternative approach to 24 -hour <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> for determining mean population salt intake. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study is to}} identify a reliable method for estimating mean population salt intake from spot <b>urine</b> <b>samples.</b> This will be done by comparing the performance of existing equations against one other and against estimates derived from 24 -hour <b>urine</b> <b>samples.</b> The effects of factors such as ethnicity, sex, age, body mass index, antihypertensive drug use, health status, and timing of spot urine collection will be explored. The capacity of spot <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> to measure change in salt intake over time will also be determined. Finally, we aim to develop a novel equation (or equations) that performs better than existing equations to estimate mean population salt intake. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data will be conducted. A search has been conducted to identify human studies that report salt (or sodium) excretion based upon 24 -hour <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> and spot <b>urine</b> <b>samples.</b> There were no restrictions on language, study sample size, or characteristics of the study population. MEDLINE via OvidSP (1946 -present), Premedline via OvidSP, EMBASE, Global Health via OvidSP (1910 -present), and the Cochrane Library were searched, and two reviewers identified eligible studies. The authors of these studies will be invited to contribute data according to a standard format. Individual participant records will be compiled and a series of analyses will be completed to: (1) compare existing equations for estimating 24 -hour salt intake from spot <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> with 24 -hour <b>urine</b> <b>samples,</b> and assess the degree of bias according to key demographic and clinical characteristics; (2) assess the reliability of using spot <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> to measure population changes in salt intake overtime; and (3) develop a novel equation that performs better than existing equations to estimate mean population salt intake. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 538 records; 100 records were obtained for review in full text and 73 have been confirmed as eligible. In addition, 68 abstracts were identified, some of which may contain data eligible for inclusion. Individual participant data will be requested from the authors of eligible studies. CONCLUSIONS: Many equations for estimating salt intake from spot <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> have been developed and validated, although most have been studied in very specific settings. This meta-analysis of individual participant data will enable a much broader understanding of the capacity for spot <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> to estimate population salt intake...|$|R

Ten <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> (and the corresponding serum samples) were compared by Western blot (WB) analysis. Thirty-five out of the 95 <b>urine</b> <b>samples</b> were found positive, 57 were found negative, and 3 were found inconclusive for antibody detection by the protein A ELISA.
