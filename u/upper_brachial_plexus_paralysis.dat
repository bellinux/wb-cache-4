50|$|<b>Brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> injury affects {{cutaneous}} sensations {{and movements}} in the upper limb. They {{can be caused by}} stretching, diseases, and wounds to the lateral cervical region (posterior triangle) of the neck or the axilla. Depending on the location of the injury, the signs and symptoms can range from complete paralysis to anesthesia. Testing the patient's ability to perform movements and comparing it to their normal side is a method to assess the degree of <b>paralysis.</b> A common <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> injury is from a hard landing where the shoulder widely separates from the neck (such {{as in the case of}} motorcycle accidents or falling from a tree). These stretches can cause ruptures to the superior portions of the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> or avulse the roots from the spinal cord. <b>Upper</b> <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> injuries are frequent in newborns when excessive stretching of the neck occurs during delivery. Studies have shown a relationship between birth weight and <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> injuries; however, the number of cesarean deliveries necessary to prevent a single injury is high at most birth weights. For the <b>upper</b> <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> injuries, <b>paralysis</b> occurs in those muscles supplied by C5 and C6 like the deltoid, biceps, brachialis, and brachioradialis. A loss of sensation in the lateral aspect of the upper limb is also common with such injuries. An inferior <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> injury is far less common, but can occur when a person grasps something to break a fall or a baby's upper limb is pulled excessively during delivery. In this case, the short muscles of the hand would be affected and cause the inability to form a full fist position.|$|R

Six patients with <b>upper</b> <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> or musculocutaneous nerve injuries were assessed; 2 were iatrogenic nerve injuries following shoulder arthroscopy or neurofibroma resection. Direct and indirect signs of neuropathy were objectified with MR neurography. Moreover, clinical and electrodiagnostic follow-up was performed and all patients completed the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand score. Mean follow-up was 48 ± 21. 9 (range, 20 - 73) months. Mean age was 40 ± 11. 3 years and mean delay to surgery was 9 ± 3. 2 months. All patients were satisfied with the functional results and the median Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand score was 21 (range, 1 - 57).

The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the results of nerve {{transfer}} to the musculocutaneous and axillary nerves, using some technical modalities such as intercostal, spinal accessory or intraplexal transfer, and on the basis of the results to try to clarify the most common controversies concerning these operations.

One hundred and forty-eight neonates, who experienced birth trauma, were prospectively identified and compared with 280 normal neonates. Both groups were delivered vaginally. Maternal and infant characteristics were evaluated as possible risk factors for fetal injury. Results: Among the 148 infants with birth trauma, nine had multiple injuries.
