40|$|Introduces {{himself and}} sends a few {{specimens}} from Georgia {{at the request}} of John Fraser. Also sends the root of an <b>unknown</b> <b>palm</b> from East Florida with a sample of the starch procured from it, knowledge of which having come from the Seminole Indians. Has an extensive collection of Georgian specimens but is anxious to know which plants are also native to Europe. Refers to a desiderata and requests 'Convolvulus salopa', for reason of it generally being supposed to be Michaux's 'Ipomoea macrorhiza'. From experiments has deduced that 'I. macrorhiza' possesses no purgative qualities and may be eaten like 'C. batatas'...|$|E
5000|$|H. James Palmer, {{having no}} {{seat in the}} Legislature and {{ultimately}} having lost {{the confidence of the}} Legislature, resigned from politics and did not run in this election. It is therefore <b>unknown</b> if <b>Palmer</b> led the Liberals in this election, though his biography at the PEI Legislative Documents Online http://www.peildo.ca/fedora/repository/leg%3A25447 archive makes reference to the [...] "Palmer-led Liberals." [...] There is no other listed leader for the Liberals during the election; Assemblyman John Richards led the Liberals as Leader of the Opposition in the 37th Legislature.|$|R

40|$|Palm wine (Elaeis guineensis) was sensorially {{evaluated}} {{and the key}} odorants were investigated by means of high resolution gas chromatography-olfactometry and mass spectrometry of solvent extracts as well as headspace samples. A total of 41 compounds were identified, 32 of them previously <b>unknown</b> in <b>palm</b> wine. From these, a total of 13 compounds were quantified by means of stable isotope dilution assays. Quantitation and calculation of the odour-activity values (OAVs) of the 13 key odorants revealed that the earthy-smelling 3 -isobutyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine, the buttery-smelling acetoin, the fruity compounds ethyl hexanoate, 3 -methylbutyl acetate and the popcorn-like-smelling 2 -acetyl- 1 -pyrroline {{are likely to be}} important odorants of palm wine, with 3 -isobutyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine, acetoin, and 2 -acetyl- 1 -pyrroline being reported {{here for the first time}} as aroma constituents of palm wine...|$|R

50|$|While {{clearing}} out Keith's things, Lee turns up and Sydney discovers that Lee was a strigoi, {{but he was}} turned back by a spirit user. This means that he ages slower and {{may be unable to}} access his magic. Lee also wishes to be turned back into a strigoi, but is unable to and he's the reason for all of the <b>unknown</b> deaths in <b>Palm</b> Springs including that of his cousin. Adrian show up at Keith's house, but both he and Sydney are restrained and Lee called his strigoi friends using Sydney and Adrian as a bargain for being re-awakened. Once the strigoi turn up and try to change Lee into one of them he instead dies then Sydney, Adrian, and the two strigoi get into a fight. One strigoi goes to drink Sydney's blood, but cannot as it is too vile and tastes horrible, but as they feed on Adrian. Sydney uses a fire charm that she created on a whim of her history teacher Mrs.Terwilliger to distract the strigoi. Just then, Eddie and Jill show up {{and with the help of}} Jill's water magic Eddie kills both strigoi.|$|R
40|$|Somaclonal {{variation}} {{arises in}} {{plants and animals}} when differentiated somatic cells are induced into a pluripotent state, but the resulting clones differ {{from each other and}} from their parents. In agriculture, somaclonal variation has hindered the micropropagation of elite hybrids and genetically modified crops, but the mechanism responsible remains <b>unknown.</b> The oil <b>palm</b> fruit 'mantled' abnormality is a somaclonal variant arising from tissue culture that drastically reduces yield, and has largely halted efforts to clone elite hybrids for oil production. Widely regarded as an epigenetic phenomenon, 'mantling' has defied explanation, but here we identify the MANTLED locus using epigenome-wide association studies of the African oil palm Elaeis guineensis. DNA hypomethylation of a LINE retrotransposon related to rice Karma, in the intron of the homeotic gene DEFICIENS, is common to all mantled clones and is associated with alternative splicing and premature termination. Dense methylation near the Karma splice site (termed the Good Karma epiallele) predicts normal fruit set, whereas hypomethylation (the Bad Karma epiallele) predicts homeotic transformation, parthenocarpy and marked loss of yield. Loss of Karma methylation and of small RNA in tissue culture contributes to the origin of mantled, while restoration in spontaneous revertants accounts for non-Mendelian inheritance. The ability to predict and cull mantling at the plantlet stage will facilitate the introduction of higher performing clones and optimize environmentally sensitive land resources...|$|R
5000|$|The {{producers}} {{conducted a}} long {{search for the}} actor to play the title role: over 400 actors auditioned for the part, and at one time, Dick Shawn {{was reported to be}} their preferred choice. However, the producers eventually chose <b>unknown</b> singer Peter <b>Palmer,</b> who had been serving in an army entertainment unit; Panama and Frank saw him perform on a segment of The Ed Sullivan Show featuring talented American soldiers. Palmer was a trained singer with a music degree from the University of Illinois, where he had also played football; at 6'4" [...] and 228 pounds, Palmer had the right [...] "look" [...] to play Li'l Abner. The leading female role, Daisy Mae, was relatively easier to cast. The producers knew that they wanted soprano Edie Adams, who had given a star-making performance as Eileen in the 1953 musical Wonderful Town. Adams, however, had also been offered the lead role in the original production of Candide. Adams asked director George Abbott, who had directed her in Wonderful Town, which show she should choose, and he advised her to take Daisy Mae, which she subsequently did. Coincidentally, Al Capp {{had been one of the}} three judges for the [...] "Miss U.S. Television" [...] contest broadcast on the DuMont Television Network in 1950 that first brought Adams national attention.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate {{aldolase}} (FBAld) is {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes the cleavage of D-fructose- 1, 6 -phosphate (FBP) to D-glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate (G 3 P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), and plays {{vital role in}} glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. However, molecular characterization and functional roles of FBAld remain <b>unknown</b> in sago <b>palm.</b> Here we report a modified CTAB-RNA extraction method was developed for the isolation of good quality RNA (RIN> 8) from sago leaves and the isolation of FBAld cDNA from sago palm. The isolated sago FBAld (msFBAld) cDNA has total length of 1288 bp with an open reading frame of 1020 bp and a predicted to encode for a protein of 340 amino acid resides. The predicted protein shared {{a high degree of}} homology with Class-I FBAld from other plants. Meanwhile, the msFBAld gene spanned 2322 bp and consisted of five exons. Conserved domain search identified fifteen catalytically important amino acids at the active site and phylogenetic tree revealed localization of msFBAld in the chloroplast. A molecular 3 D-structure of msFBAld was generated by homology modeling and a Ramachandran plot with 86. 7 % of the residues in the core region, 13. 4 % in the allowed region with no residues in the disallowed region. The modeled structure is a homotetramer containing an (/(-TIM-barrel at the center. Superimposition of the model with Class-I aldolases identified a catalytic dyad, Lys 209 -Glu 167, which could be involved in the Schiff's base formation and aldol condensation. Apart from that, overproduction of the recombinant msFBAld in Escherichia coli resulted in increased tolerance towards salinity...|$|R
