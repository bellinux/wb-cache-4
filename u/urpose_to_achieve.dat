Many organizations start to outsource information technology in order <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> benefits such as cost reduction, improve quality of service, {{and focus on the}} core competence.

5000|$|The {{choice of}} {{shooting}} format affects {{how easy it}} would be <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a deep focus look. This is because {{the size of the}} sensor or film gauge dictates what particular lens focal length would be used in order <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a desired viewing angle. Smaller sensors or film gauges will require an overall range of shorter focal lengths <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> any desired viewing angle than larger sensors or film gauges. Because depth of field is a characteristic of lens focal length (in addition to aperture and focus distance setting), it is easier <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a deep-focus look with a smaller imaging sensor or film gauge. For example: a 40mm lens will give a 30-degree horizontal angle of view in the Super35 format. <b>To</b> <b>achieve</b> the same viewing angle with a 1/2" [...] 16:9 sensor, you would need a 13mm lens. A 13mm lens inherently has much more depth-of-field than a 40mm lens. <b>To</b> <b>achieve</b> the same depth of field with a 40mm lens would require a very small aperture, which in turn would require far more light, and therefore time and expense.|$|R
