5000|$|The {{successor}} to IPv4 is IPv6. IPv6 {{was a result}} of several years of experimentation and dialog during which various protocol models were proposed, such as TP/IX (RFC 1475), PIP (RFC 1621) and TUBA (TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses, RFC 1347). Its most prominent difference from version 4 is the size of the addresses. While IPv4 uses 32 bits for addressing, yielding c. 4.3 billion (...) addresses, IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses providing ca. 340 <b>undecillion,</b> or [...] addresses. Although adoption of IPv6 has been slow, , all United States government systems have demonstrated basic infrastructure support for IPv6.|$|E
5000|$|A version 4 UUID is {{randomly}} generated. As {{in other}} UUIDs, four bits {{are used to}} indicate version 4, and 2 or 3 bits to indicate the variant ( [...] or [...] for variants 1 and 2, respectively). Thus, for variant 1 (that is, most UUIDs) a random version 4 UUID will have 6 predetermined variant and version bits, leaving 122 bits for the randomly-generated part, {{for a total of}} 2122, or 5.3x1036 (5.3 <b>undecillion)</b> possible version 4 variant 1 UUIDs. There are half as many possible version 4 variant 2 UUIDs (legacy GUIDs) because there is one less random bit available, 3 bits being consumed for the variant.|$|E
5000|$|The numbers {{past one}} {{trillion}} {{in the short}} scale system, in ascending powers of 1000, are as follows: quadrillion, quintillion, sextillion, septillion, octillion, nonillion, decillion, <b>undecillion,</b> duodecillion, tredecillion, quattuordecillion, quindecillion, sexdecillion, septendecillion, octodecillion, novemdecillion and vigintillion (which is 10 to the 63rd power, or a one followed by 63 zeros). The highest number in this series listed in modern dictionaries is centillion, which is 10 to the 303rd power. [...] The interim powers of one thousand between vigintillion and centillion do not have standardized names, nor do any higher powers, {{but there are many}} ad hoc extensions in use. The highest number listed in Robert Munafo's table of such unofficial names is milli-millillion, which was coined as a name for 10 to the 3,000,003rd power.|$|E
30|$|First, it {{is obvious}} that with such a large address space (3.4 [*]Ã—[*] 1038 or 340 <b>undecillion</b> addresses) a {{significant}} number of characters will be required to represent any single address. A full IPv 6 address consists of 32 bytes or a string of 39 characters (including 7 delimiters) in human readable form which is both challenging to remember and prone to mistakes when read, written or deployed. A longer notation means more buffer space is needed when saving, there is an increased cost in bandwidth and latency time during transit, and more computing power is used when reading/writing, searching/parsing, etc.|$|E
