40|$|Abstract. Today a {{main focus}} in high {{efficiency}} power electronics based on silicon carbide (SiC) {{lies on the}} development of an unipolar SiC switch. This paper comments on the advantages of SiC switching devices in comparison to silicon (Si) switches, the decision for the SiC JFET against the SiC MOSFET, and will show new experimental results on SiC JFETs with focus on the production related topics like process window and parameter homogeneity which can be achieved with the presented device concept. Due to material properties unipolar SiC switches have, other than their Si high voltage counterparts, very low gate charge, good body diode performance, and reduced switching losses because of the potential of lower in- and output capacitances. The most common <b>unipolar</b> <b>switch</b> is the MOSFET. However, the big challenge {{in the case of a}} SiC MOSFET is the gate oxide. A gate oxide on SiC that provides adequate performance and reliability is missing until now. An alternative unipolar switching device is a normally-on JFET. The normally-on behavior is a benefit for current driven applications. If a normally-off behavior is necessary the JFET can be used together with a low voltage Si MOSFET in a cascode arrangement. Recently manufactured SiC JFETs show results in very good accordance to device simulation and demonstrate the possibility to fabricate a SiC JFET within a mass production. A growing market opportunity for such a SiC switch becomes visible...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis addresses "hot" electron diodes, otherwise known as Bulk Unipolar Diodes (BUD's), which require the formation of narrow, highly doped layers in a semiconductor with abrupt transitions from one doping level to another. A review of the properties of this family of devices is undertaken and since a BUD is formed by a narrow plane of ionised impurities within a semiconductor, analysis show {{that it is possible}} to control the in-built barrier electrostatically via a gate located in the vicinity of the barrier region (p-plane region). A study of the role of injected minority carriers has been applied in two areas, deployed in the two-state switch and the photodetector applications. An investigation of the switching characteristics of the Bulk <b>Unipolar</b> <b>Switch</b> (BUS) and various device design parameters using an empirical formula, is presented for Computer-Aided-Design (CAD). The model has been shown to simulate all the critical points on the I/V characteristic and the reconstruction is in good agreement with published results. The p-plane BUD structure is analysed in detail and the results from numerical methods are given for the device by modifying various design parameters. Objective assessment has lead to the development of a novel p-plane photodetector where the internal gain is due to optical modulation of the potential barrier inside the bulk material via the diffusion and thermionic emission theories for the first time. Qualitative analysis of how optically generated holes in the vicinity of the p t-plane have the effect of lowering the height of the potential barrier, are presented. Results from analysis show the dependence of the high gain on the modulation of the barrier...|$|E

40|$|An {{inverter}} {{is essential}} for the interfacing of photovoltaic panels with the AC network. There are many possible inverter topologies and inverter switching schemes and each one will have its own relative advantages and disadvantages. Efficiency and output current distortion are two important factors governing the choice of inverter system. In this paper, it is argued that current controlled inverters offer significant advantages {{from the point of view}} of minimisation of current distortion. Two inverter switching strategies are explored in detail. These are the unipolar current controlled inverter and the bipolar current controlled inverter. With respect to low frequency distortion, previously published works provide theoretical arguments in favour of bipolar switching. On the other hand it has also been argued that the <b>unipolar</b> <b>switched</b> inverter offers reduced switching losses and generates less EMI. On efficiency grounds, it appears that the <b>unipolar</b> <b>switched</b> inverter has an advantage.

40|$|There is {{currently}} significant {{growth in the}} number of residential scale grid connected photovoltaic (PV) systems. Generally, if environmental costs are not accounted for, the cost of generation from PV sources remains high compared to conventionally generated electricity. There is, therefore, a strong incentive to reduce the cost of PV systems and improve their efficiency while satisfying injected power quality standards. The focus has been on the power electronic single phase converter bridge which is typically used as interface between the DC output of the PV panels and the terminals of the AC network. One of the two main objectives was to investigate the possibility of operating an inverter connected to the AC grid without an interfacing power transformer, while keeping DC injection into the grid below levels specified by Australian and International Standards. A low cost method of controlling the DC offset content of the current injected into the AC mains has been proposed. A mathematical model of the DC offset controller has been developed and experimentally validated. A design procedure for the controller has also been developed. The second objective was to investigate the dependence of efficiency on inverter switching strategies such as bipolar and <b>unipolar</b> <b>switching.</b> It was confirmed by specially designed tests that <b>unipolar</b> <b>switching</b> meant significantly lower switching losses when compared with bipolar switching. However, the quality of current injected into the AC mains in the case of <b>unipolar</b> <b>switching</b> was not considered acceptable because of significant current distortion near the AC mains voltage zero crossing. A new method of inverter switching has been proposed which exploits the efficiency advantage of <b>unipolar</b> <b>switching</b> while avoiding the problem of current distortion. The main outcomes of this project are a DC offset controller which allow transformerless operation and an inverter switching strategy that results in significantly reduced switching losses while maintaining the quality of injected current. Implementation of the proposed DC offset controller and inverter switching strategy will result in both capital cost savings and higher conversion efficiency...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT — A hybrid {{pulse width}} modulation(PWM) scheme that {{combines}} {{the advantages of}} <b>unipolar</b> <b>switching</b> scheme (USS) and bipolar switching scheme (BSS) for a grid-connected current source inverter is presented. The former switching scheme {{has the advantage of}} low switching loss while the latter one has the advantage of less total harmonic distortion(THD). The inverter bridge is predominantly operated under USS over a line cycle, within which only one switch is switched at high frequency. It is momentarily operated in BSS around the zero-crossing region of the line voltage, within which two switches are switched at high frequency. To further reduce the switching loss, the concept of passive resonant snubber is applied to the high-frequency switches in the inverter. The circuit is simulated using MATLAB simu-link. The proposed control scheme is also to be implemented for a 60 V, 50 Hz, 360 W inverter.

30|$|The {{stochastic}} switching in {{this research}} was investigated only under <b>unipolar</b> <b>switching</b> mode. Thus, the active core of our prototypes only undergoes a reduction from TiO 2 to TiO 2 -x, after employing a number of pulses that induce a cumulative thermally driven mechanism [12, 13]. In contrast to the bipolar switching model where resistive switching is attained via displacement of ionic species (a well-controlled stable process), <b>unipolar</b> <b>switching</b> is mainly ascribed to a thermally driven reduction of TiO 2, which may cause inconsistent switching [14]. As a result, the activation energy supplied by a single set pulse {{is not sufficient to}} generate formation and rupture of continuous filaments. Resistive switching events are thus not available at each programming pulse, as demonstrated in Figure  1 c,d. The aim of pulse-induced measurement in this manuscript is to supply well-controlled identical activation energies to the thermally driven filamentary formation and rupture procedure [14], which makes it possible to only investigate the influence of initial filament distribution on stochastic switching.|$|R

40|$|DoctorElectrically {{bistable}} devices using organic thin film were first {{reported in the}} 1970 s but didn’t attract much attention. In the last decade nonvolatile memory devices based on {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) processes have rapidly scaled down transistor size to lower process costs and increase chip density. However, nonvolatile memory devices are now facing the limitations of scaling down of silicon devices. Accordingly, advanced memory technologies are required. Nonvolatile memory technology using polymer materials has again attracted attention to overcome the limitations of scaling down of silicon devices. This technology has the advantages of good scalability, mechanical flexibility and ease of processing. Therefore, polymer materials are being actively researched as nonvolatile memory, and polymer memory devices have been reported using various materials. Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :Poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) thin films have been widely used in research on write-once-read-many-times (WORM) memory, organic transistors, organic light emitting diodes (OLED), and solar cells. We have fabricated polymer memory devices using PEDOT:PSS thin film with various electrodes and have measured current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of those devices. The devices had bipolar and <b>unipolar</b> <b>switching</b> behavior, depending on what electrode was used or what operation method was used. The devices using Al, Ti and Au BE basically didn’t have any switching behavior. If a compliance current (CC) was used in the write operation method, the Al/PEDOT:PSS/TEs devices had <b>unipolar</b> <b>switching</b> behavior and the Au/PEDOT:PSS/Al devices had bipolar switching behavior. The ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TE devices had only bipolar switching behavior. Clearly, the electrode material and the write operation method have important roles in the switching behavior and characteristics. Each switching mechanism can basically be explained as the formation of current paths due to redox behavior of PEDOT:PSS film. When a voltage is applied to the electrode, the PEDOT chains will be oxidized to PEDOT+ chains by the injected carriers. Then current paths will be formed by PEDOT+ chains and the devices will switch from the off state to the on state. However, the two types of devices have different on-off switching processes. In the bipolar switching devices, the PEDOT+ chains are reduced to PEDOT 0 chains by injection carriers when a voltage is scanned in the opposite direction. Then the current paths are destroyed and the devices switch from the on state to the off state. In the <b>unipolar</b> <b>switching</b> devices, the current flowing through the current path in the devices is increased beyond the CC when a voltage is applied with a maximum CC. Then the current paths are ruptured by the very large turn-off current and the devices switch from the on state to the off state. Finally, we have fabricated diode-memory devices for 3 D multi-layer and crossbar array applications. The devices were fabricated by incorporating ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ P 3 HT:PCBM/Al polymer diode devices in series with unipolar Al/PEDOT:PSS/Al memory devices.

30|$|Resistive {{random access}} memory (ReRAM) {{is one of the}} most {{significantly}} nonvolatile memories because of its fast switching speed, low power consumption, excellent endurance, and easy integration with current device processes [1, 2]. Among the materials for ReRAM application, metal oxides have attracted an increasing interest in material choice because of controllable compositions. Therefore, making a high-quality metal oxide layer with a bistable resistance state is a key issue in achieving a high-performance ReRAM device. A typical configuration of the ReRAM device usually consists of metal/insulator/metal structures, and the operation is based on the switching of high resistance state (HRS) and low resistance state (LRS) (off and on states) after a larger bias was applied due to the formation of a conductive bridge/path [3]. In general, the switching behaviors can be classified into two types in terms of current–voltage (I V) behaviors, namely bipolar and <b>unipolar</b> <b>switching</b> [4, 5].

A reset potential of + 2  V switched the device from low resistive state (LRS) to high resistive state (HRS), while an opposite switching trend occurred at + 4  V in the following programming cycle. In this study, the stochastic resistive switching phenomenon was investigated only under <b>unipolar</b> <b>switching</b> mode via a voltage pulsing and evaluation scheme illustrated in Figure  1 e. For each cycle, a 4 -V pulse with 10 -μs width was applied to switch the devices; the resistive state value was then evaluated by a pulse of 0.5  V and 1  μs, which does not disturb the intrinsic resistive state. Intriguingly, though biased with the same pulse-induced scheme, distinct switching trends were observed for two identical TiO 2 -based ReRAM cells with similar initial resistance (both RINI[*]=[*] 8 MΩ), as demonstrated in Figure  1 c,d. Specifically, device A required less programming cycles {{in the first two}} switching events to toggle between HRS and LRS; it switched at the 5 th cycle and switched back at the 8 th cycle, while for device B, similar switching events occurred at the 10 th and the 30 th cycles, respectively.
