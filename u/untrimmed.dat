40|$|We {{used the}} <b>UnTRIM</b> San Francisco Bay–Delta {{hydrodynamic}} model {{to examine the}} spatial distribution of salinity {{as a function of}} freshwater flow in the San Francisco Estuary. Our particular focus was the covariation of flow with the spatial extent of the low-salinity zone (LSZ: salinity = 0. 5 to 6), and with the extent of habitat for common species of -nekton as defined by their salinity ranges. The <b>UnTRIM</b> model has an unstructured grid which allowed us to refine earlier estimates of the availability of suitable salinity ranges, particularly for species resident in low salinity. The response of the salinity field to flow was influenced by the bathymetry of the estuary. Area and volume of the LSZ were bimodal with X 2, the distance up the axis of the estuary to a near-bottom salinity of 2, roughly the middle of the LSZ. The smallest area and volume occurred when the LSZ was in the Delta or Carquinez Strait, moderate values when it was in Suisun Bay, and the highest values when it was in broad, shallow San Pablo Bay. Resource selection functions for the distributions of common nekton species in salinity space were up-dated from previous values and used to calculate salinity-based habitat indices using the <b>UnTRIM</b> results. These indices generally increased with decreasing X 2 (increasing flow), but the slopes of these relationships were mostly inconsistent with corresponding relationships of abundance to flow. Thus, although the salinity range used by most nekton expands as flow increases, other mechanisms relating population size to flow are likely more important than the physical extent of suitable salinity. ...|$|R
40|$|Circulation in Clifton Court Forebay (CCF) was {{simulated}} {{using the}} three-dimensional (3 –D) hydrodynamic model <b>UnTRIM.</b> These numerical simulations {{were performed to}} provide {{a better understanding of}} circulation patterns, flow pathways, and residence time in Clifton Court Forebay in support of ongoing studies of pre-screen loss and fish facility efficiency for delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) at the California State Water Project (SWP) export facilities. The 3 –D hydrodynamic model of CCF was validated through comparisons to observed water surface elevations inside CCF, and comparisons to observed drifter paths and velocity measurements collected by the U. S. Geological Survey as part of this study. Flow measurements collected near the radial gates for 2 days during relatively low inflows suggest that the Hills (1988) gate equations may over-estimate inflow by as much as 39 % when the CCF radial gates are only partially opened. Several alternative approaches to improve the implementation of the radial gate flows in the <b>UnTRIM</b> model were evaluated. The resulting model accurately predicts water surface elevations and currents inside CCF over a range of wind and operating conditions. The validated model was used to predict residence time and other transport time scales for two 21 -day simulation periods, one of very low daily SWP export pumping averaging 19. 3 m 3 s- 1 and one for moderate daily SWP export pumping averaging 66. 6 m 3 s- 1. The average transit time, indicating the time from entering CCF to reaching the fish facility, was estimated as 9. 1 days for low export conditions and 4. 3 days for moderate export conditions.   These transport time scale estimates may be used to inform estimates of pre-screen losses inside CCF due to predation or other causes...|$|R

40|$|Our {{long-term}} {{goal is to}} employ numerical simulation to generate accurate predictions of nonhydrostatic internal-tide events, such as large internal waves and solitons, in the ocean. OBJECTIVES Our primary objective is to modify and extend an existing field-scale, nonhydrostatic, unstructured-grid code so we may simulate internal waves in three dimensions and time. Our applications objective is to validate the code in Monterey Bay {{and apply it to}} the internal wave field in the South China Sea.

40|$|The Ems estuary has {{constantly}} {{changed over}} the past centuries both from man-made and natural influences. On the time scale of thousands of years, sea level rise has created the estuary and dynamically changed its boundaries. More recently, storm surges created the Dollard sub-basin in the 14 th - 15 th centuries. Beginning in the 16 th century, diking and reclamation of land has greatly altered the surface area of the Ems estuary, particularly in the Dollard. These natural and anthropogenic changes to the surface area of the Ems altered the flow patterns of water, the tidal characteristics, and the patterns of sediment deposition and erosion. Since 1945, reclamation of land has halted and {{the borders of the}} Ems estuary have changed little. Sea level rise has continued, and over the past 40 years the rate of increase in mean high water (MHW) along the German coast has accelerated to 40 cm/ century. Climate has varied on a decadal time scale due to long-term variations in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which controls precipitation, temperature, and the direction and magnitude of winds. Between 1960 and 1990 the most intense variation in the NAO index on record was observed. As a result the magnitude and frequency of storm surges increased, and mean wave heights increased at 1 - 2 cm/year. Currently the NAO index—and therefore storminess—is trending downwards. Over the longer term, global warming models predict an average temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius over the next century. A doubling of CO 2 is expected to increase sea level by 30 cm, while the significant wind speed and wave heights in the North Sea are predicted to increase by 50 cm/s and 50 cm, respectively. Beginning in the late 1950 ’s, dredging activity and construction measures in harbours and shipping channels greatly altered the physical processes in the Ems. Deepening and streamlining the Ems River and shipping channel between the 1960 s and 1990 s decreased the hydraulic roughness and increased the tidal range in the river above Emden by as much as 1. 5 m. At the turbidity maximum between Emden and Papenburg, concentrations of sediment are currently between 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger than in the 1950 ’s, and fluid mud layers of several meters thickness occur. Other man-made changes, such as gas pipelines and the expansion of harbours, have often caused significant, but more localized, changes to the estuary. Between the mid 19 th century and the 1970 ’s, dumping of organic waste—agricultural, industrial, and human—severely stressed the ecology of the Dollard sub-basin in particular. Since then the input of organic waste has been greatly reduced and anoxic conditions eliminated. However, the increase in turbidity at the turbidity maximum has caused depleted oxygen concentrations and periodic anoxia between Pogum and Papenburg during the summer months (personal communication, H. Juergens; Talke et al, 2005). The Ems is a relatively well studied estuary. Significant research projects have included the BOEDE project in the 1970 ’s [...] 1980 ’s and the BOA and INTRAMUD projects in the 1990 ’s. These projects and other efforts have amassed a deep literature in the knowledge of tidal flats, fluid mud and flocculation, and mixing and dispersion processes. Projects currently underway are focusing on tidal dynamics and the affects of dredging in the high turbidity zone between Emden and Herbrum. Optimal management of the estuary is the goal of the HARBASINS project. Many analytical and numerical models have been applied to the Ems estuary to estimate tidal range, storm surges, wave fields, sediment transport, and mixing and dispersion processes. Analytical models to estimate mixing of scalars and sediment fluxes (Sediment Trend Analysis) have been extensively used. Numerical models such as WAQUA, <b>unTRIM,</b> MIKE 3, Telemac 2 D, SWAN, Delft 3 D –Sed, and others have been applied to the Ems. While reasonable results are found for short term processes (order of days), long-term morphological change cannot yet be predicted. For the Ems catchement basin, the numerical models REGFLUD and FLUMAGIS are used to estimate nutrient inputs from diffuse sources and to visualize and evaluate the effects of land-use change...|$|R

Maria Volkonskaya, {{the wife of the}} Decembrist leader Sergei Volkonsky, notably followed her husband to his exile in Irkutsk. Despite the spartan conditions of this banishment, Sergei Volkonsky and his wife, Maria, took opportunities to celebrate the liberalising mode of their exile. Sergei took to wearing an <b>untrimmed</b> beard (rejecting Peter the Great's reforms and salon fashion), wearing peasant dress and socialising with many of his peasant associates with whom he worked the land at his farm in Urik. Maria, equally, established schools, a foundling hospital and a theater for the local population. Sergei returned after thirty years of his exile had elapsed, though his titles and land remained under royal possession. Other exiles preferred to remain in Siberia after their sentences were served, preferring its relative freedom to the stifling intrigues of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and after years of exile there was not much for them to return to. Many Decembrists thrived in exile, in time becoming landowners and farmers. In later years, they would become idols of the populist movement of the 1860s and the 1870s, as the Decembrists' advocacy of reform (including the abolition of serfdom) won them many admirers, the writer Leo Tolstoy among them.|$|E
