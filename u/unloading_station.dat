500|$|On July 20, 2012, a 48-year-old {{woman from}} Pitt County, North Carolina, was found unresponsive on Dominator after its train {{returned}} to the ride's <b>unloading</b> <b>station.</b> An incident report described {{that she had a}} [...] "seizure-like episode" [...] after riding the roller coaster. The woman was taken to a hospital, where she died. Autopsy results revealed that she had a brain aneurysm. A Hanover County, Virginia, inspector found no operational problems with Dominator. The ride reopened on July 23, 2012, after it passed two safety inspections.|$|E
500|$|When {{the riders}} have boarded, {{the vehicle is}} dispatched. It travels around an indoor Antarctic environment, {{spinning}} to view a variety of scenery and projection screens. The story {{which began in the}} pre-show continues, with Puck venturing out into the sea. When he is underwater, Puck is chased by a leopard seal before resurfacing on land. The ride's theme song [...] "Antarctica: One World, One Family" [...] by Lauren Alaina is then played as guests watch a live penguin habitat behind glass before the vehicles return to a four-platform <b>unloading</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{standard}} gauge railway tunnel, codenamed Ida, {{was to be}} built on a curving path that would connect it with both the east- and west-bound main line railway, allowing trains to run straight through the complex without needing to reverse or be turned around. This would serve as the main <b>unloading</b> <b>station,</b> where missiles and supplies would be offloaded onto trolleys that would transport them into the connecting galleries Mathilde and Hugo. Hugo connected in turn with Sophie, a dead-end railway tunnel branching from the main line into Ida. Each of the main tunnels {{had a number of}} unnamed side tunnels of the same dimensions as the main tunnels and up to [...] long. The central feature of the complex was a huge octagonal rocket-preparation chamber directly under the dome. It was never completed but would have been [...] in diameter and up to [...] high. A number of intermediate floors, possibly as many as ten, would have been built up the sides of the chamber.|$|E
50|$|Coal is transported between Yuejing and Shixi by {{electric}} locomotives. One ZL 14-7 {{goes forward}} and backwards between the loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the ride, guests would {{disembark}} {{their boats}} onto the <b>unload</b> <b>station</b> before {{going up and}} over a bridge {{to get off the}} island station. Once back at ground level, guests were able to purchase on-ride photos taken during the final drop of the ride.|$|R

500|$|While {{the train}} is being loaded with passengers, the catch car for the cable lift descends the lift hill and latches onto the middle car {{underneath}} the train. Once {{the train is}} cleared, the cable lift immediately pulls the train up the 45 degree lift hill at [...] to a height of [...] The train drops [...] at an 80 degree angle and reaches {{a top speed of}} [...] {{at the bottom of the}} hill. It then climbs [...] through a right overbanked turn at 122 degrees from the horizontal axis, then travels through a tunnel as it passes over the Frontier Trail. It then travels over a [...] parabolic hill, which provides a moment of [...] zero gravity as it passes over a lagoon and down onto Adventure Island. While on Adventure Island, the train passes by the Dinosaurs Alive! attraction several times. It completes a , 360-degree right-handed helix, followed by a left overbanked turn, passing the Shoot the Rapids water ride. It then completes a small right-hand turn before traveling over another hill to leave the island. The train then travels left through a second tunnel where the on-ride photo is taken, followed by a left turn and a small hill, passing by the queue. Finally, the train travels [...] high through another right overbanked turn over the queue and is stopped by magnetic brakes. Passengers disembark the ride at an <b>unloading</b> <b>station</b> and the train moves to a second station where it is loaded.|$|E
500|$|The ride {{experience}} was different in its earlier years. Passengers would enter under {{the middle of}} the coaster's lift. After entering an eerie space soundtrack played. The first room was [...] "Mission Control". Black lights lit the room. Travel posters and a rocket diagram were on the side walls. Two airport loading gates were seen next to two TV monitors (showing the head of the company [...] "The Dispatch Master" [...] or random space pilots) and were on either side of a desk in the middle. An employee sitting at the desk would say to the riders that the loading gates on were both malfunctioning and the riders had to be rerouted through the [...] "service rooms" [...] of the hangar. Walking into the next room deemed [...] "Rocket Recovery", guests would see a [...] "rocket locator" [...] robot named [...] "Dave" [...] working up on a platform at a terminal trying to contact the companies rockets (one according to him crashed outside of Akron). Walking down another hallway, guests could glance at crates inside of a warehouse within the building. After the short hallway, guests entered the [...] "Repair Bay". A room showcasing a [...] "binocular security camera" [...] robot named [...] "Franc" [...] looking around the room (he was later removed). There were also suspended conveyor baskets carrying various items, a high voltage generator, pneumatic robotic arms [...] "repairing" [...] a rocket, and a security scanner that flashed [...] "REJECT" [...] after scanning guests.A small room outside the Repair Bay had the company's logo subtlety broken to reveal the ride's true name. Entering the [...] "Launch Area" [...] rockets moved from behind a curtain without passengers. After ten people loaded on a rocket the ride began. The rocket moved out on a block section where an [...] "on-board computer" [...] welcomed you and started the [...] "automatic launch sequence". Two spinning laser light spheres projected a star field around the rocket as it climbed the lift. Upon reaching the top your computer takes notice of nearby [...] "space pirates" [...] and begins to perform abrasive maneuvers. As riders went through the coaster, they would see exploding rockets, meteors, laser projections, and a satellite that shot lasers. Your on-board computer shouts [...] "I'm losing control, I'm losing control!" [...] before an Alaskan landscape came into view and the rockets entered the brake run. Riders entered the <b>unloading</b> <b>station</b> where they were greeted by an employee that yells [...] "WELCOME TO ALASKA!" [...] The riders disembarked their vehicle and exited on the left.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the ride}} is complete, riders {{dismount}} the Evac vehicle at the <b>unload</b> <b>station.</b> Upon exiting the ride, guests are greeted with the Transformers Supply Vault gift store, which sells items from the Transformers film franchise, Transformers: The Ride merchandise {{and a variety of}} Transformers toys.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} loading, <b>unloading</b> train <b>stations</b> and interstations.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the load}} and <b>unload</b> <b>station</b> riders must mount and {{dismount}} the boat {{while it is}} moving at a slow speed along a conveyor belt. The conveyor belt can be stopped for those who need assistance in boarding. Guests are loaded into one of several 8-person boats which seat pairs of riders across 4 rows.|$|R
50|$|The {{discharge}} process {{is powered by}} the locomotive, which pulls the unbroken train set through the <b>unloading</b> <b>station.</b> The Helix Dumper <b>unloading</b> <b>station</b> has no moving or motorised parts and requires no additional power supply.|$|E
5000|$|At the <b>unloading</b> <b>station,</b> {{the train}} unloads the coal and {{conveyor}} belts transport {{it to the}} three stacker-reclaimers, which unload it to storage piles. It is later reclaimed {{and sent to the}} linear ship-loader, which places it in the holds of coal ships.|$|E
50|$|The coal {{handling}} {{system of the}} power plant has a truck <b>unloading</b> <b>station</b> capacity of 600 tonnes/hour and its flexible sidewall conveyor capacity of 800 tonnes/hour. The coal is stored in coal domes in which each dome is 120 meter in diameter, 60 meter in height and 180,000 tons in capacity.|$|E
25|$|Jet Rescue {{features}} two trains {{which each}} feature eight cars. Each car seats {{a pair of}} riders who are restrained {{by the use of}} a lap bar. The ride vehicles are modelled after jet skis to match the theme of the ride. Transfer track is located adjacent to the <b>unload</b> <b>station</b> allowing Sea World to operate the ride with one or two trains.|$|R

50|$|At Warner Bros. Movie World in Australia, many {{elements}} of the ride still exist to this day. The original facade for the attraction exists behind Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster's Spooky Island castle facade. Two of the theatres {{that were used in}} the pre-show exist adjacent to the replacement ride's queue. Finally, the <b>unload</b> <b>station</b> still exists (albeit with theming removed) and is used as an evacuation path from the Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster.|$|R
50|$|The ride {{starts with}} a spiral lift. Once {{at the top of}} the lift, the vehicle descends a hill, then takes a left turn, another right turn, and another smaller drop. The ride then goes into a series of drops, and turns before hitting the final brake run and {{stopping}} at an <b>unloading</b> <b>station.</b> After unloading, the vehicles return to the loading station.|$|E

This small butte overlooks the Rocky Mountain SuperChair and is accessible by hiking from the Vista Haus along a short dirt road in the summer.|$|E
40|$|A {{mass transit}} system {{for use in}} moving a load {{carrying}} vehicle along a predetermined route between a number of load handling stations. The mass transportation system includes an unobstructed tube transport means located along the predetermined route. A vehicle provided with antifriction support is conveyed through the tube transport means by the momentum of driving air provided {{by one or more}} pumping devices which extracts a fraction of the air flow and substantially immediately reintroduces the air into the tube to create or restore the necessary air momentum. The tube may be continuous or non-continuous and is characterized by uniform cross section {{and the fact that it}} provides the support for the vehicle. The vehicle is shaped in cross section so as to substantially fill the cross section of the tube but not completely, so as to allow driving air to flow continuously within the tube even though the vehicle may be traveling at a speed substantially less than the mean velocity of the driving air, as on acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle. The vehicle body is also shaped to provide high drag characteristics so that it may travel within the tube at substantially the same velocity as the driving air. Loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>stations</b> are provided in the system in open communication with the ambient atmosphere, thereby allowing ease of loading and unloading. Each of the pumping devices used for delivering the driving air to the tube transport means is positioned between loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>stations</b> and is capable of producing a high mass rate of air flow at very low static pressure and the loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>stations</b> for the vehicle are positioned at points within the tube system where the static pressure is at or near atmospheric pressure.

500|$|The queue for {{the ride}} begins outside the Hall of Justice area. Inside the entrance, several {{portable}} television screens inform guests that an alien attack on the Earth is underway {{and that they are}} required to defeat the alien threat. Riders pass under a scanning device as they enter the Cyborg's test lab, which also serves as the load and <b>unload</b> <b>station.</b> Riders are provided with a pair of RealD 3D glasses before boarding their tactical assault vehicle and entering the battle.|$|R
25|$|The ride's queue begins {{alongside}} the <b>unload</b> <b>station</b> and continues in one long stretch towards the load station. When {{in line with}} the load station, the queue performs several switchbacks before allowing riders to line up alongside air gates to let them on the ride. On {{the far side of the}} load station several television monitors loop through a video explaining how to get on the ride. The video also details that the riders' mission is to rescue a trapped sea lion for the Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation.|$|R
5000|$|Coleson Cove {{opened in}} 1976 and was {{designed}} to burn #6 fuel oil, also known colloquially as [...] "bunker C".

40|$|Flexible {{manufacturing}} systems (FMS) are {{production systems}} consisting of identical multipurpose numerically controlled machines (workstations), automated material handling system, tools, load and <b>unload</b> <b>stations,</b> inspection stations, storage areas and a hierarchical control system. The latter has {{the task of}} coordinating and integrating all {{the components of the}} whole system for automatic operations. A particular characteristic of FMSs is their complexity along with the difficulties in building analytical models that capture the system in all its important aspects. Thus optimal control strategies, or at least good ones, are hard to find and the full potential of manufacturing systems is not completely exploited...|$|R

Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) are production systems consisting of identical multipurpose numerically controlled machines (workstations), automated material handling system, tools, load and <b>unload</b> <b>stations,</b> inspection stations, storage areas and a hierarchical control system. The model will prioritize the job and select the best alternative route with multi-criteria scheduling through an approach based on a fuzzy logic. There are three criteria for both the job sequencing and routing with 27 rules. With {{the help of the}} rules the sequence of the jobs are done and the best route is selected...|$|R
50|$|Wolf Mountain {{consists}} of a large beginner slope on the skiers left and several steeper and longer runs on the skiers right, with a terrain park cutting between the two. The short double chairlift Wolfdeedo Chair and the newly installed longer Wolf's Lair Triple Chair access the beginner slope and the Wolf's Lair Terrain Park. Howling Wolf Chair, a longer double chairlift with a midway <b>unloading</b> <b>station,</b> provides the only access {{to most of the}} resort's terrain as it runs up the center of the hill; it also accesses the beginner slope and terrain park. A short surface lift, the Magic Carpet, is also available for beginners.|$|E
50|$|The high {{capacity}} of the port and coal handling rate are achieved thanks to utilization of specialized equipment at each stage of the operation. The coal processing operation begins at the car <b>unloading</b> <b>station</b> equipped with two tandem rotary car dumpers, car thawing systems of a capacity of 80 gondola cars, a windshield with infrared car heating, drilling and ripping complex, conveyor equipment and frozen coal crushing / screening systems. Efficient storage is ensured by specialized equipment, consisting of four reclaimers, two stackers, bulldozers and loaders. The loading of the ships is performed by four ship loading machines (of capacity of 3,000 tonnes / hour) {{as well as other}} auxiliary machinery.|$|E
50|$|A Helix Dumper is a rail {{transport}} and unloading solution, designed for continuous rolling discharge of bulk commodities. Originally {{developed for the}} iron ore industry, the Helix Dumper system can handle many types of fine-grained and potentially sticky commodities.When the Helix Dumper wagon enters the unloading area, a wheel {{at the top of}} the wagon makes contact with the spiral-shaped rigid guide that constitutes the <b>unloading</b> <b>station.</b> As the wheel travels along the path of the guide, the wagon chassis remains on the rails while the body of the wagon is rotated 148 degrees to dump its load. After the rotation, the direction of the guide changes and the wagon body is returned to its normal position. The Helix Dumper has a discharge rate of up to 25,000 tonnes per hour.|$|E
50|$|A {{projection}} of Earth, stars, comets, meteors, and asteroids {{can be seen}} when looking past the lift hill bay's open ceiling. It is possible to make out trains climbing the lift hill {{on the other side}} and also rockets passing through on the side, as well as the Tomorrowland Transit Authority passing through the lift hill bay. Once at the top, space shuttles then make a small and quick dip before plunging into numerous twists and turns as the shuttles travel through the mountain in near-complete darkness, including the coaster's steepest drop of 39 degrees. The ride ends with the trains passing through a red swirling wormhole, before hitting the final brake run and entering the <b>unload</b> <b>station.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another train may pass by {{the riders}} {{climbing}} the lift hill. It {{is also possible}} to make out riders on the Tomorrowland Transit Authority passing through the lift hill bay, as well as riders on the other track climbing the lift hill. At the top, riders descend a short drop and then descend {{through a series of}} turns, sharp climbs, and steep drops {{in the darkness of the}} mountain.

5000|$|Blue Fire {{has five}} trains with five cars each. The trains {{accommodate}} two riders per row, {{for a total}} of 20 riders per train. [...] With a two-minute, 30-second ride and separate loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>stations,</b> 1,720 riders can ride Blue Fire per hour. [...] The trains use lap bar restraints rather than the over-the-shoulder restraints employed on Maverick and other Intamin Accelerator coasters, and stadium-style seating like that of Millennium Force. As opposed to more conventional lap bars found on most wooden roller coasters, the lap bar on a seat on Blue Fire is above the seat when the train is not occupied. However, the restraint itself rests in the rider's lap instead of across the rider's chest.|$|R
