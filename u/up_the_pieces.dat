Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they should take it out for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where the boat is docked. Andy starts to hoist the main sail, but is stopped by a broker who is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet. Walter comes to and tells Andy he wanted to get the first relapse out of the way before {{checking}} into rehab. Andy invites him on the trip, saying they both need family time together and leaves, thanking Erin for her encouragement. Erin says to the camera that she would have loved to go with him if he asked. Back in the office that evening, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) asks Erin to join him for drinks, and she accepts.|$|E

25|$|Their first album, Pickin' <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pieces</b> (1969), is {{considered}} a seminal album of the country rock genre. Reviewer Charley Walters awarded the release with 5 stars in the 1979 Rolling Stone Record Guide edited by Dave Marsh and John Swenson, although it was subsequently reduced to 4 stars in the 1983 revised and updated edition of the book. However, the album performed weakly, peaking at No.63 on Billboard album chart.|$|E
25|$|Gareth Southgate's 100th game in charge, {{which saw}} Stewart Downing named captain {{for the first}} time in Emanuel Pogatetz' absence was a {{frustrating}} one. They saw two chances cleared off the line by former Middlesbrough player James Morrison, a shot hit the bar, and a penalty shout turned down as they squandered plenty of chances to beat Tony Mowbray's West Bromwich Albion. Instead, they were left to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> after a 1–0 defeat courtesy of Jonas Olsson.|$|E

25|$|In 1997 From the Inside and A Good Feelin' to Know were reissued on CD by BGO, a British label.

The notes give {{a brief history of}} the band and the recording of each album.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Kees {{separated}} from his wife Ann, whose alcoholism led to a psychotic episode triggered by watching the Army–McCarthy hearings on television. After having her institutionalized, Kees divorced her around the time that his last book appeared, Poems, 1947–1954 (San Francisco, Adrian Wilson, 1954). He then focused on organizing a musical revue, Pick <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pieces,</b> which eventually became a much more elaborate venue of literary burlesque, titled Poets Follies, which premiered in January 1955 and featured a stripper reading the poetry of Sarah Teasdale (sic).|$|E

25|$|The 1977–78 season, however, {{proved to}} be one that the club would prefer to forget. From {{what seemed like a}} safe mid-table {{position}} in March, Blackpool won only one of their final sixteen games and were relegated to Division Three, by one point, {{for the first time in}} their 91-year history. Brown had been sacked in February, with the club in ninth place and having scored ten goals in their previous two home games, and it was left to Jimmy Meadows once more to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> for the remaining three months of the campaign.|$|E
25|$|Frank is a wheeler-dealer {{who likes}} to {{think of himself as}} a 'big player' in the {{business}} world, but in reality he {{is little more than a}} wily conman. He is a smooth-talker and full of charm, but his actions are often thoughtless and he tends to run instead of facing up to his responsibilities, leaving his loved ones to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces.</b> His love affair with Pat Harris (Pam St. Clement) stems back to his teens, and he can never quite let her go, always breaking her heart, disappearing, and returning to break it all over again.|$|E
25|$|Since {{very early}} on, the {{publishing}} duties and design duties {{had actually been}} split, with the Amarillo Design Bureau (ADB) handling all of the product design, while TFG had published, and indicated {{what they wanted to}} produce. The end of TFG put everything under one house again, and ADB, Inc. spent some time picking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> of nearly three years without SFB. The first order of business, in fact, was to reprint Basic Set and Advanced Missions which had been out of stock for about three years at this point. While they were at it, all the errata and questions were evaluated, and many sections of the rules were re-written {{in an effort to make}} the game clearer. These editions featured new cover colors and a '1999' legend at the bottom of the cover to show when they were printed.|$|E

While in a drug fueled haze, he calls Paro's husband {{in the middle of}} the night, she visits him at the cheap lodge where he is staying. She shows her love by taking care of him but spurns his {{attempts}} at physical intimacy. The meeting ends on a bitter note, and Paro returns to her married life. Dev resolves to go back to Chanda, but confronted by the reality of her profession, he abandons her, too. He resumes his destructive lifestyle of alcohol, drugs, and reckless behaviour. Months later, after his life has completely fallen apart and hit an all-time low, Dev attempts to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces.</b> He seeks Chanda once again and, with her help, sets out to start life afresh.|$|E

500|$|Thompson {{was living}} alone as the {{relationship}} with Branagh deteriorated, and entered into clinical depression. While filming Sense and Sensibility in 1995, she began a relationship with her co-star Greg Wise.

He picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> and put them together again." [...] The couple had a daughter, Gaia, in 1999. The pregnancy was achieved through IVF treatment when Thompson was 39.|$|E

500|$|Jacqui {{has been}} {{described}} as a feisty character who is tough and hard. Holy Soap refer to her as a [...] "tough ex-con". Jacqui often takes on the matriarch role. Jacqui deals with the sisters in a different way and can get different responses from the sisters. Cooper describes her as always being there to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> for her family. She also states that Jacqui is very loyal and the most loyal character out of the McQueen family. Speaking of Jacqui's time away from forefront plots Cooper has said: [...] "I think that Jacqui's one of those characters who, if she isn't on screen for a while, it takes the audience time to warm to her again. But when they do, they find her funny, they find her interesting and I try to give them as much as I can." ...|$|E
500|$|Differences {{were made}} between the {{original}} webisodes and the first episodes of the season. One example is the introduction of Druitt. In the webisodes, Druitt murders a prostitute after arriving in Old City, but in the pilot, writer Damian Kindler included dialogue between the two characters before Druitt murders her, {{as a way of}} proving to the audience how evil he is. Another is the ending of [...] "Fata Morgana", where the Morrígan leave the Sanctuary with the Cabal mercenaries; in the webisodes, the sisters escape. Druitt directly tells Ashley in one of the first webisodes that he is her father. In the first season, the producers decided that she would not be aware of this until midway through, and even then, they did not want Druitt to tell her directly, but rather hint it to her, so that Ashley can pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> herself.|$|E
500|$|After {{everyone}} {{finds out}} about Martha's situation, {{they try to}} stop her working in the club. Kate Ritchie who plays on-screen friend Sally Fletcher discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf have to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> {{for her in the}} end. She compared Martha's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through. Sally's interference made Martha's situation worse, of this Ritche added: [...] "It's been hard for Sally to realise and Alf as well, just that you just have to stand back and let it run its course and be there at the end." [...] Of Martha's downward spiral and pushing her friends away, Gordon stated: [...] "Now she's found herself in this hole, she ruined all these relationships with her family, her friends, Jack, everyone's trying to help her and she's really against everyone, she's in a really bad place at the moment".|$|E
