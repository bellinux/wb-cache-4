Historically, each energy crisis has brought society to a solutions crossroad: find more or use less. The latter path through conservation efforts has seldom triggered any excitement, so energy shocks have always triggered calls for more supply. With six billion people from the developing world seeking the same living standards {{as those in the}} affluent OECD countries the earth’s resources and environment are being put under great strain again. Tertzakian terms this problem the modern world's [...] "energy obesity."

50|$|The game uses a turn-based battle system, {{similar to}} the one used in Final Fantasy X. Only a maximum of three party members can fight in battle, with the {{character}} Mootie taking up a support role. In battle, party member commands are present on a dual-sided command ring, one side with the character's normal battle abilities and the other for summon special attacks. This allows the three members to have up to five actions on each side; a regular physical attack in the ring's middle and four abilities from summon stones equipped to the party members before entering a battle zone. In addition, each character has three consumption meters that can be filled in battle. Characters receive 20%-60% of a consumption meter point for each action they make and can <b>use</b> <b>consumption</b> meter points to summon their equipped summons. Battles run on a chain meter to determine the amount of rewards a player can select from chests after completing a battle zone. The meter loses points for taking actions from both the party and enemies, but players can raise the meter with crystals that drop in battle by defeating enemies or by using a summon's special attack. This chain meter can reach a maximum of 4.|$|E
50|$|Building on Oakland's {{legacy of}} climate progress, {{the next phase}} of action on energy and climate issues must consist of efforts in two major areas: Mitigation and Adaptation. These include {{strategies}} to reduce transportation fuel use, natural gas, electricity <b>use,</b> <b>consumption</b> and manufacture of material goods and waste management. Transportation & Land Use, Building Energy Use, and Material Consumption & Waste are the three largest sources of GHG emissions in Oakland. In July 2009, the Oakland City Council approved a preliminary GHG reduction target for the year 2020 of 36% below 2005 levels. This calls for a 36% reduction in emissions with respect to each of these GHG sources. The ECAP also recommends a Three Year Priority Implementation Plan, a prioritized subset of actions recommended for implementation in the next three years. The ECAP outlines the role that recent state-level policies are expected to play in reducing GHG emissions, and provides a vision for the role of community leadership. Implementing the actions identified in the ECAP has the potential to create a variety of community benefits, including energy cost savings, local green jobs and economic development, reduced local air pollution, improved public health, and other quality of life improvements throughout Oakland. The ECAP will be updated every three years to review progress, identify new priority actions and maintain momentum.|$|E

40|$|In the U. S., {{analyses}} of poverty {{rates and the}} effects of anti-poverty programs rely almost exclusively on income data. In earlier work (Meyer and Sullivan, 2003) we emphasized that conceptual arguments generally favor <b>using</b> <b>consumption</b> data to measure the well-being of the poor, and, on balance, data quality issues favor consumption in the case of single mothers. Our earlier work did not show that income and consumption differ in practice. Here we further examine data quality issues and show that important conclusions about recent trends depend on whether one <b>uses</b> <b>consumption</b> or income. Changes in the distribution of resources for single mothers differ sharply in recent years depending on whether measured by income or consumption. Measures of overall and sub-group poverty also sharply differ. In addition to examining broader populations and a longer time period, we also consider new dimensions of data quality such as survey and item nonresponse, imputation, and precision. Finally, we demonstrate the flaws in a recent paper that compares income and consumption data. ...|$|R
