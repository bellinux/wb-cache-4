50|$|Email {{privacy is}} the broad topic dealing {{with issues of}} {{unauthorized}} access and inspection of electronic mail. This unauthorized access can happen while an email is in transit, as well as when it is stored on email servers or on a <b>user</b> <b>computer.</b> In countries with a constitutional guarantee of the secrecy of correspondence, whether email can be equated with letters and get legal protection from all forms of eavesdropping comes under question because of {{the very nature of}} email.

In 1973 APL was generally available only on mainframe computers, and most desktop sized microcomputers such as the Wang 2200 or HP 9800 offered only BASIC.

You can Also record SIP trunks using port spans installed on specially configured network ports {{that do not have}} IP addresses and are used as sniffers for SIP traffic, and can be configured to record all or only specific calls. Most use informix and SQL databases and may use Integration Servers and IP Analyzers as well, sometimes clustered on one machine.|$|E

The robots access end <b>user</b> <b>computer</b> systems exactly {{as a human}} does - via the user interface with an established access control mechanism (e.g. logon ID and password) - so no underlying systems programming need be required. This is an important point because, from a security, quality and data integrity perspective, the UI of many applications encapsulates many years of requirements and testing for error prevention, data integrity and security access control. To bypass a UI by creating a new API is a risky undertaking and requires extensive testing in order that the same levels of functionality and protection are maintained.|$|E

This system allows the help desk to track and sort user requests {{with the help of a}} unique number, and can frequently classify problems by <b>user,</b> <b>computer</b> program, or similar categories. Many software applications are available to support the help desk function. Some target the enterprise level help desk and some target departmental needs.

This seminal, single user portable computer now resides in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.. Successful demonstrations of the 1973 SCAMP prototype led to the IBM 5100 portable microcomputer launched in 1975 with the ability to be programmed in both APL and BASIC for engineers, analysts, statisticians and other business problem-solvers. In the late 1960s such a machine would have been nearly as large as two desks and would have weighed about half a ton.|$|E

50|$|The {{security}} {{hole provided}} by Ad hoc networking {{is not the}} Ad hoc network itself but the bridge it provides into other networks, usually in the corporate environment, and the unfortunate default settings in most versions of Microsoft Windows to have this feature turned on unless explicitly disabled. Thus the user may not even know they have an unsecured Ad hoc network in operation on their computer. If they are also using a wired or wireless infrastructure network at the same time, they are providing a bridge to the secured organizational network through the unsecured Ad hoc connection. Bridging is in two forms. A direct bridge, which requires the user actually configure {{a bridge between the}} two connections and is thus unlikely to be initiated unless explicitly desired, and an indirect bridge which is the shared resources on the <b>user</b> <b>computer.</b> The indirect bridge may expose private data that is shared from the user's computer to LAN connections, such as shared folders or private Network Attached Storage, making no distinction between authenticated or private connections and unauthenticated Ad-Hoc networks. This presents no threats not already familiar to open/public or unsecured wifi access points, but firewall rules may be circumvented in the case of poorly configured operating systems or local settings.|$|E
5000|$|The kind of {{data that}} must be {{supplied}} to the TTP {{in order to get}} the trusted status is at present not entirely clear, but the TCG itself admits that [...] "attestation is an important TPM function with significant privacy implications". It is, however, clear that both static and dynamic information about the <b>user</b> <b>computer</b> may be supplied (Ekpubkey) to the TTP (v1.1b), it is not clear what data will be supplied to the “verifier” under v1.2. The static information will uniquely identify the endorser of the platform, model, details of the TPM, and that the platform (PC) complies with the TCG specifications [...] The dynamic information is described as software running on the computer. If a program like Windows is registered in the user’s name this in turn will uniquely identify the user. Another dimension of privacy infringing capabilities might also be introduced with this new technology; how often you use your programs might be possible information provided to the TTP. In an exceptional, however practical situation, where a user purchases a pornographic movie on the Internet, the purchaser nowadays, must accept the fact that he has to provide credit card details to the provider, thereby possibly risking being identified. With the new technology a purchaser might also risk someone finding out that he (or she) has watched this pornographic movie 1000 times. This adds a new dimension to the possible privacy infringement. The extent {{of data that}} will be supplied to the TTP/Verifiers is at present not exactly known, only when the technology is implemented and used will we be able to assess the exact nature and volume of the data that is transmitted.|$|E
