40|$|The Network Configuration Protocol (Netconf) is an IETF network {{management}} protocol using an RPCbased communication model. It {{was developed in}} the Netconf working group and published in December 2006 as RFC 4741 and later revised in June 2011 (RFC 6241). This protocol defines a simple mechanism through which a network device can be managed, configuration data information can be retrieved, and new configuration data can be <b>uploaded</b> <b>and</b> <b>manipulated.</b> The protocol allows the device to expose a full and formal application programming interface (API). Applications can use this straightforward API to send and receive full and partial configuration data sets.

40|$|Abstract A {{developer}} {{must often}} {{be able to}} understand a software system at several levels of detail [...] from abstract system architecture down to source code [...] before being able to change system functionality or fix bugs. Each of these levels might require its own notation and tools. For example, source code, written in a programming language, is viewed <b>and</b> <b>manipulated</b> <b>using</b> browsers <b>and</b> editors, whereas architectural designs, expressed as diagrams, are viewed <b>and</b> <b>manipulated</b> <b>using</b> visual editors. In this paper we show how a multi-view perspective of a software system can be realized, simply and economically, by loosely integrating a set of existing independent tools. Ideally, all environments would be designed a priori to allow their combination into tightly integrated systems. In actual fact, it is common that developers of individual tools cannot foresee the ways in which their tools will be used. People who integrate such tools must exploit what is available to them. The Star system demonstrates how loose integration among existing tools can rapidly and simply result in useful environments for software development. ...|$|R
