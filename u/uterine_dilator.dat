Case presentation A 45 -year-old African woman from Cameroon with no previous abdominal surgery {{presented with a}} three-day history of colicky abdominal pain. Abdominal X-ray showed an opaque, linear object in the lower abdomen. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a Hegar <b>uterine</b> <b>dilator</b> that was lost during a dilatation and curettage performed seven {{years prior to the}} present admission. Conclusions The trans-uterine route should be included as a rare and unusual source of surgical instruments retained in the abdomen. </p...|$|E

30|$|After {{discussing}} {{with the}} patient the various treatment options for this condition, {{it was decided to}} perform MEA. The patient also expressed her wish to be sterilised at the same time. She therefore was scheduled for an MEA and a laparoscopic sterilisation. Goserelin 3.6 mg was administered subcutaneously 5 weeks prior to the procedure in order to thin the endometrium. Uterine length was measured with a uterine sound. Dilatation of the cervix to 9 mm was performed with Hegarâ€™s <b>dilators.</b> <b>Uterine</b> length was checked again and found to be consistent with the first measurement. The microwave applicator probe was inserted and the measurement of uterine cavity confirmed, and the procedure was begun.|$|R
