500|$|The track [...] "Run-Away" [...] was {{singled out}} for praise by several {{publications}} with the Independent on Sunday calling the song [...] "outstanding", Culture Deluxe claiming the track showed the Super Furries at [...] "their pop-best" [...] and proved they [...] "could do no wrong" [...] and the NME stating that [...] "with a chorus as big as guitarist Huw Bunford's new serial-killer beard, it's {{up there with the}} most finely polished weapons in the SFA armoury". [...] "Baby Ate My Eightball" [...] received some criticism, with The Independent claiming that it [...] "falls short of expectations, its limp disco groove providing uncertain footing for Rhys's rococo confection of harmonies" [...] and Uncut stating that the song, along with [...] "Neo Consumer", doesn't [...] "tell <b>us</b> <b>anything</b> we didn't already know" [...] about the band.|$|E
500|$|Watts's use of colour was an {{immediate}} success with critics; even those who otherwise disliked the piece were impressed by Watts's skilful use of colour, tone and harmony. Its subject and Watts's technique immediately drew criticism from the press. The Times described it as [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} of [...] recent pictures" [...] but observed that while [...] "in point of colour Mr.Watts has seldom given <b>us</b> <b>anything</b> more lovely and delicate... and there is great beauty in the drawing, though it must be owned that the angles are too many and too marked". The Portfolio praised Watts's Repentance of Cain but thought Hope [...] "a poetic but somewhat inferior composition". Theodore Child of The Fortnightly Review dismissed Hope as [...] "a ghastly and apocalyptic allegory", while the highly regarded critic Claude Phillips considered it [...] "an exquisite concept, insufficiently realised by a failed execution".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Patient X" [...] the eighth most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show, citing, in particular the abuse of Dmitri. The article noted that [...] "If The X-Files has taught <b>us</b> <b>anything,</b> it’s that if a G-Man asks us if we know anything about anything and we foolishly say yes, our mouths and eyelids will be sewn shut {{and we will be}} brainwashed to kill on demand." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Patient X" [...] a B+, and wrote that the episode [...] "feels epic, in a way the mythology episodes do at their best". However, VanDerWerff noted that [...] "The problem with breaking the status quo on a TV series is that your audience is always going to know in the back of its head that the status quo isn’t really broken." [...] He reasoned that the audience never fully believed that [...] "Mulder could lose his belief in the all-consuming alien conspiracy" [...] or accept the idea that [...] "Scully could find herself dabbling with belief in [...]" [...] Despite these set-backs, however, he noted that [...] "Patient X" [...] was the episode where the series' mythology [...] "gets moving again, after chasing its own tail throughout much of season four and reaching a sort of climax in the opening episodes of season five." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two described the tone of [...] "Patient X" [...] as [...] "truly visceral", citing the faceless men incinerating people as well as the mutilation of the innocent Dmitri, who was [...] "at {{the wrong place at the}} wrong time". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised the episode for [...] "shift the goalposts" [...] and allowing Mulder and Scully to switch roles as the believer and skeptic. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's premise and writing. [...] "'Patient X' is a rare episode in that it actually advances The X-Files mythology, with the news of a vaccine to combat the black oil". However, she was critical of the episode's reliance on shock value, noting that the [...] "camera seems to take a perverse delight in death, pain, and mutilation, with the distressing effect of numbing the viewer to the horror." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Gamearena {{criticized the}} {{depiction}} of the heroine and the game's lack of mass-market appeal: [...] "Many people found DMC too campy and over-the-top, and Bayonetta makes it look monochrome in comparison. If you don't like the genre, Bayonetta will not change your mind." [...] GameSpot's video review lamented duller graphics and inconsistent frame rates for its PS3 port. The Associated Press review opined that [...] "Bayonetta feels like a game that would have blown me away 15 years ago. (It even pays tribute to Sega arcade classics like Space Harrier and Hang-On.)

2500|$|Writing for The London Review of Books in February 2017, Michael Wood {{characterized}} {{the film as}} a study of an inherited intergenerational tragedy.

The silence doesn't tell <b>us</b> <b>anything,</b> it just asks us {{to feel sorry for}} him... All is not lost, though, because as we gaze at Chiron, we can think of something else: his resemblance to Juan (his father figure). Does it mean that Juan was once a Chiron... Not quite that perhaps, but the last shot of the film is of the young Chiron sitting on the beach... looking out at the ocean... His wide eyes suggest all the desolation and promise that Juan saw in him at the beginning. If we started again, would things be different?" ...|$|E

[...] "In respect of our partners we can only say this, at no time in our discussions did they convey to us that the plan was unacceptable so long as president Aristide remained in office. Nor did they suggest to <b>us</b> <b>anything</b> of a nature pertaining to the conduct of President Aristide in office that would cause us to come to the judgment ourselves that he was unsuited to be the President of Haïti," [...] Mr. Patterson said. The U.S. and France have been accused of using pressure on CARICOM to not make a formal UN request for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Aristide's removal.|$|E
2500|$|In Gratz v. Bollinger, Thomas said that, in his view, [...] "a State's use {{of racial}} {{discrimination}} in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause." [...] In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, Thomas joined the opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, who concluded that [...] "he way to stop {{discrimination on the basis}} of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race." [...] Concurring, Thomas wrote that [...] "if our history has taught <b>us</b> <b>anything,</b> it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories," [...] and charged that the dissent carried [...] "similarities" [...] to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in Brown v. Board of Education. In Grutter v. Bollinger, he approvingly quoted Justice Harlan's Plessy v. Ferguson dissent: [...] "Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens." [...] In a concurrence in Missouri v. Jenkins (1995), he wrote that the Missouri District Court [...] "has read our cases to support the theory that black students suffer an unspecified psychological harm from segregation that retards their mental and educational development. This approach not only relies upon questionable social science research rather than constitutional principle, but it also rests on an assumption of black inferiority." ...|$|E
2500|$|John S. Carlile of transmontane Alleghany County, like Willey an Unconditional Unionist, {{stressed}} that western Virginians {{were committed to}} slavery as “essential to American liberty.” But he would not run away from devotion to the Union. “This government that we {{are called upon to}} destroy has never brought <b>us</b> <b>anything</b> but good. No injury has it ever inflicted on us. No act has every been put upon the statute book of our common country, interfering with the institution of slavery in any shape, manner or form, that was not put there by and with the consent of the slave-holding States of this Union…” If Virginia joined the Confederacy, the North would no longer be bound by the Constitution to stand by slavery and slave-holding states, and it would join with England, France and Spain to extinguish slavery everywhere. Thomas Jefferson's grandson, George Wythe Randolph, now a Richmond lawyer, made a secessionist speech, observing that although the Republicans had captured the United States Government “in strict accordance with Constitutional forms”, it was merely sectional. “The Government, then…is constitutionally revolutionized, and requires a counter-revolution to restore it.” But “Let [...] go with us into a Southern Confederacy, and receive protection from Northern industry, and they will be what they ought to be—the manufacturers and miners of a great [...] nation.” We should go into the Confederacy, “we are told it will bring war. On the contrary it will tend to avert war…Neutrality is impossible and would be dishonorable.” ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 23, 2015, Upfront Ventures, {{the largest}} early-stage fund raised in L.A since 2000, {{appointed}} Chamillionaire as an entrepreneur in residence. This {{marks the first}} time an honor of this kind has been bestowed upon a rap artist. Chamillionaire hopes that this pivotal new role will allow him to help usher in the next generation of tech entrepreneurs as well as continue to offer valuable advice and investment capital to worthy start-ups. A spokesperson for Upfront Ventures has stated that; [...] "Chamillionaire brings a wealth of expertise in this area to the table based on his own years of employing successful tech and marketing strategies as both an independent music artist and later a label partner with Universal Records. Add to that he has quietly been a fixture in the tech world for many years: attending major conferences both as a keynote and audience member, making him a sought-after promotional partner, advisor and potential investor. It was in this capacity that he met Upfront partner, Mark Suster, in 2009, becoming one of the earliest co-investors in Maker Studios, now a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company." [...] In a letter penned by Mark Suster explaining the week he's had at Upfront Ventures in Los Angeles, he explains the presence of Chamillionaire around the office. [...] "The same Chamillionaire who was showing us how to get our respective shines on not a decade ago. But if Kanye has taught <b>us</b> <b>anything,</b> it's that we can find success in multiple creative outlets. In the past five years or so, Cham has been quietly but actively involved in the tech startup scene, from speaking on social media engagement in the music industry to hanging out with Y Combinator associates." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{concurrence}} {{with the}} majority opinion Justice Clarence Thomas restated his view, in agreement with Justice Harlan's dissent in Plessy, that the Constitution is [...] "color-blind." [...] For Thomas, this means that no {{discrimination on the basis}} of race is permitted by the Constitution, even for a so-called [...] "benign" [...] purpose (Thomas rejected the notion that there could be a purely benign purpose in his concurrence in Adarand because the benignity or malignity of race-based discrimination turns on [...] "whose ox is being gored" [...] or is [...] "in the eye of the beholder"). [...] Justice Thomas also rejected the view advanced by the dissent that these school districts were in danger of resegregation. [...] He contended that whatever trends toward classroom racial imbalance have obtained, they were not the result of state-sanctioned segregation as in the pre-Brown era. Justice Thomas goes on to call out the dissent for adopting segregationist reasoning advanced in Brown, particularly its insistence that the Court should defer to local school board knowledge, expertise, and judgment. [...] He also wrote about the unsettled debate concerning whether racial balance or diversity has a positive effect on educational outcomes. [...] Justice Thomas recoils at the suggestion that black students can only learn if they are sitting next to white students. [...] Some of the concurrence consists of social science citations and statistics showing that black students can succeed in majority black schools such as HBCUs. [...] Justice Thomas concludes noting [...] "If our history has taught <b>us</b> <b>anything</b> it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories." [...] In a footnote the Justice added a personal mention of Justice Breyer: [...] "Justice Breyer's good intentions, which I do not doubt, have the shelf life of Justice Breyer's tenure." [...] He goes on to explain that he is skeptical that school boards will always have such good intentions in their race-based decisionmaking, for, as Madison said, [...] "if men were angels, no government would be necessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael F. Whiting, {{director}} of Brigham Young University's DNA Sequencing Center {{and an associate}} professor in BYU's Department of Integrative Biology, concluded in his article [...] "DNA and the Book of Mormon: A Phylogenetic Perspective" [...] that Book of Mormon critics attempting to use DNA [...] "have not given <b>us</b> <b>anything</b> that would pass the muster of peer review by scientists in this field, because they have ignored the real complexity of the issues involved. Further, they have overlooked the entire concept of hypothesis testing in science and believe that just because they label their results as 'based on DNA,' they have somehow proved that the results are accurate or that they have designed the experiment correctly. At best, they have demonstrated that the global colonization hypothesis is an oversimplified interpretation of the Book of Mormon. At worst, they have misrepresented themselves and the evidence in the pursuit of other agendas." [...] Additionally, although he admits the usefulness of population genetics and of DNA in inferring historical events, he contests that, [...] "given the complexities of genetic drift, founder effect, and introgression, the observation that Native Americans have a preponderance of Asian genes does not conclusively demonstrate that they are therefore not descendants of the Lamanite lineage, because {{we do not know what}} genetic signature that Lamanite lineage possessed at the conclusion of the Book of Mormon record." [...] Lastly, he concludes, [...] " [...] a strong possibility that there was substantial introgression of genes from other human populations into the genetic heritage of the Nephites and Lamanites, such that a unique genetic marker to identify someone unambiguously as a Lamanite, if it ever existed, was quickly lost." [...] and that, [...] "here are some very good scientific reasons for why the Book of Mormon is neither easily corroborated nor refuted by DNA evidence, and current attempts to do so are based on dubious science" [...]|$|E
