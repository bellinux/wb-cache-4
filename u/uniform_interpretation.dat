40|$|This paper investigates {{interpretations of}} L forms {{in which the}} {{substitution}} defining the <b>interpretation</b> is <b>uniform</b> in terminal letters. Such <b>uniform</b> <b>interpretations</b> have several advantages over the ordinary ones, both from a mathematical and biological point of view. A number of different aspects of <b>uniform</b> <b>interpretations</b> are studied. It is felt that the results will shed {{new light on the}} theory of L forms and, in general, on the theory of L systems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn [5] {{the notion}} of an L form F {{defining}} a family Ld(F) of languages by means of X-interpretations has been introduced. Here X is {{one of a number of}} possible variations of {{the notion of}} interpretation originally used in [1] for grammar forms. In this paper it is shown that the questions whether Ld(F) = Ld(F 1) for L forms F and F 1 is decidable, if deterministic interpretations of PDOL systems are considered, where L(F) and L(F 1) contain at most one word of length n for any n ⩾ 0, and it is shown that same question is undecidable, if full or <b>uniform</b> <b>interpretations</b> are chosen. In contrast to this, no such results are known for grammar forms at this point...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{combinatorial}} model for cluster algebras of type $D_n$ {{in terms of}} centrally symmetric pseudotriangulations of a regular $ 2 n$-gon with a small disk in the centre. This model provides convenient and <b>uniform</b> <b>interpretations</b> for clusters, cluster variables and their exchange relations, {{as well as for}} quivers and their mutations. We also present a new combinatorial interpretation of cluster variables in terms of perfect matchings of a graph after deleting two of its vertices. This interpretation differs from known interpretations in the literature. Its main feature, in contrast with other interpretations, is that for a fixed initial cluster seed, one or two graphs serve for the computation of all cluster variables. Finally, we discuss applications of our model to polytopal realizations of type $D$ associahedra and connections to subword complexes and $c$-cluster complexes. Comment: 21 pages, 21 figure...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, a {{comparative}} linguistic investigation of morphological deficits in two English-speaking and two Greek-speaking agrammatic aphasic patients is presented. Adopting the Strong Lexicalist Hypothesis, the study {{focuses on the}} subjects' ability to repeat, comprehend and produce nominal and verbal inflections. The hypotheses investigated concern the effects of language-specific features in agrammatic performance {{and the role of}} morphological principles in the two languages. Finally the implications of the data for linguistic theory are investigated. The data show that language-specific features are crucial in determining aphasic performance. Principles of well-formedness of lexical items appear to remain unaffected. Morphological deficits are found to manifest themselves at different levels: the lexical and the postlexical. A Storage Hypothesis which reflects the word structure of complex lexical items in the brain is proposed. Finally, it is proposed that only through a Strong Lexicalist framework can one achieve <b>uniform</b> <b>interpretations</b> of morphological deficits in aphasia...|$|R
40|$|In the abstract, {{there should}} be little quarrel with the {{proposition}} that theories of statutory interpretation should be subjected to empirical testing. 2 ̆ 7 Pragmatic thinkers and practitioners ought {{to be open to}} any theory that has a 2 ̆ 2 cash-value, 2 ̆ 2 as philosopher William James put it. 2 ̆ 7 If an uncompromising application of statutory plain meaning, what I have called the 2 ̆ 2 new textualism, 2 ̆ 2 produces more predictable results than eclectic theories now deployed by pragmatic judges and scholars, then theory and practice ought to move toward textualism, even more than they already have. If studies deploying a variety of rigorous techniques show that following a textualist approach generates more consistent and <b>uniform</b> <b>interpretations</b> by a variety of different judges than other approaches to statutory interpretation (original intent, purpose), pragmatists ought to consider those findings as a significant reason to support and adopt a more strictly textual approach to statutory interpretation...|$|R
40|$|We use D-instantons {{to probe}} the {{geometry}} of Misner universe, and calculate the world volume field theory action, which is of the 1 + 0 dimensional form and highly non-local. Turning on closed string tachyons, we see from the deformed moduli space of the D-instantons that the spacelike singularity is removed and the region near the singularity becomes a fuzzy cone, where space and time do not commute. When realized cosmologically there can be controllable trans-planckian effects. And the infinite past is now causally connected with the infinite future, thus also providing a model for big crunch/big bang transition. In the spirit of IKKT matrix theory, we propose that the D-instanton action here provides a holographic description for Misner universe and time is generated dynamically. In addition we show that winding string production from the vacua and instability of D-branes have simple <b>uniform</b> <b>interpretations</b> in this second quantized formalism.

40|$|This project (IIS 00 - 81550) {{consists}} of three sets of laboratory studies which will examine {{the degree to which}} different types of user interfaces to survey systems promote <b>uniform</b> <b>interpretations</b> of questions [...] - and thus higher quality data. In particular, the studies focus on improving clarification dialogue and system diagnosis of user uncertainty. Users' response accuracy is assessed on the basis of government definitions for key survey concepts; in conjunction with time and satisfaction measures, accuracy indicates which approaches to interface design are most promising for web based surveys for collecting official statistics. The studies explore desktop (windows, keyboard entry, and mouse clicking) and speech survey interviewing systems, some of which are implemented as prototypes while others are simulated. The primary goals of the project are to inform the design of computerized survey systems, but the results apply to the growing class of applications that collect information from users: on-line job applications, forms for e-commerce, on-line tax forms, electronic standardized tests, electronic voting systems, etc. They contrast with systems for retrieving information and may have quite different properties...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{definitions}} of cultural codes introduced by the classics of sociology within their key theoretical concepts. The authors believe that automatic deduction of ‘cultural code’ interpretation from the concept ‘culture’ within any theoretical approach is not relevant to the rules of sociological knowledge, thus, they identify differences in the contexts that generate similar definitions of cultural codes. The authors analyze definitions of cultural codes in structural functionalism, neo-functionalism, structuralism, post-structuralism, post-marxism, structuralist constructivism and symbolic interactionism to show that the explanations of social reality and its relationships with culture through the notion of cultural codes imply fundamentally different descriptions of the system of social relations even within the same theoretical approach. The authors consider key works and positions of a number of classics of sociology and conclude that representatives of all major theoretical approaches tried to identify the concept ‘cultural codes’. However, while recognizing its significant potential, most theoretical approaches simply considered two or three elements of culture to be components of the cultural code without any reasoned explanation why all other elements of culture were excluded. Moreover, there are no <b>uniform</b> <b>interpretations</b> of cultural codes even within each of the above mentioned theoretical approaches...|$|R

50|$|What {{is known}} of the Duat derives principally from funerary texts such as the Book of Gates, the Book of Caverns, the Coffin Texts, the Amduat, and the Book of the Dead. Each of these {{documents}} fulfilled a different purpose and gave a different perspective on the Duat, and different texts could be inconsistent with one another. This did not have mean, in the Egyptian understanding, that one who believed in one interpertation should have denied the other, as there was an understanding of multiplicity of approaches.

5000|$|The highest {{judicial}} organ at {{the federal}} level was the Supreme Court of Czechoslovakia. Supreme Court judges were elected by the Federal Assembly to serve ten-year terms of office. The Federal Assembly also selected a chairman and vice chairman of the Supreme Court. If the chairman was from the Czech Socialist Republic, the vice chairman must have been from the Slovak Socialist Republic, and vice versa. The two republics must have been represented by an equal number of Supreme Court judges. Petitions for breach of law against decisions of the republic supreme courts were heard in the Supreme Court {{at the federal}} level. In addition to serving as the nation's final court of appeals, the Supreme Court of Czechoslovakia examined the legality of decisions of the federal government and, in general, ensured the <b>uniform</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the laws.
