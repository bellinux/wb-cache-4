5000|$|Two of {{the most}} memorable moments for Robert were going to the White House to meet President Reagan and the First lady and to also meet Audrey Hepburn. Robert met Ms. Hepburn when he was chosen to create a picture frame during a <b>UNICEF</b> fundraiser, which <b>housed</b> an autographed picture of Ms. Hepburn as Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Much of the work {{produced}} by Whiteside was presented to and owned by the Reagan administration; other individuals include Lady Bird Johnson and several dignitaries including Queen Silvia of Sweden, Crown Princess Michiko of Japan and the wives of Chancellor Kohl of West Germany, Prime Minister Nakasone of Japan, Prime Minister Chirac of France, Prime Minister Mulroney of Canada, President Duarte of El Salvador and President Sarney of Brazil [...] (5).

50|$|The {{government}} assessed {{that about}} 35% {{of those who}} lost their houses had the resources to rebuild without assistance; this meant that 144,692 houses had to be rebuilt. Many of the storm victims left homeless resided in tent camps, schools, and temporary shelters, until more permanent buildings were built. The Red Cross housed about 60,000 people across ten provinces in temporary shelters. The Philippine government planned to quickly build more permanent homes, although there were difficulties in securing land and materials for the new housing. By March 2007, government and international agencies only provided 6.9% of the necessary homes, forcing people to stay in shelters longer than expected. By {{a year after the}} storm, over 10,000 families still stayed in transit camps in Albay and Camarines Sur. Various organizations helped the homeless secure housing. The government of Italy funded a ₱26 million ($525,000 USD) project to rebuild 180 houses in Albay. The Italian government also helped build new livelihood centers to provide jobs, provided new boats, and donated about 80,000 coconut seeds to replant trees. In the eight months after Durian struck, the Philippine National Red Cross, in conjunction with the International Red Cross, delivered building supplies to about 12,000 families to repair their homes or build new ones. The organizations encouraged residents to rebuild houses away from vulnerable areas. The International Organization for Migration, in conjunction with the United States Agency for International Development, built 907 homes and new community centers. The Philippine government released ₱76 million ($1.5 million) in funds to build 1,089 <b>houses.</b> <b>UNICEF</b> provided emergency funding to rebuild 50 daycare centers that were damaged by the typhoon. Habitat for Humanity helped repair about 1,200 homes, build about 2,000 new houses, and rebuilt four schools in Sorsogon.|$|R
