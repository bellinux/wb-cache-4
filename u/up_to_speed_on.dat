During the caution, Johnson, Earnhardt and Hamlin made pit stops. Jeff Gordon stayed out of pit road and the led the field to restart on lap 237. Four laps later, Logano {{collided with the}} wall, but escaped with minor damage. On lap 247, Edwards moved into sixth. Four laps later, a fifth caution came out when Robby Gordon's car suffered an engine failure. All of the leaders elected to pit under caution, giving the lead to Earnhardt The race restarted on lap 259. On lap 260, Jeff Gordon moved back into the lead, while Earnhardt fell back to the seventh position. Three laps later, Edwards passed Brian Vickers to move into ninth.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{set about}} {{applying}} his business principles to his cabinet, putting {{his experience as}} both a corporate manager and rowing coach to use in a cabinet system that was orderly and practical. He implemented a formal system whereby a proper agenda for cabinet meetings would be formulated, and the minister responsible for each item would circulate papers to bring other members <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> the issue. His decision-making procedures ensured that his colleagues were informed and actively participated in decisions or if they disagreed, gave leave for cabinet members to absent themselves from meetings to preserve cabinet solidarity. In this respect Bruce earned the quick respect and approval of his colleagues, and in many respects came to dominate cabinet through his industriousness and knowledgability. Cabinet minister George Pearce would later conclude that Bruce {{was the best of}} the prime ministers that he served or opposed in his 38-year parliamentary career.|$|E

5|$|Edwards passed Earnhardt {{to reclaim}} the lead on lap 195, while Earnhardt lost a further {{position}} after Kenseth got ahead of him on the same lap. Ten laps later, Biffle moved ahead of Harvick to take fifth place, while his teammate Kenseth had a 1.5-second lead over the second-place Edwards by the 211th lap. Three laps later, the seventh caution was issued when officials located debris in the turn-two groove. The leaders, including Edwards, chose to make pit stops for tires and car adjustments. One tire from Edwards' car went outside his pit box {{but he was not}} penalized because a cameraman blocked Edwards' crew from retrieving the tire. Kenseth led the field back <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> the lap-219 restart; Earnhardt was in second place and Edwards third. Casey Mears hit Vickers, who spun and triggered the eighth caution on lap 224; both drivers avoided contacting the wall. Kenseth maintained the lead on the lap-227 restart. Edwards drove up the track in an attempt to take the lead on lap 229, but Kenseth kept the position. Four laps later, the ninth caution was needed when Dale Jarrett spun and hit the turn-two outside wall. Kenseth remained the leader at the restart on lap 236. Edwards passed teammate Kenseth for the lead two laps later, and began to pull away. Earnhardt caught up to Kenseth by lap 243 and ten laps later he passed Kenseth for second.|$|E

Jeff Gordon moved up to third on lap 18, and Martin moved from third to eighth by the same lap. Kyle Busch and Edwards ran alongside {{each other in the}} battle for the first position on lap 20; the battle concluded after Edwards passed Kyle Busch on the following lap. Gordon was passed by Biffle for third place on lap 22, while Kurt Busch moved up to fifth on the same lap. By lap 28, Biffle had closed the gap to Kyle Busch and passed him for second position two laps later. Edwards had a 1.3-second lead over teammate Biffle on the same lap. Kyle Busch fell to fourth place after Gordon passed him on the 33rd lap. Kyle Busch reclaimed the third position from Gordon two laps later; Kurt Busch had moved into third after moving ahead of Gordon on the same lap. By the 42nd lap, Edwards and teammate Biffle had opened a three-second lead over Kyle Busch. Riggs and Kurt Busch both moved in front of Kyle Busch for third and fourth positions on lap 45.|$|E

25|$|Williams had {{not been}} {{involved}} with experiments that had been carried out by troop carriers over the previous months and was therefore not <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> the latest pathfinder equipment and tactics, which were neglected during the planning phase of HUSKY. Moreover, the route chosen for the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing's operation was particularly difficult, involving three sharp turns over water in dim moonlight. Williams was unable to secure the necessary agreement from the naval commander, Vice Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt for a straighter route. Nor was he able to persuade the Twelfth Air Force to provide a fighter escort for his troop carriers or to fly searchlight neutralisation missions, although the RAF agreed to fly some missions against searchlights. On 21 May, Williams moved his headquarters from Casablanca to Oujda in order to observe the progress of training of the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing and the 82nd Airborne Division. At least one of his group commanders felt that Williams was over-optimistic about the proficiency of his crews.|$|E
500|$|Before a Hammond organ {{can produce}} sound, the motor {{that drives the}} tonewheels must come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>speed.</b> <b>On</b> most models, {{starting}} a Hammond organ involves two switches. The [...] "Start" [...] switch turns a dedicated starter motor, which must run for about 12 seconds. Then, the [...] "Run" [...] switch is turned on for about four seconds. The [...] "Start" [...] switch is then released, whereupon the organ is ready to generate sound. The H-100 and E-series consoles and L-100 and T-100 spinet organs, however, had a self-starting motor that required only a single [...] "On" [...] switch. A pitch bend effect can be created on the Hammond organ by turning the [...] "Run" [...] switch off and on again.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of speed and leg prostheses on mediolateral (ML) foot placement and its variability in sprinters with and without transtibial amputations. We hy-pothesized that ML foot placement variability would: 1. increase with running <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> maximum <b>speed</b> and 2. be symmetrical between the legs of non-amputee sprinters but asymmetrically greater for the affected leg of sprinters with a unilateral transtibial amputa-tion. We measured the midline of the body (kinematic data) and center of pressure (kinetic data) in the ML direction while 12 non-amputee sprinters and 7 Paralympic sprinters with transtibial amputations (6 unilateral, 1 bilateral) ran across a range of <b>speeds</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> maxi-mum <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> a high-speed force measuring treadmill. We quantified ML foot placement relative to the body’s midline and its variability. We interpret our results with respect to a hy-pothesized relation between ML foot placement variability and lateral balance. We infer that greater ML foot placement variability indicates greater challenges with maintaining lateral balance. In non-amputee sprinters, ML foot placement variability for each leg increased substantially and symmetrically across speed. In sprinters with a unilateral amputation, M...|$|R

After the feature event was completed, he competed in a five-mile {{handicap}} race against five other riders. Among them was Ray Seymour, who held the world record. Hasha and Seymour {{were the only two}} riders to race without a handicap; the other four were given a one-lap handicap. Hasha held a slight lead {{at the end of the}} first lap. While leading on the third lap, Hasha's motorcycle began to misfire. He reached his hand down to make an adjustment, and was overtaken by Seymour. Hasha accelerated, picking <b>up</b> enough <b>speed</b> <b>to</b> close <b>on</b> Seymour. Traveling at 92 mph, Hasha's motorcycle suddenly turned sharply into the rail surrounding the track. The bike rode the rail for around 100 ft, killing a boy who had put his head over the rail to watch the race. The machine then struck a large post. Hasha flew out of the racing area into the grandstands, and was killed instantly. Three other boys and a young man were also killed. The now-riderless machine dropped back onto the racing surface into the path of last-place rider Johnny Albright. The motorcycle hit the Denver rider in the shoulder and he slid down the track between the two machines. Albright died four hours later without regaining consciousness. Spectators panicked at the sight of a spinning motorcycle heading their way. Several people had broken bones and flesh wounds as they fought and trampled each other in the rush to get out of the way. It took over an hour to clear the grandstands. Medics came from all parts of the city to attend to the injured and those who had fainted.|$|R
