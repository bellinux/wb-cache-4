Even though an exact and universal traffic model is hard to define, there are several heavily used models such as permutation traffic, uniform random traffic, ON-OFF bursty traffic and so on. In this paper, we present a way of generating various basic traffic types using the inverse transformation technique for testing and analysis of a packet switch.

In this paper, we shall study dynamic resource allocation for OFDMA-based single-cell multicast systems. Specifically, we shall formulate an optimization problem to maximize the system throughput given a set of available resources (power and sub-carriers). The optimal resource allocation solution is proposed along with a low-complexity algorithm. In two extreme cases, namely, low and high SNR regimes, the low-complexity allocation algorithm is further simplified. Numerical results will show that the system throughput is significantly improved by using our proposed algorithms...|$|R

Since unicasting messages are broadcasted to all the users, how the use of NOMA can prevent those multicasting receivers intercepting the unicasting messages is also investigated, where it is shown that the secrecy unicasting rate achieved by NOMA is always larger than or equal to that of OMA. This security gain is mainly {{due to the fact that}} the multicasting messages can be used as jamming signals to prevent potential eavesdropping when the multicasting and unicasting messages are superimposed together following the NOMA principle...|$|R

40|$|Channel change {{time is a}} {{critical}} quality of experience (QOE) metric for IP-based video delivery systems such as Internet Protocol Television (IPTV). An interesting channel change acceleration scheme based on peer-assisted delivery was recently proposed, which consists of deploying one FCC server (Fast Channel Change Server) in the IP backbone in order to send the unicast stream to the STB (Set-Top Box) before sending the normal multicast stream after each channel change. However, deploying such a solution will cause high bandwidth usage in the network because of the huge <b>unicast</b> <b>traffic</b> sent by the FCC server to the STBs. In this paper, we propose a new solution to reduce the bandwidth occupancy of the <b>unicast</b> <b>traffic,</b> by deploying the FCC server capabilities on the user STB. This means that, after each channel change request, the STB will receive the <b>unicast</b> <b>traffic</b> from another STB instead of the central server. By using this method, the <b>unicast</b> <b>traffic</b> will not pass through the IP network; {{it will be a}} peer-to-peer communication via the Access Network only.

40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{increasing}} multicast applications and high desire for its deployment, it seems that any new technology should support multicast. However, Mpls (Multiprotocol Label Switching) technology which enhances IP packet forwarding capability by using layer 2 switching still does not offer any special solution for multicast support. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism for multicast over Mpls. We separate labels for <b>unicast</b> and multicast <b>traffic.</b> Our method use one label for each multicast tree. Therefore, consumes fewer labels compared to existing proposals and has smaller forwarding tables. Index Terms—MPLS, MPLS Multicast, Multicast, Multicast over MPLS. common between multicast and <b>unicast</b> <b>traffics.</b> As a result, the label assignment process to the multicast traffic is not a trivial task currently. Besides, for each multicast tree branch, an output label must be stored in MFT of an LSR which consumes invaluable memory and label. In contrast, our architecture uses a unique label to identify a multicast tree. Therefore, we store only one entry for each multicast tree in MT (Multicast Table) of an LSR that considerably reduces the MT size. By using this scheme {{there is no need}} to label swapping. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the related works. Then, our method is explained in section 3. Finally, we conclude the paper in section 5. I...|$|R

40|$|High-availability {{seamless}} redundancy (HSR) is {{a protocol}} for Ethernet networks that provides duplicated frames with zero recovery {{time in the}} event of any network component’s failure. It is suited for applications that demand high availability and a very short time-outs such as substation automation systems (SAS). However, HSR generates excessive unnecessary unicast frames and spreads them throughout connected-ring networks, whether or not the destination node exists in network’s rings. This unnecessary redundant traffic causes high bandwidth consumption, resulting in degradation of network performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for filtering and reducing HSR <b>unicast</b> <b>traffic</b> in connected-ring networks, called “filtering HSR traffic” (FHT). The purpose of FHT is to filter HSR <b>unicast</b> <b>traffic</b> and remove circulated traffic for all rings in connected-ring networks. Therefore, FHT significantly reduces network <b>unicast</b> <b>traffic</b> in connected-ring networks. The traffic performance of FHT has been analyzed, evaluated, and compared to that of standard HSR protocol and the port locking (PL) approach. Various simulations were conducted to validate the traffic performance analysis. Analytical and simulation results showed that, for our sample network, FHT reduced network <b>unicast</b> <b>traffic</b> by about 82 % compared with standard HSR and by about 56 % compared with the PL approach, thus freeing up network bandwidth and improving network traffic performance...|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies on}} {{performance}} of IEEE 802. 11 DCF networks do not contemplate {{the existence of}} broadcast traffic.

This work presents a new traffic generalized model for CSMA/CA saturated single-hop networks able to describe the network behaviour in presence of both unicast and broadcast frames. Interesting statistics like station transmission probability, average time needed to complete a frame transmission, and network aggregate throughput are deduced from the model.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a very {{effectively}} filtering approach (EFA) to enhance network traffic performance for high-availability seamless redundancy (HSR) protocol in smart grids. The EFA combines a novel filtering technique for QuadBox rings (FQR) with two existing filtering techniques, including quick removing (QR) and port locking (PL), to effectively reduce redundant <b>unicast</b> <b>traffic</b> within HSR networks. The EFA filters <b>unicast</b> <b>traffic</b> for both unused terminal rings {{by using the}} PL technique and unused QuadBox rings based on the newly-proposed FQR technique. In addition, by using the QR technique, the EFA prevents the unicast frames from being duplicated and circulated in rings; the EFA thus significantly reduces redundant <b>unicast</b> <b>traffic</b> in HSR networks compared with the standard HSR protocol and existing traffic filtering techniques. The EFA also reduces control overhead compared with the filtering HSR traffic (FHT) technique. In this study, the performance of EFA was analyzed, evaluated, and {{compared to that of}} the standard HSR protocol and existing techniques, and various simulations were conducted to validate the performance analysis. The analytical and simulation results showed that for the sample networks, the proposed EFA reduced network <b>unicast</b> <b>traffic</b> by 80 % compared with the standard HSR protocol and by 26 – 62 % compared with existing techniques. The proposed EFA also reduced control overhead by up to 90 % compared with the FHT, thus decreasing control overhead, freeing up network bandwidth, and improving network traffic performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} estimate wireless link quality {{is critical to}} the performance of routing protocols and rate adaptation algorithms in wireless mesh networks. Current link quality estimation methods utilize the packet delivery ratio (PDR) measurement of periodic broadcast probes sent at the lowest transmission rate.

In this paper, we propose the use of a measurement-based signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) model to estimate wireless link quality in terms of its PDR performance. Using broadcast traffic measurements at the lowest transmission rate, we construct an "SNR profile 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 that characterizes the relationship between the PDR metric and the SNR values computed at a node. We show how we can use the SNR profile to predict the PDR performance at different transmission rates. More importantly, we argue that the frame delivery ratio (FDR) at the MAC layer is a better link quality metric compared to PDR, and show that our proposed approach can use an SNR profile generated with broadcast traffic, to accurately estimate the FDR performance of <b>unicast</b> data <b>traffic</b> at different transmission rates. This then allows us to also accurately estimate the maximum achievable throughput of the wireless link at those rates...|$|R

40|$|High energy {{consumption}} in Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPONs) has caused intense research on energy-saving methods in recent years. The most common method for EPON energy saving is to cause optical network units (ONUs) to sleep which are idle or low loaded.

Integrated schedulers capable of dealing with both traffic types have been designed mainly for Input Queued (IQ) buffer-less crossbar switches. Combined Input and Crossbar Queued (CICQ) switches, on the other hand, are known to have better performance than their buffer-less predecessors due to their potential in simplifying the scheduling and improving the switching performance. The design of integrated schedulers in CICQ switches has thus far been neglected. In this paper, we propose a novel CICQ architecture that supports both <b>unicast</b> and multicast <b>traffic</b> along with its appropriate scheduling.
