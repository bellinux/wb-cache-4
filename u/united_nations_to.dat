5|$|In January 2014, Mam Sonando {{organized}} a mass demonstration, which demanded {{the government to}} expand his radio reach and open a TV station. The Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith denied the permission for the expansion but Mam Sonando told reporters the denial is unconstitutional. Protesters clashed with police on January 28, injuring at least 9 of the demonstrators. In response to the violence, Human Rights Watch calls for the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>to</b> pressure the Cambodian government. Reporters Without Borders and Freedom House have also condemned the violence.|$|E
5|$|In late 2002 {{and early}} 2003, Bush urged the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>to</b> enforce Iraqi {{disarmament}} mandates, precipitating a diplomatic crisis.

5|$|The initial {{scale was}} {{developed}} by Saffir, a structural engineer, who in 1969 went on commission for the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>to</b> study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas. While performing the study, Saffir realized there was no simple scale for describing the likely effects of a hurricane. Mirroring {{the utility of the}} Richter magnitude scale in describing earthquakes, he devised a 1–5 scale based on wind speed that showed expected damage to structures. Saffir gave the scale to the NHC, and Simpson added the effects of storm surge and flooding.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} in India continued to deteriorate {{throughout the summer}} and autumn of 1947. Nevertheless, Ismay and Mountbatten had agreed that Ismay would remain in his position for only {{three to four months}} after partition. In December 1947, he left India to return to England. Shortly after his return, Ismay served briefly on the British delegation to the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>to</b> deal with the Kashmir issue. Ismay played only a limited role, as the Pakistanis suspected him of pro-Indian sympathies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the election, there was some {{violence}} and several incidents involving prominent opposition and media figures. In February, there was a grenade attack in Kigali which killed two people. Rwandan prosecutors blamed Kayumba Nyamwasa, a dissident General who had become a critic of Kagame. Nywamwasa fled to Johannesburg, South Africa, and in June he survived a shooting in the city. Nyamwasa alleged that it was an assassination attempt, a charge Rwanda denied. Days later, journalist Jean-Léonard Rugambage, who claimed to have uncovered the regime's responsibility in the attempted murder, was shot dead. In July, {{the vice president of the}} Democratic Green Party, André Kagwa Rwisereka, was beheaded in Butare. There is no concrete evidence linking Kagame with the attacks, but it was sufficient for the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>to</b> demand an investigation.|$|E

5|$|Nauru {{has used}} its {{position}} {{as a member of}} the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>to</b> gain financial support from both Taiwan (ROC) and China (PRC) by changing its recognition from one to the other under the One-China policy. On 21 July 2002, Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC, accepting $130million from the PRC for this action. In response, the ROC severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later. Nauru later re-established links with the ROC on 14 May 2005, and diplomatic ties with the PRC were officially severed on 31 May 2005. However, the PRC continues to maintain a representative office on Nauru.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Atlus and Lancarse for the Nintendo DS. It {{was released in}} Japan in 2009, and in North America in 2010. The game is the fourth entry in the Shin Megami Tensei series, which forms {{the core of the}} Megami Tensei franchise. The story follows a special task force sent by the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>to</b> investigate the Schwarzwelt, a spatial distortion that appears in Antarctica and threatens to engulf the world. Players take control of an unnamed protagonist, navigating the environments of the Schwarzwelt in first-person. Combat involves the player and recruited demons fighting against various enemies, with the protagonist having the option of talking with and recruiting enemies.|$|E

5|$|The British mandate in Palestine, {{where an}} Arab {{majority}} lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British {{with a similar}} problem to that of India. The matter was complicated by large numbers of Jewish refugees seeking {{to be admitted to}} Palestine following the Holocaust, while Arabs were opposed {{to the creation of a}} Jewish state. Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>to</b> solve. The UN General Assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.|$|E

Alongside the main protagonist, there are three main crew members on the Red Sprite: , the crew's leader; , an experienced American soldier who seeks rewards for his work; and , a knowledgeable Russian scientist. Other characters include , the Red Sprite's AI computer; the angel , who represents the forces of God; , a primordial mother goddess who controls the demons of the Schwarzwelt; and , an avatar of Lucifer who watches the protagonist's actions.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} community’s {{political stance}} towards Kampuchea had a severe {{impact on the}} Vietnamese economy, which was already wrecked by decades of continuous conflicts. The United States, which already had sanctions in place against Vietnam, convinced other countries of the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>to</b> deprive Vietnam and the People’s Republic of Kampuchea of much-needed funds by denying them membership to major international organisations such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In 1979 Japan stepped up the pressure by suspending all economic aid to Vietnam, and warned Vietnamese leaders that economic aid would only resume when Vietnam amended its policies towards Kampuchea, the Sino-Soviet rivalry {{and the problem of}} the boat people. Sweden, which was considered the staunchest supporter of Vietnam in the West, also considered reducing its commitments to the communist country as virtually every other country cancelled its aid.|$|E

5|$|The {{flooding}} on Mangaia persisted {{for nearly}} a week before finally subsiding. Once the waters receded, {{the full extent of}} damage was revealed. Although only minor structural damage was sustained, the agricultural sector received extensive losses. Nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of all the livestock perished. Following an assessment made by the Cook Islands National Disaster Management Council, it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses from Trina. International assistance from the United Nations was eventually requested on December12, allowing for relief funds from several agencies to be delivered to the area. Fears of food shortages also prompted the local government to begin stockpiling food should it become a necessary relief supply. A total of US$24,140 was committed in relief funds by New Zealand, Norway and the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>to</b> assist the Cook Islands in recovering from the storm. By late-December, an additional F$20,000 (US$11,000) was distributed by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat to the affected islands. In the months following Cyclone Trina, debris removal and cleanup was relatively slow, delaying efforts to replant crops lost in the floods. Food shortage issues became apparent in February 2002, prompting the IFRC to distribute food to all of Mangaia's residents.|$|E
5|$|Many of the RAAF's C-130s were redeployed to South Vietnam {{shortly before}} the end of the war in 1975. The rapid North Vietnamese advance during the Spring Offensive {{displaced}} hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians, and the Australian Government deployed a detachment of Hercules to Saigon in March 1975 as part of an international aid effort coordinated by the United States. This force, which was designated DetachmentS, had an average strength of seven C-130s and about one hundred air and ground crew, and was initially used to transport civilian refugees away from the front lines. After South Vietnamese soldiers were reported to have been transported alongside civilians, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam directed that the Hercules were to only carry humanitarian cargo. As the North Vietnamese advanced on Saigon, DetachmentS was moved to Bangkok in Thailand, but continued to fly into South Vietnam each day. Overall, DetachmentS had carried 1,100refugees and 900tonnes of supplies by the end of the war. On 4and 17April, aircraft of the detachment flew 271orphaned children to Bangkok as part of the US-led Operation Babylift. In late April, two of No.37 Squadron's C-130Es were assigned to the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>to</b> transport supplies throughout Southeast Asia; this force was designated DetachmentN. The C-130Es began operations on 3May, and were mainly used to fly supplies into Laos. The aircraft transported cargo between Thailand, Butterworth, Hong Kong and Singapore; by the time this mission ended in early June, the two Hercules had conducted 91sorties for the UN. Aircraft of DetachmentS evacuated Australian embassy personnel from Phnom Penh in Cambodia, as well as Saigon, {{shortly before the}}y fell to Khmer Rouge and North Vietnamese forces in April 1975, after which the force returned to Australia. DetachmentN also evacuated the Australian embassy in Vientiane, Laos, during early June 1975.|$|E
