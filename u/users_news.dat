In April 2016, it introduced an API for developers to build chatbots into Messenger, for uses such as news publishers building bots to give <b>users</b> <b>news</b> through the service, and in April 2017, it enabled the M virtual assistant for users in the U.S., which scans chats for keywords and suggests relevant actions, such as its payments system for users mentioning money.

40|$|With the {{popularity}} of mobile devices and the quick growth of the mobile Web, users can now browse news wherever they want; so, their news preferences are usually related to their geographical contexts. Consequently, many research efforts {{have been put on}} location-aware news recommendation, which recommends to <b>users</b> <b>news</b> happening nearest to them. Nevertheless, in a real-world context, users’ news preferences are not only related to their locations, but also strongly related to their personal interests. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hybrid method called location-aware personalized news recommendation with explicit semantic analysis (LP-ESA), which recommends news using both the users’ personal interests and their geographical contexts. However, the Wikipedia-based topic space in LP-ESA suffers from the problems of high dimensionality, sparsity, and redundancy, which greatly degrade the performance of LPESA. To address these problems, we further propose a novel method called LP-DSA to exploit recommendation-oriented deep neural networks to extract dense, abstract, low dimensional, and effective feature representations for <b>users,</b> <b>news,</b> and locations. Experimental results show that LP-ESA and LP-DSA both significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, LPDSA offers more effective (19 : 8 % to 179 : 6 % better) online news recommendation with much lower time cost (25 times quicker) than LP-ESA...|$|E

40|$|Media {{seems to}} have become more partisan, often {{providing}} a biased coverage of news catering to the interest of specific groups. It is therefore essential to identify credible information content that provides an objective narrative of an event. News communities such as digg, reddit, or newstrust offer recommendations, reviews, quality ratings, and further insights on journalistic works. However, there is a complex interaction between different factors in such online communities: fairness and style of reporting, language clarity and objectivity, topical perspectives (like political viewpoint), expertise and bias of community members, and more. This paper presents a model to systematically analyze the different interactions in a news community between <b>users,</b> <b>news,</b> and sources. We develop a probabilistic graphical model that leverages this joint interaction to identify 1) highly credible news articles, 2) trustworthy news sources, and 3) expert users who perform the role of "citizen journalists" in the community. Our method extends CRF models to incorporate real-valued ratings, as some communities have very fine-grained scales that cannot be easily discretized without losing information. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this paper is the first full-fledged analysis of credibility, trust, and expertise in news communities...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{recognized}} relevance and significant resources in-vested in making an online experience more personalized and enjoyable, there still remains {{a problem of}} personalization for {{a large number of}} online services in a presence of limited user information. In this paper, we recognize cold start prob-lem related to presentation of personalized articles on Ya-hoo news stream, and address it as a topic ranking problem. For active <b>users</b> <b>news</b> articles are commonly ranked accord-ing to their historical news topic preferences, while for new users article ranking is often based on the globally popular topics, which may result in diminished user experience. To mitigate this problem, we exploit demographic information to learn separate topic preferences for different age-gender user groups, and evaluate this simple, efficient approach on a large data set comprising more than 750, 000 users and their news stream activity logs from Yahoo homepage. In-terestingly, the results show that gender is more indicative of topic preferences than age, and confirm that demograph-ics carry a strong useful signal for personalizing content in a topic ranking setting, where by using age and gender infor-mation we obtained 5 % improvement in Kendall’s tau over the baseline predicting globally popular topics. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{participatory}} Web {{has enabled}} the ubiquitous and pervasive access of information, {{accompanied by an}} increase of speed and reach in information sharing. Data dissemination services such as news aggregators are expected to provide up-to-date, real-time information to the end <b>users.</b> <b>News</b> aggregators are in essence recommendation systems that filter and rank news stories in order to select the few that {{will appear on the}} users front screen at any time. One of the main challenges in such systems is to address the recency and latency problems, that is, to identify as soon as possible how important a news story is. In this work we propose an integrated framework that aims at predicting the importance of news items upon their publication with a focus on recent and highly popular news, employing resampling strategies, and at translating the result into concrete news rankings. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation using real-life datasets of the proposed framework as both a stand-alone system and when applied to news recommendations from Google News. Additionally, we propose and evaluate a combinatorial solution to the augmentation of official media recommendations with social information. Results show that the proposed approach complements and enhances the news rankings generated by state-of-the-art systems.
