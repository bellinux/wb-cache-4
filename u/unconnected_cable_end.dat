The invention is notable for {{a combination of the}} following features: a feed unit feeds the cable to be laid into the operating area of the solder unit and an insulation stripping unit for the <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> to be soldered, has at least one cutting element which cuts through the insulating material of the <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> to be soldered and can be moved towards the cable...|$|R
40|$|Stabilizing {{the phase}} delay of signals {{passing through a}} {{pressurizable}} coaxial cable is disclosed. Signals from an appropriate source at a selected frequency, e. g., 100 MHz, are sent through the controlled cable from a first <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> to a second <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> which, electrically, is open or heavily mismatched at 100 MHz, thereby reflecting 100 MHz signals {{back to the first}} <b>cable</b> <b>end.</b> Thereat, the phase difference between the reflected-back signals and the signals from the source is detected by a phase detector. The output of the latter is used to control the flow of gas to or from the cable, thereby controlling the cable pressure, which in turn affects the cable phase delay...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. At {{present the}} need of {{nondestructive}} testing of rope bridges state appears often. Modern maintenance trends using non-destructive checking allow to detect the state of these materials in service without breaking their integrity. From {{the point of view}} of so far used non-destructive testing methods the area of <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> is not accessible. The magnetic properties research of these materials and the subsequent design of new structures for scanning elements will enable non-destructive monitoring of the state of the ropes steel material of static constructions, especially their anchoring. The article aims to present the results from tracking of the magnetic flux around the <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> and signal runs from particular designed and investigated scanning elements placed above artificial defects created closely to the <b>cable</b> <b>end...</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>end</b> {{fittings}} are {{the pieces}} that tie the system together. The cable attaches into {{one side of}} the fitting, while the other side attaches to the post (frame structure). <b>Cable</b> <b>ends</b> may tension, or just attach to the frame, depending on the individual needs of the project. [...] The requirements needed to decide whether to use tensioning or non-tensioning fittings are generally dependent upon the manufacturer's system requirements, your local building codes, and ICC requirements. To determine the type of <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> fittings needed, you'll need to know the distance you expect a single piece of cable to run without stopping, and the amount of tensioning ability of the fitting you expect to use. Individual manufacturers will help you to determine the rest.|$|R
40|$|Cable {{guardrail}} {{systems have}} been increasing in popularity in recent years due to several perceived benefits over the commonly used W-beam guardrail. A non-proprietary design was desired {{as an alternative to}} the many proprietary designs available. A non-proprietary, high-tension <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> terminal was necessary to accompany the non-proprietary, high-tension cable guardrail system under development. The objective of this research project was to develop design recommendations for a non-proprietary, high-tension <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> terminal. An analysis of several <b>cable</b> guardrail <b>end</b> terminals was undertaken to identify any common features that may prove to be beneficial or detrimental to end terminal designs. Next, a study of the non-proprietary low-tension system was conducted to determine the cause of vehicle instabilities in full-scale testing. Since the high-tension and low-tension <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> terminal designs are similar, it is likely that any issues with the low-tension design will also be evident in testing of the high-tension design. LS-DYNA modeling of current cable terminal anchor hardware was then accomplished and compared to bogie testing results. The anchor model proved to be sufficiently accurate to preliminarily analyze alternative cable anchor designs. A final, optimized, high-tension cable anchor design was produced along with alternative terminal post recommendations for continuing development of the non-proprietary, high-tension <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> terminal.

50|$|A D-sub {{contains}} {{two or more}} parallel rows of pins or sockets usually surrounded by a D-shaped metal shield that provides mechanical support, ensures correct orientation, and may screen against electromagnetic interference. The part containing pin contacts is called the male connector or plug, while that containing socket contacts is called the female connector or socket. The socket's shield fits tightly inside the plug's shield. Panel mounted connectors usually have threaded nuts that accept screws on the <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> connector cover that are used for locking the connectors together and offering mechanical strain relief. Occasionally the nuts may be found on a <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> connector if {{it is expected to}} connect to another <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> (see the male DE-9 pictured). When screened cables are used, the shields are connected to the overall screens of the cables. This creates an electrically continuous screen covering the whole cable and connector system.|$|R

40|$|Cable-stayed bridges {{generally}} having common defects such as {{excessive vibration}} due to wind action, corrosion and fatigue {{occurred at the}} cables supporting member. This study presents two different approaches for the demonstration of the damping effect due to wind action on cable-stayed bridge. The fi rst approach uses a simplifi ed analysis method to study the reaction force at the <b>cable</b> <b>end.</b> A beam element was adopted for modelling the cables and a plate element for modelling the bridge’s deck. The second approach {{is based on the}} selected damper system applied at the <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> to determine the reaction response at the bridge models. Two methods are presented in this report with the consideration of bridge geometric effect. The effect of pretension of the cable and the exact treatment of cable sag with the cable weight is ignored. A numerical calculation has been carried out in determining the nominal transverse wind load, the nominal longitudinal wind load on deck and the nominal longitudinal wind load on cables in accordance to the current code of practice. The results generated from MIDAS Civil software have been used for comparing the analysis results. The stiffness coeffi cient for the selected rubber damper type was being modelled at the <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> to examine the effect of nominal and combined wind action at critical locations. The effectiveness of using the rubber damper to suppress the effects of wind was investigated through superposition of these rubber dampers at the maximum reactions at the <b>cable</b> <b>end.</b> It was found that the damper system adapted on the cable-stays has signifi cant infl uence on suppressing the action due to wind...|$|R

50|$|Cable {{shielding}} may {{be required}} in order to improve a Cat 6 cable's performance in high electromagnetic interference (EMI) environments. This shielding reduces the corrupting effect of EMI on the cable's data. Shielding is typically maintained from one <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> to the other using a drain wire that runs through the cable alongside the twisted pairs. The shield's electrical connection to the chassis on each end is made through the jacks. The requirement for ground connections at both <b>cable</b> <b>ends</b> creates the possibility that a ground loop may result if one of the networked chassis is at different instantaneous electrical potential with respect to its mate. This undesirable situation may compel currents to flow between chassis through the network cable shield, and these currents may in turn induce detrimental noise in the signal being carried by the cable.|$|R

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} {{detection and}} localisation is a well-established off-line tool for diag- nosing medium voltage cables [1 - 3]. For on-line application {{a number of}} new problems have to be solved, not only related to sensor coupling and high noise levels. In this pa- per a few additional consequences are discussed. The electric field in a belted cable is elliptical. The amount of field eccentricity influences PD patterns, due both to the PD excitation itself and to the coupling and propagation of the signal to the cable conduc- tors. Further, the impedances seen by the propagating pulses at the <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> can vary, depending on the substation equipment. Therefore, localisation techniques based on re- flectometry become unreliable, and signal detection at both <b>cable</b> <b>ends</b> is preferred. This implicates the need of synchronisation of the two set-ups and a communication channel between them. This paper discusses the feasibility to use the cable under test for these purposes...|$|R
