2500|$|Structural {{violence}} is often embedded in longstanding social structures, ubiquitous throughout the globe, that are regularized by persistent institutions and regular experience with them. These social structures seem so normal {{in our understanding}} of the world that they are almost invisible, but inequality in resource access, political power, education, healthcare, and legal standing are all possible perpetrators of structural violence. Structural violence occurs [...] "whenever persons are harmed, maimed, or killed by poverty and unjust social, political, and economic institutions, systems, or structures" [...] Structural violence can contribute to worse health outcomes through either harming or killing victims, just like armed violence can have these effects. This type of <b>unintended</b> <b>harm</b> perpetuated by structural violence progressively promotes misery and hunger that eventually results in death, among other effects. Ehrlich and Ehrlich reported in 1970 that between 10 and 20 million of the 60 million annual deaths across the globe result from starvation and malnutrition. Their report also estimated that structural violence was responsible for the end of one billion lives between 1948 and 1967 in the third world.|$|E

Although {{debates about the}} validity or ethical consequences of epidemiological variables are familiar for specific variables (e. g., ethnicity), these issues apply more widely.

The Beers Criteria are {{a valuable}} tool for clinical care and quality improvement but may be misinterpreted and implemented in ways that cause <b>unintended</b> <b>harms.</b> This article describes the intended role of the 2015 American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria and provides guidance on how patients, clinicians, health systems, and payors should use them. A key theme underlying these recommendations is to use common sense and clinical judgment in applying the 2015 AGS Beers Criteria and to remain mindful of nuances in the criteria. The criteria serve as a "warning light" to identify medications that have an unfavorable balance of benefits and harms in many older adults, particularly when compared with pharmacological and nonpharmacological alternatives. However, there are situations in which use of medications included in the criteria can be appropriate. As such, the 2015 AGS Beers Criteria work best no t only when they identify potentially inappropriate medications, but also when they educate clinicians and patients about the reasons those medications are included and the situations in which their use may {{be more or less}} problematic. The criteria are designed to support, rather than supplant, good clinical judgment...|$|R

40|$|Most {{punishment}} theories acknowledge {{neither the}} full extent of the harms which punishment risks, nor the caring practices which punishment entails. Consequently, I shall argue, punishment in most of its current conceptualizations is inconsistent with treating offenders as equals qua persons. The nature of criminal punishment, and of our interactions with offenders in punishment decision-making and delivery, risks causing harm to offenders. Harm is normalized when central to definitions of punishment, desensitizing us to <b>unintended</b> <b>harms</b> and obscuring caring practices. Offenders may be partially silenced and excluded by mainstream criminal justice practices which limit interaction between offenders and practitioners. When we ignore significant harms, or silence and exclude, we treat others as passive nonsubjects. This partially objectifies offenders, and is inconsistent with treatment as equals. Penal theories employing harm-centred and harm-normalizing definitions of punishment can provide few resources to help practitioners either avoid, or recognize and respond to, harms. Care ethics, by contrast, motivates the avoidance of harm, ongoing inclusive engagement, and respectful interaction with others. I argue that defining punishment without presupposing harm facilitates the identification of morally problematic harms, and recognition of caring practices. I offer a principled argument, and political and pragmatic supplementary arguments, for responding to offenders without intentional harm and with care. Principles drawn from care ethics can help to strengthen mainstream criminal practices by structuring decision-making and action. Bottom-up alternative criminal justice practices share some values with these proposed guiding principles, allowing a partial test of the principles. I consider examples of restorative justice practices, therapeutic jurisprudence, community justice and other problem-solving court practices, in addition to considering how well mainstream punishment practices measure up to these principles. My analysis illuminates the strengths and weaknesses of the principles, and how they might contribute to securing treatment as equals for offenders in mainstream practices...|$|R

Efficacy evidence is variable across other settings and much is unknown including mechanisms of action, and optimal screening or implementation approaches [2, 3]. Despite this, implementation outside of primary care has had much attention including in non-health settings, parti-cularly in the UK [4 - 6]. This study aimed to discuss, and present for debate, chal-lenges and opportunities relating to alcohol SBI in new set-tings from published and previously unpublished studies of recent SBI implementation in Scotland and England. Material and methods A narrative review was conducted of evidence from diverse studies including research into training and imple-mentation of alcohol SBI outside of primary care (accident and emergency; antenatal; social care; community/mental health; homelessness and multidisciplinary teams). Results The challenges and opportunities can be conceptualised in terms of questions that should be asked before consid-ering implementation of alcohol brief interventions in a new setting: (1) Is there a need for SBI delivery in this service? (2) How are practitioners currently addressing alcohol use- how when, where does SBI fit in? (3) Will SBI work/do harm in this setting? (4) Will SBI be per-ceived as legitimate by practitioners and acceptable to service-users? (5) Will practitioners {{have the ability to}} deliver SBI? (6) What support will be needed? (7) What will support routine implementation of SBI in this setting? Conclusion Careful consideration should be given to every aspect of the design, purpose, context and evaluation of alcohol SBI in any given setting preferably by robust stepwise research prior to widespread implementation. Avoiding assumptions, including about screening methods and intervention goals, is likely to be important for effective-ness, implementation and avoiding <b>unintended</b> <b>harms...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Poly {{drug use}} often {{carries with it}} more risk than use of a single drug, due to an {{increase}} in side effects, and drug synergy. The potentiating effect of one drug on another is sometimes considerable and here the licit drugs and medicines - such as alcohol, nicotine and antidepressants - have to be considered in conjunction with the controlled psychoactive substances. The risk level will depend on the dosage level of both substances. If the drugs taken are illegal, they have a chance of being mixed (also known as [...] "cutting") with other substances which dealers are reported to do to increase the perceived quantity when selling to others to increase their returns. This is particularly common with powdered drugs such as cocaine or MDMA which can be mixed with relative ease by adding another white powdery substance to the drug. This cumulative effect can lead to further <b>unintended</b> <b>harm</b> to health dependent on what is being covertly added. Concerns also exist about a number of pharmacological pairings: alcohol and cocaine increase cardiovascular toxicity; alcohol or depressant drugs, when taken with opioids, lead to an increased risk of overdose; and opioids or cocaine taken with ecstasy or amphetamines also result in additional acute toxicity. Benzodiazepines are notorious for causing death when mixed with other CNS depressants such as opioids, alcohol, or barbiturates.|$|E

40|$|Background Community engagement, {{incorporating}} {{elements of}} the broader concepts of public and stakeholder engagement, is increasingly promoted globally, including for health research conducted in developing countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, community engagement needs and challenges are arguably intensified for studies involving gay, bisexual and other {{men who have sex}} with men, where male same-sex sexual interactions are often highly stigmatised and even illegal. This paper contextualises, describes and interprets the discussions and outcomes of an international meeting held at the Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust in Kilifi, Kenya, in November 2013, to critically examine the experiences with community engagement for studies involving {{men who have sex with}} men. Discussion We discuss the ethically charged nature of the language used for men who have sex with men, and of working with ‘representatives’ of these communities, as well as the complementarity and tensions between a broadly public health approach to community engagement, and a more rights based approach. We highlight the importance of researchers carefully considering which communities to engage with, and the goals, activities, and indicators of success and potential challenges for each. We suggest that, given the <b>unintended</b> <b>harms</b> that can emerge from community engagement (including through labelling, breaches in confidentiality, increased visibility and stigma, and threats to safety), representatives of same-sex populations should be consulted from the earliest possible stage, and that engagement activities should be continuously revised in response to unfolding realities. Engagement should also include less vocal and visible men who have sex with men, and members of other communities with influence on the research, and on research participants and their families and friends. Broader ethics support, advice and research into studies involving men who have sex with men is needed to ensure that ethical challenges – including but not limited to those related to community engagement – are identified and addressed. Summary Underlying challenges and dilemmas linked to stigma and discrimination of men who have sex with men in Africa raise special responsibilities for researchers. Community engagement is an important way of identifying responses to these challenges and responsibilities but itself presents important ethical challenges. </p...|$|R

She points out that although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship.

On average, 11 % of each drug round was spent dealing with interruptions. There were one or more interruptions in two-thirds of the rounds studied (average 2. 61 interruptions per round), with a mean duration of 1 minute per interruption. The interruptions came from doctors (21 %), other nurses (17 %), patients (11 %), telephone enquiries (8 %), relatives (3 %) or were initiated by the nurse conducting the round (21 %). This pattern contradicts the subjective impressions of nurses in previous questionnaire studies, but it was notable that the longest individual interruptions were from conversations with patients (mean 249 seconds) and phone calls (mean 212 seconds). The data confirm the frequency of interruptions, and their potential as a safety hazard.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a literature review and two qualitative research papers that explore the under-researched and under-reported topic of iatrogenesis (<b>unintended</b> <b>harm).</b> There seems no clear theory within Counselling Psychology which encompasses {{the notion of}} iatrogenesis. Therefore, this research draws upon relevant theories from other domains. The research in this thesis is underpinned by Merton’s (1936, 1968, 1972, 2016) sociological theory of unintended consequences, which supports a detailed exploration {{of what happens when}} two people meet in the social context of the consultation room. Each of the three studies which form this research will explore a different aspect of iatrogenesis. This is intended to support an exploration of <b>unintended</b> <b>harm</b> from various epistemological and methodological positions, and different analytical perspectives. For a conceptual consistency across the research, harm is defined as, “a negative effect [that] must be relatively lasting, which excludes from consideration transient effects [...] . [such as in-session anxiety or between session sadness, and] must be directly attributable to, or a function of, the character or quality of the therapeutic experience or intervention” (Strupp, Hadley, & Gomes-Schwartz, 1977, pp. 91 - 92). The theoretical grounding of the Literature Review is Merton’s (1936) theory of the Unanticipated consequences of purposive social action, which I have used to explore the dilemmas involved when the unintended consequences of actions expected to engender helpful change, can result in an unexpected or unexpected outcome.

To support this evaluation, some hospitals have in-corporated a basic clinical decision sup-port system into the computerized physi-cian order entry (CPOE) system. The discontinuation of a medication, howev-er, may have important consequences as well. A tapering scheme may be neces-sary, the loss of enzyme induction or in-hibition may require dosage adjustment of other medications, or electrolyte dis-turbances may occur. Ignoring these con-sequences may lead to an adverse drug withdrawal event. 2 To our knowledge, there is hardly any literature about medi-cation surveillance when a prescription is stopped, even when the prescription is involved in a drug-drug interaction.
