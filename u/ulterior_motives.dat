5|$|Even before Adolf Hitler {{seized control}} of Germany in 1933, the {{problems}} with the Minority Treaties were evident. Various European governments continued to abuse minorities, the latter loudly protested, their complaints were exploited by interested parties with <b>ulterior</b> <b>motives,</b> and the League interfered as little as possible. The system suffered an apparent death blow with Poland's rejection of its treaty in 1934.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of season two's nineteenth episode, the writers had decided Helen's fate. Originally, the {{character}} {{was going to die}} on her wedding night, but the creative team felt they could use her more in the mythology. Gough explains the idea Helen still had Clark's blood, she knew his secret, and her relationship with Lex was too good to write off. The creative team kept Helen's true motivations a secret to Vaugier, which the actress enjoyed because it allowed her to play the character as if there were no <b>ulterior</b> <b>motives.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Hata {{argued that}} the {{recently}} released monologue of Emperor Hirohito, the former Emperor's recollection of wartime Japan which he recorded shortly after World War II, had likely been created {{to prove to the}} United States that he was not involved in war crimes and consequently Hata theorized that an English language translation must have also been drawn up at the same time, a theory which was mocked by right-wing scholars who felt the monologue was created as a simple historical record without <b>ulterior</b> <b>motives.</b> In 1997 the English language draft was discovered.|$|E

5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which {{was made possible by}} the repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more {{power in the hands of}} the governor and accused Chandler of <b>ulterior</b> <b>motives</b> in supporting it.|$|E

Archer declines, {{but he soon}} learns that the foreman had <b>ulterior</b> <b>motives,</b> since he has ordered three warships to overpower Enterprise and enslave his crew. Kessick claims {{to know how to}} escape the mine, but asks for Archer's help in return for guiding the Starfleet officers. Archer reluctantly agrees, and Kessick leads him and Tucker through the mine's sewage removal system. However, the group is soon detected in a conduit, and the foreman floods the system with plasma in an effort to kill them. They narrowly escape being killed, but quickly {{fall into the hands of}} the mine's security forces.|$|E
5|$|At Velfarre, she was {{introduced}} to her future producer, Max Matsuura, through a friend. After hearing Hamasaki sing karaoke, Matsuura offered her a recording deal, but Hamasaki suspected <b>ulterior</b> <b>motives</b> and turned the offer down. He persisted and succeeded in recruiting her for the Avex label in the following year. Hamasaki started vocal training, but skipped most of her classes after finding her instructors to be too rigid and the classes dull. When she confessed this to Matsuura, he sent her to New York to train her vocals under another method. During her foreign sojourn, Hamasaki frequently corresponded with Matsuura and impressed him with her style of writing. On her return to Japan, he suggested that she try writing her own lyrics.|$|E

Learning that Dario had the same symptoms before he died, Jonathan suspects that Dio poisoned both of them; Dio plans to stop Jonathan from exposing this by killing him with the stone mask. When he tests the mask on a beggar beforehand, it instead turns the beggar into a vampire, who dies due to exposure to sunlight. While investigating the poison, Jonathan befriends the street thug Robert E. O. Speedwagon and learns that Dio acquired it from Wang Chan, a black market merchant. Jonathan confronts Dio, who uses George's blood and the mask to become a vampire. The Joestar estate burns to the ground during the ensuing battle, but Jonathan and Dio survive.|$|E
5|$|Ruby is {{a fictional}} {{character}} on The CW Television Network's Supernatural portrayed mainly by actresses Katie Cassidy and Genevieve Cortese. Created by the writers {{to expand on}} the characterization of demons within the series, she first appears in the third season, wherein she assists series protagonists Sam and Dean Winchester in fighting her fellow demons. By the fourth season, she has won Sam's trust and begins training him to kill demons with his psychic powers, though Dean remains fearful of <b>ulterior</b> <b>motives.</b> The character departs the series {{at the end of}} the fourth season. Though the fans at first reacted negatively towards Cortese replacing Cassidy after the third season, Cortese and creator Eric Kripke felt that they became more accepting as the fourth season progressed. While fan response to the character was mixed overall, critical reception was generally negative. A common criticism was underwhelming performances by Cassidy and Cortese.|$|E
5|$|Athena was the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' {{mentor and}} ally {{throughout}} the Greek {{era in the}} series. In Chains of Olympus, Athena initially tasked Kratos to find Helios as {{in the absence of}} light, the god Morpheus had caused many of the gods to fall into a deep slumber. In God of War, she gave Kratos the mission of killing Ares, as Zeus had forbidden divine involvement, and was instrumental in allowing Kratos to become the new God of War. Although she begged Kratos to stop his second quest for the Ambrosia of Asclepius in the God of War comic series and lied to him about his brother Deimos in Ghost of Sparta, Athena was still sympathetic towards Kratos even after he renounced the gods and was betrayed by Zeus in God of War II. Athena died trying to protect Zeus from Kratos, and was resurrected and elevated to a new level of understanding in God of War III. With <b>ulterior</b> <b>motives,</b> Athena became Kratos' ally once more and guided him to the Flame of Olympus surrounding Pandora's Box, which allowed Kratos to kill Zeus and end the reign of Mount Olympus.|$|E

5|$|Carter J. Burke (Paul Reiser) {{is special}} {{projects}} director of Weyland-Yutani Corporation's Special Services Division {{and the primary}} antagonist of Aliens. After telling Ellen Ripley about her daughter's death and hearing her account of the Nostromo incident, Burke uses the information to have LV-426's colonists rendezvous with the Derelict and trigger an Alien outbreak. He persuades her to join the Colonial marine expedition, to destroy (not extract) specimens, as an adviser in exchange for her regaining her flight license. Burke accompanies the squad aboard Sulaco to safeguard the company's investment in the terraforming colony. His <b>ulterior</b> <b>motives</b> are discovered by Ripley; his rationale is that the Aliens are an important species they cannot exterminate and the facility is a significant investment. Burke tries to have Ripley and Newt impregnated by imprisoned facehuggers, but the Colonial Marines intervene. Although most of the survivors press for Burke's execution, Ripley protests; the Aliens cut the power and use an architectural-design flaw {{to break into the}} room. He escapes, leaving {{the rest of the group}} to die, but is confronted by an Alien in the locked medical lab and his screams are heard by those outside.|$|E
5|$|The Actor's Children was {{released}} with enthusiasm and positive reviews in trade publications. The Moving Picture World reviews would be favorable and without much criticism, even calling the acting convincing. A more honest review in The New York Dramatic Mirror {{was written by}} a reviewer who {{was pleased with the}} production, but offered criticism about the production's weaker aspects. The reviewer found there to be too much emphasis on the unimportant parts and a lack of emotion from the actors, and the child actors performance was faulted by repeatedly looking at the camera. Critical reception of the film may not have been entirely neutral for a number of reasons. Edwin Thanhouser was a well-liked gentleman who had many friends in the Patents Company that likely wanted him to succeed. Furthermore, writers in the magazines hoped that Independents would succeed and challenge the Patents Company's stranglehold on the industry. Also, film critics and reviewers of the era would balance the negativity of even the worst films with some favorable aspects. Even without any <b>ulterior</b> <b>motives,</b> the film may have been worthy of a favorable review.|$|E
5|$|The turn of {{the decade}} brought Scorsese's {{black-and-white}} Raging Bull (cowritten by Schrader); an acknowledged masterpiece—the American Film Institute ranks it as the greatest American film of the 1980s and the fourth greatest of all time—it is also a retreat, telling {{a story of a}} boxer's moral self-destruction that recalls in both theme and visual ambience noir dramas such as Body and Soul (1947) and Champion (1949). From 1981, the popular Body Heat, written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan, invokes a different set of classic noir elements, this time in a humid, erotically charged Florida setting; its success confirmed the commercial viability of neo-noir, {{at a time when the}} major Hollywood studios were becoming increasingly risk averse. The mainstreaming of neo-noir is evident in such films as Black Widow (1987), Shattered (1991), and Final Analysis (1992). Few neo-noirs have made more money or more wittily updated the tradition of the noir double-entendre than Basic Instinct (1992), directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas. The film also demonstrates how neo-noir's polychrome palette can reproduce many of the expressionistic effects of classic black-and-white noir. Poison Ivy (1992) makes use of similar devices executed in Basic Instinct, including a shady, seductive femme-fatale with <b>ulterior</b> <b>motives.</b>|$|E

Andy is then {{promoted}} to Regional Manager and works {{hard to make a}} good impression on Robert, and asks Dwight to be his number two. Pam and Jim are expecting their second child, Phillip, {{at the start of the}} season, to coincide with Fischer's real life pregnancy. Angela is pregnant with her first son, also named Philip, with State Senator Robert Lipton (although it is implied that Dwight Schrute is actually the child's biological father). Darryl starts falling for new warehouse foreman Val. Dwight is tasked with traveling to Tallahassee, Florida in order to assist Sabre Special Projects Manager Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) in launching a chain of retail stores, along with Jim, Ryan, Stanley, Erin, and new office temp Cathy Simms. Cathy is also revealed to have <b>ulterior</b> <b>motives</b> for the trip, as she intends to seduce Jim, but fails. Robert later kills the retail store project, and Erin decides to stay in Florida as an elderly woman's live-in helper. Andy goes to Florida and wins back Erin, but this allows Nellie to claim the manager position as her own. Robert tells Andy that he has been demoted back to a salesman, but he refuses to accept the news, which causes him to be fired. Andy becomes motivated to begin a Dunder Mifflin comeback and joins with former CFO, David Wallace, to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre, putting Sabre completely out of business and giving Andy the manager position once again.|$|E
