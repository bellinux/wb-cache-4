5|$|The Playford family {{heritage}} can {{be traced}} back to 1759, when a baby boy was left at the door of a house in Barnby Dun, Yorkshire, England, with a note to christen the child 'Thomas Playford'. The occupants of the house, who were to raise the child, were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for the deed. The child grew <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> simple farmer in the village, and had a son in 1795 who he christened 'Thomas Playford'. The tradition of naming the firstborn son in the family in this way has continued since.|$|E
5|$|The 1994 {{national}} {{convention of the}} Progress Party of Norway was held from 15 April to 17 April at the hotel Bolkesjø Turisthotell in Bolkesjø, Telemark. It was originally set <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> normal convention with 157 delegates in a non-election year, but because of mounting antagonism between a traditionalist and a libertarian faction, it became clear some months before the conventions that personal positions could be at stake. The party leader seat, held by Carl I. Hagen since 1978, was up for re-election. The deputy leaders Ellen Wibe and Hans J. Røsjorde was not up for election until 1995, but there were talks about forming a {{motion of no confidence}} against Wibe. The political disagreements roughly corresponded to a cleavage between two factions.|$|E

5|$|Khal Drogo, delirious from an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} chest wound inflicted by Mago, falls from his saddle, {{a sign of weakness}} among the Dothraki. Daenerys takes Drogo into her tent and sends for Mirri Maz Duur to help him. However, Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys that they should leave now because the Dothraki only respect the physically strong. He explains that, if Drogo dies, Qotho and the other bloodriders will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill her and her unborn child to prevent Drogo's son from growing <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> rival. Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband, even when Mirri tells Daenerys that she cannot save him and instead advises giving Drogo a quick, clean death. In desperation, Daenerys encourages Mirri to use blood magic despite Mirri's warning about the consequences of such a spell, that only death can pay for life. Mirri brings Drogo's horse into the tent, slits its throat, orders everyone to leave, and warns that none must enter during the spell. Qotho, shocked at what Daenerys has done, tries to stop the spell, but Mormont kills him to prevent interference. Daenerys then goes into premature labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives help her, owing to their belief that she is cursed. In desperation, Mormont carries Daenerys into Drogo's tent to seek Mirri's help.|$|E
5|$|The Chronicle of Melrose reports Clement's death {{under the}} year 1258. Clement's legacy {{was to be}} remembered as the restorer of the diocese of Dunblane and the builder of its cathedral. Thus for future generations, Clement became the father-figure of the see. Clement was later commemorated as a saint, though there is no record of formal canonisation. He was commemorated on 19 March, meaning that was almost {{certainly}} believed to have been the date of his death. Clement's death was also noted by Walter Bower, a Lowland Scottish historian writing in the 1440s, who included the following obituary: Clement bishop of Dunblane died, that outstanding member of the Order of Preachers, a man most eloquent in translating various tongues, powerful in speech and action in the sight of God and of men. He found the cathedral church of his diocese reduced by the neglect of his predecessors to such a state of decay that the divine offices were celebrated in it scarcely three times a week, as if it were some rural chapel. He built it <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hallowed sanctuary, enriched it with lands and possessions, and increased its prestige by adding prebends and canonries. Such flattering sentiments had even been expressed during Clement's lifetime. In 1250, the General Chapter of the Dominican Order met in London, and decreed that: we grant to Friar Clement of our Order, a bishop of Scotland, after his death, one mass throughout the Order by every friar whomsoever is a priest. Although there survives a sermon almost certainly written by him, Clement was also credited with being a prolific translator and writing four books (including a hagiography of St Dominic), all of which are now lost.|$|E
