25|$|In December 1991, the {{two governments}} were again in talks to extend the {{withdrawal}} of American forces for three years but this broke down as the United States refused to spell out in detail their withdrawal plans or say if nuclear weapons were kept on base; nuclear weapons were forbidden on Philippine soil. Finally, on December 27, President Corazon Aquino, who fought to delay the pullout to cushion the country's battered economy, issued a formal notice for the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> {{what has been the}} U.S.'s largest overseas defense facility after Clark Air Base was closed, by the end of 1992.|$|E
500|$|Ali Salman, {{the head}} of Al Wefaq, said the party would {{continue}} to demand reform. Abdul Jalil Khalil, an Al Wefaq member of parliament, described the raid as [...] "real terrorism. Whoever took the decision to attack the protest was aiming to kill." [...] He also [...] said the casualty number is proportially large given {{the small size of}} Bahrain's population and added: [...] "After what happened today, people are asking <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> parliament. Quit the government." [...] Other Al Wefaq MP's and lawyers made a criminal complaint against senior officials of the Ministry of Interior, including its minister, the agents, the commander of public security forces, his assistants and the various heads of security zones.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{the failure}} of the Iraqi {{government}} to make reforms, McConnell said the following on Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer: [...] "The Iraqi government is a huge disappointment. Republicans overwhelmingly feel disappointed about the Iraqi government. I read just this week that a significant number of the Iraqi parliament want to vote to ask <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> I want to assure you, Wolf, if they vote to ask <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> we'll be glad to comply with their request." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Wait," [...] said Madame. [...] "Wait. They {{will not}} do {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> You are only dirty foreigners, mes braves. At the most they will ask <b>us</b> only <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their pure country." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{darkness}} fell on 30 March, {{the front}} line troops received the order to retreat and an infantryman concluded: [...] "none of <b>us</b> sorry <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> behind forever, we hope, a nightmare of a most terrible nature." ...|$|R

[...] McCain responded, [...] "I think it's obvious {{that we would have}} to leave because â€“ if it was an elected government of Iraq...." ...|$|E
2500|$|After six albums {{that spanned}} Petra's highest peak {{and ended with}} the band in its lowest valley to date, the band and its label parted ways. [...] "Their {{interests}} were starting to go in other directions, so {{it was time for}} <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and find a label that's interested in rebuilding the fact that we still exist," [...] Schlitt said.|$|E
2500|$|Because of leakage {{of water}} into the holds of wooden ships, {{they had to be}} {{regularly}} pumped out. The frequency and monotony of this task inspired the singing of many shanties. One design of pump worked very similarly to the brake windlass, while another, the Downton pump, was turned by handles attached to large wheels. Examples: [...] "Strike The Bell," [...] "Fire Down Below," [...] "South Australia", and [...] "One More Day." [...] An example of special note is [...] "Leave Her, Johnny, Leave Her" [...] (also known as [...] "Time for <b>Us</b> <b>to</b> <b>Leave</b> Her"), which was generally sung during the last round of pumping the ship dry once it was tied up in port, prior to the crew leaving the ship {{at the end of the}} voyage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because the {{solution}} of such matters is a hobby of his," [...] Wrayson answered. [...] "It was he who saw your sister and I come out from the flat that morning. It was he who warned <b>us</b> both <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Edith, Edith! By the Virgin, I implore you to {{come back}} with <b>us,</b> and <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> this wicked man!" [...] cried Mary. [...] "Dear sister, you would not break our father's heart, nor bring his gray head in dishonor to the grave! Come back Edith, come back and all is well." ...|$|R
60|$|Seeing this, no hope {{remained}} for <b>us</b> but <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the ship, if possible, with the passengers and such of our men as were still alive, trusting to Providence not only <b>to</b> bring <b>us</b> safe away, but <b>to</b> keep <b>us</b> all in that desolate country amongst {{a strange and}} savage people.|$|R
2500|$|According to Moving Behind Woman, who {{was about}} 14 {{at the time of}} the Washita attack, Black Kettle's wife Medicine Woman stood outside the lodge for a long time. She was angry that the camp was not moving that night, saying, [...] "I don't like this delay, we could have moved long ago. The Agent sent word for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> at once. It seems we are crazy and deaf, and cannot hear." [...] Black Hawk's brother White Shield (also known as Gentle Horse) had a vision of a wolf wounded on the right side of its head {{mourning}} its little ones which had been scattered and killed by a powerful enemy. He tried to persuade Black Kettle to move camp immediately, but was unsuccessful. [...] But five of Black Kettle's children (four daughters and a son) moved to the camp of Black Kettle's nephew Whirlwind, which was ten miles downriver (five miles straight-line distance).|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't believe Thursday {{will ever}} desert, and Hetty likes <b>us</b> too well <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> in the lurch; but suppose those typesetters take a notion to flit?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With you I go!" [...] {{he cried}} in a {{contained}} voice. [...] "With you, who know {{so many of}} <b>us.</b> I want <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> this land--my people [...] . and him--there!" ...|$|R
50|$|Spykman {{thought that}} it was in <b>U.S.</b> {{interests}} <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Germany strong after World War II {{in order to be able}} to counter Russia's power. Strategically, there was no difference between Germany dominating all the way to the Urals, or Russia controlling all the way to Germany; both scenarios were equally threatening <b>to</b> the <b>U.S.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is still}} all-powerful here, however," [...] I replied. [...] "So it behooves <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> {{at the first}} moment that appears at all propitious." ...|$|E
60|$|But I {{would have}} sacrificed {{the life of}} every man of us rather than desert a single red man, much less the lion-hearted hero who begged <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him.|$|E

5000|$|His stay in England {{had left}} him disillusioned with European culture. He wrote to his friend Bysack from France: [...] If there be any one among <b>us</b> anxious <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> a name behind him, and not pass away into {{oblivion}} like a brute, let him devote himself to his mother-tongue. That is his legitimate sphere his proper element.|$|R
50|$|His work {{made him}} a marked man {{in the eyes of}} the authorities, and he was forced <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> gain employment, <b>leaving</b> his wife and four {{children}} in Ireland.|$|R
25|$|In December 1941 the United States {{government}} {{estimated that}} there were 4,000 Germans living in Colombia. There were some Nazi agitators in Colombia, such as Barranquilla businessman Emil Prufurt. Colombia invited Germans {{who were on the}} <b>U.S.</b> blacklist <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> SCADTA, a Colombian-German air transport corporation which was established by German expatriates in 1919, was the first commercial airline in the western hemisphere.|$|R
6000|$|... "Does King Khatsua want <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> his country, then?" [...] Granville Kelmscott asked, with a {{distinct}} tremor in his voice, for the great chief and his followers looked decidedly hostile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Colonel Colby or Captain Dale never ordered <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> {{the snow}} outdoors," [...] added Fred, {{and at this}} there was a snicker from {{among a number of}} the cadets who were gathered.|$|E
6000|$|... "So that's what's a-ranklin' in your heart, is it? You want <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> do you? There's {{too many}} on us. You {{want us to}} pack up and swim. Is that it? Come!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do you suppose," [...] {{he said in}} a low tone, [...] "that Staunton or any of <b>us</b> {{are meant}} <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> this place alive? I am afraid our friends below know too well what they are doing." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{band was}} a lot of fun. I think there was great rapport between the people in it. And none of <b>us</b> wanted <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> We were always getting sort of offers from other bands for much more money than we were making with Woody, and it was always like if you left, you were a rat. You were really letting down the team.|$|R
6000|$|... "Again and yet again, {{until the}} time comes for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the earth for ever. Of this, indeed, I am sure, for that {{knowledge}} {{was part of the}} secret wisdom of my people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not wonder!" [...] exclaimed Patience, [...] "that {{she has no}} face to see us. She {{that has}} been like a child or a sister to <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> us thus! O my brother!" ...|$|E
60|$|It behoves <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Kit for a while, {{thoughtful}} and expectant, and {{to follow the}} fortunes of little Nell; resuming the thread of the narrative {{at the point where}} it was left, some chapters back.|$|E
