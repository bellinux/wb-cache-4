25|$|Under {{its unique}} {{macro-economic}} and political environment, the China {{has adopted a}} special telecommunications policy and strategy for telecommunications reform. As a fundamental and strategic industry, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) of China has monopolized telecommunication operations {{for more than four}} decades. Recognizing its incapability of monopolizing the huge market and of meeting increasing demand, China launched a telecommunications reform that has been aimed at full competition. As the result, the basic telecommunication market advanced from a monopoly to a duopoly, and it is now being extended to pluralistic competition. In 1994, China <b>Unicom</b> was formed and allowed to build and to operate nationwide cellular networks. To promote fair competition in the paging service, the paging sector of China Telecom was split in 1998 to form Guoxin Paging Ltd.|$|E
25|$|Unit1 had its license {{temporarily}} suspended {{following the}} incident at Unit2. Although {{the citizens of}} the three counties surrounding the site voted by an overwhelming margin to retire Unit1 permanently in a non-binding resolution in 1982, it was permitted to resume operations in 1985 following a 4-1 vote by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. General Public Utilities Corporation, the plant's owner, formed General Public Utilities Nuclear Corporation (GPUN) as a new subsidiary to own and operate the company's nuclear facilities, including Three Mile Island. The plant had previously been operated by Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed), one of GPU's regional utility operating companies. In 1996, General Public Utilities shortened its name to GPU Inc. Three Mile Island Unit1 was sold to AmerGen Energy Corporation, a joint venture between Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO), and British Energy, in 1998. In 2000, PECO merged with <b>Unicom</b> Corporation to form Exelon Corporation, which acquired British Energy's share of AmerGen in 2003. Today, AmerGen LLC is a fully owned subsidiary of Exelon Generation and owns TMI Unit1, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, and Clinton Power Station. These three units, in addition to Exelon's other nuclear units, are operated by Exelon Nuclear Inc., an Exelon subsidiary.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Nowadays mobile {{streaming}} service through {{cell phone}} {{is becoming the}} highlight of new value-added mobile services. Based on the present CDMA 1 x wireless data network and Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW) platform, adopting compression technologies of H. 264 and QCP, a set of streaming media players are designed and implemented, and the principle, structure, key technologies and performance analysis of this system are introduced. This player works well in practice. Key Words streaming media; Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW); Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP); Real-time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) There are two major methods for audio/video files transfer through the network, downloading and streaming. The volume of storage and network bandwidth restricts transferring big audio/video files. Downloading needs minutes or hours while streaming only takes several seconds in starting and buffering. Streaming server will continuously send real-time packets to clients and the users don’t need {{to wait for the}} whole file to be downloaded. They can play and receive simultaneously without big cache. Streaming is certainly a better choice for the limited working space of cell phone and PDA, etc [1 - 2]. The expanded bandwidth for air interfaces has made a solid ground for streaming media application on wireless networks. With the advantages of wireless system in time and place, mobile streaming media service is very attractive. The China <b>Unicom’s</b> CDMA 1 x data network has an average steady rate of 70 - 80 kbps and is capable of running streaming media business. This paper will introduce the implementation of a mobile streaming client player based on BREW platform. 1 Mobile Streaming Media System Fig. 1 shows the structure of the mobile streaming media system, including four basic parts: the server, the client, the transmission channel and the content source. The server adopts concurrent server of cluster; the client is a cell phone supporting BREW application; the transmission channel uses CDMA 1 x wireless network of China Unicom; and the content source are the streaming type documents or real-time audio/vide...|$|R
