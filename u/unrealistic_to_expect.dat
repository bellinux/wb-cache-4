He then served as its Secretary and spent considerable sums of his own money in order to improve the agricultural yields in the Sologne, an area where farmland was of poor quality. The humidity of the region often led to a blight of the rye harvest, causing outbreaks of ergotism among the population. In 1788 Lavoisier presented a report to the Commission detailing ten years of efforts on his experimental farm to introduce new crops and types of livestock. His conclusion was that despite the possibilities of agricultural reforms, the tax system left tenant farmers with so little that it was <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> them to change their traditional practices.|$|E

Most current approaches for web service discovery cater to semantic web services, i. e., web services that have associated semantic descriptions. It is <b>unrealistic,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> all new services to have associated semantic descriptions. Furthermore, the descriptions {{of the vast majority}} of already existing services do not have explicitly associated semantics. In this paper we present a novel approach for web service discovery that combines semantic and statistical association metrics. Semantic metrics are based on the semantic aspects of relevant ontology. Statistical association metrics are based on the association aspects of web services instances (their inputs and outputs). Specifically, our approach exploits semantic relationship ranking for establishing semantic relevance, and a hyperclique pattern discovery method for grouping web service parameters into meaningful associations. These associations combined by the semantic relevance are then leveraged to discover and rank web services...|$|R

To do so, we must help Israel identify and strengthen those partners who are truly committed to peace, while isolating those who seek conflict and instability, and stand with Israel against those who seek its destruction. The United States and its Quartet partners should continue to isolate Hamas until it renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel's right to exist, and abides by past agreements. Sustained American leadership for peace and security will require patient efforts and the personal commitment of the President of the United States. The creation of a Palestinian state through final status negotiations, together with an international compensation mechanism, should resolve the issue of Palestinian refugees by allowing them to settle there, rather than in Israel.

Real world NLP systems need large scale lexica, which provide rich information about words and word senses at all levels: morphologic, syntactic, lexical semantics etc., but the construction of lexical resources is a difficult and costly task. The last decade has been highly influenced by the notion of reusability, i. e. {{the use of the}} information of existing lexical resources in constructing new ones. It is <b>unrealistic,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> that the great variety of available lexical information resources could be converted into a single and standard representation schema in the near future.

In particular, she argues against [...] "the largest single factor in the U.S. News rating formula" [...] which is the reputational survey as, [...] "it is <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> academic officials to know enough about hundreds of institutions to fairly evaluate the quality of their programs."

[...] Hill states that the members of the Annapolis Group will offer the same information in an alternative, free, format which will not rank schools, as, [...] "an educational experience can't be reduced to one number, a school's so-called rank. The simplicity of a rank is understandably more appealing than spending hours poring over college catalogues and visiting campuses, but myriad complex variables can't be reduced to a single number." [...] Instead, Hill asks students and parents to [...] "compare schools on a variety of factors [...] they should visit campuses and go on what feels like a good match rather than relying on filtered or secondhand information. We must encourage students to look inside their hearts and trust their instincts when it comes to choosing a college, not whether parents or friends think a university is cool or prestigious." ...|$|E

Goltz, who wrote with open admiration about Léon Gambetta's efforts to raise new armies after September 1870 argued that the French [...] "people's war" [...] might have been successful had Gambetta been able to better train his new armies. Goltz argued that henceforward a new age in war had begun, that of the [...] "nation in arms," [...] where the state would seek to mobilize the entire nation and its resources for war, what today might be called total war. The views expressed in the latter work were unpopular with the powers that be and led to Goltz's being sent back to regimental duty for a time, but it was not long before he returned to the military history section. In 1878 Goltz was appointed lecturer in military history at the military academy at Berlin, where he remained for five years and attained the rank of major. He published, in 1883, Roßbach und Jena (new and revised edition, Von Rossbach bis Jena und Auerstadt, 1906) and Das Volk in Waffen (The Nation in Arms), both of which quickly became military classics. The latter also became the theoretical handbook of the Argentine Army, and in 1910 Goltz headed the German diplomatic mission to the Argentine Centennial. During his residence in Berlin, Goltz contributed many articles to the military journals.|$|E

However, the assessment of portfolios reserving differs from the standard one proposed by the BCAC. Insurance companies are increasingly forced toseek the construction of experience tables to manage these risks, especially since it is <b>unrealistic</b> today <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> offset losses by financial products. Traditional adjustment methods, in actuarial literature, usually used to smooth the recovery curve rate estimated usually by the robust Adjusted Kaplan‐Meier estimator, induce a model error due a boundary bias. The available data are usually sparse and poor quality on the border. Thus a boundary bias is due to weight allocation by the fixed symmetric argument outside the support of the gross curve, when smoothing close to the boundary is carried out. The objective of this work is the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for adjustment and smoothing experience tables of maintenance in disability applied to a two cycles real set data. The artificial neural networks are parametric nonlinear models able to play an "universal approximator" role achieving a local and global approximation. Two architectures networks are particularly suited to model and smooth gross output rates: Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) and Radial Basis Functions (RBF) Networks. The robustness of the ANN globally and especially at the edge of curve can be also studied. Graphical tests are used to compare output surfaces rates obtained by neural networks with those obtained by Whittaker‐Henderson framework...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{potential}} for socioeconomically sustainable peatland use by investigating conflicting interests, revealing trade-offs that {{people are willing to}} accept, and studying whether opinions are dependent on socioeconomic and demographic factors. Opinions toward five forms of peatland use and seven peatland ecosystem services were surveyed in Northern Ostrobothnia in northern Finland in 2011. Choice experiment (CE) was used to reveal trade-offs in land use preferences, and groups of respondents were identified using the latent class model (LCM). We identified three classes of respondents in which environmentalists showed a high preference toward the cessation of peat production and increase of peatland restoration, the production-oriented class preferred an increase in timber and peat production areas, and the current use supporters agreed on the present land use policy. However, all respondent classes agreed on the increase of nature protection and the present level of timber production and disagreed on the cessation of restoration. The CE revealed that environmentally minded people who are likely to consider the indirect use values and existence values important are less willing to make trade-offs between ecosystem services than those who emphasize direct use values. Because peatland restoration occurs in commercially unproductive peatlands, it improves both the direct use and existence values without reducing provisioning services of peatlands. Therefore, restoration is commonly accepted by the public, in contrast to management options that involve clear trade-offs between ecosystem services. We conclude that the understanding of preferences and trade-offs can enhance sustainable land use planning. It may be <b>unrealistic,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> a solution that all interest groups would completely accept...|$|R

Economists and laymen routinely view the future of global oil production as being directly related to a simple global Reserves/Production (R/P) ratio. This implies that oil produced {{in all of the}} world’s fields will abruptly stop when the R/P date (40 years in the future) is reached. This is as <b>unrealistic</b> as <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> all humans <b>to</b> die off suddenly, instead of gradually. Global R/Ps should NOT be used to estimate timing of future oil supplies.

We argue that although intuitions are often a reliable guide to belief and action, there are circumstances {{in which they are}} not reliable. Intuitions – including intuitions about enhancement – are subject to various cognitive biases rendering them unreliable in some circumstances.
