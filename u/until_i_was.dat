He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
25|$|World War I badly {{affected}} his financial situation, {{and he had}} a family to take care of, for in 1899 he had married Marguerite Carton de Wiart (1872–1939), and the children had come thick and fast, eight in all. He felt compelled to find a position, and in 1924 he was appointed director of the Municipal Conservatory of Bruges, a function that came with a teaching load. He assumed it with some reluctance, but he discovered that he enjoyed teaching, even “regret that I didn’t enter the teaching profession <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 54.” He kept on composing, albeit at a slower rate. Also, he ceased composing oratorios, which he considered his major works, but that was at least as much due to the death of Charles Martens (1866–1921), his librettist as well as his Maecenas, the tireless propagandist of his music and above all his friend, whose name he never mentioned without preceding it with “my good friend” or similar expression.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{was offered}} the part of Dot Cotton {{for a period of}} three months {{initially}} and in her own words, she was brought in [...] "merely to be Nick Cotton's mother because Nick was coming back again". Brown has told Decca Aitkenhead of The Guardian in 2009 that she was wary of joining a soap opera as she had seen EastEnders once on television, [...] "and there was an argument going on, and I thought, 'Oh, I don't want to watch all that,' so I switched it off. I didn't watch it again <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> asked to be in it." [...] The role was extended and the character {{has become one of the}} longest-running to have featured in EastEnders.|$|E

500|$|Hanna's {{associates}} {{alleged that}} Bushnell had delayed {{the appointment of}} Hanna so that Foraker could be Ohio's senior senator. [...] Herbert Croly, in his biography of Hanna, agreed, and McKinley biographer H.Wayne Morgan also states that Bushnell delayed Hanna's commission for this reason. Hanna biographer William Horner considers this motive possible. [...] In his memoirs, Foraker denied this, stating that Sherman had not resigned from the Senate until the afternoon of March4, 1897 (the date on which the president and Congress were sworn in) so that Sherman could formally introduce Foraker to the Senate. [...] Sherman, according to Foraker, was also unwilling to resign until he had been confirmed as Secretary of State, which {{took place on the}} afternoon of March4. [...] Foraker noted that he had been senator-elect since his selection by the legislature in January 1896 [...] "and there was no vacancy for which Mr. Hanna could be qualified, except only that to be created by the retirement of Mr. Sherman, and Mr. Sherman refused to retire <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sworn and in my seat".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for MTV News at Dylan's Candy Bar, Minaj revealed that she had kept the collaboration a secret from everyone she knew because she was [...] "so surprised" [...] at being asked to work with Carey and {{did not believe that}} the collaboration would actually come to fruition. [...] "That one, I didn’t believe <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> physically in the studio that I was doing with something with Mariah," [...] Minaj said. [...] "She’s an icon, I’ve loved her since I was little, like ’Vision of Love,’ ’Someday.’ I was one of those little girls in the mirror singing her songs with my mother.” A release date of February 23, 2010, for the album was slated, and then pushed back to March 9. It was then further pushed back to March 30. However, it was confirmed in March 2010 that production of Angels Advocate had halted and the project was shelved indefinitely. Island Def Jam stated that the singer was instead working on a new project and [...] "new surprises". Metro revealed that Carey was possibly recording a Christmas album.|$|E
500|$|McKellen {{was born}} on 25 May 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire, the son of Margery Lois (née Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen, a civil engineer. He was their second child, with a sister, Jean, five years his senior. Shortly before the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, his family moved to Wigan. They lived there until Ian was twelve years old, before relocating to Bolton in 1951, after his father had been promoted. The experience of living through the war as a young child had a lasting impact on him, and he later said that [...] "only after peace resumed ... did I realise that war wasn't normal." [...] When an interviewer remarked that he seemed quite calm in the aftermath of 11 September attacks, McKellen said: [...] "Well, darling, you forget—I slept under a steel plate <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> four years old." [...] Even though he only lived in Bolton for less than seven years, as opposed to the eleven years [...] in Wigan beforehand, he refers to Bolton as his [...] "Hometown".|$|E

500|$|Ponsford {{broke into}} {{international}} cricket in the 1924–25 season. After scoring 166 for Victoria against South Australia, and 81 for an Australian XI against the touring English team, {{he was selected}} for the first Test against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Batting at number three, Ponsford joined his captain Herbie Collins at the wicket after the dismissal of opening batsman Warren Bardsley. Although Ponsford initially struggled against the [...] "baffling" [...] swing bowling of Maurice Tate, the experienced Collins was confident enough to farm the strike during Tate's initial spell [...] and Ponsford went on to make a century (110) on his Test debut. Ponsford later said [...] "I was most grateful for Herbie taking [...] <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> settled in. I doubt I would have scored a century but for his selfless approach." [...] He scored 128 in the second Test at Melbourne; thereby becoming the first batsman to score centuries {{in his first two}} Tests. Ponsford played in all five Tests of the series, scoring 468runs at an average of 46.80.|$|E
500|$|After this, Bond's next {{role was}} Phœbe Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888–89). [...] Of this role, Bond wrote, [...] "My {{share in the}} most {{beautiful}} of all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas was delightfully easy and natural. [...] When Gilbert {{gave it to me}} at the first reading he said, 'Here you are, Jessie, you needn't act this, it's you.'" [...] Gilbert was even more nervous than usual on the first night of Yeomen and came backstage to give his best wishes to the cast. [...] Bond wrote, [...] "I am afraid he made himself a perfect nuisance behind the scenes, and did his best, poor fellow, to upset us all. These first nights were very hard on me... and nearly always my understudy was called upon to officiate on the second night of a play, while I lay exhausted in my bed. [...] , the curtain rises on Phœbe alone at her spinning wheel, and Gilbert kept fussing about... <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> almost as demented as he was. [...] At last I turned on him savagely. [...] 'For Heaven's sake, Mr. Gilbert, go away and leave me alone, or I shan't be able to sing a note!' He gave me a final frenzied hug, and vanished." ...|$|E
500|$|The next {{international}} {{visitors to}} Australia were the English team of 1924–1925, under the captaincy of Arthur Gilligan. In the First Test at Sydney, Collins opened the batting and scored 114. Batting {{with a young}} Victorian in his début Test, Bill Ponsford, Collins was confident enough to shelter him from the brilliant swing bowling of Maurice Tate. Ponsford went on to make a century (110) on début. Ponsford later said [...] "I was most grateful for Herbie taking [...] <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> settled in. I doubt I would have scored a century but for his selfless approach." [...] In the Second Test at Melbourne, chasing 600, the English pair of Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day for an unbroken partnership of 283. Before play commenced the next day, Collins said to his profligate leg spinner, [...] "You're going straight on to get Hobbs if we're to have a chance". The first ball of the day, Mailey bowled a full toss. Collins moved the field, leaving {{a gap in the}} offside field. The next ball was another full toss and Hobbs, looking to hit it into the gap, missed it all ends up and was bowled for 154.|$|E

500|$|When Tisdale was twelve, {{she sang}} for then-President Bill Clinton during an {{event at the}} White House {{as part of a}} troupe. Hoping to expand her career, Tisdale and her family moved to Los Angeles, California. She landed her first role in 1997, guest {{starring}} on an episode of both Smart Guy and 7th Heaven. During this time, she also began doing modeling work for Ford Models. The following year, Tisdale appeared as a voice actor in both An All Dogs Christmas Carol (1998) and A Bug's Life (1998). She guest starred in an episode of Boston Public in 2000, earning a 2000 Young Artist Award nomination for [...] "Best Guest Performance in a TV Drama". Tisdale continued to make guest appearances on television shows and appear in minor film roles throughout the following years, with roles in films such as Donnie Darko (2001) and The Mayor of Oyster Bay (2002). During this time, Tisdale continued to work and attend school, stating [...] "I was always in regular school and I worked in clothing stores growing up. I didn't 'make it' <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 18, so I had already graduated public school. I definitely feel like I had the best of both worlds." ...|$|E
500|$|Mills left Forest {{shortly before}} the end of 1981–82 to join the Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League in March 1982. He made 31 appearances, scored five goals and {{recorded}} seven assists in the 1982 North American Soccer League season as Seattle finished first in the Western Division. He started for Seattle in Soccer Bowl '82 before being substituted for Roger Davies, and the match was won 1–0 by the New York Cosmos with a 31st-minute goal scored by Giorgio Chinaglia. Less than a month later he made a temporary return to England by signing for Forest's local rivals Derby County on loan on 13 October 1982. Mills made his debut three days later in a 1–1 away draw with Grimsby Town in the Second Division, before scoring his first goal with Derby's second in a 2–0 home win over Queens Park Rangers on 3 January 1983. His loan ended in April 1983, having made 23 appearances and scored two goals for Derby in 1982–83. Early in the 1983 North American Soccer League season he had his leg broken by David Watson and was kept out of action for a year. However, this acted as a wake-up call for Mills, who said: [...] "It made me work really hard and that's what made me go on and play <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 47. I never stopped working on my fitness".|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E

2500|$|Taylor {{asserted}} in {{his autobiography}} that prominent bicycle racers of his era often cooperated to defeat him, such as the Butler brothers (Nat and Tom) were accused of doing in the one-mile world championship race at Montreal in 1899. At the LAW races in Boston, shortly after Taylor had won the world championship, he accused the entire field that included Tom Cooper and Eddie Bald, among others for fouling him. Taylor complained after the event {{that he had been}} [...] "bumped, jostled, and elbowed <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sorely tried." [...] Racing promoter William A. Brady, who was also Taylor's manager, chastised the other riders for their [...] "rough treatment" [...] of Taylor during the race.|$|E
