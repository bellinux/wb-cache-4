40|$|The {{effects of}} climate change have now reached all parts of the world, and for many people, climate-related {{stressors}} add an additional layer onto the complex environmental, social, and economic factors already contributing to their vulnerability. Rural communities that rely to a great extent on local ecosystems for their livelihoods may be greatly affected by seemingly minor alterations in climatic conditions, which then catalyze other environmental changes. In the northern Bolivian Amazon, climate change, land cover change, and fire use in land management are interacting synergistically across multiple scales to generate an elevated risk of <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>fires.</b> This study explores how <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>fires</b> have affected the livelihoods of one group of actors in this region, campesinos, and the implications for ecosystem-based development interventions. It also touches on how campesino communities, civil society organizations, and the Bolivian forest and land management agency, ABT, have responded to the elevated risk of <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>fires.</b> I carried out a total of 43 semi-structured interviews with residents of five campesino communities in the department of Pando, Bolivia, from May to August, 2013. Focus group discussions, participatory mapping, and household surveys in the focal communities, as well as interviews with local civil society organization staff, served as supplementary sources of information. Residents of four of the five focal communities reported that they had experienced <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>fires</b> at least once between 2003 and 2013. In three of the communities, some residents had experienced significant damage to annual crops, agroforestry systems, wild cacao, or Brazil nut trees. The effects of <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>fires</b> have implications for ecosystem-based development interventions that are being carried out in rural communities throughout the northern Bolivian Amazon. Local civil society organizations, supported by international donors, are promoting the development of agroforestry systems, commercialization of cultivated and wild cacao, and increase of Brazil nut harvesting income, among other interventions. Because these productive systems are susceptible to <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>fires,</b> the increasing incidence of fires in the region has the potential to derail these interventions over the short or medium term. There are already indications that without additional fire adaptation measures, agroforestry systems are no longer appropriate in some communities. Separate interventions by civil society and the ABT to reduce and control the use of fire as a land management tool have mainly focused on campesino communities. Given that <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>fires</b> are caused by multi-scaled factors ranging from global climate to regional land use patterns to local fire use practices, I suggest that campesino communities have limited agency and {{may not be the most}} appropriate actors to target for such interventions. Other local actors, particularly owners of large cattle ranches, appear to contribute much more to <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>fires,</b> including fires that spread to community land, and may therefore represent a higher priority target for fire mitigation interventions...|$|R

40|$|Controlled {{fires are}} {{beneficial}} for {{the generation of}} heat and power while <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>fires,</b> like fire incidents and wildfires, are detrimental and can cause enormous material damage and human suffering. Transport phenomena such as buoyant flow, momentum, convective heat and mass transfer as well as chemical reactions between combustible species and oxygen from the surrounding air play important turbulent mixing {{are important to the}} mechanism of flame heat transfer that govern fire release rates. The mechanisms of ignition, flame spread, steady burning flame extinction and smoke transport all need to be considered in fire modelling. In addition, temperature-dependent properties are important factors for consideration. For <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>fires,</b> the evolution in time is of great concern. This edited book presents {{the state of the art}} of modelling and numerical simulation of the important transport phenomena in fires. It describes how computational procedures can be used in analysis and design of fire protection and fire safety. Computational fluid dynamics, turbulence modelling, combustion, soot formation, thermal radiation modelling are demonstrated and applied to pool fires, flame spread, wildfires, fires in buildings and other examples. All of the chapters follow a unified outline and presentation to aid accessibility and the book provides invaluable information for both graduate researchers and R&D engineers in industry and consultancy...|$|R
