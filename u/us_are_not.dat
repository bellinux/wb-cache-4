25|$|When the {{underlying}} cause of sleep problems is not immediately obvious, behavioral treatments are usually the first suggested. These range from patient education about sleep hygiene to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Studies of both younger and older adults have compared CBT to medication and found that CBT {{should be considered a}} first-line and cost-effective intervention for chronic insomnia, not least because gains may be maintained at long-term follow-up. Sleep physicians and psychologists, at least in the <b>US,</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> in agreement about who should perform CBT nor whether sleep centers should be required to have psychologists on staff. In the UK the number of CBT-trained therapists is limited so CBT is not widely available on the NHS.|$|E
25|$|A {{review study}} {{suggested}} that the children with lesbian or gay parents appear less traditionally gender-typed {{and are more likely}} to be open to homoerotic relationships, partly due to genetic (80% of the children being raised by same-sex couples in the <b>US</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> adopted and most are the result of heterosexual marriages)) and family socialization processes (children grow up in relatively more tolerant school, neighborhood, and social contexts, which are less heterosexist), even though majority of children raised by same-sex couples identify as heterosexual. A 2005 review by Charlotte J. Patterson for the American Psychological Association found that the available data did not suggest higher rates of homosexuality among the children of lesbian or gay parents. One study suggested that children of gay and lesbian parents were more likely to adopt non-heterosexual identities, especially daughters of lesbian parents (inter-generational transfer was not significant in some analyses for sons).|$|E

2500|$|Winnings (in the <b>U.S.)</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{necessarily}} {{paid out}} in a lump sum, contrary to the expectation of many lottery participants. In certain countries, mainly the U.S., the winner gets to choose between an annuity payment and a one-time payment. The one-time payment (cash or lump sum) is a [...] "smaller" [...] amount than the advertised (annuity) jackpot, even before applying any withholdings to which the prize is subject. While withholdings vary by jurisdiction and how winnings are invested, {{it is suggested that}} a winner who chooses lump sum expects to pocket 1/3 of the advertised jackpot {{at the end of the}} tax year. Therefore, a winner of a $100,000,000 jackpot who chooses cash can expect $33,333,333.33 net after filing income tax document(s) for the year in which the jackpot was won.|$|E
2500|$|In Echlin's {{article in}} The Guardian, six reasons for {{choosing}} polyamory are identified: a drive towards female independence and equality driven by feminism; disillusionment with monogamy; a yearning for community; honesty and realism {{in respect of}} relational nature of human beings; human nature; and individual non-matching of the traditional monogamous stereotype. Jim Fleckenstein, director of the Institute for 21st-Century Relationships, is quoted as stating that the polyamory movement has been driven not only by science fiction, but also by feminism: [...] "Increased financial independence means that women can build relationships {{the way they want}} to." [...] The disillusionment with monogamy is said to be [...] "because of widespread cheating and divorce". The longing for community is associated with a felt need for the richness of [...] "complex and deep relationships through extended networks" [...] in response to the replacement and fragmentation of the extended family by nuclear families. [...] "For many", Echlin writes, [...] "it is a hankering for community... we have become increasingly alienated, partly because of the 20th century's replacement of the extended family with the nuclear family. As a result, many of us are striving to create complex and deep relationships through extended networks of multiple lovers and extended families... Polys agree that some people are monogamous by nature. But some of <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> and more and more are refusing to be shoehorned into monogamy." ...|$|E
