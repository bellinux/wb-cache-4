5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941, when the Armored Force expanded, an urgent need for {{self-propelled}} artillery arose.

Although this design had originally been suggested in September 1941, {{it had not been}} taken up. However, the <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> the requirement resulted in the approval by the Adjutant General and the construction of a prototype was authorized by OCM 17391, dated 31 October 1941; the new vehicle designated as the 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage T19.|$|E
5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. The <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We studied seven {{hydropower}} license consultations {{to examine}} {{the role of a}} sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to reach agreement. Hydropower licensing consultations were studied because the statutory requirement for consultation encourages negotiation, all such consultations are similar, and a negotiated settlement is not a foregone result. Cases selected for analysis met screening criteria. Structured interviews were conducted with participants after the negotiations had been concluded. Respondent recollections were checked against the documentary record. A sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to reach agreement was a significant factor in the completion of these negotiations; where there was no shared sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency,</b> purposeful delay adversely affected the negotiations. Although a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> was experienced by at least one party in each case, only a shared sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> {{at the end of the}} process proved significant. Delay did not prevent ultimate agreement but a shared sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> brought speedier agreement and greater satisfaction with the negotiation...|$|R

The legislators convened on November 28, and Garrard, drawing on {{his experience as a}} surveyor, addressed them regarding the <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> adopting a new law and forestalling more lawsuits related to land claims, which were already numerous. Although a wealthy landowner himself, Garrard advocated protecting Kentucky's large debtor class from foreclosure on their lands. Garrard supported pro-squatting legislation, including measures that forbade the collection of taxes from squatters on profits they made from working the land they occupied and that required landowners to pay squatters for any improvements they made on their land. Despite opposition from some aristocratic legislators like John Breckinridge, most of the reforms advocated by Garrard were approved in the session.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{biennial}} {{reports from the}} U.S. National Research Council have reviewed the progress of CERP. The fourth report in the series, released in 2012, found that little {{progress has been made}} in restoring the core of the remaining Everglades ecosystem; instead, most project construction so far has occurred along its periphery. The report noted that to reverse ongoing ecosystem declines, it will be necessary to expedite restoration projects that target the central Everglades, and to improve both the quality and quantity of the water in the ecosystem. To better understand the potential implications of the current slow pace of progress, the report assessed the current status of ten Everglades ecosystem attributes, including phosphorus loads, peat depth, and populations of snail kites, birds of prey that are endangered in South Florida. Most attributes received grades ranging from C (degraded) to D (significantly degraded), but the snail kite received a grade of F (near irreversible damage). The report also assessed the future trajectory of each ecosystem attribute under three restoration scenarios: improved water quality, improved hydrology, and improvements to both water quality and hydrology, which helped highlight the <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> restoration actions to benefit a wide range of ecosystem attributes and demonstrate the cost of inaction. Overall, the report concluded that substantial near-term progress to address both water quality and hydrology in the central Everglades is needed to reverse ongoing degradation before it is too late.|$|E
5|$|The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general {{election}} {{and led by}} Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress (led by Mahatma Gandhi) and the Muslim League (led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah)—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to {{how it should be}} implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than June 30, 1948. When the <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.|$|E

This exploratory study examined the relationship between superintendents' perceived sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> and student academic performance. More specifically, the study examined the leadership of Missouri superintendents based upon a district's Annual Performance Report. The Missouri Annual Performance Report ranks districts from highest to lowest with the following designations: performance with distinction; full waiver; limited waiver; provisionally accredited; and, unaccredited. This study focused only on the sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> in the districts performing with distinction, performing with a full waiver, and performing with a limited waiver due to limited sample size in the lower levels of provisionally accredited and unaccredited. A total of 98 superintendents in Missouri were included in this study. Quantitative data were collected using survey responses. Superintendents responded to items about their perceptions of their own sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance, the source <b>of</b> their <b>urgency,</b> their purposeful communication <b>of</b> <b>urgency,</b> their perceptions <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> in district stakeholders, and the strategies used to communicate the urgency. Data from the surveys were analyzed using analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, and step-wise linear regression. Superintendents in districts performing with a limited waiver reported a significantly stronger sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance than did superintendents in districts performing with distinction {{at the end of the}} first year in their position as superintendent. Superintendents in districts with a limited waiver also reported a significantly stronger sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance than did superintendents in districts performing with distinction at the time of the survey. Superintendents in districts with a limited waiver purposefully communicated significantly more often than superintendents in districts performing with distinction with boards of education. In addition, superintendents in districts with a limited waiver purposefully communicated significantly more frequently with all district teachers than superintendents in districts performing with distinction. Superintendents leading districts performing with a limited waiver and superintendents leading districts with a full waiver identified an impending crisis to communicate a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance significantly more often than superintendents leading districts performing with distinction. Through regression analysis, Providing Opportunities for Success, Identifying an Impending Crisis, Setting Goals and Targets, and Utilizing Data were communication strategies significantly associated with the degree to which the sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance increased throughout the district. Regression findings also implied that utilizing the communication strategy "providing opportunities for success" could increase the sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> for boards <b>of</b> education, district administrators, building principals, teacher leaders, all district teachers and the media. Throughout this study it was evident that superintendents leading districts with a limited waiver, which indicates lower student academic performance, reported a stronger sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student achievement than did their counterparts in higher performing districts. These superintendents purposefully communicated a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> more often and they used the communication strategy of "identifying an impending crisis" more frequently to increase a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> across their districts than did superintendents in districts with higher student performance. In addition, when superintendents utilize the communication strategy of "providing opportunities for success," which includes actions such as articulating a vision and implementing a purposeful school improvement process, an increase in a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student achievement is more likely to occur...|$|R
