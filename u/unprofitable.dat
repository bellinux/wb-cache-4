5|$|Both Braathens SAFE and SAS {{had been}} cross-subsidizing their routes. Through the regulations, the {{airlines}} {{had agreed to}} fly to <b>unprofitable</b> airports, in exchange for making higher profits on other routes. With free competition, {{this would not be}} followed, and the authorities announced the introduction of public service obligations on routes that were not profitable. To finance these, a NOK10 fee would be charged on all primary routes. The cost of collecting this fee was so high that SAS and Braathens SAFE announced it was cheaper to continue to fly to the <b>unprofitable</b> airports. Braathens SAFE stated that their routes Haugesund–Bergen and Oslo–Røros–Trondheim were not profitable.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} a small producer, VAT had {{problems}} with unreliable deliveries and quality problems caused by the component suppliers. Semi-finished lorries often waited outside the factory for engines or other key components. The British diesel engines suffered from more quality problems compared with their Swedish and German competitors. The company's owners became increasingly reluctant to fund the <b>unprofitable</b> business.|$|E
5|$|Besides running {{scheduled}} services and government-contracted flights to most {{villages in the}} country, the airline also supports remote research stations, provides charter services for tourists and Greenland's energy and mineral-resource industries and permits medivac during emergencies. Air Greenland has seven subsidiaries, an airline, hotels, tour operators, a travel agency specialized in Greenlandic tourism and the Arctic Umiaq Line, an <b>unprofitable</b> but government-subsidised ferry service.|$|E
5|$|Competition from {{road traffic}} {{starting}} {{in the early twentieth}} century put pressure on the railway, and it was later a victim of the Beeching cuts. The line was seen as <b>unprofitable,</b> and it closed to passengers in 1964, and to goods traffic in 1967. Part of the trackbed today provides a section of the Milton Keynes redway system.|$|E
5|$|The ferry {{has been}} <b>unprofitable</b> since its {{founding}} in 2006, but Greenland Home Rule provided the owners with a loss guarantee through 2011, allowing the subsidiary to break even. The deficit was DKK 8.1 million for 2011 and, on 16 March 2010, Air Greenland announced plans to divest its stock. Greenland Home Rule avoided this by undertaking to continue the guarantee at least through 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} benefit of {{adopting}} {{a single currency}} is to remove the cost of exchanging currency, theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously <b>unprofitable</b> trades. For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g., credit cards, debit cards and cash machine withdrawals).|$|E
5|$|Traffic on {{the river}} in 1823 was 39,516tons, which {{generated}} tolls of £2,194. After {{the construction of the}} canal, traffic steadily declined, until income was insufficient to cover maintenance by the early 1860s. The canal company used a similar accounting practice to manage the Tone debt, inflating it at six per cent each year, to ensure that they could demonstrate that the river was <b>unprofitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of aposematism posits that it arises by reciprocal selection between predators and prey, where distinctive features in prey, which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators or it may give rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness of prey, and it is not contingent upon predator sampling of prey to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other <b>unprofitable</b> features.|$|E
5|$|After {{two more}} episodes, Buzz F/X {{terminated}} its <b>unprofitable</b> contract with H-B, later {{filing for bankruptcy}} in 1997 due to $3.6million of debt created by work on Quest. H-B hired Blur Studio to finish the second season's scenes on a ten-week production schedule. Blur used Intergraph hardware, and its sharp performance attracted press attention and sealed an amicable relationship with H-B. Both companies produced in total roughly one hundred minutes of computer animation for QuestWorld.|$|E
5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO would be able to switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of <b>unprofitable</b> ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} {{the building of}} a line through Lier started in 1895, and construction commenced in 1901. The line opened on 12 July 1904 and was initially profitable, in part because of tourist traffic. In 1920, the Drammen Line was converted to standard gauge, resulting in expensive transshipment between the two lines. This and falling traffic caused the line to become <b>unprofitable.</b> The Lier line was closed for ordinary traffic on 23 October 1932. All traffic ceased on 1 January 1937 and the track was demolished shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{the company}} {{established}} a duty-free shop at Torp. By 1987, Norsk Air was losing NOK20 million per year. The company established a route from Sandefjord to Göteborg Landvetter Airport and to London Stansted Airport, but neither were profitable, and were quickly terminated. Norsk Air started a route from Fagernes Airport, Leirin to Oslo and Bergen on 4 November 1987. The route {{turned out to}} be <b>unprofitable,</b> and was terminated on 1 June 1988, after the company had lost NOK 5 million on the route.|$|E
5|$|In August 1931, Amazing was {{acquired}} by Teck Publications, a subsidiary of Bernarr Macfadden's Macfadden Publications. Macfadden's deep pockets helped insulate Amazing from the financial strain caused by the Great Depression. The schedule of Amazing Stories Quarterly began to slip, but Amazing did not miss {{an issue in the}} early 1930s. However, it became <b>unprofitable</b> to publish over the next few years. Circulation dropped to little more than 25,000 in 1934, and in October 1935 it switched to a bimonthly schedule.|$|E
5|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} in The Videophile newsletter, Muntz revealed {{the biggest problem}} for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. He explained that when reproducing the work of major artists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make {{hundreds of thousands of}} cartridges. But once a popular album became less popular, retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was unprepared for the returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business <b>unprofitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late 1978, Guccione {{shut down}} the <b>unprofitable</b> magazine. Wintour decided {{to take some time}} off from work. She broke up with Bradshaw and began a {{relationship}} with French record producer Michel Esteban, for two years dividing her time with him between Paris and New York. She returned to work in 1980, succeeding Elsa Klensch as fashion editor for a new women's magazine named Savvy. It sought to appeal to career-conscious professional women, who spent their own money, the readers Wintour would later target at Vogue.|$|E
5|$|PSA {{decided that}} the Linwood plant would be <b>unprofitable</b> to {{maintain}} and should be closed, which meant an end to both the Avenger and Sunbeam model lines, further emphasizing {{the need for a}} new small car in the Talbot lineup. On the eve of the 1980s, PSA's city cars lineup consisted of models based on the veteran front-wheel drive 1972 Peugeot 104, which came in a shorter three-door and longer five-door version. Citroën rebadged the short-wheelbase 104 as the Citroën LN, and the long-wheelbase chassis formed the base of the five-door Citroën Visa.|$|E
5|$|Superfinalen ("The Super Final") is {{a former}} Norwegian {{association}} football competition contested between the previous season's champions of the Norwegian Premier League and the Norwegian Football Cup. The super cup was incorporated {{as part of a}} charity-themed television show broadcast on TV2, with the profits from the matches going to UNICEF. The competition was held twice, in 2009 and 2010. The first competition saw Stabæk, reigning league winners, beat Vålerenga 3–1. The following year, league winners Rosenborg beat cup winners Aalesund 3–1. The competition was then deemed commercially <b>unprofitable</b> and abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The NTA Film Network was {{an early}} American {{television}} network founded by Ely Landau in 1956. The network was not a full-time television network like CBS, NBC, or ABC. Rather, it operated on a part-time basis, broadcasting films and several first-run television programs from major Hollywood studios. Despite attracting over 100 affiliate stations and the financial support of Twentieth Century-Fox (which purchased a 50% share of NTA in November 1956) the network proved <b>unprofitable,</b> and was discontinued by 1961. The NTA Film Network's flagship station, WNTA-TV, is now WNET, one of the flagship stations of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{government}} secretly {{returned the}} <b>unprofitable</b> Louisiana territory to France in October 1800 in the Treaty of San Ildefonso. The Spanish officially transferred control in October 1802; however, Spanish administrators remained {{in charge of}} St. Louis throughout the time of French ownership. Shortly afterward, a team of American negotiators purchased Louisiana, including St. Louis. On March 8 or 9, 1804, the flag of Spain was lowered at the government buildings in St. Louis and, according to local tradition, the flag of France was raised. On March 10, 1804, the French flag was replaced by that of the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} and {{opening of the}} Erie Canal in 1825 along the same alignment as the Albany to Buffalo route began to eat away at the revenues of these turnpike companies. In time, the turnpike business had become <b>unprofitable</b> and the companies were dissolved by 1852, causing the roads to revert to public control. The Seneca Road Company dissolved in 1852. The old, southern path of the Seneca Turnpike is now Franklin Street and Old Seneca Turnpike from Auburn to Marcellus, NY175 between Marcellus and Onondaga Hill, and NY173 from there east to Chittenango.|$|E
5|$|The defunct Loma Verde Mine, {{which is}} still visible in the RMD, {{produced}} {{a small amount of}} copper and gold between 1897 and 1907. Mining of igneous rock at 149 sites in the TMD sometimes produced ores of modest value in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The most successful, the Copper King Mine (later renamed the Mile Wide Mine), yielded 34,000 tons of copper, gold, lead, zinc, and molybdenum ores, mostly during the war years of 1917, 1918, and 1941; it closed permanently in 1942 when it became <b>unprofitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{purchase}} of the Boeing 707 aircraft would be followed by several orders for Vickers competing design, the VC10, with BOAC having ordered 35 VC10 aircraft by 1959 and an additional ten (bringing the total on order to 45) by 1961. Payments for these aircraft together with a downturn in transatlantic traffic, increased competition on the transatlantic route by additional carriers equipped with jet aircraft, and {{a whole host of}} additional costs associated with the Vickers VC10 and Bristol Britannia purchase would result in BOAC becoming extremely <b>unprofitable</b> from late 1961 onwards.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1800s, Credit Suisse set up banking and {{insurance}} companies in Germany, Brussels, Geneva and others (as SKA International) with the bank as a shareholder of each company. It created insurance companies like Swiss RE, Swiss Life, Rentenanstalt and Schweiz. Credit Suisse had its first <b>unprofitable</b> year in 1886, due to losses in agriculture, venture investments, commodities and international trade. The bank created its own sugar beet factory, bought 25,000 shares in animal breeding ventures and supported an export business, Schweizerische Exportgesellschaft, that experienced heavy losses for over-speculative investing.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{retirement}} to personal business at Mount Vernon was short-lived. He made an exploratory {{trip to the}} western frontier in 1784 and inspected his land holdings in Western Pennsylvania that had been earned decades earlier for his service in the French and Indian War. There he confronted squatters, including David Reed and the Covenanters; they vacated, but only after losing a court decision heard in Washington, Pennsylvania in 1786. He also facilitated {{the creation of the}} Potomac Company, a public–private partnership that sought to link the Potomac River with the Ohio River, but technical and financial challenges rendered the company <b>unprofitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the {{cooperation}} of the United States Department of Agriculture, efforts are under way to promote G.brachycera as a groundcover for use in landscaping. Box huckleberry is commercially available from at least one source {{but it is difficult to}} propagate, making it <b>unprofitable</b> for many nurseries to carry. In New Bloomfield, PA, the box huckleberry has become part of the local New Year's celebrations, as a papier-mâché replica of a huckleberry is dropped, instead of a ball, to mark the new year.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the airline renewed its aging fleet, {{retiring}} several of its S-61 and 206 helicopters and replacing them with Bell 212s and Eurocopter AS350s. The company also sacked its CEO Peter Fich, who had proven unable to balance Greenland Home Rule's demands for local Greenlander service with the board's for expanded tourism, lower fares and higher profits. Under his replacement Finn Øelund, Grønlandsfly initially posted a DKK 30 million loss as contractual obligations maintained <b>unprofitable</b> service while a strike ruined the summer tourist season and Post Greenland moved a lucrative mail contract to the Danish-owned Air Alpha Greenland. In response, the company successfully pushed back against Greenland Home Rule's large demands, high fees and low subsidies and rebranded itself, anglicising its name to Air Greenland and adopting a new logo and livery on 18 April 2002.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of friends in the anti-slavery movement, Coffin moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1847 to operate a {{warehouse}} that sold only free-labor goods. Despite making considerable progress with the business, the free-labor venture proved <b>unprofitable</b> and he abandoned the enterprise in 1857. From 1847 through 1857, Coffin continued to assist hundreds of runaway slaves by lodging them in his Ohio home. When slavery was abolished after the American Civil War, Coffin traveled around the Midwest and overseas to France and Great Britain, where he was instrumental in forming aid societies that provided food, clothing, funds, and education to former slaves. Coffin retired from public life in the 1870s and wrote an autobiography, Reminiscences of Levi Coffin, published in 1876, a year before his death.|$|E
5|$|Farming has {{traditionally}} been the basis of Cardiganshire's economy, with dairying and stock-rearing being the main occupations. Before the first railway was built in 1866, the stock used to be herded over the mountains to England, where Rugby, Northampton and London were important destinations. At one {{time there was a}} sizeable mining industry in Cardiganshire, but the reserves of lead, silver and zinc became <b>unprofitable</b> to mine by {{the early part of the}} twentieth century. Shipping was also important in the county, with coal and lime being imported in coastal vessels, and mineral ores and oak bark for tanning being exported. Shipbuilding was an important industry with most of Wales' sailing vessels being built in Cardiganshire.|$|E
5|$|Founding {{publisher}} Alexander {{was born}} about 1830 {{and came to}} Oregon from Illinois as a pioneer in 1852. Alexander initially worked as a farmer, supplementing his income as a surveyor and local {{justice of the peace}} before learning the printing trade working for the town's earlier pro-Southern newspapers. Although his own venture as a publisher was short and <b>unprofitable,</b> Alexander unwittingly was the scion of a local newspaper dynasty in Oregon, with two of his sons later themselves publishing The Guard (following the tenure of several intermediate owners), while a grandson, George L. Alexander, would one day edit another Oregon paper, the Lebanon Express.|$|E
5|$|From January 1995, the {{frequency}} between Steinkjer and Melhus was increased slightly. On 26 September 1995, {{the train station}} in Trondheim reopened as a renovated station that serves both buses, coaches and trains. The investment cost NOK50 million. In 1997, NSB stated that the Trøndelag Commuter Rail was <b>unprofitable</b> and threatened to terminate it, along {{with an array of}} other services, if funding was not increased. The same year, 750,000 people traveled with the commuter rail. The 20% increase that year was in part due to the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1997 being held in Trondheim, and was the service in the country with the largest growth.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the Norwegian National Rail Administration {{warned that}} lack of funding {{might lead to a}} closure of all long-distance {{passenger}} trains in Norway, including the Bergen Line. Torild Skogsholm, Minister of Transport and Communications assured that it was not the government's policy to close railway lines. In 2004 the Progress Party suggested closing down the railway line and replacing it with a motorway between Bergen and Oslo, arguing that the railway was <b>unprofitable,</b> and that bus transport was cheaper while easier truck transport would aid business. Other political parties rejected the proposal pointing out the better environmental performance of the railway and that the railway transports large volumes of freight.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Finn Øelund left to head Maersk Air and was {{replaced}} as CEO by Flemming Knudson. Air Greenland opened a route from Copenhagen to Akureyri in Iceland; the service lasted for six years before finally being deemed <b>unprofitable</b> and ended. Also in 2003, SAS abandoned its Greenland service, leading Air Greenland to purchase its second airliner, an Airbus A330-200 named Norsaq. (SAS briefly revived the service during the peak season in 2007 before dropping it again in January 2009.) Owing to SAS's withdrawal from the market, Air Greenland received its contract with the U.S. Air Force for passenger service to and from Thule Air Base. Running from February 2004, the contract was renewed for another five-year period in 2008 despite SAS's brief return to the market.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, the mule {{breeding}} industry collapsed with the advent of mechanization. By 1922, Poitevin foals became difficult to sell, and the population dropped dramatically as there was no economic incentive for breeding. A continued breeding of mules caused the breed to decline faster than other draft breeds, as purebred horses were not bred as often. By 1945, breed selection was oriented towards the production of meat, as the only remaining economic opportunity for farmers. The conformation of the breed changed slightly to become shorter, but the Poitevin remained <b>unprofitable</b> for horse meat, as breeders preferred to invest in herds of Comtois and Breton horses, which were faster growing and higher yielding.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{shows the}} {{characteristic}} chemical {{properties of the}} transition metals, namely the ability to form variable oxidation states differing by steps of one and a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry: indeed, it was the discovery of an iron compound, ferrocene, that revolutionalized the latter field in the 1950s. Iron is sometimes considered as a prototype for the entire block of transition metals, due to its abundance and the immense role it has played in the technological progress of humanity. Its 26 electrons are arranged in the configuration 3d64s2, of which the 3d and 4s electrons are relatively close in energy, and thus it can lose a variable number of electrons {{and there is no}} clear point where further ionization becomes <b>unprofitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Landis {{was born}} in Millville, Ohio, in 1866. His name was a {{spelling}} variation on the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in the American Civil War, where his father was wounded in 1864. Landis {{spent much of his}} youth in Indiana; he left school at fifteen and worked in a series of positions in that state. His involvement in politics led to a civil service job. At age 21, Landis applied to become a lawyer—there were then no educational or examination requirements for the Indiana bar. Following a year of <b>unprofitable</b> practice, he went to law school. After his graduation, he opened an office in Chicago, but left it when Walter Q. Gresham, the new United States Secretary of State, named him his personal secretary in 1893. After Gresham's death in 1895, Landis refused an offer of an ambassadorship, and returned to Chicago to practice law and marry.|$|E
5|$|Norsk Air was a Norwegian airline {{based at}} Sandefjord Airport, Torp. At its height from the mid-1980s and onwards it {{operated}} scheduled flights to Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim and Copenhagen, and for shorter periods also other Norwegian and international destinations. The airline had 156 employees and 150,000 annual passengers in 1989. The company was {{established as a}} sole proprietorship by Øyvind Skaunfelt as Vestfoldfly in 1961, after purchasing Thor Solberg's aviation school at Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg. In addition to an aviation college, the company operated various charter services using mostly Cessna aircraft. The company split into a flying school and an airline in 1972, with the latter taking the name Norsk Flytjeneste. Three 50-passenger Douglas DC-6 were subsequently bought and were among other places flown with aid charters to Bangladesh. Both the DC-6 and later charter flights with business jets proved <b>unprofitable</b> and were quickly terminated.|$|E
