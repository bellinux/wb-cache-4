5|$|Symantec {{announced}} a Professional Edition on November 19, 2002. Data recovery tools in this version allow users to recover deleted or malware-damaged files. The {{inclusion of a}} data erasure tool allows users to delete files while minimizing the chance of recovery. Web Cleanup removes browser cache files, history, and cookies. To maintain dial-up connections, Connection Keep Alive simulates online activity during periods of user inactivity. Norton Productivity Control enables users to filter Internet content and block newsgroups. When used with the <b>User</b> <b>Access</b> Manager, multiple filtering profiles can be created, assigned to different users.|$|E
25|$|Inherently safe; no {{possibility}} of eye damage. This can be either because of a low output power (in which case eye damage is impossible even after hours of exposure), or due to an enclosure preventing <b>user</b> <b>access</b> to the laser beam during normal operation, such as in CD players or laser printers.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the command}} su, users supply their {{personal}} password to sudo if necessary. After authentication, {{and if the}} configuration file permits the <b>user</b> <b>access,</b> the system invokes the requested command. By default the user's password can be retained through a grace period (15 minutes per pseudo terminal), allowing the user to execute several successive commands as the requested user without having to provide a password again.|$|E

25|$|Apple, Digital Research, IBM and Microsoft used many of Xerox's {{ideas to}} develop products, and IBM's Common <b>User</b> <b>Access</b> {{specifications}} {{formed the basis}} of the user interfaces used in Microsoft Windows, IBM OS/2 Presentation Manager, and the Unix Motif toolkit and window manager. These ideas evolved to create the interface found in current versions of Microsoft Windows, and in various desktop environments for Unix-like operating systems, such as macOS and Linux. Thus most current GUIs have largely common idioms.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the similar}} command su, users must, by default, supply their own {{password}} for authentication, {{rather than the}} password of the target user. After authentication, and if the configuration file, which is typically located at /etc/sudoers, permits the <b>user</b> <b>access,</b> the system invokes the requested command. The configuration file offers detailed access permissions, including enabling commands only from the invoking terminal; requiring a password per user or group; requiring re-entry of a password every time or never requiring a password at all for a particular command line. It can also be configured to permit passing arguments or multiple commands.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by {{his work}} with ancient hieroglyphic writing systems, he envisioned a {{communication}} program in which a group of ideas could be represented by one single picture. The specific idea that the user wished to convey would {{be determined by the}} context or sequence in which the picture was used. As a result, he began developing a computer system using inputs from multi-meaning pictures {{in a variety of ways}} that would allow the <b>user</b> <b>access</b> to a wide array of language. These multi-meaning pictures would maximize the user’s current communication abilities and facilitate information exchange in an economical way.|$|E

500|$|It {{is often}} said that [...] "Only perl can parse Perl", meaning that only the Perl {{interpreter}} (perl) can parse the Perl language (Perl), but even this is not, in general, true. Because the Perl interpreter can simulate a Turing machine during its compile phase, it would need to decide the halting problem in order to complete parsing in every case. It is a long-standing result that the halting problem is undecidable, and therefore not even perl can always parse Perl. Perl makes the unusual choice of giving the <b>user</b> <b>access</b> to its full programming power in its own compile phase. The cost in terms of theoretical purity is high, but practical inconvenience seems to be rare.|$|E
500|$|In {{conjunction}} to Six Paths, a Rinnegan gives its <b>user</b> <b>access</b> to {{a special}} path called the , which allows the user to control the aspect of life and death. Nagato used this Path to devise a means to animate six corpses, each with a sixth of his full power, that he could control through first-person view. The user can also use special chakra chains which can bind even Tailed Beasts. Lastly, the user may perform a technique called [...] to fully resurrect the dead by offering their own lives. The Sage of the Six Paths possesses a unique technique not used by anyone else called the [...] which manipulates the Yin chakra to create physical forms out of nothingness, then bestows it with life force through the Yang chakra.|$|E

2500|$|The {{solution}} was to add another grid between the screen grid and the main anode, called the suppressor grid (since it suppressed secondary emission current toward the screen grid). This grid {{was held at the}} cathode (or [...] "ground") voltage and its negative voltage (relative to the anode) electrostatically repelled secondary electrons so that they would be collected by the anode after all. This three-grid tube is called a pentode, meaning five electrodes. The pentode was invented in 1926 by Bernard D. H. Tellegen and became generally favored over the simple tetrode. Pentodes are made in two classes: those with the suppressor grid wired internally to the cathode (e.g. EL84/6BQ5) and those with the suppressor grid wired to a separate pin for <b>user</b> <b>access</b> (e.g. 803, 837). An alternative solution for power applications is the beam tetrode or [...] "beam power tube", discussed below.|$|E
2500|$|Data Redirection: Also {{known as}} data virtualization, this virtualizes the {{registry}} and {{certain parts of}} the file system for applications running in the protected user context if User Account Control is turned on, enabling legacy applications to run in non-administrator accounts. It automatically creates private copies of files that an application can use when it does not have permission to access the original files. This facilitates stronger file security and helps applications not written with the least <b>user</b> <b>access</b> principle in mind to run under stronger restrictions. Registry virtualization isolates write operations that have a global impact to a per-user location. Reads and writes in the HKLM\Software section of the Registry by user-mode applications while running as a standard user, as well as to folders such as [...] "Program Files", are [...] "redirected" [...] to the user's profile. The process of reading and writing on the profile data and not on the application-intended location is completely transparent to the application.|$|E
2500|$|Leet {{originated}} within {{bulletin board}} systems (BBS) in the 1980s, where having [...] "elite" [...] status on a BBS allowed a <b>user</b> <b>access</b> to file folders, games, and special chat rooms. [...] The Cult of the Dead Cow hacker collective has {{been credited with}} the original coining of the term, in their text-files of that era. [...] One theory {{is that it was}} developed to defeat text filters created by BBS or Internet Relay Chat system operators for message boards to discourage the discussion of forbidden topics, like cracking and hacking. Creative misspellings and ASCII-art-derived words were also a way to attempt to indicate one was knowledgeable about the culture of computer users. Once the reserve of hackers, crackers, and script kiddies, leet has since entered the mainstream. It is now also used to mock newbies, or newcomers, on web sites, or in gaming communities. Some consider emoticons and ASCII art, like smiley faces, to be leet, while others maintain that leet consists of only symbolic word encryption. More obscure forms of leet, involving the use of symbol combinations and almost no letters or numbers, continue to be used for its original purpose of encrypted communication. It is also sometimes used as a script language. Variants of leet have been used for censorship purposes for many years; for instance [...] "@$$" [...] (ass) and [...] "$#!+" [...] (shit) are frequently seen to make a word appear censored to the untrained eye but obvious to a person familiar with leet.|$|E

50|$|<b>User</b> <b>access</b> enables {{users to}} assume a {{specific}} digital identity across applications, which enables access controls to be assigned and evaluated against this identity. The use of a single identity for a given user across multiple systems eases tasks for administrators and users. It simplifies access monitoring and verification and allows the organization to minimize excessive privileges granted to one user. <b>User</b> <b>access</b> can be tracked from initiation to termination of <b>user</b> <b>access.</b>|$|E

It takes care for <b>user</b> <b>access,</b> provide <b>user</b> <b>access</b> according to current business roles, and manage passwords with self-service capabilities and approval workflows. Also when a user is leaving the organization it automatically deprovisions <b>user</b> <b>access</b> rights.
