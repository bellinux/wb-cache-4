5|$|During World War II civil {{aerodromes}} {{were taken}} over for military <b>use,</b> <b>existing</b> military airfields were expanded, and new ones were built. This {{resulted in a}} significant inventory of facilities becoming available after the war. Pre-war civil aerodromes, for example Sywell, were returned to civilian use. Surplus military airfields were closed, and in some cases, for example Beccles, subsequently re-opened as civil aerodromes. The Ministry of Civil Aviation was created to regulate all civil aviation in the UK, and this task remained the responsibility of government departments until {{the establishment of the}} independent CAA in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock (initially {{referred}} to as Guitar Hero 6 or Guitar Hero VI) is a music video game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision. It was the sixth main entry in the Guitar Hero series, and was released in September 2010 for PlayStation 3, Wii (ported by Vicarious Visions), and Xbox 360. Similar to previous entries in the franchise, it is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to <b>use</b> <b>existing</b> compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Hordaland County Council {{decided that}} an {{extension}} of the Bergen Light Rail to Sotra was to be made part of the extension plans in the period until 2040. For the light rail to <b>use</b> <b>existing</b> infrastructure, a bridge would have to be chosen. The road project has been criticized by environmentalists because it uniformly bases growth in transport to the archipelago based on cars, and lacks any plans for inclusion of public transport, whether by light rail or as bus lanes. Criticism has also been raised against the Norwegian Public Roads Administration being responsible for planning the public transport, as they have failed to produce efficient public transport systems in Bergen.|$|E

5|$|Pre-1927 Route 10 was legislated in 1916 to {{run from}} Paterson east by way of Hackensack and Ridgefield to the Public Service Railway's Fort Lee Ferry at Edgewater. From Paterson it used the {{existing}} Paterson and Hackensack Turnpike (Market Street and Essex Street) to Hackensack and the Bergen Turnpike (Hudson Street) to Ridgefield. Rather than <b>use</b> <b>existing</b> roads from Ridgefield down the Palisades to Edgewater, a whole new route was surveyed with better grades. This road was built by 1922. At its east end, Route 10 ran south several blocks on River Road to the ferry, just south of Dempsey Avenue. In Ridgefield, Broad Avenue was used to get between the new alignment and Bergen Turnpike.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 747 is a large, {{wide-body}} (two-aisle) airliner {{with four}} wing-mounted engines. The wings {{have a high}} sweep angle of 37.5 degrees for a fast, efficient cruise of Mach0.84 to 0.88, depending on the variant. The sweep also reduces the wingspan, allowing the 747 to <b>use</b> <b>existing</b> hangars. Seating capacity is more than 366 with a 3–4–3 seat arrangement (a cross section of 3 seats, an aisle, 4 seats, another aisle, and 3 seats) in economy class and a 2–3–2 arrangement in first class on the main deck. The upper deck has a 3–3 seat arrangement in economy class and a 2–2 arrangement in first class.|$|E
5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom {{high-speed}} cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} <b>use</b> <b>existing</b> equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E

5|$|Guitar Hero 5 (initially {{referred}} to as Guitar Hero V) is a music rhythm game and the fifth main entry in the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to <b>use</b> <b>existing</b> compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players {{across a range of}} skill levels {{to be able to play}} cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.|$|E
5|$|The G3s {{incorporated}} several novel {{features for}} dreadnought-era capital ships, {{or at least}} for British designs of this type. Most immediately noticeable was the concentration of the main battery forward of the bridge and engineering spaces, giving the ships a tanker-like appearance. Since the G3s were to <b>use</b> <b>existing</b> dockyard facilities, this layout allowed designers to keep {{the length of the}} ships, as well as the weight of armour, to a minimum. The resulting loss of heavy fire astern was considered justifiable since the ships were intended to fight on the broadside. A related feature of the G3 and N3 designs was their tower bridge structure behind the first two gun turrets. This provided a better and more stable foundation for fire-control equipment, greatly improved accommodation and protection from the weather.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{official}} guidelines {{yet on the}} use of disease-modifying oral treatments due to their recent development. While some believe that they will probably reduce the usage of first-line treatments the long-term safety of interferons and glatiramer acetate will probably slow this trend. It has been recommended that at the moment oral treatments should be mainly offered in those cases where patients do not <b>use</b> <b>existing</b> treatments due to needle phobia or other reasons such as perceived inefficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate. They could also be used in patients taking natalizumab who have developed JC virus antibodies and are therefore at an increased risk of PML. Dimethyl fumarate is potentially {{one of the most interesting}} oral drugs due to the long term data from use in psoriasis which points towards a very good safety profile.|$|E

25|$|The IOC has {{stressed}} that the main goal of these games is not competition, but education based on Olympic values.

25|$|The EU {{has five}} key points in its energy policy: {{increase}} {{competition in the}} internal market, encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems {{to respond to a}} crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in Central Asia and North Africa; <b>use</b> <b>existing</b> energy supplies more efficiently while increasing renewable energy commercialisation; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.|$|E
25|$|Three designs {{incorporating}} some {{of these}} features were studied. One was essentially an X band adaptation of the otherwise unmodified Mk. VIII, operating at 3cm, the second was a Mk. VIII that adopted the spiral-scan technique instead of helical, and the third was the AIF system being developed by Lovell. After some discussion, the X band concept was dropped; they concluded that RAF familiarity with S band equipment, along {{with the ability to}} <b>use</b> <b>existing</b> beacons, outweighed any technical advantages.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{underground}} reservoirs has been investigated. Recent {{examples include the}} proposed Summit project in Norton, Ohio, the proposed Maysville project in Kentucky (underground limestone mine), and the Mount Hope project in New Jersey, which was to have used a former iron mine as the lower reservoir. Several new underground pumped storage projects have been proposed. Cost-per-kilowatt estimates for these projects can be lower than for surface projects if they <b>use</b> <b>existing</b> underground mine space. There are limited opportunities involving suitable underground space, but the number {{of underground}} pumped storage opportunities may increase if abandoned coal mines prove suitable.|$|E
