5|$|In the National Football League (NFL), a tied game {{occurs when}} a regular season game ends with both teams having an equal score. Since the National Hockey League {{eliminated}} ties by adopting the shootout following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the NFL {{is the only one}} of the four major professional sports leagues in North America to have tied games in regular-season play, as Major League Baseball (in the modern era since 1900) and the National Basketball Association have historically played <b>until</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a winner. Unlike soccer (association football), in which teams routinely play for a draw (for the benefit of a point in the standings), NFL teams rarely play for ties. In general, tied games in the NFL are frowned upon by both teams and fans. Because tied games are rare, some players have not known they were allowed in the NFL, such as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who said after a tie game against the Cincinnati Bengals that he did not know a tie was a possible result.|$|E

25|$|Transvenous pacing, {{when used}} for {{temporary}} pacing, {{is an alternative}} to transcutaneous pacing. A pacemaker wire is placed into a vein, under sterile conditions, and then passed into either the right atrium or right ventricle.

It can be kept in place until a permanent pacemaker is implanted or <b>until</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no longer {{a need for a}} pacemaker and then it is removed.|$|E

25|$|A {{gene probe}} for rpoB is {{available}} in some countries and this serves as a useful marker for MDR-TB, because isolated RMP resistance is rare (except when patients {{have a history of}} being treated with rifampicin alone). If the results of a gene probe (rpoB) are known to be positive, then it is reasonable to omit RMP and to use SHEZ+MXF+cycloserine. The reason for maintaining the patient on INH despite the suspicion of MDR-TB is that INH is so potent in treating TB that it is foolish to omit it <b>until</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> microbiological proof that it is ineffective.|$|E
