The Concertación selected former president Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle as their candidate, while the Alianza chose former presidential candidate Sebastián Piñera, who {{is supported by the}} newly created Coalition for Change electoral group. The far-left Juntos Podemos Más pact selected former Socialist Party member Jorge Arrate as its candidate. Another former Socialist party member, deputy Marco Enríquez-Ominami (MEO), ran as independent.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the cooperative activity between <b>national</b> labor <b>unions</b> <b>and</b> <b>national</b> environmental {{organizations in the}} United States on issues associated with globalization. Past researchers have advocated the need for organizations that makeup the labor and environmental movements to work together, but do they? It is hypothesized that globalization issues may be a key factor for cooperative activity between <b>national</b> labor <b>unions</b> <b>and</b> <b>national</b> environmental organizations. The conducted research does find some evidence to support this claim. Industrial labor <b>unions</b> <b>and</b> politically oriented environmental organizations appear to be most active in working together on globalization issues. Associated with working together {{is the need for}} organizations to adopt a social justice frame that other organizations can support. The article concludes with a discussion of the importance of permanent, federative arrangements between <b>national</b> labor <b>unions</b> <b>and</b> <b>national</b> environmental organizations...|$|R

2500|$|Prior to the Constitution, the {{thirteen}} states were bound {{together by the}} Articles of Confederation. These were in essence a military alliance between sovereign nations adopted to better fight the Revolutionary War. Congress had no power to tax, {{and as a result}} was not able to pay debts resulting from the Revolution. Madison, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin and others feared a break-up of the <b>union</b> <b>and</b> <b>national</b> bankruptcy. Like Washington, Madison felt the revolution had not resolved the social problems that had triggered it, and the excesses ascribed to the King were now being repeated by the state legislatures. In this view, Shays' Rebellion, an armed uprising in Massachusetts in 1786, was simply one, albeit extreme, example of [...] "democratic excess" [...] {{in the aftermath of the}} War ...|$|E
2500|$|African Americans {{were often}} {{involved}} in the Civil Rights Movement and the antiwar movement. Martin Luther King, Jr., James Bevel of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and Muhammad Ali were prominent opponents of the Vietnam War, and the Black Panther Party vehemently opposed U.S. involvement in Vietnam. In {{the beginning of the}} war, some African Americans did not want to join the war opposition movement because of loyalty to President Johnson for pushing Civil Rights legislation, but soon the escalating violence of the war and the perceived social injustice of the draft propelled involvement in antiwar groups. Black antiwar groups opposed the war for the same reason as white groups, but often protested in separate events and did not cooperate with the ideas of white antiwar leadership. They harshly criticized the draft because poor and minority men were usually most affected by conscription although the Washington Post in a 1986 in depth examination of who actually fought the Vietnam War entitled [...] "The Myth of the Vietnam Vet" [...] contradicted this assertion. According to the Post, [...] "The man who fought in Vietnam is typically depicted as a draftee, unwilling and probably black. In fact, 73 percent of those who died were volunteers and 12.5 percent were black (out of an age group that comprised 13.5 percent of the male population)." [...] African Americans {{involved in the}} antiwar movement often formed their own groups, such as Black Women Enraged, National Black Anti-War Anti-Draft <b>Union,</b> <b>and</b> <b>National</b> Black Draft Counselors. Within these groups, however, many African American women were seen as subordinate members by black male leaders. Many African American women viewed the war in Vietnam as racially motivated and sympathized strongly with Vietnamese women. Such concerns often propelled their participation in the antiwar movement and their creation of new opposition groups.|$|E

6000|$|Any {{words about}} Tennyson as a {{politician}} are apt to excite the sleepless prejudice which haunts the political field. He probably, if forced to [...] "put a name to it," [...] would have called himself a Liberal. But {{he was not a}} social agitator. He never set a rick on fire. [...] "He held aloof, in a somewhat detached position, from the great social seethings of his age" [...] (Mr Frederic Harrison). But in youth he helped to extinguish some flaming ricks. He spoke of the [...] "many-headed beast" [...] (the reading public) in terms borrowed from Plato. He had no higher esteem for mobs than Shakespeare or John Knox professed, while his theory of tyrants (in the case of Napoleon III. about 1852) was that of Liberals like Mr Swinburne and Victor Hugo. Though to modern enlightenment Tennyson may seem as great a Tory as Dr Johnson, yet he had spoken his word in 1852 for the freedom of France, and for securing England against the supposed designs of a usurper (now fallen). He really believed, obsolete as the faith may be, in guarding our own, both on land and sea. Perhaps no Continental or American critic has ever yet dispraised a poetical fellow-countryman merely for urging the duties of national <b>union</b> <b>and</b> <b>national</b> defence. A critic, however, writes thus of Tennyson: [...] "When our poet descends into the arena of party polemics, in such things as Riflemen, Form! Hands all Round, [...] . The Fleet, and other topical pieces dear to the Jingo soul, it is not poetry but journalism." [...] I doubt whether the desirableness of the existence of a volunteer force and of a fleet really is within the arena of PARTY polemics. If any party thinks that we ought to have no volunteers, and that it is our duty to starve the fleet, what is that party's name? Who cries, [...] "Down with the Fleet! Down with National Defence! Hooray for the Disintegration of the Empire!"? ...|$|E
6000|$|Naples has a {{government}} {{as bad as}} anarchy; Rome unites the evils [...] of the worst government and the most entire anarchy. In those [...] countries I can hardly imagine any change {{that would not be}} for [...] the better. But in the wild opinions of some of your political [...] sectaries, I see the best and most available defence of the [...] existing system with its hideous mischiefs. Almost every Italian [...] who heartily desires the removal from Italy and from the face of [...] the earth of the immeasurable evils which your country now suffers [...] through some of its governments, adopts Italian <b>union</b> <b>and</b> <b>national</b> [...] independence for his watchwords.... Do not think it presumption, [...] for it is the mere description of a fact, if I say, we in England [...] cannot bring our minds to this mode of looking at the Italian [...] question. All our habits, all our instincts, all our history lead [...] us in another direction. In our view this is not building from the [...] bottom upwards, but from the top downwards.... All our experience [...] has been to the effect that the champion of liberty should take [...] his ground, not upon any remote or abstract proposition, but upon [...] the right of man, under every law divine and human, first to good [...] government, and next to the institutions which are the necessary [...] guarantees of it.... We sympathise strongly, I believe, with the [...] victims of misgovernment, but the English mind is not shocked in [...] limine at the notion of people belonging to one race and [...] language, yet politically incorporated or associated with another; [...] and of Italian unity, I think the language of this nation would [...] be, We shall be glad if it proves to be feasible, but the [...] condition of it must be gradually matured by a course of [...] improvement in the several states, and by the political education [...] of the people; if it cannot be reached by these means, it hardly [...] will be by any others; and certainly not by opinions which closely [...] link Italian reconstruction with European disorganisation and [...] general war.|$|E
