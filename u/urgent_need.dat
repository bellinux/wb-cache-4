40|$|AbstractThis research, {{conducted}} in the Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC), examined systems engineering and engineering management practices for military rapid capability and <b>urgent</b> <b>needs</b> programs. Lifecycle of <b>urgent</b> <b>needs</b> programs is driven by “time to market” as opposed to complete satisfaction of static requirements, with delivery expected in months versus years/decades. The processes and practices applied to <b>urgent</b> <b>needs</b> must add value and not require an excessive bureaucratic oversight to implement, {{while at the same}} time address, understand, and manage risk such that programs can understand better where to include, truncate, eliminate, tailor, or scale systems engineering practices and processes. Focusing on aspects of the product, process, and people of military rapid organizations, the analysis showed that these organizations have the right team, develop innovative conceptual solutions, quickly prune the design space, and identify appropriate designs that can deliver warfighting capability expeditiously. While these observations may not seem new, they provide the foundation for a broader framework of rapid development, which is the subject of ongoing research...|$|R

5|$|Harmless and docile, the thornback {{guitarfish}} can {{be readily}} approached underwater, and fares well in public aquariums. Off the United States, this ray is common and faces no substantial threats: it is only occasionally caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers, and has no economic value. As most of its range lies within US waters, the species has been assessed as Least Concern overall by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, in Mexican waters the thornback guitarfish population is small and fragmented, {{and the degree to}} which it is affected by fishing is uncertain.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses the challenges that the Department of Defense (DOD) faces in fulfilling <b>urgent</b> operational <b>needs</b> identified by our warfighters. Over {{the course of the}} wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, U. S. forces have encountered changing adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures, which challenged DOD to quickly develop and provide new equipment and new capabilities to address evolving threats. Further, U. S. troops faced shortages of critical items, including body armor, tires, and batteries. DOD's goal is to provide solutions as quickly as possible to meet <b>urgent</b> warfighter <b>needs</b> to prevent mission failure or loss of life. To meet its <b>urgent</b> <b>needs,</b> DOD had to look beyond traditional acquisition procedures, expand the use of existing processes, and develop new processes and entities designed to be as responsive as possible to urgent warfighter requests. In addition to requests for equipment from DOD's existing stocks, warfighters have requested new capabilities, such as: technology to counter improvised explosive devices (IED); technology related to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) to provide increased situational awareness; and equipment related to command and control to enhance operations on the battlefield. In meeting <b>urgent</b> <b>needs,</b> it is important for DOD to efficiently use the department's financial resources. DOD has spent billions of dollars {{over the past several years}} to address <b>urgent</b> warfighter <b>needs.</b> Our past work on weapons acquisition has shown that the department has often pursued more programs than its resources can support. Additionally, our past work also has shown that DOD has had difficulty translating needs into programs, which often has led to cost growth and delayed delivery of needed capabilities to the warfighter. Today, we are publicly releasing a report that addresses (1) what entities exist within DOD for responding to <b>urgent</b> operational <b>needs,</b> and the extent to which there is fragmentation, overlap, or duplication; (2) the extent to which DOD has a comprehensive approach for managing and overseeing its <b>urgent</b> <b>needs</b> activities; and (3) the extent to which DOD has evaluated the potential for consolidations of its various activities and entities. This statement will first briefly discuss challenges we reported in April 2010 that affected the overall responsiveness of DOD's <b>urgent</b> <b>needs</b> processes and then highlight the key findings and recommendations of today's report. Today's report contributed to our findings in another report being released today that addresses opportunities to reduce potential duplication in government programs. ...|$|R
