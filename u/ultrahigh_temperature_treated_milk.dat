40|$|Psychrotrophic {{bacteria}} in raw milk produce heat-resistant extracellular proteases, resulting in spoilage and shelf-life reduction of <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>treated</b> <b>milk</b> and milk products. Controlling of these spoilage microbes requires rapid and reliable identification systems for screening of raw milk. This study aimed to compare commercial bacterial identification systems with a genetic method (considered as the 'gold standard' method) for {{the identification of}} heat-resistant protease producing {{bacteria in}} raw milk. Five bacterial identification systems were compared based on typability, discrimination power (i. e. Simpson's Index of Diversity), reproducibility and speed of analysis. The accuracy of 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, Biolog, MALDI-TOF MS, API, and Microbact for the identification of Gram negative bacilli at the species level was 100. 0 %, 86. 8 %, 63. 2 %, 60. 5 % and 57. 9 %, respectively. The Gram positive bacilli were identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, Biolog, MALDI-TOF MS, and API with accuracies at the species level of 100. 0 %, 85. 0 %, 95. 0 % and 90. 0 %, respectively. The 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis discriminated Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas syringae, Hafnia alvei, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus licheniformis to the subspecies level. The Simpson's Index of Diversity scores were 0. 966, 0. 711, 0. 496, 0. 472, and 0. 140, for 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, Biolog, MALDI-TOF MS, API and Microbact, respectively. Limited reference profiles in the databases of Biolog, MALDI-TOF MS, API and Microbact systems reduced their accuracy in bacterial identification, compared to 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The rapidity of each assay is in the following order; MALDI-TOF MS. >. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. >. Biolog. >. Microbact. >. API. The reproducibility of the assays is {{in the order of}} 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. >. API. >. Microbact. >. MALDI-TOF MS. >. Biolog. Thus, 16 S rRNA gene sequencing appears to be the most reliable and robust system for the identification of dairy spoilage bacteria. The Biolog system is suitable for the identification of Gram negative spoilage bacteria, while MALDI-TOF MS and API systems are suitable for the identification of Gram positive spoilage bacteria isolated from raw milk. The commercial systems used in this study have been developed and extensively used for the identification of clinical microbes but {{only a limited number of}} studies used those systems to identify the environmental microorganisms that often contaminate raw milk. Therefore, comparison of those systems for the identification of spoilage microbes in raw milk would provide better understanding of their suitability for routine dairy microbiology and more extensive dairy research...|$|E

AFM 1 was detected in 79 (73. 8 %) of milk samples, ranging from < 0. 02 to 0. 26 mug/L. The samples were analyzed using an immunoaffinity column for cleanup and a thin layer chromatography for determining AFM 1. The parameters, such as recovery, repeatibility, detection and quantification limit were evaluated to optimize this method (in-house). Based on spiked samples, the recovery values ranged from 85. 83 to 73. 86 % at levels of 0. 010 - 0. 50 mug/L, respectively, and the relative standard deviation for repeatibility ranged from 7. 73 to 2. 08 %. The quantification limit was 0. 02 mug/L. The results of some samples analyzed by this method demonstrated a satisfatory correlation when compared with High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). In conclusion, immunoaffinity column cleanup gave excellent results for recovery, sensibility and sample through put.

FUHT and RUHT milks were processed similarly, except for homogenization. Both milks underwent excessive fat separation, but it was less in RUHT milk than in FUHT milk, due mainly to higher homogenization efficiency {{and the addition of}} stabilizer emulsifier to the former. Most FUHT and RUHT milk samples showed significant changes in all characteristics studied. The extent of the changes increased with storage time and temperature, except for the viscosity of RUHT milk, which increased more at low temperature. The rates of change in pH, milk reducing substances and sensory quality were higher in RUHT milk than in FUHT milk. However, the rates of change in itrable acidity, ADV, proteolysis and sedimentation were similar in both types of milk. The major causes of low sensory quality of stored RUHT milk were non-enzymatic browning and lipolysis. In general, the quality of UHT milk stored under hot climatic conditions might not be acceptable after 6 months. Therefore, storage in air-conditioned stores or reduction of the UHT milk storage period is recommended...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on microbiological quality of milk for cheese production. Besides that, it informs about the composition of milk and the processes in cheese production. The composition of milk differs between animal species. Lactose is the main sugar of milk, with content about 4 - 8 %. The majority of fat found in milk is triacylglycerol type. Casein {{is the most important}} protein, which occurs in three fractions (alpha, beta a kappa). Milk also contains various minerals and vitamins. The most important mineral is calcium, which {{plays an important role in}} cheese production. The milk composition is a suitable environment for the growth of microorganisms (Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, etc.), that can contaminate raw milk. Despite this risk, the raw milk is commonly used for cheese production, because it gives the cheese better structure and taste compared with the <b>treated</b> <b>milk.</b> However, the majority of cheeses are manufactured from the <b>treated</b> <b>milk.</b> In most cases, the <b>milk</b> is <b>treated</b> by heat, especially by pasteurization and <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>temperature.</b> These procedures kill microorganisms in milk. In some cases, milk can be contaminated again after the treatment or by inactive spores that survived the treatment. They can become active under favourable conditions, for example during cheese making. Cheeses can be divided into groups by several criteria (type of coagulation, water content or fat content in dry matter). Starting cultures are used during cheese making from <b>treated</b> <b>milk.</b> Thermophilic starting culture Lactobacillus casei is used for manufacturing of soft cheeses and cheeses with high-heated curd. Cheeses with holes are made by fermentation (Propionibacterium freudenreichii). Mesophilic bacteria Lactobacillus lactis are used for production of cheeses with low-heated curd. There are many other cultures used in cheese making. Another important process during a cheese making is coagulation. During this process, the milk fat is coagulated by enzymes (chymosin, pepsin). After the coagulation, the curd is cut and forms soft grains, which exude whey. The grains are often heated for the better whey secretion. Salt is used during the cheese production to slow the activity of microorganisms and enzymes and it also gives better taste to the final product. Cheese is then let to age, during this period of time, biochemical processes occur and unique characteristics of the cheese are gained...|$|R

Several types of natural and industrial sorbents have been analyzed by considering their effects {{on the quality of}} the <b>treated</b> <b>milk</b> and their removal efficiencies. <b>Treated</b> <b>milk</b> characterization tests in terms of organic acids, lactose, chlorides, pH and protein contents show a moderate alteration of the milk properties proportionally with the sorbent dosage. On the other hand, experimental evidences reveal that the highest removal efficiencies (η > 90 % for AFMs = 0. 5 μg/kg) have been obtained for the activated carbons due to the concurrent effects of high surface area, sufficiently wide micropore size and higher affinity between the AFM molecules and the aromatic structure of the carbons. Also the bentonite shows significant removal efficiency, combined with lower side effects on the <b>treated</b> <b>milk.</b> Therefore, this preliminary analysis shows that an optimization of sorbent dosage should be considered to account for both a reliable detoxification of the milk and for assuring the acceptability of the <b>treated</b> <b>milk</b> in light of its direct reuse for human consumption or as raw material for dairy products...|$|R

In this regard, a non-wetting behavior and low reactivity are the main criteria determining the applicability of ceramic as a potential crucible material for long-term <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>temperature</b> contact with molten silicon. In this work, the wetting of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) by molten silicon was examined {{for the first time}} at temperatures up to 1750 C.

The characteristic mineral assemblage of the granulites consists of Pl + Opx + Qtz ± Cpx ± Bt ± Grt ± Kfs. Based on abundant magmatic relic microstructural domains occurring in these rocks, the potential precursors might have been predominantly felsic igneous or high to <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>temperature</b> rocks. Ternary feldspar thermometry provides a rough estimate of temperatures of about 920 - 1070 °C. The first fluid invasion event, which is linked with this early high to <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>temperature</b> stage is characterised by primary pure CO 2 inclusions in apatite and zircon. The densest primary CO 2 inclusions indicate 0. 52 - 0. 64 GPa pressure at the estimated temperature range of crystallization. According to mineral equilibria and geothermobarometry, the high to <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>temperature</b> rock cooled and crystallized to granulite of predominantly felsic composition at about 750 - 870 °C and 0. 50 - 0. 75 GPa in the middle crust, between 20 and 29 km depths. The second fluid invasion event is recorded by primary CO 2 -rich fluid inclusions hosted in the granulitic mineral assemblage (plagioclase, quartz and orthopyroxene). In addition to CO 2, Raman spectroscopy revealed the presence of minor N 2, H 2 S, CO and H 2 O in these inclusions. Partial melting of biotite-bearing assemblages could {{be connected to the}} next fluid invasion shown by secondary CO 2 -rich fluids recorded along with healed fractures in plagioclase, clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene. This event could have happened at depths similar to the previous ones. The final step in the granulite evolution was the sampling in the middle crust and transportation to the surface in form of xenoliths by mafic melt. This event generated temperature increase and pressure decrease and thus, limited melting of the xenoliths. The youngest fluid inclusion generation, observed mostly in healed fractures of felsic minerals, could be associated with this event. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien...|$|R

Altogether, these observations which span more than 2 Ga, tend to suggest that successive mantle plume heads beneath Tanzania followed a similar history, promoting partial melting {{on one side of the}} craton and deep burying of crustal material on the other. Numerical modelling of plume head-cratonic blocks interactions was performed with a tectonically realistic formulation for the cratonic lithosphere. Topographic signatures reveal elevated plateaus above cratons while undulations are observed between cratons, as observed in east Africa. Two different types of lithospheric downwellings (the «drip-like» and the «slab-like» instabilities), show P-T paths that may explain how <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>temperature</b> metamorphism occurs. The results tend to confirm that channelized flow of plume head beneath cratons would favour crustal melting on one side and lithospheric delamination on the other. Focusing of shear stress at cratonic margins enables fluid circulation and promotes metasomatism. While plume edges escape to thinner lithosphere, material from the plume centre is stored beneath the craton until the subsequent mantle plume following a similar mantle path interacts again with the craton...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ultrahigh</b> <b>temperature</b> {{ceramics}} (UHTC) {{have performed}} unreliably due to material flaws and attachment design. These deficiencies {{are brought to}} the fore by the low fracture toughness and thermal shock resistance of the UHTC. If these deficiencies are overcome, we are still faced with poor oxidation resistance as a limitation on UHTC applicability to reusable launch vehicles. We have been addressing the deficiencies of UHTC {{for the past two}} years via a small task at GRC that is in the Airframe part of the Next Generation Launch Technology Program. Our focus is on composite constructions and functional grading to address the mechanical issues and on composition modification to address the oxidation issue. The progress on approaches to improving oxidation resistance by alloying and functional grading will be reported...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ultrahigh</b> <b>temperature</b> {{ceramics}} (UHTCs) such as diborides of zirconium, hafnium tantalum {{and their}} composites {{are considered to}} be the candidate materials for thermal protection systems of hypersonic vehicles due to their exceptional combination of physical, chemical and mechanical properties. A composite of ZrB 2 -TiB 2 is expected to have better properties. In this study, an attempt has been made to fabricate ZrB 2 -TiB 2 ceramics using mechanically activated elemental powders followed by reactive spark plasma sintering (RSPS) at 1400 °C. Microstructure and phase analysis was carried out using X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and electron microscopy to understand microstructure evolution. Fracture toughness and hardness were evaluated using indentation methods. Nanoindentation was used to measure elastic modulus. Compressive strength of the composites has been reported...|$|R
40|$|Rare-earth calcium oxyborate crystals, ReCa 4 O(BO 3) 3 (ReCOB, Re = Er, Y, Gd, Sm, Nd, Pr, and La), are {{potential}} piezoelectric materials for <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>temperature</b> sensor applications, {{due to their}} high electrical resistivity at elevated temperature, high piezoelectric sensitivity and temperature stability. In this paper, different techniques for ReCOB single-crystal growth are introduced, including the Bridgman and Czochralski pulling methods. Crystal orientations and {{the relationships between the}} crystallographic and physical axes of the monoclinic ReCOB crystals are discussed. The procedures for dielectric, elastic, electromechanical and piezoelectric property characterization, taking advantage of the impedance method, are presented. In addition, the maximum piezoelectric coefficients for different piezoelectric vibration modes are explored, and the optimized crystal cuts free of piezoelectric cross-talk are obtained by rotation calculations...|$|R
