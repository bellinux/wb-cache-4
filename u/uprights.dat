40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that, after bed rest, maximal oxygen consumption (VO₂max) decreases more <b>upright</b> than supine, because of adequate cardiovascular response supine, but not <b>upright.</b> On 9 subjects, we determined VO₂max and maximal cardiac output (Q) <b>upright</b> and supine, {{before and after}} (reambulation day <b>upright,</b> the following day supine) 35 -day bed rest, by classical steady state protocol. Oxygen consumption, heart rate (f(H)) and stroke volume (Q(st)) were measured by a metabolic cart, electrocardiography and Modelflow from pulse pressure profiles, respectively. We computed Q as f(H) times Q(st), and systemic oxygen flow (QaO₂) as Q. times arterial oxygen concentration, obtained after haemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation measurements. Before bed rest, all parameters at maximal exercise were similar <b>upright</b> and supine. After bed rest, VO₂max was lower (p< 0. 05) than before, both <b>upright</b> (- 38. 6 %) and supine (- 17. 0 %), being 30. 8 % higher supine than <b>upright.</b> Maximal Q(st) decreased <b>upright</b> (- 44. 3 %), but not supine (+ 3. 7 %), being 98. 9 % higher supine than <b>upright.</b> Maximal Q decreased <b>upright</b> (- 45. 1 %), but not supine (+ 9. 0 %), being higher supine than <b>upright</b> (+ 98. 4 %). Maximal QaO₂ decreased <b>upright</b> (- 37. 8 %), but not supine (+ 14. 8 %), being higher (+ 74. 8 %) <b>upright</b> than supine. After bed rest, the cardiovascular response (i) did not affect VO₂max supine, (ii) partially explained the VO₂max decrease <b>upright,</b> and (iii) caused the VO₂max differences between postures. We speculate that impaired peripheral oxygen transfer and/or utilisation may explain the VO₂max decrease supine and the fraction of VO₂max decrease <b>upright</b> unexplained by cardiovascular responses...|$|R

On the first play after the turnover, Rix completed a 51-yard pass to Walker for a first down at the Tech 18-yard line. The three plays that followed netted only three yards, and Beitia was sent into the game to attempt a 35-yard field goal.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second quarter, the Hokies' defense began to stiffen. Aided by a 10-yard holding penalty against the Eagles, Matt Ryan was forced to complete a 14-yard pass on 4th-and-9 to earn a first down and keep the drive alive. Three incomplete passes followed, however, and the Eagles again settled for a field goal attempt. This time, the 37-yard kick sailed through the <b>uprights,</b> giving Boston College a 100 lead with 11:20 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's Jermaine Chaney fielded the post-score kickoff and {{returned}} it 51yards, setting up Indiana inside Tech territory. On the Hoosiers' first play, Paci completed a 34-yard pass to tight end Ross Hales for Indiana's second first down of the game. Just outside the Tech 10-yard line, Indiana was stopped short and prevented from scoring a touchdown. Indiana's head coach sent in placekicker Bill Manolopolous, whose 26-yard kick soared through the <b>uprights</b> and cut Virginia Tech's lead to 1410 with 8:47 remaining before halftime.|$|E
5|$|On the game's next play, Chapman {{passed the}} ball deep, {{toward the end}} zone. Though the pass fell incomplete, a game {{official}} called a 15-yard pass interference penalty against NC State. This moved {{the ball to the}} NC State 23-yard line and forced Tech kicker Chris Kinzer to attempt a potentially game-winning 40-yard field goal with four seconds remaining. Though NC State coach Dick Sheridan called a timeout in an attempt to ice Chris Kinzer, the kick sailed through the <b>uprights</b> and Virginia Tech won a 2524 victory as time expired.|$|E

5|$|The punt was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback, and Kansas began its first {{offensive}} possession of the game at its 20-yard line. Kansas quarterback Todd Reesing proved remarkably effective, completing six of his eightpasses during the drive and rushing for fiveyards on a quarterback scramble. Reesing drove Kansas' offense into Virginia Tech territory, but after Tech's Orion Martin sacked Reesing, Kansas was unable to gain another first down and kicker Scott Webb was sent into the game to attempt a 44-yard field goal. Webb's kick sailed wide of the <b>uprights,</b> however, and the game remained scoreless with 6:44 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's offense {{started at}} its 20-yard line after a touchback on the kickoff. Dittoe threw two {{incomplete}} passes, was sacked, and the Hoosiers punted after going three and out. The Indiana punt {{was a poor}} one, flying out of bounds at the Indiana 28-yard line and giving Tech excellent field position. With a large lead secured, Virginia Tech backup quarterback Jim Druckenmiller came into the game for the Hokies, who were unable to gain a first down. Despite failing to advance the ball 10 yards, the excellent starting field position allowed Tech kicker Ryan Williams to attempt a 42-yard field goal, his longest kick of the season. The kick sailed through the <b>uprights,</b> and Tech extended its lead to 4513 with exactly six minutes remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{began its}} drive with an {{incomplete}} pass, which {{was followed by}} a short run. On third down, Vick prepared to throw the ball, but he was hit by Clemson defender Keith Adams and fumbled the ball. Fellow Clemson defender Terry Jolly recovered the loose football and returned it to the Tech 14-yard line before he was tackled. Following the turnover, Dantzler was stopped on a short run then threw two incomplete passes. Rather than again attempt to convert a fourth down, Bowden sent in kicker Aaron Hunt to attempt a 28-yard field goal. The kick soared through the <b>uprights,</b> and Clemson narrowed Virginia Tech's lead to 1410 with 5:45 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
40|$|<b>Upright</b> {{flanking}} faces have stronger {{detrimental effects}} on the recognition of <b>upright</b> target face, than inverted flanking faces. One possible explanation for this “flanker- inversion effect” was that the more holistically processed <b>upright</b> flanking faces allowed for more erroneous feature integration. Alternatively, crowding was known to be stronger when target and flankers were more similar. Here we investigate flanker-inversion effect on crowding in Chinese character identification. Five normally-sighted young adults participated. Targets of size 1. 2 ° were presented at 5 ° in the lower visual field. Four flankers with center-to-center distance of 1. 8 ° were presented in the crowded condition. Three types of flankers were used, <b>upright</b> or inverted Chinese and <b>upright</b> Korean characters. The identification contrast thresholds were estimated by QUEST and crowding strength was measured through threshold elevation (TE). Crowding on <b>upright</b> Chinese target was significantly stronger with inverted Chinese flankers (TE = 1. 59 ± 0. 32) than with <b>upright</b> Chinese flankers (TE = 1. 47 ± 0. 29). No inversion effect was observed for inverted Chinese target. Korean flankers produced similar crowding as <b>upright</b> Chinese flankers. Our results go against the similarity rule that predicts <b>upright</b> Chinese flankers would produce stronger crowding for <b>upright</b> Chinese target. Holistic processing preferred for inverted Chinese characters may account for the findings...|$|R

5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} second quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third-and-five from its own 20-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, quarterback Sean Glennon threw for the first down, but was intercepted at the 37-yard line by Kansas' Chris Harris. After the interception, Kansas had the ball at the Virginia Tech 31-yard line. Todd Reesing connected on a first-down pass to Derek Fine, and running back Brandon McAnderson contributed several short rushes. The Kansas offense failed to gain a second first down after the interception, however, and kicker Scott Webb was again called upon to attempt a field goal, this time from 32yards away. Unlike his first kick, the second sailed through the <b>uprights</b> for three points. With 12minutes remaining in {{the second quarter}}, Kansas extended its lead to 100.|$|E
5|$|Cincinnati's kickoff {{after the}} {{touchdown}} {{was returned to}} the Virginia Tech 24-yard line, and the Hokies prepared for their first offensive possession of the game. That play was a 27-yard run by wide receiver Dyrell Roberts, who ran an end-around for the big gain. Now on the Cincinnati side of the field, Virginia Tech running Back Darren Evans ran for one yard, then Hokies quarterback Tyrod Taylor completed a 34-yard pass to wide receiver Danny Coale. The catch gave Virginia Tech a first down at the Cincinnati 14-yard line. On the first play following the long completion, Evans was tackled for a six-yard loss, pushing the Hokies back to the Bearcats' 20-yard line. On the next two plays, Tyrod Taylor rushed {{for a total of}} 11yards, but was unable to gain another first down. Facing fourth down, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent kicker Dustin Keys into the game to attempt a 26-yard field goal. The kick sailed right of the <b>uprights,</b> however, and Virginia Tech was denied a scoring opportunity.|$|E
5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball at its 40-yard line and facing a third-and-four situation. On the first play of the quarter, Druckenmiller completed a pass to Holmes for 13 yards and a first down at the Texas 47-yard line. Once there, however, Druckenmiller threw a pass that bounced off a Tech receiver and was caught by Texas defender Jason Reeves, who returned it to the Tech 33-yard line. On the first play after the turnover, the Texas offense lost four yards on a rushing play that went out of bounds. Brown then completed a two-yard pass to Fitzgerald, setting up a long third-down play. The Longhorns were unable to earn a first down and sent in kicker Phil Dawson to attempt a 52-yard field goal. The kick attempt equaled his career long and grazed one of the <b>uprights</b> of the goal post, but the kick was successful and gave Texas a 100 lead with 13:19 remaining in the first half.|$|E

5|$|The first Eagles' {{play after}} the Tech punt was a 22-yard pass from Davis to Gunnell {{for a first}} down at the Tech 47-yard line. Following the long gain, the Eagles were unable to gain another first down, and punted back to the Hokies. The kick was fair caught at the Tech 16-yard line with 11:08 {{remaining}} in the third quarter, and the Virginia Tech offense returned to the field. Tech advanced the ball on three consecutive plays: a six-yard pass to Evans, a short rush by Evans, then a first down pass to Roberts. Following the first down, Evans ran for another first down, advancing the Hokies to their 44-yard line. Two Tech plays were stopped for little or no gain, but on third and nine, Taylor scrambled for an 18-yard gain and a first down at the Boston College 37-yard line. Evans gained six yards on first down, but the Hokies were unable to gain the next four yards. Instead of punting, Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent kicker Jared Keys into the game to attempt a field goal. Keys' 50-yard kick sailed through the <b>uprights,</b> and Tech extended its lead to 17–7 with 6:07 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
25|$|Originally the Low German house {{took its}} {{simplest}} and basic form, the Zweiständerhaus or two-post farmhouse. This had {{two rows of}} <b>uprights</b> on which the ceiling joists rested.

On the outside of the rows of <b>uprights,</b> underneath the eaves, low side rooms or bays known as Kübbungen were often built with non load-bearing external walls. These Kübbungen acted as stables or stalls for the cattle and gave this type of house its alternative name of Kübbungshaus. A classic feature of the Zweiständerhaus is that the loft is not supported by the outside walls but only by the two rows of <b>uprights</b> that form part of the hall sides or walls.|$|E
