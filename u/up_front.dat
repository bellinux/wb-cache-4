5|$|Arsenal {{lined up}} in a 4–4–2 formation; Eddie McGoldrick was {{included}} in the matchday squad, while Kevin Campbell partnered Ian Wright <b>up</b> <b>front.</b> Ferguson deployed a 4–2–4 formation, with Paul Ince partnering debutant Keane in the midfield two. Andrei Kanchelskis was picked in favour of Lee Sharpe on the left wing.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{eventually}} became popular in other European countries as well. Pugs were painted by Goya in Spain, and in Italy they rode <b>up</b> <b>front</b> on private carriages, dressed in jackets and pantaloons that matched {{those of the}} coachman. They were used by the military to track animals and people, and were also employed as guard dogs.|$|E

5|$|A shot rang out. It {{was likely}} a warning shot fired by a panicked, {{exhausted}} British soldier from the 43rd, according to Captain Laurie's report to his commander after the fight. Two other regulars then fired immediately after that, shots splashing in the river, {{and then the}} narrow group <b>up</b> <b>front,</b> possibly thinking the order to fire had been given, fired a ragged volley before Laurie could stop them.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea fielded a full-strength team, which {{lined up}} in a 4–3–3 formation; an attacking three of Didier Drogba, Damien Duff and Arjen Robben. Asier Del Horno was named as left back, which meant William Gallas moved to central defence. Wright-Phillips began the match on the {{substitute}} bench. Arsenal's line up by contrast was relatively inexperienced in midfield – Gilberto Silva was {{on the bench and}} Mathieu Flamini partnered Cesc Fàbregas in the centre. <b>Up</b> <b>front</b> Dennis Bergkamp started alongside striker Thierry Henry. The team played in a 4–4–2 formation.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea were {{expected}} to line up in a 4–4–2 formation, with Essien in central defence. They had doubts about the fitness of captain John Terry going into the final. He appeared to have damaged his ankle ligaments during {{the first leg of}} Chelsea's Champions League tie with Porto, though passed a fitness test just days after. Arsenal {{were expected}} to line up in a similar formation, with Baptista and Aliadière <b>up</b> <b>front.</b>|$|E

5|$|Christopher Reeve {{was cast}} as Superman, having {{initially}} failed {{to impress the}} Salkinds before bulking up. Brando meanwhile, despite spending {{less than two weeks}} on the shoot, and not even reading the script until then, earned $3.7million <b>up</b> <b>front,</b> plus 11.75% of the gross profits from the film. The film was a success both critically and commercially, being released during the Christmas season of 1978; it did not have much competition, leading the producers to believe that this was one factor in the film's success.|$|E
5|$|For Arsenal, Thierry Henry was {{declared}} fit {{to start and}} played alongside Dennis Bergkamp <b>up</b> <b>front.</b> 17-year-old Cesc Fàbregas partnered Gilberto Silva in central midfield, with José Antonio Reyes and Jermaine Pennant providing width on either side. Manchester United were without seven of their first-team players, including Ruud van Nistelrooy, who required surgery on his hernia. Wes Brown and Louis Saha were also ruled out because of injury, so David Bellion and Eric Djemba-Djemba came into the first team.|$|E
5|$|For Arsenal, defender Tony Adams {{was ruled}} out with injury, as was Dennis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars, and goalkeeper David Seaman. Anelka did not partake, given his {{transfer}} to Real Madrid {{was on the}} verge of being completed. New signings Oleh Luzhny and Sylvinho were both named in the squad, but whereas Sylvinho started the game, Luzhny was selected as a substitute. Arsenal, like United, lined up in a 4–4–2 formation. <b>Up</b> <b>front,</b> Fredrik Ljungberg was paired with the club's only available recognised striker, Nwankwo Kanu.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United winger Jesper Blomqvist {{was ruled}} {{out with an}} ankle injury, but Roy Keane was fit enough to start his first {{competitive}} match since damaging his ligaments eleven months previously. Defender Jaap Stam, who signed for United in May 1998, made his competitive debut for the club, partnering centre-back Ronny Johnsen. For Arsenal, new signing Nelson Vivas began the match on the substitutes' bench, in spite of being expected to make his full debut, while Dennis Bergkamp started alongside Nicolas Anelka <b>up</b> <b>front.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{the game}} neared completion, the funding began to dry up. Having {{spent more than}} $20million of their own money, Broussard and Miller asked Take-Two for $6million to {{complete}} the game. According to Broussard and Miller, Take-Two initially agreed, but then only offered $2.5million. Take-Two maintained that they offered $2.5million <b>up</b> <b>front</b> and another $2.5million on completion. Broussard rejected the counteroffer, and on May 6, 2009, suspended all development.|$|E
5|$|About 200 free {{wireless}} access points {{were set up}} around the city to aid with the city's goal of increasing access to the internet. US Internet paid $500,000 <b>up</b> <b>front</b> and agreed to pay five percent of its yearly revenues for seven years to maintain them, totaling about $10 million. By 2010, 44 such points {{had been set up}} at community centers around Minneapolis, {{out of a total of}} 117 which had also gone up in parks and on street corners around the city.

5|$|Both clubs {{lined up}} in a {{traditional}} 4–4–2 formation: a four-man defence (comprising two centre-backs and left and right full-backs), four midfielders (two in the centre, and one on each wing) and two centre-forwards. Wenger opted to pair Gilles Grimandi with Vieira in midfield and Wiltord <b>up</b> <b>front</b> with Henry, leaving Bergkamp on the substitutes' bench. Ashley Cole played in defence, ahead of Sylvinho, who did not feature in the matchday squad. For Liverpool, Houllier named Owen in the starting line-up, and chose Šmicer and Murphy to play in midfield. Gary McAllister, Patrik Berger and Fowler began the final as substitutes.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea were {{predicted}} {{to line up}} in a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Willian and Eden Hazard as wide men. Mourinho doubted the fitness of Diego Costa and Gary Cahill going into the match – the former aggravated his hamstring during a pre-season game against Barcelona. Arsenal were expected to line up similarly to Chelsea, with Walcott furthest forward and Mesut Özil in his preferred position as playmaker. Midfielder Jack Wilshere was ruled out of selection, having sustained an ankle injury during training. Arsenal's top scorer of the previous season, Alexis Sánchez, was rested, having won the 2015 Copa América with Chile earlier in the summer. The teamsheets showed Loïc Rémy starting the match for Chelsea <b>up</b> <b>front</b> and Cesc Fàbregas partnering Matic in midfield. As expected Petr Čech started in goal for Arsenal; the goalkeeper moved from Chelsea in search of first-team football.|$|E
5|$|Flight 77 was {{scheduled}} to depart for Los Angeles at 08:10; 58 passengers boarded through Gate D26, including the five hijackers.

On the flight, Hani Hanjour was seated <b>up</b> <b>front</b> in 1B, while Salem and Nawaf al-Hazmi were seated in first class in seats 5E and 5F. Majed Moqed and Khalid al-Mihdhar were seated further back in 12A and 12B, in economy class. Flight 77 left the gate on time and took off from Runway 30 at Dulles at 08:20.|$|E

Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V who inspired Anonymous to adopt the Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change {{and the need for}} change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it never goes quite as planned. The internet has no neat endings.|$|E
5|$|In the 66thminute, Alex Ferguson {{completed}} his attacking quartet by bringing Dimitar Berbatov on {{in place of}} Park. Ronaldo was penalised for a high elbow when challenging for a header with Puyol a minute later, before Rooney forced another corner off Piqué in the 69thminute. However, United's numbers <b>up</b> <b>front</b> in search of another goal left them wanting in defence; a weak clearance from Van der Sar was cut out by Puyol who played the ball to Eto'o {{on the right side}} of the penalty area. The ball broke to Xavi on the edge of the area, who crossed for Messi to send a looping header over the United goalkeeper and into the far side of the goal for a two-goal lead. Immediately after the goal, Henry was replaced by Seydou Keita, allowing Barcelona to adopt a more defensive stance.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Costa had {{competition}} <b>up</b> <b>front</b> {{from fellow}} new signings Alberto Bueno and Manucho, signed from Real Madrid and Manchester United respectively; he eventually forged {{a friendship with}} the latter, a fellow lusophone, from Angola.

He was sent off in a goalless draw against Espanyol on 24 March 2010 for a stamp on Dídac Vilà in the first half.|$|E
