2500|$|After the war, the Tuckerton Wireless Station was {{included}} in German war reparations paid to America. Shortly afterwards, it was sold to RCA which operated it until 1948 as a backup to their famous Radio Central facility in Rocky Point, New York. In 1921, RCA installed two massive Alexanderson alternators, which were removed in 1948. [...] For transatlantic communications, the radio station operated under the call signs WCI and WGG. For coastal communications, after World War I, [...] the station operated under the callsign WSC. The [...] steel tower, anchored by three large concrete blocks, was taken down on December 27, 1955. The three huge anchor blocks still exist today, in a backyard on North Ensign Drive {{and in the middle}} of South Ensign Drive and Staysail Drive. Many smaller anchor blocks providing foundations for smaller towers that supported the <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> are still visible in the lagoons. Remains of the large tower can be seen in scraps at the Giffordtown Museum.|$|E
50|$|Ring roads {{can also}} exist around radio masts {{carrying}} an <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> at the basements of the anchor {{of the wire}} of the <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> (see here), {{in order to get}} easy access to these basements. Such ring roads are usually only for internal use and closed to the public.|$|E

25|$|Goliath used three <b>umbrella</b> <b>antennae,</b> {{which were}} {{arranged}} radially around three 210 metre tall guyed steel tube masts and were insulated against ground. At their edges these antennas were mounted on grounded 170 metre tall guyed lattice steel masts. Three of these masts carried two <b>umbrella</b> <b>antennas</b> to comprise 15 lattice steel masts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Umbrella</b> <b>antennas</b> {{were invented}} during the {{wireless}} telegraphy era, about 1900 to 1920, and used with spark-gap transmitters on longwave bands to transmit information by Morse code. Small <b>umbrella</b> <b>antennas</b> were widely used with portable transmitters by military signal corps during World War I, {{since there was}} no possibility of setting up full-sized quarter-wave antennas.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Umbrella</b> <b>antennas</b> can be {{built as}} single mast antennas or as {{multiple}} mast antennas. In first case the wires connected {{to the top of}} the antenna mast are fixed at the ground, while in latter case they are fixed at masts arranged around on a circle of the central mast, which are usually smaller than the central mast and often grounded. <b>Umbrella</b> <b>antennas</b> are in common use for commercial medium-wave AM broadcasting as well as for LF and VLF transmitters for broadcasting and navigational aids. They were used at most OMEGA Navigation System transmitters, operating around 10 kHz, and at LORAN-C stations, operating at 100 kHz with central masts approximately 200 metres tall. Eight <b>umbrella</b> <b>antennas</b> 350 metres high are in use in an array at the German VLF communications facility, operating at about 20 kHz with high radiation efficiency even though they are less than 1/40 wavelength high.|$|R

5000|$|Chabrier Omega Transmitter (station E [...] ) near Chabrier on Réunion at [...] used an <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna,</b> {{installed}} on a 428-metre grounded guyed mast. The mast was demolished with explosives on 14 April 1999.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Umbrella</b> <b>antennas</b> radiate {{vertically}} polarised ground {{waves in}} an omnidirectional radiation pattern. Because they are short {{compared to a}} wavelength of the radio waves, they have low radiation resistance and are usually inefficient, radiating {{only a fraction of}} the power supplied by the transmitter.|$|R
50|$|Both masts are <b>umbrella</b> <b>antennas.</b> They are fed by an {{overhead}} cable, {{fixed to the}} mast at one end, and to a small mast near the helix building at the opposite end. As the small mast is grounded, the feeder is attached to it with an insulator in the span field.|$|R
50|$|They {{are used}} as {{transmitting}} antennas below 1 MHz, in the LF and particularly the VLF bands, at frequencies sufficiently low that it is impractical to build a full size quarter-wave monopole antenna. Either the central mast itself, insulated from the ground, {{is connected to the}} transmitter and serves as the radiating element, or vertical wires parallel to the mast. At the low frequencies used the height of the mast is typically 1/10 to 1/40 of a wavelength, so it makes a very electrically short antenna, and by itself would have very low radiation resistance and be a very inefficient radiator. The function of the umbrella-wires is to add capacitance {{to the top of the}} antenna, improving the current distribution on the vertical mast radiator to increase the radiation resistance and radiated power. The umbrella wires serve as the plate of a capacitor, with the ground serving as the other plate, which is charged and discharged by the radio frequency current from the tramsmitter. <b>Umbrella</b> <b>antennas</b> with heights of 15 to 460 metres are in service. The tallest <b>umbrella</b> <b>antennas</b> are actually used by Lualualei VLF transmitter, INS Kattabomman and the CHAYKA-transmitters at Inta and Dudinka.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to build an <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> with a grounded tower. Such an antenna requires a separate feeder to the umbrella wires, which are also insulated against the mast and the ground.|$|E
50|$|Two further masts of {{the station}} {{carrying}} an <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> are 471 metres tall and the tallest structures in India. They are also the tallest military structure in the world. The facility opened an ELF transmission facility in 2014.|$|E
50|$|Ohtakadoyayama Transmitter is an LF-time signal {{transmitter}} in Miyakoji-machi. It is {{used for}} transmitting the time signal JJY on 40 kHz. It uses as transmission antenna a 250 metre tall guyed mast with an <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna,</b> which is insulated against ground.|$|E
50|$|Omega {{stations}} used very extensive antennas {{to transmit}} at their very low frequencies (VLF). This is because wavelength is {{inversely proportional to}} frequency (wavelength in metres = 299,792,458 / frequency in Hz), and transmitter efficiency is severely degraded if {{the length of the}} antenna is shorter than 1/4 wavelength. They used grounded or insulated guyed masts with <b>umbrella</b> <b>antennas,</b> or wire-spans across both valleys and fjords. Some Omega antennas were the tallest constructions on the continent where they stood or still stand.|$|R
5000|$|The Mount Otakadoya site (...) {{is located}} at an {{elevation}} of 790 meters (2,590 ft) in Fukushima Prefecture. It broadcasts a 50 kW signal (13 kW ERP) on 40 kHz from an <b>umbrella</b> top-loading <b>antenna</b> situated 250 meters (820 ft) above the ground. In March 2011, it was powered down and evacuated due to its proximity to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. It resumed broadcasting on April 21, unattended by staff. It went off air again temporarily on April 25 due to lightning, but has ever since been on air.|$|R
40|$|Large <b>umbrella</b> space <b>antennas</b> are {{essential}} for communication, monitoring and observation of Earth and space objects. Despite investigations devoted to space antenna dynamics, the disturbance impulse shape effect on the {{root mean square error}} of spacecraft antenna reflecting surface has not been studied. This paper overcomes this gap describing disturbance impulse impact on root mean square error of spacecraftantenna reflecting surface relative to paraboloid via nonlinear finite element method. Based on numerical results root mean square dependency on disturbance time for rectangular and sine impulses was calculated. This approach could be applied in studying antenna reflecting surface response on disturbance impulse for different types of perspective large space antennas...|$|R
50|$|Haganeyama Transmitter (はがね山標準電波送信所, haganeyamahyoujyundenpasoushinjyo) is an LF-time signal {{transmitter}} at Fuji-cho, Saga-city, Saga-ken, Japan {{used for}} transmitting the time signal JJY on 60 kHz. It uses as transmission antenna, a 200 meter tall guyed mast with an <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna,</b> which is insulated against the ground.|$|E
50|$|Before World War I, the Nauen {{station was}} a {{research}} station of Telefunken. Trial service was initiated on 9 August 1906, and operational service began on 16 August 1906 using spark-gap transmitters. An <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> {{was supported by a}} steel lattice mast 100 metres high, insulated from earth.|$|E
5000|$|Ohtakadoyayama Transmitter is an LF-time signal {{transmitter}} in Miyakoji-machi (都路町 is incorrectly called [...] "Miyakoji-cho" [...] in {{the external}} link). It is used for transmitting the time signal JJY on 40 kHz. It uses as transmission antenna a 250 metre tall guyed mast with an <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna,</b> which is insulated against ground.|$|E
50|$|From the network's {{launch in}} January 2011 until May 2016, Antenna TV aired feature films under the <b>umbrella</b> title <b>Antenna</b> TV Theater. In {{addition}} to access to television series owned by Sony Pictures Television, {{the agreement with}} Sony Pictures Entertainment also included access to movies from the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group film library (including Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Sony Pictures Classics, Screen Gems, Triumph Films, and the television rights to the Embassy Pictures library). The film roster did not concentrate on films from any specific era, meaning any film from the 1930s to {{as late as the}} early 2000s could be featured on the network's schedule, although from 2014 to 2015, {{the vast majority of the}} films that aired on the network were pre-1980s releases.|$|R
5000|$|The Mount Hagane site (...) {{is located}} at an {{elevation}} of 900 meters (2,950 ft) in Saga Prefecture. It broadcasts a 50 kW signal (23 kW ERP) on 60 kHz to avoid interfering with the Otakadoya site as their signals overlap. The antenna for the Hagane site is also an <b>umbrella</b> top loading <b>antenna</b> and is situated 200 meters (650 ft) above the ground. This site {{does not have a}} redundant 40 kHz transmitter, so cannot act as a fallback for the Mount Otakadoya site.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{innovations}} of ATS-6 was an in-flight deployable antenna of more than 9 m in diameter. The antenna reflector was furled during launch under the launch vehicle fairing, and was deployed in orbit much like an <b>umbrella.</b> The <b>antenna</b> reflector was built from 48 aluminum ribs, supporting a metallized Dacron mesh. The antenna feeds (in C, S, L, UHF and VHF bands) {{were placed on the}} spacecraft body, facing the antenna reflector, and linked to the antenna and the solar panels masts by a carbon-fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) truss. The solar panels were rigidly mounted on two deployable masts. They were of hemi-cylinder shape, thus providing a relatively constant power (595 W beginning of life). Electric power was supplied during eclipses by two Nickel cadmium batteries of 15-A·h capacity, powering a regulated 30.5-V bus. The satellite dimensions in orbit were 15.8-m width by 8.2-m height.|$|R
50|$|The <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> {{was used}} for {{frequencies}} around 30 kHz, the ring antenna for frequencies around 20 kHz. In 1915 the wooden ring masts were replaced by six 122-metre-tall guyed lattice steel masts. These masts were replaced between 1922 and 1925 by four guyed masts 139 metres tall, which were arranged in a semicircle. Between these masts and the central masts three triangular antennas were installed.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was located}} at Greenbury Point, in Anne Arundel County, across the Severn River from Annapolis, Maryland at {{coordinates}} [...] NSS Annapolis {{was used by}} the USN for submarine communication. The station consisted of an <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> supported by a 1,200-foot (365.76 m) high central mast, which was insulated against ground, 6 guyed masts of 800-foot (243.84 m) and 3 freestanding towers of the same height.|$|E
50|$|DHO38 has {{transmitted}} since 1982 on 23.4 kHz with a {{power of}} up to 800 kilowatts. DHO38 uses an <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> which is carried from 8 steel tube masts with a height of 352.8 metres. Each pylon stands on 3 metre tall ceramic cylinders, which serve as insulators for voltages up to 300 kV. The masts are equipped with cylindrical oscillation dampers for better protection against storms. The transmitter is capable of transmitting signals to submarines worldwide to depths of approx. 30 metres.|$|E
50|$|Eilvese {{transmitter}} was {{a facility}} of Transradio AG for intercontinental VLF transmission of telegrams at Eilvese, Germany. It went into service in 1913 and used machine transmitters. There were two antennas: an <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna,</b> which was {{mounted in the}} middle on a 250-metre-tall guyed mast, and at the sides by six 20-metre-tall wooden masts and a ring antenna, which was spun between the central mast and the radial masts. The central mast, which was grounded, but at a height of 145 metres divided by glass insulators, was, when built, the tallest structures of Germany.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> is a top-loaded {{electrically}} lengthened monopole antenna, consisting in {{most cases}} of a mast fed at the ground end, to which a number of radial wires are connected at the top, sloping downwards. The outer end of each wire is connected by an insulator to a supporting rope or cable anchored to the ground. The radial wires can also function as guy wires to support the mast. The radial wires make the antenna look like a giant umbrella without the cloth, accounting for the name.|$|E
5000|$|For medium-wave (AM) broadcasting, quarter-wave masts {{are between}} 153 ft and 463 ft high, {{depending}} on the frequency. Because such tall masts can be costly and uneconomic, other types of antennas are often used, which employ capacitive top-loading (electrical lengthening) to achieve equivalent signal strength with vertical masts shorter than a quarter wavelength. [...] A [...] "top hat" [...] of radial wires is occasionally added {{to the top of}} mast radiators, to allow the mast to be made shorter. For local broadcast stations and amateur stations of under 5 kW, T- and L-antennas are often used, which consist of one or more horizontal wires suspended between two masts, attached to a vertical radiator wire. A popular choice for lower-powered stations is the <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna,</b> which needs only one mast one-tenth wavelength or less in height. This antenna uses a single mast insulated from ground and fed at the lower end against ground. At the top of the mast, radial top-load wires are connected (usually about six) which slope downwards at an angle of 40-45 degrees as far as about one-third of the total height, where they are terminated in insulators and thence outwards to ground anchors. Thus the <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> uses the guy wires as the top-load part of the antenna. In all these antennas the smaller radiation resistance of the short radiator is increased by the capacitance added by the wires attached {{to the top of the}} antenna.|$|E
5000|$|Paynesville Omega Transmitter (station B - [...] ) {{was inaugurated}} in 1976 and used an <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> {{mounted on a}} 417-metre steel lattice, {{grounded}} guyed mast. It was the tallest structure ever built in Africa. The station {{was turned over to}} the Liberian government after the Omega Navigation System shutdown on 30 September 1997. Access to the tower was unrestricted, and it was possible to climb the abandoned mast until it was demolished on 10 May 2011. The area occupied by the transmitter will be used to build a modern market complex that will provide additional space for local merchants and reduce congestion at Paynesville's Red Light Market, Liberia's largest food market.|$|E
5000|$|This type of {{antenna array}} {{is called a}} trideco or <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna,</b> {{one of the only}} type of antenna which can radiate power {{efficiently}} at the low 24 kHz frequency used. It functions as a capacitively top-loaded electrically short monopole antenna. Vertical wires at the central mast of the antenna radiates the VLF radio waves, while the suspended horizontal cable array functions as a large capacitor, increasing the efficiency of the vertical radiators, At the base of each mast is a star-shaped network of cables suspended a few feet above the ground, extending out hundreds of feet, called a [...] counterpoise, which serves as the bottom plate of the [...] "capacitor".|$|E
5000|$|High power {{transmitting}} antennas for VLF frequencies {{are very}} large wire antennas, up to a mile across. They {{consist of a}} series of steel radio masts, linked at the top with a network of cables, often shaped like an umbrella or clotheslines. Either the towers themselves or vertical wires serve as monopole radiators, and the horizontal cables form a capacitive top-load to increase the efficiency of the antenna. High power stations use variations on the <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> such as the [...] "delta" [...] and [...] "trideco" [...] antennas, or multiply-tuned flattop (triatic) antennas. For low power transmitters, inverted-L and T antennas are used. A large loading coil is required at the antenna feed point to cancel the capacitive reactance of the antenna to make it resonant.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the ground}} waves {{used in this}} band require {{vertical}} polarization, vertical antennas are used for transmission, usually mast radiators, either insulated {{from the ground and}} fed at the bottom, or occasionally fed through guy-wires. T-antennas and inverted L-antennas are used when antenna height is an issue. Nearly all LF antennas are electrically short, shorter than one quarter of the radiated wavelength, so their low radiation resistance makes them inefficient, requiring very low resistance grounds and conductors to avoid dissipating transmitter power. These electrically short antennas need loading coils of high inductance to bring them into resonance. Many antenna types, such as the <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> and L- and T-antenna, use capacitive top-loading (a [...] "top hat"), {{in the form of a}} network of horizontal wires attached to the top of the vertical radiator. The capacitance improves the efficiency of the antenna without increasing its height or its supporting structures.|$|E

5000|$|Station G was an Omega {{transmitter}} {{that used}} an <b>umbrella</b> <b>antenna</b> carried by a 432 m tall grounded lattice steel guyed mast. Unlike {{many of the}} other Omega Transmitters, Woodside was not a [...] "hot tower," [...] that is, one which is insulated from a ground connection by large ceramic insulators that support the entire weight of the structure. Rather, the tower was electrically insulated from the topmost guys which served as the radiators, similar to the metal radials of an umbrella without cloth covering. The mast simply supported the downward sloping guy wires which are the active elements. The guy wires were also used to hold the tower itself in place. This mast was the tallest structure in the southern hemisphere. Construction of this station was originally planned to be built in New Zealand but after protests from anti-war protestors it was built in Australia, although not without controversy. The tower was officially opened in October 1982, but had been operating for 3 months prior to that, with the first broadcast at 10am on the 16th of August, having taken 3.5 years to construct, however the tower itself having taken only 30 days to be constructed.|$|E
