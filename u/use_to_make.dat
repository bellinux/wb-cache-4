5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century was the golden age of virus {{discovery}} and most of the over 2,000 recognised species of animal, plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years. In 1957, equine arterivirus and the cause of Bovine virus diarrhoea (a pestivirus) were discovered. In 1963, the hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg, and in 1965, Howard Temin described the first retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that retroviruses <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> DNA copies of their RNA, was first described in 1970, independently by Howard Martin Temin and David Baltimore. In 1983 Luc Montagnier's team at the Pasteur Institute in France, first isolated the retrovirus now called HIV. In 1989 Michael Houghton's team at Chiron Corporation discovered Hepatitis C.|$|E
5|$|The studio {{released}} a free expansion and patch {{to the game}} on 3 June 2014, which in addition to fixing game-breaking issues, added new goat models, a new map to explore based on a seaside town with a carnival, more game-breaking issues, and local multiplayer for up to 4 players via split-screen. Ibrisagic believes that adding multiplayer support atop Steam Workshop support will allow creative users to develop new gameplay modes that will extend the title's playability. The patch also adds in additional controls that the player can <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the goat perform various freestyle tricks comparable to those in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The studio {{released a}} second free patch to the game on 20 November 2014 including elements that parody massive multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft, though remains a single player or local multiplayer experience.|$|E

The website allows visitors to read a sentence to help the machine system learn how real people speak, as well as validate the read sentences of other people.|$|E
25|$|The {{essence of}} the D/L method is 'resources'. Each team is taken to have two 'resources' to <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> as many runs as possible: the number of overs they have to receive; {{and the number of}} wickets they have in hand. At any point in any innings, a team's ability to score more runs depends on the {{combination}} of these two resources. Looking at historical scores, there is a very close correspondence between the availability of these resources and a team's final score, a correspondence which D/L exploits.|$|E
25|$|In 1887, the NYYC {{adopted the}} Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club's rating rule, in which Bristol, RI naval {{architect}} Nathanael Herreshoff found loopholes {{that he would}} <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> dramatic improvements in yacht design and to shape the America's Cup's largest and most extreme contenders. Both Herreshoff and Watson proceeded to merge Yankee sloop design and British cutter design to make very deep S-shape fin-keeled hulls. Using steel, tobin bronze, aluminium, and even nickel for novel construction, they significantly lengthened bow and stern overhangs, further extending the sailing waterline as their boats heeled over, thus increasing their speed.|$|E

25|$|Issa {{introduced}} the FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act of 2014 (H.R. 1211; 113th Congress) on March 15, 2013. It was a proposed {{bill that would}} have amended the Freedom of Information Act {{in order to make it}} easier and faster to request and receive information. The bill would have required the Office of Management and Budget to create a single FOIA website for people to <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> FOIA requests and check on the status of their request. The bill would also have created a Chief FOIA Officers Council charged with reviewing compliance and recommending improvements. It would also have required the federal agency to release the information it disclosed to the person who requested it publicly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Madden's {{stewardship}} of the NLRB came under increasing attack, however. Section 9(b) of the NLRA authorized the Board to determine the appropriate bargaining unit, but did not specify what standards to <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> that determination. The AFL had long preferred craft unionism, whereby workers were organized into unions {{on the basis of}} craft, trade, or skill. But other unions sought to organize workers on an industry-wide basis (industrial unionism) to create more powerful unions as well as to take advantage of changes in the workplace that mass production and increases in corporate size were making. The intense philosophical differences led the AFL to eject those organizations advocating industrial unionism, and these unions formed the CIO in November 1936.|$|E
25|$|Mineral {{sequestration}} aims to trap {{carbon in}} the form of solid carbonate salts. This process occurs slowly in nature and is responsible for the deposition and accumulation of limestone over geologic time. Carbonic acid in groundwater slowly reacts with complex silicates to dissolve calcium, magnesium, alkalis and silica and leave a residue of clay minerals. The dissolved calcium and magnesium react with bicarbonate to precipitate calcium and magnesium carbonates, a process that organisms <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> shells. When the organisms die, their shells are deposited as sediment and eventually turn into limestone. Limestones have accumulated over billions of years of geologic time and contain much of Earth's carbon. Ongoing research aims to speed up similar reactions involving alkali carbonates.|$|E

The Skrulls launch an assault on the Siege Perilous, preventing access into the Otherworld (Avalon) through its portal while breaking through into Otherworld via another portal located in one their ships. While in Avalon, the Skrulls gather together mystical items and convert them for their own <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a magically empowered Super Skrull to face the remaining British resistance in London. With all the magic gone from Avalon, Wisdom, in a last-ditch effort, releases the dark and evil magics along with Merlin who resurrects Captain Britain to aid the resistance.|$|E
25|$|Subjectivity {{comes with}} {{consciousness}} {{of myself as}} a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose—what rules or models is the individual going to <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.|$|E
25|$|Ligambi {{was left}} {{to deal with the}} damage Joey Merlino had done to the family's {{relationship}} with illegal bookmakers, who refused to do business with the Philadelphia crime family because Merlino <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> huge bets, then never paid when he lost. By the mid-2000s, the family consisted of approximately 50 members, half of whom were incarcerated, in addition to almost 100 associates. During Ligambi's tenure, around a dozen made men were released from prison, filling the ranks. Many of these men had been young players who fell victim to the family's unstable history and are now middle-aged. He named Anthony Staino, his closest and most loyal associate, as his underboss. Under Ligambi's direction, the family was able to muscle in on several video poker gambling machine businesses in the Philadelphia area. Merlino was released from prison on March 15, 2011, and served out his three-year parole in Florida.|$|E

500|$|Selenium (Greek σελήνη selene meaning [...] "Moon") was {{discovered}} in 1817 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Johan Gottlieb Gahn. Both chemists owned a chemistry plant near Gripsholm, Sweden, producing sulfuric acid by the lead chamber process. The pyrite from the Falun mine created a red precipitate in the lead chambers which was presumed to be an arsenic compound, so the pyrite's <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> acid was discontinued. Berzelius and Gahn {{wanted to use the}} pyrite and they also observed that the red precipitate gave off a smell like horseradish when burned. This smell was not typical of arsenic, but a similar odor was known from tellurium compounds. Hence, Berzelius's first letter to Alexander Marcet stated that this was a tellurium compound. However, the lack of tellurium compounds in the Falun mine minerals eventually led Berzelius to reanalyze the red precipitate, and in 1818 he wrote a second letter to Marcet describing a newly found element similar to sulfur and tellurium. Because of its similarity to tellurium, named for the Earth, Berzelius named the new element after the Moon.|$|E
