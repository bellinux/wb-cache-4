Taeping, also signalling for a pilot, was coming <b>up</b> <b>fast</b> and was close astern of Ariel at 5:00 am. There was no sign that Taeping would heave to, so Captain Keay ordered Ariel's sails to be filled to keep ahead of the other ship, {{to be sure of}} getting the first pilot. On Taeping Captain MacKinnon conceded and also hove to.|$|E
25|$|In Quảng Ninh, {{there are}} {{numerous}} rivers and springs, but most are short and small, and feature currents that differ between seasons. In winter, most rivers run dry; in summer, waterfalls pick <b>up</b> <b>fast</b> currents. The water current reaches 1.45 m3/s in dry season, but up to 1,500 m3/s in the rainy season. Quảng Ninh's sea borders upon the Gulf of Bắc Bộ. It is large and protected by the ranks of islands, so the wind is quieter and the water smoother. The gulf's current runs from north to south. It is Vietnam's coldest sea, with the temperature sometimes dipping below 13°C. The average tide level recorded is 2.5 m.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{differences}} in the specific heat capacity of land and water, continents heat <b>up</b> <b>faster</b> than seas.

This creates areas of low air pressure above coastal lands compared with pressure over the seas, causing winds to flow from the seas onto the neighboring lands. This is known as sea breeze.|$|R
25|$|A wicket-keeper/batsman as a schoolboy, Hall did {{not take}} <b>up</b> <b>fast</b> bowling until {{relatively}} late. He {{was included in the}} West Indies squad to tour England in 1957 having only played one match of first-class cricket. He made his Test cricket debut against India in 1958 and was instantly successful. He took a Test hat-trick in Pakistan in 1959, the first West Indian cricketer to do so. Hall bowled the final over in two famous Test matches, the Tied Test against Australia in 1960 and the Lord's Test against England in 1963. Years of non-stop cricket and resultant injury reduced Hall's effectiveness {{in the latter part of}} his Test career.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, Will and Jim {{can be said}} to have aged prematurely in the novel; {{the horrors}} of the {{carnival}} force them to grow <b>up</b> <b>fast</b> to {{be able to deal with}} its tricks on a knowledgeable level. Furthermore, Will and Jim do take a brief ride on the carousel before Will pulls Jim off, and they are never shown reversing this process before Charles destroys its machinations. Thus, it can be stated that they, in fact, grow up slightly. In this case, though, Will and Jim have also matured emotionally, too, having had their first encounter with evil. This enables them to grow more proportionally in both physical and emotional status.|$|E
25|$|Still in action, {{still moving}} with the wind away from the main fight, were Pallas and the Countess of Scarborough. Alliance was {{catching}} <b>up</b> <b>fast,</b> though, and as the near-undamaged, speedy, well-armed frigate approached, Captain Piercy understood that with seven of his own guns dismounted, four of his crew dead, twenty wounded, his rigging and sails too badly damaged to make a speedy getaway, he could neither win nor escape. With Landais hovering just beyond the range of his guns, he therefore struck his colours. Alliance approached him, seeking to take the Captain’s formal surrender, but after brief exchanges with both Piercy and Cottineau, Captain Landais accepted that his colleague should take the surrender and attend to casualties, while Alliance returned to the main battle. Because the return journey would be against the wind, this would, as Captain Piercy presumably intended, take a while.|$|E

25|$|Mark Albert Fowler is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Mark, an original regular character when the series started in February 1985, became a semi-regular after his original portrayer David Scarboro was written out of the role in April 1985. Scarboro made brief returns to the role in 1986 and 1987. Scarboro died by suicide in April 1988, and the role was recast in 1990, with Todd Carty taking on the role. From this point the character was a permanent fixture in the series and Carty remained in the role until the character was written out of the series in early 2003. Initially a delinquent teenager, he became a changed man when he was 22. His contracting HIV forced him to grow <b>up</b> <b>fast</b> and accept his responsibilities. He frequently {{found it difficult to}} accept the restrictions of the illness, which finally claimed his life in April 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{operations}} of the Pharaoh Thutmose III gives evidence of Egyptian sophistication. At the Battle of Megiddo, in present-day Jordan, Syrian troops deployed {{in front of the}} city. Thutmose first sent the left wing of his force northwest of Megiddo, to cut off the Syrian line of retreat. He redeployed his right wing south of the city, and concentrated his powerful strike force of chariots, over 1,000 of them in the center. The chariots smashed the right flank of the Syrian formation and the Egyptian infantry, coming <b>up</b> <b>fast,</b> waded into the fray with javelin, sword and battle-axe. The Syrians army crumbled. Such successes were to continue as the improved Egyptian forces grew in power and influence throughout the region. The rise of Persia saw the conquest of the Egyptian state and the end of its independent military activity, however Egyptian forces, including the Nubian bowmen, still continued to make their mark as part of the Persian army, and even saw action against Alexander the Great at Issus, circa 333BC.|$|E

At sixteen he was made his first grade debut for Claremont-Cottesloe as a batsman, but after unproductive performances was dropped to the second XI. The following year in 1958–59, he continued in second grade and took <b>up</b> <b>fast</b> bowling, taking 50 wickets {{at an average of}} 14.50 after his team had a pace bowling shortage. He was recalled to the First XI in 1959–60. He finished the season with 515 runs at an average of 39.46 and 49 wickets at an average of 11.21. His efforts were rewarded in when the state selectors handed him a debut for the penultimate match of the Sheffield Shield season against Victoria in Melbourne. He went wicketless and scored 22 and 41. He took his first wickets in the final match against South Australia at Perth with 3/69. At season’s end, his captain Ken Meuleman advised McKenzie to concentrate on his fast bowling.|$|E

500|$|The 1–0 {{loss was}} Australia's first series defeat since the notorious Bodyline series twenty years earlier that had {{motivated}} Lindwall to take <b>up</b> <b>fast</b> bowling. Despite Australia's troubles, Lindwall maintained his high standards, taking 26 wickets {{at an average}} of only 18.84, as well as contributing two fifties for a total of 159 runs at 17.66. For the entire tour, he had taken 85 wickets at 16.40, only one less than in 1948. At 32 years of age, Lindwall still maintained his high pace, but had developed more subtleties and an inswinger. Fingleton, now a journalist said [...] "One wonders once more at Lindwall's amazing capacity to bowl this ball whenever he feels like it".|$|E

McKnight recalled {{that it was a}} [...] "low-key" [...] photoshoot featuring less than 50 people, and was conducted on Madonna's birthday, hence it was wrapped <b>up</b> <b>fast</b> since the singer had to go for her party. The cover was released online, and depicted the singer upside down, looking upward with heavy make-up, a nose ring, blond hair, and simple neon fonts. Inspired by actress Jean Harlow, the singer sported over-plucked eyebrows for the photos which were designed by makeup artist Francois Nars.|$|E

Not yet 20, Connelly has neatly managed the transition from child actress to ingenue". During an interview with Shaeffer, Connelly commented on her first nude scene: [...] "The nudity {{was hard for me}} and something I thought about...but it's not in a sleazy context". The same year, director Garry Marshall considered her for the role of Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman, but ultimately felt that she was too young for the part.|$|E

500|$|... "Breakout" [...] is a pop song lasting {{three minutes}} and twenty-six seconds. Written {{in the key}} of E major, it follows the chord {{progression}} G5—Dsus—Csus2—Dsus, beginning with a fast beat, composed of chiming electric guitar and drums and later progressing to [...] "the snares skip and the keyboards shimmer". In the view of Chris William of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Breakout"'s lyrics are [...] "a harangue against life's cruelest inequities", drawing attention to the opening verse, [...] "Every week's the same/Stuck in school's so lame/My parents say that I'm lazy/Getting up at 8 a.m.'s crazy/Tired of bein' told what to do/So unfair, so uncool," [...] though adding that the song {{was a sign that}} the [...] "little girl isn't growing up". However, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times said the song was indeed about growing <b>up</b> <b>fast,</b> referencing the lines [...] "It feels so good to let go" [...] and [...] "Wish it would never end" [...] and Jodi Rosen of Rolling Stone also believed [...] "she's venting the frustrations of a teen who's too grown-up to submit to her parents, teachers or anyone else" [...] with the lines [...] "tired of bein' told what to do".|$|E
500|$|... "Schoolin' Life" [...] is an uptempo R and funk song, which {{contains}} elements of disco and dance-pop. Built on a 1980s-inspired beat, the song's instrumentation includes old school synthesizers, 1980s-sounding drum kits wailing electric guitars, and horns. Music critics, including Jamie Peck of MTV noted that [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] {{was inspired by}} the prime work of Prince, particularly because of its lyrical content, the instruments used, and Knowles' style of singing on it. Lyrically, the song finds Knowles detailing her experiences as she was growing up. In the first verse, she employs guttural vocals to address many life lessons to [...] "20-somethings", [...] "30-somethings", [...] "40-somethings", and [...] "50-somethings". Knowles warns them against some consequences, affirming [...] "time really moves fast" [...] and that growing <b>up</b> <b>fast</b> will leave them wanting more. Knowles also talks about still excelling in a world where parents try to shield everything, [...] "Mom and dad tried to hide the world / Said the world's just too big for a little girl / Eyes wide open can't you see / I had my first heels by the age of 13".|$|E

[...] The tongue-in-cheek word [...] "Yeah!" [...] is repeated after each verse. Another lyric, [...] "It's a new art form showing people how little we care" [...] is described as [...] "perfectly damning the wave of banal hedonism most recently celebrated by the MTV Video Music Awards", according to Kevin Liedel from Slant Magazine. At the bridge, Lorde sings [...] "I fall apart, with all my heart/ And you can watch from your window", which was described as a [...] "perfect" [...] commentary on the breakdowns of teenage celebrities in an article published by The Huffington Post.|$|E

500|$|White {{was willing}} to print a variety of fiction, with {{traditional}} stories side-by-side with more experimental material that {{was influenced by the}} British New Wave or by 1960s psychedelia. In 1971 he serialized Ursula K. Le Guin's The Lathe of Heaven, about a man whose dreams can modify reality. One writer who was influenced by this was James Tiptree, Jr., who later wrote that [...] "after first plowing into the first pulpy pages of the 1971 Amazing in which Lathe came out, my toe-nails began to curl under and my spine hair stood up." [...] White's willingness to experiment led to Amazing running more stories with sexual content than other magazines. One such story, White's own [...] "Growing <b>Up</b> <b>Fast</b> in the City", was criticized as pornographic by some of Amazings readers. Other stories, such as Rich Brown's [...] "Two of a Kind", about the violent rape of a black woman and the subsequent death of her rapists, also led to controversy. White also printed more conventional fiction, however, much of it of high quality. The magazine was nominated for the Hugo award (a readers' award, named for Hugo Gernsback) for best editor three times during his tenure (1970, 1971 and 1972), finishing third each time.|$|E
