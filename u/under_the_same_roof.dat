5000|$|However, the {{introduction}} of eight years of compulsory education in 1997 has seen a sudden decline in the popularity of Imam Hatip schools. In 1999, the reclassification of Imam Hatip schools as [...] "vocationalschools" [...] meant that, although more options had been made available to graduates, attaining places at prestigious university courses became more difficult. By requiring that all eight compulsory years of schooling be spent <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> primary-school <b>roof,</b> middle schools were abolished. Children could not enter vocational schools (one of them the Imam Hatip school) until the ninth grade (rather than the sixth, as before).|$|R

Light from glazed rifts in the roofing above comes into the nave from the south and north gables, with a similar approach in the church hall. The entire complex is built of red brick, with zig-zag patterns in the gable brickwork, and is roofed with copper. The free-standing bell tower stands to the southwest.|$|R

50|$|The {{value of}} an {{integrated}} spiritual community was obvious to {{the author of the}} Liber Graduum. His dream to house the deepest ascetics and newborns in <b>the</b> faith <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> congregational <b>roof</b> was a powerful one. As a pastor of the community, he could never come alongside every single member and nudge them towards righteousness in God; just as with all things in Syriac Christianity of that time, {{it had to be a}} communal effort. Building a tightly knit spiritual group of people that depended on each other led to mentorship among those on the “steps” that could not have happened in more individualistic settings. With the author’s dream realized, all members could potentially teach and be taught by other members of the group, forming and equipping skills necessary for the Christian life for that time. This was a beautiful dream, and a fascinating reality.|$|R

60|$|We {{asked for}} Burns's dwelling; {{and a woman}} pointed {{across the street to}} a two-story house, built of stone, and whitewashed, like its neighbors, but perhaps of a little more respectable aspect than most of them, though I {{hesitate}} in saying so. It was not a separate structure, but <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> continuous <b>roof</b> with <b>the</b> next. There was an inscription on the door, hearing no reference to Burns, but indicating that the house was now occupied by a ragged or industrial school. On knocking, we were instantly admitted by a servant-girl, who smiled intelligently when we told our errand, and showed us into a low and very plain parlor, not more than twelve or fifteen feet square. A young woman, who seemed to be a teacher in the school, soon appeared, and told us that this had been Burns's usual sitting-room, and that he had written many of his songs here.|$|R

We, the five Iroquois Nations, compose but one cabin; we maintain but one fire; and we have, from time immemorial, dwelt <b>under</b> one and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof.</b> Well, then, will you not enter the cabin by the door, which is at the ground floor of the house?

That man was my ancestor in the eighth degree, old yeoman Caresfoot, and the occasion of his speech was to him a very important one, being the day on which he planted Caresfoot's Staff, the great oak by the water yonder, to mark the founding of a house of country gentry. Some centuries have elapsed since my forefather stood where I stand, most like with his hand upon this board as mine is now, and addressed a company not so fine or so well dressed, but perhaps--I mean no disrespect--on the whole, as good at heart as that before me now. Yes, the sapling oak has grown into the biggest tree in the country-side 'twixt then and now.

Towards {{the end of the}} colonial era, more African elements were incorporated into Christianity, including songs and dances which were formerly condemned as pagan. Eventually, even native fables and myths were appropriated and merged into Congolese Christianity, in a similar process to that which occurred with Christianity in Europe.|$|E

Among her tutors during her youth was her mother's sister, María Dolores Molina, who was the mother of her first cousin and future husband Manuel Luis Quezón. After her father's imprisonment, she was taken in by her aunt María Dolores and uncle Lucio, and she lived for a time <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof</b> as her future spouse.

25|$|The 1895 {{consolidation}} {{marked the}} end of the Astor Library.

It had been conceived in the mind of Joseph Cogswell, a scholar and book lover, and its growth and development followed closely the policies he had planned and prepared.

30|$|Beyond  objective  and  subjective  career  success In {{addition}} to {{drawing attention to}} these requirements, SCrT may also bring together subjective and objective career success in a useful way. As we noted above, they are empirically only moderately correlated, and indeed {{there has been much}} discussion on the theoretical connections between the two (e.g. Nicholson and De Waal-Andrews 2005; Arthur et  al. 2005) and why the correlations may not be as high as a naive view (if  I  have done well in life, why should  I  not be happy?) might suggest (e.g. Hall and Chandler 2005). Despite this, the two constructs are typically discussed as though they are quite distinct (Judge and Kammeyer-Mueller 2007; Ng et  al. 2005). SCrT, however, makes no distinction between the two: condition is, in principle, everything we can say about an individual, so it encompasses both subjective and objective descriptors. Happiness, wealth, career satisfaction, and status in its many manifestations are all aspects of condition. Let us imagine examining the objective career success of a particular person in increasing detail, that is, bringing more and more aspects of objective condition into the picture. Inevitably we shall get drawn into a view of the career that includes subjective elements. For example, the more one learns about the sequence of roles someone occupies (objective), the more one is drawn into examining the intentions of the career actor (subjective). Conversely, the more we examine the way someone's sense of self-worth or satisfaction changes over time, the more we are forced to ask: what objectively was going on at the time to explain these changes? So SCrT, by failing to differentiate in principle between the objective and subjective – in other words, by including both kinds of condition <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> conceptual <b>roof</b> – provides a framework for regarding the objective as context for the subjective and vice versa, an example of what Luhman calls mutual provision of meaning (in a similar way as interpenetration, Luhmann's theoretical figure related to the mutual provision of complexity of social systems; see Luhmann 1995, pp.   210   ff.).|$|R

25|$|On Berlioz's {{return to}} Paris, a concert {{including}} Symphonie fantastique (which had been extensively revised in Italy) and Le retour à la vie was performed, with Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, Heinrich Heine, Niccolò Paganini, Franz Liszt, Frédéric Chopin, George Sand, Alfred de Vigny, Théophile Gautier, Jules Janin, Harriet Smithson {{and others in}} the audience. At this time, Berlioz also met playwright Ernest Legouvé who became a lifelong friend. A few days after the performance, Berlioz and Harriet were finally introduced and entered into a relationship. Despite Berlioz not understanding spoken English and Harriet not knowing any French, on 3 October 1833, they got married in a civil ceremony at the British Embassy with Liszt as one of the witnesses. The following year their only child, Louis Berlioz, was born– a source of initial disappointment, anxiety and eventual pride to his father. Unfortunately for Berlioz, he was soon to discover that living <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof</b> as his beloved wife was far less appealing than worship from afar. Their marriage turned out a disaster as both were prone to violent personality clashes and outbursts of temper.|$|E
