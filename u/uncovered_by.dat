5|$|About 20 large (40–150m across) ejecta blocks {{have been}} identified, {{embedded}} in Ida's regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest {{pieces of the}} regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or <b>uncovered</b> <b>by</b> an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, {{but they may not}} have been produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater Azzurra {{on the opposite side of}} the asteroid.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the plan, Ivan and his cavalry approached Constantinople while Michael Shishman waited in Yambol with his army.

While Ivan stuck to the plan and signed an oath that he had come with peace to persuade the Byzantines, he promptly retreated to Bulgarian territory upon receiving that order from Michael Shishman.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one piece of evidence <b>uncovered</b> <b>by</b> the Inquiry during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise the morning after the crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 1985, Congressman James H. Weaver gave {{a speech}} in the United States House of Representatives in which he {{asserted}} that the Rajneeshees {{were involved in the}} bioterror attack in Oregon. At a series of press conferences in September 1985, Rajneesh accused several of his recently departed lieutenants of involvement in this and other crimes, including the poisoning of Mike Sullivan, a Jefferson County district attorney, and asked state and federal authorities to investigate his allegations. The assassination plot was <b>uncovered</b> <b>by</b> federal law enforcement {{as a result of the}} ensuing investigation into activities at Rajneeshpuram.

5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is <b>uncovered</b> <b>by</b> examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage {{in some form of}} social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed {{over a period of time}} using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E
5|$|Stela 29 bears a Long Count (8.12.14.8.15) date {{equivalent}} to AD 292, the earliest surviving Long Count {{date from the}} Maya lowlands. The stela is also the earliest monument to bear the Tikal emblem glyph. It bears a sculpture of the king facing to the right, holding {{the head of an}} underworld jaguar god, one of the patron deities of the city. The stela was deliberately smashed during the 6th century or some time later, the upper portion was dragged away and dumped in a rubbish tip close to Temple III, to be <b>uncovered</b> <b>by</b> archaeologists in 1959.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} his cover identity, Pilecki lived under various assumed names and changed jobs frequently.

Nevertheless, Pilecki was informed in July 1946 that his actual identity had been <b>uncovered</b> <b>by</b> the MBP. He was ordered to leave the country; but he declined. In April 1947, he began independently collecting evidence of Soviet atrocities committed in Poland during the 1939–1941 occupation as well {{as evidence of the}} unlawful arrest and prosecution of Home Army veterans and ex-members of the Polish Armed Forces in the West, which often resulted in execution or imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|After a short return, Georgia QB Stafford {{went to work}} on the Georgia 24-yard line. Two {{incomplete}} {{passes and}} one sack later, Georgia was again punting. Virginia Tech again was in excellent field position, starting on their own 47-yard line. Instead of rushing the ball, as had been the trend for the Tech offense up to that point, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer called for a trick play. At the snap, quarterback Sean Glennon lateraled the football to wide receiver Eddie Royal. Rather than running the ball, Royal threw the ball downfield, catching the Georgia defense off guard. Tight end Sam Wheeler, the target of the throw, had been left <b>uncovered</b> <b>by</b> a defense expecting a run. The pass was completed, and Wheeler ran unimpeded 53yards for a touchdown. The play took 19seconds to execute, and gave Virginia Tech a 21–3 lead with 4:00 remaining in the half.|$|E
5|$|An inscribed block {{dating to}} the later Ramesside period (1292–1077 BC) and now in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, was <b>uncovered</b> <b>by</b> Lepsius {{in a house in}} Abusir and shows Menkauhor enthroned beside four other deified kings of the Old Kingdom: the name of the first, {{partially}} lost, but probably Sneferu is then followed by Djedefre, Menkaure, Menkauhor and finally Neferkare. The owner of the tomb stands before the kings, in worship. Another relief {{dating to the}} same period shows a similar scene. It was inscribed on the lintel of the tomb chapel of Mahy buried in Saqqara North. Four deified kings of the Old Kingdom are shown, all of whom built their pyramids at Saqqara: Djoser, Teti, Userkaf and Menkauhor.|$|E
5|$|Jogaila {{had sent}} Klemens Moskarzewski to {{establish}} a Polish garrison in Vilnius and stabilize the situation, but this move only angered the opposition. In May 1389 Jogaila tried to mediate the conflict between Skirgaila and Vytautas in Lublin. Vytautas was pressured into signing a formal document declaring that he was loyal to Skirgaila and supported him, but his position as Duke of Lutsk was not formally acknowledged. Vytautas secured his position in Lutsk, and turned his sights on Vilnius. According to Teutonic testimony at the Council of Constance, Vytautas planned {{to take advantage of}} his sister's wedding by sending wagons filled with meat, hay, and other goods to Vilnius. The wagons would be escorted by armed men, who would capture the castle once inside the city. This plan was <b>uncovered</b> <b>by</b> a German spy and the conspirators were executed. In another setback, two of Vytautas' strongest allies, his brother Tautvilas and his brother-in-law Ivan Olshanski, lost their territories in Navahrudak and Halshany.|$|E

5|$|Map-making in China {{preceded the}} Han dynasty. Since two 4th-century-BCE silk maps from the State of Qin (found in Gansu, {{displaying}} the region about the Jialing River) show the measured distance between timber-gathering sites, Mei-ling Hsu argues {{that these are}} to be considered the first known economic maps (as they predate the maps of the Roman geographer Strabo, c. 64 BCE– 24 CE). Maps from the Han period have also been <b>uncovered</b> <b>by</b> modern archaeologists, such as those found with 2nd-century-BCE silk texts at Mawangdui. In contrast to the Qin maps, the Han maps found at Mawangdui employ a more diverse use of map symbols, cover a larger terrain, and display information on local populations and even pinpoint locations of military camps. One of the maps discovered at Mawangdui shows positions of Han military garrisons which were to attack Nanyue in 181 BCE.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} historian Jeremy Black {{points out}} that From Russia, with Love was written and published {{at a time when}} tensions between East and West were on the rise and public awareness of the Cold War was high. A joint British and American operation to tap into landline communication of the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the Soviet-occupied zone had been publicly <b>uncovered</b> <b>by</b> the Soviets in April 1956. The same month the diver Lionel Crabb had gone missing on a mission to photograph the propeller of the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze while the ship was moored in Portsmouth Harbour, an incident that was much reported and discussed in British newspapers.
