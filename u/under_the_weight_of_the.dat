5|$|Mannerheim {{decided to}} strike first at Tampere. He {{launched}} {{the attack on}} 16 March at Längelmäki, 65km north-east of the town. At the same time, the White Army began advancing along a northern and north-western frontline, through Vilppula–Kuru–Kyröskoski–Suodenniemi. Many Red Guard units collapsed and retreated in panic <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assault, while some detachments defended their posts relentlessly, {{and were able to}} slow the advance of the White Guards, who were unaccustomed to offensive warfare. Eventually, the Whites lay siege to Tampere. They cut off the Reds southward connection in Lempäälä on 24 March and westward in Siuro (Nokia, Finland) and Ylöjärvi on 25 March.|$|E
5|$|Bishop John Harewell {{raised money}} for the {{completion}} of the west front by William Wynford, who was appointed as master mason in 1365. One of the foremost architects of his time, Wynford worked for the king at Windsor, Winchester Cathedral and New College, Oxford. At Wells, he designed the western towers of which north-west was not built until the following century. In the 14th century, the central piers of the crossing were found to be sinking <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crossing tower which had been damaged by an earthquake in the previous century. Strainer arches, sometimes described as scissor arches, were inserted by master mason William Joy to brace and stabilise the piers as a unit.|$|E
5|$|Despite safety measures, {{incidents}} {{may happen}} during the Hajj as pilgrims are trampled or ramps collapse <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many visitors. During 2015 Hajj, a stampede resulted in 769 deaths and injuries to 934 others, {{according to the}} Saudi authorities. A report from Associated Press totalled at least 1470 fatalities from official reports from other countries, making it the most deadly such episode to date. Concerns were raised in 2013 and 2014 about the spread of MERS because of mass gatherings during the Hajj. Saudi Health Minister Abdullah Al-Rabia said authorities have detected no cases of MERS among the pilgrims so far. He also said that, despite few cases of MERS, Saudi Arabia {{was ready for the}} 2014 pilgrimage.|$|E

5|$|Tolkien {{argues that}} the {{original}} poem has almost been lost <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scholarship on it; that Beowulf {{must be seen as}} a poem, not just as a historical document; and that the quality of its verse and its structure give it a powerful effect. He rebuts suggestions that the poem is an epic or exciting narrative, likening it instead to a strong masonry structure built of blocks that fit together. He points out that the poem's theme is a serious one, mortality, and that the poem is in two parts: the first on Beowulf as a young man, defeating Grendel and his mother; the second on Beowulf in old age, going to his death fighting the dragon.|$|E

25|$|The track {{guides the}} conical, flanged wheels, keeping the {{cars on the}} track without active {{steering}} and therefore allowing trains to be much longer than road vehicles. The rails and ties are usually placed on a foundation made of compressed earth on top of which is placed a bed of ballast to distribute the load from the ties and to prevent the track from buckling as the ground settles over time <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicles passing above.|$|E
25|$|The {{area from}} Long Island to Nantucket, Massachusetts was formed from glacial till, and {{the plethora of}} lakes on the Canadian Shield in {{northern}} Canada can be almost entirely attributed to {{the action of the}} ice. As the ice retreated and the rock dust dried, winds carried the material hundreds of miles, forming beds of loess many dozens of feet thick in the Missouri Valley. Post-glacial rebound continues to reshape the Great Lakes and other areas formerly <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice sheets.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} winter {{navigation}} in Finland {{dates back to}} the 17th century when mail was carried year-round between Turku, Finland and Grisslehamn, Sweden, over the Sea of Åland. During the winter season, the postmen used ice boats, strengthened sleigh-boats that were pushed over the ice until it gave in <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boat. Once in water, the men began rocking the boat back and forth until it slowly began to break the ice and proceed towards open water. The mail route was often called the most dangerous in Europe.|$|E

25|$|A bomb bay was {{incorporated}} in the fuselage {{in front of the}} pilot, with four doors which could be opened by the bombardier or would open <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dropped bombs. As specified in 23/25, a single 520lb bomb could be carried, or a number of smaller weapons. The presence of a bomb bay in the fuselage required a complicated split-axle arrangement for the fixed undercarriage, which was braced to the fuselage and the wing struts. A cross-axle would have been in path of the falling bombs.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{magnitude}} 8.0 earthquake in Sichuan province of China on 12 May 2008, many rivers became blocked by landslides, resulting in the formation of so-called quake lakes: large amounts of water pooling up behind the landslide-formed dams. These dams eventually broke <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, endangering those downstream. At least one Mi-26 belonging to a branch of China's civil aviation service was used to bring heavy earth moving tractors to the quake-lakes at Tangjiashan mountain, located in difficult terrain and accessible only by foot or air.|$|E
25|$|The Rouse profile characterizes {{sediment}} concentrations {{because the}} Rouse number includes both turbulent mixing and settling <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particles. Turbulent mixing {{results in the}} net motion of particles from regions of high concentrations to low concentrations. Because particles settle downward, for all cases where the particles are not neutrally buoyant or sufficiently light that this settling velocity is negligible, there is a net negative concentration gradient as one goes upward in the flow. The Rouse Profile therefore gives the concentration profile that provides a balance between turbulent mixing (net upwards) of sediment and the downwards settling velocity of each particle.|$|E

25|$|The {{round bow}} of Murtaja was modeled after Eisbrecher I, a German {{icebreaker}} designed by engineer Ferdinand Steinhaus from Hamburg and built in 1871, even though Robert Runeberg, an experienced Finnish naval architect {{and son of}} the national poet of Finland, had recommended a sharper ice-cutting bow instead of the spoon-shaped one. The angle of the stem, {{the first part of}} the icebreaker to encounter ice and bend it <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship, was 33 degrees. The hull was extremely strong for its size and the shell plating thickness at the ice belt, , was twice as thick as in the strongest winter ships at that time.|$|E
25|$|On July 16, Dupont and Vedel, {{expecting a}} desperate {{struggle}} for Andújar, found Castaños and Coupigny merely repeating the previous day's noisy demonstrations without seriously attempting a passage. Reding, however, {{was on the}} move: making a feint toward the Mengibar ferry with his sharpshooters, the Swiss forded the river upstream at Rincon and, encircling Mengibar, crushed the French battalions under Ligier-Belair. General Gobert, rushing forth from Bailén to plug the gap, {{was shot in the}} head and later died of the wound, and his counterattack, carried on by Brigadier-General Dufour, collapsed <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spaniards. Distracting Reding with repeated charges from his cuirassiers, Dufour disengaged his men and fell back onto Bailén.|$|E
25|$|From {{the archaeological}} {{excavations}} in the 1970s, {{it is clear}} that construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure and that the Triportico and Rotunda roughly overlapped with the temple building itself; the excavations indicate that the temple extended at least {{as far back as the}} Aedicule, and the temple enclosure would have reached back slightly further. Virgilio Canio Corbo, a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, who was present at the excavations, estimated from the archaeological evidence that the western retaining wall, of the temple itself, would have passed extremely close to the east side of the supposed tomb; if the wall had been any further west any tomb would have been crushed <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall (which would be immediately above it) if it had not already been destroyed when foundations for the wall were made.|$|E
