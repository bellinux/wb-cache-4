40|$|We examine {{factors that}} might explain how {{sanctions}} imposed in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) enforcement actions vary across the firms and countries implicated using a dataset of FCPA actions resolved from 2004 to 2011. We find evidence that the sanctions in an individual FCPA action are positively correlated with the egregiousness and extensiveness of the bribe. The sanctions also increase if the <b>ultimate</b> <b>parent</b> company of <b>entities</b> involved in the FCPA violation is foreign and if foreign regulators {{are involved in the}} action. At the country level we report evidence that the SEC and DOJ impose greater aggregate sanctions for violations in countries with a lower GNI per capita and weaker local anti-bribery institutions. The SEC and DOJ also impose disproportionately greater aggregate sanctions for violations where the home country of the <b>ultimate</b> <b>parent</b> company of FCPA defendants has a greater GNI per capita, stronger anti-bribery institutions, and a cooperation agreement with U. S. regulators. Overall, these findings suggest that factors besides those deemed relevant by U. S. and international law influence enforcement of the FCPA...|$|R

40|$|Executive Summary: This {{research}} {{addresses the}} issue {{of the extent to which}} <b>parent</b> <b>entity</b> financial information is needed by users of general purpose financial reports (GPFRs). It provides objective evidence aimed at assisting the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) to determine whether it should recommend legislative changes in respect of the form, content and presentation of <b>parent</b> <b>entity</b> information. The broad research problem investigated in this paper is: For Australian entities that provide consolidated GPFRs, what form, content and presentation of separate <b>parent</b> <b>entity</b> financial information is needed by GPFR users? To address this issue, survey data were collected via both an internet questionnaire and personal interviews. The sample comprises users of GPFRs from across a diverse range of financial report user groups. The results indicate that many financial report users, predominantly those working in roles involving credit risk assessment, use information from the <b>parent</b> <b>entity</b> financial reports. However, the frequency of use and particular components of the financial reports used varies across financial report user groups. There is no particular sub-set of information that would satisfy the <b>parent</b> <b>entity</b> information needs of all GPFR users. Therefore, there is limited potential to reduce <b>parent</b> <b>entity</b> reporting requirements to less than a full set of financial reports (financial statements and notes). However, an examination of financial report users’ needs for <b>parent</b> <b>entity</b> financial reports to be audited, lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and published in the annual report, as well as their information needs in relation to particular types of <b>parent</b> <b>entities,</b> reveals some potential for a reduction in reporting requirements. In particular, the reductions in <b>parent</b> <b>entity</b> reporting requirements that could be achieved without compromising the information needs of GPFR users include: o	removal of the requirement for <b>parent</b> <b>entity</b> financial reports to be published in the annual report; and o	exemptions from the requirement to lodge audited general purpose <b>parent</b> <b>entity</b> financial reports with ASIC for <b>parent</b> <b>entities</b> that: (a) 	do not conduct substantive operations, including treasury operations; (b) 	are not borrowing entities; (c) 	are not single guarantors for the debt of one or more subsidiaries. Further, the research results indicate that a reduction in <b>parent</b> <b>entity</b> reporting requirements would need to be supplemented by additional disclosures in the annual report. These disclosures would provide details of: o whether audited <b>parent</b> <b>entity</b> reports have been lodged with ASIC and, if not, a statement indicating that each of the exception criteria outlined above are satisfied; o	<b>parent</b> <b>entity</b> shareholders’ funds, including dividends and franking credits, if different from the consolidated amounts; o	how the group is structured, including which entities within the group conduct the major trading and treasury operations; o	in which entities the group’s borrowings and contingent liabilities reside; o	class orders, guarantees and indemnities in place, including which entities are party to the guarantee(s). ...|$|R
