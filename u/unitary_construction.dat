25|$|The Triumph Spitfire was {{originally}} devised by Standard-Triumph {{to compete in the}} small sports car market that had opened up with the introduction of the Austin-Healey Sprite. The Sprite had used the basic drive train of the Austin A30/A35 in a light body to make up a budget sports car; Triumph's idea was to use the mechanicals from their small saloon, the Herald, to underpin the new project, this made the vehicle a classic Parts bin special. Triumph had one advantage, however; where the Austin A30 range was of <b>unitary</b> <b>construction,</b> the Herald featured a separate chassis. It was Triumph's intention to cut that chassis down and clothe it in a sports body, saving the costs of developing a completely new chassis/body unit.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} the Trabants left the VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau factory in Saxony on 7 November 1957. It was a {{relatively}} advanced car when it was formally introduced the following year, with front wheel drive, <b>unitary</b> <b>construction</b> and independent suspension. The Trabant's greatest shortcoming was its engine. By the late 1950s many small Western cars (such as the Renault) had cleaner, more-efficient four-stroke engines, but budgetary constraints and raw-materials shortages mandated an outdated (but inexpensive) two-stroke engine in the Trabant. It was technically equivalent to the West German Lloyd automobile, a similarly sized car with an air-cooled, two-cylinder four-stroke engine. The Trabant had a front, transversely-mounted engine and front-wheel drive {{in an era when}} many European cars were using rear-mounted engines or front-mounted engines with rear-wheel drive. Its greatest drawback was its largely unchanged production; the car's two-stroke engine made it obsolete by the 1970s, limiting exports to Western Europe.|$|E

Some of these have reproduced old, unitary notions of racialized hierarchy, while others have helped to disrupt racism.
