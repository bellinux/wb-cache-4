5|$|Congestion pricing or {{congestion}} charges is {{a system}} of surcharging users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage congestion without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the congestion pricing concept, postulates that <b>users</b> <b>will</b> be forced to pay for the negative externalities they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the environment.|$|E

50|$|If an {{interface}} is used persistently, the <b>user</b> <b>will</b> unavoidably develop habits {{for using}} the interface. The designer's role can thus be characterized as ensuring the user forms good habits.

An unconcerned <b>user</b> <b>will</b> have few restrictions while a fundamentalist <b>user</b> <b>will</b> have many restrictions.|$|R
25|$|The global {{license is}} a {{realistic}} measure {{in the long}} run. Internet <b>users</b> <b>will</b> use peer-to-peer networks anyway and there are already millions of peer-to-peer users so it’s unreasonable to claim {{that they will be}} prosecuted. Instead of trying to revert this trend {{it would be better to}} tax it.|$|E
