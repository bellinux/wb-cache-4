5|$|Because of the {{long-term}} effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list <b>unadjusted</b> for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The <b>unadjusted</b> list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern <b>unadjusted</b> list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.|$|E

25|$|According to {{systematic}} review, {{in heart}} failure with preserved ejection fraction, treatment with spironolactone {{did not improve}} patient outcomes. This {{is based on the}} TOPCAT Trial examining this issue, which found that of those treated with placebo had a 20.4% incidence of negative outcome vs 18.6% incidence of negative outcome with spironolactone. However, because the p-value of the study was 0.14, and the <b>unadjusted</b> hazard ratio was 0.89 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.77 to 1.04, it is determined the finding had no statistical significance. Hence the finding that patient outcomes are not improved with use of spironolactone. More recently, when blood samples from 366 patients in the TOPCAT study were analyzed for presence of canrenone (an active metabolite of spironolactone), 30% of blood samples from Russia lacked detectable residues of canrenone. This led {{to the conclusion that the}} TOPCAT trial results in Russia don't reflect actual clinical experience with spironolactone in patients with preserved ejection fraction. The TOPCAT study results are now considered to have been invalidated. The study's prime investigator and other prominent research cardiologists are now advising physicians treating heart failure with preserved ejection fraction to consider prescribing spironolactone pending outcome of two multicenter trials of newer medications.|$|E

As with all of the previous films in the franchise, Half-Blood Prince proved to be extremely successful globally with an estimated non-US total gross of $632.5 million, totalling approximately $934.4 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 2009, behind Avatar, and the 34th-highest-grossing film of all time, <b>unadjusted</b> for inflation.

500|$|The {{measuring}} system for gauging a film's success {{is based on}} <b>unadjusted</b> grosses, mainly because historically {{this is the way}} it has always been done because of the practices of the film industry: the box office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media. Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals.
