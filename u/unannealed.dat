Microscopic examination revealed an array of TiO 2 particles, rather than a continuous film. The physical properties of the TiO 2 were examined {{as a function of}} annealing temperature. <b>Unannealed</b> films were found to be amorphous and microporous while those annealed for lh at 500 ~ were fully densified and crystallized. The photocatalytic reduction of Pd, from an aqueous PdC 12 solution, at the TiO 2 surface was studied as a function of annealing temperature. The metal deposition rate was determined to be higher for annealed films and TEM showed fewer nucleation sites with much larger sized deposits than those obtained with <b>unannealed</b> films.

40|$|Quartz {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} natural minerals in the crust of the earth. Due to its dosimetric luminescence properties, it is employed in retrospective dosimetry, archaeological and geological dating. The intensity and the structure of the TL glow curves of quartz are strongly dependent upon the origin, impurity content, formation condition and pre-irradiation heat treatment. The aim of this project is to study the mechanisms of thermoluminescence (TL), Phototranssferred thermoluminescence (PTTL) and radioluminescence (RL) in synthetic quartz and to discuss the results in terms of physical characteristics of point defects involved. Thermoluminescence measurements were made on a sample of synthetic quartz in its as-received state (<b>unannealed)</b> synthetic quartz annealed at 500 ˚C for 10 minutes. The <b>unannealed</b> sample shows six TL glow peaks located at 94, 116, 176, 212, 280 and 348 ˚C at a heating rate of 5 ˚Cs⁻¹. The annealed sample shows seven TL peaks at 115, 148, 214, 246, 300, 348 and 412 ˚C at a heating rate of 5 ˚Cs⁻¹. The intensity of peak I, at 94 and 115 ˚C for the <b>unannealed</b> and annealed samples respectively, increases with irradiation. Peak I has an activation energy of approximately 0. 90 eV and a frequency factor of the order of 10 ¹¹ s⁻¹. The order of kinetics is between 0. 9 and 1. 2. The <b>unannealed</b> synthetic quartz shows phototransferred thermoluminescence (PTTL) at the position of peak I after removal of the first three peaks followed by illumination. The PTTL intensities show peak shaped behaviour when plotted against illumination time. The PTTL showed a quadratic increase with dose. The material exhibits fading of PTTL intensity with delay time. Radioluminescence was measured on synthetic quartz <b>unannealed</b> and annealed annealed at 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000 ˚C for 10 to 60 min. The emission spectra of synthetic quartz show seven emission bands. The effect of irradiation on the RL spectra is to increase the intensity of all emission bands for samples annealed at temperatures less than or equal to 700 ˚C. The effect of annealing time is to increase the RL amplitude for the samples annealed at temperatures greater than 700 ˚C. The annealing temperature increases the RL amplitude of all emission bands of the spectrum for all samples...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of thiolate monolayers in electrochemical sensing systems involving redox amplification and {{the determination of}} nitric oxide has been examined. 10 -mercaptosulfonate monolayers were formed at gold electrodes and characterized by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical reductive desorption (ERD). When dopamine was oxidized at the monolayer-coated electrode with ascorbic acid in solution, an amplification effect was noticed whose magnitude increased with ascorbic acid concentration. These sulfonate monolayer-coated electrodes showed potential in the selective determination of nitric oxide (NO) {{in the presence of}} an anionic interfering species. Also, other monolayer systems involving porphyrin moieties were investigated for electro-catalytic activity for the determination of NO.;Electrochemical and spectroscopic methods were utilized to elucidate thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena that take place during thiol adsorption at gold electrodes. ERD was used to determine the rates of film formation at annealed and <b>unannealed</b> electrode surfaces. When micromolar concentrations of thiol precursors were employed, full coverage was only obtained after an hour of immersion time. When data from annealed and <b>unannealed</b> surfaces were evaluated, a faster rate of formation was found for the <b>unannealed</b> surface, and the interrogation of processes at step and terrace sites of the <b>unannealed</b> surface revealed faster initial rates of adsorption at the step sites. Using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm as a first approximation, a DeltaG ads of - 9. 0 kcal mol- 1 was calculated. Other ERD experiments demonstrated that butanethiolate monolayers show fine structure in their current-potential curves that can be attributed to heterogeneity in terrace width. Results from thin-layer visible spectroscopy showed a measurable pH change upon the adsorption of propanethiol from an aqueous solution containing chlorophenol red.

30|$|We {{can observe}} that {{the curve of}} the <b>unannealed</b> Cu 2 O film is smooth, whereas the curves {{corresponding}} to annealed films exhibit interference fringes. The annealed Cu 2 O films are transparent in the visible region and exhibit sharp absorption edges that {{can be attributed to the}} good crystallinity and low defect concentration in the film. Whereas an <b>unannealed</b> film doesn’t shows sharp absorption edge due to the low crystallinity level and high defect density near the band edge. Also by annealing, the film’s transparency is increased and the optical properties of films improved due to the increase of crystallinity and decrease the defect density at the edge of energy band gap. The transmittance of the annealed film at 450  °C is lower than the annealed film’s at 250  °C. These results are due to the transformation of Cu 2 O to CuO as it was evidenced by the XRD results.|$|E

However, this inflection is doubtful for 14  µm and larger magnetites and is completely absent from the corresponding <b>unannealed</b> magnetite warming curves. It is also absent from the cooling or warming curves of 300  K saturation remanence for the 1, 6 and 9  µm samples (Fig.  2).

Raman spectroscopy {{was performed on}} both <b>unannealed</b> and annealed samples, at temperatures of 350 and 250 °C for 10 min. From the spectra, {{we can see that}} the intensity of the LO modes becomes weaker after Ga+ irradiation. Figure 4 b- 1 shows the <b>unannealed</b> sample, where the LO mode red shifts to ~ 220 cm- 1 and its intensity almost approaches zero. This means that the GaSb nanofibers become amorphous by Ga+ ion irradiation. Figure 4 b- 2 and 4 b- 3 present the spectra for the annealed samples, in which the LO mode red shifts to ~ 225 cm- 1 and the full widths at half maximum (FWHM) were broadened in comparison with bulk GaSb spectrum. The stronger intensity of the LO modes means the amorphous nanofibers became crystalline through the annealing process. Such behavior of the Raman peak red shift and broadening {{can be explained by the}} phonon confinement effect [23]. Figure 4 c presents the Raman peaks of GaSb nanofibers irradiated by 150 keV Kr+ ions, both <b>unannealed</b> and annealed at the temperature of 250 °C. From the spectra, we cannot find the mode of GaSb from the two curves. These alterations of the LO mode by ion implantation on the crystalline structure are also attributed to the disordering of the crystalline structure. Because the decay of translational symmetry relaxes the momentum conservation, all photons in the Brillouin zone participate in ordered Raman scattering. These will generally induce the shift of the LO mode to a lower energy and cause asymmetric broadening [24].|$|E

The surface-confined Au nanoclusters were observed only on the shorter chain SAMs (C 8 SH to C 16 SH) and not on C 18 SH SAMs. This is attributed to the longer chain length of C 18 SH preventing the insertion of pincer molecules. Microcontact printing (µCP) with C 18 SH on <b>unannealed</b> gold substrates and the subsequent immersion of the substrates into C 8 SH, C 10 SH, C 12 SH, or C 16 SH solutions, yielded a series of patterned SAMs that have areas of thiols of different chain lengths.

Whereas silver nanoparticles deposit preferentially on the +z domains on <b>unannealed</b> crystals, the deposition occurs preferentially along 180 ° domain walls for annealed crystals. In neither case is the deposition selective; limited deposition occurs also on the <b>unannealed</b> –z domain surface and on both annealed domain surfaces.

Three similar InGaAsP samples were examined {{one of which was}} annealed at 800 °C for 1 s, one was annealed at 700 °C for 1 s and the other was not annealed after crystal growth by molecular beam epitaxy. Although the carrier lifetimes of the 700 °C-annealed sample and the <b>unannealed</b> sample were similar, that of the 800 °C-annealed sample was extended to 11. 6 (10. 4) ns at 10 (300) K, which was more than two (four) times those of the other samples. However, interestingly the spin relaxation time of the 800 °C-annealed sample was found to be {{similar to those of the}} other two samples. Particularly at room temperature, the spin relaxation times are 143 ps, 147 ps, and 111 ps for the 800 °C-annealed sample, 700 °C-annealed sample, and the <b>unannealed</b> sample, respectively...|$|E
40|$|High current beams {{suitable}} for USJ implantation were generated by 'Chicane Deceleration' involving an s-bend to block contaminants. Implanted wafers were analyzed with 200 eV O 2 + beams at 45 ° {{to resolve the}} sources of dopant profile variation in fine detail. Energy contamination is essentially eliminated, but for B+ channeling remains important. <b>Unannealed</b> Xj values from 5 to 7 nm are reported for different implant species. © 2006 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
