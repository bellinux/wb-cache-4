The lantern surmounting the dome, also designed by Brunelleschi, was not begun until 1446, after his death. It was completed by Michelozzo di Bartolommeo and Bernardo Rossellino in 1467. Brunelleschi had also planned for a two-story external gallery and cornice to be built at the top of the drum where a strip of <b>unclad</b> masonry can be seen today.

40|$|An {{evanescent}} fibre sensor for {{detection of}} methane was fabricated by {{the inclusion of}} two types of cryptophane molecules in a transparent polymeric cladding (polysiloxane), deposited on a PCS fibre. Synthesis of crytophanes A and E are described {{as well as the}} preparation of the specific polymeric cladding, its deposition on the <b>uncladded</b> part of the optical fibre, the optimal thickness being 5 mu m and the optimal length of <b>uncladded</b> part being 5 cm. By modelling the curves P(alpha) - normalised light power transmitted versus injection angle - it was shown that the specific absorption of methane in cryptophane A led to an increase of the refractive index of the specific cladding. Detection limit for methane is 2 % (v/v) with cryptophane A and 6 % (v/v) with cryptophane E. When alkane concentrations (methane, ethane, butane) are less than 8 % (v/v), only methane leads to an optical response. For concentrations of alkanes higher than 15 % (v/v), a strong effect of condensation of butane in the polymer itself is observed...|$|R

The floors were made of precast concrete coffered units over which a reinforced concrete floor was cast. For the cladding Madin offered the council a choice of Portland Stone or Travertine Marble to align with the adjacent civic buildings.

The outcome and the analyses of these <b>uncladded</b> and cladded beams containing the surface or embedded cracks are shown. By means of the finite element method, local approach methods and the Weibull stress models the specimens are analysed at the test temperatures and the probability of failure is calculated, taking into account constraint effects.

Both crack fronts of the embedded crack are supposed to fail at the same failure moment. The results of the analysis of the cladded beam showed that the upper crack front nearer to the surface fails prior to the lower crack front, which is located deeper in the specimen (the failure moment is 5 % lower). The numerical results agree very well with the experiments. The experimental failure moments could be well predicted and the failure scenario (which crack front fails first) could be determined.

40|$|Guided wave modes in cladded or <b>uncladded</b> fiber-reinforced {{composite}} {{plates and}} tubes have been analyzed using a stiffness method {{in which the}} displacement variation through the thickness is approximated by polynomial interpolation functions.

A hybrid modeling technique is described in which an inner region containing cracks (or other defects) is discretized by finite elements, and {{the field in the}} exterior region is represented in terms of modes that are found using the stiffness method described above.

40|$|In high {{performance}} electronic systems, with increasing chip speed and {{larger number of}} processors, the system performance is being limited by off-chip metal interconnects. In such systems, polymer optical waveguides are being considered to replace electrical interconnects because of their high capacity for bandwidth and less constraints on interconnect length. The optical loss in the polymer optical waveguides is the key criterion used to evaluate their performance, and is significantly affected by thermal curing and aging. The evolution of degree-of-cure is determined from differential scanning calorimetry and compared to optical absorption from spectroscopy. Optical loss due to scattering mechanisms is related to local density fluctuations, which is studied using dielectric analysis. Based on the optical loss trends in <b>uncladded</b> and cladded waveguides, the underlying mechanisms for the optical loss variations are proposed and a cure process schedule to realize the lowest optical loss is recommended. Process-induced thermal stresses can also affect the polymer waveguide by introducing stress birefringence. The stress-optical coefficients of the siloxane polymer are extracted and employed in a numerical modeling method to determine the stress-induced birefringence in an optical waveguide system. The thermal-aging dependent optical loss is determined for waveguide samples at several different accelerated temperature conditions. To get the field-use conditions, the temperature distribution {{in the vicinity of}} the embedded laser and the polymer waveguide is determined. Using such thermal experimental data, the analytical reliability models were employed to relate the optical loss with time, and provide a practical way of determining whether the optical waveguides would perform within the optical loss budget during field-use conditions.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the design and}} {{characterization}} of a high resolution wavelength dependent pH optical sensor fabricated using the layer-by-layer technique was undertaken. In this approach, brilliant yellow (BY) as a pH indicator and poly (allylamine hydrochloride) [PAH] as a cross-linker have been deposited on an <b>uncladded</b> silica fibre. A number of key parameters, such {{as the number of}} bilayers, the concentration of the BY solution and the shape of the fibre, as well as its core diameter have been varied with a view to optimizing the design and performance of the pH sensor. The results obtained from a series of evaluations show that the sensitivity was enhanced by reducing the concentration of the indicator solution used and by designing a U-bend configuration sensor probe with a sharply bent fibre. However, when making an overall comparison, the straight (unbent) fibre probe resulted in a more sensitive probe when compared to the use of a high radius bend. Further, utilizing a small core diameter of the fibre allows a wide pH range to be measured and with high sensitivity. Additionally, the performance was shown to be improved for measurements over a narrower range of pH, by using a fibre with a larger core diameter. Considering the effect of the number of layers, work carried out has shown that probes with 5 - 6 bilayers presented the best performance. The sensitivity has been shown to diminish when more than 6 layers were used and the sensing range shifts towards higher pH values. When monitored, the value of pKa (the dissociation constant) of the thin film showed the smallest change of any of the design factors considered. In summary, using a larger core diameter, employing a larger curve radius, a higher number of bilayers, a higher concentration of the indicator solution and applying PAH as an outer layer, all cause a higher pKa value and consequently the probe sensitivity moves towards alkaline region...|$|R
