40|$|Polymorphisms in {{the human}} {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA) class I genes can cause the rejection of pluripotent stem cell (PSC) -derived products in allogeneic recipients. Disruption of the Beta- 2 Microglobulin (B 2 M) gene eliminates surface expression of all class I molecules, but leaves the cells vulnerable to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells. Here we show that this 'missing-self' response can be prevented by forced expression of minimally polymorphic HLA-E molecules. We use adeno-associated virus (AAV) -mediated gene editing to knock in HLA-E genes at the B 2 M locus in human PSCs {{in a manner that}} confers inducible, regulated, surface expression of HLA-E single-chain dimers (fused to B 2 M) or trimers (fused to B 2 M and a peptide antigen), without surface expression of HLA-A, B or C.

30|$|Stem cell {{treatments}} are a desirable therapeutic option to regenerate myocardium and improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction. Several {{different types of}} cells have been explored, each with their own benefits and limitations. Induced pluripotent stem cells possess an embryonic-like state and therefore have a high proliferative capacity, but they also pose a risk of teratoma formation. Mesenchymal stem cells have been investigated from both bone marrow and adipose tissue. Their immunomodulatory characteristics may {{permit the use of}} allogeneic <b>cells</b> as <b>universal</b> <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> in the future. Lastly, studies have consistently shown that cardiac stem cells are better able to express markers of cardiogenesis compared to other cell types, as well improve cardiac function. The ideal source of stem cells depends on multiple factors such as the ease of extraction/isolation, effectiveness of engraftment, ability to differentiate into cardiac lineages and effect on cardiac function. Although multiple studies highlight the benefits and limitations of each cell type and reinforce the successful potential use of these cells to regenerate damaged myocardium, more studies are needed to directly compare cells from various sources. It {{is interesting to note that}} research using stem cell therapies is also expanding to treat other cardiovascular diseases including non-ischemic cardiomyopathies.|$|R

This study examined whether xenogeneic bone marrow stromal cells implanted immediately after myocardial infarction can survive and differentiate, attenuating deterioration in left ventricular function. MethodsIn groups I and II (n = 34), myocardial infarctions were created in immunocompetent adult Lewis rats by proximal left coronary artery ligation. In group I, 3 × 106 lacZ-labeled mouse bone marrow stromal cells were immediately injected into the peri-infarct area of the left ventricle, whereas in group II, only culture medium was injected. There were 10 early and 4 late deaths. At 4 weeks after injection, hearts were stained for β-galactosidase and troponin IC. In groups IIIA and IIIB, lacZ-labeled mouse skin fibroblasts were implanted into rat myocardium (n = 10 each) with and without left coronary artery ligation, respectively, and the rats were killed serially. In group IV, animals underwent sham surgery (n = 5, no deaths). At 4 weeks, surviving rats in groups I, II, and IV (n = 10, n = 10, and n = 5, respectively) underwent blinded transthoracic echocardiography for ventricular function studies. ResultsIn group I, labeled mouse-derived bone marrow stromal cells were found within rat myocardium that stained positively for troponin IC 4 weeks after implantation. Functionally, mean left ventricular ejection fraction (P =. 007), stroke volume (P =. 03), and fractional shortening (P =. 02) were all significantly higher in group I than in group II. In groups IIIA and IIIB, mouse fibroblasts induced cellular infiltration with rapid loss of <b>donor</b> <b>cells.</b> No labeled cells were found after 4 days. In group IV, there was no change in cardiac function. ConclusionXenogeneic bone marrow stromal cells implanted into acutely ischemic myocardium induced by coronary artery ligation were immunologically tolerated, survived and differentiated, resulting in a cardiac chimera which improved left ventricular function. This unique immunologic tolerance may suggest the feasibility of using bone marrow stromal <b>cells</b> as <b>universal</b> <b>donor</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
30|$|Currently, most CAR T {{clinical}} trials utilize autologous T cells and might therefore be {{hampered by the}} poor {{quality and quantity of}} T cells and by the time and expense of manufacturing autologous T cell products. CAR T cell therapy could substantially benefit from allogeneic <b>universal</b> <b>donor</b> T <b>cells,</b> as “off-the-shelf” cells could greatly increase the number of patients who could be treated by a single CAR T cell product. However, endogenous TCR on allogeneic T cells may recognize the alloantigens of the recipient, leading to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); furthermore, the expression of HLA on the surface of allogeneic T cells causes rapid rejection by the host immune system. In this context, ZFNs and TALENs have been used to knock out endogenous T cell receptor genes in T cells, which could prevent unwanted graft-versus-host reactivity (Provasi et al., 2012; Torikai et al., 2012; Poirot et al., 2015). Genome-editing strategies could also be used to prevent or delay the rejection of CAR T cells by the recipient’s immune system by eliminating or decreasing the expression of histocompatibility antigens on the <b>donor</b> T <b>cells.</b> Future CAR T cell therapies could benefit from combined modification of endogenous TCR genes, histocompatibility genes, and components of signalling pathways. In a previous study, we reported the use of the CRISPR/Cas 9 system to simultaneously disrupt multiple genomic loci. CAR T cells deficient in the expression of endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) and HLA class I (HLA-I) were generated that can be used as universal CAR T cells (Ren et al., 2016).|$|R

Based on the recent finding that the best correlate of protection against the first protective prophylactic RV 144 vaccine were HIV-specific antibody responses, including those mediating natural killer (NK) cell antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), there has been considerable interest in measuring alternative roles for HIV-specific binding antibodies. The aim of this MSc dissertation was to optimise and compare two high-throughput flow cytometry based approaches - the GranToxilux and PanToxilux assays - to measure HIV-specific ADCC responses. To do this, NK cells from a panel of healthy HIV-negative individuals were screened {{for their ability to}} directly kill the tumour cell line K 562, as a measure of direct NK cell cytotoxicity.

In Experiment 1, fetal fibroblasts were permeabilized by digitonin, incubated in egg extractand, after re-sealing of cell membranes, cultured for 3 or 5 days before use as <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> in handmade cloning (HMC). Controls were produced by HMC with non-treated <b>donor</b> <b>cells.</b> The blastocyst rate for reconstructed embryos increased significantly when digitonin-permeabilized, extract-treated cells were used after 5 days of culture after re-sealing. In Experiment 2, fetal and adult fibroblasts were treated with digitonin alone before re-sealing the cell membranes, then cultured for 3 or 5 days and used as <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> in HMC. Treatment with digitonin alone increased the blastocyst rate, but only when fetal, and not adult fibroblasts, were used as <b>donor</b> <b>cells,</b> and only after 3 days of culture. In conclusion, we find a time window for increased efficiency of porcine SCNT using <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> after pre-treatment with permeabilization/re-sealing and Xenopus egg extract.

To determine whether the genetic diversity between <b>donor</b> <b>cell</b> and recipient cytoplast mitochondrial DNA influences development, we generated bovine embryos by fusing a <b>donor</b> <b>cell</b> to one or more enucleated cytoplasts. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA from embryos, fetal tissues, and blood samples from offspring revealed that early preimplantation embryos from two or three cytoplasts had significantly more mitochondrial DNA variants than fetal tissues.

In heteroplasmic tissue and blood samples, the predominant mitochondrial DNA population was significantly more divergent from the <b>donor</b> <b>cell</b> than the less frequent allele. Furthermore, analysis of the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome B gene showed that two heteroplasmic alleles encoded for different amino acids, and the ratios of mitochondrial DNA/mRNA for each allele differed significantly between tissues. The degree of evolutionary distance between the <b>donor</b> <b>cell</b> and the cytoplast and the variability in heteroplasmy between tissues may have an impact on more divergent intergeneric nuclear transfer and the use of this approach for the generation of embryonic stem cells. ...|$|R

More embryos developed into blas-tocysts in the Xenopus egg extract-treated group than in the control (13. 4 – 1. 9 % vs. 9. 1 – 1. 9 %, p = 0. 01). Further-more, scriptaid treatment of cloned embryos further increased the frequency of development to blastocyst, compared to the control reconstructed with the same extract-treated cells (22. 5 – 0. 9 % vs. 15. 3 – 0. 9 %, p < 0. 01). In addition, egg extract treatments increased the cell number in the blastocysts. This study demonstrated that Xenopus egg extract treatment reduced <b>donor</b> <b>cell</b> DNA methylation and enhanced the SCNT embryo develop-ment. Moreover, the combined treatments of <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> with egg extract before nuclear transfer and of cloned embryos with scriptaid could improve cloned embryo development additively.

40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} that a {{perioperative}} injection of <b>donor</b> mononuclear <b>cells</b> in combination with cyclosporine treatment on day 2 after transplantation prolongs heart allograft survival in rats. In this study we determined whether the efficacy of this treatment {{was influenced by the}} same factors that have been shown to affect the efficacy of preoperative administration of <b>donor</b> <b>cells.</b> The effect of the following factors were investigated: dosage and repetition of the <b>donor</b> <b>cell</b> injection, viability of the <b>donor</b> <b>cells,</b> immunosuppressive drugs other than cyclosporine, and the rat strain combination. We found that there was an optimal dosage of donor cells; dosages of 4 x 10 (7) or 1 x 10 (8) cells gave the best heart graft survival. Repetition of the <b>donor</b> <b>cell</b> injection was not useful. Reducing viability of the cells by irradiation did not abrogate the prolonged graft survival, whereas killing of the cells did. Methylprednisolone, azathioprine, or cyclophosphamide in combination with the perioperative <b>donor</b> <b>cell</b> injection did not prolong heart graft survival in comparison with treatment with the drug only. The efficacy of this treatment was also influenced by the rat strain combination. In some combinations, this treatment prolonged graft survival, whereas in others an effect was absent or undetectable. Importantly, this treatment never adversely affected graft survival. We conclude that the efficacy of this treatment is influenced by similar factors as found for preoperative treatment with <b>donor</b> <b>cells.</b> A major advantage of this treatment over preoperative blood transfusions is that it avoids sensitization...|$|R
40|$|Normal and isoimmune C 3 H and C 57 BL spleen {{cells were}} {{transferred}} intravenously into normal and irradiated allogeneic recipients and {{the fate of}} the <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> determined by differential cytotoxicity and radioautographic techniques. It was found that spleen cells sensitized against their prospective recipients could be identified in the host's spleen for 1 day, whereas normal <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> survived 2 to 3 days. Spleen cells presensitized with an indifferent antigen had survival times similar to normal <b>donor</b> <b>cells.</b> Irradiation of the recipients prior to cell transfer eliminated any difference in survival times between normal and presensitized <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> in allogeneic hosts. It is concluded that the host {{plays an important role in}} the rapid destruction of spleen cells presensitized against host antigens. Experiments in which sensitized and normal C 57 BL spleen cells were mixed and transferred into normal C 3 H mice indicated that as little as 5 to 10 per cent of the <b>donor</b> <b>cell</b> population need be sensitized for the entire mixture to behave as if it were obtained from a sensitized animal, as shown by its elimination in the 1 -day interval...|$|R
40|$|Enterococcus faecalis is a gram {{positive}} bacterium normally {{residing in}} human intestine {{as a component}} of natural flora. It may act as a pathogen, however, for people with impaired immune system. Enterococcus faecalis is very efficient in acquiring resistance to antibiotics. One of its strains has been identified to be resistant to vancomycin—a drug that is traditionally used as the last resort. Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistance to antibiotics within and across species. The transfer process of antibiotic resistance takes place through the transfer of plasmids— small circular DNA with genes encoded for antibiotic resistance. The most common and powerful way to transfer plasmids is conjugation. In our experiment, during the process of conjugation, cells without the desired plasmid (recipient cells) release signaling molecules (cCF 10) into the environment, and induce the host <b>cells</b> (<b>donor</b> <b>cells)</b> with the desired plasmid. Once the <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> are induced, they will conjugate with recipient cells and transfer the plasmid of interest—pCF 10 which contains genes for antibiotic resistance, to the recipient cells. The initial recipient cells are thus converted to transconjugant cells, capable of acting as <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> eventually. In order to prevent self-induction by the cCF 10 generated by <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> themselves, <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> produce an inhibiting signaling pheromone, iCF 10. cCF 10 and iCF 10 competeswith each other, and only when cCF 10 exists in a high enough concentration would the <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> be induced...|$|R
40|$|Microsurgical {{models of}} vein-to-artery graft surgery have been {{developed}} in rats {{as a means of}} assessing vein graft adaptation and neo-intimal hyperplasia. Neo-intimal hyperplasia in these grafts is often attributed, at least in part, to an adaptive response by venous smooth muscle cells to the increased intraluminal pressure of the arterial pressure. However, considerable evidence suggests complete or near-complete cellular replacement in these grafts. A series of experiments were undertaken in which male vein or artery grafts were placed into either allogeneic female nude rat hosts or into syngeneic WKy female hosts as a means of determining <b>donor</b> <b>cell</b> survival. Grafts were removed at postsurgery week 2 or week 6 and the fate of the <b>donor</b> male <b>cells</b> assessed by PCR amplification of the testis-determining gene Sry. The Sry gene was undetectable in 2 -week male to female vein grafts. When left for 6 weeks, <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> were detectable in vein grafts only after multiple 50 -cycle PCR analyses. Minimal <b>donor</b> <b>cell</b> survival was not due to an allograft response, as <b>donor</b> male <b>cells</b> were readily detectable in WKy male to female nude rat artery-to-artery grafts. These data were not nude rat specific, as poor <b>donor</b> <b>cell</b> survival was also evidenced in syngeneic male to female vein-to-artery grafts. In conclusion, we demonstrate only marginal survival of <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> in rat vein-to-artery grafts. Neo-intimal hyperplasia in these grafts was not a consequence of donor venous smooth muscle cell proliferation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Donor</b> <b>cell</b> leukemia after {{allogeneic}} hema-topoietic {{stem cell}} transplantation might provide a unique human model for {{our understanding of}} leukemogenesis in vivo. We hypothesized that the “ 2 -genetic-hits model ” {{may contribute to the}} “leukemiza-tion ” of <b>donor</b> <b>cells</b> and first evaluated these genetic mutations that are impli-cated in the development of acute my-eloid leukemia in a <b>donor</b> <b>cell</b> leukemia patient and donor. The patient and his donor-sister both harbored a germline mutation in CEBPA (584 _ 589 dup). Suscep-tible <b>donor</b> hematopoietic <b>cells</b> evolved to overt acute myeloid leukemia by devel-oping 2 somatic CEBPA mutations (247 dupC and 914 _ 916 dup) in the pa-tient’s microenvironment. These were identical to the acquired mutations identi-fied in leukemic cells that originated from the patient during de novo acute myeloid leukemia. Our results provide the first report of multiple mutations of CEBPA contributing to the transformation of do-nor cells to the leukemic phenotype and provide clues to support the multiple-genetic-hits mechanism of <b>donor</b> <b>cell</b> leu-kemia.
