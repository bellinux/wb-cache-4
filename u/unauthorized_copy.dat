Wolfgang met Josef Mysliveček and Giovanni Battista Martini in Bologna, and was accepted {{as a member of}} the famous Accademia Filarmonica.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of peer production {{in the context of}} <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copying</b> of information goods. Acc. to Yochai Benkler, it is a form of production operation based on a community. It is widely applied in the Internet and consequently, such information goods as GNU/Linux and Wikipedia have been established. Although the peer production has promoted growth in importance of, among others, free software or an open source initiative, it is also related to <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copying</b> of an intellectual property commonly called Internet piracy. The huge scale of this phenomenon, which is nearly 24 % of entire Internet traffic, must not be ignored. In the paper a hypothesis has been put forward that low efficiency of counteracting of intellectual property <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copying</b> results from that fact that, to a great extent, it is generated in a process of the peer production. In turn, the goal of the paper is verification of the thesis in the progress of considerations regarding the nature of both the peer production and the <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copying.</b> A research field was limited to a P 2 P file exchange network based on a BitTorrent protocol. peer production; unauthorized copying; intellectual property; BitTorren...|$|R

Our research attempts to determine the source of <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copies</b> by studying the availability and characteristics of recent popular movies in file sharing networks. We developed a data set of 312 popular movies and located one or more samples of 183 of these movies on file sharing networks, for a total of 285 movie samples. 77 % of these samples appear to have been leaked by industry insiders. Most of our samples appeared on file sharing networks prior to their official consumer DVD release date. Indeed, of the movies that had been released on DVD as of the time of our study, only 5 % first appeared after their DVD release date on a web site that indexes file sharing networks, indicating that consumer DVD copying currently represents a relatively minor factor compared with insider leaks.

40|$|Software piracy {{has been}} studied by academics, {{software}} firms, law enforcement agents and policy makers for many years. Previous research in software piracy either did not differentiate between <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copying</b> and <b>unauthorized</b> sharing, or focused only on <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copying.</b> We believe the motivating factors behind the two behaviors are quite different because beneficiaries of the behaviors are different. In this paper, we consider unauthorized sharing {{as a kind of}} helping behavior and draw on relevant literature to see if the motivations behind unauthorized sharing can be better appreciated from an affective perspective. We tested the affective model of unauthorized sharing based on empirical data obtained from a large-scale survey. We found from the survey that both perceived affordability and perceived convenience could arouse sympathy or annoyance with the unauthorized copier, and their effects were mediated by perceived controllability of the need of <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copying.</b> Our results support the strong effects of affective factors on the moral obligation of unauthorized sharing...|$|R
