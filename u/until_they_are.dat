5|$|Depending on maturity, breed, {{and work}} expected, horses are usually put under saddle and {{trained to be}} ridden {{between the ages of}} two and four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries, horses {{specifically}} bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a full 60calendar months (five years) old.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch after 53 to 60days of {{incubation}} by both parents. Chicks {{are born}} with their eyes open and sometimes {{can take up to}} a week to leave the shell completely. The young are covered with a grayish down <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after five to six months, but continue to roost and forage with their parents <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in their second year, at which point the parents typically turn their energies to a new nest. Ravens are the main predatory threat to condor eggs, while golden eagles and bears are potential predators of condor offspring.|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} cub {{emerges in}} most litters, usually a male. This cub is more active than its siblings {{and takes the}} lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier. The cubs open their eyes at six to fourteen days old. By eight weeks, the cubs make short ventures outside the den with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> older. The cubs are nursed for three to six months. Around {{the time they are}} weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and they are taught how to hunt. The cubs often become capable (and nearly adult size) hunters at eleven months old. The cubs become independent around eighteen months of age, but it is not <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> around two to {{two and a half years}} old that they fully separate from their mother. Females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males do so at four to five years.|$|E

The infrastructure that tours with each show could easily be called a mobile village; it includes the Grand Chapiteau, a large entrance tent, artistic tent, kitchen, school, and other items necessary to support the cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years, the {{original}} Piagetian object permanence account {{has been challenged}} {{by a series of}} infant studies suggesting that much younger infants do have a clear sense that objects exist even when out of sight. Bower showed object permanence in 3-month-olds. This goes against Piaget's coordination of secondary circular reactions stage because infants aren't supposed to understand that a completely hidden object still exists <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> eight to twelve months old. The two studies below demonstrate this idea.|$|E

The club was the regional Second Division champions for the season, together with UDESCAI, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> competing in the Premier Division for the season.|$|R
5|$|In some species, {{offspring}} {{may become}} independent {{around the next}} spring, through some may stay until the female successfully mates again. Bears reach sexual maturity shortly after they disperse; at around 3–6 years depending on the species. Male Alaskan brown bears and polar bears may continue to grow <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> 11 years old. Lifespan may also vary between species. The brown bear can live an average of 25 years.|$|E
5|$|Males mature {{at around}} 15years of age, {{by which time}} they have fully descended {{testicles}} and can reproduce. However, they exhibit arrested development by not developing the distinctive cheek pads, pronounced throat pouches, long fur, or long-calls <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> between 15 and 20years old. The development of these characteristics depends largely on {{the absence of a}} resident male.|$|E

5|$|The film follows Kaspar Jørgensen, a Danish poet in the 1940s who {{is seeking}} inspiration. At the {{suggestion}} of his psychiatrist, Dr. Mørk, he travels to Norway to meet the famous author Sigrid Undset. However, after arriving in Norway, he meets Ingeborg, a farmer's daughter, and they fall in love. He proposes to her, but discovers that she is already engaged, at her father's wish. She promises not to cut her hair <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> reunited, and Kaspar returns to Denmark.|$|E
5|$|The length time {{in which}} {{offspring}} stay with their mother varies, though it can last until the female's next calving. Likewise, calves may suckle for only a month or {{as long as a}} year. Females become sexually mature when they are four years old, while males become mature at four or five years. Spermatogenesis in male giraffes begins at three to four years of age. Males must wait <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.|$|E
5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the frogs are {{voracious}} eaters of insects, {{but will also}} eat larger prey, such as worms and mice. Unlike most frogs, they are active at day, although this is mostly to warm in the sun. They {{tend to be less}} active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E

5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into the water column, while others have developed a number of mechanisms for {{holding on to the}} eggs <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> ready to hatch. Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and thoracic limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects. Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs; some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs, while others have them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} control which genes are being transcribed, the cell {{separates}} some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical {{access to the}} DNA <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, {{in the case of}} NF-κB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen), {{former head}} of Project Alice {{and the head of}} the North American Umbrella facility, {{operated}} in Nevada, considers Alice's recapture to be a top priority, since she has the ability to bond with the T-virus and not suffer mutation. He tries to persuade the Umbrella board, operating via holograms from the worldwide Umbrella facility, that he can use her blood to develop a permanent cure as well as tame the infected zombies. The new Umbrella chairman Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara) orders Isaacs to use the clones to create a cure, and he refuses to authorize Alice's recapture <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> informed of her location.|$|E

5|$|Reach {{features}} updated {{versions of}} old weapons, plus new weapons fulfilling various combat roles. In Halo 3, players can carry single-use equipment power-ups that offer temporary offensive or defensive advantages. This system of single-use equipment is replaced in Reach by reusable and persistent armor abilities that remain with a character <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> replaced. The abilities are a jetpack; active camouflage; sprint; hologram, which creates a facsimile {{of the player}} running towards a target point; drop shield, which creates a bubble that heals those inside and protects them from {{a limited amount of}} damage; and armor lock, which immobilizes the player but grants invincibility for a brief period of time. When playing as Covenant Elites, players also have access to an evade armor ability.|$|E
