5|$|Occasionally, {{groups may}} split <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> become {{so large that}} {{competition}} for resources is problematic, but even then, members of matrilines tend to stick together. Dominant females procure more food, matings, and supporters. Among olive baboons in Tanzania, high-ranking females give birth at shorter intervals to infants with a higher survival rate, and their daughters tend to mature faster than low-ranking females. However, these high-ranking females also {{appear to have a}} higher probability of miscarriages and some high-ranking matrilines have inexplicably low fertility. One theory suggests this occurs due to stress on the high-ranking females, although this theory is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Paul and Helen {{move to the}} United States, marry, and Helen {{gives birth}} to the narrator. However, she becomes {{depressed}} a few months afterwards. She later confesses that she feared the taint of the vampiric bite that she acquired earlier would infect her child. The family travels to Europe {{in an attempt to}} cheer her <b>up.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> visit the monastery Saint-Matthieu-des-Pyrénées-Orientales, Helen feels Dracula's presence and is compelled to jump off a cliff. Landing on grass, she survives and decides to hunt him down and kill him in order to rid herself of his threat and her fears.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{has since}} become {{a prime example of}} successful crew resource management. For much of aviation's history, the captain was considered the final authority, and crews were to respect the captain's expertise and not question him. This began to change in the 1970s, especially after the Tenerife airport disaster. Crew Resource Management, while still considering the captain the final authority, instructs crewmembers to speak <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> detect a problem, and instructs captains to listen to their concerns. United Airlines instituted a Crew Resource Management class in the early 1980s. The NTSB would later credit this training as valuable toward the success of United 232's crew in handling their emergency. The FAA made Crew Resource Training mandatory {{in the aftermath of the}} accident.|$|E

5|$|Chris is {{suspended}} from school {{when he gets}} into a fight with a rival basketball captain. When his parents {{find out about the}} fight and that he is gay, they throw Chris out and he stays with Summer. She later breaks down and reveals that she is struggling with his sexuality. Chris reassures her that it is not her fault he is gay and their friendship becomes stronger. Chris befriends Natasha and helps her and Summer to make <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> fall out. After receiving lower grades than expected, Chris reconsiders attending university. He gets a job at Fitzgerald Motors, upsetting his father, George, who wants him to go to university. To keep George happy, Chris begins attending TAFE. A customer, Warren Burrell, makes derogatory comments about gay people and makes Chris feel uncomfortable. Warren's son, Blake, befriends Chris and apologises for his father. Warren witnesses them playing pool and warns Chris to stay away from Blake. Chris is later attacked while working and Lucas takes him to the hospital, but Chris leaves before getting his x-rays. He later collapses and Rhys Lawson has to perform emergency surgery to get Chris breathing again.|$|E

25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that {{time there was a}} deep cave on the mountain, which is buried today. Bursting with curiosity they wanted to know what was inside. One of them was lowered by rope down into the deep hole. Beforehand the boys had decided to pull him up {{immediately}} when he gave a tug on the rope. Soon after the boy went into the cave, a three-legged rabbit hobbled across the way, the other lads followed it spontaneously in order to catch it, but the farther they chased the faster the rabbit ran. Finally they gave <b>up.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there hung a goat's hoof, but the boy was gone forever.|$|E

25|$|The {{battalion}} {{moved to}} Majdal Shams, {{from where it}} began to ascend the mountain. The reconnaissance company moved far to the left.

These were accompanied by artillery, firing 200 yards ahead, but it was ordered to stop when it began to hit too close to the troops. After nine hours of climbing they were two thirds of the way <b>up,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were hit by heavy fire. Five of the six tank commanders in the motorized force were hit by Syrian commandos lying {{at the side of the}} road. The reconnaissance company was also hit and its commander was killed. The exchange of fire took place at range of a few yards. In addition to snipers, the Syrians also used Israeli machine guns taken from the outpost after the first battle.|$|E

When Leon demands the truth, Lucy tells him she had an abortion.|$|E
25|$|The {{founding}} members are the protagonist, Morgana, Ryuji and Ann. On subsequent heists, they {{are joined by}} Yusuke, Makoto, Futaba and Haru. As their numbers and successes grow, they {{attract the attention of}} public and police including Sae and detective prodigy Goro Akechi. They learn that a secret conspiracy is manipulating events behind the scenes, and is directly connected to some of the Phantom Thieves' reasons for joining. Haru's father tries to reveal this group's leader after he is reformed, but an assassin kills him. In their pursuit of the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, and goes on a mission into Sae's Palace when she discovers their identities. Following her defeat, the group is forced to split <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are confronted by police, and the protagonist is arrested, leading to the interrogation in the frame story.

The protagonist convinces Sae of his righteousness and hatches a scheme to use the reality within Sae's still-intact Palace to save himself when Akechi attempts to kill him in a staged suicide. Failure to complete any Palace prior to this point or revealing the identities of the other Phantom Thieves results in Akechi killing the protagonist.|$|E
