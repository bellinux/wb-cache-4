50|$|The name Rebetli and Betli of Hearts {{are both}} {{commonly}} used, however, the latter suggests a trump suit despite Betli being a no-trump bet. The misleading suffix merely {{points to the}} fact that the bet is double value and its <b>use</b> is <b>advised</b> <b>against.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{contraindicated}} {{in individuals}} with either acquired, congenital {{or a family}} history of QT interval prolongation. Its <b>use</b> is <b>advised</b> <b>against</b> in individuals with people with either a personal or {{a family history of}} arrhythmias or torsades de pointes. Likewise its <b>use</b> is also <b>advised</b> <b>against</b> in individuals with uncorrected hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia or clinical significant cardiac disorders (e.g. a recent myocardial infarction or bradycardia. It is also contraindicated in individuals being cotreated with SSRIs or in those with a known hypersensitivity to pimozide or other diphenylbutyl-piperidine derivatives. Likewise its use is contraindicated in individuals receiving treatment with CYP3A4, CYP1A2, or CYP2D6 inhibitors.|$|R

50|$|Its <b>use</b> is also <b>advised</b> <b>against</b> in {{individuals}} concurrently on monoamine oxidase inhibitors {{or if they}} have been on one in the past 14 days and {{in individuals}} on drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval (e.g. ondansetron, citalopram, pimozide, sertindole, ziprasidone, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, etc.).|$|R
50|$|Lin {{objected to}} the use of {{ractopamine}} in beef, and engaged in discussions and protests about the additive's use in United States beef imports to Taiwan. She proposed a related amendment grant the legislature the right to review safety levels for pesticide and drug residue in food. After the Codex Alimentarius Commission revised standards for ractopamine <b>use,</b> Lin <b>advised</b> <b>against</b> loosening Taiwanese regulations. After a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy surfaced in the United States in April, Lin proposed a ban on American beef imports in Taiwan.|$|R

Its use is also recommended against in the following disease states: ...|$|R
40|$|In {{statistical}} analyses the researcher should normally {{use all the}} relevant information in the data. This argument has been <b>used</b> to <b>advise</b> <b>against</b> the habit of dichotomizing (approximately) continuous variables. However, if, for instance, a continuous variable is not normally distributed, {{it is possible that}} an optimal dichotomization can reveal relationships between variables otherwise obscured. Two analytical situations when this might apply were treated: 1. The study of the relationship between an independent dichotomous grouping variable and a dependent continuous variable and 2. the discrimination between two groups by identifying an optimal cutpoint in one or more continuous ariables, treated as the predictor(s). For these purposes, cutpoint analysis (CPA) is introduced as a method for finding an optimal categorization of a continuous variable together with a computer package (ROPstat) to carry out the analysis. Three empirical examples are given that show the usefulness of CPA as compared to conventional analyses...|$|R

25|$|Its <b>use</b> is <b>advised</b> <b>against</b> {{in people}} on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, {{ritonavir}} and nefazodone {{due to its}} reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates {{of any of these}} enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could be true of itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St. John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of prehospital reduction of shoulder dislocation by paramedics {{is a huge}} departure from previous teachings. Although shoulder reduction is recommended for use in specific circumstances, such as wilderness areas, little published evidence exists either to provide a solid foundation for its prehospital <b>use,</b> or <b>advise</b> <b>against</b> the {{introduction of}} this procedure. Shoulder dislocations, while affecting {{a minority of the}} community, are painful and debilitating and require early reduction, as muscle spasm increases with time, making reduction more difficult. In areas associated with prolonged ambulance transport times, the delay to definitive treatment may cause needless pain and suffering to patients sustaining shoulder dislocation. In order to assess the risks and benefits of paramedic reduction of shoulder dislocation, this study systematically evaluated the available evidence. No evidence from clinical studies in the prehospital setting was found: studies from other health settings are used to synthesize recommendations for paramedic practice that enable timely, safe and humanitarian care of patients with shoulder dislocation...|$|R

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century, sports consisted in a minimum amount of physical activity. It was generally considered as dangerous and unhealthy because it encouraged people to push their limits too far. The medical profession <b>used</b> to <b>advise</b> teenagers <b>against</b> doing any sport, for fear that they would become too tired and, as a result, their bodies would not develop properly (Arnaud, 1980; Defrance, 2003). Nevertheless, during this period, some doctors became interested in sports. Some were former sportsmen, others had worked for the army (Pociello, 1999) which was involved in research to improve the physical skills of their soldiers. They observed that the body was a wonderful product of nature...|$|R
5000|$|Before the 2010 season, La Russa {{confirmed}} that Mark McGwire {{would become the}} Cardinals' hitting coach after years of self-induced public exile since retiring as a player in 2001. Months after his hire in January, 2010, he publicly admitted to steroid use through parts of his career, including his home run record-breaking season in 1998, and issued a public apology. Commissioner Selig was pleased with McGwire's announcement, adding that [...] "this statement of contrition I believe will make Mark's re-entry into the game much smoother and easier." [...] La Russa stated that, before that day, he [...] "didn’t know anything. Mark and I never confronted it, and he never told me until this morning." [...] McGwire remarked that during the 2005 Congressional hearings, he was then ready to admit to his steroid <b>use,</b> but lawyers <b>advised</b> <b>against</b> it to attempt to attain immunity.|$|R
2500|$|Clomipramine may {{interact}} {{with a number}} of different medications, including the monoamine oxidase inhibitors which include isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, selegiline and tranylcypromine, antiarrhythmic agents (due to the effects of TCAs like clomipramine on cardiac conduction. There is also a potential pharmacokinetic interaction with quinidine {{due to the fact that}} clomipramine is metabolised by CYP2D6 in vivo), diuretics (due to the potential for hypokalaemia (low blood potassium) to develop which increases the risk for QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes), the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; due to both potential additive serotonergic effects leading to serotonin syndrome and the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with the SSRIs that inhibit CYP2D6 [...] ) and serotonergic agents such as triptans, other tricyclic antidepressants, tramadol, etc. (due to the potential for serotonin syndrome). Its <b>use</b> is also <b>advised</b> <b>against</b> in those concurrently on CYP2D6 inhibitors due the potential for increased plasma levels of clomipramine and the resulting potential for CNS and cardiotoxicity.|$|R
