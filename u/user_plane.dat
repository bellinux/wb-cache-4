This paper describes a few features of a method independent, object-oriented development tool, essentially consisting of a <b>users</b> <b>plane,</b> where visual system construction takes place, a formal <b>plane,</b> where <b>user</b> actions are verified, and underlying platforms, providing user-formal mappings.

40|$|The {{proposed}} 3 GPP's 5 G Next-generation (NextGen) Core architecture (5 GC) {{enables the}} ability to introduce new <b>user</b> and control <b>plane</b> functions {{within the context of}} network slicing to allow greater flexibility in handling of heterogeneous devices and applications. In this paper, we discuss the integration of such architecture with future networking technologies by focusing on the information centric networking (ICN) technology. For that purpose, we first provide a short description of the proposed 5 GC, which is followed by a discussion on the extensions to 5 GC's control and <b>user</b> <b>planes</b> to support Protocol Data Unit (PDU) sessions from ICN. To illustrate the value of enabling ICN within 5 GC, we focus on two important network services that can be enabled by ICN data networks. The first case targets mobile edge computing for a connected car use case, whereas the second case targets seamless mobility support for ICN sessions. We present these discussions in consideration with the procedures proposed by 3 GPP's 23. 501 and 23. 502 technical specifications...|$|R

30|$|From a LALS perspective, {{the target}} {{positioning}} is not affected with {{the separation of}} the control and <b>user</b> <b>planes</b> because the mobility management for LCS is handled separately by the MME and is independent of the cellular service used. Same holds for the enhanced location for IRI, given that each user is served by only one control node which informs the MME and SMLC of the target identity using the service of interest for investigation. It is worth mentioning that LALS also need to be supported for MEC applications, where the service part of the service-based localization is offered on the local cloud. In this case, the LALS procedure shown in Fig.  6 stays the same; only the SMLC {{needs to be able to}} request the service details from the MEC server and include them in the subscriber location report back to the LEA.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} {{architectural}} variations {{as described in}} 3GPP TR23.830. The variations are driven by the following factors: 1) whether the HeNB-GW is present or not, and 2) if HeNB-GW is present, whether the S1 <b>User</b> <b>Plane</b> (S1-U) goes through it or not.|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{networks}} {{are vulnerable to}} signaling attacks and storms that are caused by traffic patterns that overload the control plane, and differ from distributed denial of service attacks in the Internet since they directly affect the control plane, and also reserve wireless bandwidth and network resources without actually using them. Such storms can result from malware and mobile botnets, {{as well as from}} poorly designed applications, and can cause service outages in 3 G and 4 G networks, which have been experienced by mobile operators. Since the radio resource control (RRC) protocol in the 3 G and 4 G networks is particularly susceptible to such storms, we analyze their effect with a mathematical model that helps to predict the congestion that is caused by a storm. A detailed simulation model of a mobile network is used to better understand the temporal dynamics of user behavior and signaling in the network and to show how RRC-based signaling attacks and storms cause significant problems in both the control and <b>user</b> <b>planes</b> of the network. Our analysis also serves to identify how storms can be detected, and to propose how system parameters can be chosen to mitigate their effect...|$|R
40|$|The 5 G ESSENCE project’s {{context is}} based on the concept of Edge Cloud Computing and Small Cell-as-a-Service (SCaaS) -as both have been {{previously}} identified in the SESAME 5 G-PPP project of phase 1 - and further “promotes” their role and/or influences within the related 5 G vertical markets. 5 G ESSENCE’s core innovation is focused upon the development/provision of a highly flexible and scalable platform, offering benefits to the involved market actors. The present work identifies a variety of challenges to be fulfilled by the 5 G ESSENCE, in the scope of an enhanced architectural framework. The proposed technical approach exploits the profits of the centralization of Small Cell functions as scale grows through an edge cloud environment, based on a two-tier architecture with the first distributed tier being for offering low latency services and the second centralized tier being for the provision of high processing power for computing-intensive network applications. This permits decoupling the control and <b>user</b> <b>planes</b> of the Radio Access Network (RAN) and achieving the advantages of Cloud-RAN without the enormous fronthaul latency restrictions. The use of end-to-end network slicing mechanisms allows for sharing the related infrastructure among multiple operators/vertical industries and customizing its capabilities on a per-tenant basis, creating a neutral host market and reducing operational costs...|$|R

50|$|The {{camera and}} point cloud {{need to be}} {{oriented}} {{in some kind of}} space. Therefore, once calibration is complete, it is necessary to define a ground plane. Normally, this is a unit plane that determines the scale, orientation and origin of the projected space.

The IP Multimedia Subsystem architecture uses the term transport plane to describe a function roughly equivalent to the routing control plane.|$|E

40|$|Personal robots are {{expected}} {{to interact with the}} user by recognizing the user's face. However, in most of the service robot applications, the user needs to move himself/herself to allow the robot to see him/her face to face. To overcome such limitations, a method for estimating human body orientation is required. Previous studies used various components such as feature extractors and classification models to classify the orientation which resulted in low performance. For a more robust and accurate approach, we propose the light weight convolutional neural networks, an end to end system, for estimating human body orientation. Our body orientation estimation model achieved 81. 58 % and 94 % accuracy with the benchmark dataset and our own dataset respectively. The proposed method {{can be used in a}} wide range of service robot applications which depend on the ability to estimate human body orientation. To show its usefulness in service robot applications, we designed a simple robot application which allows the robot to move towards the <b>user's</b> frontal <b>plane.</b> With this, we demonstrated an improved face detection rate...|$|R
