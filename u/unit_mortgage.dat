40|$|With another {{real estate}} boom-bust {{bringing}} woes {{to the world}} economy, a quest for a better policy toolkit {{to deal with these}} boom-busts has begun. Macroprudential measures could be in such a toolkit. Yet, we know very little about their impact. This paper takes a step to fill this gap by analyzing the Korean experience with these measures. We find that loan-to-value and debt-to-income limits are associated with a decline in house price appreciation and transaction activity. Furthermore, the limits alter expectations, which {{play a key role in}} bubble dynamics.

50|$|Meanwhile, {{with the}} farm economy {{going into a}} tailspin {{starting}} in 1981, Norwest began feeling the effects of its heavy farm loan portfolio--$1.2 billion, or seven percent of its overall loan portfolio. Norwest had another $1.2 billion in loans in foreign markets, which caused additional problems in the early 1980s as Norwest, like most U.S. banks, had made many bad loans overseas. As a result, Norwest saw its non-performing loans increase 500 percent from 1983 to 1984, to more than $500 million. Further trouble came from the bank's <b>mortgage</b> <b>unit,</b> Norwest <b>Mortgage</b> Inc., which had been quickly built into the second largest holder of mortgages in the United States. In the summer of 1984, Norwest Mortgage lost nearly $100 million from an unsuccessful effort to hedge its mounting interest-rate risk on adjustable-rate mortgages. The loan losses and the mortgage debacle led to a drop in net income from $125.2 million in 1983 to $69.5 million in 1984.|$|R
