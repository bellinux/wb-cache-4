5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is satisfied {{without the use}} of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be <b>uncovered.</b> Risk-neutral investors will be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the exchange rate between those countries is expected to adjust such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on euro deposits, thereby eliminating the potential for <b>uncovered</b> interest arbitrage profits. <b>Uncovered</b> interest rate parity helps explain the determination of the spot exchange rate. The following equation represents <b>uncovered</b> interest rate parity.|$|E

50|$|Pitches are {{produced}} on the recorder by covering the holes while blowing into the instrument. Modern terminology {{refers to the}} holes {{on the front of}} the instrument using the numbers 1 through 7, starting with the hole closest to the beak, with the thumbhole numbered hole 0. At the most basic level, the fingering technique of the recorder involves the sequential <b>uncovering</b> of the holes from lowest to highest (i.e. <b>uncovering</b> 7, then <b>uncovering</b> 7 and 6, then <b>uncovering</b> 7, 6 and 5, etc.) producing ever higher pitches. In practice, however, the <b>uncovering</b> of the holes is not strictly sequential, and the half covering or <b>uncovering</b> of holes is an essential part of recorder technique.|$|R

5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered interest rate parity generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and <b>uncovered</b> interest rate parity hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. This relationship can be employed to test whether <b>uncovered</b> interest rate parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When <b>uncovered</b> interest rate parity and purchasing power parity hold together, they illuminate a relationship named real interest rate parity, which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected adjustments in the real exchange rate. This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries.|$|E

5|$|<b>Uncovered</b> {{interest}} rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar deposits will earn the {{interest rate}} available on dollar deposits, while an investor holding euro deposits will earn {{the interest rate}} available in the eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of <b>uncovered</b> interest rate parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If <b>uncovered</b> interest rate parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits, then any excess return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected loss from depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Conversely, some shortfall in return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against the dollar. The following equation represents the <b>uncovered</b> interest rate parity approximation.|$|E
