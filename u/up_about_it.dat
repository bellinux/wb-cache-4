25|$|For {{the next}} several years Sara is abused by Miss Minchin and the other servants, except for Becky. Amelia deplores how Sara is treated but is too weak to speak <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Sara is starved, worked for long hours, sent out in all weathers, poorly dressed in outgrown and {{worn-out}} clothes, and deprived of warmth or a comfortable bed in the attic. Despite her hardships, Sara is consoled by her friends and uses her imagination to cope, pretending she is a prisoner in the Bastille or a princess disguised as a servant. Sara also continues to be kind and polite to everyone, including those who treat her badly. One day she finds a coin in the street and uses it to buy buns at a bakery, but despite being very hungry, she gives most of the buns away to a beggar girl dressed in rags who is hungrier than herself. The bakery shop owner sees this and wants to reward Sara, but she has disappeared, so the shop owner instead gives the beggar girl bread and warm shelter for Sara's sake.|$|E
500|$|Despite Travolta's earlier statements, {{plans for}} a sequel never came to fruition. According to James Robert Parish's Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, the {{disastrous}} performance of Battlefield Earth {{and the collapse of}} Franchise Pictures made it very unlikely that a live-action sequel will be made. In a 2001 interview, Travolta stated that a sequel was not planned: [...] "Ultimately the movie did $100million when you count box office, DVD sales, video, and pay per view… But I don't know what kind of number it would have to do to justify filming {{the second part of the}} book. And I don't want to push any buttons in the press and stir anybody <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> now." [...] Author Services announced in 2001 that Pine Com International, a Tokyo-based animation studio, would produce 13one-hour animated television segments based on the book and rendered in a manga style. The plans appear to have fallen through, and according to Parish, [...] "little has been heard of the series since." ...|$|E
500|$|Considering {{the idea}} of the fission bomb {{theoretically}} settled—at least until more experimental data was available—the Berkeley conference then turned in a different direction. Edward Teller pushed for discussion of a more powerful bomb: the [...] "super", now usually referred to as a [...] "hydrogen bomb", which would use the explosive force of a detonating fission bomb to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium. Teller proposed scheme after scheme, but Bethe refused each one. The fusion idea was put aside to concentrate on producing fission bombs. Teller also raised the speculative possibility that an atomic bomb might [...] "ignite" [...] the atmosphere because of a hypothetical fusion reaction of nitrogen nuclei. Bethe calculated that it could not happen, and a report co-authored by Teller showed that [...] "no self-propagating chain of nuclear reactions is likely to be started." [...] In Serber's account, Oppenheimer mentioned it to Arthur Compton, who [...] "didn't have enough sense to shut <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It somehow got into a document that went to Washington" [...] and was [...] "never laid to rest".|$|E

500|$|By 12 o'clock when I came in {{it looked}} as if we'd lost control of the whole thing. My first {{decision}} was to send a Governor 5 back up to the remand prison {{to see if we could}} hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties of one sort or another and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it. We rang staff <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> who said [...] "You must be joking, is this an April Fool?" [...] That's what happened when they rang up my home, my son thought it was an April Fool.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2001, Variety {{reported}} Sedaris {{had sold}} the Me Talk Pretty One Day film rights to director Wayne Wang, who was adapting four {{stories from the}} book for Columbia Pictures. Wang had completed the script and begun casting when Sedaris asked to [...] "get out of it", after he and his sister worried how their family might be portrayed. He wrote about the conversation and its aftermath in the essay [...] "Repeat After Me". Sedaris recounted that Wang was [...] "a real prince ... I didn't {{want him to be}} mad at me, but he was so grown <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I never saw how it could be turned into a movie anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bogart had {{a lifelong}} disgust for the pretentious, fake or phony. Sensitive yet caustic, {{he was once}} again disgusted by the {{inferior}} movies he was performing in. He rarely saw his own films and avoided premieres. He even issued phony press releases about his private life to satisfy the curiosity of newspapers and the public. When he thought an actor, director, or a movie studio had done something shoddy, he spoke <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and was willing to be quoted. He advised Robert Mitchum {{that the only way}} to stay alive in Hollywood was to be an [...] "againster." [...] As a result, he was not the most popular of actors, and some in the Hollywood community shunned him privately to avoid trouble with the studios. [...] But the Hollywood press, unaccustomed to candor, was delighted. Bogart once said: ...|$|E

2500|$|At the 9km {{mark and}} after a few {{attempted}} escapes, an eight man break, including team leaders David Millar and Daniele Bennati, got away, but their lead was restricted {{for a long time to}} about two minutes by the peloton. The pace was being made by the [...] "virtual" [...] leader's team Discovery and Predictor-Lotto, despite the fact that no threat to the GC was posed: Jens Voigt, 34th overall and over an hour behind Alberto Contador, was the best placed man in the break. Caisse d'Epargne made the pace in earnest for a while. It was thought at the time that they wanted to try to keep their second position in the team classification, but their directeur sportif said the next day that they simply wanted to try to win the stage. The move was extremely unpopular within the peloton, with riders like Tom Boonen and Cadel Evans speaking <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|..... We {{originally}} {{had a car}} called the Tarpon, which should have been produced ... {{it was really a}} neat car, a tight little fastback. We showed it to the S.A.E. (Society of Automotive Engineers) convention (February, 1964 in Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan) and everybody was steamed <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>it!</b> But the thing that killed the Tarpon was the fact that we didn't have a V-8 for it at that time.... Roy Abernethy didn't like little cars. Never did. He liked big cars, because he was a big guy -- hell of a nice guy. And he felt that this car was too small, so he said, [...] "Well, heck, Teague, why don't you just put it on the Rambler Classic wheel-base? That way you've got V-8 availability and you've got more room inside it." [...] And then on top of that he added an inch to the roof while I was in Europe. I still have never gotten over that..." ...|$|E
