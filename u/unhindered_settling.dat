50|$|<b>Unhindered</b> <b>settling</b> is {{a process}} that removes the {{discrete}} particles in a very low concentration without interference from nearby particles. In general, if the concentration of the solutions is lower than 500 mg/L total suspended solids, sedimentation will be considered discrete. Concentrations of raceway effluent total suspended solids (TSS) in the west are usually less than 5 mg/L net. TSS concentrations of off-line settling basin effluent are less than 100 mg/L net. The particles keep their size and shape during discrete settling, with an independent velocity. With such low concentrations of suspended particles, the probability of particle collisions is very low and consequently the rate of floculation is small enough to be neglected for most calculations. Thus the surface area of the settling basin becomes the main factor of sedimentation rate. All continuous flow settling basins are divided into four parts: inlet zone, settling zone, sludge zone and outlet zone (Figure 2).|$|E
40|$|In batchwise {{centrifugal}} casting a cylindrical mold {{is filled with}} suspension and rotated rapidly around its axis. This results in {{the movement of the}} particulate phase toward the cylinder wall and the formation of a tubular cast. Theory is presented for particle transport in the suspension phase and subsequent cast growth using concepts from the related fields of centrifugal sedimentation and centrifugal separation. Most attention is given to the situation of complete mold filling, which allows for several distinct simplifications. Analytical expressions for suspension concentration and cast growth are presented for the case of <b>unhindered</b> <b>settling.</b> Numerical simulations are made for hindered settling. The outcome shows a good agreement with experiments in which homogeneous porous ceramic membrane supports are made from a submicronsized α-alumina powder...|$|E
40|$|Settling {{properties}} of activated sludge or {{mixed liquor suspended solids}} (MLSS) {{have been studied}} for more than 75 years at wastewater treatment plants. Temperature, together with MLSS concentration, has been acknowledged as important contributors to MLSS settling variations. Batch MLSS settling tests are performed on a regular basis at most of the plants. The majority of these MLSS settling test reports reflect the complete absence of any form of temperature compensation or even MLSS sample temperature (Ts) recordings. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effects of short-term temperature variations on MLSS settling parameters. This is done by means of simplified theoretical calculations, followed by operational reactor temperature (Tr) observations, and batch MLSS settling tests. The experimental work concludes with the implementation of an on-line MLSS settling test procedure at a full-scale plant reactor to develop settling models based on diurnal Tr fluctuations. These settling models illustrate that parameter correlations improve when Tr is included in on-line MLSS concentration-based settling models. The <b>unhindered</b> <b>settling</b> velocity of a single solid biofloc in water is considered in a simplified calculation to estimate the effect of temperature variations on MLSS settling. Over a Ts increase of 20 °C, water density and viscosity reductions result in a calculated biofloc settling velocity increase of less than 0. 5 m/hr. Similarly, biofloc density, shape, and size changes result in calculated biofloc settling velocity increases of about 11, 10, and 2 m/hr respectively over the 20 °C Ts range. Plant temperature recordings show significant short- to long-term variations. Ambient temperature (Ta) and Tr fluctuate about 20 °C and 1. 8 °C respectively per day, and Tr changes by about 4 °C within a week, as measured on-line at local plants during the test period in winter. The aeration method can have a significant impact on Tr. Differences in Tr in adjacent surface and bubble aeration reactors in the same plant were about 5 °C. Large enough Tr and Ta variations exist at these local plants to affect MLSS settling test results. The MLSS settling test cylinder environment and meteorological conditions have a direct influence on Ts during batch settling tests. Direct solar radiation increases the average Ts by 4. 3 °C, or by 0. 15 °C per minute, during a 30 -minute MLSS settling test duration. This Ts change leads to a sludge volume index (SVI) change of 63 mℓ/g, at an average SVI decrease of 14. 8 mℓ/g per 1 °C Ts increase. Changes to other parameters include an initial settling velocity (ISV) increase of about 0. 12 m/hr for every 1 °C Ts increase, together with a clarified supernatant turbidity increase of about 1. 4 formazine nephelometric unit (FNU) for every 1 °C Ts increase. Ts adjusts towards Ta before and during a batch MLSS settling test, thereby influencing MLSS settling results. Compensation for Ts variations during routine MLSS settling tests is nevertheless not reported as a common practice. To some extent, this is due to a lack of temperature-controlled MLSS settling test equipment. An automated MLSS settling meter demonstrates a semi-continuous on-line method to determine settling parameters in situ at the operational Tr of a full-scale plant. A basic polynomial fits 11 MLSS settling parameters that indicate in most instances improved MLSS settling at increased Tr. The average SVI decreases by 14. 8 mℓ/g for every 1 °C Tr increase. Similarly, for every 1 °C Tr increase, the maximum settling velocity (u_max) increase is 0. 1 m/hr, and the time to reach maximum settling velocity (t_umax) decreases by 2. 4 minutes. The incremental 5 -minute duration average settling velocities increase over the first 15 minutes of a MLSS settling test, as the MLSS concentration decreases and the Tr increases. This direct incremental settling velocity trend with Tr is reversed between 15 and 30 minutes, as the average 5 -minute MLSS settling velocity increases at a reduced Tr. The inclusion of Tr in MLSS concentration-based settling best-fit correlations with SVI, u_max, and t_umax improves the coefficient of multiple determinations (R 2) by an average of 0. 32. Best-fit SVI models with u_max and t_umax have R 2 -values of 0. 90 and 0. 95 respectively. The developed models are only valid for the individual reactor MLSS conditions within the experimental parameter ranges. The main contribution of this study is to present temperature-based MLSS settling models. These models illustrate that an automated on-line MLSS settling meter is suitable to identify and model temperature related MLSS settling data with minimal experimental effort. A suitable approach is provided to improve the reliability of MLSS settling data, as effects of short-term temperature variations can be practically eliminated from settling test.

40|$|The {{settling}} behaviour of particulate suspensions {{and their}} deposits {{has been documented}} using a series of settling tube experiments. Suspensions comprised saline solution and noncohesive glass-ballotini sand of particle size 35 · 5 ?m < d < 250 ?m and volume fractions, ?s, up to 0 · 6 and cohesive kaolinite clay of particle size d < 35 · 5 ?m and volume fractions, ?m, up to 0 · 15. Five texturally distinct deposits were found, associated with different settling regimes: (I) clean, graded sand beds produced by incremental deposition under <b>unhindered</b> or hindered <b>settling</b> conditions; (II) partially graded, clean sand beds with an ungraded base and a graded top, produced by incremental deposition under hindered settling conditions; (III) graded muddy sands produced by compaction with significant particle sorting by elutriation; (IV) ungraded clean sand produced by compaction and (V) ungraded muddy sand produced by compaction. A transition from particle size segregation (regime I) to suppressed size segregation (regime II or III) to virtually no size segregation (IV or V) occurred as sediment concentration was increased. In noncohesive particulate suspensions, segregation was initially suppressed at ?s ? 0 · 2 and entirely inhibited at ?s ? 0 · 6. In noncohesive and cohesive mixtures with low sand concentrations (?s < 0 · 2), particle segregation was initially suppressed at ?m ? 0 · 07 and entirely suppressed at ?m ? 0 · 13. The experimental results {{have a number of}} implications for the depositional dynamics of submarine sediment gravity flows and other particulate flows that carry sand and mud; because the influence of moving flow is ignored in these experiments, the results will only be applicable to flows in which settling processes, in the depositional boundary, dominate over shear-flow processes, as might be the case for rapidly decelerating currents with high suspended load fallout rates. The 'abrupt' change in settling regimes between regime I and V, over a relatively small change in mud concentration (< 5 % by volume), favours the development of either mud-poor, graded sandy deposits or mud-rich, ungraded sandy deposits. This may explain the bimodality in sediment texture (clean 'turbidite' or muddy 'debrite' sand or sandstone) found in some turbidite systems. Furthermore, it supports the notion that distal 'linked' debrites could form because of a relatively small increase in the mud concentration of turbidity currents, perhaps associated with erosion of a muddy sea floor. Ungraded, clean sand deposits were formed by noncohesive suspensions with concentrations 0 · 2 ? ?s ? 0 · 4. Hydrodynamic sorting is interpreted as being suppressed in this case by relatively high bed aggradation rates which could also occur in association with sustained, stratified turbidity currents or noncohesive debris flows with relatively high near-bed sediment concentrations. <br/...|$|R
