5|$|Tolkien based Quenya {{pronunciation}} more on Latin than on Finnish. Thus, Quenya {{lacks the}} vowel harmony and consonant gradation present in Finnish, and accent {{is not always}} on the first syllable of a word. Typical Finnish elements like the front vowels ö, ä and y are lacking in Quenya, but phonological similarities include the absence of aspirated <b>unvoiced</b> stops or {{the development of the}} syllables ti > si in both languages. The combination of a Latin basis with Finnish phonological rules resulted in a product that resembles Italian in many respects, which was Tolkien's favourite modern Romance language.|$|E
5|$|A port of {{the game}} for the PlayStation 3 was {{announced}} in April 2009. The port features full voice acting, containing nearly twice as much voice work as the original voice script, which covers previously <b>unvoiced</b> cutscenes in the 360 version. The game also features various new characters, has Flynn as a permanent playable character, and adds a new playable character {{in the form of}} Patty Fleur. Development on the port began in 2008, after the release of the original version. Speaking on why the port was being developed, a developer who worked on Vampire Rain said that companies like Namco Bandai first developed for the Xbox 360 due to superior funding and development support when compared to Sony, then ported to PS3 with minimal effort so they could recoup development costs and add features that needed to be cut from the original game.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Valkyira Chronicles games, Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role-playing game where players {{take control of}} a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces. Stories are told through comic book-like panels with animated character portraits, with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through <b>unvoiced</b> text. The player progresses {{through a series of}} linear missions, gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked. The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player's approach: when one option is selected, the other is sealed off to the player. Outside missions, the player characters rest in a camp, where units can be customized and character growth occurs. Alongside the main story missions are character-specific sub missions relating to different squad members. After the game's completion, additional episodes are unlocked, some of them having a higher difficulty than those found {{in the rest of the}} game. There are also love simulation elements related to the game's two main heroines, although they take a very minor role.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characters}} {{include the}} {{various members of}} the Kingsglaive and Regis' council: Banjō Ginga (JP) /John DeMita (EN) as Clarus Amicitia, father to main character Gladiolus; Wataru Takagi (JP) /Ben Diskin (EN) as Pelna Khara; and Fuminori Komatsu (JP) /Max Mittelman (EN) as Tredd Furia. <b>Unvoiced</b> characters include Kingsglaive members Sonitus Bellum and Axis Arra. While both English and Japanese voicetracks were produced, lip syncing for all versions was matched to the English voice work. The lead voice actors, such as Paul, were chosen so they would be recognized and appeal to a wide audience, in addition to their acting abilities. The Japanese voice casting followed a similar model, choosing well-known actors for the lead roles. Casting was handled by Rui Kawada, who also acted as general project manager. The compartmentalization of the development meant that the characters were mostly voiced by different actors to Final Fantasy XV. Originally there were plans for both the movie and game voice cast to cross over, but these were scrapped.|$|E

25|$|In unified {{international}} braille, {{the braille}} pattern dots-14 {{is used to}} represent <b>unvoiced</b> palatal fricatives or <b>unvoiced</b> alveolar affricates, such as /ts/, or /ç/, and is otherwise assigned as needed. It {{is also used to}} indicate the number 3.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unvoiced</b> {{stops and}} affricates are {{pronounced}} preaspirated after vowels and sonorant consonants.|$|E
25|$|Ot is {{pronounced}} os (with <b>unvoiced</b> s) in the Ashkenazi dialect.|$|E
25|$|In unified {{international}} braille, {{the braille}} pattern dots-13 {{is used to}} represent an <b>unvoiced</b> velar plosive, ie /k/.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that unlike}} their typical {{interpretation}} in modern English language, bh and gh are voiced and unaspirated, whereas b, g, and d are plain <b>unvoiced</b> as in Hanyu Pinyin. p, k, and t are <b>unvoiced</b> and aspirated, corresponding closer to p, t, and k in English. It {{is inconsistent with}} the use of h's in the Legge romanization {{and the use of the}} diacritic in the International Phonetic Alphabet to signal consonantal aspiration.|$|E
25|$|Icelandic {{has very}} minor dialectal {{differences}} phonetically. The language has both monophthongs and diphthongs, and consonants can be voiced or <b>unvoiced.</b>|$|E
25|$|In unified {{international}} braille, {{the braille}} pattern dots-16 {{is used to}} represent the <b>unvoiced</b> alveolar or palatal affricate, such as /tʃ/ or /tɕ/, or otherwise as needed.|$|E

25|$|Another {{alternation}} involves transitive verbs with an <b>unvoiced</b> {{initial and}} passive or stative verbs with a voiced initial, though scholars are divided on which form is basic.|$|E
25|$|In unified {{international}} braille, {{the braille}} pattern dots-124 {{is used to}} represent <b>unvoiced</b> labial fricatives, such as /f/ and /ɸ/, and is otherwise assigned as needed. It is also used for the number 6.|$|E
25|$|In unified {{international}} braille, {{the braille}} pattern dots-46 {{is used to}} represent an <b>unvoiced</b> dorsal plosive, such as /k/ or /q/ when multiple letters correspond to these values, and is otherwise assigned as needed.|$|E
25|$|If {{the word}} form is monosyllabic and {{ends in a}} consonant, a non-phonemic weakly voiced or <b>unvoiced</b> vowel is {{pronounced}} after the final consonant. This vowel is e-colored if suprasegmental palatalization is present, but a-colored if not.|$|E
25|$|The inverse {{relationship}} between consonant gradation and medial lenition of stops (the pattern also continuing within the three families where gradation is found) is noted by Helimski (1995): an original allophonic gradation system between voiceless and voiced stops would have been easily disrupted by a spreading of voicing to previously <b>unvoiced</b> stops as well.|$|E
25|$|The letters В, Ё (since 1957), Ф, Х, Ц, Ч, Щ, Ъ, Ь and Э are {{not used}} in native Kazakh words. Of these, Ё, Ц, Ч, Щ, Ъ, Ь, Э, are used only in words {{borrowed}} from Russian or through the Russian language which are written according to Russian orthographic rules. The letter Х in conversational speech is pronounced similar to Қ. The letter Һ is used only in Arabic-Persian borrowings and is often pronounced like an <b>unvoiced</b> Х (as , or a voiceless glottal fricative).|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequent}} disagreement {{of the letter}} reversals has been over the Haha–Hung pair. The most convincing evidence suggesting this reversal is {{in the names of}} the letters: The <b>unvoiced</b> letter Haha is deep, while the voiced Hung, which suggests a lower position, is tall. This is often assumed to be a clerical error introduced in the rushed printing of the Shavian edition of Androcles and the Lion. This reversal obscures the system of tall letters as voiceless consonants and deep letters as voiced consonants.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, many {{researchers}} {{have come to believe}} that one variant of the northeastern Iberian script, the older one according to the archaeological contexts, distinguished voicing in the plosives by adding a stroke to the glyphs for the alveolar (/d/~/t/) and velar (/g/~/k/) syllables, creating distinct glyphs for <b>unvoiced</b> /t/ and /k/, and restricting the original glyphs to voiced /d/ and /g/. (This is the so-called dual signary model: see northeastern Iberian script.) If correct, this innovation would parallel the creation of the Latin letter G by the addition of a stroke to C, which had previously stood for both /k/ and /g/.|$|E
25|$|The {{layout of}} the gojūon table {{promotes}} a systematic view of kana syllabograms as being always pronounced with the same single consonant followed by a vowel, {{but this is not}} exactly the case (and never has been). Existing schemes for the romanization of Japanese either are based on the systematic nature of the script, e.g. nihon-siki チ ti, or they apply some Western graphotactics, usually the English one, to the common Japanese pronunciation of the kana signs, e.g. Hepburn-shiki チ chi. Both approaches conceal the fact, though, that many consonant-based katakana signs, especially those canonically ending in u, can be used in coda position, too, where the vowel is <b>unvoiced</b> and therefore barely perceptible.|$|E
25|$|A very {{important}} issue for all neuroscientific or neurocomputational approaches is to separate structure and knowledge. While {{the structure of the}} model (i.e. of the human neuronal network, which is needed for processing speech) is mainly determined by evolutionary processes, the knowledge is gathered mainly during speech acquisition by processes of learning. Different learning experiments were carried out with the model ACT in order to learn (i) a five-vowel system /i, e, a, o, u/ (see Kröger et al. 2009), (ii) a small consonant system (voiced plosives /b, d, g/ in combination with all five vowels acquired earlier as CV syllables (ibid.), (iii) a small model language comprising the five-vowel system, voiced and <b>unvoiced</b> plosives /b, d, g, p, t, k/, nasals /m, n/ and the lateral /l/ and three syllable types (V, CV, and CCV) (see Kröger et al. 2011) and (iv) the 200 most frequent syllables of Standard German for a 6 year old child (see Kröger et al. 2011). In all cases, an ordering of phonetic items with respect to different phonetic features can be observed.|$|E

According to Tolkien, the graphs [...] or [...] is pronounced as [...] "a lip-rounded 'k' {{followed by a}} partly <b>unvoiced</b> w-offglide", that is [...]|$|E
500|$|Consonants {{are those}} sounds that have audible {{friction}} or closure {{at some point}} within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, palate, velum, uvula, or glottis. Each place of articulation produces {{a different set of}} consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by manner of articulation, or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called occlusive or stop, or different degrees of aperture creating fricatives and approximants. Consonants can also be either voiced or <b>unvoiced,</b> depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English [...] in bus (<b>unvoiced</b> sibilant) from [...] in buzz (voiced sibilant).|$|E
500|$|There is a {{predictable}} non-phonemic vowel inserted into consonant clusters, realized as [...] before front consonants (e.g. [...] ) and [...] before back consonants (e.g[...] It is voiced before voiced consonants and voiceless before voiceless consonants, or alternatively {{it can be}} realized as a voiced or <b>unvoiced</b> consonant release. It also may be realized as the syllabicity of a nasal, lateral, or /r/.|$|E
500|$|Tamil {{phonology}} is characterised by {{the presence}} of retroflex consonants and multiple rhotics. [...] Tamil does not distinguish phonologically between voiced and <b>unvoiced</b> consonants; phonetically, voice is assigned depending on a consonant's position in a word. Tamil phonology permits few consonant clusters, which can never be word initial. Native grammarians classify Tamil phonemes into vowels, consonants, and a [...] "secondary character", the āytam.|$|E
500|$|Tamil consonants are {{presented}} as hard, soft and medial in some grammars which roughly corresponds to plosives, nasals and approximants. Unlike most Indian languages, Tamil does not distinguish aspirated and unaspirated consonants. In addition, the voicing of plosives is governed by strict rules in [...] Plosives are <b>unvoiced</b> if they occur word-initially or doubled. Elsewhere they are voiced, with a few becoming fricatives , which means that voicing is not a phonological trait for plosives. Nasals and approximants are always voiced.|$|E
500|$|Musical tones {{produced}} by the human voice and all acoustical musical instruments incorporate noises in varying degrees. Most consonants in human speech (e.g., the sounds of f, v, s, z, both voiced and <b>unvoiced</b> th, Scottish and German ch) are characterised by distinctive noises, and even vowels are not entirely noise free. Wind instruments include the whizzing or hissing sounds of air breaking against {{the edges of the}} mouthpiece, while bowed instruments produce audible rubbing noises that contribute, when the instrument is poor or the player unskilful, to what is perceived as a poor tone. When they are not excessive, listeners [...] "make themselves deaf" [...] to these noises by ignoring them.|$|E
500|$|Some dialects {{have fewer}} or more {{consonant}} phonemes and phones {{than the standard}} varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a voiceless [...] sound in whine that contrasts with the voiced [...] in wine, but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced , a dialect feature called wine–whine merger. The <b>unvoiced</b> velar fricative sound [...] is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes loch [...] from lock [...] Accents like Cockney with [...] "h-dropping" [...] lack the glottal fricative , and dialects with th-stopping and th-fronting like African American Vernacular and Estuary English {{do not have the}} dental fricatives , but replace them with dental or alveolar stops [...] or labiodental fricatives [...] Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as yod-dropping, yod-coalescence, and reduction of consonant clusters.|$|E
500|$|In September 2012, Square Enix {{announced}} Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix {{for release}} in Japan on the PlayStation 3. The collection would include both Kingdom Hearts Final Mix and [...] in high definition and trophy support, {{as well as}} non-playable HD event scenes from Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days {{as a way for}} players to understand the story. The development team experimented with using some character models from [...] for HD 1.5 Remix. The cutscenes from Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, which were either <b>unvoiced</b> or used English voice acting, now use the original Japanese voice acting in the Japanese release; the voice acting remains unchanged in the English-language releases. 358/2 Days was originally planned to receive a full remake for the compilation similar to Re:Chain of Memories, but due to the lengthy development time it would require, it was instead presented as an extended HD cinematic retelling the game's events. Every cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, whether it was originally a pre-rendered scene or used in-game graphics, was re-animated for the cinematic.|$|E
500|$|After Tamil Brahmi {{fell out}} of use, Tamil was written using a script called the [...] amongst others such as Grantha and Pallava script. The current Tamil script {{consists}} of 12 vowels, 18 consonants and one special character, the āytam. [...] The vowels and consonants combine to form 216 compound characters, giving a total of 247 characters (12 + 18 + 1 + (12 x 18)). All consonants have an inherent vowel a, as with other Indic scripts. This inherent vowel is removed by adding a tittle called a , to the consonantal sign. For example, [...] is ṉa (with the inherent a) and [...] is ṉ (without a vowel). Many Indic scripts have a similar sign, generically called virama, but the Tamil script is somewhat different in that it nearly always uses a visible puḷḷi to indicate a dead consonant (a consonant without a vowel). In other Indic scripts, it is generally preferred to use a ligature or a half form to write a syllable or a cluster containing a dead consonant, although writing it with a visible virama is also possible. The Tamil script does not differentiate voiced and <b>unvoiced</b> plosives. [...] Instead, plosives are articulated with voice depending on their position in a word, {{in accordance with the}} rules of Tamil phonology.|$|E
500|$|Released on June 25, 1999 for the PlayStation in Japan, Metal Gear Solid: Integral is an {{expanded}} {{edition of the}} game that features the added content from the American and European versions. It replaces the Japanese voices from the original version with the English dub, offering players a choice between Japanese and English subtitles during cutscenes and CODEC conversations (item descriptions, mission logs and other text are still in Japanese). Further additional content to the main game include an alternate [...] "sneaking suit" [...] outfit for Meryl (which she wears when Snake is dressed in the tuxedo), a [...] "Very Easy" [...] difficulty setting where the player starts the mission armed with a suppressor-equipped MP5 sub-machine gun with infinite ammo (substituting the FAMAS rifle in Snake's inventory), an eighth Codec frequency featuring written staff commentary (<b>unvoiced</b> and in Japanese only) on every area and boss encounter, hidden music tracks, an alternate game mode where the player controls Snake from a first-person perspective (on Normal difficulty only), an option for alternate patrol routes for enemies, and a downloadable PocketStation minigame. The Torture Event was also made easier on higher difficulty levels, {{reducing the number of}} rounds to three per session in all settings.|$|E
500|$|Sounds {{as part of}} a {{linguistic}} system are called phonemes. Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called minimal pair. In English, for example, the words bat [...] and pat [...] form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between [...] and [...] differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and <b>unvoiced</b> consonants, the sounds [...] and [...] (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between aspirated and non-aspirated pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like Korean and Hindi do: the unaspirated [...] in spin [...] and the aspirated [...] in pin [...] are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called allophones), whereas in Mandarin Chinese, the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words [...] 'crouch' and [...] 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).|$|E
