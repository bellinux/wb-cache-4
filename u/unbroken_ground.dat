(Gaping Gill on Ingleborough falls {{a greater}} unbroken distance into a pothole, and Hardraw Force {{has a greater}} <b>unbroken</b> fall above <b>ground).</b> The broken cascade of falls tumbles a total of 650 feet (198 m) down a cliff face {{at the head of}} a wild and bleak glacial valley that comes down from a high plateau called The Calf. It is located in the Howgill Fells, traditionally in the West Riding of Yorkshire but now in Cumbria on the western edge of the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The waterfall is just north of the small town of Sedbergh. This fall is one of the few cascade falls in England; most are either tiered or plunge falls.|$|R

Simply described, the chariot {{has been around}} for centuries in the near East not only showing the owners status in societies but also in times of war. This became the most predominate in the time of the 16th century when the chariot was introduced to the Egyptians during a war with the Hyksos army (Shulman). The chariot aided in many battles, they could be used in a multitude of ways from, a glorified product mover or transportation for soldiers to be moved to and from the battle fields in a ‘battle taxi’ type manor {{and a variety of other}} ways (Archer 2). A weapon that accompanied the soldiers and their passengers were objects such as the composite bows, arrows and a variety of other object such as spears and swords. The role of an archer was one of value when place on the back of a chariot, literally making this a target almost unable to hit due to the amount of movement. ‘Chariots were used to ferry bowmen to suitable firing positions, where they dismounted and fired their bows on foot, climbing back into their chariots and speeding away when threatened’ (Archer 6). One major usage of the chariot was to ram into the front lines of the enemy to scare them into breaking formation, giving the opp. using army the opportunity to get behind their lines and start fighting. Due to the fact that war horses, although trained, still became scared. ‘Horses will not willingly charge into massed ranks of infantry, always preferring to pull up and stop just short of their lines regardless of the intentions of the riders and handlers’ (Archer 4).  Even if the horse drawn chariot did follow through and attempt to break the enemy’s lines would have been a terrible idea if they were using the lighter Bronze Age type war chariots. The chariots proved themselves most useful on flat <b>unbroken</b> <b>ground,</b> this is where their speed and maneuvering capabilities were at their height. This did how ever become a thorn in the side of Egyptians during the eighth and ninth centuries when the battle between Egypt and Syria, Palestine Empire broke out, causing the Egyptian chariots to become virtually incapable of performing its intended duties due to the very nature of the landscape; mountainous and rocky. There are many theories as to how chariots aided in the raise and fall of Egypt, the most prominent of these was created by Robert Drews. He claims that chariots were responsible for the end of the Late Bronze Age. His claim is that the mercenaries in the area at this time spent a great amount of effort and time watching and learning the strength and weaknesses of the warfare styles of the Egyptian military to aid in the future rebellions they would hold to overthrow the government.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} a lattice fermion model in one dimension with explicit N= 1 supersymmetry (SUSY). The Hamiltonian {{of the model}} {{is defined by the}} square of a supercharge built from Majorana fermion operators. The model describes interacting Majorana fermions and its properties depend only on a single parameter g. When g= 1, we find that SUSY is <b>unbroken</b> and the <b>ground</b> states are identical to those of the frustration-free Kitaev chains. We also find a parameter regime in which SUSY is restored in the infinite volume limit. For sufficiently large g, we prove that SUSY is spontaneously broken and the low-lying excitations are gapless, which {{can be thought of as}} Nambu-Goldstone fermions. We then show numerically that these gapless modes have cubic dispersion at long wavelength. Comment: 5 + 8 pages, 5 + 1 figure...|$|R
6000|$|Hence {{it might}} {{at first sight}} appear, that an idea of imitation, inasmuch as several ideas of truth were united in it, was nobler than a simple idea of truth. And if it were {{necessary}} that the ideas of truth should be perfect, or should be subjects of contemplation as such, it would be so. But, observe, we require to produce the effect of imitation only so many and such ideas of truth as the senses are usually cognizant of. Now the senses are not usually, nor unless they be especially devoted to the service, cognizant, with accuracy, of any truths but those of space and projection. It requires long study and attention before they give certain evidence of even the simplest truths of form. For instance, the quay on which the figure is sitting, with his hand at his eyes, in Claude's seaport, No. 14, in the National Gallery, is egregiously out of perspective. The eye of this artist, with all his study, had thus not acquired the power of taking cognizance of the apparent form even of a simple parallelopiped. How much less of the complicated forms of boughs, leaves, or limbs? Although, therefore, something resembling the real form is necessary to deception, this something {{is not to be}} called a truth of form; for, strictly speaking, there are no degrees of truth, there are only degrees of approach to it; and an approach to it, whose feebleness and imperfection would instantly offend and give pain to a mind really capable of distinguishing truth, is yet quite sufficient for all the purposes of deceptive imagination. It is the same with regard to color. If we were to paint a tree sky-blue, or a dog rose-pink, the discernment of the public would be keen enough to discover the falsehood; but, so that there be just so much approach to truth of color as may come up to the common idea of it in men's minds, that is to say, if the trees be all bright green, and flesh <b>unbroken</b> buff, and <b>ground</b> <b>unbroken</b> brown, though all the real and refined truths of color be wholly omitted, or rather defied and contradicted, there is yet quite enough for all purposes of imitation. The only facts then, which we are usually and certainly cognizant of, are those of distance and projection, and if these be tolerably given, with something like truth of form and color to assist them, the idea of imitation is complete. I would undertake to paint an arm, with every muscle out of its place, and every bone of false form and dislocated articulation, and yet to observe certain coarse and broad resemblances of true outline, which, with careful shading, would induce deception, and draw down the praise and delight of the discerning public. The other day at Bruges, while I was endeavoring to set down in my note-book something of the ineffable expression of the Madonna in the cathedral, a French amateur came up to me, to inquire if I had seen the modern French pictures in a neighboring church. I had not, but felt little inclined to leave my marble for all the canvas that ever suffered from French brushes. My apathy was attacked with gradually increasing energy of praise. Rubens never executed--Titian never colored anything like them. I thought this highly probable, and still sat quiet. The voice continued at my ear. [...] "Parbleu, Monsieur, Michel Ange n'a rien produit de plus beau!" [...] "De plus beau?" [...] repeated I, wishing to know what particular excellences of Michael Angelo were to be intimated by this expression. [...] "Monsieur, on ne pent plus--c'est un tableau admirable--inconcevable: Monsieur," [...] said the Frenchman, lifting up his hands to heaven, as he concentrated in one conclusive and overwhelming proposition the qualities which were to outshine Rubens and overpower Buonaroti--"Monsieur, IL SORT!" ...|$|R

40|$|We discuss an O(N) exension of the Sine-Gordon (S-G) {{equation}} {{which allows}} us to perform an expansion around the leading order in large-N result using Path-Integral methods. In leading order we show our methods agree {{with the results of}} a variational calculation at large-N. We discuss the striking differences for a non-polynomial interaction between the form for the effective potential in the Gaussian approximation that one obtains at large-N when compared to the N= 1 case. This is in contrast to the case when the classical potential is a polynomial in the field and no such drastic differences occur. We find for our large-N extension of the Sine-Gordon model that the <b>unbroken</b> <b>ground</b> state is unstable as one increases the coupling constant (as it is for the original S-G equation) and we determine the stability criteria.

40|$|In the {{mountains}} of north Croatia in thermophil oak wood grows a really nice blue-violet iris, which was considered as Iris germánica, which extended from the gardens to the natural habitats. But, with more carefully observation it was showed, that this plant from natural habitats is very much different from Iris germánica in consideration of stem’s ramification, of leafs length, and especially of more inflated spathes and of many characteristics in constitution and colour of flowers. This iris belongs to the new species from affinity Iris aphylla, so this species is described as Iris croatica, and we bring the description, the differences toward the congenial species, it variability and the distribution. The Latin diagnose with its essential characteristics {{is included in the}} Croatian text. Iris croatica distinguishes from many other subspecies and forms of I. aphylla s. 1. in the first way in the greatness of all parts of the plant, then with the number of flowers on the branches and with short, oval and very inflated spathes. The new iris shows many differences on the same locality depending if this plant has grown on the shallow stony soil, on the uncovered locality or on deeper soil in the scrub or in the bright small wood. This differences are phenotypical. But, this species is different also on the single localities, which include isolated populations with really expressive genotypic speciality. Based on this specialities we can distinguish several forms, but we must still determine if they are not the systematic unities of higher category. The Iris croatica is morphologically narrowly related to Iris aphylla. The same number of chromosoms, the morphology and geographical distribution shows their same origin. Iris aphylla is distributed from the Middle Europe on the west, along the north and southern margin of Carpathians and Pannonian basin, till Ukraine and Caucasus, from where reaches in Asia minor. New species of I. croatica on the contrary inhabits separated area in the north-western part of Croatia, and makes with the area of I. aphylla encircled <b>unbroken</b> <b>ground</b> of panonnian-pontic distribution. Iris croatica is developed in relict centar of tertiary vegetation, and in morphological view unites some characteristics of other forms of species I. aphylla, so we can it consider like probable origin of the whole group...|$|E
