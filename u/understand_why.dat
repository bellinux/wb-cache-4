5|$|Charlie {{has barely}} made it into his new flat in London when his father dies suddenly. Charlie hurries home for the funeral, where he finds the factory near bankruptcy. The factory makes good quality men's shoes, {{but they are not}} stylish and not cheap, and the market for them is drying up. Charlie is {{determined}} to save the factory and his father's legacy, though he has no desire to run Price & Sons himself. The workers, many of whom have known Charlie his entire life, do not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> Charlie had moved away in the first place, and many are hostile and skeptical of the new management.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commentary}} for the episode, Anderson elaborated on Scully and Waterston's original backstory: after Scully and Waterston {{came close to}} having an affair, Scully left to study at Quantico to become an FBI agent. After she left, Waterston become depressed, and his family began to suspect the affair. The emotional turmoil {{was too much for}} Waterston's wife, who killed herself, which made Waterston's daughter, Maggie, resent Scully, as shown in the finished episode. Anderson felt that the removal of this backstory made it hard for the audience to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> Maggie was so angry at Scully.|$|E

5|$|When the live-action of the manga was made, Watsuki {{had several}} ideas about Kenshin's mind about his early {{appearances}} in the series. This resulted in the manga reboot Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration where Kenshin's characterization was expanded by the author who thought in retrospective about what he could add to him. Although there were some changes to the cast, Watsuki {{wanted them to be}} subtle such as Kenshin wearing a scarf. He also wrote a prequel chapter to the original series which helped the readers to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> Kenshin would stay in Kaoru's dojo.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Tahna orders Kira {{at gunpoint}} {{to return to}} the station, {{intending}} to collapse the wormhole with an explosive device, because then Bajor will have no motivation to invite Federation presence on Bajoran territory, which he sees as a new occupation. Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to fall over and allowing her to pilot the ship through the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> this {{was the right thing to}} do someday.|$|E

5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E
5|$|During the afternoon's {{practice}} session on Friday, June 17, 2005, Ralf Schumacher, driving for Toyota, crashed badly in Turn 13 of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course, apparently {{as a result}} of a left-rear tyre failure. He was unable to continue racing, and was replaced by the team's test driver, Ricardo Zonta, for the rest of the weekend. Schumacher had crashed in the same spot {{as a result of}} a tyre failure the previous year, while driving for the Williams team. Turn 13 on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course is a high speed banked turn, unique in Formula One racing, which causes a greater than usual tyre loading. On June 18, Michelin reported that it did not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> the tyres it had provided for its seven customer teams– BAR, McLaren, Red Bull, Renault, Sauber, Toyota, and Williams– had failed in this turn, and announced its intention to fly in tyres of a different specification from its Clermont-Ferrand headquarters. Unfortunately, the replacement tyres flown in, which were of the type used in the Spanish Grand Prix earlier that year, turned out to have the same problem when tested.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E

5|$|Milk {{abruptly}} {{stopped working}} as an insurance actuary and became {{a researcher at the}} Wall Street firm Bache & Company. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to offend the older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work. He started a romantic relationship with Jack Galen McKinley, and recruited him to work on conservative Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. Their relationship was troubled. When McKinley first began his relationship with Milk in late 1964, he was 16 years old. He was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him enough attention. To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt, after his lover Billy Sipple left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the avant-garde art scene in Greenwich Village, but Milk did not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> Campbell's despondency was sufficient cause to consider suicide as an option.|$|E
5|$|Nick calls Norah, {{apologizing for}} leaving, and she agrees {{to meet him}} again. Deciding to go somewhere where no one they know will find them, they arrive at Electric Lady Studios, a music studio owned by Norah's father. Once there, Norah gets Nick to play {{something}} {{he wrote in the}} studio, but then joins him in the recording room. Norah gets a text message from Caroline telling her where she found Where's Fluffy? playing. When they arrive at the show, they meet Tris, who cannot <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> Nick will not take her back, and Tal, who wants the same answer from Norah. Tal starts a fight with Nick, but Thom and Dev's friend, Lethario (Jonathan B. Wright), steps in and headbutts Tal. Nick and Norah share a smile and leave together. At Pennsylvania Station, Nick admits that he does not care about missing the concert, and they kiss on the escalator as the sun rises over New York City.|$|E
5|$|No single motive or {{pattern has}} emerged through the {{thousands}} of pages of evidence gathered. The selection of works puzzles the experts, specifically since more valuable artworks were available. The FBI's lead agent assigned to the case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished. On their way to the finial, the thieves passed by two Raphaels and a Botticelli painting. Titian's The Rape of Europa, {{which is one of the}} museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen. Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the painting from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches, investigators believe the thieves were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works. Some investigators believe the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared. Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the Irish Republican Army in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states Whitey Bulger was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.|$|E

5|$|One of the Wattle Birds, Anderson's {{seventh and}} final novel, was {{published}} in 1994. Set in Sydney, it details three days {{in the life of}} Cecily Ambruss. Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present, the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three-day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means of coping with the fact that a year earlier, her mother, Christine had died of breast cancer, while Cecily had been away on holiday. Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> her mother did not tell her about that fatal illness and let her go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit. In addition to its adept depiction of the intricacies of social and family life, One of the Wattle Birds speaks to the process of writing and creating, as Cecily is herself a writer.|$|E
5|$|The Shangani Patrol {{continued}} its approach {{during the late}} evening, and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula. Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves. The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> {{there appeared to be}} so few Company soldiers, nor why they would reveal their position like this. They concluded that it must be a trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times. Following the fifth call from Napier, Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending to pocket it. Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak. When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them.|$|E
5|$|To <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> the Chinese {{made such}} reports, Waley {{explained}} that any military action, whether successful or not, {{was followed by}} a scramble to get mentioned in the official report to the throne as an incentive for receiving a decoration, promotion, or other reward. The number of alleged casualties inflicted on the enemy was often based on what officers thought would entitle them to the reward they had in mind. Although Lin forwarded Lai's concocted reports to the Daoguang Emperor, Waley noted that it is unclear to what extent, if any, that Lin was aware of the fabrications, especially since he was regarded as a man of unusually high integrity by the British and Chinese. This was {{the first in a series}} of reports in which the emperor became aware in 1841 that the Canton authorities had been systematically deceiving him about events during the war. The emperor ordered the Governor of Guangxi, Liang Chang-chü, to send him clear accounts of the events at Canton, noting that since Guangxi was a neighbouring province, Liang must be receiving independent accounts. He warned Liang that he would be able to verify his information by secret inquiries from other places.|$|E
