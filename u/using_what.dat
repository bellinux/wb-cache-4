5|$|Things did {{not stay}} {{peaceful}} for long. On December 17, 1931, Charles Nelson shot partner John Dykas in the back, killing him. Trapper Nelson, angered by his step-brother's actions, testified against {{him at the}} trial for Dykas' murder. Charles was given a 20-year sentence at Raiford Prison. Disillusioned with civilization, Nelson withdrew from the beach, settling deep in the woods on the Loxahatchee River that same December. <b>Using</b> <b>what</b> little money he had and money borrowed from his sister, he bought 800acres.|$|E
5|$|After Monica Dawson (Dana Davis) is {{captured}} by a street gang, Micah Sanders (Noah Gray-Cabey) {{turns to his}} mother Niki (Ali Larter) for help. Despite the fact that Niki no longer has her powers due to the virus, she agrees to help. They follow a GPS signal emitted by Monica's cell phone and find her in an abandoned warehouse. She is tied up and the warehouse is burning around her. <b>Using</b> <b>what</b> remains of her superhuman strength, Niki manages to help Monica escape, but her strength eventually fails and she ends up trapped inside the building as it explodes.|$|E
5|$|The Dresden meeting {{revealed}} that Austria's influence in Europe had reached its lowest point, and Metternich was now bent on re-establishing that influence by <b>using</b> <b>what</b> he considered strong ties with all {{sides in the}} war, proposing general peace talks headed by Austria. Over the next three months, he would slowly distance Austria from the French cause, while avoiding alliance with either Prussia or Russia, and remaining open to any proposal that would secure {{a place for the}} combined Bonaparte-Habsburg dynasty. This was driven by concern that if Napoleon were defeated, Russia and Prussia would stand to gain too much. Napoleon was intransigent, however, and the fighting (now officially the War of the Sixth Coalition) continued. Austria's alliance with France ended in February 1813, and Austria then moved to a position of armed neutrality.|$|E

5|$|The banker Charles Rothschild devoted much of {{his time}} to entomology, {{creating}} a large collection of fleas now in the Rothschild Collection at the Natural History Museum, London. He discovered and named the plague vector flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, also known as the oriental rat flea, in 1903. <b>Using</b> <b>what</b> was probably the world's most complete collection of fleas of about 260,000 specimens (representing some 73% of the 2,587 species and subspecies so far described), he described around 500 species and subspecies of Siphonaptera. He was followed in this interest by his daughter Miriam Rothschild, who helped to catalogue his enormous collection of the insects in seven volumes.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{has been}} adapted to film twice, on both {{occasions}} by writer-director Stephen Weeks: first as Gawain and the Green Knight in 1973 {{and again in}} 1984 as , featuring Miles O'Keeffe as Gawain and Sean Connery as the Green Knight. Both films have been criticised for deviating from the poem's plot. Also, Bertilak and the Green Knight are never connected. French/Australian director Martin Beilby directed a short (30') film adaptation in 2014. There {{have been at least}} two television adaptations, Gawain and the Green Knight in 1991 and the animated Sir Gawain and the Green Knight in 2002.

5|$|To help {{combat the}} {{negative}} press, Aberhart resolved {{to gain control}} of the Albertan, the one paper of note to show him any support. He formed a company that acquired an option to purchase it, and used his radio program to promote the purchase of shares by Social Credit supporters. The other newspapers criticized him for <b>using</b> <b>what</b> was nominally a gospel program to promote stock sales. The plan came to naught, as most Social Credit supporters were too poor to buy newspaper stock, and the only interested buyers were beneficiaries of government patronage, chiefly liquor interests. Even so, the Albertan became the official organ of Social Credit, an editorial decision that doubled its circulation.|$|E

From Weedsport to Jordan, NY31 used {{a slightly different}} routing. It initially exited the village on Clinton Road and followed that road to Jordan, where NY31 turned north and followed modern NY317 and NY31 north and east to modern CR84. NY31 turned north here, <b>using</b> <b>what</b> is now Old Route31, current NY31, and Downer Street to reach Baldwinsville. Within the village, NY31 followed Downer Street and what is now NY48 along Syracuse Street between Downer and Genesee Streets. Outside of Baldwinsville, NY31 remained on its current routing to Cicero, where it followed a more northerly alignment along Lakeshore Road. It rejoined its modern alignment near the eastern town line, and followed it east {{to what is now}} NY316 in Lenox. From here, NY31 went southeastward to NY5 in Oneida by way of modern NY316 and NY46.|$|E
