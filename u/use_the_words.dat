5|$|Kings did {{not rule}} alone, but rather governed {{together}} with the leading churchmen and nobles. While Northumbria lacks the body of charters which {{shed light on the}} institutions of the southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, sufficient evidence survives for historians to reconstruct some aspects of Northumbrian political life. The evidence for Northumbria survives largely in Latin documents, and these <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> dux and patricius to describe the leading noblemen of the kingdom. The word dux is usually translated by the Old English word ealdorman. The historian Alan Thacker estimates that there were about eight men holding the title of dux in late Northumbria. The title patricius is usually translated as patrician, which ultimately means noble, but in the latter days of the Roman Empire represented a high-ranking position, second only to the emperor. The meaning of the title in Northumbria is unclear, but it appears that there was only one patricius. While it may be simply an alternative to dux, it might represent a position approximating to that of the Mayor of the Palace in late Merovingian Francia.|$|E

25|$|Sikhs {{generally}} <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> Singh ("lion") and Kaur ("princess") as surnames {{added to}} the otherwise unisex first names of men and women, respectively. It is also common to use a different surname after Singh in which case Singh or Kaur are used as middle names (Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Surinder Kaur Badal). The tenth Guru of Sikhism ordered (Hukamnama) that any man who considered himself a Sikh must use Singh in his name and any woman who considered herself a Sikh must use Kaur in her name. Other middle names or honorifics that are sometimes used as surnames include Kumar, Dev, Lal, and Chand.|$|E
25|$|It {{was in the}} mid-17th {{century that}} another major {{contributor}} {{to the field of}} neuropsychology emerged. Thomas Willis studied at Oxford University and took a physiological approach to the brain and behavior. It was Willis who coined the words 'hemisphere' and 'lobe' when referring to the brain. He was one of the earliest to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> 'neurology' and 'psychology'. Rejecting the idea that humans were the only beings capable of rational thought, Willis looked at specialized structures of the brain. He theorized that higher structures accounted for complex functions, whereas lower structures were responsible for functions similar to those seen in other animals, consisting mostly of reactions and automatic responses. He was particularly interested in people who suffered from manic disorders and hysteria. His research constituted some of the first times that psychiatry and neurology came together to study individuals. Through his in-depth study of the brain and behavior, Willis concluded that automated responses such as breathing, heartbeats and other various motor activities were carried out within the lower region of the brain. Although much of his work has been made obsolete, his ideas presented the brain as more complex than previously imagined, and led the way for future pioneers to understand and build upon his theories, especially when it came to looking at disorders and dysfunctions of the brain.|$|E
500|$|The formal {{titles of}} the {{currency}} are euro for the major unit and cent for the minor (one hundredth) unit and for official use in most eurozone languages; according to the ECB, all languages should use the same spelling for the nominative singular. This may contradict normal rules for word formation in some languages, e.g., those {{where there is no}} eu diphthong. Bulgaria has negotiated an exception; euro in the Bulgarian Cyrillic alphabet is spelled as eвро (evro) and not eуро (euro) in all official documents. In the Greek script the term ευρώ (evró) is used; the Greek [...] "cent" [...] coins are denominated in λεπτό/ά (leptó/á). Official practice for English-language EU legislation is to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> euro and cent as both singular and plural, although the European Commission's Directorate-General for Translation states that the plural forms euros and cents should be used in English.|$|E

5000|$|Older books, {{when they}} <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "range", {{tend to use}} it to mean what is now called the codomain.

500|$|In {{these two}} poems, the real hero {{is not the}} dog Ailbe but the pig – the latter being [...] "practically a panegyric on the pig" [...] – {{although}} the story's title implies {{this may have been}} an original feature. In the unusual choice of a pig as the main protagonist, the story becomes associated with a broader Celtic tradition, including the wild boar motif of Arthurian legend. The wild boar Twrch Trwyth, for example, causes considerable difficulty for the men of Arthur's court in the 11th-century Welsh story of Culhwch and Olwen; while the exposition of the geographical details of Ailbe's route in the rout of the Connachta in the Irish tale has parallels with the route taken by Twrch Trwyth in the Welsh hunt. Indeed, Thurneysen notes that in relation to Mac Da Thó's pig, the poets <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> torc (boar) and muc (pig) interchangeably.|$|E
500|$|Songs such as [...] "Cupid" [...] (Sam Cooke), [...] "You Are My Destiny" [...] (Paul Anka) and [...] "I Can't Let Go" [...] (The Hollies) {{are used}} {{within the first}} verse, while other verses <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of such song titles as [...] "Burning Love" [...] (Elvis Presley) and [...] "Two Hearts" [...] (Bruce Springsteen). Other {{instances}} include The Association song reference and Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Richard Burt, author of Shakespeare After Mass Media, deduced that the lines on Romeo and Juliet and [...] "I Can't Let Go" [...] makes the speaker alternate between assertiveness and dependency. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that although [...] "Cherish" [...] was a [...] "radiant" [...] song invoking the pop music of the 60s, [...] "in the grand pop scheme, [...] pales only in comparison to their glorious counterparts, making Like a Prayer one of the quintessential pop albums of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1792 {{elections}} {{were the first}} ones in U.S. history to be contested on anything resembling a partisan basis. In most states, the congressional {{elections were}} recognized in some sense as a [...] "struggle between the Treasury department and the republican interest," [...] to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of Jefferson strategist John Beckley. Because few doubted that Washington would receive {{the greatest number of}} electoral votes, the vice presidency became a focus of popular attention. The speculation here also tended to be organized along partisan linesHamiltonians supported Adams and Jeffersonians favored New York governor George Clinton. Both however were technically candidates for president competing against Washington, as electoral rules of the time required each presidential elector to cast two votes without distinguishing which was for president and which for vice president. The recipient of the most votes would then become president, and the runner-up vice president.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Using</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "hag" [...] to {{translate}} terms found in non-English (or non-modern English) is contentious, since <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> is {{often associated with}} misogyny.|$|R
50|$|The choice not to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'preventive' in <b>the</b> 2002 National Security Strategy, {{and instead}} <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'preemptive' was largely in {{anticipation}} of the widely perceived illegality of preventive attacks in international law, via both Charter Law and Customary Law.|$|R
500|$|Hammerstein and Rodgers {{returned}} to the Liliom project in mid-1944. [...] Hammerstein was uneasy as he worked, fearing {{that no matter what}} they did, Molnár would disapprove of the results. [...] Green Grow the Lilacs had been a little-known work; Liliom was a theatrical standard. [...] Molnár's text also contained considerable commentary on the Hungarian politics of 1909 and the rigidity of that society. [...] A dismissed carnival barker who hits his wife, attempts a robbery and commits suicide seemed an unlikely central character for a musical comedy. [...] Hammerstein decided to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> and story to make the audience sympathize with the lovers. [...] He also built up the secondary couple, who are incidental to the plot in Liliom; they became Enoch Snow and Carrie Pipperidge. [...] "This Was a Real Nice Clambake" [...] was repurposed from a song, [...] "A Real Nice Hayride", written for Oklahoma! but not used.|$|E
500|$|On May 1, 1991, Henderson {{stole his}} 939th base to pass Lou Brock {{and became the}} sport's all-time stolen base leader. Henderson's speech (at right) after {{breaking}} Brock's record {{was similar to the}} standard victory or award speech. He thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. Because his idol was Muhammad Ali, Henderson decided to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "greatest of all time." [...] These words have since been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant, although years later, Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock, and the Cardinals Hall of Famer [...] "had no problem with it. In fact, he helped me write what I was going to say that day." [...] On the day of the speech, Brock later told reporters amiably, [...] "He spoke from his heart." [...] Brock and Henderson had had a friendly relationship ever since their first meeting in 1981. Brock pronounced the young speedster as the heir to his record, saying, [...] "How are we gonna break it?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{institution}} of slavery existed {{in all of}} the original thirteen British North American colonies. Prior to the Thirteenth Amendment, the United States Constitution (adopted in 1789) did not expressly <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> slave or slavery but included several provisions about unfree persons. The Three-Fifths Compromise (in Article I, Section 2, Clause 3) allocated Congressional representation based [...] "on the whole Number of free Persons" [...] and [...] "three fifths of all other Persons". This clause was a compromise between Southerners who wished slaves to be counted as 'persons' for congressional representation and northerners rejecting these out of concern of too much power for the South, because representation in the new Congress would be based on population in contrast to the one-vote-for-one-state principle in the earlier Continental Congress. Under the Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3), [...] "No person held to Service or Labour in one State" [...] would be freed by escaping to another. [...] allowed Congress to pass legislation outlawing the [...] "Importation of Persons", but not until 1808. However, for purposes of the Fifth Amendment—which states that, [...] "No person shall... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"—slaves were understood as property. Although abolitionists used the Fifth Amendment to argue against slavery, it became part of the legal basis in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) for treating slaves as property.|$|E

500|$|The NFL upset a {{large number}} of fans by {{threatening}} churches with lawsuits if they had Super Bowl parties. National Football League assistant counsel Rachel L. Margolies {{sent a letter to the}} Fall Creek Baptist Church in Indianapolis, ordering the church to cancel its party and remove the trademarked Super Bowl name from its website. She said that the church could not <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "Super Bowl" [...] as it violates trademark law, could not charge admission as that violates copyright law, could not use its projection screen (only one television could be used and it could not be over 55inches), and could not [...] "promote a message" [...] in connection with the game. Regarding the last point, the Fall Creek Baptist church planned to also show an extra video to highlight the Christian testimonies of Colts coach Tony Dungy and Chicago Bears coach Lovie Smith. [...] "While this may be a noble message", Rachel L. Margolies wrote, [...] "we are consistent in refusing the use of our game broadcasts in connection with events that promote a message, no matter the content." [...] Sports bars nationwide were allowed to show the game, as were businesses that televised sports as part of their everyday operations because they didn't charge admission and they left the message the NFL intended intact.|$|E
