It addresses three themes on which I question the discursive productions that subjectivate me in <b>my</b> <b>educational</b> <b>background</b> and initial teaching formation.

In the second instance, I analyze the establishment of teachingness through the film narratives and how they work to produce brands in subjectivity. And finally, I analyze {{the history of the}} school curriculum in the training of academic disciplines, particularly Biology, and how the historicity of the curriculum is important to understand the constructed nature of social practices and subjectivities...|$|R

[...] He attributes this unexpected success to his reading of authors such as D. H. Lawrence and his interest in poetry. The qualifications he had earned at the Portsmouth College of Technology gained him admission to the then, Newcastle upon Tyne campus of Durham University in 1955-56 where he studied for a Bachelor of Science degree in naval architecture. However, he found scientific study uninteresting and failed in all subjects in the examinations of June 1956. He did manage to pass chemistry on a second try in September, but once again, failed mathematics and physics. His studies at Durham were over.|$|R
30|$|I am {{completely}} unsatisfied {{with my work}} in {{the publishing}} house. I graduated {{from one of the}} leading universities in China, and my major was editing and publishing. When I first entered the publishing house, I thought I would be very successful due to <b>my</b> <b>educational</b> <b>background</b> and professional training. I was wrong. I have never been allowed to choose which books to publish or to edit. Even highly profitable books cannot be published without the manager’s approval. I only work on books assigned by the manager and check for typos. Actually, I am very good at advertising and promoting new books. I can design very attractive posters, and also know a lot about marketing. It is frustrating, however, that these skills are becoming less and less important due to the use of professional software in the publishing house. I am not the only person who has this problem. To be honest, a lot of junior editors feel the same way.|$|R

I support the SWB DEIR conclusion that identifies alternative 3 A as environmentally preferred to all other alternatives (3 B, 3 C, 4 A, 4 B). The health of native Steelhead Trout (Onchorynchus mykiss) can be recovered under Alternative 3 A, and the impacts to oak woodland and chaparral plant communities, to cultural resources, and to recreational facilities could be avoided if Alternative 3 A is implemented, by avoiding surcharge of Cachuma Lake. All other alternatives achieve the goal of protecting native steelhead, yet because they each propose surcharge of Cachuma Lake, they have detrimental impacts on other resources that could also be considered “public trust resources. ” The Santa Ynez River is a biological system, albeit greatly deteriorated from its original functioning, and existing facets of the system, for example, oak woodlands, should not be further compromised needlessly...|$|R

Firstly, it shifted stereotypes I had held, such as “all Chinese teachers think and teach this way”, when clearly Danping refreshingly didn’t think or teach that way at all! Secondly it revealed to me my arrogant assumptions, arising from <b>my</b> own unexamined <b>educational</b> <b>background,</b> as to how CFL teachers should be adapting to the Australian school context. I love the personal challenge, that in all intercultural work, the self becomes visible, and it isn’t always comfortable. Just as I have been defined as an East-coast white Australian, by Aboriginal Western Australians, it sharpened my recognition of the shaping of <b>my</b> <b>educational</b> beliefs by <b>my</b> <b>educational</b> heritage.

At this time, furniture becomes to be the spiritualization carrier: they could contain the history and culture; they could make people relax and bring belongingness; they could show the preference of the designers. The furniture, or all kind of design, can be more than passionless implements. That is the subject I want to explore. Because of <b>my</b> <b>educational</b> <b>background</b> in interior design and architecture, I usually search a way to balance between technology and people 2 ̆ 7 s emotions, and try to keep the function together with physical contact of design at the same time. Due to the awareness of `people-oriented 2 ̆ 7 concept, I researched and designed the Cocktail furniture series. The purpose of this thesis is to analysis this furniture set, which includes a chair, a coatrack and a table. The main theme of design is to create a relaxing area with soft curved lines and round shapes, and use as few pieces as possible to reduce the weight and waste of material. I used the computer graphics, algorithms and ergonomics, Thermal Forming and Computer Numerical Control techniques together to produce the building-block combination furniture with sustainable plywood and HDPE plastic. Furthermore the use of Ergonomic, such as replaceable pieces, applies the humanistic care in the furniture. Within the consideration of function and aesthetic demands, I want to create the kind of design that can bring the joy and comfort for customers...|$|R
40|$|Sustainability is a buzzword {{covering}} {{a variety of}} fields and subjects. For the purposes of my research sustainability is “the ability to keep going over the long haul. As a value, it refers to giving equal weight in your decisions to the future {{as well as the}} present” (Gilman 1). The sustainability movement refers to activists, educators and researchers who are dedicated to finding high quality ways of living in the world that are environmentally benign for all who are now living as well future generations to come (Gilman 1). This research focuses on three women who engage in voluntary simplicity— “simplicity that is voluntary-consciously chosen, deliberate, and intentional- [and] supports a higher quality of life” (Elgin 4). The complexity of the subject of sustainability is why I chose to narrow my focus to such a worldview and because much of <b>my</b> <b>educational</b> <b>background</b> is in Gender and Women’s Studies I specifically focus on women. Feminist ethnographic methods of participant observation are utilized as well as rhetorical analysis. I examine the attentive roles that have afforded these women the ability to form intimate social as well as ecological relations in their community. The observations are recorded in a narrative form and contribute to the growing knowledge base of sustainability as well as resilience studies. The lack of sustainable practices on a large scale in our country affects every citizen who lives here through environmental problems like climate change and peak oil. The narrative form allows the research I have collected to maintain an accessible language which is important in reaching a greater audience beyond that of academia. The narrative shows easy, manageable sustainable choices and changes that can be applied at the micro as well as macro level. These choices and changes are not exhaustive or all inclusive; rather they are suggestions for those who are interested in joining the sustainability movement...|$|R

As a teacher in {{different}} schools, I have seen how my teaching colleagues are using the computer as a tool in teaching. This has caused me to be inspired by my colleagues 'and students' interest in computers. My thought and my purpose with this work is to develop mother tongue education, thereby bringing it in to year 2016. I will find out what the difficulties and obstacles that modernization may face, and how it can be tackled and how we can overcome the difficulties. To answer this I will carry out a qualitative study in the form of semi-structured interviews. I'm not going to interview other teachers, but am <b>using</b> <b>my</b> <b>educational</b> capital to answer my questions but will, however, conduct interviews with my students who have mother tongue education.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways that educators could teach drama if it were {{simply a matter of}} choosing from a range of available options. Teachers hold beliefs about drama which may facilitate or constrain both its selection and practice. These constraints encompass other beliefs about self, the role of the teacher, student role, the organisation of learning and interpersonal relationships. Thus, teachers do not construct views about drama (aims, possibilities, practices and outcomes) in isolation. Rather, these are directly influenced by other dispositions, {{not the least of which}} are those pertaining to education (Errington 1985). As a teacher, I will only select particular kinds of drama if they agree with my beliefs about teaching and education. That is, providing the drama can be <b>used</b> to put <b>my</b> <b>educational</b> beliefs into practice, I will use it. Similarly, what I observe in drama practice will modify my theories about teaching and education. In this sense, teacher beliefs about drama and education are dialectical.

My Intent for this design thesis project is to explore one such method: the placement of an educational facility In a non-traditional setting. Whether or not this method actually Improves public education is not the focus of my project; instead, the development and design of a facility that promotes learning, encourages conservation, enhances creative problem-solving and forward thinking, and integrates real world situations In an educational context {{is the focus of}} my thesis. The fulfillment of these conditions seems to be well-suited to a non-traditional setting, in this instance, a zoo. The facility will incorporate environmentally friendly materials and methods, energy efficient systems, and an innovative design that endorses the goals and objectives of the Association of Zoo and Aquariums and the mission statement of this zoo In particular. The outcome of this project will be to create an educational facility and animal outreach program that will be used as a full-time alternative school for public school children. It will also be a resource center for educators, leaders of organized groups (such as boy/girl scouts,) families, church groups, and other parties Interested In opportunities to connect to nature. Overnight visits, Saturday and summer camps, field trips, pre-school and after school programs, animal encounter shows, nature workshops, birthday parties, and other such events will be projected uses for this facility. The design of the building will fit the context of the existing zoo structures but will also be one that excites visitors and emphasizes the message of care and concern for nature and wildlife. In addition to providing a place for people to learn and grow, this facility will house a small number of animals. Of particular focus will be how architecture can be used to enhance the educational experience for students and zoo visitors and how architecture can be used to incorporate a school environment into a zoo setting. I plan to explore these two conditions through research, a literature review, interviews with educators, administrators, and zoologists, and site visits to the Henry Doorly Zoo and other zoos In the United States. I am especially excited about this thesis project because of my past experience and education. A former teacher with over 15 years of classroom experience, I have some awareness of appropriate school design. Having worked as a zoo school teacher at the Fort Worth Zoo In Fort Worth, Texas for several years, I have learned much about animal conservation and Wildlife preservation. I understand ways in which zoo classrooms need to differ from traditional classroom settings. <b>My</b> <b>educational</b> <b>background,</b> including a Master 2 ̆ 7 s Degree in Education, has provided me with a deep knowledge base from which to draw {{for the development of the}} environmental, educational, and spatial needs for this project. It is my belief, therefore, that I can utilize my current expertise, past experience, and prior knowledge to design a facility that incorporates my three greatest passions: children, animals, and architecture. Through this project I hope to improve my design skills, increase my understanding of the design process, and advance my proficiency as an architect...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{background}} of globalization and nursing shortage in Finland, there is an increasing trend of nurse migration from China to Finland. Nurse is a highly professional occupation. Understanding nurses’ interpretation of themselves as professionals would {{lay the foundation for}} promoting these nurses’ professional level, which would improve the quality of care nurses provide to patients, help to retain nurses in the area, and mitigate the shortage of nursing force. Nevertheless, there are currently few studies conducted from the perspective of professionalism of migrant nurses. As a result, I decide to situate my study in this field, and my research question is: How do migrant nurses from China to Finland interpret themselves as professionals. To answer this research question, a qualitative research was conducted and nine interviews were done with Chinese migrant nurses that are currently working in Finland. Studies on professionalism point out that professionalism has been tranforming from occupational to organizational, with many occupations losing their control of the profession to large organizations. Legislation, professional associations and hospitals are the three main factors influencing nursing professionalism. Miller with colleagues developed a model evaluating nursing professionalism that was widely used later on. Combining Miller’s model with empirical studies on nursing professionalism, I focused on four prominent categories in <b>my</b> research: <b>educational</b> <b>background,</b> continuing education and competency, communicative skills, and adherence to the code of ethics. Two other categories that were rarely mentioned in literature emerged from my data: difference in nursing practice, and respect from patients and colleagues. This study found out that the shift of these migrant nurses' interpretation is multi-layered. Better chances of further education, being able {{to pay more attention to}} each patient, being more respected make the nurses believe that they are professional in Finland; huge language barrier makes them cause damage to their self-confidence as professionals. Differences in the nurses' daily practicing procedures have various influence on their self-interpretation as professionals, while differences in nursing education and training have little influence on the interpretation...|$|R
