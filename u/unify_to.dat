60|$|Moreover, before Germany can <b>unify</b> <b>to</b> the East {{she must}} fight the Russian, and to <b>unify</b> <b>to</b> the West she must fight the French {{and perhaps the}} English, and she may have to fight a {{combination}} of these powers. I think the military strength of France is enormously underrated. Upon this matter M. Bloch should be read. Indisputably the French were beaten in 1870, indisputably they have fallen behind in their long struggle to maintain themselves equal with the English on the sea, but neither of these things efface the future of the French. The disasters of 1870 were probably of the utmost benefit to the altogether too sanguine French imagination. They cleared the French mind of the delusion that personal Imperialism is the way to do the desirable thing, a delusion many Germans (and, it would seem, a few queer Englishmen and still queerer Americans) entertain. The French have done much to demonstrate the possibility of a stable military republic. They have disposed of crown and court, and held themselves in order for thirty good years; they have dissociated their national life from any form of religious profession; they have contrived a freedom of thought and writing that, in spite of much conceit to the contrary, is quite impossible among the English-speaking peoples. I find no reason to doubt the implication of M. Bloch that on land to-day the French are relatively far stronger than they were in 1870, that the evolution of military expedients has been all in favour of the French character and intelligence, and that even a single-handed war between France and Germany to-day might have a very different issue from that former struggle. In such a conflict it will be Germany, and not France, that will have pawned her strength to the English-speaking peoples on the high seas. And France will not fight alone. She will fight for Switzerland or Luxembourg, or the mouth of the Rhine. She will fight with the gravity of remembered humiliations, with the whole awakened Slav-race {{at the back of her}} antagonist, and very probably with the support of the English-speaking peoples.|$|E

MRM is a technique in modeling and simulation for capturing the combined semantics of multiple models. Previous MRM approaches, such as selective viewing and aggregation-disaggregation, have encountered problems such as chain disaggregation, temporal inconsistency and mapping inconsistency. Eliminating these problems has been a difficult task for MRM designers. We eliminate these problems by showing how to achieve MRM effectively, i. e., correctly, consistently and inexpensively. Our thesis is that MRM can be effective. Maintaining consistency among the concurrent representations of jointly-executing models is our approach for effective MRM. We developed a framework, <b>UNIFY,</b> <b>to</b> achieve effective MRM. UNIFY satisfies three MRM requirements: multi-representation interaction, multi-representation consistency and cost-effectiveness.

Elasticity is realized by scaling dataplane resources {{as a function of}} traffic load. To achieve this, the service includes a custom scaling logic and monitoring capabilities. An automated monitoring framework not only triggers elastic scaling, but also a troubleshooting process which detects and analyzes anomalies, pro-actively aiding both dev and ops personnel. Such a DevOps-inspired approach enables a shorter update cycle to the running service. We highlight multiple learnings yielded throughout the prototype realization, focussing on the functional areas of service decomposition and scaling; programmable monitoring; and automated troubleshooting. Such practical insights will contribute to solving challenges such as agile deployment and efficient resource usage in future NFV platforms...|$|E
