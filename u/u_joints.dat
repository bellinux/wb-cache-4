The Super Duty models then used a solid axle version of this axle. The ring, pinion, carrier and <b>u</b> <b>joints</b> all remained the same however. The Dana 50 was phased out of the trucks in 2004, in favor of the Dana 60 and was last used in the Ford Excursion.|$|E
50|$|For steel materials, {{oxyacetylene}} cutting is {{the most}} common form of preparation. This technique is advantageous because of its speed, low cost, and adaptability. Machining {{is the most}} effective for reproducibility and mass production of parts. Preparation of J or <b>U</b> <b>joints</b> is common prepared by machining due to the need for high accuracy. The chipping method is used to prepare parts that were produced by casting. The use of grinding to prepare pieces is reserved for small sections that cannot be prepared by other methods. Air carbon arc cutting is common in industries that work with stainless steels, cast iron, or ordinary carbon steel.|$|E

30|$|According to the {{reciprocal}} screw theory [27], {{we know that}} every limb of 2 RPU/UPR PM exists a constraint force and a constraint couple. In each limb, the constraint force passes through the <b>U</b> <b>joint</b> and {{is parallel to the}} axis of R joint; and the constraint couple is perpendicular to all of the rotational axes. Therefore, the direction of constraint couples is identical, in other words, this PM has one common constraint.|$|R
50|$|Current {{vehicle bodies}} are {{designed}} around the mechanicals of existing engine/transmission setups. It is restrictive {{and far from}} ideal to install petro-hydraulic mechanicals into existing bodies not designed for hydraulic setups. One research project's {{goal is to create}} a blank paper design new car, to maximize the packaging of petro-hydraulic hybrid components in the vehicle. All bulky hydraulic components are integrated into the chassis of the car. One design has claimed to return 130 mpg in tests by using a large hydraulic accumulator which is also the structural chassis of the car. The small hydraulic driving motors are incorporated within the wheel hubs driving the wheels and reversing to claw-back kinetic braking energy. The hub motors eliminates the need for friction brakes, mechanical transmissions, drive shafts and <b>U</b> <b>joints,</b> reducing costs and weight. Hydrostatic drive with no friction brakes are used in industrial vehicles. The aim is 170 mpg in average driving conditions. Energy created by shock absorbers and kinetic braking energy that normally would be wasted assists in charging the accumulator. A small fossil fuelled piston engine sized for average power use charges the accumulator. The accumulator is sized at running the car for 15 minutes when fully charged. The aim is a fully charged accumulator which will produce a 0-60 mph acceleration speed of under 5 seconds using four wheel drive.|$|E

40|$|Kinetic {{viscoelasticity}} modeling {{has been}} successfully utilized to describe phenomena during cure of thermoset based carbon fiber reinforced matrices. The basic difference from classic viscoelasticity is that the fundamental material descriptors change {{as a result of}} reaction kinetics. Accordingly, we can apply the same concept for different kinetic phenomena with simultaneous curing and degradation. The application of this concept can easily be utilized in processing and manufacturing of carbon–carbon composites, where phenolic resin matrices are cured degraded and reinfused in a carbon fiber bed. This work provides a major step towards understanding complex viscoelastic phenomena that go beyond simple thermomechanical descriptors. United States.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{kinematic}} analyses of four translational parallel manipulators (3 RPC, SPS + 2 RPC, RPPR + 2 RPC and RPPR + 2 PPP) articulated with linear actuators. They are based on serially connected chains which are connected with cylindrical (C), prismatic (P), revolute (R), spherical (S) and universal (<b>U)</b> <b>joints.</b> Of these manipulators, the one which is a fully decoupled, fully isotropic and singularity-free translational parallel manipulator (RPPR+ 2 PPP) offers a one-to-one correspondence between its input and output displacement. This makes its forward and inverse position analyses simpler {{with a set of}} linear equations to be solved. Although the other manipulators have coupled kinematics, they still have simpler forward kinematic equations over other well-known translational parallel manipulators reported in the literature. We also employ screw theory to undertake the velocity and acceleration analyses. The primary contribution of this manuscript is to show how the 3 -RPC translational parallel manipulator can be gradually modified in order to obtain a fully isotropic, fully decoupled and singularity-free translational parallel manipulator...|$|E

30|$|Discussion: In general, a {{kinematic}} joint possesses {{more than}} one constraint reaction, for example, there exist 5, 4, 4 and 3 constraint reactions for an R <b>joint,</b> universal <b>joint</b> (<b>U),</b> cylindrical <b>joint</b> (C), and spherical joint (S), respectively. If we adopt traditional methods to build the force and moment equilibrium equations of all movable bodies and complementary equations, the rank of the coefficient matrix of those equations will be very large. This method, {{which is based on}} resultant constraint wrenches, can avoid the high-rank matrix, reduce a certain number of unknowns, and ensure that the number of simultaneous equilibrium equations is not more than six each time. However, it is only suitable for solving the driving forces/torques and constraint forces/moments of passive overconstrained PMs with collinear constraint forces or coaxial constraint moments.|$|R
