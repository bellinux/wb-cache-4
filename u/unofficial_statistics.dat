50|$|Uyghur {{migration}} to Kyrgyzstan can be analysed in three waves. The first wave {{began in the}} late 19th century. Some Uyghurs from Kashgar came with the Dungans to the Ferghana Valley {{in the aftermath of the}} 1862-1877 uprising in northwest China; the total number to settle there (including both Uyghurs and Dungans) was about 7,000 people, according to contemporary Russian reports. Later, in the early 20th century, Uyghurs, Dungans, and Chinese alike came as migrant workers to find employment in coal mines and cotton mills. The second wave consists of those who fled Xinjiang after the People's Republic of China established control in the area, or during the hardships of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. The people in this second wave tend to be connected to the political and intellectual elite of the Second East Turkestan Republic, and accordingly sometimes look down on the migrants who came before or after them. The 1979 Soviet census found 29,817 Uyghurs in the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic, making up 0.8% of the population. Their numbers continued to grow in the following decade; the 1989 census found 36,779 (0.9%). The third wave of migration consists of sojourners, PRC citizen traders of Uyghur and other ethnicities who take up temporary residence, typically in Bishkek, to engage in trade. The 1999 Kyrgyzstan census found 46,944 Uyghurs living in the country (1.0%); the 2009 census found 48,543 (0.9%). <b>Unofficial</b> <b>statistics</b> give even higher estimates, ranging from 100,000 to 200,000 people; Uyghur organisations explain the discrepancy as the result of Uyghurs registering themselves as Uzbeks in their official papers.|$|E
40|$|When forming expectations, {{households}} may {{be influenced}} by perceived bias in the information they receive. In this paper, we study how individuals learn from potentially biased statistics using data from both a natural experiment and a survey experiment during a period (2007 – 15) when the government of Argentina was manipulating official inflation statistics. This period is interesting because attention was being given to inflation information and both official and <b>unofficial</b> <b>statistics</b> were available. Our evidence suggests that, rather than ignoring biased statistics or naively accepting them, households react in a sophisticated way, as predicted by a Bayesian learning model. We also find evidence of an asymmetric reaction to inflation signals, with expectations changing more when the inflation rate rises than when it falls. These results could also be useful for understanding the formation of inflation expectations in less extreme contexts than Argentina, such as the United States and Europe, where experts may agree that statistics are unbiased but households are not.

The cost of the outbreak is estimated in the region of £ 20 billion, and may be increased by future compensation claims. The impact on the livestock industry in the United Kingdom (UK) has been severe. The reduction in numbers of livestock coincides with Government policy and may be permanent, and the damage to animal genetic resources has been significant. There are demands for a public inquiry to define the systemic failure of the control measures, and a review of methods of livestock production and marketing to re-evaluate the benefits of local production...|$|E

This indicates the market of small-scale shopping centres is significant and cannot be ignored. In fact, many studies were done by scholars regarding the successful management of large-scale shopping centres, yet detailed study related to such kind of small-scale shopping centres is found absent or pretty rare. Under observation, the management of stand-alone large-scale shopping centres is too perfect to criticize, whereas the same of small-scale shopping centres is unsystematic or can be called messy. Obstruction, security loophole, poor management and cleaning problem found in these shopping centres not only produce great nuisance to the owners/ occupiers, but also transform to be a social problem. The major scope in this study will be around the facilities and management services provided in small-scale shopping centres underneath composite building (residential + retail) or commercial building (office + retail).

40|$|The Hong Kong {{construction}} industry {{is facing a}} severe labor shortage due to an aging workforce {{and a lack of}} new entrants, even at a time of a construction boom. To improve this situation, ethnic minorities (EMs) have been attracted to join the {{construction industry}}. In many developed countries, however, some <b>unofficial</b> <b>statistics</b> show that EMs suffer higher fatality rates than their local counterparts. It is clear that the safety of EM construction workers requires more attention. This study evaluates the safety climate among EM construction workers in Hong Kong, predicts the impact of safety climate factors that affect the likelihood of injury occurrences, and determines the relationships between safety climate and the safety performance of EM workers. A questionnaire survey was administrated to Pakistani and Nepalese construction workers in Hong Kong. The results reveal that the overall average safety climate score for both EM groups was not very high and that the Pakistani worker scores were higher than the Nepalese worker scores. Frontline EM workers scored less than EM supervisors and managers. Among seven safety climate factors, ""Workers personal involvement in safety and health"" was ranked highest and ""Perception of safety rules and regulations"" was ranked lowest. ""Risk-taking behavior and perception of work risk"" and ""Workers personal involvement in safety and health"" were identified as significant predictors of injury occurrence. Furthermore, the safety climate is significantly associated with the degree of safety participation and safety compliance. It is expected that the findings of the study will provide insight into the level of safety climate among EM workers, enabling organizations and practitioners around the world to improve safe working among EM workers.

40|$|Handicraft {{is a kind}} of {{cultural}} and artistic symbol and since handmade goods represent historical, social and cultural characteristics of the country they were made in, they can be an important factor in introducing the related culture and civilization and can also attract tourists. Decorating and processing precious stones are included in handicraft, an art as old as the history of Iran. Minerals and precious stones were considered valuable since long ago and people used them as jewelry. As well as ornamental uses, these minerals have industrial uses and there are great demands for some of them like diamond led to make costume jewelry. Despite the existence of some costume jewelries, the fragility and intricacy in nature created by the omnipotent hands of the Creator is never imitable for human. Hence, real precious gems have always maintained their value and even their prices increased after the appearance of artificial gems. According to some <b>unofficial</b> <b>statistics,</b> the minerals and precious stones in different countries is estimated at 600 billion dollars a year. 400 billion of that belongs to precious gems whose 75 % is estimated to belong to diamond. Africa and Asia are the largest producers of diamond and precious gems respectively. Greatest makers of jewelry in the world are some small companies which work independently. The value added earned by a country through developing the section of precious stones is more than other huge sections of industry and mining in terms of their costs.

40|$|To the visitor, Istanbul, Turkey is {{flush with}} food. But food supply {{and access to}} food can be unrelated. Socioeconomic, {{demographic}} and development data suggest food security problems for {{a significant portion of}} the population. After World War II, migrants to Istanbul from Anatolia who built house gardens within their original squatter settlements (gecekondus) have sold their lands or turned them into apartments. Similarly, only fragments of the traditional network of commercial, intensive urban gardens (bostans) in Istanbul remain. In addition, the expanding system of European style supermarkets and commercial production in the global marketplace are changing the traditional urban food networks built around such institutions as the neighborhood bazaar. To begin to understand the shifting components of Istanbul's food system, information from numerous sources was gathered and analyzed. The main field data of my research are interviews with Istanbul farmers and residents; interviews with government officials, academics, and professionals; official and <b>unofficial</b> <b>statistics</b> from governments and associations; and surveys. Supplementary information is from Turkish newspaper sources, library materials, and various books and maps. Through kinship relations, labor mobility, the availability of formal and informal economic and transportation networks and the persistence of small, family farms nationwide, food security in Istanbul is supported by food individually and communally transferred from the countryside. Subsistence agricultural production across rural Turkey appears to play a vital role in feeding the urban population through informal food delivery and distribution channels. Thus, despite reductions in rural populations and appearances that rural and agricultural communities are declining, their productivity may be as important as ever. With their emphases on resource use, adaptation, consideration of multiple scales, and the exercise of local agency within structures of power and wealth, political and cultural ecology provide perspectives from which to meaningfully analyze food security needs and practices in Istanbul. Such a framework is enhanced by contributions from research in food systems and food security. Time centered tactics, exchange entitlements and food accessibility within the city cannot be understood apart from its relationship to the countryside...|$|E
