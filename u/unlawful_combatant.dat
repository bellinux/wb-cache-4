40|$|The {{recent changes}} in the {{physiognomy}} of the battlefield have provoked intense discussions about the role and legal status of private military and security companies (PMSCs) {{and the relationship between}} them and some traditional, albeit recently redefined concepts, especially that of <b>unlawful</b> <b>combatants.</b> The term <b>unlawful</b> <b>combatants,</b> and other terms occasionally used in its stead, have gradually evolved to encompass three different categories of persons: combatants failing to distinguish themselves from civilians; persons taking a direct part in hostilities without being legally entitled to do so; and, in the post-September 11 th, 2001, period, enemies in the “war on terror”. This factual categorization does not translate into a normative one, because persons from different categories, and sometimes even from the same category, do not have identical legal statuses and are subject to different sets of IHL norms. There is no obvious link between PMSCs and <b>unlawful</b> <b>combatants.</b> Some PMSCs’ members may fall into one of the three categories of <b>unlawful</b> <b>combatants,</b> but in view of PMSCs’ plurality, there is no pattern here. The concept of <b>unlawful</b> <b>combatants</b> therefore cannot truly enrich the discussion on private military and security companies, tending to introduce confusion rather than clarity...|$|R

2500|$|While {{the concept}} of an <b>unlawful</b> <b>combatant</b> is {{included}} in the Third Geneva Convention, the phrase itself does not appear in the document. Article 4 of Third Geneva Convention does describe categories under which a person may be entitled to POW status, and there are other international treaties that deny lawful combatant status for mercenaries and children. In the United States, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 codified the legal definition of this term and invested the U.S. President with broad discretion to determine whether a person may be designated an unlawful enemy combatant under United States law. The assumption that such a category as <b>unlawful</b> <b>combatant</b> exists is not contradicted by the findings of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Celebici Judgment. The judgment quoted the 1958 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) commentary on the Fourth Geneva Convention: Every person in enemy hands must be either a prisoner of war and, as such, be covered by the Third Convention; or a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention.

2500|$|In Hamdan v.

They overruled Congress' attempt to deprive the Court of jurisdiction to decide that issue by passing the Detainee Treatment Act. [...] Justices in the majority (particularly Justices Kennedy and Breyer) disagreed with Justice Stevens {{as to whether the}} [...] "charge" [...] of conspiracy could be maintained to justify the determination of <b>unlawful</b> <b>combatant</b> status. [...] Although the Court struck down the military commissions as created by the Executive Branch, they did not provide the detainees with direct access to the federal courts, but only with access to a fair and impartial hearing to a tribunal constitutionally authorized by Congress and proceeding with certain due process guarantees (such as one operated under terms similar to those provided by Article I courts under the UCMJ or according to the terms of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949).|$|E

50|$|Some {{have argued}} {{in favor of}} a summary {{execution}} of all <b>unlawful</b> <b>combatants,</b> using Ex parte Quirin as the precedent, a case during World War II that upheld the use of military tribunals for eight German saboteurs caught on U.S. soil while wearing civilian clothes. The Germans were deemed to be <b>unlawful</b> <b>combatants</b> and thus not entitled to POW status. Six of the eight were executed as spies in the electric chair on the request of the U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

40|$|The {{confusion}} {{associated with}} comprehending fundamental legal concepts associated with how America conducts the “War on Terror” {{centers around the}} unwillingness of the U.
