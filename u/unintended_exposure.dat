We spatially directed mesoendoderm differentiation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the ensuing cell migration in micropatterned human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) colonies to collectively form an annular mesoendoderm pattern. Teratogens could disrupt the two cellular processes to alter the morphology of the mesoendoderm pattern. Image processing and statistical algorithms were developed to quantify and classify the compounds’ teratogenic potential. We not only could measure dose-dependent effects but also correctly classify species-specific drug (Thalidomide) and false negative drug (D-penicillamine) in the conventional mouse embryonic stem cell test.

40|$|Abstract There {{are certain}} {{concerns}} regarding the safety {{for the environment}} and human health {{from the use of}} engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) which leads to <b>unintended</b> <b>exposures,</b> as opposed to the use of ENPs for medical purposes. This review focuses on the <b>unintended</b> human <b>exposure</b> of ENPs. In particular, possible effects in the brain are discussed and an attempt to assess risks is performed. Animal experiments have shown that investigated ENPs (metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes) can translocate to the brain from different entry points (skin, blood, respiratory pathways). After inhalation or instillation into parts of the respiratory tract a very small fraction of the inhaled or instilled ENPs reaches the blood and subsequently secondary organs, including the CNS, at a low translocation rate. Experimental in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that several types of ENPs can have various biological effects in the nervous system. Some of these effects could also imply that ENPs can cause hazards, both acutely and in the long term. The relevance of these data for risk assessment is far from clear. There are at present very few data on exposure of the general public to either acute high dose exposure or on chronic exposure to low levels of air-borne ENPs. It is furthermore unlikely that acute high dose exposures would occur. The risk from such exposures for damaging CNS effects is thus probably very low, irrespective of any biological hazard associated with ENPs. The situation is more complicated regarding chronic exposures, at low doses. The long term accumulation of ENPs can not be excluded. However, we do not have exposure data for the general public regarding ENPs. Although translocation to the brain via respiratory organs and the circulation appears to be very low, there remains a possibility that chronic exposures, and/or biopersistent ENPs, can influence processes within the brain that are triggering or aggravating pathological processes. In general, the present state of knowledge is unsatisfactory for a proper risk assessment in this area. Crucial deficits include lack of exposure data, the absence of a proper dose concept, and that studies often fail in adequate description of the investigated ENPs. </p...|$|R

40|$|Methods: Data {{from a large}} {{national}} surveillance {{study was}} used to describe antiretroviral regimens in pregnant women with HIV, with particular reference to the presence at conception of antiretroviral treatments contraindicated in pregnancy. Therapeutic changes during pregnancy were also analysed. Results: Among 334 women on antiretroviral treatment at conception, less than half (42. 4 %) reported current pregnancy as planned. A large number of different regimens (80) was observed. All the regimens included at least one nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors were present in similar proportions (39. 2 % and 40. 7 %, respectively). The most commonly used drugs were lamivudine (83. 2 % of regimens), zidovudine (50. 0 %), stavudine (d 4 T; 38. 0 %), nevirapine (25. 7 %), didanosine (ddl; 17. 7 %) and nelfinavir (17. 7 %). Treament with efavirenz (13. 5 % of regimens) and ddI+d 4 T (9. 6 %) was markedly frequent. Use of efavirenz at conception {{was associated with a}} subsequent treatment change during pregnancy (odds ratio [OR]: 13. 2.; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3. 2 - 53. 8, P < 0. 001). A similar but less strong association was found for ddI (OR: 1. 8; 95 % CI: 1. 03 - 3. 25, P= 0. 033), whereas being on nevirapine was associated with a lower risk (OR: 0. 58; 95 % CI: 0. 38 - 0. 81, P= 0. 013). Conclusions: Our data show that treatment at conception frequently represents the regimen previously selected for the treatment of the non-pregnant woman. The observed rates of exposure to contraindicated treatment should lead prescribing physicians to consider in HIV-positive women therapeutic choices that take into account the likelihood of an unplanned pregnancy. Such an approach is likely to reduce not only <b>unintended</b> <b>exposures</b> to contraindicated drugs, but also therapeutic changes during pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|Previously, TNO {{developed}} a probabilistic model {{to predict the}} likelihood of an allergic reaction, resulting in a quantitative assessment of the risk associated with <b>unintended</b> <b>exposure</b> to food allergens. The likelihood is estimated by including in the model {{the proportion of the}} population who is allergic, the proportion consuming the food and the amount consumed, the likelihood of the food containing an adventitious allergen and its concentration, and the minimum eliciting dose (MED) distribution for the allergen. In the present work a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify which parts of the model most influence the output. A shift in the distribution of the MED reflecting a more potent allergen, and an increase in the proportion of the population consuming a food, increased the number of estimated allergic reactions considerably. In contrast, the number of estimated allergic reactions hardly changed when the MEDs were based on a more severe response, or when the amount of food consumed was increased. Development of this work will help to generate a more accurate picture of the potential public health impact of allergens. It highlights areas where research is best focused, specifically the determination of minimum eliciting doses and understanding of the food choices of allergic individuals.

40|$|The {{production}} of vaccines in transgenic plants was first proposed in 1990 however no product has yet reached commercialization. There are several risks during {{the production and}} delivery stages of this technology, with potential {{impact on the environment}} and on human health. Risks to the environment include gene transfer and exposure to antigens or selectable marker proteins. Risks to human health include oral tolerance, allergenicity, inconsistent dosage, worker exposure and <b>unintended</b> <b>exposure</b> to antigens or selectable marker proteins in the food chain. These risks are controllable through appropriate regulatory measures at all stages of production and distribution of a potential plant-made vaccine. Successful use of this technology is highly dependant on stewardship and active risk management by the developers of this technology, and through quality standards for production, which will be set by regulatory agencies. Regulatory agencies can also negatively affect the future viability of this technology by requiring that all risks must be controlled, or by applying conventional regulations which are overly cumbersome for a plant production and oral delivery system. The value of new or replacement vaccines produced in plant cells and delivered orally must be considered alongside the probability and severity of potential risks in their pro-duction and use, and the cost of not deploying this technology – the risk of continuing with the status quo alternative...|$|E

Human lipoaspirate is a source of adult stem cells (pre-adipocytes), which are able to differentiate into various phenotypes, such as neurogenic lineage. Here, we analyse the suitability of these in vitro models in screening exogenous compounds, such as environmental pollutants, that may affect adipose cells and neurogenic development. To evaluate neurogenic differentiation, we analysed expression of cholinergic system and acetylcholinesterase immunoreactivity. Heterocyclic derivatives of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are often significant components of environmental contaminants. As they contain inducers of cytochrome P 450 1 A 1 (CYP 1 A 1), we explored the activity of CYP 1 A 1 -related enzymes, i. e. 7 -ethoxycoumarin- and 7 -ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (ECOD and EROD) in both cell systems in basal conditions and after exposure to non-cytotoxic doses of beta-naphthoflavone (BNF), a well-known PAH-type inducer. Both cell models showed basal and inducible levels of ECOD. Analysis of CYP 1 A 1 protein expression and EROD-related enzyme activity confirmed the inducibility of the CYP 1 A 1 isoform by BNF. These results demonstrate that mesenchymal adult stem cells can constitute innovative models.

In addition, two recently approved formulations of previously proven medications are in early phases of implementation. The sublingual film form of buprenorphine + naloxone (Suboxone&reg;) provides a less divertible, more quickly administered, more child-proof version than the buprenorphine + naloxone sublingual tablet. The injectable depot form of naltrexone (Vivitrol&reg;) ensures consistent opioid receptor blockade for one month between administrations, removing concerns about medication compliance. The clinical implications of these developments have attracted increasing attention from clinicians and policymakers in the US and around the world, especially given that human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and other infectious diseases are recognized as companions to opioid addiction, commanding more efforts to reduce opioid addiction.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report was to {{investigate}} the safety assessment of emulsification techniques and the variety of emulsion-based nanostructures (EBNS) that can be obtained and subsequently used in the food industry. Environmental issues will not be addressed. The number of nanotechnology applications is increasing and it is expected that the food industry will be the newest field in which nanotechnology will be applied. A conservative size definition of 500 nm was chosen for risk assessment purposes. Cells are capable of taking up nanostructures of up to 500 nm in size and nanostructures can be engineered with certain properties that could mimic effects of smaller sized nanostructures. Devices to produce emulsions and EBNS are already used in the food industry (homogenisers) while other methods are still being developed which are more efficient (low-energy methods). A large variety of nanostructures can be obtained with emulsification techniques such as simple emulsions, lipid nanostructures, solid nanostructures etc. Very {{little is known about the}} effects of nanostructures on the gastrointestinal tract.

Recommendations for a food nanostructure-specific risk assessment include the goal of the nanostructure (intended or <b>unintended</b> <b>exposure),</b> consideration of physicochemical properties relevant to food nanostructures (e. g. solubility), the history of safe use and a minimum amount of testing to ensure safety.

The different foams had a cell size of 2 – 400 μm, a density of 60 – 163 kg/m 3, and a compression modulus of 1 – 9 MPa. The integrity of the foams during swelling in water was improved by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde (GA) or by a thermal treatment at 130 °C, which polymerized the proteins. In the never-dried state, the foam acted as a sponge, and {{it was possible to}} squeeze out water and soak it repeatedly. If the foam was dried to its glassy state, then the cells collapsed and did not open again even if the solid foam was reimmersed in water, saving as a sensor mechanism {{that can be used to}} reveal <b>unintended</b> <b>exposure</b> to polar liquids such as water under a product’s service life. Small-angle X-ray scattering revealed that the gliadin-correlated structure expanded and then disappeared in the presence of water. The foam was made antimicrobial by impregnation with a Lanasol solution (a bromophenol existing in algae). It was also shown that the foam can act as a transfer/storage medium for liquids such as natural oils (rapeseed oil) and as a slow-release matrix for surfactant chemicals...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of nanoparticle interactions with tissues is complex. High levels of standardization, ideally testing of different material {{types in the}} same biological model, and combinations of sensitive imaging and detection methods are required. Here, we present our studies on nanoparticle interactions with skin, skin cells, and biological media. Silica, titanium dioxide and silver particles were chosen as representative examples for different types of skin exposure to nanomaterials, e. g., <b>unintended</b> environmental <b>exposure</b> (silica) versus intended exposure through application of sunscreen (titanium dioxide) or antiseptics (silver). Because each particle type exhibits specific physicochemical properties, {{we were able to}} apply different combinations of methods to examine skin penetration and cellular uptake, including optical microscopy, electron microscopy, X-ray microscopy on cells and tissue sections, flow cytometry of isolated skin cells as well as Raman microscopy on whole tissue blocks. In order to assess the biological relevance of such findings, cell viability and free radical production were monitored on cells and in whole tissue samples. The combination of technologies and the joint discussion of results enabled us to look at nanoparticle–skin interactions and the biological relevance of our findings from different angles...|$|R
40|$|The {{reproductive}} system is extremely susceptible to insults {{from exposure to}} exogenous steroids during development. Excess prenatal testosterone exposure programs neuroendocrine, ovarian, and metabolic deficits in the female, features seen in women with polycystic ovary disease. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether prenatal testosterone excess also disrupts the male {{reproductive system}}, using sheep as a model system. The extent of reproductive disruption was tested by assessing sperm quantity and quality as well as Leydig cell responsiveness to human chorionic gonadotropin. Males born to mothers treated with 30 mg testosterone propionate twice weekly from d 30 to 90 and with 40 mg testosterone propionate from d 90 to 120 of pregnancy (Tmales) showed a significant reduction (P < 0. 05) in body weight, scrotal circumference, and sperm count compared with control males. Mean straight line velocity of sperms was also lower in T-males (P < 0. 05). Circulating testosterone levels in response to the human chorionic gonadotropin did not differ between groups. These findings demonstrate that exposure to excess testosterone during fetal development has a negative impact on reproductive health of the male offspring, raising concerns relative to <b>unintended</b> human <b>exposure</b> to steroidal mimics in the environment. This work was supported by Fondecyt Research Project Grant 1050915...|$|R
40|$|Sweeping {{globalization}} {{has resulted in}} unparalleled economic growth, including increased international trade of hazardous chemicals. Fundamental differences between nations trading these materials, including language, literacy rates, cultural values, and technical and governmental infrastructures has created an urgent need for a common system of risk communication to reduce the occurrence of deaths and serious injuries that result from <b>unintended</b> chemical <b>exposures.</b> To accomplish this goal, the United Nations (UN) created the Globally Harmonized System for the Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) in 1992. Unfortunately, there was no requirement for testing of the GHS labeling components, including pictograms intended to depict specific hazards, before their deployment. In Experiment 1, twenty GHS hazard pictograms were subjected to comprehension testing in two non-student samples from the U. S. and Brazil, respectively. In Experiment 2, alternatives for five of the GHS pictograms that were least well understood were created and then re-tested for comprehension. Several of the new pictograms outperformed their “original ” GHS counterparts in terms of comprehension and participant preference. Overall, the results of testing showed {{that only a small}} portion of the original GHS hazard pictograms reached acceptable levels of comprehension. Therefore, additional systematic work is needed to develop GHS pictogram alternatives that effectively convey safety hazards to a global audience...|$|R
