It assumes that every packet loss is caused by network congestion and initialises its congestion control algorithm. Receiver-assisted congestion control (RACC) mechanism, in which the sender performs loss-based control, while the receiver is performing delay-based control. The receiver measures the network bandwidth based on the packet interarrival interval and compute a congestion window size deemed appropriate for the sender. After receiving the advertised value and then feeds this information back to the sender. The sender is to adjust its congestion window according to the advertised window of the receiver. By integrating the loss-based and delay-based congestion control, we can mitigate the effect of wireless loss, timeout effect. Experimental results show that our mechanism can improve the network throughput performance. Keywords:-Congestion control, rate estimation, transport protocol, wireless networks. I...|$|E
