40|$|We {{present a}} novel method to solve {{structure}} and motion problems robustly and incrementally from <b>unordered</b> <b>sets</b> of input images. The proposed method can build large reconstructions without depending on global structure for outlier rejection and starts {{from the most}} reliable parts of the data sets. The two main ideas are a strategy to identify reliable subsets of images that have the highest mutual compatibility and an ordering of the reconstruction buildup that gives higher priority to these subsets and merges new information according to this ordering. Another advantage of our buildup strategy is that loop closing is done unbiased by drift in spite of adding correspondence data incrementally. Correspondence information is only locally verified and merged into reconstructions without immediately removing outliers based on globally reconstructed structure. We demonstrate the robustness and scalability of our approach on several large reconstructions from <b>unordered</b> <b>sets</b> of images and indicate the achieved accuracy by preserving the topology of the 3 D structure and cameras. 1...|$|R

40|$|We derive {{a number}} of results related to the Gaudin model {{associated}} to the simple Lie algebra of type G$_ 2 $. We compute explicit formulas for solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations associated to the tensor product of an arbitrary finite-dimensional irreducible module and the vector representation. We use this result {{to show that the}} Bethe ansatz is complete in any tensor product where all but one factor are vector representations and the evaluation parameters are generic. We show that the points of the spectrum of the Gaudin model in type G$_ 2 $ are in a bijective correspondence with self-self-dual spaces of polynomials. We study the set of all self-self-dual spaces - the self-self-dual Grassmannian. We establish a stratification of the self-self-dual Grassmannian with the strata labeled by <b>unordered</b> <b>sets</b> of dominant integral weights and <b>unordered</b> <b>sets</b> of nonnegative integers, satisfying certain explicit conditions.

40|$|Abstract. Incremental reduced error pruning is a {{technique}} that has been extensively used for efficient induction of ordered rule sets (decision lists). Several criteria have been developed regarding how to prune rules {{and whether or not}} to exclude generated rules. A version of incremental reduced error pruning for <b>unordered</b> rule <b>sets</b> is presented, and the appropriateness of previously proposed criteria for the novel version is investigated. It is shown that when inducing <b>unordered</b> rule <b>sets,</b> where a Bayesian framework is used to combine predictions from multiple rules, previously proposed criteria could lead to exclusion of possibly beneficial rules as well as to inclusion of harmful rules. Two alternative criteria are introduced, one based on the likelihood ratio and one based on the margin. An empirical evaluation on 34 datasets shows that the novel criteria significantly outperform previously employed criteria when using incremental reduced error pruning for <b>unordered</b> rule <b>sets,</b> the margin-based being slightly ahead of the likelihood ratio criterion. ...|$|R
