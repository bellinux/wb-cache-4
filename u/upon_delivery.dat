5|$|Imperial Gift {{aircraft}} {{were shipped}} to Australia in 1919, assembled <b>upon</b> <b>delivery</b> in 1920 and served {{for up to}} 10 years. The Airco/de Haviland DH-9a (A1-17/F2779) was the longest serving Imperial Gift aircraft, being written off on 4 February 1930. The only original surviving Imperial Gift aircraft in Australia are an Avro 504K (A3-4/H2174), stored at the Treloar Technology Centre (Canberra) and an S.E.5a (A2-4/C1916), {{in the collection of}} the Australian War Memorial, exhibited in the ANZAC Hall of the main Australian War Memorial displays.|$|E
5|$|The {{cars had}} an aluminium-alloy {{double-skinned}} construction, and were delivered unpainted to save time. A red adhesive strip {{ran through the}} length of the cars in the middle to match the operator's visual branding. The unpainted cars had a shiny appearance <b>upon</b> <b>delivery,</b> but as dirt and grime accumulated it became a recurring problem for the operator and attracted several public complaints. In response, MRT Corporation built a wash machine at Bishan Depot in an attempt to clean up the cars' exterior proper. After refurbishment, the problem was solved by covering the cars' exterior entirely with giant stickers, creating a livery that is similar to the newer C751B and C151A rolling stocks.|$|E
5|$|The 767 entered {{service with}} United Airlines on September 8, 1982. The aircraft's first {{commercial}} flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route. The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service {{three months later}} with Delta Air Lines. <b>Upon</b> <b>delivery,</b> early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including US transcontinental services. American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while Air Canada, China Airlines, and El Al began operating the aircraft in 1983. The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater dispatch reliability than prior jetliners. In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1percent dispatch rate, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft. Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance. Resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings, the replacement of an evacuation slide latch, and the repair of a tailplane pivot to match production specifications.|$|E
30|$|SSTR 2 -based {{expression}} was readily visualized. VX 2 tumors infected with Ad-CMV-HA-SSTR 2 <b>upon</b> intra-arterial <b>delivery</b> with AII had greater in vivo biodistribution, thus greater gene expression, {{than those with}}out AII (p[*]<[*] 0.01, n[*]=[*] 6). VX 2 tumors infected with Ad-CMV-HA-SSTR 2 <b>upon</b> IA <b>delivery</b> had greater biodistribution, thus greater gene expression, than those with the negative control Ad-CMV-GFP (p[*]<[*] 0.02). Similarly, VX 2 tumors infected with Ad-CMV-HA-SSTR 2 <b>upon</b> IA <b>delivery</b> with AII had greater biodistribution, thus greater gene expression, than those with the negative control Ad-CMV-GFP (p[*]<[*] 0.01).|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s Kickers shoes {{become very}} {{successful}} in Britain. So much so in some case, children were queuing up until 10 o'clock at night waiting <b>upon</b> <b>deliveries,</b> and when the delivery did arrive the stock would be gone in a flash. Many children also collected the flower shape tag and {{did not believe the}} shoes were real Kickers unless this tag was included.|$|R
30|$|Gene {{therapy has}} been {{hampered}} by low expression <b>upon</b> in vivo <b>delivery.</b> Using a somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR 2)-based reporter, we assessed whether angiotensin II (AII) can improve gene expression by adenovirus <b>upon</b> intra-arterial (IA) <b>delivery</b> {{in a large}} animal model.|$|R

25|$|Specialized spam filters {{can reduce}} the number of {{phishing}} emails that reach their addressees' inboxes, or provide post-delivery remediation, analyzing and removing spear phishing attacks <b>upon</b> <b>delivery</b> through email provider-level integration. These approaches rely on machine learning and natural language processing approaches to classify phishing emails. Email address authentication is another new approach.|$|E

25|$|<b>Upon</b> <b>delivery</b> of all twenty-four factors, ESC-like colonies {{emerged that}} {{reactivated}} the Fbx15 reporter and could propagate indefinitely. To identify the genes necessary for reprogramming, the researchers removed one factor {{at a time}} from the pool of twenty-four. By this process, they identified four factors, Oct4, Sox2, cMyc, and Klf4, which were each necessary and together sufficient to generate ESC-like colonies under selection for reactivation of Fbx15.|$|E
25|$|The first 252 GT 350s for 1966 {{began as}} 1965 Mustang K-Code Fastbacks. These cars were {{specifically}} ordered by Shelby American for conversion into 1966 GT 350s. <b>Upon</b> <b>delivery</b> to Shelby-American, {{the cars were}} randomly picked for conversion. The Shelby VINs do not correspond in numerical order with Ford VINs. The Ford VINs were shipped in 'blocks,' but many differ significantly because the order they were taken for conversions.|$|E
25|$|The final {{disposition}} of the aircraft as of 1 October 1945, by letter of the Air Technical Service Command; 1-Washout <b>upon</b> <b>delivery</b> from factory, 5-Class 26, 10-Survey, 1-Condemned, 8-Reconstruction Finance Corp. to be sold as surplus. In the interim, the Curtiss-Wright plants at Buffalo, New York and Louisville, Kentucky went over to full production of the Curtiss C-46 Commando. USAAF Materiel Command later estimated the entire C-76 project cost the U.S. government $400 million dollars and several months in lost production time.|$|E
50|$|Patrick Henry Hughes {{was born}} March 10, 1988 to Patrick John and Patricia Hughes. <b>Upon</b> his <b>delivery,</b> {{the medical staff}} noticed {{physical}} anomalies. These were diagnosed as bilateral anophthalmia with pterygium syndrome and congenital bilateral hip dysplasia.|$|R

25|$|<b>Upon</b> her <b>delivery</b> to the Navy on 13 November 1918, West Mahomet was {{commissioned}} {{the same day}} as USS West Mahomet (ID-3681) for operation with the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS), with Lt. Comdr. Raymond O. Demarest, USNRF, placed in command.|$|R
25|$|A {{considerable}} amount of forwarding (advancing wares to the agent up front) {{was done by the}} caravans. The carrier gave a receipt for the consignment, took all responsibility, and exacted a receipt <b>upon</b> <b>delivery.</b> If he defaulted, he paid fivefold. He was usually paid in advance. Deposit, especially warehousing of grain, was charged for at one-sixtieth. The warehouse man took all risks and paid double for all shortage, but no claim could be made unless he had given a properly witnessed receipt.|$|E
25|$|WR {{recruits}} {{were promised}} uniforms upon reaching boot camp, {{but that was}} not always the case. In fact, during the summer of 1943, some recruits had to train in civilian clothing until uniforms were available. When the new uniforms arrived, {{they turned out to be}} winter uniforms. The seersucker summer uniforms had yet to be designed. Disputes about fabric, cut, and production had a delaying affect <b>upon</b> <b>delivery.</b> In time, these issues were resolved, and most WR members felt their uniforms were much better looking than those of the other women's military organizations.|$|E
25|$|The trams {{were first}} used on Line 13, which {{ran from the}} Sagene Line via Stortorvet to the Kjelsås Line. Half the {{original}} series was delivered by April 1953, allowing other lines to also use the new trams. The final tram of the original delivery series entered service on 14 December 1953. <b>Upon</b> <b>delivery</b> the trams had some issues with the controller. Upon occasion they would move to full speed or full break without being activated by the motorman, causing a few minor accidents. It turned out that this {{was caused by a}} combination of mechanical weakness and user errors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Upon</b> its <b>delivery</b> to the Kennedy Space Center in 1983, Discovery was {{modified}} alongside Challenger {{to accommodate the}} liquid-fueled Centaur-G booster, which had been planned for use beginning in 1986 but was cancelled {{in the wake of}} the Challenger disaster.|$|R

25|$|During 1975, a large {{order for}} 30 Mirage F1CHs and 20 Mirage F1EHs was placed by the Royal Moroccan Air Force (RMAF) with Dassault, {{the first of}} which to be {{delivered}} during 1978. <b>Upon</b> <b>delivery,</b> these were grouped into two squadrons, one focusing on ground-attack operations and the other upon air defence; comprising over a third of its fighter force, the Mirage F1 served as the primary air defence fighter of the RMAF for the next two decades. As early as 1979, these aircraft were engaged in combat missions against the forces of the Polisario Front, operating in Western Sahara. The RMAF lost seven Mirages as a result of hostile fire, along with a further six which had crashed due to different mishaps. Three Mirage pilots were killed and three were captured. According to politics author Anthony Cordesman, the RMAF has struggled to effectively service and operate all of its Mirage F1s, possibly {{due to a lack of}} funding for spare parts.|$|E
25|$|In September 1988, SF Line took {{delivery}} of the new MS Amorella, which replaced Rosella on the Turku–Stockholm route. Originally SF Line had agreed to sell the Rosella to Stena Line <b>upon</b> <b>delivery</b> of the new ship. However, due to the Amorella being delivered seven months behind schedule the Rosella could not be delivered to Stena when originally agreed. In the end the Turella was sold instead of Rosella, as it was generally in a better condition and easier to convert for the traffic Stena planned for her. After rebuilding at Cityvarvet, Gothenburg, the Turella re-emerged as MS Stena Nordica (a name carried by many Stena Line ships over the years). Stena Nordica was placed a route connecting Gothenburg to Fredrikshavn in Denmark and Moss in Norway. She also occasionally served on the Gothenburg–Kiel route when the ships normally sailing that route were docked. In 1996, Stena Nordica was rebuilt at Öresundsvarvet, Landskrona, Sweden, transferred to the fleet of Stena's subsidiary Lion Ferry and renamed MS Lion King. During the next 1½ years she sailed on routes Halmstad (Sweden) – Grenå (Denmark) and Karlskrona (Sweden) – Gdynia (Poland).|$|E

500|$|The kidnappers hold Charlie Bratley [...] {{whose parents}} are unaware that he is missing [...] {{overnight}} at Crystal's home. Dean eventually agrees to go to Troy's house to find the drugs. <b>Upon</b> <b>delivery,</b> Billy discovers that the bag doesn't contain the prescription drugs and starts a fight with Dean, leading to Dean's arrest. While trying to explain everything to Officer Lou Bratley (John Heard), Charlie's father, Dean reveals that his brother Charlie replaced the drugs {{with a bag of}} the vitamins that their mother Allie (Allison Janney) sells. Neither Officer Bratley nor Dean's father believes his story, but he is released, whereupon his father increases his dosage of antidepressants. Meanwhile, Charlie [...] crushes the real drugs and puts them into a casserole that his mother made for Troy's memorial.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with its}} revolutionary variable-sweep wings, the F-111 was {{equipped}} with terrain-following radar and an escape module that allowed the entire cockpit to be jettisoned in an emergency, instead of individual ejection seats. [...] Its top speed was Mach 2.5 and its combat radius gave it the capability of reaching targets in Indonesia from bases in northern Australia. [...] <b>Upon</b> <b>delivery</b> in 1973 it was fitted with analogue avionics and could only drop unguided ("dumb") bombs. In its 37 years of service with the RAAF the type went through several upgrades, including the Pave Tack infra-red and laser-guided precision weapons targeting system, Harpoon anti-shipping missiles, and advanced digital avionics. Alan Stephens, in the official history of the post-war Air Force, described the F-111 as [...] "the region's pre-eminent strike aircraft" [...] and the RAAF's most important acquisition. [...] The closest they came to being used in anger, however, was during Australian-led INTERFET operations in East Timor commencing in September 1999. Both F-111 squadrons were deployed to RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, to support the international forces in case of action by the Indonesian military, and remained there until December; six of No.1 Squadron's aircraft and approximately 100 personnel were involved. From 20September, when INTERFET forces began to arrive in East Timor, the F-111s were maintained {{at a high level}} of readiness to conduct reconnaissance flights or air strikes if the situation deteriorated. As it happened, INTERFET did not encounter significant resistance, and F-111 operations were limited to reconnaissance by RF-111Cs from 5November through 9December.|$|E
