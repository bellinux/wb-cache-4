First, we prove that an irreducible semigroup of <b>triangularizable</b> <b>matrices</b> in M_n(R) is absolutely irreducible, equivalently, it contains a vector space basis for M_n(R). In other words, M_n(R) is the only irreducible subalgebra of itself that is spanned by an irreducible semigroup of <b>triangularizable</b> <b>matrices</b> in M_n(R). Next, we use this result to show that, up to similarity, M_n(R) is the only irreducible R-algebra in M_n(H) that is spanned by an irreducible semigroup of matrices in M_n(H) with real inner eigenvalues.

40|$|We {{approach}} celebrated theorems of Burnside and Wedderburn via simultaneous triangularization. First, for {{a general}} field $F$, we prove that $M_n(F) $ is the only irrreducible subalgebra of <b>triangularizable</b> <b>matrices</b> in $M_n(F) $ provided such a subalgebra exists. This provides a slight generalization of a well-known theorem of Burnside. Next, for a given $n > 1 $, we characterize all fields $F$ such that Burnside's Theorem holds in $M_n(F) $, i. e., $M_n(F) $ is the only irreducible subalgebra of itself. In fact, for a subfield $F$ {{of the center of}} a division ring $D$, our simple proof of the aforementioned extension of Burnside's Theorem can be adjusted to establish a Burnside type theorem for irreducible $F$-algebras of <b>triangularizable</b> <b>matrices</b> in $M_n(D) $ with inner eigenvalues in $F$, namely such subalgebras of $M_n(D) $ are similar to $M_n(F) $. We use Burnside's theorem to present a simple proof of a theorem due to Wedderburn. Then, we use our Burnside type theorem to prove an extension of Wedderburn's Theorem as follows: A subalgebra of a semi-simple left Artinian $F$-algebra is nilpotent iff the algebra, as a vector space over the field $F$, is spanned by its nilpotent members and that the minimal polynomials of all of its members split into linear factors over $F$. We conclude with an application of Wedderburn's Theorem. Comment: 13 page...|$|R

40|$|We design two {{deterministic}} {{polynomial time}} algorithms for variants {{of a problem}} introduced by Edmonds in 1967 : determine the rank of a matrix M whose entries are homogeneous linear polynomials over the integers. Given a linear subspace B of the n by n matrices over some field F, we consider the following problems: symbolic matrix rank (SMR) is the problem to determine the maximum rank among matrices in B, symbolic determinant identity testing (SDIT) is the question to decide whether there exists a nonsingular matrix in B. The constructive versions of these problems are asking to find a matrix of maximum rank, respectively a nonsingular matrix, if there exists one. Our first algorithm solves the constructive SMR when B is spanned by unknown rank one matrices, answering an open question of Gurvits. Our second algorithm solves the constructive SDIT when B is spanned by <b>triangularizable</b> <b>matrices,</b> but the triangularization is not given explicitly. Both algorithms work over finite fields of size at least n+ 1 and over the rational numbers, and the first algorithm actually solves (the non-constructive) SMR independently from the field size. Our main tool to obtain these results is to generalize Wong sequences, a classical method to deal with pairs of matrices, {{to the case of}} pairs of matrix spaces.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} various {{questions}} in matrix theory over skew, fields. The common thread {{in all these}} considerations is the determination of an easily described form {{for a set of}} matrices, as simultaneously upper triangular or diagonal, for example. The first chapter, in addition to giving some results which prove useful in later chapters, describes the work of P. M. Cohn on the normal form of a single matrix over a skew field. We use these results to show that, if the skew field D has a perfect center, then any matrix over D is similar to a matrix with entries in a commutative field. The second chapter gives some results concerning commutativity, including the upper triangularizability of any set of commuting matrices, conditions allowing the simultaneous diagonalization of a set of commuting diagonalizable matrices, and a description, over skew fields with perfect centers, of matrices commuting with a given matrix. We end the chapter with a consideration of the problem of when a set of matrices over a skew field D is similar to a set of matrices with entries in a commutative sub-field of D. The questions of simultaneously upper triangular-icing and diagonalizing semigroups of matrices are considered in the third chapter. A closure operation is defined on semigroups of matrices over a skew field, and it is shown that a semigroup is <b>upper</b> <b>triangularizable</b> (diagonalizable) if and only if its closure is. Necessary and sufficient conditions are then given for closed semigroups to the upper triangularizahle (diagonalizable). The last chapter gives a few assorted results on groups of matrices, including the simultaneous upper triangularizability of a solvable group of unipotent matrices and a determination, for any skew field D, of those finite groups all of whose representations over D are diagonalizable. <p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look for}} closed {{expressions}} to calculate the number of colourings of prime knots for given linear Alexander quandles. For this purpose the colouring matrices are simplified to a triangular form, when possible. The operations used to perform this triangularization preserve the property that the entries in each row add up to zero, thereby simplifying {{the solution of the}} equations giving the number of colourings. When the colouring matrices (of prime knots up to ten crossings) can be triangularized, closed expressions giving the number of colourings can be obtained in a straightforward way. We use these results to show that there are colouring matrices that cannot be triangularized. In the case of knots with <b>triangularizable</b> colouring <b>matrices</b> we present a way to find linear Alexander quandles that distinguish by colourings knots with different Alexander polynomials. The colourings of knots with the same Alexander polynomial are also studied as regards when they can and cannot be distinguished by colourings. Comment: 51 page...|$|R

Finally, we give a characterization of the n-dimensional subspaces L ⊂Mn such that S(L) = ∅ by means of their intersections with conjugacy classes. 1. Preliminaries and introduction We work throughout over an algebraically closed field F of characteristic zero. We define F ∗ = F 0. We denote by #E the cardinality of a finite set E. The set of all (n × n) -matrices whose entries are elements of F is denoted by Mn. (We assume throughout that n ≥ 2.) The zero matrix and the unit matrix belonging to Mn are denoted by O and I, respectively. We define GLn to be the full linear group of size n over the field F, i. e. GLn = U ∈ Mn: det(U) 6 = 0. The conjugacy class of a matrix A ∈ Mn is denoted by O(A). (In other words, O(A) = U− 1 AU: U ∈ GLn.) A subset E ⊆ Mn is said to be triangularizable if there is a U ∈ GLn such that U− 1 EU: = U− 1 AU: A ∈ E consists of upper triangular matrices. The subset E is said to be GLn-invariant if U− 1 EU ⊆ E for all U ∈ GLn. We consider Fn, Mn ∼ = F n 2, and their subsets as topological spaces en-dowed with the Zariski topology.
