5|$|Expensive and {{elaborate}} ornamentation {{was an important}} part of a ship's appearance in the 1660s, even though it had been simplified since the early 17th century. Such ornamentation was believed to enhance the authority of absolute monarchs and to portray the ship as a symbol of martial prowess and royal authority. There are no contemporary illustrations of the ornamentation of Kronan, but according to common practice it was most lavish on the transom, the flat surface facing aft. There are two images of Kronan shown from the stern by two Danish artists. Both works were commissioned many years after the sinking to commemorate the Danish victory. Claus Møinichen's painting at Fredriksborg Palace from 1686 shows a transom dominated by two lions rampant holding <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> royal crown. The background is blue with sculptures and ornaments in gold. Swedish art historian Hans Soop, who has previously studied the sculptures of Vasa, a prestige ship of Gustavus Adolphus's navy that sank only 20 minutes into her maiden voyage in Stockholm in 1628, has suggested that Møinichen may have intentionally exaggerated the size of the ship to enhance the Danish victory. A tapestry at Rosenborg Castle shows Kronan as a two-decker with a crown motif that is even larger than Møinichen's painting.|$|E

25|$|Technology {{advances}} {{are opening}} <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion {{people around the}} world who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene. An estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems. Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually.|$|E

It has since proven {{to be one of}} the most popular releases by the group, shipping 8million copies in the United States alone (which has made it 16 times platinum as it is a double album). Physical Graffiti was the first album to go platinum on advance orders alone. Shortly after its release, all previous Led Zeppelin albums simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album chart.|$|E

25|$|Penn fought Diego Sanchez for the UFC Lightweight Championship on December 12, 2009 at UFC 107. Penn negated {{virtually}} any offense from the contender, exercising good footwork and elusive head movement whilst remaining flawless in his takedown defense on 27 attempts from Sanchez. He stalked his opponent for large periods {{of the match}} and stunned Sanchez early, dropping him; following up with multiple clean shots, which Sanchez showed good durability in weathering. Penn, showing good conditioning {{for the duration of}} the bout, continued to stuff all takedowns, punches and left high kicks from Sanchez and dominated with aggressive bursts of striking throughout. He hurt Sanchez several times, until finally rocking him with a flurry in the final round, swarming to finish the combo with a right high kick. The kick opened <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> cut on Sanchez's forehead above his left eye, causing the fight to be halted on doctor's advice at 2:47 of the fifth round with a TKO. The victory marked only the second fight in UFC history to end in the fifth round, and also earned Penn the distinction of being the only man to have stopped Sanchez.|$|E
25|$|Asafa Powell {{opened his}} 2010 season on 20 February at the UWI Invitational Meet in Jamaica, by {{competing}} in the 400m. He won his heat {{in a time of}} 47.56s, but he was placed 3rd overall according to his time. He then ran the 200m at the UTech Classic on 17 April 2010, also in his homeland. He competed in the 200m in heavy rain and cold conditions. Powell opened <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> lead in the first 100m after which he slowed drastically and won his heat in 21.27s in a 1m/s headwind. Later it was reported that Powell had suffered minor cramps on his left calf muscles, which was why he had to slow down. Powell was next scheduled to run in the highly anticipated 4x100m Penn Relays featuring Jamaica Yellow, and competing against Usain Bolt (Jamaica Black). But he pulled out of the race as it was reported by his assistant coach that he had an injured toe which would need some time to heal. At the IAAF Diamond League in Doha, Powell made a wind aided time of 9.75s in the heat and 9.81s in the final,also wind-aided. He subsequently set a 100m world leading time of 9.83s. En route to this performance, he also set the rarely run 100 yards dash world best at 9.07 s, beating the previous record of 9.21 set by Charlie Greene.|$|E

25|$|The 1994 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 48th {{season of}} FIA Formula One motor racing. It {{featured}} the 1994 FIA Formula One World Championship which commenced on 27 March 1994, and ended on 13 November after sixteen races. The season is remembered {{as one of}} the most tragic and controversial seasons in the sport's history. 1994 w{{as one of the}} closest championships in history as Michael Schumacher won the Drivers' title by a single point from Damon Hill after the two controversially collided at the final round in Adelaide. Schumacher had built <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> championship lead, winning six of the first seven races, before two disqualifications and a race ban allowed Hill to close the gap. British constructor Williams-Renault won the Constructors' Championship. However, the 1994 season will also be remembered for the deaths of three-time World Champion Ayrton Senna and Austrian rookie Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix. Forty-six drivers competed in the 1994 World Championship, including fourteen who made their F1 debut and numerous pay drivers. Mercedes-Benz also returned to the sport for the first time since 1955 as an engine supplier to Swiss team, Sauber. The season also saw the first win for Ferrari since 1990 – whilst McLaren failed to win a single race following the departure of Senna, before embarking on a long-term partnership with Mercedes.|$|E

Writing of Werner in Reds: McCarthyism In Twentieth-Century America, Ted Morgan wrote: [...] "Pompous and condescending, he was disliked by lawyers. He had been reversed often by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and he was so inefficient that he had piled <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> backlog of cases." ...|$|E

The media blamed Tatum for his termination. Tatum told Cross to refute Tatum's role in the matter, and threatened to reveal the Oklahoma team had been paid $6,000 after the 1947 Gator Bowl. Cross asked Byrd to persuade Tatum not to go public, and according to author Gary King in An Autumn Remembered, Byrd replied, [...] "Persuade, hell! I'll tell {{him to keep his}} damn mouth shut!"

Smulevich bases the diagnosis of continuous sluggish schizophrenia, in particular, on appearance and lifestyle and stresses that the forefront in the picture of negative changes is given to the contrast between retaining mental activity (and sometimes quite high capacity for work) and mannerism, unusualness of one's appearance and entire lifestyle.|$|E

In the Goodwood Cup on 27 July Tristan started at odds of 1/4 against two moderate opponents, but his winning streak came to an end after his jockey, George Fordham, misjudged the race tactics and allowed a horse named Friday to build <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> lead which he was unable to make up in the straight.
