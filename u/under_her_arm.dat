25|$|The Papillon's {{history and}} long {{association}} with royalty {{have led to}} many stories about the breed. Marie Antoinette {{is said to have}} walked to the guillotine clutching her small dog <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> likely an apocryphal tale. However, tradition has it that Marie Antoinette's dog was a small spaniel that had been brought to the French court from Spain on the back of pack mules. According to the story, her pup was spared and cared for in a building in Paris still called the Papillon House. Marie Antoinette's dog was said to have descended from a very old drop-eared breed known as the Epagneul Nain, or Continental Dwarf/Toy Spaniel that appeared in church frescos and paintings as early as the 13th century.|$|E
500|$|Anne Boleyn was {{beheaded}} in 1536 for treason against Henry VIII; her ghost supposedly haunts {{the chapel}} of St Peter ad Vincula, {{where she is}} buried, and has been said {{to walk around the}} White Tower carrying her head <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm.</b> This haunting is commemorated in the 1934 comic song [...] "With Her Head Tucked Underneath Her Arm". Other reported ghosts include Henry VI, Lady Jane Grey, Margaret Pole, and the Princes in the Tower. In January 1816, a sentry on guard outside the Jewel House claimed to have witnessed an apparition of a bear advancing towards him, and reportedly died of fright a few days later. In October 1817, a tubular, glowing apparition was claimed to have been seen in the Jewel House by the Keeper of the Crown Jewels, Edmund Lenthal Swifte. He said that the apparition hovered over the shoulder of his wife, leading her to exclaim: [...] "Oh, Christ! It has seized me!" [...] Other nameless and formless terrors have been reported, more recently, by night staff at the Tower.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{came and}} {{clustered}} close against {{her as she}} sat on the sofa, and so contrived as to creep in <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm.</b> No one had ever crept in <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> or clung close to her before. Such outward signs of affection as that had never been hers, either to give or to receive.|$|E

6000|$|He {{lifted her}} stiff, cold little {{body from the}} car. His hands <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> he held <b>her</b> on the running-board an instant, her eyes level with his. [...] "Little sister--plucky little sister!" [...] he sighed. He lowered her to the ground.|$|R
50|$|Erikson died {{of cancer}} in 1918. She did not have {{time to go to the}} doctor when she first began feeling pain <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> and by the time she went she had a very {{advanced}} sarcoma. She is buried in Hietaniemi Cemetery in Finland.|$|R
60|$|And {{she had on}} a black bonnet, and a black shawl, and no {{crinoline}} at all; and a pair {{of large}} green spectacles, and a great hooked nose, hooked so much that the bridge of it stood quite up above her eyebrows; and <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> she carried a great birch-rod. Indeed, she was so ugly that Tom was tempted to make faces at her: but did not; for he did not admire the look of the birch-rod <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
60|$|Gerald came {{round as}} {{she was trying to}} capture the flying rabbit <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm.</b> He saw, with subtle recognition, her sullen passion of cruelty.|$|E

6000|$|He led Malleville up to {{the cart}} behind, and putting his hands <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> he said [...] "Jump!" [...] Malleville jumped--Beechnut {{at the same time}} lifting to help her. She did not however quite get up, and so Beechnut let her down to the ground again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me get down," [...] said Lettie, {{lifting her}} hands to him to help her. He, mistaking her wish, put his hands <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> and set <b>her</b> gently down, as one would a child. Leslie got up quickly, and seemed to hold himself separate, resenting the intrusion.|$|R
6000|$|Just as a saucy bronze nymph on {{the mantelpiece}} struck the quarter to three on an elegant clock <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> a visitor was announced--"Mrs. Newsham." ...|$|E

60|$|Sam {{bent over}} the side of the car, put his hands <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> lifted <b>her</b> like a kitten and {{deposited}} her on the seat beside him. Then throwing in the clutch, he drove at an ever increasing speed down the drive and out into the silent road. Strange creatures of the night came and went in the golden glow of the head-lights.|$|R
60|$|With the recoil of her exerted strength, she too reeled, {{staggered}} back, {{and sat on}} {{the edge}} of the bed. Out of breath, but calm and unabashed, she busied herself in readjusting <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> the brown and yellow figured Celebes sarong, the tuck of which had come undone during the fight. Then, folding <b>her</b> bare <b>arms</b> tightly on <b>her</b> breast, she leaned forward on her crossed legs, determined and without fear.|$|R

60|$|It {{took two}} thirty-foot lassos tied {{together}} {{to reach the}} floor of the valley. Shefford folded his vest, put it round Fay, and slipped a loop of the lasso <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b> Then he and Nas Ta Bega lowered her to the grass below. Fay, throwing off the loop, bounded away like a wild creature, uttering the strangest cries he had ever heard, and she disappeared along the wall.|$|R

60|$|She {{hesitated a}} moment; but {{seeing that the}} man {{remained}} motionless, his eyes still covered, as if lost to all his surroundings, she softly crept forward and entered the room. She held the crutches <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> but dared not use them for fear of making a noise. Step by step she stole forward until the table was within reach. Then she stretched out her hand, seized the revolver, and hid it {{in the folds of}} her blouse.|$|R

60|$|With these words, {{clasping}} tightly {{the precious}} little bundle <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> {{she stepped into}} the carriage. Heedless of the risk he ran, sheer admiration sent Stephen to the carriage door.|$|E
