5|$|Scheduling {{was left}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> team. There were wide variations, {{both in the}} overall number of games played and in the number played against other Association members. Thus, no {{official}} standings were maintained. In addition, football teams in the APFA also faced independent football teams not associated with the league. For instance, the Rochester Jeffersons played a schedule consisting mostly of local teams from their local sandlot circuit and the NYPFL, not the APFA.|$|E
5|$|Though {{scheduled}} to participate on three separate occasions, Australia has only contested the Oceania Baseball Championship once in 2003. The two other times, Australia's scheduled opponents—Guam in 2004 and New Zealand in 2007—withdrew from {{competition in the}} lead <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> series, both times {{scheduled to}} be held in Sydney. Australia was awarded the championship both times, and as a result represented Oceania at the 2004 Summer Olympics and at the 2007 Baseball World Cup respectively.|$|E
5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they face <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry {{and they may}} bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing her head on his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E

5|$|Promoted to {{sergeant}} on 28 July, Derrick led a six-man reconnaissance on 3 October, successfully pinpointing several German {{machine gun}} positions and strongholds; {{this information was}} to be vital for the upcoming Second Battle of El Alamein. The El Alamein offensive was launched on 23 October, with the 9th Australian Division taking part. At one point during the engagement, Derrick jumped up onto an Allied gun carrier heading towards the Germans. Armed with a Thompson submachine gun and under intense heavy fire, Derrick attacked and knocked out three machine gun posts while standing in the carrier. He then had the driver reverse <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> post so he could ensure each position was silenced. By the following morning, Derrick's platoon occupied all three posts. The members of the 2/48th Battalion who witnessed Derrick's action were sure he would be awarded the Victoria Cross, though no recommendation was made.|$|E
25|$|This large stork has a dance-like display. A pair stalk <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other face to face, {{extending}} {{their wings}} and fluttering the wing tips rapidly and advancing their heads until they meet.

25|$|The final scene's snowy {{landscape}} was filmed in New Zealand. The ending is deliberately ambiguous, {{and the audience}} is left with several questions: specifically, how much time has passed, if Dae-Su's meeting with the hypnotist really took place, whether he successfully lost the knowledge of Mi-do's identity, and whether he will continue his relationship with Mi-do. In an interview with Park (included with the European release of the film), {{he says that the}} ambiguous ending was deliberate and intended to generate discussion; it is completely <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> individual viewer to interpret what isn't shown.|$|E
25|$|The hull {{was very}} {{similar to that of the}} Rs.II, being short and broad with a cockpit near the nose {{protected}} by a large coaming. Fuel for the engines was housed in a large fuel tank mounted in the hull, which also provided accommodation for the crew when not at their stations. The flight crew usually consisted of two pilots, a commander, and possibly a navigator, with gunners and mechanics to man the guns and engines as well as manually pump fuel <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> engine's gravity tanks.|$|E

They climbed up and down their shafts using either footholes in the shaft walls or stemples, wooden steps built into the sides, an exhausting and dangerous way to start and finish a day's work. These climbing shafts were usually within the miners' “coe”, the limestone-walled cabin in which they stored tools, a change of clothes and food. Where the mine was on a hillside the vein could often be reached via an adit or tunnel driven into the slope.|$|E

25|$|Microsoft Windows, has {{included}} limited PC power management features since Windows 95. These initially provided for stand-by (suspend-to-RAM) and a monitor low power state. Further iterations of Windows added hibernate (suspend-to-disk) {{and support for}} the ACPI standard. Windows 2000 was the first NT-based operating system to include power management. This required major changes to the underlying operating system architecture and a new hardware driver model. Windows 2000 also introduced Group Policy, a technology that allowed administrators to centrally configure most Windows features. However, power management was not one of those features. This is probably because the power management settings design relied upon a connected set of per-user and per-machine binary registry values, effectively leaving it <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> user to configure their own power management settings.|$|E
25|$|Hisame is Shigure's step brother. He {{often gets}} jealous when seeing Shigure and Mami together. On the outside Hisame is bad mannered, {{but on the}} inside he is {{actually}} quite a good boy. He teases Mami but likes her secretly. He felt jealousy when Akira agreed {{to go out with}} Mami and tried to destroy their relationship but failed. Hisame becomes attached to Yukina whenever Mami rejects him. Later on, it is shown that they have warmed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other and Yukina also encourages Hisame's crush on Mami. Hisame recently confessed his love to Mami. After being rejected he turns to Yukina and makes her his toy to play with. He also threatens to tell Shigure about the identity of Yupina (handle name of Yukina). He is secretly Dolche, Yukina's rival in her novel. He shows to have a crush on Yukina although he thinks that he is just replacing Yukina for Mami.|$|E
25|$|Since the 2015–16 season, all American college {{basketball}} uses a 30-second shot clock, while Canadian university basketball uses a 24-second clock. The American women's game has used a 30-second clock since the 1970s, but the men's game did not adopt a shot clock until 1985. The men's limit was originally 45 seconds, and was shortened to 35 seconds in 1993 {{before going to}} 30 seconds in 2015. The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), which sets rules for high school basketball in the U.S., does not mandate {{the use of a}} shot clock, instead leaving the choice to use a clock and its duration <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> individual state association. Proposals to adopt a national shot clock for high school basketball have been voted down by the NFHS as recently as 2011. Currently, eight U.S. states require the use of a shot clock of 30 seconds in high school competition: California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Washington.|$|E

Gradually, they open <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other and reveal their deepest personal secrets: Allison is a compulsive liar; Andrew cannot easily think for himself; Bender {{comes from an}} abusive household; Brian was planning suicide with a flare gun due to the inability {{to cope with a}} bad grade; and Claire is a virgin who feels constant pressure from her friends to be a certain way. They also discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents, which are a key cause for their personal issues as well: Allison's parents ignore her due to their own problems; Andrew's father constantly criticizes his efforts at wrestling and pushes him as hard as possible; Bender's father verbally and physically abuses him; Brian's overbearing parents put immense pressure on him to earn high grades; and Claire's parents use her to get back at each other during frequent arguments. The students realize that, even with their differences, they face similar pressures and complications in their lives.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{propensity}} for heavy fog {{in some parts}} of the British Isles, fog signal rules were established on the UK railway system to keep train traffic moving without incurring the severe delays that would be necessary if drivers had to stop or travel slowly <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> signal and read its indication. During heavy fog, fogsignalmen would be stationed at distant signals with a lantern and detonators – small explosive charges that could be strapped to the rail to be exploded by the wheels of a train. The fogsignalman's duty was to repeat the indication of the signal using his lantern; the semaphore arm was usually obscured by fog and hence invisible to the driver of a moving train. If the distant signal were displaying 'caution' (warning that a signal ahead was at 'danger'), the detonators remained on the rail and the fogsignalman would show a yellow lamp to show 'caution'; if the distant signal were clear, the detonators would be removed from the rails and a green lamp would be displayed.|$|E
25|$|In series 10, {{the format}} to Bootcamp was changed: the judges find out their {{categories}} before Bootcamp starts, and each judge will {{make decisions on}} who is performing in the Six-Chair Challenge by eliminating the contestants, this is <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> individual judge. From Series 11 onwards, the judges do not know their categories before the Bootcamp, {{so they have to}} make the decisions together. After the Bootcamp round, the mentor challenges their contestants through the Six-Chair Challenge. Judges make decisions on who to put through to judges' houses straight after each act has performed, with those getting a yes taking a chair in the final six chairs on stage. It is up to the mentor to decide, which act they want to take to judges' houses, but once all six spots are full, if the mentor wants to send another act through to the next stage it means they have to replace one of those who were previously given a yes. This format was very poorly rated by many members of the British public. Bootcamp still took place, but only highlights were shown in the first episode of the Six-chair challenge. In series 12, all of Bootcamp aired on-screen. A more brutal twist to the Six-Chair Challenge was introduced in series 14, where the mentor is to sit at a smaller table {{at the side of the}} arena while making the decisions, while the other judges remain at a larger table on the other side.|$|E
