6000|$|Nessudikira, {{whose eyes}} {{by way of}} {{grandeur}} never wandered from the floor, shook hands with us without rising from his chair, somewhat after the fashion of certain women in civilized society, who would be dignified, and who are not. His father, Gidi Mavunga, knelt before him on the ground, a mat being forbidden in the presence: he made the [...] "batta-palmas" [...] before he addressed his [...] "filho de pistola," [...] as he called him, in opposition to filho de fazenda. The [...] "king" [...] had lately been crowned in virtue of his mother being a <b>uterine</b> <b>sister</b> of his predecessor. Here the goods and dignity of the father revert after death to his eldest maternal brother; to his eldest nephew, that is, the eldest son of the eldest <b>uterine</b> <b>sister,</b> and, all others failing, to the first born of the nearest maternal relative. This subjection of sire to son is, however, mainly ceremonious: in private life the king wears a cotton pagne, and his [...] "governor" [...] asserts his birth- right even by wigging royalty.|$|R
50|$|On January 7, 1640, Jean Boyer {{bought a}} house in Wissous, south of Paris. He married Jeanne Aymar (widow of Jacques de Mézières) in February 1644. He had a sister, Marguerite, married to François Gaulthier, {{prosecutor}} in Parliament, a brother Léon, equerry, councilor of the king and inspector of the wars, and a <b>uterine</b> <b>sister</b> Suzanne Maugars, wife of Jean Bigot, a lawyer in parliament. Perhaps the latter was of the family of André Maugars (circa 1580 - circa 1645), a famous violist.|$|R
50|$|The Qur'an {{introduced}} {{a number of}} different rights and restrictions on matters of inheritance, including general improvements to the treatment of women and family life. The Qur'an also presented efforts to fix the laws of inheritance, and thus forming a complete legal system. This development was in contrast to pre-Islamic societies where rules of inheritance varied considerably. Furthermore, the Qur'an {{introduced a}}dditional heirs that were not entitled inheritance in pre-Islamic times, mentioning nine relatives specifically of which six were female and three were male. The laws of inheritance in the Qur'an also included other male relatives, like the husband and half-brothers from the mother’s side, which were excluded from inheritance in old customs. The heirs mentioned in the Qur'an are the mother, father, husband, wife, daughter, <b>uterine</b> brother, full <b>sister,</b> <b>uterine</b> <b>sister,</b> and consanguine sister.|$|R
50|$|Burislev, Richeza's son by Sverker I, is {{sometimes}} identified with Burislev, a rival claimant to the Swedish throne against Canute I after 1167. He acted {{in concert with}} another pretender Kol, but was defeated and eliminated, according to a much later source in 1169. He is believed either to have been slain by Canute I's men or to have fled to Denmark or Poland some time before 1173. However, medieval Swedish genealogies say that the claimants Kol and Burislev were in fact sons of John, a son of Sverker and Ulvhild. If so, the younger Burislev was given the prestigious name after his grandfather's second marriage without actually being related to Bolesław III. The only thing we know about Richeza's son Burislev is that his goods were inherited by his <b>uterine</b> <b>sister</b> Sophia of Minsk.|$|R
5000|$|... "When Alaric {{was near}} Rome, besieging its inhabitants, the senate {{suspected}} Serena {{of bringing the}} Barbarians against their city. The whole senate therefore, with Placidia, <b>uterine</b> <b>sister</b> to the emperor, thought it proper that she should suffer death, for being {{the cause of the}} present calamity. They observed, that [...] "Alaric, upon Serena being removed, will retire from the city, because no person will remain by whom he can hope the town to be betrayed into his hands." [...] This suspicion was in reality groundless, as Serena never had any such intentions. ... However, the death of Serena did not remove Alaric from the siege, but he blocked up the gates all round, and having possessed himself of the river Tiber, prevented the arrival of necessaries from the port to the city".|$|R
50|$|In Islam, {{women are}} {{entitled}} {{the right of}} inheritance. In general circumstances, though not all, Islam allots women half the share of inheritance available to men who have {{the same degree of}} relation to the decedent. For example, where the decedent has both male and female children, a son's share is double that of a daughter's. Additionally, the sister of a childless man inherits half of his property upon his death, while a brother of a childless woman inherits all of her property. However, this principle is not universally applicable, and there are other circumstances where women might receive equal shares to men. For example, the share of the mother and father of a decedent who leaves children behind. Also the share of a uterine brother is equal to the share of a <b>uterine</b> <b>sister,</b> as do the shares of their descendants.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{disturbances}} {{that followed}} the fall of Stilicho, throughout the Italian Peninsula the wives and children of the foederati were slain. The foederati were considered loyalists of Stilicho and treated accordingly. The natural consequence of all this was that these men, {{to the number of}} 30,000, flocked to the camp of Alaric I, King of the Visigoths, clamouring to be led against their cowardly enemies. Alaric accordingly led them across the Julian Alps and, in September 408, stood before the Aurelian Walls and began a strict blockade. Rome was under siege, with minor interruptions, from 408 to August 24, 410. Zosimus records that Placidia was within the city during the siege. When Serena was accused of conspiring with Alaric, [...] "the whole senate therefore, with Placidia, <b>uterine</b> <b>sister</b> to the emperor, thought it proper that she should suffer death". Her reasons for concurring to the execution of her cousin are not stated in the account.|$|R
60|$|How far Aristotle was {{justified}} in regarding {{the family as}} the ultimate unit, with the materials afforded to him by Greek literature, I have already noticed. Besides, Aristotle, I may remark, had he reflected {{on the meaning of}} that Athenian law which, while prohibiting marriage with a <b>uterine</b> <b>sister,</b> permitted it with a sister-german, or on the common tradition in Athens that before the time of Cecrops children bore their mothers' names, or on some of the Spartan regulations, could hardly have failed to see the universality of kinsmanship through women in early days, and the late appearance of monandry. Yet, while he missed this point, in common, it must be acknowledged, with many modern writers, such as Sir Henry Maine, it is essentially as an explorer of inductive instances that we recognise his improvement on Plato. The treatise [Greek text which cannot be reproduced], did it remain to us in its entirety, would {{have been one of the}} most valuable landmarks in the progress of historical criticism, and the first scientific treatise on the science of comparative politics.|$|R
50|$|Among {{his other}} {{research}} into digit ratio, Hurd has demonstrated that, {{while there is}} no difference in digit ratio between the sexes in most laboratory mice, that pups which gested next to brothers have higher digit ratios than those whose <b>uterine</b> neighbours were <b>sisters,</b> and that the large differences in digit ratios between populations may be explained by Allen's rule and Bergmann's rule.|$|R
40|$|Ivory caskets {{from the}} Andalusian Caliphate {{housed in the}} Instituto de Valencia de Don Juan and Santa Maria de Fitero's church, were worked for the same personage as their inscriptions, in Kufic alphabet, prove. Scholars have {{interpreted}} those passages in quite different ways though the most credited lectures are Lévi-Provençal's - who identified the personage with Ṣubḥ, concubine of al-Ḥakam II and mother of Hiﬞsām II - and Ferrandis' and Kühnel's - both of them read in the inscription «to the beloved Wallāda » —although they did not identify the personage-. &# 13; Nevertheless, the philological analysis of those inscriptions underlying the interpretation made by Manuel Ocaña Jiménez and the existing historical sources, confirm the hypothesis of those luxury objects being worked for {{another member of the}} court, the <b>uterine</b> <b>sister</b> of al-Ḥakam II, Wallāda. Las arquillas de marfil de época califal que se conservan en el Instituto de Valencia de Don Juan y en la iglesia de Santa María de Fitero se labraron para el mismo personaje de la corte de al-akam II, tal y como se evidencia de la dedicatoria escrita con grafía cúfica. Varios especialistas interpretaron el pasaje en cuestión de distintas maneras, siendo las lecturas que acabaron por gozar de mayor crédito la de E. Lévi-Provençal —quien identificó el personaje con Ṣubḥ, concubina de al-Ḥakam II y madre de Hiﬞsām II— y la de J. Ferrandis y E. Kühnel —quienes leyeron en la dedicatoria «para la queridísima Wallāda», aunque sin identificar al personaje. &# 13; No obstante, el estudio filológico de la inscripción en la base de la interpretación de Manuel Ocaña Jiménez, junto al testimonio de las fuentes históricas confirman la hipótesis de que los objetos suntuarios en realidad se hicieron para la hermana uterina de al-Ḥakam II, Wallāda...|$|R
50|$|By {{his wife}} Euphemia Douglas eldest {{daughter}} of Sir Robert Douglas of Lochleven, and <b>sister</b> <b>uterine</b> of the Regent Moray, {{he had a}} son, James, 7th Lord Lindsay, and two daughters: Margaret, married to James Leslie, Master of Rothes, and Maulslie, married to William Ballingall of Ballingull. James Lindsay, 7th Lord Lindsay (d. 1601), like his father, was a zealous supporter of Protestantism. He was chiefly responsible for the Protestant tumult in the Tolbooth, 17 Dec. 1596, and was fined in large sums of money. He died 5 Nov. 1601, By his wife Euphemia Leslie, eldest daughter of Andrew, fifth earl of Rothes, he bad two sons — John, eighth lord, and Robert, ninth lord — and three daughters: Jean, married to Rohert Lundin of Balgony; Catherine, married to John Lundin of Lundin; and Helen, married to John, second lord Cranston.|$|R
60|$|Besides, was he not {{accounted}} a great {{god in the}} land? supreme? having {{power of}} life and death? essaying the deposition of kings? and dwelling in moody state, all by himself, in the goodliest island of Mardi? Though here, be it said, that his assumptions of temporal supremacy were but seldom made good by express interference with the secular concerns of the neighboring monarchs; who, by force of arms, were too apt to argue against his claims to authority; however, in theory, they bowed to it. And now, for the genealogy of Hivohitee; for eighteen hundred and forty-seven Hivohitees were alleged to have gone before him. He came in a right line from the divine Hivohitee I.: the original grantee of the empire of men's souls and the first swayer of a crosier. The present Pontiff's descent was unquestionable; his dignity having been transmitted through none but heirs male; the whole procession of High Priests being the fruit of successive marriages between <b>uterine</b> brother and <b>sister.</b> A conjunction deemed incestuous in some lands; but, here, held the only fit channel for the pure transmission of elevated rank.|$|R
60|$|Traces of the totem {{among the}} Greek [Greek] are, naturally, few. Almost all the known [Greek] bore patronymics derived from {{personal}} names. But {{it is not}} without significance that the Attic demes often adopted the names of obsolescent [Greek], and that those names were, as Mr. Grote says, often 'derived from the plants and shrubs which grew in their neighbourhood.' We have already seen {{that at least one}} Attic [Greek], the Ioxidae, revered the plant from which they derived their lineage. One thing is certain, the totem names, and a common explanation of the totem names in Australia, correspond with the names and Mr. Grote's explanation of the names of the Attic demes. 'One origin of family names,' says Sir George Grey (ii. 228), 'frequently ascribed by the natives, is that they were derived from some vegetable or animal being common in the district which the family inhabited.' Some writers attempt to show that the Attic [Greek] was once exogamous and counted kin on the mother's side, by quoting the custom which permitted a man to marry his half-sister, the child of his father but not of his mother. They infer that this permission is a survival from the time when a man's father's children were not reckoned as his kindred, and when kinship was counted through mothers. Sir Henry Maine (p. 105) prefers M. Fustel De Coulanges' theory, that the marriage of half-brothers and sisters on the father's side was intended to save the portion of the girl to the family estate. Proof of this may be adduced from examination of all the recorded cases of such marriages in Athens. But the reason thus suggested would have equally justified marriage between brothers and sisters on both sides, and this was reckoned incest. A well-known line in Aristophanes shows how intense was Athenian feeling about the impiety of relations with a <b>sister</b> <b>uterine.</b>|$|R
