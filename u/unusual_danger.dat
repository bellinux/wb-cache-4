60|$|Instinct, {{in cases}} of sudden and <b>unusual</b> <b>danger</b> must do the office of reason. There was no {{necessity}} to warn the unthinking but panic-struck crowd {{to provide for their}} own safety, for every man in the centre of the barge threw his body flaon the deck, and grasped the cords that Maso had taken care to provide for that purpose, with the tenacity with which all who possess life cling to the means of existence. The dogs gave beautiful proofs of the secret and wonderful means that nature has imparted, to answer the ends of their creation. Old Uberto crouched, cowering, and oppressed with a sense of helplessness, at the side of his master, while the Newfoundland follower of the mariner went leaping from gangway to gangway, snuffing the heated air, and barking wildly, as if he would challenge the elements to close for the strife.|$|E

5000|$|Technically, the isha katlanit rule {{may still}} be valid for those who adhere to Orthodox Judaism. As a {{practical}} matter, however, rabbinic authorities have substantially curtailed {{the relevance of the}} principles, thanks partly to the rabbinic principle of [...] "The Lord protects the simple" [...] from <b>unusual</b> <b>dangers.</b> In addition, rabbinic authorities have expressed in responsa their concern that widows be allowed to remarry, both for their own moral benefit {{and for the sake of}} the Jewish population. Today it is accepted that deaths of old husbands (over age 70) or deaths of husbands caused by an obvious accident are not reasons to define a woman as a katlanit. Unnatural causes, though, may activate the rule.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that there is an underlying political revolution in educational governance. Furtheraore, {{there is a need for}} concern with the changes needed in the roles of researchers and state policy level policy makers in order for research to play a significant part in helping shape refora in education. Given the present political conditions there are <b>unusual</b> <b>dangers</b> for researchers trying to serve state policy makers. The initiative for educational changes has shifted from the local district to the national government and subsequently to state leadership. The legislative patterns of recent years have increased further the separation between respcnsibility and operation. Increased centralization at the state level is combined with the creation of multiple new points of access in educational governments ranging from teacher negotiations to site level parent advisor...|$|R

[...] However the event was reported to London merely as the commonplace capture of a slaver and hence merited no reward, a fact that Cumming resented for the rest of his life. [...] Instead all he received was a period of quarantine, followed by an attack of smallpox and a long convalescence in England. [...] Cumming remained nominally with Frolic until 21 October 1843.|$|R

"Moreover, {{that nothing}} may be wanting to {{complete}} the romance of this gorge, there looms above it, at a dizzy height, Schloss Karneid - one of the mediæval castles which play so prominent a rôle in both the scenery and history of Tirol. All of these strongholds have their interesting records of achievement - some of them chivalrous, most of them cruel, all of them remarkable. Karneid for example, was {{the home of the}} Lichtensteins, who ranked already at the commencement of the 12th Century among the strongest of the Tirolean families. In the great struggle for supremacy that arose between the Hapsburg Archduke Frederick ('Friedl of the Empty Pockets') and the ambitious nobles of the Tirol, the masters of this fortress where the formers bitterest foes, and if an undertaking of <b>unusual</b> <b>danger</b> was ever demanded in that arduous strife, the Lichtensteins were always ready to attempt it. In the fact, the name 'A Lichtenstein' was synonymous with one who then sought absolute independence form the archduke's sovereignty. Accordingly, in 1409, Frederick laid siege to Karneid with a powerful army, captured it finally by storm, and dragged its owners into captivity. Nor were they set at liberty until Oswald von Wolkenstein - Minnesinger, warrior and the soul of the rebellion - secured their freedom by a heavy ransom. In 1760 Count Anton von Lichtenstein, the last of his race, died in his ancient stronghold, which then came into possession of the city of Botzen. But it was speedily sold by the municipality and is now the property of a wealthy and artistic citizen of Munich." ...|$|E
40|$|The reticence of Canadian {{courts to}} substantively develop tort law beyond the ambit of English precedent, {{coupled with a}} {{conservative}} legislative approach, has often left Canadian tort law looking more English than the English. What is needed, then, is for more Canadian judges to adopt the audacious approach demonstrated by Justice Roach in Atkinson v. Fleming. On the other hand, tort law may soon be rendered superfluous by burgeoning social welfare legislation, changing insurance practices and other institutional alterations. Allen M. Linden explores <b>unusual</b> <b>danger,</b> product liability and automobile accident compensation, three important areas of personal injury law, in light of competing winds of change that will either galvanise or desiccate Canadian tort law...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} closed access. A {{rational}} approach to formwork design based on simplified assumptions and approximate beam formulas is sufficiently adequate when designing formwork subjected to light loads. A detailed structural design {{may be required}} for extremely heavy loadings, or where there is <b>unusual</b> <b>danger</b> to life or property. A detailed mathematical model for the analysis and design of formwork assemblies encountered in practice is developed in this paper. The requirements for the detailed mathematical model are presented. The stiffness method of analysis of structural systems is used for formulating the mathematical model. The use of existing software for solving the stiffness equations is assessed. A conceptual model for implementing the stiffness method in formwork design is proposed. This is used to develop the detailed formwork design program. The program's capabilities are finally illustrated {{by means of a}} case study example...|$|E

Under the old system of Remplacement, the Belgian army was a combination of volunteers and a lottery, and it was possible for men to pay for substitutes for service. This was replaced by a system in which one son in every family would have to serve in the military.|$|R
40|$|These two {{personal}} accounts contain {{key aspects of}} paranoia: the individuals are making judgements about other people; the decision-making is influenced by fear, worry, and <b>unusual</b> 'feelings'; and <b>danger</b> is anticipated. This is consistent with an emerging body of psychological research that implicates-in {{the context of the}} social world-reasoning processes, negative affect, and anomalous internal experiences in the occurrence of delusions. In this chapter the advances in the cognitive and social understanding of psychosis will be illustrated with reference to the clinically important experience of persecutory delusions, where arguably the progress has been most rapid. The initial application of this theoretical knowledge to clinical practice via an interventionist causal model approach will be described. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010...|$|R

The landing-bell was rung at four o'clock, as the tide suited at that early hour, but the men were so fatigued that they would gladly have slept some hours longer. This, however, the nature of the service would not admit of. The building of the Bell Rock Lighthouse was a peculiar service. It may be said to have resembled duty in the trenches in military warfare. At times the work was light enough, {{but for the most part}} it was severe and irregular, as the men had to work in all kinds of weather, as long as possible, in the face of <b>unusual</b> difficulties and <b>dangers,</b> and were liable to be called out at all unseasonable hours.

5000|$|It was {{discovered}} on 8 January 2011 by the Mt. Lemmon Survey at an apparent magnitude of 19.6 using a 1.52 m reflecting telescope. Pan-STARRS precovery images from 8 November 2010 extended the observation arc to 317 days. Observations by the Gemini 8.2 m telescope at Mauna Kea recovered the asteroid on October 20, 21 and 27, 2012, and extended the observation arc to 719 days. The October 2012 observations {{have reduced the}} orbit uncertainties {{by more than a}} factor of 60, meaning that the Earth's position in February 2040 no longer falls within the range of possible future paths for the asteroid. On 4 February 2040 the asteroid will pass no closer than [...] (~2.3 LD) from Earth. Until 21 December 2012 it was listed on the Sentry Risk Table with a rating on the Torino Scale of Level 1. A Torino rating of 1 is a routine discovery in which a pass near the Earth is predicted that poses no <b>unusual</b> level of <b>danger.</b> It is estimated that an impact would produce the equivalent of 100 megatons of TNT, roughly twice that of the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated (Tsar Bomba). This is powerful enough to damage a region at least a hundred miles wide.|$|R
