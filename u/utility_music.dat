MM wrote that Warm Guns performed just as easy, fast and determined as many English rock bands, and that the action and catchiness promised in the album title were evident {{in many of the}} songs - [...] "The Young Go First", [...] "Under My Skin" [...] and [...] "Shiny Shoes" [...] - because of their semi-familiar melodies - [...] "I’ll Get You", [...] "She’s A Go Go Getter" [...] and [...] "Back In The 80′s", due to the band's aggression and dynamic energy.|$|E
50|$|Dessau {{composed}} operas, scenic plays, incidental music, ballets, symphonies {{and other}} works for orchestra, and pieces for solo instruments {{as well as}} vocal music. From the 1920s on, he was fascinated by film music. He composed music for early movies of Walt Disney, as well as background music for silent pictures and early German films. While in exile in Paris he wrote the oratorio Hagadah shel Pessach after a libretto by Max Brod. In the 1950s in collaboration with Bertolt Brecht he focused on the musical theatre. During that time several of his operas were produced. He also wrote Gebrauchsmusik (<b>utility</b> <b>music)</b> for the propaganda of the German Democratic Republic. At {{the same time he}} lobbied for the musical avant-garde (e.g. Witold Lutosławski, Alfred Schnittke, Boris Blacher, Hans Werner Henze and Luigi Nono).|$|E

40|$|Empathy {{plays a role}} {{in social}} {{competence}} and intelligence, and can serve as a buffer against antisocial tendencies. Numerous studies highlight the relationship between empathy, prosocial behaviors, and the predictive <b>utility</b> of <b>music</b> preferences. This study examined participant differences in music preferences and empathy as a function of age, and whether preferred music genre predicted empathy (as a correlate to prosocial behavior). A new measure was devised to assess music preferences more accurately (i. e. with better face/construct validity) than existing measures. The Basic Empathy Scale measured empathy as a multidimensional construct. Younger participants exhibited greater empathy than older ones. Each music preference factor contributed uniquely to empathy variance in multiple regression models. Younger and older participants differed on music preferences (arguably associated with age-related sociocultural influences). Conclusions were drawn regarding the age differences in empathy and music preferences, the systematically greater influences of music preferences on cognitive compared to affective empathy, and the greater associations with empathy of specific music preferences. Limitations and implications for government policy and further research are considered...|$|R
5000|$|Two years later, also {{discussing}} the 17th-century suite (in Beiträge zur Stilgeschichte der deutschen Suite im 17. Jahrhundert, his dissertation of 1923), Heinrich Besseler went a step further, {{to imply that}} such <b>utility</b> <b>music</b> was socially superior, if not artistically so. For Besseler, [...] "aesthetic access" [...] (...) to the dance music was gained through participation, be it playing, dancing, or even singing along, rather than mere listening. He further expounded this thesis in a 1925 article on motets of the Medieval period, in which he proposed that such works had not been designed for the enjoyment of listeners, but with only their devotional purpose in mind; this purpose would only be fulfilled through participation, whether performance or prayer. In making this point, Besseler sought to divide all music into two distinct categories, continuing {{to use the word}} Gebrauchsmusik for one, and likening this to vernacular language, while replacing Nettl's word for the other with eigenständige Musik - alone-standing, or autonomous music. Besseler had studied philosophy with Martin Heidegger, and thought that this musical duality reflected Heidegger's between [...] "thing" [...] and [...] "equipment", for the autonomous and the specific-purposed, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|A second reason, though, {{for this}} {{discredit}} was the occurrence to certain composers and their followers that composing music for large-scale public use {{would lead to}} a need for them to pander as well to large-scale public taste. Such a concept was anathematic to the art-for-arts-sake ideal which followed alongside that of community music in Germany since the days of Beethoven, who had ushered in the era of the well-regarded and financially successful free-lance composer. Schoenberg wrote to the effect that Gebrauchsmusik would hardly out-live its present-day application, while that composed for art and no other purpose would have the only chance at immortality. Schoenberg also noted that there had been less and less call for such <b>utility</b> <b>music</b> {{since the end of the}} Republic anyway, and certainly since the conclusion of the war. As a result of this, Gebrauchsmusiks most ardent promoters had again become [...] "ideal artists". (Schoenberg, Style and Idea, 1950). Earlier (articles of 1924 and 1932), the critic Theodor Adorno had called the work of Hindemith and other Gebrauchsmusiker symptomatic of [...] "false social consciousness", and condemned it as being not truly useful at all, due to what he considered its lack of emotional content. By the late 1950s, Gebrauchsmusik had become almost universally a term of insult, especially among composers. No less than Hindemith attempted, somewhat, to back away from it, when in a lecture at Harvard in 1950, he said that [...] "quite obviously music for which no use can be found, that is to say, useless music, is not entitled to public consideration anyway and consequently the Gebrauch is taken for granted", and also that [...] "up to this day it has been impossible to kill the silly term and the unscrupulous classification that goes with it."

40|$|In {{response}} to increased {{focus on the}} protection of intangible cultural heritage across the world, Music Endangerment offers a new practical approach to assessing, advocating, and assisting the sustainability of musical genres. Drawing upon relevant ethnomusicological research on globalization and musical diversity, musical change, music revivals, and ecological models for sustainability, author Catherine Grant systematically critiques strategies that are currently employed to support endangered musics. She then constructs a comparative framework between language and music, adapting and applying the measures of language endangerment as developed by UNESCO, {{in order to identify}} ways in which language maintenance might (and might not) illuminate new pathways to keeping these musics strong. Grant's work presents the first in-depth, standardized, replicable tool for gauging the level of vitality of music genres, providing an invaluable resource for the creation and maintenance of international cultural policy. It will enable those working in the field to effectively demonstrate the degree to which outside intervention could be of tangible benefit to communities whose musical practices are under threat. Significant for both its insight and its <b>utility,</b> <b>Music</b> Endangerment is an important contribution to the growing field of applied ethnomusicology, and will help secure the continued diversity of our global musical traditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} tempo feature {{extraction}} method {{based on the}} long-term modulation spectrum analysis. To transform the modulation spectrum to a condensed feature vector, the log-scale modulation frequency coefficients are introduced.

To verify the effectiveness of the feature and its <b>utility</b> to <b>music</b> applications, the feature vector is used in a music emotion classification system. The system consisting two layers of Adaboost classifiers. In the first layer the conventional timbre features are employed. Then by adding the tempo feature in the second layer, the classification precision is improved dramatically. By this way the discriminability of the classifier based on the given features can be exploited extremely. The system obtains high classification precision on a small corpus. It proves that the proposed feature is very effective and computationally efficient to characterize the tempo information of music. 1...|$|R

40|$|The <b>utility</b> of <b>music</b> as a {{therapeutic}} intervention {{for individuals with}} intellectual disabilities has been widely discussed (Aldridge, 1993; Schalkwijk, 1995; Wigram, 1995). However, although an extensive literature exists which advocates music as {{a therapeutic}} intervention {{for a wide variety}} of populations, there is a need for empirical evaluation (Maranto, 1991; Radhakishnan, 1991; Purdie, 1997). This paper presents a study investigating the effects of structured music workshops for individuals with intellectual disabilities. A random sample of 60 individuals voluntarily participated in this research. All participants were assessed using a variety of previously validated techniques and techniques designed and validated for use in this study. An experimental group (N = 19) participated in a ten-week music programme. In comparison with a non-intervention control group (N = 16) and an intervention control group (N = 24), results indicated significant improvements in musical ability, communication and self-perception of musical ability for participants in the experimental group. A longitudinal investigation (N = 12) indicated that the developments made by the experimental group remained six months following the intervention. It is suggested that musical activities may provide an environment that facilitates skill development for individuals with intellectual disabilities.

Qualified music therapists have provided interventions to assist physical rehabilitation for over 20 years, however effectiveness of interventions are often questioned. This systematic literature review explores the effectiveness of music therapy (MT) in physical rehabilitation, the function of music {{and the role of}} the music therapist. The following databases were searched: Embase, Cinahl, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Cochrane Review, PsychInfo, Eric, Medline, Dissertation Abstracts and Voices. Research articles were selected if a MT technique was applied towards physical rehabilitation of those experiencing physical impairments. Consistent positive and significant results were found in MT methods in rehabilitation of most gait parameters, and fine and gross motor functioning. The <b>utility</b> of <b>music</b> included increasing motivation, providing an external timekeeper, and providing purposeful and structured rehabilitation interventions. Music therapists were employed to engage patients through music interventions such as instrumental tuition; assess behaviours; adapt interventions according to behaviours; and to provide physical support. These findings suggest that MT enhances physical, psychological, cognitive and emotional functioning within physical rehabilitation. These findings were compared with Staum 2 ̆ 7 s (2000) findings in her analysis of music based physical rehabilitation literature from 1950 - 1999. However, further research is necessary to explore the role of MT interventions in current standard rehabilitation services. © 2011 The Grieg Academy Music Therapy Research Centre...|$|R
40|$|This {{course is}} aimed at {{advanced}} graduate students and is intended as an introduction to queer theory in its application to historical musicology and the theoretical literature, which attempts to address issues of queer theory within the Western Musical Canon. While the important work of integrating queer composers and musicians into the Western art-music canon continues to move apace and to make itself heard and felt in classrooms and textbooks, we cannot afford to ignore the socio-historical conditions that led to such {{a long period of}} neglect. This course will therefore not be a queer history of music but rather will examine the enduring <b>utility</b> of approaching <b>music</b> from a queer perspective. Considering music as both a process and a product, some of the questions this course will address include among others: • Does music possess a content beyond its purely musical syntax and structure or does it imitate action and experience? • Can a composer’s queerness be detected in his/her music? • Does a queer listener hear, or interpret, differently the compositions of a queer composer...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to present the {{therapeutic}} properties of music {{and its effect on}} both mental and physical illness, throughout the centuries as it is presented in published studies. Six articles from the international bibliography and fourteen articles from the Greek bibliography are reviewed in order to present the <b>utility</b> of <b>music</b> as a therapeutic method through the centuries and as an alternative healing method of nowadays. Ancient Greeks used refrains for the healing of men and animals and to prevent difficult and disastrous weather phenomena. Egyptians used to believe that musical notes hold magical powers. In African culture; music has an important role in healing ceremonies. According to the ideology of Greek philosophers the aim of healing is to restore the disturbed balance between body and soul. In classical ages, as Harmidis says, the treatment of headache is consists of the using of leaves from a certain plant in combination with specific refrains. Without chanting those refrains the medicine is useless. We are informed by the writing of Seneca that Maecena used music to eliminate fear so as to fall asleep. In Renaissance, the era of conquers and philosophy, art and science, medicine was renewed and sow as music which gained human experienced basis and ability to express. In Islam, the dominant belief is that body is the house of soul and therefore the body will keep on complaining until the soul is healed. By the 20 th century scientists have neither observed nor studied the effect of music in physiological parameters in the human body. In 1950, the American Society of Music Therapy was founded and so it formed the first center of clinical implementation and research of music therapy...|$|R
40|$|Drivers {{engage in}} a host of driving-unrelated tasks while on the road. Most frequently, drivers listen to music and sing-along with the words in a karaoke fashion. At times drivers {{accompany}} songs by pounding-out drum-kicks, fingering guitar-licks, singing background, and even dancing in their seat. However, there is controversy over in-cabin music: Does background music facilitate driver performance via increased arousal leading to more focused concentration, or cause distraction placing drivers at greater risk. In an effort to shed light on the debate over the <b>utility</b> of in-car <b>music,</b> the current study explored how driving tasks might subsequently affect vocal performances during simulated driving. Eighteen young drivers recorded two versions of two songs (baseline vs. low-demand vs. high-demand driving). The results indicate that as the perceptual demands of the primary driving task increase, the performance of the secondary activity (i. e., karaoke-like singing) declines. That is, vocal performances during high-demand driving contained significantly more errors of both intonation/rhythm and lyrics compared to low-demand driving, while both were far less accurate than baseline recordings. Such a picture supports evidence that engaging in music activity does actually preoccupy vital mental resources. In-car music may not necessarily be handled very well, nor is it blocked-out entirely by drivers during high-demand driving – as previously reported in some literature. Singing along with in-cabin music background may contribute to increased risk for incidents, events, and near-crashes, and should be reconsidered by traffic scientists investigating human factors, vehicular control, and road safety...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} body of research {{evidence to support the}} use of music as a therapeutic modality in reducing the agitated behaviour frequently associated with late-stage dementia. Although much of this evidence suggests that music interventions are most effective when they are “individualized”, this type of intervention is often difficult to implement in large, busy, aged care facilities where residents may be located together in communal areas during the day. The challenge therefore is to try and identify a particular musical genre which, when played as “ambient” or “background” music, demonstrates a consistent capacity to reduce agitated behaviour in late-stage dementia across resident populations in multiple facilities. This study was designed to test the comparative utility of three different types of background music identified in the existing research literature as being of possible benefit in this context. These three types of music were: gentle classical music, familiar music and baroque music. Using a sample of 65 older people with late-stage dementia living in a total of eight residential aged care facilities, this quasi-experimental study used quantitative measures to assess a specific range of agitated behaviours over a one week intervention period. The specific agitated behaviours were documented using the Scale for the Observation of Agitation in Persons with Dementia (SOAP-D) scale (Hurley, Volicer, Camberg, Ashley, Woods, Odenheimer, Ooi, McIntyre, 2 ̆ 6 Mahoney, 1999). In addition, the Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-AD) tool (Logsdon, 1999) was used to collect collateral information from family members or experienced care staff at each of the participating facilities about whether they perceived that the playing of music exerted any influence on {{the quality of life of}} participants. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five experimental subgroups of equal size. Participants in three of the five groups received exposure to audio recordings of music. Participants in one of the two remaining sub-groups were exposed to a non-musical intervention (audio recordings of storybooks) at the same time of day as the participants in the three music groups. Data relating to behaviour and perceived quality of life were recorded in the same manner for this group. The final group of participants acted as the control group for the study. Quantitative data were collected in the same manner for this group: however, they were exposed to no intervention. In addition, a series of structured interviews was undertaken with experienced care providers at each of the participating residential aged care facilities. The purpose of this procedure was to determine whether the experiences and subjective opinions of staff regarding the <b>utility</b> of <b>music</b> as an intervention to settle agitated behaviour in late-stage dementia and improve quality of life were consistent with the observational data recorded using the SOAP-D scale in conjunction with the proxy-rated QoL-AD scale. Results of the study indicated that overall levels of agitated behaviour were less within the three groups exposed to music compared with the nonmusic intervention group and the control. However, perceived quality of life was not measurably improved in any of the three music intervention groups. This study supports the continued use of music as a therapeutic intervention in the management of maladaptive behaviour associated with late-stage dementia, although the results do not support the preferential use of any of the three selected music forms...|$|R
40|$|Many {{people love}} opera. Far many more find it utterly absurd. For the latter, {{the idea that}} there exists a form of {{dramatic}} entertainment that utilizes all the trappings of the theatre – the sets and costumes, the make-up and lighting – but in which all the dialogue is sung, beggars belief. The purpose of this commentary is to set down the contemplations of a composer who, no less bemused than most by the matter, has attempted better to understand the operatic proposition by writing one for himself. As varied as such contemplations have been, a systematic approach has been adopted in the present document, categorizing identifiably discrete areas for consideration, but moving always towards the alliance of all such elements in the multidisciplinary form under scrutiny. Reference is made throughout, {{to a wide range of}} works from many disciplines in the hope both of clarifying and invigorating the account. It was, however, considered indispensable to an honest appraisal of the subject at hand, that two areas of concern to the author be aired at the outset. The first of these relates to questions regarding the <b>utility</b> of <b>music</b> and the belief, expressed herein, that such evaluation is quite inappropriate. The second relates to the belief, equally strongly held, that a good deal of musical critique is deleterious to the understanding and enjoyment of music. The commentary proper gets under way with a discussion of the nature of music itself – whether it is a language, and if not, then what? – whether it has meaning, and if so, then by what means? The discussion then moves on to the world of words and the consideration of language in everyday usage, and then in the area of linguistic art. The focus of this passage moves from the general, to the specifics of language as drama, this area seeming to offer the most advantageous comparison with music. Poetry is touched upon lightly. The field of incidental music is taken up as the first meeting point between words and music by reason of the fact that for a majority of people in the developed world it represents the place of most common encounter with words and music combined. It is also an area in which music is clearly understood to be subservient to language and it therefore provides a starting point for a journey from one condition of relative value to another. The next area for examination is that of song; first the popular song (and in particular “Les feuilles mortes” by Kosma and Prévert) along with some discussion of translation and appropriation, and then the art song, through a brief account of Schubert’s Der Erlkönig. There is then a consideration of opera itself and an attempt to draw some conclusions, based on the previous discussions, concerning the extent to which libretto and music can be truly and beneficially alloyed in a dramatic work. The decline and final disappearance of spoken dialogue is cited as evidence of the progressive musical domination of the genre. But, in turn, questions arise as to the viability of the sung dramatic discourse. Matters of mutual responsibility between collaborators are also discussed. Finally, there is a brief account of how these contemplations informed the composition of The Hoop of the World, along with a few of the measures that were adopted in response to certain perceived difficulties inherent in the operatic form. The composer is not yet clear as to whether or not a true personal reconciliation with the genre as a whole has been achieved but there is a deeper sense of engagement with the proposition that may well lead to further creative exploits. The folio of works includes two instrumental works, Marteaux suspendus, for solo piano, and “x,y” for percussion ensemble. There is no mention of these works in the critical commentary, as such relationships as they bear to the operatic work are of a purely technical nature and of no relevance to the principal chosen topic of discussion...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} two studies of music {{listening}} to regulate emotional states in young people. Study 1 examined the <b>utility</b> of self-selected <b>music</b> listening to regulate anxiety related to assignment writing. Sixty university students (Mage = 18. 61 years) in the non-clinical range on mood symptoms {{were randomly assigned}} to one of three experimental conditions: music before, music during, or no music. Participants in the music conditions listened to self-selected music either before or while writing an assignment plan, while the no music condition completed the task in silence. Using physiological (i. e., skin conductance) and self-report measures, the specific aim of this study was to examine the effect of self-selected music listening on university students’ arousal, valence, and urge to procrastinate. Despite a discrepancy between subjective and physiological arousal levels in response to music listening, results of mixed analyses of variance showed that participants’ arousal ratings started decreasing when they listened to music (in comparison with the no music condition). Additionally, there was a trend in the data which suggested that participants’ valence ratings started improving when they listened to music, however, this between conditions effect failed to reach significance. Music listening was found to have no effect on participants’ urge to procrastinate. Finally, there was a significant interaction between condition and time such that participants in the music before condition reported significantly reduced arousal in the anticipatory phase of the assignment task (i. e., when they listened to their self-selected music), whereas participants in the music during and no music conditions continued to report elevated arousal at this time. This supports the conceptualization of assignment anxiety as an anticipatory phenomenon. Study 2 was intended to further examine the link between music listening and emotion regulation in a homework emotion regulation task. This study adopted a randomized between-group comparison where one group used music listening and the other group used thought challenging to regulate emotional states. Fifty-nine university students (Mage = 18. 91 years) in the non-clinical range on mood symptoms {{were randomly assigned to}} complete weekly self-monitoring in the form of either a music diary or thought record for a one-month period. Participants were assessed at pre- and post-treatment on the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS- 21) and Music Affective Response Scale (MARS), as well as weekly ratings on five key emotion variables (e. g., ability to name emotional states; confidence in managing strong emotions). Further, the effectiveness of the music diary and thought record in regulating the emotional states of participants was assessed via self-reported ratings of valence and arousal. Results showed that despite a lack of change in mood symptoms and emotional sensitivity to music over the four weeks, the music diary and thought record produced comparable improvements in the emotion regulation skills of participants and were equally effective in regulating emotional states. Repeated measures analyses showed that both groups significantly improved on all five weekly ratings of emotion, with no differences observed between the two groups. Furthermore, participants rated the music diary as a more effective and engaging emotion regulation strategy than the thought record. In conclusion, this research shows that strategic music listening can be used to regulate emotional states in young people not only in a laboratory but in everyday life...|$|R
