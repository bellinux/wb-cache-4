25|$|In recent 3GPP and WiMAX standards, MU-MIMO {{is being}} treated {{as one of the}} {{candidate}} technologies adoptable in the specification by a number of companies, including Samsung, Intel, Qualcomm, Ericsson, TI, Huawei, Philips, Nokia, and Freescale. For these and other firms active in the mobile hardware market, MU-MIMO is more feasible for low-complexity cell phones with a small number of reception antennas, whereas single-user SU-MIMO's higher per-user throughput is better suited to more complex <b>user</b> <b>devices</b> with more antennas.|$|E

30|$|After {{finding the}} best {{neighboring}} transmitter, the <b>user</b> <b>device</b> needs to disconnect {{from its current}} serving transmitter (steps 5 to 7). To disconnect the <b>user</b> <b>device</b> from its serving transmitter, the coordinator releases the resources of Transmitter # 1 that are used for the <b>user</b> <b>device.</b> The <b>user</b> <b>device</b> starts connecting to the selected neighboring transmitter by sending a link switching request (step 8). The coordinator performs call admission control and radio resource control to check if the call is accepted or not (step 9). After that, the coordinator responses to the link switching request of the <b>user</b> <b>device</b> (step 10). Then, the <b>user</b> <b>device</b> starts, one by one, the association process and synchronization process with the selected neighboring transmitter, i.e., Transmitter # 2 (steps 11 to 14). The <b>user</b> <b>device</b> and the selected neighboring transmitter exchange information such as the network ID, beacon interval, the addresses of the devices, and the channel identification. Finally, the data are sent to the <b>user</b> <b>device</b> through Transmitter # 2.|$|R

At this time, first, the <b>user</b> <b>device</b> disassociates with its current serving {{transmitter}} and deletes all the information related to it. Because the <b>user</b> <b>device</b> has already used the resources of this transmitter, it cannot disassociate itself as we explained above. In this case, the <b>user</b> <b>device</b> needs to send a disassociation message to its current serving transmitter so that this transmitter can release resources allocated for the <b>user</b> <b>device</b> to avoid the waste of resources.|$|R
