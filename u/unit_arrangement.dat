50|$|The two {{extended}} {{ships were}} intended to bury all criticisms of the design once and for all. The hull dimensions were increased. adding 10 ft in length and 2.5 ft to the beam.

5000|$|A {{criticism}} of the older designs {{was the use of}} adjacent boiler rooms. This had been adopted to allow for a single funnel, to lower the silhouette and increase the deck space of the relatively small hull. However, this made the ship vulnerable to being disabled by a single hit amidships. To remedy this, the Weapon class adopted the [...] "unit" [...] system, of side-by-side boiler and engine rooms with alternate port/starboard arrangement. This was standard practice in United States Navy ships, but these were generally far larger than their Royal Navy counterparts. The <b>unit</b> <b>arrangement</b> meant that 2 funnels were needed. The forward funnel was trunked up through the foremast and there was a small stump funnel between the torpedo tubes. This led to an unusual and rather unbalanced appearance, {{similar to that of the}} , and the Weapons were not the most attractive of ships.|$|E

40|$|LectureLecture 5 : Epicyclic gear {{technology}} is a key factor to support thcompression growth strategy in electrified applications, due to the ever increasing transmission ratio required to meet the high compressor speeds. The paper collects {{the experience of the}} authors in developing a unique product through its conceptual design, as well as its mechanical and rotordynamic assessment, up to its complete validation with a full speed full load test in a complete <b>unit</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The main target of high pressure ratio compressors is to fulfil the required compression service with one casing less than traditional technology. The new compressor technology results in machines which run much higher in speed. To achieve a compressor ratio of ~ 30 in a single casing, the rotational speed is increase by roughly 40 % respect to a traditional compression train, and therefore it becomes the most critical parameter. The specific requirements of higher speeds at high powers dictate the need for the very high speed ratio gearing, which was {{critical to the success of}} the new compressor technology. The power transmission was jointly developed by the gear and compressor manufacturers. The methods used to evaluate the gearbox configuration options are detailed in this paper, along with the gearbox specific technology design challenges faced.

40|$|AbstractHow {{to prevent}} the hot air {{entering}} the outdoor unit is thus critical for Split-typeÂ airÂ conditioner (AC) operation temperature control. This investigation studied the influence of louver installation (angle and spacing) and outdoor AC <b>unit</b> <b>arrangement</b> (style and location) on the system ventilation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. With the louver spacing increasing and the distance between neighbouring outdoor AC units decreasing, the working temperature increases. Considering heatÂ dissipation and protecting machines from rainwater, the optimum louver angle is 100 degrees. The vertical arrangement for outdoor units is more beneficial to exhaust hot air than the horizontal arrangement. In conclusion, {{in order to reduce}} operation temperature while saving energy, the following design points are recommended:a. Vertical arrangement for outdoor units;b. Larger distance between neighbouring outdoor units;c. Smaller louver spacing;d. 100 degrees for the louver angle...|$|E

40|$|This present {{research}} {{is motivated by}} observing the diversity of views held in understanding the portrayal of Solomon in 1 Kgs 1 - 11, its importance in resolving {{the problem of the}} composition of DtrH, and especially by a certain doubt about the pervasive Josianic understandings of Solomon. The main concern of the present study is to establish a sound understanding of Solomon as portrayed in I Kgs 1 - 11 in relation to the theories of the composition of Kings, especially the Josianic redaction theory. This study seeks to understand Solomon in 1 Kgs 1 - 11 {{from the perspective of the}} text's persuasive function in relation to the reader. Chapter one surveys modem researches on Kings in general and the Solomon narrative (1 Kgs 1 - 11) in particular. It shows that the essential question in studies of Kings and the Solomon account is the understanding of the thematic tensions in relation to their composition. This chapter also argues that a rhetorical approach is methodologically relevant in solving the question. Chapter two defines what rhetorical criticism is, and in relation to the definition, shows how a rhetorical approach will be applied to our study of 1 Kgs 1 - 11. Rhetorical criticism is a methodology concerned with determining the means of persuasion employed in the communication, through an analysis of the text in its final form. This chapter also establishes four practical steps for discovering the argumentative or persuasive function of the Solomon text: the rhetorical <b>unit,</b> <b>arrangement</b> (dispositio) and style (elocutio), argumentation (inventio), and finally the rhetorical situation and the original reader. Following these steps, chapter three identifies 1 Kgs 1 - 11 as a rhetorical unit by showing 1 Kgs 1 - 2 as the true beginning of the narrative through the structural and rhetorical connections between 1 Kgs 1 - 2 and 3 - 11. Chapter four examines how 1 Kgs 1 - 11 as a persuasive narration has been arranged in order to have an impact on the reader's apprehension of the Solomon narrative. It shows the concentric structure of 1 Kgs 1 - 11 based on the function of repetition, which guides the reader to the picture of Solomon's incapacity in his `covenant relationship' with Yahweh. Chapter five examines I Kgs 1 - 11 from the point of view of argumentation or invention, and deals with the understanding or evaluation of the issue in I Kgs 1 - 11. The narrator in 1 Kgs 1 - 11 shows the reader Solomon's failure in the relationship with Yahweh based on his ethical and rational, and emotional, appeal. Chapter six defines the rhetorical situation which causes the existence of 1 Kgs 1 - 11. It shows that Kings would be a fitting response to the rhetorical situation of the Jewish exilic community in Babylon. The community may have held very different views about their past, their identity, or the continuity of the covenant relationship with Yahweh in the exilic or post-exilic period. Our conclusion in this study of 1 Kgs 1 - 11 is that the subtle portrayal of Solomon in 1 Kgs 1 - 11 does not display a Josianic standpoint, but an exilic view, persuading the Babylonian exiles to recover their covenant relationship with Yahweh or to find a new understanding of this through the portrayal of Solomon in the light of his inevitable failure in relationship with Yahweh...|$|E

40|$|The landscapes {{currently}} {{studied in}} ecology are either âdiscontinuous â (category-based or patchbased), {{as in the}} case of mosaics of agricultural units, or of more âcontinuous â type (raster lattices), as used for representing elevation or other ecological gradients. The main landscape models either involve explicit processes or are neutral, recreating spatial patterns in the absence of studied processes (using statistical rules). This article presents neutral models suitable for the creation and handling of patchy landscapes. These models (Patchy Landscape Neutral Models) adapt the Gibbs process already used successfully in forestry and biology to describe the local interactions between landscape units. These interactions can be either ecological, if justified for example by natural mechanisms of dispersal (plant species dynamics) or crop successions in anthropized landscapes, or statistical (geometrical). We define a global &quot;cost function &quot; representative of the landscape to be simulated by summing the &quot;pair function &quot; that expresses the interactions between units for the whole landscape.
