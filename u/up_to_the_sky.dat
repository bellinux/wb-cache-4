25|$|The orca, wolf, raven, spider, whale, were revered animals. Also {{folklore}} (e.g. tale) examples demonstrate this. For example, {{a spider}} saves {{the life of}} a girl. The motif of spider as a benevolent personage, saving people from peril with its cobweb, lifting them <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> in danger, is present also in many tales of Sireniki Eskimos (as mentioned, their exact classification inside Eskimo peoples is not settled yet).|$|E

25|$|In chapter five Cuthbert, {{while still}} a youth tending to sheep in Lauderdale, has {{a vision of}} a bishop being borne to heaven; {{subsequently}} it is discovered that Aidan, bishop of Lindisfarne, had died on the same hour as Cuthbert's vision. Far to the south, a young Cuthbert is travelling during the winter and crosses the river Wear at Chester-le-Street, taking shelter in one of the empty summer dwellings; suffering from lack of food, his horse pulls down warm bread and meat from the roof of the dwelling (chapter six). Book i ends with the anonymous author making mention of several other miracles of Cuthbert's youth without going into detail: how God provided food for him in camp with his army against an enemy, how he saw the soul of a reeve taken <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> his defeat of some demons, and his cure of the insane (chapter seven).|$|E

500|$|Henry was bankrupted by his {{military}} expenditure and general extravagance. The pope offered Henry's brother Richard the Kingdom of Sicily, {{but the military}} cost of displacing the incumbent Emperor Frederick was prohibitive. Matthew Paris wrote that Richard stated: [...] "You might as well say, 'I make you a present of the moon—step <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and take it down'." [...] Instead, Henry purchased the kingdom for his son Edmund, which angered many powerful barons. The barons led by Henry's brother-in-law Simon de Montfort forced him {{to agree to the}} Provisions of Oxford, under which his debts were paid in exchange for substantial reforms. In France, with the Treaty of Paris, Henry formally surrendered the territory of his Angevin ancestors to Louis IX of France, receiving in return the title duke of Aquitaine and the territory of Gascony as a vassal of the French king.|$|E

Minaj is shown fading into clouds, before she raps her first verse wearing a black flowing dress and a crown of thorns. Minaj has various wardrobe changes in the video. Minaj is then seen dressed as a queen, over a balcony with a spiral chandelier behind her. Various clips of nature are shown such as waves, birds, and grass. Minaj is then seen singing the chorus in a blonde wig, in a vast space, {{with a lot of}} fog. Minaj raps her second verse sitting on a throne donning a black wig similar to the on she wore in her previous music video for [...] "I Am Your Leader". After scenes of nature and of Minaj, the video transforms into color.

2500|$|The {{blue-footed booby}} is monogamous, {{although}} {{it has the potential}} to be bigamous. It is an opportunistic breeder, with the breeding cycle occurring every 8 to 9 months. The courtship of the blue-footed booby consists of the male flaunting his blue feet and dancing to impress the female. The male begins by showing his feet, strutting in front of the female. Then, he presents nest materials and finishes the mating ritual with a final display of his feet. The dance also includes [...] "sky-pointing", which involves the male pointing his head and bill <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> while keeping the wings and tail raised.|$|E

2500|$|The contests, too, were an illusion.

Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at Útgarða-Loki but he is gone and so is his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.|$|E
2500|$|As soon as our line, set on its jolting way, emerged, I {{felt that}} two men close by had been hit, two shadows {{fell to the}} ground and rolled under our feet, one with a high-pitched scream and the other in silence like an ox. Another {{disappeared}} with a movement like a madman, {{as if he had been}} carried away. Instinctively, we closed ranks and pushed each other forward, always forward, and the wound in our midst closed itself. The warrant officer stopped and raised his sword, dropped it, fell to his knees, his kneeling body falling backwards in jerks, his helmet fell on his heels and he remained there, his head uncovered, looking <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> The line has promptly split to avoid breaking this immobility. [...] But we couldn't see the lieutenant any more. No more superiors, then... A moment's hesitation held back the human wave which had reached the beginning of the plateau. The hoarse sound of air passing through our lungs could be heard over the stamping of feet. [...] Forward! cried a soldier.

2500|$|One night, Ibrahim {{went up to}} the mountain, {{leaned against}} a rock, and looked <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> He saw a shining star and said to himself, [...] "Could this be my Lord?" [...] But when it set he said: [...] "I don't like those that set." [...] The star had {{disappeared}} so it could not be God. God is always present. Then he saw the moon rising in splendor and said, [...] "Could this be my Lord?" [...] but the moon also set. At daybreak, he saw the sun rising and said, [...] "Could this be my Lord? This is the biggest and brightest!" [...] But when the sun also set he said, [...] "O my people! I am free from all that you join as partners with Allah! I have turned my face towards Allah who created the heavens and the earth and never shall I associate partners with Allah. Our Lord is the creator of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He has the power to make the stars rise and set." [...] After this declaration, Ibrahim then heard Allah calling him, [...] "O Ibrahim!" [...] Ibrahim trembled and said, [...] "Here I am O my Lord!" [...] Allah replied, [...] "Submit to Me! Be a Muslim!" [...] Ibrahim fell to the ground, crying. He said: [...] "I submit to the Lord of the universe!" [...] Ibrahim kept prostrating himself until nightfall. He then got up and went back to his home, in peace and full of conviction that Allah has guided him to the truth.|$|E

2500|$|The {{match at}} WrestleMania {{was part of}} a storyline in which Guerrero turned on Mysterio and beat him up after abandoning him during a match against MNM for the Tag Team Championship. Then after a no {{disqualification}} match against Chavo, Eddie came out and slammed Mysterio on the steel steps, displaying Eddie's increasing frustration with being unable to defeat Mysterio. Guerrero and Mysterio continued to feud, with Guerrero threatening to reveal a secret he and Mysterio shared involving Mysterio's real life son Dominick, unless Mysterio deferred to Guerrero's authority. Guerrero later revealed that, in the storyline, he was Dominick's biological father. The storyline went that Guerrero knew Mysterio was having trouble starting his own family, so Guerrero left Dominick as a baby with Mysterio and his wife Angie to raise. In subsequent weeks, Guerrero threatened to take custody of Dominick, drawing up custody papers and having his lawyer present them to Mysterio. At SummerSlam, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a ladder match for the custody of Dominick. Their feud ended when Guerrero gained a victory over Mysterio in a steel cage match. On November 13, 2005, Eddie Guerrero was found dead in his hotel room in Minneapolis, Minnesota. That same day at a WWE [...] "Super Show" [...] where SmackDown! and Raw were both taped, Mysterio gave an emotional speech about Guerrero, and in a show of respect removed his mask (though he put his head down, so no one could see his face). Mysterio went on to defeat Shawn Michaels in an interpromotional match later that night. After the match, Michaels and Mysterio hugged in the ring and Mysterio pointed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> crying, in memory of Guerrero.|$|E
2500|$|Ahern {{has said}} that he lives by the Ten Commandments, the Beatitudes and his own conscience, and hopes to get to heaven when he dies. Speaking to Gay Byrne in RTÉ's The Meaning of Life series, Mr Ahern {{described}} himself as a regular Mass-goer, but said he had not been to Confession for 40 years. In a lengthy interview, Mr Ahern revealed that he and the former DUP leader Dr Ian Paisley bonded over their shared faith when they had their first formal meeting together. The meeting took place in January 2004 at the Irish Embassy in London. He recalled how Dr Paisley began a prayer in the Irish Embassy and he joined in with him. He said the prayer was [...] "like our Confiteor" [...] and officials had wondered why they had spent so much time alone. The pair started discussing their values and the rules by which they lived. His government came under severe criticism for the deal they made with the religious orders, capping their contribution to the redress board at €128 million while taxpayers will have to pay out €1 billion. As a Catholic, he wanted the church to [...] "do well", but it could not retreat behind canon law, he said. [...] "There was one time when the church tried to put up the defence of canon law and my colleagues just looked <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and thought they were joking. Unfortunately, they weren’t joking, they made bad decisions." [...] Mr Ahern said he was convinced that life [...] "did not end at the graveyard" [...] and he often prayed to dead relatives for guidance. He used Mass as an opportunity to pray for people in trouble and stayed off alcohol in November and at Lent. He rationalised inexplicable events, such as the death of a young person, by stating that God cannot influence [...] "every single thing". He said he received a [...] "fair amount of hate mail" [...] about [...] "living in sin", but it upset other people more than it did him and he admitted that he had not lived up to his parents’ [...] "stereotype" [...] of married life.|$|E
