5|$|The {{region was}} known for its wine. Since the 15th century the local {{inhabitants}} practiced viticulture and the wine producers formed St. Paul Vintners' Guild in 1447, the oldest such guild in the German-speaking world. Terraced vineyards extended <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the Krems River until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation. The Loiben plain supported both viticulture and agriculture. As the terrain became steeper, the vines grew in terraces built from the dark Urgestein, primordial rock. From Dürenstein to Krems the river makes its wide curve; {{the mountains and the}} steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line-of-sight between the two towns.|$|E

25|$|Most Cucuteni-Trypillia pottery was hand coiled {{from local}} clay. Long coils of clay {{were placed in}} circles to form first the base and then {{the walls of the}} vessel. Once the desired shape and height of the {{finished}} product was built <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> would then be smoothed to create a seamless surface. This technique was the earliest form of pottery shaping and the most common in the Neolithic; however, {{there is some evidence that}} they also used a primitive type of slow-turning potter's wheel, an innovation that did not become common in Europe until the Iron Age.|$|E

25|$|In prehistoric times, great {{amounts of}} {{sediment}} {{collected on the}} floor of Lake Amora. The sediment was heavier than the salt deposits and squeezed the salt deposits upwards into what are now the Lisan Peninsula and Mount Sodom (on the southwest side of the lake). Geologists explain the effect in terms of a bucket of mud into which a large flat stone is placed, forcing the mud to creep <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the bucket. When the floor of the Dead Sea dropped further due to tectonic forces, the salt mounts of Lisan and Mount Sodom stayed in place as high cliffs (see salt dome).|$|E
25|$|Southampton's {{third round}} draw saw the club host Championship side Sheffield Wednesday on 25 September. After {{half an hour}} of {{pressure}} from both sides, Jay Rodriguez scored his first goal for the Saints with a shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area to put the hosts ahead. Following a number of additional chances for Southampton to go two <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> went into half time at 1–0. Despite a number of clear cut chances in the second half, it took until the 78th minute for Rodriguez to double Southampton's lead when he converted a penalty following a foul on winger Steve De Ridder. Wednesday increased the pressure in the final part of the match, but were unable to reverse Southampton's win.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other action puzzle games such as Tetris or Puzzle League {{where the}} player {{directly}} manipulates the game pieces, either as they fall or via a cursor, the player directly controls the character Toad, who moves around inside {{the playing field}} atop the fallen objects. Toad can pick up individual objects or lift entire stacks and place them elsewhere in the playing field, but is unable to manipulate objects he cannot immediately reach. However, Toad can perform a variety of additional tricks, such as kicking objects across the play field and scurrying <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of stacks to retrieve specific objects. If the player cannot clear the playing field of its objects quickly enough, the play field will eventually fill to the brim and trap Toad, resulting in a Game Over.|$|E

500|$|In {{areas where}} it is hilly or mountainous near the coastline, thermally-forced sea breezes {{combined}} with wind circulations <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the mountains can encourage the production of chemicals {{which can lead to}} the development of smog.

500|$|General Gates, {{who oversaw}} the {{northern}} defenses, was aware that Mount Defiance threatened the fort. [...] John Trumbull had pointed this out as early as 1776, when a shot fired from the fort was able to reach Defiance's summit, and several officers inspecting the hill noted that there were approaches to its summit where gun carriages could be pulled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> [...] As the garrison {{was too small to}} properly defend all the existing works in area, Mount Defiance was left undefended. [...] Anthony Wayne left Ticonderoga in April 1777 to join Washington's army; he reported to Washington that [...] "all was well", and that the fort [...] "can never be carried, without much loss of blood".|$|E
500|$|At 1 {{o'clock on}} Saturday 14 April, the steamers began leaving Circular Quay, {{conveying}} 8,000 {{of an estimated}} 10,000-strong crowd to Middle Harbour – a large crowd considering the alternative attractions that day of Sydney Royal Easter Show (known then simply as [...] "the Exhibition") and horse racing. The remainder were reported to be walking from St Leonards, with a [...] being collected along the way. Spectators clambered <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the bay for vantage points, while hundreds more stayed on board steamboats, yachts and in row boats below. The rope was strung across the entrance to Willoughby Bay, from Folly Point {{to the head of}} the bay, a reported length of , [...] above the waters below. The distance meant that two ropes were required, spliced together in the centre, to reach the other side, with 16 stays fixed to the shore and into the harbour to steady the structure.|$|E

500|$|Helvella queletii has {{a roughly}} similar form and appearance, but the ribbing in that species {{does not extend}} up the margin as does H.acetabulum. H.griseoalba has ribs that extend halfway <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the fruit body, but {{the color of the}} cup is pale to dark gray rather than cream. The fruit bodies also {{resemble}} those of H.costifera, but the latter species is distinguished [...] by its grayish to grayish-brown hymenium; like H.acetabulum, it has ribs that extend to most of the outside of the fruit body. There are sometimes intermediate forms between the two species, making them difficult to distinguish. H.robusta is also similar to H.acetabulum, but has a lighter-colored hymenium, a robust stem, and the margin of the fruit body is often bent over the stem at maturity. In contrast, H.acetabulum never has the edge of the fruit body bent over the stem, and the stem is [...] "indistinct or prominent, but never robust".|$|E
500|$|A {{standard}} gauge railway tunnel, codenamed Ida, {{was to be}} built on a curving path that would connect it with both the east- and west-bound main line railway, allowing trains to run straight through the complex without needing to reverse or be turned around. This would serve as the main unloading station, where missiles and supplies would be offloaded onto trolleys that would transport them into the connecting galleries Mathilde and Hugo. Hugo connected in turn with Sophie, a dead-end railway tunnel branching from the main line into Ida. Each of the main tunnels {{had a number of}} unnamed side tunnels of the same dimensions as the main tunnels and up to [...] long. The central feature of the complex was a huge octagonal rocket-preparation chamber directly under the dome. It was never completed but would have been [...] in diameter and up to [...] high.

5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting of air <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> {{of a mountain}} or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on <b>the</b> descending, leeward <b>side.</b> <b>The</b> resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|R

The buffers are mostly closed-canpoy floodplain forests, with mowed lawns making up the remainder. In recent years colonies of Japanese knotweed, an invasive species, have been observed along the banks and in buffer areas. They are considered detrimental to the stream's health since they do not provide shade, are less effective at controlling erosion and, since they grow in thick clusters, impede access to the stream.|$|E
