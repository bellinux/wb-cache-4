50|$|The Ardea {{had a deep}} sided, {{hexagonal}} cross-section fuselage, entirely plywood skinned. Its pilot sat in a small, deep cockpit, {{head against}} {{the front of the}} pedestal and partly protected from the airstream by the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>panels,</b> which both lifted off for entry. There was a conventional single skid undercarriage under the forward fuselage aft to the wing trailing edge, with a small tailskid. The fuselage tapered gently to the tail, where a large, roughly elliptical balanced rudder, mounted on a much smaller fin, extended down to the keel. The Ardea's balanced elevators together formed a slender ellipse in plan, though with a cut-out for rudder movement.|$|E
50|$|The Airone {{had a deep}} sided, {{hexagonal}} cross-section fuselage, entirely plywood skinned. Its pilot sat in a small, deep cockpit, {{head against}} {{the front of the}} pedestal and partly protected from the airstream by the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>panels,</b> which both lifted off for entry. There was a conventional single skid undercarriage under the forward fuselage aft to the wing trailing edge, with a small tailskid. The fuselage tapered gently to the tail, where the horizontal surfaces, braced and straight edged but with elliptical tips were mounted on top of a short fin. The elevators used a thick aerofoil for efficiency and had a cut-out for the balanced rudder. This was large, extending down to the keel with straight edges and rounded corners.|$|E

40|$|Fiber metal {{laminates}} (FML) are composites laminated by fiber {{reinforced plastics}} (FRP) and aluminum alloy. GLARE, {{one of the}} FML laminated by Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastics and aluminum alloy, {{has been applied to}} an <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>panel</b> in an Airbus A 380. The precise stress distribution of the out of plane components has not been discussed around the contact hole boundary, though several papers applied the three dimensional (3 D) finite element method (FEM) to GLARE for delamination failure analysis. This paper applies 3 D-FEM to a GLARE pin joint and obtains the characteristic stresses near the contact region. Effects of material properties and plasticity on the distribution and magnitude of stresses are discussed together with previous results of Carbon FML obtained by the present authors. It was found that within the practical range of material properties and loading stroke, their effects on the stress distribution are small and that the magnitude depends on them. A model that relates the out of plane normal stress Ïƒ ZZ with the longitudinal stiffness of FRP is presented, which explains well the several numerical results...|$|R

The first two A400M Atlas were delivered to the Turkish Air Force in 2014. All A400M Atlas deliveries to the Turkish Air Force {{are scheduled to be}} completed by 2018. Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) produces several components of the A400M Atlas, including the middle-front fuselage, emergency exit doors, rear <b>fuselage</b> <b>upper</b> <b>panels,</b> rear upper escape doors, ailerons and spoilers; which are sent to the Airbus Military factory in Spain for assembly.|$|R
40|$|In {{aircraft}} assembly, {{frames are}} usually {{used as the}} skeleton shape benchmarks of a <b>fuselage</b> <b>panel</b> to locate other parts accurately, thereby coordinating the relative position relationships between each part. In order to guarantee the assembly quality, a methodology for analyzing the effect of positioning errors of frames on <b>fuselage</b> <b>panel</b> assembly deformation is proposed. A finite element model of the <b>fuselage</b> <b>panel</b> is established first and then a mathematical model for representing the assembly deformation is derived. To contain more assembly deformation information, the optimal measurement point placement method is adopted to extract a set of finite element nodes as the measurement point locations from a large candidate set. Meanwhile, the mathematical relationship between the position errors of measurement points and the positioning errors of frames is also determined, which is then combined with the Monte Carlo simulation and the grey relational analysis to quantitatively analyze the impacts of the positioning error(s) generated by single or multiple frames on <b>fuselage</b> <b>panel</b> assembly deformation...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{residual}} strength pressure tests and nonlinear analyses of stringer- and frame-stiffened aluminum <b>fuselage</b> <b>panels</b> with longitudinal cracks are presented. Two types of damage are considered: a longitudinal crack located midway between stringers, and a longitudinal crack {{adjacent to a}} stringer and along a row of fasteners in a lap joint that has multiple-site damage (MSD). In both cases, the longitudinal crack is centered on a severed frame. The panels are subjected to internal pressure plus axial tension loads. The axial tension loads are equivalent to a bulkhead pressure load. Nonlinear elastic-plastic residual strength analyses of the <b>fuselage</b> <b>panels</b> are conducted using a finite element program and the crack-tip-opening-angle (CTOA) fracture criterion. Predicted crack growth and residual strength results from nonlinear analyses of the stiffened <b>fuselage</b> <b>panels</b> are compared with experimental measurements and observations.

50|$|Conversion of K2, K3 and K4 tankers {{took place}} at British Aerospace's Filton site. The K3s had a forward freight door, facilitating the {{insertion}} of five <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> tanks in the main fuselage; the K2s lacked forward freight doors, thus {{a section of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> was dismantled to insert the five upper tanks. In the K2 and K3 conversions, extensive floor reinforcement was installed to support the additional weight imposed by the five fuel tanks.|$|R

50|$|An {{electronic}} reconnaissance {{variant of}} the C-130B was designated C-130B-II. A total of 13 aircraft were converted. The C-130B-II was distinguished by its false external wing fuel tanks, which were disguised signals intelligence (SIGINT) receiver antennas. These pods were slightly larger than the standard wing tanks found on other C-130Bs. Most aircraft featured a swept blade antenna on the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage,</b> as well as extra wire antennas between the vertical fin and <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> not found on other C-130s.
