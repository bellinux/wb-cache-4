5|$|King {{was born}} in Philadelphia in 1873. Early in his life, he worked in a linen trade. Although this was the family business, his father later allowed him to leave to enter the {{insurance}} industry. King was {{not a member of}} the aristocratic and wealthy families of Philadelphia that produced many of the era's top cricketers. King's obituary in Cricket Quarterly suggests that his career in insurance was set <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> by those families to allow him to continue playing the game. In 1913 (or 1911), King married Fannie Lockhart; the marriage lasted for fifty years. King's wife died in 1963, and he died in 1965 in his native Philadelphia two days before his 92nd birthday.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} season, Wales {{completed}} their first full Home Nations Championship; Gould played as the lone centre {{in all three}} games. It was a fairly successful Championship for the Welsh, with a draw, a win and a loss, leaving them second in the table. Of note during the series was Bob Gould's captaincy in the second match, against Scotland, and Gould's first ever international dropped goal – which gave Wales a win over Ireland and made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> missing a dropped goal by just a yard in their draw against England. Due to work commitments, Gould only played {{one of the two}} Wales games of the 1888 Home Nations Championship, in the country's first victory over Scotland, thanks to a single try from Thomas Pryce-Jenkins. In the second game, played away to Ireland, George Bowen was given the centre position in the last match Wales would play with a three threequarter system. Gould then missed the first Welsh international against an overseas touring side, when the New Zealand Natives were beaten at St. Helen's in Swansea, and was still absent two months later for the opening game of the 1889 Championship. Gould returned in time for the clash with Ireland where he was given the captaincy and played alongside Llanelli centre Tom Morgan. Gould lost his first match as captain, losing by two tries to nil at home – this was the first of 18 caps he earned leading his country.|$|E

25|$|New York Jets scout Terry Bradway was {{impressed}} by Revis' workout but was concerned by the level of competition Pittsburgh played, as Louisville's Mario Urrutia was the toughest receiver Revis faced during the season. Despite this concern, the organization was so impressed by his man and zone coverage techniques {{and his ability to}} play the run that they decided to trade <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in the draft. Originally, New York discussed trading draft selections with the Houston Texans who had the 10th overall pick however, when the deal fell through, they traded their first, second and fifth round picks to the Carolina Panthers, moving from 25th overall to 14th overall, to select Revis.|$|E
25|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that Aurelian probably {{joined the army}} in 235 AD at around age twenty. It is also generally assumed that, {{as a member of}} the lowest rank of society - albeit a citizen - he would have enlisted in the ranks of the legions. Idiosyncratically, Saunders suggests that his career is more easily understood if it is assumed that his family was of Roman settler origins with a tradition of military service and that he enlisted as an equestrian. This would have opened <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> the tres militia - the three steps of the equestrian military career - one of the routes to higher equestrian office in the Imperial Service. This could be a more expeditious route to senior military and procuratorial offices than that pursued by ex-rankers, although not necessarily less laborious. However, Saunders's conjecture as to Aurelian's early career is not supported by any evidence other than his nomen which could indicate Italian settler ancestry - although even this is contested - and his rise to the highest ranks which is more easily understood if he did not have to start from the bottom. His suggestion has not been taken up by other academic authorities.|$|E
25|$|For much of {{its history}} Fittipaldi Automotive was entirely {{focussed}} around Emerson Fittipaldi. Emerson was a double world champion renowned for a smooth and quick style {{when he joined the}} family team. Although his older brother drove in the team's first season, the suggestion that Emerson might drive for the team was always in the air and only a year later he cancelled contract discussions with his then team McLaren at a very late stage and signed with Fittipaldi. Although he remained capable of front-running performances, during his time with Fittipaldi Automotive he became an inconsistent performer. On several occasions team manager Jo Ramírez berated his driver after a sudden burst of speed indicated that he had not been driving to his full potential. By 1980 Fittipaldi's team mate Keke Rosberg thought him long past his best, and found him demotivated. Emerson retired {{at the end of that}} year after five full seasons with the family team. Like fellow world champion Jacques Villeneuve’s five-year stint with the BAR team set <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> with BAT money in 1998, the partnership ended the front running Formula One career of a young and highly competitive driver, although he would later build a very successful career in top level American single seater racing in the CART series.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{featured}} matches of Triplemanía XX saw three former tag teams, and current rivals, reunite and {{face each other}} in a Parejas Suicidas match. The first team is the former La Familia de Tijuana of Extreme Tiger and Halloween. Together, Tiger and Halloween held the AAA World Tag Team Championship from April to September 2008, after which the team disbanded, when Halloween left AAA to join Perros del Mal Producciones. Halloween returned to AAA on June 6, 2010, at Triplemanía XVIII as a member of Los Perros del Mal and has ever since remained {{on the opposite side of}} Extreme Tiger, who turned técnico during Halloween's time away from the promotion. The rivalry between Halloween and Tiger ignited in early 2012, when the two ended up on opposite sides during the rivalry between Tiger's tag team partner Jack Evans and Los Perros del Mals leader El Hijo del Perro Aguayo. The second team in the match is the former The Hart Foundation 2.0 of Jack Evans and Teddy Hart, who joined AAA together in early 2008 as representatives of the rudo stable La Legión Extranjera (Foreign Legion). In May 2009, the team disbanded with Evans turning técnico, after which the two started feuding over the AAA Cruiserweight Championship. The feud ended without a proper conclusion in early 2010, when AAA suspended Hart indefinitely. Hart finally returned to AAA on March 18, 2012, at Rey de Reyes, and was on April 1 revealed as the newest member of Los Perros del Mal, taking over El Hijo del Perro Aguayo's feud with Evans as Aguayo moved on to chasing the AAA Mega Championship. The final team in the match is the former La Hermandad 187 of Joe Líder and Psicosis. After winning the AAA World Tag Team Championship from La Familia de Tijuana in September 2008, Líder and Psicosis, then known as Nicho el Millonario, held the title for 18 months, becoming the longest reigning champions in AAA history. Even after losing the title, Líder and Nicho remained together as a técnico team, feuding with the La Sociedad stable. In June 2011, AAA, in storyline, suspended Nicho, after he interfered in a six-man tag team match at Triplemanía XIX, where Líder, Heavy Metal and Electroshock, replacing the previously injured Nicho, faced Chessman, Silver King and Último Gladiador. On July 16, Nicho turned on Líder, believing that Líder had not stood <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> as he was, in his mind, being wronged by AAA. With Nicho joining Los Perros del Mal, he and Líder have had a bloody rivalry ever since. On April 6, 2012, the rivalry took another twist, when Líder burned Nicho's face with a fireball. Following the burning, Nicho began once again wearing his old mask and working under the ring name Psicosis, with the storyline being that Líder's fireball had not only severely burned Nicho's face, but the incident had also driven him insane. On July 11, it was announced that the Parejas Suicidas match would be taking place inside a steel cage. At the following day's Triplemanía XX press conference, the team of Chessman and AAA Cruiserweight Champion Juventud Guerrera was added to the match. Unlike the other teams in the match, Chessman and Guerrera have no prolonged history with each other, though they are on opposite sides in the battle between La Sociedad and AAA. In the months before Triplemanía XX, Chessman had been feuding with Vampiro, while Guerrera was busy with his former protégé Daga, who had turned on him and joined Los Perros del Mal. The losing team in the match would then face {{each other in a}} Lucha de Apuestas. If La Familia de Tijuana lost, the match would be a Mask vs. Hair match, in other cases it would be a Hair vs. Hair match.|$|E
