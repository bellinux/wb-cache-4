5|$|A logical {{extension}} of the humanist sans-serif concept is the font superfamily: a serif font and a matching humanist sans-serif with similar letterforms.

5|$|A snow groomer is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to smooth and compact the snow, rather than removing it altogether. Early snow groomers {{were used by}} residents of rural areas to compress the snow close to their homes, and consisted of a heavy roller hauled by oxen which compacted the snow to make a smooth surface for sledging. With {{the invention of the}} motor car, snow groomers were replaced by snowplows and snow blowers on public thoroughfares, but remained in <b>use</b> <b>at</b> ski resorts, where they are used to maintain smooth, safe trails for various wintersports, including skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling.
