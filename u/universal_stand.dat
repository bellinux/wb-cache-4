30|$|The mass median {{particle}} size, d 50, {{was measured}} by sieving the sample and determining the particle diameter for which 50  % of the distribution is below that particle size. Similarly the d 10 and d 90 represent the particle diameter for which 10 and 90  % of the distribution have a particle diameter below this value. The moisture content of the product was calculated on a wet basis using the product mass before and after oven drying at 105  °C for 4  h. Single particle compressive crush strength tests were carried out on product granules using a bench-top scale Instron testing machine. The maximum force applied to break the particle was measured. A minimum of 10 particles from each condition were tested and the average and standard deviation of the crush strength were determined. The carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen content of the samples were determined by combustion using a PerkinElmer 2400 series II CHNS/O analyser, operated in CHN mode. Oxygen contents of the samples were determined by difference. Samples were analysed in triplicate and a sample mass of approximately 2  mg was used. The granule surface morphology and cross-sectional area morphology were examined by optical microscopy (Motic SMZ- 168 microscope with <b>universal</b> <b>stand).</b> Individual granules from both lab and pilot-scale trials were examined. The cross-sectional area of the granules was exposed by fracturing the granules with a scalpel.|$|E

40|$|The idea of Universal Grammar (UG) as the {{hypothetical}} linguistic structure {{shared by all}} human languages harkens {{back at least to}} the 13 th century. The best known modern elaborations of the idea are due to Chomsky. Following a devastating critique from theoretical, typological and field linguistics, these elaborations, the idea of UG itself and the more general idea of language <b>universals</b> <b>stand</b> untenable and are largely abandoned. The proposal tackles {{the hypothetical}} contents of UG using dependent and polymorphic type theory in a framework very different from the Chomskyan ones. We introduce a type logic for a precise, universal and parsimonious representation of natural language morphosyntax and compositional semantics. The logic handles grammatical ambiguity (with polymorphic types), selectional restrictions and diverse kinds of anaphora (with dependent types), and features a partly universal set of morphosyntactic types (by the Curry-Howard isomorphism) ...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{implementation}} of a highly efficient universal index of textual documents. <b>Universal</b> <b>stands</b> {{for an opportunity to}} configure structures of index records and methods of the index data processing (without recompiling an application). Furthermore, it means that the index library can be used even for other purposes, for example to implement a thesaurus, to represent bibliographic relationships or even for generic representation of a specific class of functions in other areas than documentographic systems. The index is implemented using the dynamic inverted file which can be efficiently updated without need of the data structure rebuilding. Specific issue is on-line index compression and failure recovery via the transactional log. It is shown that the amortized complexity of the data structure is linear. This fact is afterwards experimentally verified. Other experiments address the compression methods and the impact of the data structure parameters on its efficiency. The diploma thesis contains the implementation of the universal index in C/C++. It has been tested in the Linux and Windows XP environments...|$|R

40|$|A central goal of {{linguistics}} is {{to explain}} the constraints on linguistic diversity. The landscape of linguistic diversity is vast, its boundaries invisible from a distance and its details obscure from up close. So-called linguistic <b>universals</b> <b>stand</b> as beacons {{as we try to}} map this unruly geography. Word order universals ― as described by Greenberg and elaborated by Dryer ― are the paradigm case of a clear structual constraint on the variation of language. In some schools of linguistics the word order universals have been taken as direct evidence of innate parameters, abstract cognitive structures shaping the ontogenetic development and the evolution of language. In other schools of linguistics, the dependencies between aspects of word order are understood as statistical tendencies reflecting universal systems biases. In this paper I argue that the light cast by these beacons might be deceiving us, and report a reanalysis of well-studied word order universals using phylogenetic methods. These tools have been pioneered in biology and evolutionary anthropology to solve "Galton's problem", the statistical interdependence of observations coming from genealogically related taxa (be they cultures, languages, species). A statistical, model based approach to variation in word order types in four language families shows that functional dependencies between word order traits vary greatly by lineage. Instead of being tightly constrained by cognitive factors specific to language, the patterns in word order diversity are the product of cultural evolution constrained by {{the current state of the}} system, so that future states are canalized within attraction basins specific to the particular linguistic lineage...|$|R

5000|$|The {{relationships}} of feminist anthropology with other strands of academic feminism are uneasy. By concerning {{themselves with the}} {{different ways in which}} different cultures constitute gender, feminist anthropology can contend that the oppression of women is not universal. Henrietta Moore argued that the concept of [...] "woman" [...] is insufficiently <b>universal</b> to <b>stand</b> as an analytical category in anthropological enquiry: that the idea of 'woman' was specific to certain cultures, and not a human universal. For some feminists, anthropologist Michelle Rosaldo wrote, this argument contradicted a core principle of their understanding of relations between men and women. Contemporary feminist anthropologist Marilyn Strathern argues that anthropology, which must deal with difference rather than seeking to erase it, is not necessarily harmed by this disagreement, but notes nonetheless that feminist anthropology faces resistance.|$|R

40|$|The Two-Handed Tile Assembly Model (2 HAM) is a {{model of}} {{algorithmic}} self-assembly in which large structures, or assemblies of tiles, are grown by the binding of smaller assemblies. In order to bind, two assemblies must have matching glues that can simultaneously touch each other, and stick together with strength that is at least the temperature τ, where τ is some fixed positive integer. We ask whether the 2 HAM is intrinsically universal. In other words, we ask: is there a single 2 HAM tile set U which can be used to simulate any instance of the model? Our main result is a negative answer to this question. We show that for all τ′ < τ, each temperature-τ′ 2 HAM tile system does not simulate at least one temperature-τ 2 HAM tile system. This impossibility result proves that the 2 HAM is not intrinsically <b>universal</b> and <b>stands</b> in contrast {{to the fact that the}} (single-tile addition) abstract Tile Assembly Model is intrinsically universal.
