All of the basalts show higher Sr isotopic compositions {{than those of the}} mantle array, which is attributed to seawater alteration. The basalts with lower Nd isotopic values ranging in age from 20. 6 to 17. 3 Ma have tapped an enriched subcontinental upper mantle (SCUM) with the minor involvement of a depleted asthenospheric mantle (AM). Subsequent change in composition through the physical replacement of SCUM by AM yielded the basalts of the <b>upper</b> <b>sills</b> of higher Nd isotopic compositions.

50|$|Rivers whose {{discharge}} {{is liable}} to become quite small at their low stage, or which have a somewhat large fall, as is usual in {{the upper part of}} rivers, cannot be given an adequate depth for navigation purely by works which regulate the flow; their ordinary summer level has to be raised by impounding the flow with weirs at intervals across the channel, while a lock has to be provided alongside the weir, or in a side channel, to provide for the passage of vessels. A river is thereby converted into a succession of fairly level reaches rising in steps up-stream, providing still-water navigation comparable to a canal; but it differs from a canal in the introduction of weirs for keeping up the water-level, in the provision for the regular discharge of the river at the weirs, and in the two sills of the locks being laid at the same level instead of the <b>upper</b> <b>sill</b> being raised above the lower one to the extent of the rise at the lock, as usual on canals.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDebris {{avalanches}} {{derived from}} the flanks of volcanic islands are among the largest on Earth. Debris avalanches are rare, catastrophic destabilizations that still keep geologists debating about the mechanisms that initiate them and make them travel huge runout distances. To {{shed light on the}} trigger of such destabilizations, we studied the inland scar of a debris avalanche deposit cropping out at Piton des Neiges, a dormant and eroded basaltic volcano of La Réunion Island. The avalanche deposit rests on a pile of 50 - 70 sill intrusions with a shallow northward dip, i. e. toward the sea. We measured the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in a transect across the uppermost sill of the pile in contact with the avalanche deposit. This transect reveals a strongly asymmetric magnetic fabric, consistent with a north-directed shear movement of the upper intrusion wall. This suggests that the <b>upper</b> <b>sill</b> induced a co-intrusive shear displacement of the volcano flank toward the sea. The <b>upper</b> <b>sill</b> margin in contact with the avalanche is striated, showing that this intrusion is older than the avalanche. Striae indicate a northward direction of avalanche runout. The <b>upper</b> <b>sill</b> margin also displays a magmatic lineation consistent with a magma flow in the intrusion toward the north. There is thus a striking kinematic consistency between the directions of intrusion propagation and avalanche runout, both oriented toward the sea. From the above results, we propose that repeated sill intrusions, such as observed on Piton des Neiges, increase the instability of a volcanic edifice. Each injection induces an incremental slip of the overlying rock mass, which may eventually end up into a landslide. Sill intrusions associated with seaward displacements of volcano flank, such as inferred for the April 2007 eruption of Piton de la Fournaise (also in La Réunion), should therefore be considered as a potential trigger of debris avalanches...|$|E

We used petrologic {{observations}} and geochemical analyses to study how the sill interacted with the sedimentary rocks. Field relationships show that an <b>Upper</b> <b>Sill</b> and numerous associated Minor Intrusions were emplaced in the sedimentary host rocks before intrusion of the Main Sill, some 10 m above its upper contact. Geochemical analyses reveal two magma contamination processes: Nb and Ta anomalies, coupled with incompatible element enrichment, record contamination by deep crustal rocks, whereas Li, Pb and Ba anomalies reveal a superficial contamination through fluid circulation at the contact between magmatic and sedimentary rocks. Analysis of mineral assemblages and geochemical data from the contact aureole demonstrate uniform metamorphic conditions between the two main intrusions and an absence of a thermal gradient. The identification of pyrrhotite by magnetization analyses and of orthopyroxene by microprobe analyses indicates very high temperatures, up to 660 °C. Thermal modelling explains these temperatures as the coupled effects of the Main Sill and the earlier intruded <b>Upper</b> <b>Sill</b> and Minor Intrusions.

40|$|Leg 58 {{successfully}} recovered basalt at Sites 442, 443, and 444, in the Shikoku Basin, and at Site 446 in the Daito Basin. Only at Site 442 did penetration reach unequivocal oceanic layer 2; at {{the other}} sites, only off-axis sills and flows were sampled. Petrographic observations indicate that back-arc basalts from the Shikoku Basin, {{with the exception of}} the kaersutite-bearing <b>upper</b> <b>sill</b> at Site 444, are mineralogically similar to basalts being erupted at normal mid-ocean ridges. However, the Shikoku Basin basalts are commonly very vesicular, indicating a high volatile content in the magmas. Site 446 in the Daito Basin penetrated a succession of 23 sills which include both kaersutite-bearing and kaersutite-free basalt varieties. A total of 187 samples from the four sites has been analyzed for major and trace elements using X-ray-fluorescence techniques. Chemically, the basalts from Sites 442 and 443 and the lower sill of Site 444 are subalkaline tholeiites and resemble N-type ocean-ridge basalts found along the East Pacific Rise and at 22 ° N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), although they are not quite as depleted in certain hygromagmatophile (HYG) elements. They do not show any chemical affinities with island-arc tholeiites. The basalts from Site 446 and from the <b>upper</b> <b>sill</b> at Site 444 show alkaline and tholeiitic tendencies, and are enriched in the more-HYG elements; they chemically resemble enriched or E-type basalts and their differentiates found along sections of the MAR (e. g., 45 °N) and on ocean islands (e. g., Iceland and the Azores). Most of the intra-site variation may be attributed to crystal settling within individual massive flows and sills, to high-level fractional crystallization in sub-ridge magma chambers, or, where there is evidence of a long period of magmatic quiescence between units, to batch partial melting. However, the basalts from Sites 442 and 443 and from the lower sill at Site 444 cannot easily be related to those from Site 446 and the <b>upper</b> <b>sill</b> at Site 444, and it is possible that the different basalt types were derived from chemically distinct mantle sources. From comparison of the Leg 58 data with those already available for other intra-oceanic back-arc basins, it appears that the mantle sources giving rise to back-arc-basin basalts are chemically as diverse as those for mid-ocean ridges. In addition, the high vesicularity of the Shikoku Basin basalts supports previous observations that the mantle source of back-arc-basin basalts may be contaminated by a hydrous component from the adjacent subduction zone...|$|E

Here, we investigate the thermal effects of widespread (c. 20, 000 km 2) intrusive magmatism on the thermal evolution of organic-rich sedimentary rocks on the non-volcanic Newfoundland passive margin. ODP 210 - 1276 (45. 41 °N, 44. 79 °W) intersects two sills: an older, <b>upper</b> <b>sill</b> and a younger, lower sill that are believed to correspond to the high amplitude “U-reflector” observed across the Newfoundland Basin. A compilation of previous work collectively provides; 1) emplacement depth constraints, 2) vitrinite reflectance data and 3) 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates. Collectively, these datasets provide {{a unique opportunity to}} model the conductive cooling of the sills and how they affect thermal maturity of the sedimentary sequence. A finite differences method was used to model the cooling of the sills, with the model outputs then being entered into the EASY%Ro vitrinite reflectance model. The modelled maturation profile for ODP 210 - 1276 shows a significant but localised effect on sediment maturity {{as a result of the}} intrusions. Our results suggest that even on non-volcanic margins, intrusive magmatism can significantly influence the thermal evolution in the vicinity of igneous intrusions. In addition, the presence of widespread sills on non-volcanic passive margins such as offshore Newfoundland may be indicative of regional-scale thermal perturbations that should be considered in source rock maturation studies...|$|E

The goal of drilling on this non-volcanic margin was to study the rifting, nature of basement, and post-rift sedimentation in the Newfoundland-Iberia rift. Drilling of this 1739 m hole was terminated 90 - 160 m above basement, in the lower of a doublet of alkaline diabase sills. We have carried out geochemical studies of the sill complex, in the hopes that they will provide proxy information regarding the nature of the underlying basement. Excellent 40 Ar/ 39 Ar plateau ages were obtained for the two sills: <b>upper</b> <b>sill</b> ~ 105. 3 Ma; lower sill ~ 97. 8 Ma. Thus the sills are substantially younger than the presumed age of the seafloor at site 1276 (~ 128 Ma), and were intruded beneath substantial sediment overburden (250 m for the upper, older sill, and 575 m for the lower younger sill). While some of the geochemistry of the sills has been compromised by alteration, the "immobile" trace elements show these sills to be hawaiites, differentiated from an enriched alkaline or basanitic parentage. Sr, Nd and Pb isotopes are suggestive of an enriched hotspot/plume mantle source, with a possible "added" component of continental material.

Drilling at Site 462 however, revealed the presence of a thick volcanic complex made up of a lower sheet-flow unit and an <b>upper</b> <b>sill</b> unit which engulfed and intruded Cretaceous sediments. The igne-ous complex is entirely normally magnetized, indicating that it probably was emplaced during the Cretaceous long nor-mal magnetic event which spans the period 80 to 112 m. y. ago. A ̂ Ar-^Ar date from a sill is 110 ± 3 m. y. However, the lower flow unit is probably Barremian. A displaced reef fauna containing a Campanian-Maestrichtian pseudor-bitoidid assemblage was found in a volcaniclastic section that represents the final episode of Cretaceous volcanism in the Nauru Basin-Marshall Islands area. The probable sequence of volcanic events at Site 462 appears to be (1) forma-tion of the underlying Pacific Plate 148 m. y. ago, (2) extrusive volcanism in Barremian time, about 115 m. y. ago, (3) sill and flow volcanism accompanied by edifice-building in late Aptian time, about 110 m. y. ago, and (4) a further episode of edifice-building and deep-water volcanism beginning in the Campanian and ceasing by the middle Maestrichtian, about 70 m. y. ago. Application of models relating lithospheric uplift and subsidence to volcanism developed by Crough (1978) and Detrick and Crough (1978), combined with sedimentological and paleontological evidence from Site 462, allows a semi-quantitative reconstruction of the vertical tectonic history of the Nauru Basin.

40|$|High core {{recovery}} at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 210, Site 1276, {{provided a}} high-resolution porosity-depth relationship and an equally impressive age-depth model based on {{first and last}} occurrences of microfossils. Site 1276 was drilled over transitional crust in the Newfoundland nonvolcanic margin, offshore Canada, between known continental crust on the west and apparent oceanic crust on the east as identified by seafloor-spreading magnetic anomalies M 3 to M 0 (Barremian–Aptian, 129. 8 – 124. 8 Ma). At Site 1276, two diabase sills were drilled at depths equivalent to the U reflection, a bright reflection that overlies transitional crust interpreted from seismic reflection profiles throughout the Newfoundland Basin. The sills were emplaced within uppermost Aptian fine- to coarse-grained sediments, 100 – 200 m above basement as estimated from seismic reflection data. Magma emplacement occurred at shallow levels within the sediment column, as evidenced by: (1) the occurrence of vesicles in the sill, and (2) compaction-induced folding of calcite veins that were emplaced near vertically in the sediments and {{are assumed to be}} coeval with the intrusion. By calculating the degree of shortening of the calcite veins and determining the reconstructed porosity of the sediments during vein emplacement, the age of magma emplacement can be deduced. From the porosity-age curve, the age of sill emplacement is estimated to be 82. 5 – 109. 1 Ma, consistent with recent 40 Ar/ 39 Ar radiometric dating of the <b>upper</b> <b>sill</b> that gave ages of 105. 95 ± 1. 78 Ma and 104. 7 ± 1. 7 Ma. The source of magmatism responsible for the diabase sills is necessarily postrift, and the sills are temporally equivalent to alkali basalts dredged from the Newfoundland Seamounts.

5000|$|Sills {{parallel}} beds (layers) and foliations in {{the surrounding}} country rock. They can be originally emplaced in a horizontal orientation, although tectonic processes may cause subsequent rotation of horizontal sills into near vertical orientations. Sills can be confused with solidified lava flows; however, there are several differences between them. Intruded sills will show partial melting and incorporation of the surrounding country rock. On both contact surfaces of the country rock into which the sill has intruded, evidence of heating will be observed (contact metamorphism). Lava flows will show this evidence only on the lower side of the flow. In addition, lava flows will typically show evidence of vesicles (bubbles) where gases escaped into the atmosphere. Because sills generally form at shallow depths (up to many kilometers) below the surface, the pressure of overlying rock prevents this from happening much, if at all. Lava flows will also typically show evidence of weathering on their <b>upper</b> surface, whereas <b>sills,</b> if still covered by country rock, typically do not.|$|R

The Zhongkui Flow is highly fractionated to form a spinifex zone with lower MgO (5. 3 - 5. 9 wt%) and a cumulate zone with higher MgO (17. 3 - 17. 9 wt%). Overall the rocks have TiO 2 = 0. 44 - 0. 74 wt%. Relative to primitive mantle, they are enriched in Th and LREE, but exhibit negative Ti-, Nb-, and P-anomalies. These features are consistent with their formation from a crustally-contaminated komatiitic magma. During this process of crustal contamination, the magmas assimilated sulfur from sediments, which caused sulfide-segregation resulting in the formation of Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfide deposits.

40|$|AbstractThe Poya Terrane of New Caledonia is a {{composite}} lithotectonic unit made of i) Campanian-Paleocene E-MORB and BABB-type basalts and abyssal argillite (Poya Terrane Basalts); and ii) Coniacian-Santonian sandstone, turbidites and abyssal argillite (Kone Facies) intruded by Early Eocene E-MORB sills. Remapping reveals that the Kone Facies is more extensive than previously thought. Petrography and detrital zircons provenance show that Kone Facies sediments have the same provenance as coeval autochthonous sediments, albeit with more abundant contemporaneous zircons. They accumulated on the eastern continental slope of the Norfolk Ridge, and eventually mixed with abyssal argillite. Temporally, sill emplacement is related to subduction inception at ca. 56 Ma. We postulate that either: i) E-MORB intrusion was related to transcurrent thinning of the down going plate; or, ii) the “enriched” (off axis?) partial melt zone of the ancient ridge swept the lower plate, generating E-MORBs in the <b>upper</b> crust, and <b>sills</b> in passive margin sediments before it became extinct. Sliced marginal basin upper crust, and thereafter passive margin sediments and associated dolerites were obliquely accreted to the fore-arc, and partially subducted and recrystallized into the blueschist facies.

40|$|The study aims to {{elucidate}} {{the processes that}} caused the deposition of a unique fine-grained sediment layer {{at the onset of}} the last deglacial basically along the western Svalbard margin and the western Yermak Plateau. Grain-size analyses of 11 sediment cores west and north off Svalbard and the Yermak Plateau reveal an exceptionally fine-grained sediment layer that was deposited within a relatively short period of 300 years during the Bølling interstadial. The layer was found in cores located below the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC) that conveys Atlantic (AW) and mixed water masses northwards along the continental slope. The mixed waters are underlain by Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDW, water depth > 1000 m). North of Svalbard the <b>upper</b> 500 m (<b>sill</b> depth) branch off and flow in easterly direction to form the Svalbard Branch of the WSC. Further north the Yermak Slope Current (YSC, water depth: 1000 to 1500 m) advects NSDW towards the Arctic Ocean where it quickly loses its signature north of the Yermak Plateau. The studied fine-grained layer reveals a sortable-silt mean grain size of 15 to 20 µm. The fineness of this layer is basically the result of a coarse-silt subpopulation between 36 and 63 µm that is absent in this layer but present throughout most of the cores. As yet the sediment layer was found in 32 sediment cores (mostly published data) from 75 °N to 82 °N at water depths ranging from 300 m (Kveithola) to 1880 m (Yermak slope) south, west and north of Svalbard. Very low magnetic susceptibility, a distinct decrease in Ca-ratios and slightly increased Ti-ratios are further key characteristics for the investigated layer (XRF analyses of 4 cores). AMS age determinations of another 4 cores show a doubled to ten-fold increased sedimentation rate for the period of deposition of this layer. The greatest thickness of the fine-grained layer appears in sediment cores from 1400 to 1500 m water depth and decreases in cores deeper than 1600 m and cores shallower than 1100 m water depth (except for Kveithola), respectively. Thus, the fine-grained material was transported northwards in a relatively narrow strip along the western Svalbard and Yermak slopes. The distribution and thickness of the investigated sediment layer can be linked to both, the rapid melting of the Svalbard and the Barents Sea ice sheets in response to the intense warming {{at the onset of the}} Bølling period. Since Kveithola trough is assumed to be fully deglaciated since 14. 7 cal. years BP a sediment source in the adjacent Barents Sea as well as from local fjords of Spitsbergen is likely.
