50|$|If {{the puzzle}} is <b>only</b> {{scrambled}} <b>using</b> 180° twists, {{then it is}} obviously solvable <b>using</b> <b>only</b> 180° twists. However, if some jumbling moves were made, even if the puzzle was subsequently returned to cube shape, {{it may not be}} possible to solve it <b>using</b> <b>only</b> 180° twists. The {{reason for this is that}} <b>using</b> <b>only</b> 180° twists, each face center piece can only be permuted within a 6-member cycle, often referred to as its orbit. Face center pieces in different orbits cannot be interchanged <b>using</b> <b>only</b> 180° twists. However, jumbling moves are able to permute face center pieces between different orbits, thus leaving the puzzle in a state that cannot be solved by 180° twists alone.|$|R

5|$|The α-chemokine SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, {{suppresses}} {{replication of}} T-tropic HIV-1 isolates.

HIV that <b>use</b> <b>only</b> the CCR5 receptor are termed R5; those that <b>use</b> <b>only</b> CXCR4 are termed X4, and those that use both, X4R5. However, the use of coreceptor alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4+ T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels.|$|E

The strategist also served as Holt's campaign manager in the California 22nd Congressional district Republican primary. Senator Nixon endorsed Holt over State Senator Jack Tenney, and Chotiner asked Nixon to supply him with Tenney's House Un-American Activities Committee file—the state senator had once had communist leanings, though he had long renounced them. Nixon arranged for Chotiner to get the file, {{which was supposed to}} be for Congressional <b>use</b> <b>only,</b> though he apparently made no public use of the file in the campaign.

5|$|In the 16th century, Adriaan van Roomen {{solved the}} problem using {{intersecting}} hyperbolas, but this solution does not <b>use</b> <b>only</b> straightedge and compass constructions. François Viète found such a solution by exploiting limiting cases: {{any of the three}} given circles can be shrunk to zero radius (a point) or expanded to infinite radius (a line). Viète's approach, which uses simpler limiting cases to solve more complicated ones, is considered a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius' method. The method of van Roomen was simplified by Isaac Newton, who showed that Apollonius' problem is equivalent to finding a position from the differences of its distances to three known points. This has applications in navigation and positioning systems such as LORAN.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of its breed surveys and monitoring, the Conservancy has found {{significant}} changes in the populations of several swine breeds. The Berkshire breed has increased significantly in number, partially due to international demand for its meat, while other breeds have shown significant decreases, most likely due to increasing consolidation of the pork industry to large producers who <b>use</b> <b>only</b> a few specialized pork strains. Breeds such as the Chester White and Poland China have seen population numbers reduced by over 25 percent between 1998 and 2003, while the Hampshire and Yorkshire breeds have decreased by more than 30 percent in the same time.|$|E

The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division at Grave required two lifts while the British 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem would need three lifts. Whereas the two American divisions delivered at least three quarters of their infantry in their first lift, the 1st Airborne's similar drop used only half its infantry capacity and the remainder to deliver vehicles and artillery.|$|E
