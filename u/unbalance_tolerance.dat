50|$|Dynamic balance {{describes}} the forces generated by asymmetric mass distribution when the tire is rotated, usually {{at a high}} speed. In the tire factory, the tire and wheel are mounted on a balancing machine test wheel, the assembly is accelerated up to a speed of 100 RPM (10 to 15 mph with recent high sensitivity sensors) or higher, 300 RPM (55 to 60 mph with typical low sensitivity sensors), and forces of unbalance are measured by sensors as the tire rotates. These forces are resolved into static and couple values for {{the inner and outer}} planes of the wheel, and compared to the <b>unbalance</b> <b>tolerance</b> (the maximum allowable manufacturing limits). If the tire is not checked, {{it has the potential to}} wobble and perform poorly. In tire retail shops, tire/wheel assemblies are checked on a spin-balancer, which determines the amount and angle of unbalance. Balance weights are then fitted to the outer and inner flanges of the wheel. Dynamic balance is better (it is more comprehensive) than static balance alone, because both couple and static forces are measured and corrected.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Vibration {{caused by}} mass {{imbalance}} in rotating machinery {{is an important}} engineering problem. The objective of balancing is to reduce rotor vibration to a practical minimum. Reducing rotor vibrations generally increases the service life of the rotating machinery. The fundamental difference between a centrifugal sewage pump impeller and those of its clear water cousins {{is its ability to}} pass solid materials that would normally clod later. Due to the unbalance in the impeller, vibration occurs and leads to decrease in fluid velocity and local pressure which may cause an undesirable turbulence and possible cavitation. Hence, to remove the unbalance in rotor is necessary. In this paper the focus is given on dynamic balancing of centrifugal pump impeller.

40|$|LecturePg. 129 - 143 From {{time to time}} {{vibration}} probes pick up high vibration at the coupling location on output shafts. Many times the coupling will then be removed {{and sent to the}} shop or to the manufacturer for inspection, repair, and rebalancing. In many of these cases, especially with dry couplings, however, the root cause is elsewhere [1]. The coupling vibration-and sometimes damage can be a symptom of other problems in the train. What these vibrations mean is addressed as related to the coupling and vibration signature. Is it the coupling, or is the rotor out of balance? Or, is there a problem with the fit between the two? What else could be wrong? Field cases are presented where suspected coupling problems turned out to be something entirely different. In one case, an axially vibrating coupling {{turned out to be the}} result of a resonance condition in the feedback loop in the controller of a variable frequency motor. This resonance caused a torsional vibration that showed up axially in the coupling. In another case, three different high performance disc and two different high performance gear couplings were installed before a vibration problem was traced to pipe strain induced misalignment. Other cases are presented, including some where the coupling actually was the problem. Moreover, coupling balancing is covered, especially as it relates to the overall rotor balance condition. How can you be assured that a coupling balanced at the factory will still be in balance when installed in the field? What is the importance of balancing tolerances and how significant are they when referenced to the out of balance due to fits and clearances? It is shown that the setup indication tolerances are a more significant contributor to overall coupling balance than actual balance machine <b>unbalance</b> <b>tolerances.</b> All of the cases presented involve dry couplings-ones that don't have lubricated gear teeth. On almost all new high performance turbomachinery applications, dry couplings have replaced the gear type, and one of the reasons for this is the general lack of coupling problems associated with the dry couplings (except for an occasional wind age problem). There are usually no wearing parts, and there are less clearances (like in gear tooth mesh), which can lead to significant unbalance and vibration in sensitive applications...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{interest}} in the synchronous reluctance machines is growing up due to their several merits in comparison to other machine types. These machines offer high torque density {{with respect to the}} induction machines. Their torque density is slightly lower than permanent magnet synchronous machines even though the lower performance is compensated by a much cheaper rotor. Since synchronous reluctance machines do not induce voltage when the stator is not supplied, there are not short circuit currents and braking torques due to the electrical faults, e. g. they have high fault tolerant capability. In addition, synchronous reluctance machine has a robust structure, and a wide constant power speed range. For these aforementioned reasons, these machines are employed in several applications. However, there is a prominent defect of this kind of machines which is the low power factor. This defect is addressed by assisting the motor by permanent magnets within the flux barriers of the rotor leading to the permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motor. In addition, these kinds of machines has high torque ripple. This is due to the high harmonic content in the magneto motive force which interacts with the rotor anisotropy. Several approaches are proposed to reduce the torque ripple, such as: (a) using skewed rotor, (b) adopting two different flux-barrier geometries in the same lamination, i. e., asymmetric rotor, (c) using equally spaced the flux-barrier ends along the rotor periphery, and (d) optimization approaches were applied to smooth the torque. The synchronous reluctance machine is becoming of great interest in the last years, due to two key reasons: (i) the increase of rare earth permanent magnet cost and (ii) the increasing request of high-efficiency machines. Therefore, the reluctance motor and the ferrite permanent assisted reluctance motor are becoming competitors of both surface-mounted permanent magnet machines and induction machines in many applications. Such motors are also becoming particularly interesting when the control is based on the sensor-less rotor position detection. Even if there is a great interest in this kind of machines, there is a few work about the analytical design of their rotor, e. g. about how to select the end barrier angles, designing the iron ribs, and designing the permanent magnet robust towards the demagnetization. In the majority of the cases the reluctance machine is analyzed by using finite element analysis. The results are precise and useful for achieving a specific geometry to be prototyped, but they refer to that particular solution and they lose generality. In other words, it is difficult to find general rules to design reluctance machines, since the analysis approach is focused on a single objective. During the manufacturing process, there are some manufacturing imprecision, such as mass <b>unbalance,</b> bearing <b>tolerance,</b> shaft bow, and etc., cause eccentricity fault. Eccentricity may cause magnetic and dynamic problems with additional vibrations, noises, and torque pulsations. Although the eccentricity faults in induction and permanent magnet motors are extensively investigated, there are a few publications on synchronous reluctance machines with eccentricity. It is important to study the effect of rotor eccentricity on these machines because of their high anisotropy and critical iron parts in the rotor (iron ribs). For the aim of designing the iron ribs thicknesses, the unbalanced magnetic force acting on theses ribs should be accurately estimated. Main contribution of the thesis This thesis aims to give an useful analytical approach for reaching a preliminary geometry of both synchronous reluctance and permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motors, as starting point for a successive optimization. For more accurate design of the rotor iron ribs, the electro-magnetic force acting on the rotor, in different rotor eccentricity cases, are analytically computed. In addition, a comparative studies (analytically and FE) between the synchronous reluctance, permanent magnet assisted, and surface mounted permanent magnet machines, in different eccentricity cases, is carried out. Therefore, this thesis is divided into four main parts. At the first part, an analytical model based on the magnetic equivalent lumped network of the reluctance motor is discussed. This model studies the magnetic performance of the concentric synchronous reluctance motor. Then, this analytical model is adopted in order to study the impact of different eccentricity scenarios (static and dynamic eccentricity) on the reluctance motor. Different stator windings configurations (distributed and concentrated windings) and different rotor geometries (symmetric and asymmetric rotor) are considered. After that, the eccentric synchronous reluctance machine is compared with the eccentric permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance machine. The impact of the barrier dimensions, the rotor geometry, and the permanent magnet type is highlighted in this comparison. Furthermore, an analytical comparison between the reluctance motor and the surface mounted permanent magnet motor is carried out in different cases of eccentricity. The axial non uniform displacement of the rotor axis from the stator axis, at one end and both ends of the axis, are involved in this analytical comparison. The second part aims to achieve more realistic estimation of the electromagnetic forces acting on the rotor by considering the effect of stator slots and the magnetic voltage drop due to the actual B-H curve of the motor iron. The analytical model is developed for both eccentric and concentric synchronous reluctance motor. Then, an experimental validation of the analytical and FE analysis is carried out. At the third part, an analytical approach for designing the permanent magnet of the permanent magnet assisted reluctance motor is proposed. The width and the thickness are selected so as to achieve the desired no-load air-gap flux density and resist the demagnetization under the desired loading conditions, respectively. Both complete and simplified analytical analyses are discussed. In addition, the analytical approach is presented in both cases of neglecting and considering the rotor iron ribs. Then, from the previously mentioned three parts of this thesis, a rapid multi-objectives analytical approach is proposed to achieve the initial design of the synchronous reluctance and permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motors. Finally, at the fourth part, a graphical user interface application for concentric and eccentric synchronous reluctance motor is developed. This application estimates stator and rotor scalar magnetic potential, air-gap flux density, electromagnetic torque, magnetic force acting on the rotor. The input parameters of this application are - the geometrical data of the stator and rotor, - the electric loading (kA/m), the electric load angle in (electric degree), - the rotor geometry type, e. g., symmetric or asymmetric rotor geometry, - number of flux-barriers per rotor pole, - eccentricity type or no eccentricity, e. g., healthy case, - the eccentricity value. Then, the user can run the application to estimate the magnetic performance of both concentric and eccentric synchronous reluctance motor. ...|$|R
