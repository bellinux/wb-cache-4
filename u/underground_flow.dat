50|$|To {{the east}} of the Shannon, the {{limestone}} is often covered by great thicknesses of glacial drift deposited during the last glacial period, but in many areas {{to the west of the}} Shannon where the limestone is pure and the drift cover is thin, there is no proper surface river network. In these areas, rainfall disappears underground, flows through openings in the rock and then rises at distant springs: large springs can be found to the west of the area, flowing into Lough Corrib and Galway Bay. In winter, when the underground water level (or water table) rises, and when the <b>underground</b> <b>flow</b> increases, and when the <b>underground</b> <b>flow</b> routes to the springs are not capable of dealing with the amount of water entering them, groundwater may appear temporarily at the surface in the form of a turlough.|$|E
50|$|Ground {{water is}} found in rock {{fractures}} and to a limited extend in porous rocks, in the upper 40 meters.

In the actual context of accelerate economic development, the excessive exploatation {{of water resources}} from the underground and the contamination of these with different water pollutants {{has become a major}} problem which has enetered the attention of many researchers. For the evaluation of an <b>underground</b> water <b>flow</b> and pollutants transport sistem we have chosen the package of programs MODFLOW which includes a whole series of applications,such as MOC 3 D, MT 3 D, MT 3 DMS, PEST, UCODE, PMPATH, which allow simulations and multiple recalibrations of the capacity of recharging of the aquifers, the flowing of the water towards wells and drillings the transport of a pollutant agent in the underground or the evaluation of the exchange of water between the hidrographic network and aquifers.

50|$|After a total <b>underground</b> <b>flow</b> of some 30 km, {{the waters}} of the sinking Fatnička reka re-appear as a series of very {{powerful}} cave springs near the town of Bileća, which are joined into one river, the Trebišnjica, the most important river in eastern Hercegovina. The river flows to the south, through the depression of Miruša. On the southernmost part of the depression, the river is dammed by the Grancarevo Dam at the village of Gornje Grančarevo and completely flooded upstream by the artificial Lake Bileća. Nearly all of the eastern bank of the lake belongs to Montenegro.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the city}} is in the valley of the Santa Ynez River, at an {{elevation}} of about 80-100 feet (25-30 meters); recent expansion has been to the north, on higher ground known as Vandenberg Village, with elevations of 150-300 feet (50-100 meters). Like most rivers in Southern California, the Santa Ynez River does not have a surface flow for most of the year. <b>Underground</b> <b>flow</b> in the sandy river bed recharges the aquifer beneath the city, from which nine wells (with a tenth one planned) supply the city with water.

50|$|The use of {{the river}} for {{irrigation}} in the Salinas Valley makes {{it one of the}} most productive agricultural regions in California. It is especially known as one of the principal regions for lettuce and artichokes in the United States. The river is shallow above ground, periodically dry, with much of its flow underground. The <b>underground</b> <b>flow</b> results from numerous aquifers, which are recharged by water from the Salinas, especially from the Nacimiento and San Antonio lakes during the dry months. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the river valley provided the route of El Camino Real, the principal overland route from southern to northern Alta California, used by Spanish explorers and missionaries and early Mexican settlers.|$|E

30|$|Academically and {{technically}} sounder {{research is}} important to understand the complete picture of the problem, but requires time and money, the limited availability of which may hinder rapid progress. Furthermore, assessing a more complete picture is difficult due to the numerous uncertainties with respect to <b>underground</b> <b>flows,</b> the technical conditions of tube wells, and climate change. Given these problems, individuals and communities have to become more aware and prepare themselves. The study demonstrated the possible contribution of participatory monitoring and how local people can be empowered to tackle this kind of problem themselves.|$|R
5000|$|The River Poddle, a {{tributary}} of the Liffey in its own right, was linked with the River Dodder from Balrothery Weir, just north of Firhouse, from the 13th century. This link formerly provided much of Dublin City's water supply. Known as the [...] "City Watercourse," [...] it ran through part of Templeogue. It was partly piped in the mid-20th century, and the connection was later broken by housing development. All that remains now are a small channel from the weir, dead-ending less than 100m from the weir, and some unseen <b>underground</b> <b>flows.</b>|$|R
50|$|After an <b>underground</b> <b>flow</b> {{of about}} one kilometer, the stream resurfaces in the {{neighborhood}} of Medaković II, but one kilometer later, {{in the neighborhood of}} Marinkova Bara, it goes underground again. Formerly, it used to flow through the neighborhoods of Dušanovac, Autokomanda and Jatagan Mala. The area in the lower valley of the now underground stream was used for digging earth and gravel which were used to cover and drain the swamps on the Sava's right bank, so that neighborhoods of Savamala and Bara Venecija could be constructed, and for the building of Belgrade's central railway station. After the works were completed, the area around Mokroluški potok was left as a steep, elongated cut in the ground and so was given its present name (Prokop).|$|E
50|$|Ras al-Ayn {{is located}} in the Upper Khabur basin in the {{northern}} Syrian region of Jazira. The Khabur River, largest tributary of the Euphrates, crosses the border from Turkey near the town of Tell Halaf, just about 4 km to the southwest of the city. The overground feeders, originating on the headwaters of the Karaca volcano in Şanlıurfa Province, however usually don't carry water in the summer, even though Turkey brings in water from the Atatürk reservoir to irrigate the region of Ceylanpınar. While more than 80% of the Upper Khabur's water originates from Turkey, this mostly comes as <b>underground</b> <b>flow.</b> So rather than the overground streams, it's the giant karstic springs of the Ras al-Ayn area that is considered the river's main perennial source.|$|E

The fact that the French painter Louis-François Cassas (1782) was commissioned to paint some landscape pieces also proves that in the 18th century the caves were {{considered one of the most}} important natural features in the Trieste hinterland.
