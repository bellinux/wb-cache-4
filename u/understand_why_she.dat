5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E
25|$|While Mary {{manages the}} children, other {{problems}} lie with their parents. Winifred {{is aware that}} she is somehow disappointing both her children and her husband ("Being Mrs Banks"). George, on the other hand, can't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> finds the role of wife and mother so difficult ("Cherry Tree Lane (reprise)"). In an effort to please her husband, Winifred sends out invitations for a smart tea party. Mrs. Brill makes the preparations, while telling an eager Robertson Ay to keep his hands off. The children inadvertently sabotage the kitchen preparations, but Mary sorts {{it out with a}} lesson ("A Spoonful of Sugar"). However, it is then revealed that none of the invitees are coming.|$|E
25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not <b>understand</b> <b>why,</b> <b>she</b> thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E

5000|$|Asia Corvino as Samantha Ferri (seasons 1-3), who is pretty, but {{not very}} clever. She loves shoes and the color pink. No one <b>understands</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> is Linda's friend.

25|$|Working with Mona and Sara, {{the girls}} finally {{infiltrate}} A's lair, where they discover a live feed of Alison coming {{face to face}} with Charles, who is revealed to be CeCe Drake. CeCe then begins to explain her story and motives, revealing that she was born as Charles, but was not accepted by her father for believing she was a girl. She was sent to Radley, where she eventually transitioned into Charlotte. She also explains what led to Mrs. Cavanaugh's death at the hands of Bethany Young, her complicated relationship with Bethany and her subsequent death, the events regarding the night Alison disappeared, the deal she made with Mona, the events at the burning lodge, Wilden's death, the events in New York, and their mother's death. She explained that she did everything just to be closer to her family, and she became 'A' when she thought that the Liars were happy about Alison's 'death', so she wanted to make them suffer for it but couldn't stop the game because she grew obsessed with it. Cece also reveals that Sara is both the other Red Coat and The Black Widow, working under CeCe's orders, leaving Emily distraught. CeCe heads for the roof to commit suicide (after her bomb attempt fails and Emily subdues Sara), but Alison and the girls convince her to stop, saying they now <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> became 'A'. CeCe then surrenders and declares the game over. On Labor Day weekend, the girls say goodbye as they are leaving for college except for Alison who stays in Rosewood.|$|E
500|$|Blair {{is largely}} {{motivated}} by matters surrounding family, romance, and ambition. However, her tendency to overachieve {{can lead to}} feelings of paranoia, with dramatic or comical results. In a review for The New Yorker, Janet Malcolm remarked that Blair's issues made her [...] "both a broader caricature and a more real person" [...] than the other Gossip Girl characters. In a 2009 interview, Gossip Girl creator Cecily von Ziegesar claimed to identify with Blair the most, stating, [...] "She is so unpredictable and dramatic. Such a bitch, but we <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> is a bitch and we like her anyway".|$|E
500|$|Sarah Polley as Elise. Polley was {{the first}} to be cast in the film. She {{describes}} Elise as [...] "a young woman who carries a lot of love inside her. She yearns to be the best of mothers but just can't do it. She's frustrated because of this inability to live the way she would like to live, all of this stemming from her depression. She doesn't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> can't pull out of it. Over time she develops a feeling of shame and guilt towards her husband and her children." [...] Actress Clare Stone portrays Elise at fifteen.|$|E
5000|$|According to her Internet diary at nancycrick.com (now defunct), Nancy {{spent most}} of her time on the toilet.

60|$|Down {{over the}} hill was Hugh Blair's place. When we came to it, Hester turned in at the gate. Then, for the first time, I <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> had come back, and a {{blinding}} flash of joy broke over my soul. I {{stopped and looked at}} her. Her deep eyes gazed into mine, but she did not speak.|$|R

500|$|During {{a feature}} on fictional {{television}} teachers, Susan was praised by teaching website TES Connect. Along with Will Schuester from American television show Glee, TES {{said that there}} are some teachers on television who manage to portray [...] "convincing representations of the highs and lows of the job". They also added [...] "Susan Kennedy from Neighbours manages to be the comforting mother figure as well as coming down hard when necessary". The Times named Susan's amnesia storyline as one of their top 15 most memorable Neighbours moments. They said [...] "She slipped on milk, bumped her head and thought she was 16 again. Her failure to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> was living with a family on Ramsay Street lasted nearly a year". Television channel Five's Holy Soap website also named the storyline as Susan's most memorable moment, calling it [...] "classic viewing".|$|E
500|$|Amy {{is a happy}} {{character}} with a mischievous personality. As Amy grew up in foster care it shows in her persona. Though it is often {{hard for people to}} <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> acts wayward, she also has the vulnerability factor. Halfpenny said she likes Amy's mischievous side and hoped she would not learn to be sensible. Halfpenny also felt it was important that Amy remained youthful because she disliked portrayals of teenagers growing up too quickly. She found it easy to portray a character younger than herself as she could base aspects of Amy's story on her own teenage experience. At times she is scared she puts on a [...] "hard exterior". Amy has a distinct style, Halfpenny described it as being quite [...] "out there" [...] in her choice of clothing and make-up. Halfpenny said that viewers would not be getting used to Amy's [...] "nice side" [...] and reminded them that she is good at [...] "lying and scheming". She concluded that Amy's bad side was due to resurface.|$|E
500|$|Blackwoods actress Keegan Connor Tracy played Kat Jennings. Tracy {{claimed that}} [...] " [...] doesn't really buy it at first, but pretty soon even her cynical {{attitude}} can't ignore {{the truth of}} the situation they're all in." [...] Perry defined the role as [...] "someone who is really so self-absorbed that without being overly malicious is incredibly rude and insensitive to the feelings of all those around her." [...] Her casting was assessed by Perry as [...] "full of energy" [...] and [...] "embodies the self-aware nervous energy of Kat. [...] created a character that you kind of dislike intensely but you don't dislike so much that you don't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> is the way she is." [...] Rounding up the cast are Lynda Boyd (Rachel Todd in You, Me and the Kids) as widow Nora Carpenter and James Kirk (Kyle Morgan in Once Upon a Christmas) as her son Tim Carpenter, David Paetkau (Hunter Kerrigan in Just Deal) as gambler Evan Lewis, Justina Machado (Vanessa Diaz in Six Feet Under) as pregnant Isabella Hudson, and Noel Fisher (Todd Tolanski of [...] ) as farmer Brian Gibbons.

Andrew Airlie portrayed Kimberly's father Michael Corman, while Enid-Raye Adams appeared as Dr. Ellen Kalarjian.|$|E
60|$|To {{this day}} I never fully <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> thus risked her {{interest}} {{for the sake of}} Dr. John. What people said, of course I know well: the whole house--pupils, teachers, servants included--affirmed {{that she was going to}} marry him. So they had settled it; difference of age seemed to make no obstacle in their eyes: it was to be so.|$|R
60|$|Hutter was {{inwardly}} much {{moved by}} the conduct of Hetty, though he affected so much indifference of manner. He recollected her gentle appeal to him {{before he left the}} Ark, and misfortune rendered that of weight which might have been forgotten amid the triumph of success. Then he knew the simple, single-hearted fidelity of his child, and <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> had come, and the total disregard of self that reigned in all her acts.|$|R
60|$|And {{with the}} silence came thought, and {{a blaze of}} {{understanding}} that flashed upon her and made all things clear. <b>She</b> <b>understood</b> now <b>why</b> <b>she</b> had closed her ears.|$|R
500|$|The {{film was}} {{scheduled}} to premiere at RKO's flagship theater Radio City Music Hall on February 14, but in early January 1941 Welles was not finished with post-production work and told RKO that it still needed its musical score. Writers for national magazines had early deadlines and so a rough cut was previewed for a select few on January 3, 1941 for such magazines as Life, Look and Redbook. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (and Parsons' arch rival) showed up to the screening uninvited. Most of the critics at the preview said that they liked the film and gave it good advanced reviews. Hopper wrote negatively about it, calling the film a [...] "vicious and irresponsible attack on a great man" [...] and criticizing its corny writing and old fashioned photography. Friday magazine ran an article drawing point-by-point comparisons between Kane and Hearst and documented how Welles had led on Parsons, Hollywood correspondent for Hearst papers. Up until this Welles had been friendly with Parsons. The magazine quoted Welles as saying that he couldn't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> was so nice to him and that she should [...] "wait until the woman finds out that the picture's about her boss." [...] Welles immediately denied making the statement {{and the editor of}} Friday admitted that it may be false. Welles apologized to Parsons and assured her that he had never made that remark.|$|E
500|$|Shannon's flashbacks in [...] "Abandoned" [...] {{were used}} to allow the {{audience}} {{to get to a}} [...] "really emotional level with the character, [...] finally <b>understand</b> ... <b>why</b> <b>she</b> was the way she was." [...] Her death was planned before the start of season two, as the producers wanted the survivors in the tail section of the plane and the survivors of the fuselage to be forced to come together under difficult circumstances. Her death was also used to [...] "spin Sayid off in another direction." [...] Damon Lindelof commented [...] "It's sort of understood on Lost that that's what you sign up for. There's going to be constant character turnover, because the stakes on the Island are life-or-death." [...] Lindelof felt an [...] "intense, emotional sense of loss" [...] when watching her death. In her post-death appearance in [...] "Collision," [...] Maggie Grace was credited as [...] "special guest star." [...] She received the same billing when she returned in season three, appearing in Nikki and Paulo's flashbacks. Carlton Cuse noted [...] "it was really fun for us to actually have Boone and Shannon reemerge in the stories." [...] Shannon was originally in [...] "LA X", the season premiere for the sixth and final season, but had to be written out as Grace was unavailable. The producers eventually arranged for Grace to appear in [...] "The End".|$|E
500|$|The New Directions closing {{number at}} Sectionals, [...] "Valerie", {{received}} the most commentary, with Santana's solo given enthusiastic praise, though Brittany and Mike's dancing was also lauded. Hankinson, who had tepidly called songs [...] "nice" [...] up to this point, shifted gears and said, [...] "Then Santana burns the roof down with a rendition of Amy Winehouse's 'Valerie'. It was awesome." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal echoed that fervor: [...] "But then Santana came on and killed. With an on-spot rendition of Mark Ronson/Amy Winehouse's 'Valerie,' and wearing a Snooki bun, Santana was electrifying behind the mic, in an energizing display that revved up the audience", and added, [...] "Brittany and Mike's pas de deux rocked". Benigno opined that [...] "Brittany and Mike Chang handle the moves (extraordinarily well), but the vocals here are what steal it. Naya Rivera (Santana) is completely outstanding on lead vocals, and I can't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> hasn't gotten a solo before this"; he gave it an [...] "A". Stack was slightly less generous with an [...] "A-", and wrote {{that it was a}} [...] "great song choice for Santana"; he gave [...] "bonus points for the phenomenal Mike/Brittany choreography", while Harper said that their dancing [...] "totally made the song". Nguyen liked the dancing, but she was critical of how the song sounded, as she felt [...] "it lacked something and didn't really feel worthy of the standing O", while Futterman said [...] "Santana's sassy vocals are a perfect echo of Winehouse's, {{but the rest of the}} song feels a bit like a circus". Reiter felt the entire song [...] "seemed kind of tacked on", both the dancing and Santana's solo.|$|E

60|$|For two {{or three}} weeks after the picnic Charnock did not meet Sadie. The rebuff he had got did not rankle much, and was rather provocative than daunting, but he <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> had told him he made her cheap. She meant to keep her caresses for her husband or {{declared}} lover, and if he wanted her, he must pay the regular price. This was very proper, from her point of view, but from his the price was high.|$|R

500|$|After Gilly {{eventually}} {{starts a}} relationship with Steph, she is diagnosed with cervical cancer and initially keeps the news a secret from him. Stenson spoke of Steph's reasoning stating: [...] "With Gilly, she's embarrassed and doesn't want him to look after her." [...] Speaking of the storyline Quinlan stated during an interview with Inside Soap: [...] "I think Gilly's really gutted that he didn't get together with Steph sooner - he wasted so much time with Cheryl and Jem, when really {{he was in love}} with her." [...] At one point Steph cancels her wedding to Gilly because he cannot accept she is dying, of this Quinlan states: [...] "His denial is not helping her. She's tying to take this in her stride and wants to spend quality time with the people she loves before she goes. She tells him he has to accept she's going to die or the wedding is off. and she hands back her engagement ring." [...] Quinlan has also stated he was eager for the pair to marry because of the [...] "tear jerking" [...] scenes it would create. Steph is killed off during a special week of episodes dubbed [...] "fire week". The cast filmed many stunts themselves, and Quinlan filmed scenes in front of a burning set, and he stated he [...] "was very manly about it" [...] whilst filming a ladder rescue scene. Gilly's immediate grief resulted in the characters name trending on Twitter, of this Quinlan stated: [...] "So glad that the ep had the impact that was desired! Buzzing Gilly is trended again!" [...] Gilly's grief is made worse because of Steph making the decision to die prematurely. Conversing this Quinlan said: [...] "He's grieving - he just can't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> took her life like that." [...] He added that Gilly's grief turns to anger because he cannot get the answers to his questions. Quinlan opined that he wanted Gilly to take a different root stating: [...] "I'd like to see Gilly go down a bit of a different route because he’s been a bit of a push-over in the past. I'd like to see his character progress a bit more and I'd like to see a side of him that we haven't seen before." [...] Gilly's grief then continued to get worse with Quinlan adding: [...] "The poor guy's heading off on a very dark journey that I'm sure he'll live to regret." [...] As Gilly is still so angry, at Steph's funeral, the director of the episode asked Quinlan not to cry at all during the ceremony. Quinlan added [...] "It was all so heartfelt, though, that I broke down for real a few times - and I think that's going to come across in the final episode." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{writer who}} {{produced}} a novel around {{the figure of}} Artemisia might be George Eliot in Romola (1862–63), where some aspects of Gentileschi's story, while set in Florence in Gentileschi's time, are recognizable, but much embroidered. A later and clearer use of Gentileschi's story is by Anna Banti, wife of Roberto Longhi. Her first draft of the manuscript, dated 1944, was lost during the war. Three years later she started again with the book, to be entitled Artemisia, writing in a much different form. Banti's book is written in an [...] "open diary" [...] form, in which she maintains a dialogue with Artemisia, trying to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> finds her so fascinating.|$|E
