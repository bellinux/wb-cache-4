5|$|House mice {{use both}} audible and <b>ultrasonic</b> {{calls in a}} variety of contexts. Audible vocalizations can often be heard during agonistic or {{aggressive}} encounters, whereas ultrasound is used in sexual communication and also by pups when they have fallen out of the nest.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} welding process, forge welding, some modern welding methods {{do not involve}} the melting of the {{materials}} being joined. One of the most popular, <b>ultrasonic</b> welding, is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure. The equipment and methods involved are {{similar to that of}} resistance welding, but instead of electric current, vibration provides energy input. Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure. When welding plastics, the materials should have similar melting temperatures, and the vibrations are introduced vertically. <b>Ultrasonic</b> welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.|$|E

5|$|The {{cylinder}} is inspected externally for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations {{and excessive}} wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, corrosion damage, illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and unauthorised additions or modifications. Unless the cylinder walls are examined by <b>ultrasonic</b> methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination {{to identify any}} damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as <b>ultrasonic</b> measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.|$|E
5|$|Tympanal organs {{or hearing}} organs {{consist of a}} {{membrane}} (tympanum) stretched across a frame backed by an air sac and associated sensory neurons, are found in two families. Several species of the genus Cicindela (Carabidae) have hearing organs on the dorsal surfaces of their first abdominal segments beneath the wings; two tribes in the Dynastinae (within the Scarabaeidae) have hearing organs just beneath their pronotal shields or neck membranes. Both families are sensitive to <b>ultrasonic</b> frequencies, with strong evidence indicating they function to detect the presence of bats by their <b>ultrasonic</b> echolocation.|$|E

5000|$|The IEEE Transactions on <b>Ultrasonics,</b> Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control (TUFFC) is a {{prestige}} peer-reviewed archival {{journal of}} the UFFC Society.

In May 1955, the name was changed to “IRE Transactions on <b>Ultrasonics</b> Engineering”; in 1963, it adopted the name “IEEE Transactions on <b>Ultrasonics</b> Engineering”, and in 1964, the name became “IEEE Transactions on Sonics and Ultrasonics”.

50|$|Picosecond <b>ultrasonics</b> {{is a type}} of <b>ultrasonics</b> {{that uses}} ultra-high {{frequency}} ultrasound generated by ultrashort light pulses.

25|$|<b>Ultrasonic</b> force {{microscopy}} {{allows the}} local mapping of elasticity in {{atomic force microscopy}} by the application of <b>ultrasonic</b> vibration to the cantilever or sample.

25|$|Brown rats {{are capable}} of {{producing}} <b>ultrasonic</b> vocalizations. As pups, young rats use different types of <b>ultrasonic</b> cries to elicit and direct maternal search behavior, {{as well as to}} regulate their mother's movements in the nest. Although pups will produce ultrasounds around any other rats at 7 days old, by 14 days old they significantly reduce ultrasound production around male rats as a defensive response. Adult rats will emit <b>ultrasonic</b> vocalizations in response to predators or perceived danger; the frequency and duration of such cries depends on the sex and reproductive status of the rat. The female rat will also emit <b>ultrasonic</b> vocalizations during mating.|$|E

25|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} operation used to cut keyways into shafts. Electron beam machining (EBM) is a machining process where high-velocity electrons are directed toward a work piece, creating heat and vaporizing the material. <b>Ultrasonic</b> machining uses <b>ultrasonic</b> vibrations to machine very hard or brittle materials.|$|E
25|$|In a mouse FOXP2 {{knockout}} study, loss of both {{copies of}} the gene caused severe motor impairment related to cerebellar abnormalities and lack of <b>ultrasonic</b> vocalisations normally elicited when pups are removed from their mothers. These vocalizations have important communicative roles in mother-offspring interactions. Loss of one copy was associated with impairment of <b>ultrasonic</b> vocalisations and a modest developmental delay. Male mice on encountering female mice produce complex <b>ultrasonic</b> vocalisations that have characteristics of song. Mice that have the R552H point mutation carried by the KE family show cerebellar reduction and abnormal synaptic plasticity in striatal and cerebellar circuits.|$|E
