Information {{of speech}} units like vowels, consonants and syllables {{can be a}} kind of {{knowledge}} used in text-independent Short Utterance Speaker Recognition (SUSR) in a similar way as in text-dependent speaker recognition. In such tasks, data for each speech unit, especially at the time of recognition, is often not enough. Hence, it is not practical to use the full set of speech units because some of the units might not be well trained. To solve this problem, a method of using speech unit categories rather than individual phones is proposed for SUSR, wherein similar speech units are put together, hence solving the problem of sparse data. We define Vowel, Consonant, and Syllable Categories (VC, CC and SC) with Standard Chinese (Putonghua) as a reference.
