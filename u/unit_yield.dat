40|$|AbstractCotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) {{production}} in China has developed rapidly {{during the last}} 60 years. In 2012, the planting area and total output in the country were 5. 3 million hectares and 7. 62 million tons, respectively, and the <b>unit</b> <b>yield</b> was 85 % higher than the world average. China currently accounts for about 30 % of the world's cotton output with only 15 % of the world's cotton land. Enhanced cotton production, particularly the high <b>unit</b> <b>yield</b> {{is largely due to}} adoption of a series of intensive farming technologies and cultural practices. The intensive farming technologies for cotton {{production in}} China mainly include seedling transplanting, plastic mulching, double cropping, plant training and super-high plant density technique, which have played important roles in promoting <b>unit</b> <b>yield</b> and total output. Although such intensive farming technologies meet the need of a growing population under limited arable land in China, they are labor-intensive and involve large input of various kinds of chemical products like fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic films. Thus, there are increasing challenges from soil pollution and labor shortage. Here, the achievements, challenges, countermeasures and prospects for intensive cotton cultivation in China are reviewed. An important conclusion from this review is that the establishment of a new farming technology through reform of the current intensive technology is inevitable to support sustainable cotton production in the nation. A series of comprehensive countermeasures should be taken to reduce soil pollution through rational use of plastic film and chemicals, labor saving through simplifying field managements and mechanization and increasing benefits by reforming the cropping system and management mode. China's cotton production would be sustainable with a bright prospect if supported by new farming technologies...|$|E

One farm is located near Oxnard, California, USA {{and the other is}} located near Gilroy, California, USA. Both of these growers farm about 162 hectares (400 acres) in their overall operations and used the loans to purchase subsurface drip irrigation systems for Peppers. Over 4 million in low-interest loans have been made available to California growers from the California Energy Commission (CEC) since 1986. The CEC initiated the loan program for growers to help implement energy conservation practices. The primary findings ofthis paper include: I) The growers needed a two to three year learning curve to solve basic problems. They continually adapt to new challenges by trying different approaches to management and hardware. 2) The nature of problems will change from year to year. 3) Peppers have an excellent yield response to drip irrigation.

40|$|The ventral spinal roots {{contain the}} axons of spinal motoneurons {{and provide the}} only {{location}} in the peripheral nervous system where recorded neural activity can be assured to be motor rather than sensory. This study demonstrates recordings of single unit activity from these ventral root axons using floating microelectrode arrays (FMAs). Ventral root recordings were characterized by examining single <b>unit</b> <b>yield</b> and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) with 32 -channel FMAs implanted chronically in the L 6 and L 7 spinal roots of 9 cats. Single unit recordings were performed for implant periods of up to 12 weeks. Motor units were identified based on active discharge during locomotion and inactivity under anesthesia. Motor <b>unit</b> <b>yield</b> and SNR were calculated for each electrode, and results were grouped by electrode site size, which were varied systematically between 25 - 160 μm to determine effects on signal quality. The unit yields and SNR {{did not differ significantly}} across this wide range of electrode sizes. Both SNR and yield decayed over time, but electrodes were able to record spikes with SNR > 2 up to 12 weeks post-implant. These results demonstrate that it is feasible to record single unit activity from multiple isolated motor units with penetrating microelectrode arrays implanted chronically in the ventral spinal roots. This approach could be useful for creating a spinal nerve interface for advanced neural prostheses, and results of this study will be used to improve design of microelectrodes for chronic neural recording in the ventral spinal roots...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to analyze the characteristics and major factors influencing yield variability of a number of major crops in China from 1981 to 2010. Based on data for yield and sown area of a crop, four methods were used to separate crop trend yield and meteorological yield from actual yield. There was an association between total <b>yield</b> and per <b>unit</b> area <b>yield</b> for all major crops over the past 30 years in China. The per <b>unit</b> area <b>yields</b> of fruits increased more rapidly than other crops, and was about 7. 09 % for citrus fruit annually. The trend yield for different crops also increased year by year. However, meteorological yield fluctuated greatly with greatest fluctuations occurring for fruits (17. 76 % for citrus and 15. 83 % for apple). The contributions of sown area and per <b>unit</b> area <b>yield</b> to variability of total yield varied among the major crops. For grains and fruits, the contribution of per <b>unit</b> area <b>yield</b> had the dominant effect, while the opposite was the case for sugar crops and cotton. For oil crops both factors contributed almost equally. The variability in per <b>unit</b> area <b>yield</b> of all crops could be largely attributed to variability of meteorological factors. Social factors, such as agricultural policy and improved technology, played relatively lesser roles. The four methods used in the analysis showed no significant differences. The contributions of the above factors to yield variability were species dependent. To ensure agricultural production security, more attention should be paid to enhance the per <b>unit</b> area <b>yield</b> of crops together with the impact of climate change on yields...|$|R

40|$|The spinal nerves, {{consisting}} of ventral roots and dorsal root ganglia, are a novel target for motor and sensory interfaces for neural prosthetic limbs. By implanting floating microelectrode arrays (FMA) into the spinal nerves, {{it is possible}} to record single unit activity from motor axons in the ventral roots (VR) or microstimulate sensory fibers in the dorsal roots and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The ventral roots remain a lesser-explored electrophysiological target for motor control of a neuroprosthetic device. Long term acquisition of high quality neural recordings is necessary for neuroprosthetic applications and electrical interface impedance measurements are often used as a diagnostic tool to evaluate electrode integrity. However, it is not well understood how electrode impedance affects the quality of single unit recordings, particularly in the spinal nerves where few chronic recording studies have been performed. This study characterizes ventral root recordings by examining signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and single <b>unit</b> <b>yield</b> for chronically implanted microelectrode arrays in cats. Two 32 -channel floating microelectrode arrays (FMA, MicroProbe, Inc.) were implanted into the L 6 and L 7 ventral roots of 9 cats during sterile surgery. Single unit recordings were performed during treadmill locomotion and under anesthesia. All recorded units were classified as motor or sensory by heuristic metrics after all data was manually spike sorted. For all motor-related units, SNR and single <b>unit</b> <b>yield</b> were calculated for each electrode. The SNR and yield measures were grouped by electrode site size to examine the effect of site size and electrode impedance on recording quality. The electrode site exposures ranged from 25 to 160 µm, yielding initial impedance values in the range of 50 - 500 kΩ. As expected, electrode impedances were inversely correlated with site size. However, SNR and yield did not differ significantly across this wide range of electrode sizes; peaks in both probability of unit detection and median SNR values did not consistently fall within a particular range of impedances. Both SNR and yield decay over time, as expected, but all electrodes recorded spikes with SNR > 2 out to 12 weeks post-implant. Results from this study are being used to improve the design and specifications of exposed tip lengths of microelectrodes for chronic neural recording in spinal nerves...|$|E
