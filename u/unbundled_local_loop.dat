40|$|Unbundling {{consists}} of the possibility for a new operator to have special access to an incumbent's network infrastructure {{in order to provide}} value-added services without the necessity to duplicate the infrastructure itself. <b>Local</b> <b>loop</b> <b>unbundling</b> has received the most attention in Europe and in Italy. Most Italian operators are interested mainly in physical access to copper loop, which gives the opportunity to offer broadband services pervasively by exploiting the capabilities of xDSL technology.

Unlike the costs of a copper access networks, those of an NGA are not yet sunk; hence fixed monopoly suppliers need an incentive to invest. This need is likely to influence the regulator's unbundling and access pricing regime, including application of the 'ladder of investment', which encourages competitors {{to develop their own}} infrastructure. This paper considers how the ladder is affected by NGAs, taking account of both the changed network architecture of NGAs, which may remove the <b>unbundled</b> <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> access point, and problems associated with providing an incentive to take the copper network out of use.

40|$|The {{telecommunications}} {{market was}} completely open to competition in 1998 in Spain, {{as in most}} EU countries. The model for the liberalization of the market {{was based on the}} regulated use of the incumbent operators' network, so that new entrants could initially use these resources to allow for a soft entry in the market, by climbing a 'ladder of investment'. However, as late as 2011, no entrant operator had gone beyond the <b>Unbundled</b> <b>Local</b> <b>Loop</b> deploying its own access network. This changed in Spain in 2012, when Jazztel decided it would invest in deploying Fibre-to-the-Home. Later, Orange and Vodafone announced that they have reached an agreement to share the deployment of fibre to 6 Millions of households. This phenomenon has coincided in time with the lack of regulated wholesale access on Telef 3 nica FTTH network for speeds above 30 Mbps.

This report, developed using the expertise of both the Australian Communications and Media Authority and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, {{discusses the}} availability of broadband, fixed voice, mobile voice and mobile data in the community. Key findings identified in the report include: * The number of broadband subscribers increased by 1. 1 million in the 12 months to June 2008. This increase was driven by growth in wireless broadband (47 per cent) and DSL provided on unbundled services (33 per cent). Unbundled services are the <b>unbundled</b> <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> service (ULLS) and the line sharing service (LSS). * Broadband connection speeds are rising with a 25 per cent increase in subscribers using a 1. 5 Mbps service, predominantly {{as a result of}} evolution from ADSL 1 to ADSL 2 + services. * Mobile services are evolving from second generation (2 G) to third generation (3 G) mobile with 8. 55 million 3 G services in operation at June 2008 (an increase of 88 per cent). * Fixed voice remains a large part of consumers? spend on communications services and the number of fixed lines remained stable in the year to June 2008 at 11 million fixed line services in operation.

40|$|Abstract: The New Regulatory Framework (NRF) for {{electronic}} communications {{was intended to}} usher {{in an era of}} harmonised regulation across the European Union leading to better choice, price and quality for European consumers. The European Commission has voiced its frustration at the fragmented nature of the implementation of the NRF. In this paper I examine whether the NRF has indeed been introduced in a fragmented manner and whether that fragmentation affects consumers, taking broadband penetration, which is regarded as desirable both socially and economically, as the measure of consumer outcome. I find that a causal relationship exists between public policy, prices of <b>unbundled</b> <b>local</b> <b>loops,</b> market concentration and adoption of broadband. Using a Lagged Dependent Variable model, I find that decreasing concentration in the market structure of broadband access technologies at retail level has a strong effect on the take-up of broadband, with the effect taking time to be fully realised. To enhance consumer adoption of broadband, therefore, policy makers in the EU should seek to improve the opportunity for broadband competition...|$|R

We find that Italy is behind {{compared to the other}} OECD countries in both broadband penetration rate and average available speed. The main determinants of this delay are the scarce diffusion of PCs and the persistently low ICT alphabetization of the Italian population, the geographical and density characteristics of the country as well as strategic factors (market structure and bureaucratic constraints). Finally, we examine the main regulations and policy instruments that have been established to foster broadband diffusion and we provide policy indications aimed at improving average quality and reducing digital-divide. broadband, digital divide, <b>unbundling</b> <b>local</b> <b>loop,</b> shared access, bitstream...|$|R

40|$|The common idea of {{open access}} {{policy is that}} {{it refers to the}} sharing of {{particular}} elements, such as wholesale access networks, backhaul, under-sea cable and internet exchange points in fixed and mobile networks. In broadband networks, the use of open access policy usually refers to the infrastructure parts, which are considered a bottleneck. Many regulators have generally focused open access policy on fixed broadband networks, especially digital subscriber line (DSL) technology, in the last decade. <b>Local</b> <b>loop</b> <b>unbundling</b> (LW) regulation {{is one of the main}} strategies for the regulator to open access to an incumbent's bottleneck network in order to soften its monopoly power and encourage competition in the DSL broadband market. The OECD countries have different strategies regarding <b>unbundling</b> <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> and infrastructure competition, as the characteristics and infrastructure networks of countries vary. There are currently more choices of next generation network (NGN) technologies to develop. While <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> <b>unbundling</b> may not be applied fully to NGN development (the cost is not sunk, more technologies are available to implement, incentive of investment by operator), it can indicate benefits and drawbacks of open access policy in the past decade that can be adapted to NGN. The empirical results of this study show that during 2002 - 2008, LLU regulation was one of the strategies used to increase broadband adoption in countries that had difficulty encouraging infrastructure competition. Unbundling regulation can therefore be implemented carefully and differently in each country that has inefficiency that is harmful to consumers in its market from a monopoly incumbent. Infrastructure competition, on the other hand, is introduced as another strategy to increase broadband adoption. The empirical results of this study indicate that infrastructure competition can be used as a strategy when there are already enough infrastructures in the area or country. These results support the idea of using open access and infrastructure competition policy depending on the existing competition of broadband infrastructure in each country...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{means to}} add to {{empirical}} research {{on the impact of}} <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> <b>unbundling</b> (LLU) on broadband networks. In particular, it focuses on broadband investment made by entrants. Starting from late Nineties telecommunications incumbents of several European Union countries have been required to <b>unbundle</b> their <b>local</b> <b>loops.</b> While there is a general consensus on the negative or null impact of unbundling obligations on incumbents' investment, research on the relationship between LLU and new entrants' investment, albeit growing, has not yet reached a coherent body of results. We have tested two propositions. First, service-based entry, which relies on LLU, paves the way to new entrants' subsequent investment in broadband systems (i. e. ladder of investment theory). Second, the price charged for <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> should increase over time {{in order to have a}} significant investment in alternative platforms (i. e. the transitory entry assistance theory). The empirical analysis is carried out on a sample of 27 European countries (2002 - 2009 period). We have collected country-level data on broadband lines and LLU policy indicators. The preliminary results suggest that service-based entry does not lead entrants to a subsequent facility-based entry, casting some doubts on the ladder of investment theory. The short ladder version of the theory has received confirmation instead. At the same time, an increasing price of <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> is not found to stimulate the entrants' investment in alternative broadband networks.

40|$|One of {{the early}} {{decisions}} facing a regulator {{in the context of}} an open access Next Generation Access networks (NGA) is the location of the points of interconnection to that NGA. This decision is one which needs to take into account the scope of the natural monopoly associated with an NGA and the extent to which there is the potential for competitive supply of transmission services (or backhaul) from access seeker points of presence to the NGA. The Australian NGA is called the National Broadband Network (NBN). This paper starts with the research question, where are the optimum sites for points of interconnection to the Australian NBN?. The paper commences by describing the architecture of the Australian NBN and considering some of the issues which arise from the fact that it is designed to be ubiquitous. The paper considers the issues that need to be considered in determining the extent to which there is a natural monopoly in transmission services as well as the effects on outcomes that arise from the existing deployment of infrastructure associated with the delivery of digital subscriber line broadband services based on <b>unbundled</b> <b>local</b> <b>loops</b> and line sharing services. The paper then moves to consider the requirements for consideration in the Australian regulatory context. This is summarised by the phrase long-term interests of end-users and the paper considers the interpretation of this phrase in the context of decisions on the number and location of points of interconnection. There is a review of the nature and extent to which operators in Australia contributed to the deliberations of the Australian regulator in determining the location of points of interconnection. In turn the paper then describes the actual approach taken in respect of the Australian NBN and the rationale behind those decisions. The final part of the paper describes the decision that was taken along with the rationale. It also examines the subsequent positions taken by stakeholders in respect of the points of interconnection to the Australian NBN.
