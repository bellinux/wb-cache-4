After a brief career in teaching, and having spent time in Finland, Kilburn was appointed cricket correspondent at the Yorkshire Post after impressing the editor with his writing. A serious man, he had an <b>unusual</b> <b>way</b> of writing his reports, but his editors refused to change his copy, so highly did they value his impact.|$|E
5|$|So far {{some success}} has been {{achieved}} in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. A superfluid is a system of electrically neutral atoms that flows without any friction. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using liquid helium, but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing lasers. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase {{the intensity of the}} lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an <b>unusual</b> <b>way.</b> For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the temperature and on Planck's constant, the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other phases. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole.|$|E

25|$|When Demetrius {{arrived in}} Babylon, Seleucus was {{somewhere in the}} east. He had left Patrocles to defend the city. Babylon was defended in an <b>unusual</b> <b>way.</b> It had two strong fortresses, in which Seleucus had left his garrisons. The {{inhabitants}} of the city were transferred out and settled in the neighboring areas, some as far as Susa. The surroundings of Babylon were excellent for defense, with cities, swamps, canals and rivers. Demetrius' troops started to besiege the fortresses of Babylon and managed to conquer one of them. The second fortress proved more difficult for Demetrius. He left his friend Archelaus to continue the siege, and himself returned west leaving 5,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry in Babylon. Ancient sources do not mention what happened to these troops. Perhaps Seleucus had to reconquer Babylon from Archelaus.|$|E

25|$|In 1923, {{extracts}} {{from all three}} Henry VI plays were broadcast on BBC Radio, performed by the Cardiff Station Repertory Company as the third episode {{of a series of}} programs showcasing Shakespeare's plays, entitled Shakespeare Night. In 1947, BBC Third Programme aired a one-hundred-and-fifty-minute adaptation of the trilogy as part of their Shakespeare's Historical Plays series, a six-part adaptation of the eight sequential history plays, with linked casting. Adapted by Maurice Roy Ridley, King Henry VI starred John Byron as Henry and Gladys Young as Margaret. Almost the entirety of 1 Henry VI was cut, with everything related to the conflict in France being removed. In 1952, Third Programme aired an adaptation of the tetralogy by Peter Watts and John Dover Wilson under the general name The Wars of the Roses. The tetralogy was adapted into a trilogy but in an <b>unusual</b> <b>way.</b> 1 Henry VI was simply removed, so the trilogy contained only 2 Henry VI, 3 Henry VI and Richard III. The adaptation starred Valentine Dyall as Henry and Sonia Dresdel as Margaret. In 1971, BBC Radio 3 presented a two-part adaptation of the trilogy by Raymond Raikes. Part 1 contained an abridged 1 Henry VI and an abridged version of the first three acts of 2 Henry VI. Part 2 presented Acts 4 and 5 of 2 Henry VI and an abridged 3 Henry VI. Nigel Lambert played Henry, Barbara Jefford played Margaret, Francis de Wolff played Talbot and Elizabeth Morgan played Joan. In 1977, BBC Radio 4 presented a 26-part serialisation of the eight sequential history plays under the general title Vivat Rex (long live the King). Adapted by Martin Jenkins as part of the celebration of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, 1 Henry VI comprised episodes 15 ("Joan of Arc") and 16 ("The White Rose and the Red"). James Laurenson played Henry, Peggy Ashcroft played Margaret, Clive Swift played Talbot, Hannah Gordon played Joan, and Richard Burton narrated.|$|E

Pollock arrived first and the transfer ceremony took place on March 31, 1917, on Saint Thomas. Blerer officiated at a smaller ceremony on Saint Croix. Present for the handover was the crew of the Danish station cruiser [...] Valkyrien and the former island legislature. The United States declared war on Germany on April 6, {{less than a week after}} securing the islands. Oliver was confirmed by Congress on April 20 and relieved Pollock as governor.|$|E
500|$|James Schellenberg {{writing in}} Challenging Destiny, a Canadian science fiction and fantasy magazine, was {{impressed}} by Shikasta [...] "grand sense of perspective" [...] and the context of humanity set in a [...] "vaster scale of civilization and right-thinking". He liked the concept of SOWF as a [...] "metaphor of community connectedness", but felt it was an <b>unusual</b> <b>way</b> to build a utopia. The book's fractured storytelling leads to Lessing breaking the [...] "famous dictum of writing – show, don't tell", and while that may work in certain circumstances, Schellenberg felt that that approach does not work very well in Shikasta. The online magazine Journey to the Sea found Lessing's inclusion of stories from the Hebrew Bible [...] "entertaining and intriguing", and said she challenges the logical thinker's rejection of these sacred texts, suggesting that it is [...] "imaginatively possible" [...] {{that they could be}} true.|$|E

By 1793, Eickemeyer had been promoted to brigadier general; he served in the Upper Rhine campaigns and the Rhine Campaign of 1796. During this campaign, he also acquired the services of a young officer, Laurent Gouvion, later known as Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr. [...] According to Antoine Marie Chamans, he acquired Saint Cyr's services in an <b>unusual</b> <b>way,</b> indicative of Custine's temperament and personality. In a break in action, Gouvion was sketching the countryside, including the enemy positions near Eckheim, in the vicinity of Mainz, when Custine saw him from a distance. Not approving of his occupation, Custine galloped to him, snatched the paper from his hand, and angrily asked what he was doing. Upon noticing that Gouvion's drawing closely matched the positions, he assigned the young officer to his own staff.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{how most}} actors are trained, St. John {{believed}} that it was not up to the performer to interpret the character, but that a character existed regardless of how an actor played him, which he realized was [...] "an <b>unusual</b> <b>way</b> to approach acting". [...] He also thought that playing Todd was fun and [...] "never boring to watch" [...] because Todd, although popular with the audience, is an unlikable character. St. John told Branco that when people asked him if Todd was capable of harming his loved ones, like his long-time love Blair or daughter Starr, St. John would say that Todd was capable of anything, even being sexually attracted to Starr or one of her friends, because to state otherwise meant that he was [...] "limiting the character". He added, [...] "Todd is a marvelous character to play because he could commit genocide, or find a cure for AIDS. He's full of possibilities—good and bad... See, as an actor that always gives you conflict to play—and that subtext enriches a performance." ...|$|E
500|$|The MAUD Committee {{was founded}} in June 1940. The Committee was {{originally}} {{a part of the}} Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence, but later gained independence with the Ministry of Aircraft Production. The committee was initially named after its chairman, Thomson, but quickly exchanged this for a more unassuming name, the MAUD Committee. The name MAUD came to be in an <b>unusual</b> <b>way.</b> Shortly after Germany invaded Denmark, Bohr had sent a telegram to Frisch. The telegram ended with a strange line: [...] "Tell Cockcroft and Maud Ray Kent". At first it was thought to be code regarding radium or other vital atomic-weapons-related information, hidden in an anagram. One suggestion was to replace the y with an i, producing 'radium taken'. When Bohr returned to England in 1943, it was discovered that the message was addressed to Bohr's housekeeper Maud Ray and Cockcroft. Maud Ray was from Kent. Thus the committee was named The MAUD Committee, the capitalisation representing a codename and not an acronym. Meetings were normally held in the offices of the Royal Society in London. In addition to Thomson, its original members were Chadwick, Cockcroft, Oliphant and Philip Moon. Patrick Blackett, Charles Ellis and William Haworth.|$|E
