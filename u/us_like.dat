5|$|Madonna's {{look and}} style of dressing, her performances, and her music videos {{influenced}} young girls and women. Her style {{became one of the}} female fashion trends of the 1980s. Created by stylist and jewelry designer Maripol, the look consisted of lace tops, skirts over capri pants, fishnet stockings, jewelry bearing the crucifix, bracelets, and bleached hair. Madonna's popularity continued to rise globally with the release of her second studio album, Like a Virgin, in November 1984. It became her first number-one album in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the UK, and the <b>US.</b> <b>Like</b> a Virgin was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold more than 21 million copies worldwide.|$|E

25|$|How {{this city}} marches northward! The {{progress}} of 1835 and 1836 {{was nothing to}} the luxuriant rank growth of this year.

U.S. companies such as Pacific Gas and Electric (PG) have partnered with Habitat for Humanity to provide complete solar grids for a few homes.

25|$|The Platinum Koala {{never reached}} the {{popularity}} of the American Platinum Eagle, mostly because it has not been advertised in the <b>US.</b> <b>Like</b> most investment platinum coins, Platinum Koalas are sealed in a protective plastic case. The coins are sold at prices that reflect the current price of platinum, and not at the face value printed on the coin. Since November 1986, the Perth Mint has used more than 18 tonnes of platinum for minting. About 85% of the coins were sold abroad making the Gold Corporation (owner of the Mint) one of Australia's top 30 export earners.|$|E
25|$|Interscope gave <b>us,</b> <b>like,</b> {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really. We knew that.|$|E

On September 9, 2014, Apple discontinued the iPhone 4S {{as part of its}} annual refresh of the iPhone lineup – in which time the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were introduced – thus making the iPhone 5C the entry-level model complimentary when a two-year contract is signed with a US carrier or $349 off-contract. The 16 & 32GB versions of the iPhone 5C were also discontinued globally, replaced by the 8GB model. However, some carriers in the <b>US</b> <b>like</b> AT kept the 16GB and 32GB models instead of having the 8GB model, thus the 16GB model was $0 (on-contract) and the 32GB was priced between $50–$100 (on-contract). The 8 GB iPhone 5C succeeded the discontinued iPhone 4S as Apple's entry-level smartphone.|$|E

25|$|The worst {{experience}} for Libyan Jews {{in the war}} was the internment of Cyrenaican Jews in Giado, a concentration camp located 235 kilometres from Tripoli. In January 1942, the Italian authorities began to apply Mussolini’s “Sfollamento” order to Libyan Jews. Mussolini ordered the Jews of Benghazi, Derna, Tobruk, Barce, Susa and other towns {{in the region to}} be sent to a concentration camp in Gharian in retaliation. An eyewitness described these horrifying moments: “In the synagogue they started hanging up lists every day of 20-30 families that had to leave...They took Jews from Benghazi and from the vicinity: Derna, Brace, Tobruk...The journey took five days. We travelled about 2,000 km. from Benghazi to Giado. They took <b>us</b> <b>like</b> animals to the slaughter house. Forty people in each truck and each truck had two Italian policemen. They took only Jews. According to the rumour it was the Germans who gave the order”.|$|E
500|$|Though Chamberlain {{struck a}} conciliatory note during the 1926 General Strike, in general he had poor {{relations}} with the Labour opposition. Future Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee complained that Chamberlain [...] "always treated <b>us</b> <b>like</b> dirt", and Chamberlain in April 1927 wrote: [...] "More and more do I feel an utter contempt for their lamentable stupidity." [...] His poor {{relations with the}} Labour Party later played a major part in his downfall as Prime Minister.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, the Nevada {{defense had}} {{difficulty}} stopping the Maryland run. Nevada's rush defense allowed 258yards, compared with its regular-season average of just 74.5yards allowed per game.

Head coach Chris Ault said, [...] "He just ran through <b>us</b> <b>like</b> we weren't there."

50|$|One’s {{ethnicity}} {{can easily}} link {{us to the}} biological vitality and looks {{that we will be}} born with. One’s socio-economic status self-implies your platform of status and resources. And one’s religious or spiritual beliefs can have a hand in how we perceive and treat others around us, and often we tend to be warmer and more trustworthy to those with similar beliefs. All things considered, homogamy is an unsurprising phenomenon of interpersonal relationships regarding the liking and nurturing of others who are <b>like</b> <b>us,</b> may look <b>like</b> <b>us,</b> and act <b>like</b> ourselves.|$|R
5000|$|Appearing on the September 8, 1935 program, {{broadcast}} from the Capitol Theater in New York City, the quartet {{was introduced by}} Major Bowes as [...] "singing and dancing fools".

When it was Sinatra's turn, Tamburro joked, [...] "This feller here has never worked at all". Sinatra said, [...] "I'm Frank. We're looking for a job. How about it?

500|$|Blink-182 first {{performed}} [...] "Feeling This" [...] alongside {{other new}} songs from Blink-182 during their performances at the 2003 Reading and Leeds festivals. The band picked [...] "Feeling This" [...] {{as the first}} single because they felt it representative of the transition they had undergone since their fourth studio album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). A slightly different version of the song had been released previously {{as part of the}} soundtrack for the video game Madden NFL 2004 under the erroneous title [...] "Action". Barker explained in an interview that [...] "'Action' just sounded kind of dorky to <b>us.</b> <b>Like</b> we would always call it 'Feeling This' and then someone at our label, I think, like wrote it as 'Action' one time and sent out singles to people.

500|$|The present life man, O king, {{seems to}} me, in {{comparison}} with that time which is unknown to <b>us,</b> <b>like</b> to the swift flight of a sparrow through the room wherein you sit at supper in winter amid your officers and ministers, with a good fire in the midst whilst the storms of rain and snow prevail abroad; the sparrow, I say, flying in at one door and immediately out another, whilst he is within is safe from the wintry but after a short space of fair weather he immediately vanishes out of your sight into the dark winter from which he has emerged. So this life of man appears for a short space but of what went before or what is to follow we are ignorant. If, therefore, this new doctrine contains something more certain, it seems justly to deserve to be followed.|$|E

500|$|Despite its success, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{had some}} detractors, {{including}} hip hop tastemakers who were unaccustomed to the album's style. [...] As the East Coast and West Coast hip hop scenes were already well-established at the time, many did not view the South {{as a legitimate}} and respectable scene. At the 1995 Source Awards, an award ceremony held by The Source magazine, OutKast won in the [...] "Best Newcomer" [...] category, but were booed upon taking the stage and delivering their acceptance speech; Big Boi managed to deliver his shout outs, while André 3000 was nervous and said, [...] "The South got somethin' to say." [...] The latter recalled how the album was received by some listeners, [...] "People thought that the South basically only had bass music. At first people were looking at <b>us</b> <b>like</b> 'Um, I don't know.'" [...] Taken aback by the backlash, André 3000 and Big Boi channelled their frustration in the studio to improve upon their debut.|$|E

When a similar promotion attempt failed in California, the album was shelved as it was considered not commercial enough for release. Fry recalled, [...] "We'd go in and play it and these guys would look at <b>us</b> <b>like</b> we were crazy". In late 1974, before the album was even named, the band broke up, bringing Big Star's first era to its end. Dickinson later said that he was [...] "nailed for indulging Alex on Big Star Third, but I think {{it is important that the}} artist is enabled to perform with integrity. What I did for Alex was literally remove the yoke of oppressive production that he had been under since the first time he ever uttered a word into a microphone, for good or ill." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1931 Cardus {{visited the}} Salzburg Festival, {{where he met}} Beecham and began a {{friendship}} which lasted until Sir Thomas's death in 1961—despite numerous disagreements. One of Cardus's notices in 1937 so incensed Beecham that he announced he would not conduct any concert at which Cardus was present. Cardus later numbered Beecham, with Elgar and Delius, as [...] "one of the three most original spirits known in English music since Purcell". The annual Salzburg Festival became a highlight of Cardus's musical calendar; in 1936 he saw Toscanini conduct a performance there of Wagner's Die Meistersinger that, he said, [...] "will remain in the mind for a lifetime... Toscanini held <b>us</b> <b>like</b> children listening to a tale told in the chimney corner, lighted by the glow of olden times". Cardus's final prewar Salzburg visit was in 1938, just after the German-Austrian Anschluss {{which led to the}} withdrawal in protest of many of the Festival's leading figures.|$|E
