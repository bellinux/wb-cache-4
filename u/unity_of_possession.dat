5000|$|We {{observed}} that tithes {{are due to}} the parson of common right, unless by special exemption: let us therefore see, thirdly, who may be exempted from the payment of tithes ... either in part or totally, first, by a real composition; or secondly, by custom or prescription.First, a real composition is when an agreement is made between {{the owner of the}} lands, and the parson or vicar, with the consent of the ordinary and the patron, that such lands shall for the future be discharged from payment of tithes, by reason of some land or other real recompence given to the parson, in lieu and satisfaction thereof. ...Secondly, a discharge by custom or prescription, is where time out of mind such persons or such lands have been, either partially or totally, discharged from the payment of tithes. And this immemorial usage is binding upon all parties, as it is in its nature an evidence of universal consent and acquiescence; and with reason supposes a real composition to have been formerly made. This custom or prescription is either de modo decimandi, or de non decimando.A modus decimandi, commonly called by the simple name of a modus only, is where there is by custom a particular manner of tithing allowed, different from the general law of taking tithes in kind, which are the actual tenth part of the annual increase. This is sometimes a pecuniary compensation, as twopence an acre for the tithe of land : sometimes it is a compensation in work and labour, as that the parson shall have only the twelfth cock of hay, and not the tenth, in consideration of the owner's making it for him: sometimes, in lieu of a large quantity of crude or imperfect tithe, the parson shall have a less quantity, when arrived to greater maturity, as a couple of fowls in lieu of tithe eggs and the like. Any means, in short, whereby the general law of tithing is altered, and a new method of taking them is introduced, is called a modus decimandi, or special manner of tithing....A prescription de non decimando is a claim to be entirely discharged of tithes, and to pay no compensation in lieu of them. Thus the king by his prerogative is discharged from all tithes. So a vicar shall pay no tithes to the rector, nor the rector to the vicar, for ecclesia decimas non folvit ecclesiae. But these personal to both the king and the clergy for their tenant or lessee shall pay tithes of the same land, though in their own occupation it is not tithable. And, generally speaking, it is an established rule, that in lay hands, modus de non decimando non valet. But spiritual persons or corporations, as monasteries, abbots, bishops, and the like, were always capable of having their lands totally discharged of tithes, by various ways: as#By real composition :#By the pope's bull of exemption :#By <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> as when the rectory of a parish, and lands in the same parish, both belonged to a religious house, those lands were discharged of tithes by this <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> :#By prescription having never been liable to tithes, by being always in spiritual hands :#By virtue of their order; as the knights templars, cistercians, and others, whose lands were privileged by the pope with a discharge of tithes. Though, upon the dissolution of abbeys by Henry VIII, most of these exemptions from tithes would have fallen with them, and the lands become tithable again; had they not been supported and upheld by the statute 31 Hen. VIII. c.13. which enacts, that all persons who should come to the possession of the lands of any abbey then dissolved, should hold them free and discharged of tithes, in as large and ample a manner as the abbeys themselves formerly held them. And from this original have sprung all the lands, which, being in lay hands, do at present claim to be tithe-free: for, if a man can shew his lands to have been such abbey lands, and also immemorially discharged of tithes by any of the means before-mentioned, this is now a good prescription de non decimando. But he must shew both these requisites for abbey lands, without a special ground of discharge, are not discharged of course neither will any prescription de non decimando avail in total discharge of tithes, unless it relates to such abbeylands.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the higher}} courts in Queensland {{have had the}} {{opportunity}} to revisit the effect of severance on a joint tenancy. The cases allow for the opportunity to examine in more depth the nature of joint tenancy itself, and the concept of alienation as a means of severance of joint tenancy. This article provides an analysis of these decisions to ascertain the contemporary 'state of play' in the law applying to severance of a joint tenancy. A joint tenancy is characterised by the four <b>unities</b> - <b>of</b> <b>possession,</b> interest, title and time! – together with the right of survivorship. Given this characterisation, severance of a joint tenancy represents a fundamental change in the nature of the co-ownership. In particular, the destruction of the right of survivorship through severance will by definition change the potential of each co-owner to hold the whole of the estate in severalty upon the death of the other co-owners. The nature of the common ownership of a joint tenancy, and the potential that it carries, can be adjusted by converting, or severing, the joint tenancy to create a tenancy in common. Unlike a joint tenancy, a tenancy in common is characterised by each tenant holding a distinct interest in the property; the shares may be in different proportions. ...|$|R

40|$|Joint tenancy and tenancy {{in common}} are {{for all intents and}} {{purposes}} the only means of co-ownership of real or personal property in Western Australia. Joint tenants hold the whole property jointly and nothing separately. Tenants in common, on the other hand, have a distinct share in the property. There are two essential features that distinguish a joint tenancy from a {{tenancy in common}}. The first feature is the right of survivorship: upon the death of one joint tenant his interest in the property is extinguished and the interest of the surviving joint tenants is correspondingly enlarged. Upon the death of a tenant in common his interest in the property passes under his will or intestacy. The second feature is the presence of four unities: in order for there to be a joint tenancy there must be unity of title, interest, time and possession. Although the four unities may be present in a tenancy in common, the only unity which is essential is <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession...</b>|$|E

40|$|Our talk today {{considers}} the issues facing a {{trustee in bankruptcy}} when attempting to ascertain the extent or existence of a bankrupt's interest in real property. We will highlight issues which a trustee might reasonably encounter in ascertaining the extent of property available for distribution to creditors. We will consider two elements in particular {{in light of the}} recent decision of the High Court in Cummins (a bankrupt) v Cummins, and the Federal Court in Anderson v Peldan. Both cases involved an examination of joint tenancy. Joint tenancy is one way for two or more co-owners to hold their estate in common. It will only arise where there is a <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> time, title, <b>possession</b> and interest between co-owners, and then only where there is an intention to hold as such (Property Law Act Qld provides for a presumption in favour of tenancy in common). The joint tenancy provides each co-owner the right to survivorship - upon the death of an owner that owner's estate is extinguished and the estate of surviving co-owners are enlarged proportionately to the extent of the deceased's estate. This occurs irrespective of the deceased’s testamentary wishes. Anderson v Peldan concerned the severance by an insolvent of joint tenancy held by the insolvent and his elderly spouse and whether the severance before death is capable of being a “transfer of property” in terms of s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act...|$|R

I streamline this solution and bring it up to date. I contrast this conventionalist theory with Frege’s unsaturatedness theory. I show that Frege’s theory is mystical, ad hoc, ineffective and paradoxical, and that it entails that singular terms cannot be predicates. I argue that the conventionalist account is free of these defects and that it provides a clear and intelligible solution to the problem <b>of</b> the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the sentence. I suggest that the problem <b>of</b> the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the proposition is spurious. I recommend that the notion of unsaturatedness be extruded from serious debate.
