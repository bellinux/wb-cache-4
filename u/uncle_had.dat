5|$|By 1675 George's eldest <b>uncle</b> <b>had</b> died without issue, but his {{remaining}} two uncles had married, putting George's inheritance in jeopardy as his uncles' estates might pass {{to their own}} sons, should they have had any, instead of to George. George's father took him hunting and riding, and introduced him to military matters; mindful of his uncertain future, Ernest Augustus took the fifteen-year-old George on campaign in the Franco-Dutch War with the deliberate purpose of testing and training his son in battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Como left Canonsburg, {{moving about}} 100 miles away to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where his <b>uncle</b> <b>had</b> a barber {{shop in the}} Hotel Conneaut. Around 80 miles from Cleveland, it was a popular stop on the {{itinerary}} for dance bands who worked {{up and down the}} Ohio Valley. Como, Roselle, and their friends had gone to nearby Cleveland; their good times took them to the Silver Slipper Ballroom where Freddy Carlone and his orchestra were playing. Carlone invited anyone who thought he might have talent to come up and sing with his band. Young Como was terrified, but his friends urged him and pushed him onto the stage. Carlone was so impressed with Como's performance that he immediately offered him a job.|$|E
5|$|Kumaritashvili, {{who first}} began to {{participate}} in luge when he was 13, came {{from a family of}} seasoned lugers: his grandfather had introduced the sport to the Soviet republic of Georgia, and both his father and <b>uncle</b> <b>had</b> competed when they were younger, with his uncle later serving {{as the head of the}} Georgian Luge Federation. Kumaritashvili himself began competing in the 2008–09 Luge World Cup. Kumaritashvili had also been a student at the Georgian Technical University, where he earned an economics degree in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Like Ladislaus I, Coloman {{proved to}} be a great legislator, but he {{prescribed}} less severe punishments than his <b>uncle</b> <b>had</b> done. He ordered that transactions between Christians and Jews were to be put into writing. His laws concerning his Muslim subjects aimed at their conversion, for instance, by obliging them to marry their daughters to Christians. The presence of Jewish and Muslim merchants in the kingdom was due to its role as a crossroad of trading routes leading towards Constantinople, Regensburg and Kiev. Local trade also existed, which enabled Coloman to collect the marturina, the traditional in-kind tax of Slavonia, in cash.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of King Henry in 1189, the new King Richard I {{appointed}} Walter Bishop of Salisbury; the election took place on 15 September 1189 at Pipewell, with the consecration on 22 October 1189 at Westminster. Also elected to bishoprics at this council were Godfrey de Lucy to the see of Winchester, Richard FitzNeal to the see of London, and William Longchamp to the see of Ely. The elevation of so many new bishops was probably meant to signal the new king's break with his father's habit of keeping bishoprics empty to retain the revenues of the sees. At {{about the same time}} Glanvill was either forced out of his justiciarship or resigned, but the sources are unclear. Walter was probably elevated to a bishopric even though his <b>uncle</b> <b>had</b> lost some of his power because of political manoeuvring over the elevation of King Richard's illegitimate half-brother Geoffrey to the see of York, which Walter had at first opposed. The bishopric was either a reward or a bribe for Walter's withdrawal of his objections to Geoffrey's election.|$|E
5|$|Anna Mae had {{an older}} sister, Ruby Aillene. As young children, Anna Mae and Aillene were {{separated}} when their parents relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee, {{to work at}} a defense facility during World War II. Anna went to stay with her strict, religious paternal grandparents, Alex and Roxanna Bullock, who were deacon and deaconess at the Woodlawn Missionary Baptist Church, which was located on Woodlawn Road off Highway 19. After the war, the sisters reunited with their parents and moved with them to Knoxville. Two years later, the family returned to Nutbush to live in the Flagg Grove community, where Anna attended Flagg Grove Elementary School from first through eighth grade. In 1889, her great-great <b>uncle</b> <b>had</b> sold the land on which the school was built to the school trustees.|$|E

5|$|During the 1992 campaign, it was {{revealed}} that Clinton's <b>uncle</b> <b>had</b> attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then. Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service. Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.|$|E
5|$|In 1525 Dudley married Guildford's {{daughter}} Jane, who {{was four}} years his junior and his former classmate. The Dudleys belonged to the new evangelical circles of the early 1530s, and their 13 children were educated in Renaissance humanism and science. Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 without a written will. His only son having predeceased him, Guildford's nephew, John Guildford, asserted that his <b>uncle</b> <b>had</b> intended him to inherit. Dudley and his wife contested this claim. The parties went to court and Dudley, who had secured Thomas Cromwell's patronage, won the case. In 1532 he lent his cousin, John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley, over ₤7,000 on {{the security of the}} baronial estate. Lord Dudley was unable to pay off any of his creditors, so when the mortgage was foreclosed in the late 1530s Sir John Dudley came into possession of Dudley Castle.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Bogosian entered {{high school}} at Cushing Academy, a prep school in Massachusetts. The {{assistant}} coach of the school's hockey team was Ray Bourque, a former NHL defenseman who {{was elected to the}} Hockey Hall of Fame. Bogosian's teammates at Cushing included his older brother, Aaron, and Bourque's son, Ryan. While at Cushing he was used mostly as a fifth or sixth defenseman and played few minutes as a result. After his second year at the school, Bogosian was selected 19th overall in the 2006 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Draft by the Peterborough Petes Bogosian's decision to play in the OHL rather than go to the NCAA differed from most of his teammates, including his brother. As his father and <b>uncle</b> <b>had</b> also played college football in the NCAA, it was expected that Bogosian would follow them in going to university. He cited watching Ottawa 67's games at age nine as a major influence in deciding to play in Canada.|$|E

5|$|Josefson {{played in}} his first IIHF sanctioned tournament when {{he was part of}} Sweden's team at the 2008 IIHF World U18 Championships. He managed to score a hat-trick in the first game against Belarus. He left the team in the morning before the fourth game due to an {{accident}} in which his father and <b>uncle</b> <b>had</b> been exposed to carbon monoxide poisoning. He made his second appearance at the U18 Championship the following year, at the 2009 IIHF World U18 Championships, where he also took the role as alternate captain. He managed to score three goals and seven points in six games. Josefson was a part of Sweden's national junior team at the 2009 World Junior Championships. He played in all of Sweden's six games but did not score any points. A few months later he yet again played for Sweden in the U18 Championship but could not help his team go further than fifth place in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after birth, he {{was taken}} from his cradle and adopted by his {{maternal}} uncle Kaihupaʻa to be raised in the Hawaiian custom of hānai, an informal form of adoption between extended families practiced by Hawaiian royals and commoners alike. His <b>uncle</b> <b>had</b> been educated by the American Protestant missionary Levi Chamberlain and had served his entire life as a personal assistant and servant to King Kamehameha III and later his successor Kamehameha IV. Iaukea {{was taken to the}} kingdom's capital at Honolulu to live with Kaihupaʻa and his wife Keliaipala. They lived near the grounds of the old ʻIolani Palace, in the building of the former Royal School. Renamed Halepoepoe (meaning circular or round house), this building had been turned into a home for royal retainers and the kahu (caretakers) for the reigning King Kamehameha IV. Around the time he was five or six, Iaukea fell into a well and his uncle Kaihupaʻa broke his foot in the process of saving him, later dying from the injuries he sustained.|$|E
25|$|According to his uncle, Ernest Morphy, no one {{formally}} taught Morphy {{how to play}} chess; rather, Morphy {{learned on}} his own {{as a young child}} simply from watching others play. After silently watching a lengthy game between Ernest and Alonzo, which they abandoned as drawn, young Paul surprised them by stating that Ernest should have won. His father and <b>uncle</b> <b>had</b> not realized that Paul knew the moves, let alone any chess strategy. They were even more surprised when Paul proved his claim by resetting the pieces and demonstrating the win his <b>uncle</b> <b>had</b> missed.|$|E
