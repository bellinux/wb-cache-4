However, contest outcome was not influenced by UV-reduction, and this was despite other obvious asymmetries between opponents, such as body size and residency.

Remote Raman spectroscopy was proposed in the 1960s and initially developed for the measurement of atmospheric gases. The technique was extended In 1992 by Angel et al. for standoff Raman detection of hazardous inorganic and organic compounds. Standoff Raman detection offers a fast-Raman mode of analyzing large areas such as a football field in minutes. A pulsed laser source and gated detector allow Raman spectra measurements in the daylight and reduces the long-lived fluorescent background generated by transition ions and rare earth ions. Another way to avoid fluorescence, first demonstrated by Sandy Asher in 1984, is to use a UV laser probe beam. At wavelengths of 260 nm, there is effectively no fluorescence interference and the <b>UV</b> <b>signal</b> is inherently strong. A 10X beam expander mounted in front of the laser allows focusing of the beam and a telescope is directly coupled through the camera lens for signal collection. With the system's time-gating capability it is possible to measure remote Raman of your distant target and the atmosphere between the laser and target.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing number}} of studies provide {{evidence}} that female plumage coloration is indicative of individual quality and can influence male mate choice. In blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), both sexes exhibit bright ultraviolet (UV) -reflectant crown feathers, which have previously {{been shown to be}} attractive to the opposite sex. In males, there is evidence that UV reflectance of the crown feathers is an honest signal of quality in this species, but it is unclear whether this is the case for females. To address this, the <b>UV</b> <b>signal</b> (an index of relative UV reflectance specific to the visual sensitivities of the blue tit) of mothers was measured during brood rearing for 3 years (2008 – 2010) and related to indices of reproductive success, that is, lay date, clutch size, and number of chicks fledged and maternal state, that is, body condition and baseline corticosterone (CORT). Maternal <b>UV</b> <b>signal</b> was unrelated to clutch size but was positively correlated with number of chicks fledged in 3 years.

40|$|Several {{animal species}} {{have been shown to}} use {{phenotypic}} traits to assess the competitive ability of opponents and adjust their aggressiveness depending on the likelihood to win the contest. In birds, these phenotypic traits usually involve patches of colored feathers. The benefit to harbor honest signals of male quality is the avoidance of wasteful aggressive interactions. Recent work has shown that ultraviolet (UV) plumage reflectance is an important signal used by females during mate choice. Surprisingly, however, the role of <b>UV</b> <b>signaling</b> on intrasexual selection has been neglected. In the present study, we aimed to test whether UV reflectance of crown feathers was used as a signal of male competitive ability during male-male interactions. Breeding male blue tits (Parus caeruleus ultramarinus) were exposed during the female egg-laying period to blue tit taxidermic mounts with either control or reduced UV reflectance of crown feathers.

Most research, however, has focused on the role of <b>UV</b> <b>signals</b> in mate choice, whereas possible functions in intraspecific competition remain largely untested. Studies on other colors indicate that ornaments preferred by females can also function as signals of social status in competitive interactions between individuals. Whereas these colors are mainly pigment based, UV reflectance is generally caused by selective reflectance of light from surface structures. Here we test experimentally whether the structurally based UV-reflective crown plumage in the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) serves as a signal of status in interindividual competition. We reduced the crown UV reflectance of free-living blue tits in winter and compared their probability of winning conflicts over food at a feeding table with control-treated and untreated individuals. Although we controlled for effects of sex, age, and distance from territory, we found no effect of reduced UV reflectance on the probability of winning nor were conflicts involving UV-reduced individuals more likely to escalate. Therefore, we conclude that the UV reflectance of the blue tit’s crown does not serve as a signal of status in competition over food in winter. We suggest that the observed site-dependent dominance structure may constrain the opportunity for a status signal to evolve and that enhancing attractiveness in mate choice may be the sole function of the crown’s UV reflectance. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Functional {{communication}} in the UV range {{has been reported in}} Invertebrates and all major groups of Vertebrates but Amphibians. Although perception in this wavelength range has been shown in a few species, <b>UV</b> <b>signalling</b> has not been demonstrated in this group. One reason may be that in lentic freshwater habitats, litter decomposition generates dissolved organic carbon that absorbs UV radiation and thus hinders its use for visual signalling. We tested the effect of male UV characteristics on female sexual preference in two newt species that experience contrasting levels of UV water transmission when breeding. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analysed water spectral characteristics of a sample of breeding ponds in both species. We quantified male ventral coloration and measured male attractiveness under two lighting conditions (UV present, UV absent) using a no-choice female preference design. UV transmission was higher in Lissotriton vulgaris breeding sites. Male UV patterns also differed between experimental males of the two species. We observed a first common peak around 333 nm, higher in L. vulgaris, and a second peak around 397 nm, more frequent and higher in L. helveticus. Male attractiveness was significantly reduced in L. vulgaris when UV was not available but not in L. helveticus. Male attractiveness depended on the hue of the first UV peak in L. vulgaris. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study is the first report of functional UV-based {{communication in}} Amphibians. Interestingly, male spectral characteristics and female preferences were consistent with the differences in habitat observed between the two species as L. helveticus often breeds in ponds containing more UV blocking compounds.

Importantly, the manipulated levels of UV brightness in these experiments fall well within the naturally occurring bounds of variation in male UV reflectance.

In apparent contrast, comparison of 161 in-copula and 188 free-flying males from a high-density field assemblage revealed that copulating males were significantly older and henceforth actually possessed (subtly) less UV bright wings. Copulating male UV brightness was, however, positively related to the size of their mate, which echoes the experimental findings and may represent a signature of mutual mate choice.

40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{ultraviolet}} (<b>UV)</b> <b>signals</b> {{for communication}} tasks is widespread in vertebrates. For instance, {{there is a}} UV component to mate choice in several species. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how the signal value of the UV wave band compares {{to that of other}} regions of the animal's visible spectrum. We investigated the relative importance of <b>UV</b> <b>signals</b> compared with signals of longer wavelengths in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a species using UV wavelengths in female and male mate choice as well as in shoaling behavior. In a choice experiment, female sticklebacks were simultaneously presented with four male visual appearances manipulated by optical filters. Each male lacked one wavelength range of the stickleback's visible spectrum corresponding to the spectral sensitivities of the four cone types. The resulting male appearances thus had no UV (UV-), no short-wave (SW-), no medium-wave (MW-) or no long-wave (LW-) body reflectance. Results Males without UV wavelengths and long wavelengths ("red") were least preferred. In contrast, the removal of medium and most notably short wavelengths left male attractiveness to females rather unaffected. Using color metrics, the effects of the four optical filters on stickleback perception of three male body regions were illustrated as quantal catches calculated for the four single cones. Conclusion The removal of UV light (UV-) considerably reduced visual attractiveness of courting males to female three-spined sticklebacks particularly in comparison to the removal of short-wave light (SW-). We thus report first experimental evidence that the UV wave band clearly outranks at least one other part of an animal's visible spectrum (SW-) in the context of communication. In addition, females were also less attracted to males presented without long wavelengths (LW-) which supports the traditionally considered strong influence of the red color component on stickleback mate choice. Overall, the removal of medium wavelengths (MW-) and especially short (SW-) left male attractiveness for females rather unaffected. Our work suggests that, in addition to long wavelengths ("red"), the UV wave band contains important information for visual mate choice in sticklebacks. Hence, the previously suggested exclusive role of the characteristic red nuptial coloration in visual interactions between reproductively active stickleback conspecifics may be overestimated with UV wavelengths playing a more important role than previously suggested. </p...|$|R
