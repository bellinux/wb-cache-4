In this paper we present a patch for Wireshark version 0. 99. 7 that can automatically decode and further process VTun encapsulated packets to allow deeper inspection into the IP packets being carried within the tunnel.

40|$|For many years, {{people have}} been trying to develop systems from modular, {{reusable}} components. The ideal goal is zero-code composition: building an application out of existing components without having to write code. Today's component frameworks are built under the assumption that the same methods used to construct components should also be used to compose them; but these methods actually impede compositional reuse. We identify two main classes of these impediments: those having to do with control ow within a composition, and those having to do with how components interface with each other. We propose solutions for removing these impediments. We also introduce preliminary results showing how some software engineering techniques <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>large</b> systems are made more compelling within this zero-code composition framework...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the fusion of photons from two {{independent}} photonic crystal fiber sources into polarization entangled states using a fiber-based polarizing beamsplitter. We achieve fidelities of up to F = 0. 74 ± 0. 01 {{with respect to the}} maximally entangled Bell state (φ +) using a low pump power of 5. 3 mW with a success rate of 3. 2 fourfold detections per second. By increasing the pump power we find that success rates of up to 111. 6 fourfold detections per second can be achieved, with entanglement still present in the fused state. We characterize the fusion operation by providing a full quantum process reconstruction. Here a model is developed to describe the generation of entanglement, including the main causes of imperfection, and we show that this model fits well with the experimental results. Our work shows how non-ideal settings limit the success of the fusion, providing useful information about the practical requirements for an operation that may be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>large</b> entangled states in bulk and on-chip quantum photonic waveguides...|$|E
40|$|We propose using latent class {{analysis}} {{as an alternative}} to log-linear analysis for the multiple imputation of incomplete cate-gorical data. Similar to log-linear models, latent class models can be used to describe complex association structures between the variables used in the imputation model. However, unlike log-linear models, latent class models can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>large</b> im-putation models containing more than a few categorical variables. To obtain imputations reflecting uncertainty about the unknown model parameters, we use a nonparametric bootstrap procedure {{as an alternative to}} the more common full Bayesian approach.
