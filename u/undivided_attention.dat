25|$|Roddick {{considered}} quitting competitive tennis {{at the age}} of 17, when he had {{a losing}} streak in the juniors. His coach, Tarik Benhabiles, talked him into giving tennis four more months of <b>undivided</b> <b>attention.</b> Roddick finished as the No. 6 junior in the U.S. in 1999, and as the No. 1 junior in the world in 2000. He won six world junior singles titles and seven world junior doubles titles, and won the US Open and Australian Open junior singles titles in 2000.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 24 April, Farragut's fleet made its {{historic}} run past the Mississippi River forts that defended New Orleans from the south. Because the Rebel leaders had not coordinated {{the responsibilities of the}} forts and the associated river fleet, the action was divided into two independent parts. Each ship of the attacking column was past the forts before she had to contend with the defending Confederate vessels, which therefore received the <b>undivided</b> <b>attention</b> of the Yankee gunners when they met. Under the circumstances, only one of the River Defense Fleet managed to close with the enemy: Stonewall Jackson was able to ram USS Varuna while that unfortunate gunboat was simultaneously being rammed by Governor Moore of the Louisiana navy. Varuna sank, the only Federal ship lost that night. Stonewall Jackson did not escape unscathed. Holed by shots from other Federal ships assisting Varuna and unable to reply, she was run ashore by her crew, where they abandoned her and set her afire.|$|E
25|$|The Zulu trouble, and disaffection brewing in the Transvaal, reacted {{upon each}} other most disastrously. The delay in giving {{the country a}} {{constitution}} afforded a pretext for agitation to the resentful Boers, a rapidly increasing minority, while the defeat at Isandlwana had badly tarnished {{the reputation of the}} British Empire in the region. Owing to the Xhosa and Zulu wars, Sir Bartle had been unable to give his <b>undivided</b> <b>attention</b> to the state of things in the Transvaal until April 1879, when he was at last able to visit a camp of about 4,000 disaffected Boers near Pretoria. Though conditions were grim, Frere managed to win the Boers' respect by promising to present their complaints to the British government, and to urge the fulfilment of the promises that had been made to them. The Boers did eventually disperse, on the very day upon which Frere received the telegram announcing the government's censure. On his return to Cape Town, he found that his achievement had been eclipsed—first by 1 June 1879 death of Napoleon Eugene, Prince Imperial in Zululand, and then by the news that the government of the Transvaal and Natal, together with the high commissionership {{in the eastern part of}} South Africa, had been transferred from him to Sir Garnet Wolseley. Meanwhile, growing Boer resentment at Frere's policies erupted in December 1880 into the disastrous First Boer War. The First Boer War, with the humiliating British defeats at Bronkhorstspruit, Laing's Nek, Schuinshoogte and Majuba Hill led to the independence of the Boer Republics and the final end of Carnarvon's confederation scheme.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{temporary}} <b>undivided</b> supportive <b>attention</b> {{from another}} person often {{gives rise to}} strong feelings, apparently towards that person, typically of [...] "falling in love" [...] with them. This {{is similar to the}} phenomenon of transference, particularly when one of the partners is felt to have more authority because, for instance, they are more experienced, are teachers of co-counselling, or have authority roles within the organisation. The organisations differ in the ways that they handle this. [...] The inability to trust and feel in real relationships is often exacerbated by the pseudo-intimacy of co-counseling, making transference more likely and more dangerous.|$|R
40|$|A {{dependency}} {{scale has}} been devised {{for the assessment}} of the needs of neonates for nursing time. It has been validated by work studies which have shown that non-surgical babies can be grouped into one of two categories: high dependency babies generating a mean (SD) 25 (5) minutes and low dependency babies generating 12 (3) minutes of nursing work per hour, when the work is averaged out over the whole shift. Any one of five simple and unambiguous criteria serve as robust markers for identifying more than 95 % of babies regularly generating more than 15 minutes of nursing work per hour. The scale is simpler, can be applied more rapidly, and with greater consistency, than other currently available neonatal dependency scales. Additional allowance needs to be made for miscellaneous activity not attributable to individual babies, for the occasional baby who requires almost continuous <b>undivided</b> nursing <b>attention,</b> for the possibility of new admissions, and for the provision of an emergency interhospital transport service. A formula is suggested by which safe staffing levels for any given nursing shift can be determined, based upon the number of babies present and their dependency levels as determined by the scale...|$|R

Collar regards it their best album.

500|$|The book {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} responses from critics. R Krishna from Daily News and Analysis gave a positive review for the book. He {{observed that the}} criticism in the second book regarding bad editing and writing has been polished in The Oath of the Vayuputras. He complimented the fact that philosophical discussions {{in the book is}} rightly balanced by action sequences, commending the way in which Sati's fight with the assassins is described. Krishna concluded that the different characters of the book make it a good reading and a fitting ending to the series. Phorum Dalal from Mid Day praised the urban dialect used by Shiva in the book and felt that Tripathi's grip on the whole story is steady and has the reader's <b>undivided</b> <b>attention,</b> ultimately [...] "giving the Trilogy an end it deserves". Sanjeev Sanyal from Business Standard gave a neutral review saying that although the fast-paced and easy style from the earlier books has been retained, it is evident if one goes back and rereads the first few pages of The Immortals of Meluha that Tripathi has become much more comfortable and confident of his writing. [...] "Of course, those whose literary tastes have not outgrown Wren and Martin will still find fault with his use of the English language. For the rest of us, it is delightful to see how Tripathi applies simple language to evoke great battle scenes and extraordinary landscapes".|$|E

5000|$|In April 1958 Darling {{replaced}} Pete Seeger in The Weavers, {{although he}} continued working club dates with The Tarriers until November 1959. Darling also recorded three solo albums. His second solo effort, True Religion for Vanguard in 1961 was influential on younger folkies of the day. In 1956, he accompanied the Kossoy Sisters on their album, Bowling Green. Additional instrumental work is featured on Banjo Music of the Southern Appalachians (Olympic Records, undated, with Darling's first name misspelled as [...] "Eric" [...] {{on the album}} cover). Darling left the Weavers in June 1962 {{to work as a}} soloist on the emerging coffeehouse circuit. That summer he formed a jazz-folk trio, The Rooftop Singers, with longtime friend Bill Svanoe and jazz singer Lynn Taylor. Intended as a studio-only project for Vanguard, the group landed an unexpected number one pop hit with a cover of Gus Cannon's 1929 song [...] "Walk Right In". Don McLean, who became friends with Darling in 1961, looked back on Darling as “a genuine philosopher and perfectionist.” He said, “I appreciated the time he spent with me so long ago. <b>Undivided</b> mental <b>attention</b> to every aspect of music making and performing is a hallmark of Erik’s work, and I believe some of that rubbed off on me.” ...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{traditional}} {{leaders in the}} Republic of South Africa (RSA) has remained a controversial issue {{over the past few}} years. The growing political tension needed the government's immediate <b>undivided</b> and unbiased <b>attention.</b> The continuing dialectical clash between forces of modernity for development and the persistent strength {{of traditional}} leadership is still an issue in the country. Traditional relationship and social structures are crumbling, while the new relationship remains to be formed. Traditional authority constitutes a form of local government in terms of indigenous law. This authority was mandated previously to legislate on certain functional activities of local government that is in charge of development. The period of industrialization and the influence of capitalism, which have long been a fate of most western countries, have today {{turned out to be a}} contemporary fate for the new democratic South Africa.

The matter passed from my mind, full of churches and [...] church matters, in which I was now {{gradually}} acquiring knowledge. [...] In 1841 the necessities of the whig government led to a further [...] development of the great controversy; but I interfered only in the [...] colonial part of it in connection with the colonies and the slave [...] trade to Porto Rico and Brazil.

6000|$|And {{now here}} she was, {{in a house}} all by herself, coming down to her meals, one after another, without the {{excitement}} of a cheerful face opposite to her, and with all possibility of confidential intercourse with her brother entirely cut off. Lillie, in this matter, acted, with much grace and spirit, {{the part of the}} dog in the manger; and, while she resolutely refused to enter into any of John's literary or intellectual tastes, seemed to consider her wifely rights infringed upon by any other woman who would. She would absolutely refuse to go up with her husband and spend an evening with Grace, alleging it was [...] "pokey and stupid," [...] and that they always got talking about things that she didn't care any thing about. If, then, John went without her to spend the evening, he was sure to be received, on his return, with a dead and gloomy silence, more fearful, sometimes, than the most violent of objurgations. That look of patient, heart-broken woe, those long-drawn sighs, were a reception that he dreaded, to say the truth, a great deal more than a direct attack, or any fault-finding to which he could have replied; and so, on the whole, John made up his mind that the best thing he could do was to stay at home and rock the cradle of this fretful baby, whose wisdom-teeth were so hard to cut, and so long in coming. It was a pretty baby; and when made the sole and <b>undivided</b> object of <b>attention,</b> when every thing possible was done for it by everybody in the house, condescended often to be very graceful and winning and playful, and had numberless charming little ways and tricks. The difference between Lillie in good humor and Lillie in bad humor was a thing which John soon learned to appreciate {{as one of the most}} powerful forces in his life. If you knew, my dear reader, that by pursuing a certain course you could bring upon yourself a drizzling, dreary, north-east rain-storm, and by taking heed to your ways you could secure sunshine, flowers, and bird-singing, you would be very careful, after a while, to keep about you the right atmospheric temperature; and, if going to see the very best friend you had on earth was sure to bring on a fit of rheumatism or tooth-ache, you would soon learn to be very sparing of your visits. For this reason it was that Grace saw very little of John; that she never now had a sisterly conversation with him; that she preferred arranging all those little business matters, in which it would be convenient to have a masculine appeal, solely and singly by herself. The thing was never referred to in any conversation between them. It was perfectly understood without words. There are friends between whom and us has shut the coffin-lid; and there are others between whom and us stand sacred duties, considerations never to be enough reverenced, which forbid us to seek their society, or to ask to lean on them either in joy or sorrow: the whole thing as regards them must be postponed until the future life. Such had been Grace's conclusion with regard to her brother. She well knew that any attempt to restore their former intimacy would only diminish and destroy what little chance of happiness yet remained to him; and it may therefore be imagined with what changed eyes she read Walter Sydenham's letter from those of years ago.|$|R
