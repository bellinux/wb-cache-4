40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} the ICF for initial comprehensive evaluation of early post-acute spinal cord injury. Method A comprehensive evaluation of 62 early post-acute spinal cord injury (SCI) patients was conducted by rehabilitation team members, such as physicians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, nutritionists, medical social-workers, and nurses. They recorded each of their evaluation according to the ICF first level classification. The contents of the comprehensive evaluation were linked to the ICF second level categories, retrospectively. The linked codes were analyzed descriptively and were also compared with the brief ICF core set for early post-acute SCI. Results In the evaluation of early post-acute SCI patients based on the ICF first level categories, 19 items from the body functions domain, such as muscle power functions (b 730) and <b>urination</b> <b>functions</b> (b 620), 15 items from the body structures domain, including spinal cord and related structures (s 120), 11 items from the activities and participation domain, such as transferring oneself (d 420) and walking (d 450), and 9 items from the environmental factors domain, e. g., health professionals (e 355), were linked to the ICF second level categories. In total, 82. 4 % of all contents were linked to the brief ICF core set. Prognosis insight, a personal factor not linkable to an ICF code, was mentioned in 29. 0 % of all patients. Conclusion First level ICF categories can provide a structural base for a comprehensive evaluation in early post-acute spinal cord injury. However, frequently linked items, including the brief core set, as well as personal factors should be considered via a checklist {{in order to prevent}} the omission of significant contents...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and safety of stem cell transplantation for spinal cord injury (SCI). DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal, Wanfang, and SinoMed databases were systematically searched by computer to select clinical randomized controlled trials using stem cell transplantation to treat SCI, published between each database initiation and July 2016. DATA SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials comparing stem cell transplantation with rehabilitation treatment for patients with SCI. Inclusion criteria: (1) Patients with SCI diagnosed according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) International standards for neurological classification of SCI; (2) patients with SCI who received only stem cell transplantation therapy or stem cell transplantation combined with rehabilitation therapy; (3) one or more of the following outcomes reported: outcomes concerning neurological function including sensory function and locomotor function, activities of daily living, <b>urination</b> <b>functions,</b> and severity of SCI or adverse effects. Studies comprising patients with complications, without full-text, and preclinical animal models were excluded. Quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool and RevMan V 5. 3 software, provided by the Cochrane Collaboration, was used to perform statistical analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: ASIA motor score, ASIA light touch score, ASIA pinprick score, ASIA impairment scale grading improvement rate, activities of daily living score, residual urine volume, and adverse events. RESULTS: Ten studies comprising 377 patients were included in the analysis and the overall risk of bias was relatively low level. Four studies did not detail how random sequences were generated, two studies did not clearly state the blinding outcome assessment, two studies lacked blinding outcome assessment, one study lacked follow-up information, and four studies carried out selective reporting. Compared with rehabilitation therapy, stem cell transplantation significantly increased the lower limb light touch score (odds ratio (OR) = 3. 43, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 01 – 6. 86, P = 0. 05), lower limb pinprick score (OR = 3. 93, 95 %CI: 0. 74 – 7. 12, P = 0. 02), ASI grading rate (relative risk (RR) = 2. 95, 95 %CI: 1. 64 – 5. 29, P = 0. 0003), and notably reduced residual urine volume (OR = – 8. 10, 95 %CI: – 15. 09 to – 1. 10, P = 0. 02). However, stem cell transplantation did not significantly improve motor score (OR = 1. 89, 95 %CI: – 0. 25 to 4. 03, P = 0. 08) or activities of daily living score (OR = 1. 12, 95 %CI: – 1. 17 to 4. 04, P = 0. 45). Furthermore, stem cell transplantation caused a high rate of mild adverse effects (RR = 14. 49, 95 %CI: 5. 34 – 34. 08, P < 0. 00001); however, these were alleviated in a short time. CONCLUSION: Stem cell transplantation was determined to be an efficient and safe treatment for SCI and simultaneously improved sensory and bladder functions. Although associated minor and temporary adverse effects were observed with transplanted stem cells, spinal cord repair and axon remyelination were apparent. More randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up times are needed to further validate the effectiveness of stem cell transplantation in the treatment of SCI...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Spinal cord lesion due {{to injury}} or disease (SCD) has a severe {{impact on the}} level of {{function}}ing, results in body function impairments, causes restrictions in everyday life, and stress. This stress experience can have an additional negative impact on well-being and health of persons with SCD. Stress reduction is therefore an important aim in order to achieve and maintain health in SCD. Strengthening internal resources of a person can support this endeavor. Objective: To describe the role of internal resources for stress reduction as rehabilitation target in the context of interdisciplinary clinical rehabilitation of SCD using ICF-based rehabilitation management tools. Methods: Single Case Study. Results: Strengthening internal resources contributed to stress reduction in the rehabilitation of a person with SCD. Active involvement in decision taking increased the patient's perceived self-determination and reduced stress. Impairments in <b>urination</b> <b>function</b> remained a major stressor and negatively affected the patient's self-esteem. ICF-based documentation tools highlighted the role of internal resources, stress and functioning in rehabilitation management. Conclusion: Internal resources should be strengthened when aiming at stress reduction in a patient with SCD. ICF-based documentation tools support this undertaking...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundTo {{evaluate}} the surgical technique and functional {{outcome of a}} new application of the chimney modification to the popular Hautmann ileal neobladder. This modification used 3 - 5 cm chimney tubularized ileal segment for the bilateral ureterointestinal anastomosis. MethodsBetween December 2000 and July 2004, 15 patients (14 men, 1 woman) with invasive bladder cancer underwent radical cystectomy and Hautmann neobladder with chimney modification at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok. Mean age was 61. 7 years (range, 43 - 72 years). Perioperative morbidity, early and late urinary diversion-related complications, other surgical complications, follow-up results of ureterointestinal anastomosis, renal function and metabolic disorders were evaluated. Patients were interviewed about their continence, voiding function and potency. ResultsAt a mean follow-up of 29. 5 months, two patients had died of cancer progression. Of the 15 patients, nine (60 %) had 10 early complications. Eight complications {{were related to the}} neobladder and two were not. Three (20 %) patients had three late complications. Two complications were neobladder-related and one was not. There was no perioperative mortality. There was no ureteroileal anastomosis stricture in this series. Neobladder-ureteral reflux was demonstrated in eight of 22 ureteral units in 11 patients in whom cystography was performed. All patients had normal upper urinary tract without evidence of urinary obstruction. All 14 men (93 % of study sample) had spontaneous <b>urination,</b> normal renal <b>function</b> and no metabolic acidosis. Good and satisfactory continence in the day and night were 93 % and 73 %, respectively. All male patients experienced impotence postoperatively. Only one sought treatment and was successfully treated with sildenafil. The one woman in this study required intermittent catheterization to empty the neobladder completely. She also had renal insufficiency with serum creatinine of 2. 2 mg/dL and hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis. ConclusionNew chimney modification in Hautmann ileal neobladder is simple and safe. Complications are acceptable. Follow-up results of renal and voiding functions are satisfactory. This operation can maintain good quality of life for patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy...|$|R
40|$|Hypospadias is a {{congenital}} malformation {{that occurs in}} 0. 3 - 1 % of live births, in which the meatus (the urethral opening) is dorsally malpositioned. Uncorrected hypospadias can cause difficulties in <b>urination,</b> abnormal sexual <b>function,</b> and adverse psychological consequences; surgical correction, though generally successful, constitutes an economic burden for families. Several common classes of pesticides have demonstrated potential to disrupt normal endocrine hormones that regulate fetal genitourinary development. Past epidemiologic studies of pesticide exposure and risk of hypospadias have been limited by limited available data, small sample sizes, or poor ascertainment of pesticide exposure. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the relationship between parental occupational pesticide exposure and risk of hypospadias in their offspring; and further, to assess whether addition of residential pesticide exposure data is feasible and contributes to overall pesticide exposure. We began by conducting a meta-analysis of the current literature, in which summary measures of occupation (such as census occupation code) had been used to assign pesticide exposure. We found elevated but marginally significant risks of hypospadias were associated with maternal occupational exposure (PRR of 1. 36, CI = 1. 04 - 1. 77), and paternal occupational exposure (PRR of 1. 19, CI= 1. 00 - 1. 41) in the previously published literature. We then used industrial hygienist review of occupational histories to estimate the relationship between pesticide exposure and risk of hypospadias. We found that maternal occupational exposure to any pesticides (yes/no) was not associated with an increased risk of hypospadias (OR = 0. 83, 95 % CI = 0. 6 - 1. 1), cumulative insecticide (OR = 1. 09; 95 % CI = 0. 9 - 1. 3), herbicide (OR = 1. 05; 95 % CI = 0. 9 - 1. 2), or fungicide (OR = 0. 91; 95 % CI = 0. 7 - 1. 2) exposure. These negative findings might be explained by a lack of relationship at the low levels of exposure observed in this study population, in which case another farm exposure could be related to hypospadias; or this negative finding may be due to exposure misclassification. Finally, we evaluated the feasibility and relevance of collecting residential pesticide exposure and direct reports of occupational exposure from fathers. Residential pesticide use during the six months prior to pregnancy and during pregnancy was common among control mothers: 45 % reported that their home had been treated for insect or rodent pests; 47 % reported that their lawn or garden had been treated for weeds or insect pests; 16 % used a lawn service; 26 % reported that a pet had been treated for fleas, ticks, or mites (including flea and tick preventives); 17 % reported community-wide sprayings for pests; and 16 % reported that their workplaces were treated for pests. Case mothers were more likely to report that their home had been treated of insect or rodent pests (50 %) or that a pet had been treated for fleas, ticks, or mites (36. 5 %). Our results suggest that collection of information on residential pesticide use is feasible, and the impact of residential pesticide use on birth defects risk should be assessed in future studies...|$|R
