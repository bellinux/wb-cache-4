5000|$|Hind {{approached}} {{the editor of}} the Manitoba Free Press, W.F. Luxton, about a job, using a letter of introduction from her uncle, George, who was a friend of Luxton's. Luxton turned her down indicating that a newsroom was no place for a woman with no journalism experience. A few months later Hind submitted an article to Luxton. He accepted the letter, but chose not to acknowledge her as an author. This situation forced her into becoming a typist. “She worked there until 1893, when she opened her own business as a stenographer [...]” Ella became the first public typewriter in Manitoba. Now that Ella Cora Hinds was doing well for herself, she and her Aunt Alice joined The Women’s Christian Temperance Union. Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) is the oldest continuing non-sectarian women's organization worldwide. Founded in Evanston, Illinois in 1873, the group spearheaded the crusade for prohibition. Cora also linked up with Dr. Amelia Yeomans, because she wanted women to have rights to vote. They both formed Manitoba Equal Suffrage Club. Their motto was “Peace on earth, good will towards men." [...] Cora Hind and Dr. Yeomans worked hard {{to improve the lives of}} women and the poor, Cora than became a member of The Winnipeg Chapter of Canadian Women's Press Club. [...] Along with all of the duties that Ella had dedicated herself she still had a strong interest in farming. Living in Winnipeg and knowing about the grain trade center of the west, Cora finally became a regular reporter and the commercial and agricultural editor of the Manitoba Free Press. J. W. Dafoe was {{the editor of the}} paper helped Cora become a famous for her accurate analysis of crop yields, and other livestock. Between 1935 and 1937, Hind travelled to 27 wheat producing countries capturing her experiences, including comments on social conditions and historical associations, in a series of letters to the Winnipeg Free Press. A selection of these letters were released by popular demand in her 1937 book Seeing for myself. The book was so successful that a second book, My travels and findings (1939), was two years later featuring selections from her personal papers. [...] Cora Hind then formed the Political Equality League with Lillian Beynon Thomas and Nellie McClung in 1912. Their campaign for women’s voting rights later were granted in 1916. After all her successful movements in life she received many honors from The Western Canada Livestock <b>Union,</b> <b>Wool</b> Grower's of Manitoba, and Canadian Society of Technical Agriculturists. The University of Manitoba also presented her with an honorary LLD degree in 1935.|$|E

5000|$|In 1878, a German {{professor}} named Gustav Jaeger {{published a}} book claiming that only clothing made of animal hair, such as wool, promoted health. A British accountant named Lewis Tomalin translated the book, then opened a shop selling Dr Jaeger’s Sanitary Woollen System, including knitted <b>wool</b> <b>union</b> suits. These were soon called [...] "Jaegers"; they were widely popular.|$|R
50|$|The {{growth of}} Geelong as {{the centre of}} the wool {{industry}} wasn’t without its detractors. Melbourne considered itself the centre of exports and sales. Charles Dennys, when opening his wool sales in Geelong, fuelled the competitiveness by stating that by making Geelong the centre would save costs for local agriculturalists as they wouldn’t need to cover the costs of shipping to Melbourne. This was counteracted with a propaganda campaign that included a false map that made it appear that Geelong was further away from the main Victorian towns than Melbourne so investors unfamiliar with the area would instead invest in Melbourne! It wasn’t successful and the wool industry became the cornerstone in the growth of Geelong. By the 1890s, wool made up ⅔ of Australia’s exports. This also meant the industry provided a huge number of employment opportunities, many of which centered around Woolstores. Victoria was the centre of a lively Union movement as workers fought hard for better conditions and wages! They were encouraged and influenced by similar movements in the UK. The Woolstores certainly weren’t immune to this as even their own workers weren’t striking other parts of the industry were. Throughout the late 1800s the wharf workers were often on strike meaning the wool couldn’t be moved out and often the warehouse workers would be out supporting the strikers. There were also strikes from Sheep Shearers Union or transport <b>unions</b> so no <b>wool</b> would be coming into the Woolstores! The unions were attempting to make working conditions better and ensure that pay and work hours were reasonable. Geelong participated in the 8 hour day celebrations after skilled workers unions managed to negotiate 8 hour work days for those on Government sites. This success influenced the other unions to continue their push for better conditions. In the Geelong Woolstores the main <b>unions</b> were <b>Wool</b> and Basil Workers Federation; Amalgamated Fellmongers Woolsorters & Woolscourers <b>Union</b> of Australia; <b>Wool</b> & Basil Workers Federation of Australia; (Federated) Storemen and Packers Union; Wool and Skin Stores Employees Union.|$|R
25|$|The American Civil War {{shut down}} {{many of the}} mills {{temporarily}} when they sold off their cotton stockpiles, which had become more valuable than the finished cloth after imports from the South had stopped. Many jobs were lost, but the effect was somewhat mitigated {{by the number of}} men serving in the military. Lowell had a small historical place in the war: Many <b>wool</b> <b>Union</b> uniforms were made in Lowell, General Benjamin Franklin Butler was from the city, and members of the Lowell-based Massachusetts Sixth—Ladd, Whitney, Taylor, and Needham—were the first four Union deaths, killed in a riot while passing through Baltimore on their way to Washington, DC. Ladd, Whitney, and later Taylor are buried in front of City Hall under a large obelisk.|$|R
50|$|The {{transformation}} from a work-based credit union {{to a more}} community-based one prompted another name change, to S.W.B. Community Credit Union Ltd. In 1983 the Rediteller ATM network was launched and all members were issued with Redicards, for use in some 500 ATMs nationwide. In 1984, the Credit Union Visa Card gave members debit-card access to their funds almost anywhere in the world. At {{this time there was}} also a merger with AMOCO Employees Credit Union. Membership grew to 21,941, with deposits of $28,585,671 and total assets of $31,756,576. In 1986 the Credit <b>Union</b> merged with <b>Wool</b> Broker and Trustees Staff Credit Union. In 1989 the credit union had 31,355 members with total assets of $75,615,583. It granted loans worth $35,530,000 in that year. The Bathurst Street building was sold and head office was relocated to Auburn. In 1990 there was another local merger this time with Muniff Credit Union.|$|R
5000|$|Victorian dress {{reform was}} an {{objective}} of the Victorian dress reform movement (also known as the rational dress movement) of the middle and late Victorian era, comprising various reformers who proposed, designed, and wore clothing considered more practical and comfortable than the fashions of the time.Dress reformists were largely middle class women involved in {{the first wave of}} feminism in the United States and in Britain, from the 1850s through the 1890s. The movement emerged in the Progressive Era along with calls for temperance, women's education, suffrage and moral purity. Dress reform called for emancipation from the [...] "dictates of fashion", expressed a desire to “cover the limbs as well as the torso adequately,” and promoted [...] "rational dress". The movement had its greatest success in the reform of women's undergarments, which could be modified without exposing the wearer to social ridicule. Dress reformers were also influential in persuading women to adopt simplified garments for athletic activities such as bicycling or swimming. The movement was much less concerned with men's clothing, although it initiated the widespread adoption of knitted <b>wool</b> <b>union</b> suits or long johns.|$|R
