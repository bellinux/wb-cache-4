40|$|AbstractA hybrid {{stereolithography}} (SL) /direct print (DP) {{system has}} been developed and previously described that fabricates three-dimensional (3 D) structural electronic devices in which component placement, interconnect routing, and system boundaries are not confined to two dimensions {{as is the case}} with traditional printed circuit boards (PCBs). The resulting increased level of design and fabrication freedom provides potential for a reduction in both volume and weight as well as the capability of fabricating systems in arbitrary and complex shapes as required to conform to unique application requirements (e. g., human anatomy, airframe structures, and other volumetrically-constrained mechanical systems). The fabrication of these devices without intermediate part removal between SL and DP processes requires in situ curing of DP-dispensed silver-based <b>inks</b> to sufficiently <b>cure</b> the <b>inks</b> prior to continuing additional SL fabrication. This paper describes investigations into the laser curing process using the two laser wavelengths, 355 nm and 325 nm, which have been used in commercial SL machines. Various laser curing parameters, including energy (laser power and scan speed), scanning location, and laser wavelength were investigated. The trace resistances and structural changes in the SL substrate and printed trace were compared for each experiment to determine the most preferred laser <b>ink</b> <b>curing</b> method. Furthermore, oven curing of partially laser <b>cured</b> <b>ink</b> traces was investigated as a means for minimizing the number of in situ laser passes required to embed ink traces during SL fabrication. The laser curing process was repeated for a wide variety of conductive inks, having different structure, composition, and curing properties to determine if certain inks were more responsive to laser curing and if the <b>ink</b> <b>curing</b> results could be generalized. A statistical study was conducted under the hypothesis that laser <b>curing</b> of <b>inks</b> at 325 nm wavelength would be better, due to lower silver reflectance, as compared to 355 nm wavelength. Results indicated that particulate silver based conductive inks can be successfully cured in situ using SL lasers with various laser <b>curing</b> parameters. <b>Curing</b> <b>ink</b> traces at high laser power and slow scan speeds with the laser beam located on the substrate adjacent to the ink channel resulted in the most effective <b>ink</b> <b>curing</b> but resulted in discoloration of the ink and/or charring of the SL substrate. Comparatively, when laser power was reduced sufficiently to eliminate the charring, lower effective <b>ink</b> <b>curing</b> was achieved. Irradiating the laser directly on the ink did not damage the ink or the substrate, while providing low trace resistances, and represents the most viable laser curing alternative to achieve acceptable trace resistance without charring the SL substrate. The results further indicated that partial laser <b>curing</b> of <b>ink</b> using a reduced number of laser passes with subsequent oven cure seem to work effectively and may decrease overall manufacturing time. SL lasers with low power (< 100 mW) may not be effective for <b>curing</b> conductive <b>inks</b> that have high viscosities and require high curing temperatures. Finally, a statistical study determined that 325 nm is more effective for direct <b>curing</b> of the <b>ink</b> as compared to the 355 nm laser...|$|R

The presence of {{low molecular weight}} LC molecules in the polymer matrix modifies dramatically the dynamic and static mechanical behavior of the obtained composite materials. Above the glass transition temperature Tg (LC), dilution of the initial mixture with a low molecular weight LC like E 7 leads to a significant weakening of the film mechanical strength. At temperatures below Tg (LC) a strong temperature dependence on the storage tensile modulus was found for EB-cured networks, including 30 – 50 wt. -% LC, the LC reinforces the polymer by an increase of the storage tensile modulus.

5000|$|UV-curable inks: These inks consist {{mainly of}} acrylic {{monomers}} with an initiator package. After printing, the <b>ink</b> is <b>cured</b> {{by exposure to}} strong UV-light. Ink is exposed to UV radiation where a chemical reaction takes place where the photo-initiators cause the ink components to cross-link into a solid. Typically a shuttered mercury-vapor lamp or UV LED {{is used for the}} curing process. Curing processes with high power for short periods of times (microseconds) allow <b>curing</b> <b>inks</b> on thermally sensitive substrates. UV inks do not evaporate, but rather cure or set as a result from this chemical reaction. No material is evaporated or removed, which means about 100% of the delivered volume is used to provide coloration. This reaction happens very quickly, which leads to instant drying that results in a completely cured graphic in a matter of seconds. This also allows for a very fast print process. As a result of this instant chemical reaction no solvents penetrate the substrate once it comes off the printer, which allows for high quality prints. The advantage of UV-curable inks is that they [...] "dry" [...] as soon as they are cured, they can be applied {{to a wide range of}} uncoated substrates, and they produce a very robust image. Disadvantages are that they are expensive, require expensive curing modules in the printer, and the <b>cured</b> <b>ink</b> has a significant volume and so gives a slight relief on the surface. Though improvements are being made in the technology, UV-curable inks, because of their volume, are somewhat susceptible to cracking if applied to a flexible substrate. As such, they are often used in large [...] "flatbed" [...] printers, which print directly to rigid substrates such as plastic, wood or aluminium where flexibility is not a concern.|$|R

This allows a complete understanding of the effect of chemical heterogeneity on droplet shape, and therefore on printing quality.

This has stimulated the rapid {{development of}} flexible circuitry manufacturing technologies, including advances in conductive inks, printing technology and most importantly the novel curing technology - laser based curing (or Laser Direct Write). This {{has the ability to}} replace the conventional environmentally damaging and time consuming chemical etching method in current Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing. The work presented in this thesis is an investigation into a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser curing process of epoxy-based micro-sized particulate silver inks. This 532 nm laser curing process filled the gap as no research reported for solidifying conductive microparticle silver ink using this particular laser wavelength at 532 nm. This 532 nm laser curing process also extended the curing technology with a fast localized heating process. The composition of the epoxy-based conductive silver ink was studied in this investigation. The laser wavelength of 532 nm was selected as the silver microparticles can absorb the laser energy more efficiently without the risk of damaging the material compared to infrared wavelength. Liquid-phase epoxy-based particulate silver inks deposited on flexible substrates were irradiated by laser beam at the wavelength of 532 nm. This produced a smooth and <b>cured</b> <b>ink</b> with an effectively reduced electrical resistivity. A new laser curing mechanism theory was proposed based on the presented experimental research. 532 nm has shown benefits in protecting the flexible substrate used from thermal damage, owing to the high transmittance of the wavelength through the substrate material. Unlike massive solvent evaporation observed in CO 2 laser curing at 10. 6 µm, laser curing at 532 nm, transported the solvent component by expelling solvent liquid from the ink system {{as a result of a}} radical change in solvent dynamic viscosity at an increased temperature and the molecular excitation followed by the Marangoni effect. Chemical cross-linking reactions to resin system were evidenced by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), resulting in a fully <b>cured</b> <b>ink</b> with reduced electrical resistivity. Epoxy-based silver ink's physical properties such as density, thermal conductivity were mathematically defined based on a new temperature evolution for use in a 3 -D finite element (FE) modelling. A Time-dependent solver was chosen for modelling the thermal field in a 532 nm laser curing process of epoxy-based conductive silver ink within COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 3 b.
