It is this separation between visible appearance and invisible reality which allows the dissimulation of our real feelings and which grounds the possibility of sham and hypocrisy, which are forms of lies.|$|E
25|$|The {{small village}} of Santo António de Lisboa (Saint Anthony of Lisbon) {{is an example}} of colonial period {{architecture}} and in Ribeirão da Ilha, the oldest part of the capital, the inhabitants still speak the Azorean dialect which is difficult to <b>understand</b> <b>at</b> first. In Ribeirão da Ilha is the church of Our Lady of Lapa do Ribeirão, built in 1806. Lagoa da Conceição, with its many sand dunes, restaurants and seaside night life and where women make lace to sell in the street, has also managed to retain many traces of its colonial architecture.|$|E

The official language is English {{and the national}} language is Urdu, the census indicates that around 8% of the population speak Urdu as their first language. However, due to rapid urbanization and modernization, the use of Urdu as a primary language is increasing, especially amongst the growing urbanized middle class of Pakistan. Most Pakistanis speak or <b>understand</b> <b>at</b> least two to three languages and almost all Pakistanis speak or understand the national language, Urdu.|$|E

25|$|Davidson's work is {{well noted}} for its unity, as he has brought a similar {{approach}} {{to a wide variety}} of philosophical problems. Radical interpretation is a hypothetical standpoint which Davidson regards as basic to the investigation of language, mind, action, and knowledge. Radical interpretation involves imagining that you are placed into a community which speaks a language you do not <b>understand</b> <b>at</b> all. How could you come to understand the language? One suggestion is that you know a theory that generates a theorem of the form 's means that p' for every sentence of the object language (i.e. the language of the community), where s is the name of a sentence in the object language, and p is that sentence, or a translation of it, in the metalanguage in which the theory is expressed. However, Davidson rejects that suggestion on the grounds that the sentential operator 'means that' is sensitive not only to the extensions of the terms that follow it, but also to their intensions. Hence, Davidson replaces 'means that' with a connective sensitive only to the extensions of sentences; since the extension of a sentence is its truth value, this is a truth functional connective. Davidson elects the biconditional (if and only if) as the connective needed in a theory of meaning. He concludes that a theory of meaning must be such that for each sentence of the object language it generates a theorem of the form 's is true if and only if p'. A theory of truth for a language can serve as a theory of meaning.|$|E

500|$|With a {{new name}} and label, the band {{released}} its second album, New American Gospel, in September 2000. Patrick Kennedy of Allmusic compared the band to Pantera stating, [...] "The essential signatures of post-Pantera metal are in abundance on Lamb of God's inaugural album. New American Gospel provides a mighty oak upon which gritty American metal's faith is maintained, effectively bridging the '90s' insistence upon drill-sergeant technicality and the old school's determined focus on riff construction." [...] Chris Adler commented: [...] "This is a classic record. We had all the elements come together to make one of the heaviest, yet contagious records of our career. It was difficult to contain us—we didn't even <b>understand</b> <b>at</b> the time what we had created." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "neo-operatic" [...] {{opening track}} [...] "Foolish Love", {{arranged}} by Van Dyke Parks, {{was described by}} Allmusic contributor Matthew Greenwald as a [...] "lush, orchestral-soaked ballad, with incredible strings". He asserted that Wainwright's lyrics {{took the form of}} a letter to himself, defining his goals and [...] "sense of purpose". The song [...] "Danny Boy", with its [...] "fabulous wordplay that stays literate and easy to <b>understand</b> <b>at</b> the time", contains [...] "subtle" [...] horn lines and sampled percussion. The song alludes to Wainwright's homosexuality, which Greenwald considered a [...] "brave move". According to biographer Kirk Lake, [...] "Danny Boy" [...] is a companion piece to [...] "Foolish Love" [...] and together they represent the start and end of a relationship between a gay and a straight man. Danny, the straight [...] "drug-addled" [...] title figure with whom Wainwright had a three-year relationship, is the subject of both songs in addition to others on the album; he appears in the album's collage artwork. Wainwright sings of being so blinded by love that he fails to notice the [...] "ship with eight sails" [...] threatening to come around the bend, a reference to Bertolt Brecht's 1928 musical The Threepenny Opera.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, the {{long-term}} {{efforts of a}} Navy Jewish chaplain, Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff, to convince the Department of Defense {{to participate in the}} national DRVH were successful. For a number of years he had been making the case at many levels of military leadership that General Eisenhower had already initiated a remembrance program when, after U.S. forces liberated Ohrdruf (a sub-camp of Buchenwald), Eisenhower called for reporters from the U.S. and U.K. to document evidence of the Holocaust, so that, Eisenhower said, the time would never come when such atrocities could be denied, and reports about them could be regarded as mere propaganda. [...] Additionally, Eisenhower's words -- that the American GI did not always understand what he was fighting for, so he should see this evidence, to <b>understand,</b> <b>at</b> least, what he was fighting against —became, Resnicoff successfully argued, the foundation of an historic military effort to remember and learn from the Holocaust that today's military had the duty to honor and carry on.|$|E
2500|$|Some reviews were negative. Thomas Lee of San Francisco Chronicle {{called it}} [...] "a mishmash of jumbled images, {{annoying}} jump cuts and pretentious philosophy/pseudo-psychobabble, the movie {{will no doubt}} appeal to hard-core fans of Godard... But {{for the rest of}} us mortal human beings who prefer some semblance of coherence and meaningful thought, 'Goodbye to Language' will sorely disappoint." [...] Daniel Engber of Slate criticized the film's incoherent plot but praised its 3D innovations. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post called it a [...] "snooze fest" [...] and wrote that Godard was [...] "a cranky 83-year-old bore pretentiously lecturing on cinema and the world in a private language only film critics and Upper West Side audiences pretend to <b>understand</b> <b>at</b> this point." [...] Marc Mohan of The Oregonian called it [...] "a dense collage of sound and image, without a coherent narrative, that deconstructs cinema and history in provocative and often incomprehensible ways." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, {{while working}} at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Fermi had a casual {{conversation}} while walking to lunch with colleagues Emil Konopinski, Edward Teller and Herbert York.

2500|$|One of Reed's sore points {{resulting}} from that unauthorized re-editing {{was that the}} [...] "heavenly wine and roses" [...] melody was cut out of [...] "Sweet Jane". In the original recording, this part was intended to provide a perfectly flowing bridge to a full-fledged plagal cadence two-chord version of the chorus (earlier choruses in the song have a 4-chord riff). In Reed's initial solo performances, he would include the verse (see for instance American Poet), until 1973, when he would routinely leave it out, as the bridge fits less well in a more hard rock version (as heard for instance on Rock 'n' Roll Animal). However, the post-Reed, Doug Yule-led Velvets always performed the song with the verse included. A career-spanning retrospective of Reed's recordings with the Velvet Underground and as a solo artist, NYC Man (The Ultimate Collection 1967–2003), which Reed compiled himself, uses the shorter version. When asked about the shortened versions of [...] "Sweet Jane" [...] and [...] "New Age" [...] and Reed's long-standing claims that they were re-edited without his consent, Yule claimed that Reed had in fact edited the songs himself. [...] "He edited it. You have to <b>understand</b> <b>at</b> the time, the motivation was... Lou was, {{and all of us}} were, intent on one thing and that was to be successful and what you had to do to be successful in music, was you had to have a hit, and a hit had to be uptempo, short, and with no digressions, straight ahead basically, you wanted a hook and something to feed the hook and that was it. 'Sweet Jane' was arranged just exactly the way it is on the original Loaded release exactly for that reason—to be a hit! 'Who Loves The Sun' was done exactly that way for that reason—to be a hit." ...|$|E
