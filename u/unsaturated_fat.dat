25|$|The {{effect of}} {{saturated}} fat on risk of disease is controversial. Many reviews recommend a diet low in saturated fat and argue it will lower risks of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, or death. However, other reviews have challenged those arguments or advocated for examining the proportion of saturated to <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> in the diet.|$|E

Approximately 65% {{of the fat}} in milk chocolate is saturated, composed mainly of palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> is oleic acid (table, see USDA reference for full report).|$|E
25|$|Various fats contain {{different}} {{proportions of}} saturated and <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fat.</b> Examples of foods containing {{a high proportion}} of saturated fat include animal fat products such as cream, cheese, butter, other whole milk dairy products and fatty meats which also contain dietary cholesterol. Certain vegetable products have high saturated fat content, such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil. Many prepared foods are high in saturated fat content, such as pizza, dairy desserts, and sausage.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{unsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} are palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, myristoleic acid, linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid. Foods containing <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> include avocado, nuts, and vegetable oils such as canola and olive oils. Meat products contain both saturated and <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fats.</b>|$|R

25|$|Fats contain long {{hydrocarbon}} chains, {{which can}} either be unsaturated, i.e., have double bonds, or saturated, i.e., have no double bonds. In nature, unsaturated fatty acids generally have cis as opposed to trans configurations. In food production, liquid cis-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties, e.g. they melt at a desirable temperature (30–40°C). Partial hydrogenation of the <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> converts some of the cis double bonds into trans double bonds by an isomerization reaction with the catalyst used for the hydrogenation, which yields a trans fat.|$|E
25|$|Diet: as {{the colon}} {{is exposed to}} many dietary {{substances}} which may encourage inflammation, dietary factors have been hypothesized {{to play a role}} in the pathogenesis of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Few studies have investigated such an association; one study showed no association of refined sugar on the prevalence of ulcerative colitis. High intake of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> and vitamin B6 may enhance the risk of developing ulcerative colitis. Other identified dietary factors that may influence the development and/or relapse of the disease include meat protein and alcoholic beverages. Specifically, sulfur has been investigated as being involved in the etiology of ulcerative colitis, but this is controversial. Sulfur restricted diets have been investigated in patients with UC and animal models of the disease. The theory of sulfur as an etiological factor is related to the gut microbiota and mucosal sulfide detoxification in addition to the diet.|$|E
2500|$|Trans fat, or [...] trans-unsaturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids, are {{a type of}} <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> {{that occur}} in small amounts in nature, but became widely {{produced}} industrially from vegetable fats for use in margarine, snack food, packaged baked goods, and frying fast food starting in the 1950s. Trans fat {{has been shown to}} consistently be associated, in an intake-dependent way, with increased risk of coronary artery disease, a leading cause of death in Western nations.|$|E

5000|$|Although both {{monounsaturated}} and polyunsaturated fats {{can replace}} saturated {{fat in the}} diet, trans <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> should not. Replacing saturated <b>fats</b> with <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> helps lower levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in the blood. Trans <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> are an exception because the double bond stereochemistry predisposes the carbon chains to assume a linear conformation, which conforms to rigid packing as in plaque formation. The geometry of the cis double bond induces {{a bend in the}} molecule, thereby precluding rigid formations (see [...] links above for drawings that illustrate this). Natural sources of fatty acids (see above) are rich in the cis isomer.|$|R
2500|$|The major {{evidence}} for the effect of trans fat on CHD comes from the Nurses' Health Study— a cohort study that has been following 120,000 female nurses {{since its inception in}} 1976. In this study, Hu and colleagues analyzed data from 900 coronary events from the study's population during 14 years of followup. He determined that a nurse's CHD risk roughly doubled (relative risk of 1.93, CI: 1.43 to 2.61) for each 2% increase in trans fat calories consumed (instead of carbohydrate calories). By contrast, for each 5% increase in saturated fat calories (instead of carbohydrate calories) there was a 17% increase in risk (relative risk of 1.17, CI: 0.97 to 1.41). [...] "The replacement of saturated fat or trans <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> by cis (unhydrogenated) unsaturated fats was associated with larger reductions in risk than an isocaloric replacement by carbohydrates." [...] Hu also reports on the benefits of reducing trans fat consumption. Replacing 2% of food energy from trans fat with non-trans unsaturated fats more than halves the risk of CHD (53%). By comparison, replacing a larger 5% of food energy from saturated fat with non-trans unsaturated fats reduces the risk of CHD by 43%.|$|E
2500|$|A {{molecule}} {{of dietary}} fat typically consists of several fatty acids (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a glycerol. They are typically found as triglycerides (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may {{be classified as}} saturated or unsaturated depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats {{have all of the}} carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms double-bonded, so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids. Trans fats are a type of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> with trans-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) hydrogenation. [...] There are nine kilocalories in each gram of fat. Fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acid, catalpic acid, eleostearic acid and punicic acid, in addition to providing energy, represent potent immune modulatory molecules.|$|E

50|$|A {{saturated}} fat {{is a type}} of fat in which the fatty acid chains have all or predominantly single bonds. A fat is made of two kinds of smaller molecules: glycerol and fatty acids. Fats are made of long chains of carbon (C) atoms. Some carbon atoms are linked by single bonds (-C-C-) and others are linked by double bonds (-C=C-). Double bonds can react with hydrogen to form single bonds. They are called saturated, because the second bond is broken up and each half of the bond is attached to (saturated with) a hydrogen atom. Most animal fats are saturated. The fats of plants and fish are generally <b>unsaturated.</b> Saturated <b>fats</b> tend to have higher melting points than their corresponding <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fats,</b> leading to the popular understanding that {{saturated fat}}s tend to be solids at room temperatures, while <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> tend to be liquid at room temperature with varying degrees of viscosity (meaning both saturated and <b>unsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> are found to be liquid at body temperature).|$|R
