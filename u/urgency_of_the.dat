In two weeks of heavy fighting, the US forces were able to force the North Koreans out of the Naktong Bulge region. The North Koreans were further repulsed after the UN counterattack at Inchon, which culminated in the virtual destruction of the North Korean army.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941, when the Armored Force expanded, an urgent need for {{self-propelled}} artillery arose. Although a full-track chassis was preferred, the situation required the use of whatever vehicles were immediately available. The M3 Half-track was selected to carry a 105mm M2A1 howitzer. Although this design had originally been suggested in September 1941, {{it had not been}} taken up. However, the <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> requirement resulted in the approval by the Adjutant General and the construction of a prototype was authorized by OCM 17391, dated 31 October 1941; the new vehicle designated as the 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage T19.|$|E

5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. The <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E
5|$|The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general {{election}} {{and led by}} Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress (led by Mahatma Gandhi) and the Muslim League (led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah)—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to {{how it should be}} implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than June 30, 1948. When the <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.|$|E

40|$|In some environments, {{there is}} a serious {{mismatch}} between <b>the</b> perceived (psychoacoustic) <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> a warning and its situational urgency. This pilot study investigated effect of pulse format, pulse duration, and time between pulses on <b>the</b> perceived <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> warning signals. <b>The</b> intent was to determine <b>the</b> best combination <b>of</b> variables and levels of variables to use in a formal study on <b>the</b> perceived <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> warning signals. <b>The</b> results indicated that only pulse format and time between pulses were significant. Subjects rated sequential pulses as being less urgent than any other format. Signals with shorter inter-pulse intervals were rated as significantly more urgent. Pulse format and time between pulses were determined to be variables which should be used in future research. BACKGROUND Auditory warning signals have found their way into many environments.

The Court observed that advocates of surgery were more numerous than opponents, alternatives to surgery were not entirely feasible, and surgeries had improved, “making it less likely that sexual sensitivity would be destroyed; and the medical community was improving communication with parents”.|$|E

Chow explained that he received a revised script a week earlier and was not given sufficient time to prepare, but producer Terence Chang disputed this, saying that he could not work with Chow because the film's Hollywood insurer opposed 73 clauses in Chow's contract. Chow was replaced by Tony Leung, who had previously turned down the role of Zhuge Liang, as he was exhausted after filming Lust, Caution; but offered to rejoin the cast because of the <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter.|$|E

25|$|Conventionally, {{caesarean}} sections {{are classified}} as being either an elective surgery or an emergency operation. Classification is used to help communication between the obstetric, midwifery and anaesthetic team for discussion of the most appropriate method of anaesthesia. The decision whether to perform general anesthesia or regional anesthesia (spinal or epidural anaesthetic) is important {{and is based on}} many indications, including how urgent the delivery needs to be as well as the medical and obstetric history of the woman. Regional anaesthetic is almost always safer for the woman and the baby but sometimes general anaesthetic is safer for one or both, and the classification of <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> delivery is an important issue affecting this decision.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish coup of July 1936 dealt {{a severe}} {{blow to the}} {{structure}} of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces, which ended up fragmented on the basis of joining the rebels or remaining loyal to the established government. The failure of the coup, especially in the main cities, Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia, along with the collapse of authority and the lack of agreement in the first brief negotiations, were only some of the factors that made the conflict drift towards open war. José Giral's government tried to put together a Volunteer Army based on the units that had remained loyal, but the <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment played in favor of the formation of popular militias that were armed by parties and trade unions.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, {{a report}} on urban {{transport}} planning policy, Traffic in Towns, was produced for the UK Department of Transport by a team headed by the architect, civil engineer and planner Colin Buchanan. While it advocated the construction and reorganisation of towns to accommodate the motor car and lorry, it stressed that this {{would have to be}} balanced with restrictions, in accordance with local needs. It highlighted the <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem of dealing with the expected massive growth in road traffic, the damage it could cause to our towns and cities if unplanned, the eventual need for demand management but with implications of restricting the mass of the population from doing something they didn't see as wrong, and of the inevitable need for a change in policy as the social costs increased.|$|E

500|$|Further to the {{betrayal}} they had felt at Lennon's non-activist stance in [...] "Revolution", New Left commentators condemned The Beatles for {{its failure to}} offer a political agenda. The Beatles themselves were accused of using eclecticism and pastiche {{as a means of}} avoiding important issues in the turbulent political and social climate. Jon Landau, writing for the Liberation News Service, argued that, particularly in [...] "Piggies" [...] and [...] "Rocky Racoon", the band had adopted parody because they were [...] "afraid of confronting reality" [...] and [...] "the <b>urgencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment". Like Landau, many writers among the New Left considered the album outdated and irrelevant; instead, they heralded the Rolling Stones' concurrent release, Beggars Banquet, as what Lennon biographer Jon Wiener terms [...] "the 'strong solution,' a musical turning outward, toward the political and social battles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day".|$|R
