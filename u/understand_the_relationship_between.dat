500|$|Experimental {{research}} on consciousness presents special difficulties, {{due to the}} lack of a universally accepted operational definition. In the majority of experiments that are specifically about consciousness, the subjects are human, and the criterion used is verbal report: [...] in other words, subjects are asked to describe their experiences, and their descriptions are treated as observations of the contents of consciousness. [...] For example, subjects who stare continuously at a Necker cube usually report that they experience it [...] "flipping" [...] between two 3D configurations, even though the stimulus itself remains the same. [...] The objective is to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the conscious awareness of stimuli (as indicated by verbal report) and the effects the stimuli have on brain activity and behavior. In several paradigms, such as the technique of response priming, the behavior of subjects is clearly influenced by stimuli for which they report no awareness, and suitable experimental manipulations can lead to increasing priming effects despite decreasing prime identification (double dissociation).|$|E
500|$|Genetic {{studies to}} date have been {{inconclusive}} about the closest relative of the Sorraia. On one hand, studies using mitochondrial DNA showed {{a relationship with the}} Przewalski's Horse, in that Przewalski's Horse has a unique haplotype (A2) not found in domestic horses, which differs by just one single nucleotide from one of the major Sorraia haplotypes (JSO41, later A7). In comparison, genetic distances within the domestic horse are as large as 11 nucleotide differences. [...] However, this relationship with the Przewalski's Horse was contradicted in another study using microsatellite data that showed that the genetic distance between the Prewalski's Horse and the Sorraia was the largest. Such conflicting results can arise when a population passes through a genetic bottleneck, and evidence suggests that the Sorraia, among other rare breeds, has recently passed through a bottleneck, effectively obscuring the position of this breed in the family tree of the domestic horse. Thus, the morphological, physiological, and cultural characteristics of the Sorraia are the subject of continued study to better <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> various Iberian horse breeds and wild horse subspecies.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Robert Bridges's {{analysis}} of the poem became a dominant view and would influence later interpretations of the poem. Bridges, in 1895, declared that the poem was the best of Keats's odes but he thought that the poem contained too much artificial language. In particular, he emphasised {{the use of the word}} [...] "forlorn" [...] and the last stanza as being examples of Keats's artificial language. In [...] "Two odes of Keats's" [...] (1897), William C Wilkinson suggested that [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is deeply flawed because it contains too many [...] "incoherent musings" [...] that failed to supply a standard of logic that would allow the reader to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the poet and the bird. However, Herbert Grierson, arguing in 1928, believed Nightingale to be superior to [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", [...] "Ode on Melancholy", and [...] "Ode to Psyche", arguing the exact opposite of Wilkinson as he stated that [...] "Nightingale", along with [...] "To Autumn", showed a greater amount of logical thought and more aptly presented the cases they were intended to make.|$|E

500|$|In {{terms of}} labour process theory—the attempt to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> {{management}} control, worker skill and wages in industrial workplaces—Filtzer emphasised the continuing absence of control by Soviet workers {{over their own}} labour process. The Soviet elite would not radically change the labour process by democratising it and introducing truly equal wages for everyone in society, but nor could they generate the culture of consumerism that in the West was used to help explain the wage and skill structure. [...] In these circumstances, attempts to coordinate production quotas, wages and expected levels of worker effort failed and continued to fail into the 1980s. [...] The wage reform of 1956–1962 was a failure, as it could neither fix nor improve the economic conflict between workers and the elite in the Soviet Union. [...] On the shop floor, workers continued to directly bargain with low-level management over effort, wages and what [...] "skill" [...] they would exert. In particular, Filtzer notes that Soviet workers were constantly forced into a position of exerting more skill than was officially called for in plans or quotas. This was because Soviet workers often had {{to find their own}} ways of working around problems that made their efforts difficult, such as building their own tools to carry out tasks that could not be performed with the tools provided, or by devising entirely new production processes of their own when existing processes were not suitable. This was a condition only seen to such an extent in the West in industries that were insulated from market forces. Because this was common in Soviet industry, workers and managers in the Soviet Union had many reasons to work together in the setting of wages, quotas and skill expectations, even after the wage reform. Filtzer wrote that Mikhail Gorbachev attempted a very similar series of wage reforms in 1986 (Perestroika), which ultimately failed and had to be replaced with a decentralised system in 1991.|$|E

Ultima knows the ways of the Catholic Church and also the ways of the indigenous spiritual practices over which she is master. Ultima understands the philosophy and the morality of the ancient peoples of New Mexico and teaches Tony through example, experience and critical reflection, the universal principles that explain and sustain life. Although she is generally respected in the community, people sometimes misunderstand her power. At times she is referred to as a bruja, or witch, but no one—not even Antonio—knows whether or not she is truly a witch. Finally Antonio puts pieces of the puzzle together and the revelation of who she is comes to him. She holds Antonio's destiny in her hands, {{and at the end of}} the story sacrifices her own life so that Antonio might live.|$|E

2500|$|Set in {{the small}} town of Guadalupe, New Mexico just after World War II, Antonio Márez y Luna (Tony) tells his story from the {{memories}} of his adult self, who reflects on his growing up. The novel opens as the protagonist, Antonio, approaches the age of seven when his family decides to house Ultima, an elderly curandera. Ultima, known as “La Grande” in the Márez household, embodies the wisdom of her ancestors and carries the powers to heal, to confront evil, knowledge of how to use the power of nature and the ability to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the living and the spirits. Tony's parents both hold conflicting views about Tony's destiny and battle over his future path. In the first chapter Anaya establishes the roots of this struggle through Tony's dream—a flashback to the day of his birth. In his dream, Tony views the differences between his parents' familial backgrounds. His father's side, the Márez (descendents of the sea), are the restless vaqueros who roam the llanos and seek adventure. The Lunas, his mother's side, are the people of the moon, religious farmers whose destiny is to homestead and work the land. Each side of the family wants control of the newborn's future. His mother's dream is for him to become a Roman Catholic priest, his father's dream is to embark on a new adventure and move west to California with his sons to recapture the openness of the Llano he has foregone in moving to the town. As the two families argue over Antonio’s destiny, Ultima, serving as the midwife, declares, “Only I will know his destiny.” ...|$|E
