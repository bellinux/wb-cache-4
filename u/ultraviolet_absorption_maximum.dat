40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the ascorbate-activated cleavage of sinigrin to mustard oil has been postulated as enzymatic hydrolysis of the thioglucoside to the aglucone, which undergoes spontaneous Lossen rearrangement to allyl isothiocyanate. Potassium silver sinigrate (I) served as a convenient source of the aglucone (II) for comparison. When the potassium salt was decomposed with iodide at pH 2, 97 % of the product was allyl cyanide; at pH 5, 97 % was allyl isothiocyanate; and at pH 3. 53, the two compounds were formed in equal amounts. The ratio of nitrile to isothiocyanate was proportional to hydrogen ion concentration. Enzymatic hydrolysis of sinigrin at pH 3. 2 - 5, with or without ascorbate, gave essentially the same product distribution. Treatment of potassium silver sinigrate with hydrogen cyanide at pH 6. 6 allowed spectroscopic observation of the aglucone. It (II) has an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>maximum</b> at 245 mu, E 11, 000, and a half-life of 37 seconds at 20 ° (estimated 1 minutes at 0 °). These results agree with data for and the resulting aglucone either undergoes Lossen rearrangement or is captured by another enzyme ("thiocyanase") and converted to allyl thiocyanate. Isothiocyanate once formed is not isomerized. That the thiocyanate {{is derived from the}} aglucone was demonstrated by reaction of potassium silver sinigrate with iodide and ground Thlaspi seed. The aglucone thus produced was converted efficiently to thiccyanate. Allyl isothiocyanate and allyl thiocyanate reached an equilibrium in the undiluted liquid, with 5. 1 % allyl thiocyanate at 24 ° and 8. 2 % at 100 °.

40|$|Within 5 min, resting macrophages metabolize microM {{quantities}} of exogenous arachidonic acid (20 : 4) to cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products. Mono-HETEs represent a major class of metabolites {{recovered from the}} medium. However, the quantity of mono-Hetes progressively decreases over a 60 -min incubation period, with a concomitant increase in more polar lipoxygenase products, suggesting additional metabolic fates for these hydroxy acids. This was directly confirmed by exposing resident macrophage cultures to radiolabeled 15 -, 12 -, and 5 -HETEs (1 microM). 12 - 30 % of the recovered HETEs were cell-associated and predominantly esterified into phospholipid. High pressure liquid chromatography analyses of medium extracts indicated that 50 % of each HETE was also converted to 10 or more metabolites over a 60 -min time- course, a rate slower than for 20 : 4. The major metabolite generated from each mono-HETE had the elution characteristics of a di-HETE.

The differential absorption of molybdo-chelin versus chelin at 425 nm can be used to quantify chelin. This differential absorbance is linear with increasing concentrations of Na 2 MoO 4 and was used to calculate the molar extinction coefficient of molybdochelin at 425 nm (epsilon similar to 6, 200).

As the pH of the coloured solution becomes showing a alkaline reaction, the <b>absorption</b> <b>maximum</b> at 560 mμ disappears and the <b>absorption</b> <b>maximum</b> at 490 mμ shows shifting to the opposite direction, the short wave length. 4.

As for the <b>absorption</b> <b>maximum</b> of mesobilinogen is observed shifting to the long wave length for 1 or 3 mμ more than that of stercobilinogen under the acid-and weak acid condition of pH. 6. The coloured substances of the sodium-, potassium- and ammonium salts of urobilinogen with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent display the same <b>absorption</b> <b>maxima</b> by the change of the pH value, but the <b>absorption</b> <b>maximum</b> shifts to the short wave length for 2 mμ on the occasion of preparing the salts by adding several times of the computation dosis of caustic soda, caustic potash and ammonia more than on the occasion of preparing the salts by adding the computation dosis of them or the <b>absorption</b> <b>maximum</b> of the coloured substance of stercobilinogen itself with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent at the pH 1. 4 - 1. 0, and it displays at 556 mμ. 7.

The present study suggests that the LREE-binding peptide is probably a natural peptide in D. dichotoma, and it may {{play an important role in}} hyperaccumulation of LREEs...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} betweenS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) {{and sodium}} poly(styrene sulfonate) (NaPSS) was studied {{by means of}} ultrafiltration and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorption</b> spectroscopy at several pH values and sodium sulfate concentrations. The results obtained are interpreted mainly in terms of electrostatic interactions and permit {{the evaluation of the}} binding constants under different experimental conditions. Furthermore, <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorption</b> spectroscopy data show a specific short-range interaction between the aromatic electronic system of AdoMet and the NaPSS aromatic ring. The results indicate that the binding strength is greatly affected by the AdoMet positive charge on the adenine ring. The other positive charges on both the sulfonic pole and the amino acidic group of AdoMet contribute only weakly to the binding to the polyanionic matrix, thus assuring some stability of AdoMet even at physiological pH...|$|R
40|$|Samples of two {{high-strength}} thermoplastic polyurethane Estane elastemers and one high-strength thermoset Estane elastomer {{were prepared}} {{and about a}} dozen different physical properties as well as infrared and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorption</b> spectra determined for each composition. Radiation doses of 6 to 26 x 10 /sup 6 / roentgens were applied to Polyurethane VC samples in air and in nitrogen environments and in a 50 micron vacuum. Infrared and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorption</b> spectra changes in the polymer attending the exposure are under study, evolved gases are identified in the mass spectrometer, sol-gel determinations to estsblish crosslinking/ chain scission ratios are made, and macromolecular changes in the exposed polymer are estimated using light scattering techniques, the constant load rheometer, and the dynamic extrusion rheometer, and from intrinsic viscosity data.
