This system is mathematically equivalent to the one used by Rocard in his analysis. The differential equations of motion for the system are obtained by using Lagrange's Equations. Global stability, stability in the sense of Laplace, is proved using Liapunov's second method. Four separate local stability analyses of this system are developed, two of which assume a constant angular velocity, [omega], of the <b>unbalanced</b> <b>mass</b> and two which allow for periodic variations in [omega]. These analyses are termed zero and first order respectively. The first zero order analysis is based directly on the differential equations of motion and the zero order steady state solution. The steady state torque output of the vibration exciter motor and the steady state torque requirements of the oscillator are obtained as functions of the operating frequency. Stability is determined by examining the behavior of the system {{in the vicinity of the}} intersection points of these two functions. The second zero order analysis examines the behavior of small perturbations added to the steady state solution. The system is considered stable if these perturbations disappear with time. The first first order analysis is a perturbation type, but is based on a steady state solution which allows for periodic variations in [omega]. The second first order analysis is also based on the first order perturbed equations of motion but is a Floquet type analysis. Validity criteria for the zero and first order analyses are obtained, and the zero order region of validity is plotted graphically. A representative set of systems is analyzed numerically, and the results are presented in a figure showing the stability boundary as a function of the system parameters in non-dimensional form. Two distinct types of muIti-degree-of-freedom systems are discussed. The first consists of a single oscillator mass that is free to perform planar motion. It is shown that when an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>mass</b> exciter with a uniaxial force output is mounted on the oscillator in such a way that only one mode is excited, the problem reduces to the sing le-degree-of-freedom problem. The second system consists of a series of linear sing I e-degree -of -freedom oscillators with an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>mass</b> exciter mounted on one of them. The special case of a three oscillator system with equal masses is used to demonstrate that, for systems with widely separated resonances, the "equivalent" singIe-degree-of-freedom analysis presented by Kononenko is valid. From these results it is concluded that, in any multi-degree-of-freedom system, an "equivalent" single-degree-of-freedom analysis may be used to examine the stability of the system near any resonance as long as that particular mode is the only one which is being significantly excited.

The rubber bearing dynamic stiffness coefficients are investigated in three different cases: the rotating system carrying one disk, two disks, and three disks. The experimental results show that the WLRB dynamic stiffness coefficients increase parabolically with increasing rotating speed. In addition, the predicted natural frequencies of the rotor system by the DTFM are within eight percent of experimental results...|$|E

Two DC motors were used to spin <b>unbalanced</b> <b>masses</b> as the source of excitation to the model. Thus, this produces vibration along the hand-arm model to emulate the behaviour of postural tremor phenomenon. The quantitative assessment of tremor of the hand-arm model was mainly measured and recorded using a light-weight accelerometer and a displacement laser sensor. The accelerometer converts the physical movement into acceleration signals while the laser displacement sensor was used for precise measurement due to their high sensitivity in motion. The latter transducer was directly targeted at the palm of the hand, adjacent to the location of the accelerometer. The displacement and acceleration signals were then examined in both time and frequency domains. The results from the experiment and simulation study can be used for further analysis of human hand-arm tremor (of typically a PD patient) and the development of anti-human arm tremor device that can eventually suppress the tremor...|$|R

The nonlinear gyroscopic equations can be simpli ed {{to a set of}} linear, time-varying di erential equations, owing to the linear dependence of the rotor speed in the plant dynamics. For rotors operating in high speeds, even small <b>unbalanced</b> <b>masses</b> can create large synchronous disturbances. To alleviate the forces produced due to imbalance the controller automatically balances the rotor for each operating speed. The proposed methodology addresses both the gyroscopic compensation problem due to change of the rotor speed as well as the automatic balancing problem.
