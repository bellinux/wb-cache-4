PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 4 different groups of patients who <b>underwent</b> failed hypospadias repair.

50|$|Among {{the lighter}} chalcogens (oxygen and sulfur), the most neutron-poor {{isotopes}} <b>undergo</b> proton emission, the moderately neutron-poor isotopes <b>undergo</b> electron capture or β+ decay, the moderately neutron-rich isotopes <b>undergo</b> β− decay, {{and the most}} neutron rich isotopes <b>undergo</b> neutron emission. The middle chalcogens (selenium and tellurium) have similar decay tendencies as the lighter chalcogens, but their isotopes do not <b>undergo</b> proton emission {{and some of the}} most neutron-starved isotopes of tellurium <b>undergo</b> alpha decay. Polonium's isotopes tend to decay with alpha or beta decay. Isotopes with nuclear spins are more common among the chalcogens selenium and tellurium than they are with sulfur.|$|R
40|$|Using a questionnaire, we objectively {{assessed}} the body image ofdonors who <b>underwent</b> conventional laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (L-DN) or laparoscopic single-site donor nephrectomy (LESS-DN). Subjects were 15 patients who <b>underwent</b> an L-DN and 15 who <b>underwent</b> an LESS-DN. The questionnaire consisted ofthe Body Image Questionnaire (BIQ), including a Body Image Scale (BIS) and Cosmetic Scale (CS), and a Photo-Series Questionnaire (PSQ). A higher score indicated {{a more favorable}} assessment, and patient scores were compared. Subjects were also asked which procedure they preferred {{if they had to}} <b>undergo</b> donor nephrectomy again. Pain was assessed by comparing the number oftimes an analgesic was administered during hospitalization. The average BIS score was 18. 7 points (out of 20) for patients who <b>underwent</b> an L-DN and 19. 5 points for patients who <b>underwent</b> an LESS-DN; those who <b>underwent</b> an LESS-DN had a significantly higher score (p＝ 0. 03). Patients who <b>underwent</b> an L-DN had a median CS score of 17. 5 points (out of 24) while patients who <b>underwent</b> an LESS-DN had a median CS score of 19. 1 points; those who <b>underwent</b> an LESS-DN had a higher score, but the difference in average CS scores was not significant (p＝ 0. 123). The average PSQ score was 7. 1 points for patients who <b>underwent</b> an L-DN and 8. 8 points for patients who <b>underwent</b> an LESS-DN; the higher score for LESS-patients was statistically significant (p＝ 0. 01). Patients who <b>underwent</b> an L-DN were administered an analgesic a median of 4 times during hospitalization (range : 3 - 10 times) while patients who <b>underwent</b> an LESS-DN were administered an analgesic a median of 2 times (range : 0 - 4 times), which was significantly less (p＝ 0. 01). Patients who <b>underwent</b> LESS-DN had a better body image and better cosmetic appearance than those who <b>underwent</b> LDN, thus indicating the usefulness of LESS-DN. However, a more prospective larger study needs to be performed...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Infrarenal {{abdominal}} {{aortic aneurysm}} (AAA) repair warrants lifelong surveillance. Secondary aortic intervention (SAI) outcomes {{may be affected}} by the therapeutic approach. We compared short- and long-term mortality in patients who <b>underwent</b> SAIs after initial aortic repair, either endovascular (EVAR) or open. Methods. Patients who <b>underwent</b> AAA repair between 1986 and 2010 were retrospectively identified in a vascular surgery database {{as well as those who}} <b>underwent</b> SAIs. All-cause mortality and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated. Results. We identified 149 patients who <b>underwent</b> either open AAA repair or EVAR followed by open or endovascular SAI. Seventy-seven patients (51. 7 %) <b>underwent</b> initial EVAR while 72 patients (48. 3 %) <b>underwent</b> open repair. Sixty (78 %) initial EVAR patients <b>underwent</b> secondary EVAR while 17 (22 %) patients had an open SAI. Initial open repair patients were evenly distributed between EVAR and open SAIs. Compared to EVAR, patients who <b>underwent</b> initial open repair had longer intervals between primary aortic interventions (PAIs) and SAIs. Multivariable-adjusted all-cause mortality was significantly higher for patients who <b>underwent</b> initial open AAA repair followed by EVAR when compared to patients who <b>underwent</b> endovascular PAI and SAI. Conclusion. Long-term mortality in patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysms who require SAI may be improved by an EVAR-first algorithm...|$|R
