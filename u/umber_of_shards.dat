50|$|There {{is also a}} {{requirement}} for some notification and replication mechanism between schema instances, so that the unpartitioned tables remain as closely synchronized as the application demands. This is a complex choice in the architecture <b>of</b> <b>sharded</b> systems: approaches range from making these effectively read-only (updates are rare and batched), to dynamically replicated tables (at the cost of reducing some of the distribution benefits <b>of</b> <b>sharding)</b> and many options in between.|$|R

50|$|Oracle NoSQL Database is a client-server, sharded, {{shared-nothing}} system. The data in each shard are replicated {{on each of}} the nodes which {{comprise the}} shard. It provides a simple key-value paradigm to the application developer. The major key for a record is hashed to identify the shard that the record belongs to.Oracle NoSQL Database is designed to support changing the number <b>of</b> <b>shards</b> dynamically in response to availability of additional hardware. If the number <b>of</b> <b>shards</b> changes, key-value pairs are redistributed across the new set <b>of</b> <b>shards</b> dynamically, without requiring a system shutdown and restart. A shard is made up of a single electable master node which can serve read and write requests,and several replicas (usually two or more) which can serve read requests. Replicas are kept up to date using streaming replication. Each change on the master node is committed locally to disk and also propagated to the replicas.|$|R
