5|$|In eastern Herzegovina, the KPJ {{had little}} impact until mid-August 1941, {{well after the}} initial revolt had been suppressed. During the lead-up to the mass <b>uprising,</b> the KPJ {{organisation}} in Herzegovina would not commit itself, as it was waiting for orders from the provincial organisation in Sarajevo, which was expecting direction from the KPJ Central Committee to launch a general <b>uprising</b> across Yugoslavia. Once they {{became aware of the}} German attack on the Soviet Union, the KPJ in Herzegovina voted to join the mass <b>uprising,</b> but this only occurred on 24 June, when the <b>uprising</b> was already in full swing. According to Milazzo, the rebels remained a threat throughout eastern Herzegovina well into July, although the <b>uprising</b> in Herzegovina did not advance until the Bosnia-wide revolt occurred at the end of July, by which time the KPJ was ready for active involvement in the fighting.|$|E

40|$|This chapter aims {{to place}} the Arab <b>uprisings</b> of 2011 in {{historical}} perspective, addressing questions of change and continuity by comparing and contrasting these <b>uprisings</b> with previous cases of contentious mobilization in the region, {{going back to the}} nineteenth century. The chapter argues that the <b>uprisings</b> can be linked to growing protests against domestic regimes in the region since the 1970 s, and are similar to people-power <b>uprisings</b> {{in other parts of the}} world. The chapter points to the under-researched democratic genealogies of these <b>uprisings,</b> arguing that these played an important role in securing the unity of contentious crowds. The mass <b>uprisings</b> had their surprising and creative dimensions; they emerged without any preceding state breakdown and they constituted the people as a sovereign subject in a way distinctive from anticolonial nationalis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of threats from below in the {{emergence}} of electoral authoritarianism. Mass <b>uprisings</b> for democratic regime change undermine closed authoritarian regimes by making it difficult for autocrats to maintain their regimes through repression and co-optation. Anti-regime <b>uprisings</b> also promote the establishment of electoral authoritarianism by toppling existing closed regimes or by compelling autocrats to offer political reform as a survival strategy. My analysis of closed authoritarian regimes, from 1961 to 2006, reveals that anti- regime mass <b>uprisings</b> are significantly associated with transitions to electoral authoritarianism. I also find that nonviolent <b>uprisings</b> are more likely than violent <b>uprisings</b> to result in the establishment of electoral authoritarianism and that the effect of anti-regime <b>uprisings</b> on transitions to electoral authoritarianism is greater when a country is surrounded by more democracies or is ethnically or religiously homogeneous...|$|R
5|$|The Serb <b>uprising</b> of 1596–97, {{also known}} as the Herzegovina <b>uprising</b> of 1596–97, was a {{rebellion}} organized by Serbian Patriarch Jovan Kantul (s. 1592–1614) and led by Grdan, the vojvoda ("duke") of Nikšić against the Ottomans in the Sanjak of Herzegovina and Montenegro Vilayet, during the Long Turkish War (1593–1606). The <b>uprising</b> broke out {{in the aftermath of the}} failed Banat <b>Uprising</b> in 1594 and the burning of Saint Sava's relics on April 27, 1595; it included the tribes of Bjelopavlići, Drobnjaci, Nikšić and Piva. The rebels, defeated at the field of Gacko (Gatačko Polje) in 1597, were forced to capitulate due to a lack of foreign support.|$|E

Many more conspiracies intended to create rebellions were discovered and ended by Europeans before they could materialize.

25|$|The {{immediate}} nationwide <b>uprisings</b> {{against the}} new government began with the 1979 Kurdish rebellion and the Khuzestan <b>uprisings,</b> along with the <b>uprisings</b> in Sistan and Baluchestan and other areas.

Although both nationalists and Marxists had initially joined with Islamists to overthrow the Shah, tens of thousands were executed by the new regime afterwards.|$|R

He returned in 2009 when he co-founded Al Wafa' opposition group and became its official spokesperson. He played a bigger role in the uprising; he was not arrested when the <b>uprising</b> began nor was he outside the country. Hussain led the first demonstration in the <b>uprising</b> {{in the early hours of}} 14 February. He is also credited with suggesting autonomous action and total decentralization of the protest movement which was adopted by February 14 Youth Coalition, the group behind the call for an <b>uprising</b> in order to avoid getting infiltrated by government.|$|E
5|$|According to the Polish {{historian}} Tadeusz Mańczuk, Piłsudski – who {{was planning}} a coup d'état in Kaunas – discouraged the local PMO activists from {{carrying out the}} Sejny <b>Uprising.</b> Piłsudski reasoned that any hostilities could leave Lithuanians even more opposed to the proposed union with Poland (see Międzymorze). The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched the <b>uprising.</b> While locally successful, {{it led to the}} failure of the nationwide coup.|$|E
5|$|After the Great <b>Uprising,</b> the Prussians rose {{a number}} of times against the Knights, but these uprisings were much smaller in scale and posed no real danger to the Teutonic Knights, who could {{concentrate}} on further conquests. The number of uprisings is variously considered to be two or three.. They were suppressed within a year or two and showed exhaustion and division of the Prussian tribes. The third <b>uprising</b> in 1276 was provoked by Skalmantas, leader of the Sudovians, who successfully raided Teutonic lands. The next year he, with help from the Lithuanians, led 4,000 men into the Culmerland (Chełmno Land). The <b>uprising</b> failed to spread after Theodoric, vogt of Sambia, convinced the Sambians not to join the insurrection; Natangians and Warmians had also accepted baptism and promised their loyalty to the Knights. The Pogesanians alone continued the fight and were crushed. Survivors with their Bartian chief escaped to Hrodna in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania where they joined some of the Bartians, Skalvians, and all of the Nadruvians, who fled there after the Great <b>Uprising.</b>|$|E

5|$|Between {{the end of}} the Warsaw Ghetto <b>Uprising</b> (May 1943) and {{beginning}} of 1944, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Jews hiding in the Ghetto ruins. The number of Robinsons after the Warsaw <b>Uprising</b> has been estimated at between several hundred and two thousand, spread across all the suburbs of Warsaw. Another source gives the number as between 400 and 1,000. Most of those hiding were Jewish, including some who had been in hiding since the fall of the ghetto <b>uprising,</b> though a significant number were non-Jewish Poles. Unlike Szpilman, whose case was somewhat unrepresentative, most of those in hiding remained in medium-sized to large groups, often of mixed ethnicities. The majority of the Robinsons were men.|$|E
40|$|At {{least since}} Schelling (1960), theorists {{have argued that}} mass <b>uprisings</b> are a {{co-ordination}} problem. As such, it is striking that much recent game theoretic work on mass <b>uprisings</b> focuses on models known as “global games of regime change”, which typically yield a unique equilibrium. This {{raises questions about the}} validity of im-portant arguments—such as Schelling’s (1960) analysis of spontaneous revolutions or Weingast’s (1997) analysis of the foundations of accountability—which rely on equilib-rium multiplicity. I argue that the assumptions driving equilibrium uniqueness in global games are not compelling for models of mass <b>uprisings.</b> I also show {{that it is possible to}} model mass <b>uprisings</b> in a way that retains the attractive features of global games while avoiding such assumptions. The analysis highlights the importance of introducing uncertainty into models of mass <b>uprisings</b> in substantively motivated ways that do not, inadvertently, rule out deep arguments about the strategic logic of such phenomena...|$|R

5|$|During the <b>uprising,</b> the Sejm {{realized}} {{the need for}} unified national insignia {{that could be used}} by the Polish military. On February 7, 1831 it adopted white and red, the tinctures (colors) of the Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms, as the national cockade of Poland. The white-and-red cockade was henceforth worn by Polish soldiers in the November <b>Uprising,</b> as well as by participants of the Kraków <b>Uprising</b> of 1846, Polish freedom fighters in the Grand Duchy of Posen and the Austrian Empire during the Spring of Nations of 1848, and Polish insurgents during the January <b>Uprising</b> of 1863–1864. White and red colors were also used by civilians to show their protest against the Russian rule, as well as by people in France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and other countries as a sign of their sympathy with the Polish cause. The Sejm's decision was not, however, immediately accepted by all. Left-wing politicians of the time, such as Joachim Lelewel, continued to regard the revolutionary blue, white and red as true national colors. Tricolor standards were used by some Polish guerrilla units during the January <b>Uprising.</b>|$|E
