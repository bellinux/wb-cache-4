Most of these mutations {{have been reported to}} be occurring in the N-terminus and few in the trans-membrane regions but very rarely in the much conserved cytoplasmic C-terminus. Populations belonging to different ethnic groups have been extensively analyzed and a database has been created recording the details of mutations related to OA1. A total of 25 missense, 2 nonsense, 9 frameshift, and 5 splicing mutations have been reported till date. In addition to these mutations, there also occur several deletions in one or many of the exons of Oa1 gene, especially exon 2. These deletions are presumed to be because of <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> due to the presence of flanking Alu regions. In some cases, the entire Oa1 gene is deleted along with other contiguous genes. Many different polymorphisms have also been detected, mainly in intron 1.|$|E

40|$|A {{two-stage}} {{model of}} carcinogenesis is proposed based on recent {{evidence for the}} occurrence of proto-oncogenes in the vertebrate genome, evidence for gene amplification during carcinogenesis, and studies of the action of tumor promoters. The model is baed on the view that {{an increase in the}} level of gene product from such proto-oncogenes is sufficient to induce neoplastic transformation. It proposes that the initial step in carcinogenesis (initiation) is a mutation producing a tandem duplication of a proto-oncogene. Gene amplification can then occur by successive <b>unequal</b> sister chromatid <b>crossing-over</b> events in several cell cycles until sufficient gene product is produced to transform the cell...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} method is developed which {{enables us to}} treat exactly the process of coincidental evolution under mutation, <b>unequal</b> intrachromosomal <b>crossing-over</b> as well as ordinary crossing-over between homologous chromosomes in a finite population of the effective size N. It makes use of finite difference equations involving two quantities denoted by fi and phi i, in which fi is the identity coefficient of two gene members that are i steps apart on the same chromosome and phi i is that of two members i steps apart on two homologous chromosomes. When the number of genes (n) per family is large, the finite difference equations can be approximately by ordinary second-order differential equations which can then be solved analytically. Results obtained by the present method are compared with the corresponding results previously obtained by one of us (T. O.) using conventional diffusion models of gene frequency changes in population genetics. It is shown that the previous results obtained by T. O. regarding second-order statistics are essentially valid, and they give good approximations particularly when N beta is small, where beta is the rate of ordinary interchromosomal crossing-over within the multigene family...|$|R
40|$|Dantu {{is a rare}} antigen of {{the human}} MNSs blood group system carried by a hybrid glycophorin on the {{erythrocyte}} membrane. To delineate its structure and relationship to alpha and delta glycophorins at the genomic level, we analyzed DNA from a three-generation family, in which both the presence of Dantu and Mi-III (another rare MNSs antigen) {{and the absence of}} delta glycophorin were seen. Three gross alterations in the gene cluster correlated with the observed phenotypes. Differential hybridization, secondary restriction analysis, and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probing established that Dantu glycophorin is encoded by a distinct hybrid gene derived from fusion of delta and alpha genes. The junction point of the Dantu gene was assigned to the region spanning codons 31 - 39 of delta and codons 72 - 79 of alpha genes. Dosage quantitation suggested that Dantu gene is duplicated and tandemly arranged. Identification of delta gene deletion disclosed the molecular basis for the absence of delta glycophorin in two Dantu and Mi-III double heterozygotes. The DNA inheritance pattern together with DNA typing of MN blood groups verified the genotypes and established that the duplicated Dantu hybrid gene is linked to alpha M gene as well as a delta gene deletion. The origin of such a haplotype in a segment of Black population would require two recombination events via either <b>unequal</b> homologous <b>crossing-over</b> or gene conversion...|$|R

In 1913, he determined that genes were arranged on chromosomes in a linear fashion, like beads on a necklace. He also showed that the gene for any specific trait was in a fixed location (locus).|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} described Gm (g) and Gm (n) genetic {{markers of}} the γG 3 - and γG 2 -subgroups of γ-globulin were characterized in detail primarily through studies of myeloma proteins, their polypeptide chains and fragments. Antisera derived from rabbits, non-human primates and rheumatoid arthritis patients gave identical results. This {{contrasted with the}} Gm (b) system where the rabbit antisera react with a different genetic determinant (b 0) than the sera from rheumatoid arthritis patients (b). The Gm (g) and Gm (n) antigens were detected both by precipitin analysis and by hemagglutination inhibition. The Gm (g) antigen {{was not associated with}} any of the other genetic antigens of the γG 3 -proteins which all belonged in the Gm (b) class. The genes for the latter were always allelic to the gene coding for Gm (g), with that for Gm (b 0) constantly present when that for Gm (g) was absent. The Gm (g) and Gm (n) markers were of particular value in tracing the various gene complexes made up of the closely linked subgroup genes. Further support was gained for the concept that the different gene complexes of various population groups arose primarily through crossing-over. The Gmg and Gmb genes for the γG 3 -subgroup were extremely closely linked to those for the γG 1 -subgroup. However the Gm (n) marker indicated that the γG 2 -subgroup genes were probably further separated on the chromosome. Additional evidence was obtained for the γG 2 -γG 3 -γG 1 -order of the subgroup cistrons. Among the wide range of gene complexes a new type (γG 2,—,γ/G 1) was described. This complex appeared to have a deletion of the γG 3 -cistron. Lower levels of γG 3 -globulin were found in the sera of the individuals with this gene in the heterozygous state. The possibility that this unusual complex arose through an <b>unequal</b> nonhomologous <b>crossing-over</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The CYP 21 gene {{codes for}} the enzyme {{cytochrome}} P 450 c 21 (21 -hydroxylase), which is critically {{involved in the}} synthesis of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Standard human haplotypes contain two copies of CYP 21 [...] a functional gene and a pseudogene. Inactivation of the functional gene leads to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The pseudogene has three main defects: an 8 -bp deletion in exon 3, a T insertion in exon 7, and a stop codon in exon 8. To determine the origin of these defects and {{to shed light on}} the evolution of the CYP 21 gene, we sequenced relevant segments of 10 primate CYP 21 genes [...] three from a chimpanzee, another three from a gorilla, and four from an orangutan. We could show that the 8 -bp deletion is present in the chimpanzee and humans, while the other two defects are restricted to humans only. In the gorilla and the orangutan, however, extra CYP 21 copies are inactivated by other defects so that the number of functional copies is reduced in each species. Comparison of the sequences has revealed evidence for intraspecific homogenization (concerted evolution) of the CYP 21 genes, presumably through an expansion-contraction process effected by relatively frequent <b>unequal</b> but homologous <b>crossing-over...</b>|$|R
25|$|Mi-I (Mia), Mi-II(Vw), Mi-VII and Mi-VIII {{are carried}} on glycophorin A. Mi-I {{is due to}} a {{mutation}} at amino acid 28 (threonine to methionine: C->T at nucleotide 83) resulting in a loss of the glycosylation at the asparagine26 residue. Mi-II {{is due to a}} mutation at amino acid 28 (threonine to lysine:C->A at nucleotide 83). Similar to the case of Mi-I this mutation results in a loss of the glycosylation at the asparagine26 residue. This alteration in glycosylation is detectable by the presence of a new 32kDa glycoprotein stainable with PAS. Mi-VII is due to a double mutation in glycophorin A converting an arginine residue into a threonine residue and a tyrosine residue into a serine at the positions 49 and 52 respectively. The threonine-49 residue is glycosylated. This appears to be the origin of one of the Mi-VII specific antigens (Anek) which is known to lie between residues 40-61 of glycophorin A and comprises sialic acid residue(s) attached to O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide(s). This also explains the loss of a high frequency antigen ((EnaKT)) found in normal glycophorin A which is located within the residues 46-56. Mi-VIII is due to a mutation at amino acid residue 49 (arginine->threonine). M-VIII shares the Anek determinant with MiVII. Mi-III, Mi-VI and Mi-X are due to rearrangements of glycophorin A and B in the order GlyA (alpha)-GlyB (delta)-GlyA (alpha). Mil-IX in contrast is a reverse alpha-delta-alpha hybrid gene. Mi-V, MiV(J.L.) and Sta are due to <b>unequal</b> but homologous <b>crossing-over</b> between alpha and delta glycophorin genes. The MiV and MiV(J.L.) genes are arranged in the same 5' alpha-delta 3' frame whereas Sta gene is in a reciprocal 5'delta-alpha 3' configuration.|$|R
50|$|Duplications {{arise from}} an event termed <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> that occurs during meiosis between {{misaligned}} homologous chromosomes.The chance of this happening {{is a function}} of the degree of sharing of repetitive elements between two chromosomes. The products of this recombination are a duplication at the site of the exchange and a reciprocal deletion. Ectopic recombination is typically mediated by sequence similarity at the duplicate breakpoints, which form direct repeats. Repetitive genetic elements such as transposable elements offer one source of repetitive DNA that can facilitate recombination, and they are often found at duplication breakpoints in plants and mammals.|$|E
50|$|The best-known such {{process is}} the concerted {{evolution}} of genes present in many tandem copies, such as those for ribosomal RNAs or silk moth egg shell chorion proteins, in sexually reproducing species. The concept has been proposed to extend to the diversification of multigene families. The mechanisms involved include gene conversion, <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over,</b> transposition, slippage replication and RNA-mediated exchanges. Because mutations changing the sequence of one copy are less common than deletions, duplications and replacement of one copy by another, the copies gradually come to resemble each other much more than they would {{if they had been}} evolving independently.|$|E

5000|$|One of Sturtevant’s {{principal}} contributions was {{his introduction}} to the concept that the frequency of crossing-over between two genes could help determine their proximity on a linear genetic map. His experiments determined that the frequency of double crossing over {{can be used to}} deduce gene order. He demonstrated this concept by constructing crosses of three segregating genes, called [...] "three-factor crosses". He found that using three genes as opposed to two provided most accurate information about gene order on chromosome. With this system, Sturtevant discovered that double crossing-over occurs at frequency of equal to or less than product of two single crossing over frequencies. He also surmised that <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> was possibly a main force of evolution. [...] "Sturtevant... elaborated on these ideas by incorporating the conception of linear arrangement and by constructing the first chromosome map.

50|$|Klein’s group {{demonstrated}} that during its evolution, the Mhc undergoes repeated rounds of expansion and contraction by gene duplications and deletions -in Klein’s terminology, an accordion mode of evolution. Thus, for example, they {{showed that in}} each of the three major primate lineages - the prosimians, the NWM and the OWM - evolution of some of the class II gene families started anew after a contraction to a single ancestral gene. And on the example of two “class III” genes, C4 and CYP21, they illustrated a mechanism by which the accordion might be expanding and contracting. The C4 gene, as already stated, codes for a component of the complement system; the CYP21gene codes for a key enzyme in the synthesis of glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones. The two genes are thus unrelated to each other and to the class I and class II genes, but they are accidentally hooked together into a module, which has been found to duplicate or triplicate as a unit during primate evolution. The hook-up seems to have arisen, when an identical short sequence motif arose by chance at both flanks of the initial C4-CYP21 doublet. Since then, an occasional misalignment of the opposite flanks has led to an <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> and so to duplications or deletion of the module.|$|E
5000|$|Post 1982 Gottlieb {{continued}} to work on other enzyme systems produced by duplicated loci in different species. In Clarkia he reported that duplicated genes for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD) occurred throughout the genus for both cytosolic and plastid 6-PGD. In homosporus ferns he found a duplicated gene for TPI, resulting in the only case of heterozygosity resulting from gene duplication in ferns—counter to previous theory. In Layia Gottlieb [...] found that isocitrate dehydrognease (IDH) isozymes had one gene controlling plastid IDH and 2-3 duplicated genes controlling cytosolic IDH. In this same study with Layia he found that phosphoglucomutase (PGM) also had one gene controlling plastid PGM, and duplicated cytosolic genes. He also examined six additional genera in the Madieae, and, with Layia representing 7 of the 10 genera in this tribe of the Asteraceae. Since {{he found that the}} duplicated cytosolic PGM were found in all the genera, he postulated that the duplication may have been present at the formation of this tribe, and hypothesized that examining PGM in other tribes may help understand phylogenic relationships in the Asteraceae. Further, he asserted that the discovery of duplicated genes in the tribe Madinae, along with the work of others, supported the view that duplicated genes in flowering plants was widespread. Additionally, since all such duplicated genes were unlinked, he favored the view that duplications were the result of overlapping reciprocal translocations rather than by <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over.</b> Gottlieb also appled PGM isozymes to species in the genus Clarkia, and found that some species had duplicated plastid PGM, others had duplicated cytosolic PGM, and that their phylogenetic distribution was consistent with earlier work on PGI.|$|E

By using this model, the time needed for acquiring a new gene is investigated by an approximate analytical method and by computer simulations. The model assumes that natural selection favors those chromosomes with more beneficial genes than other chromosomes in the population, as well as random genetic drift, mutation, and <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over.</b> Starting from a single gene copy, {{it is found that}} the time for acquiring another gene with a new function is dependent on the rates of occurrence of <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> and mutation. Within a realistic range of parameter values, the required time was at least several times 4 N generations, where N is the effective population size. Interchromosomal <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> at meiosis is more effective than intrachromosomal (between sister chromatids) <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> for obtaining a new gene, provided that other parameters are the same.

40|$|Small, multigene {{families}} {{organized in}} a tandem array can facilitate the rapid {{evolution of the}} gene cluster by a process of meiotic <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over.</b> To study this process in a multicellular organism, we created a synthetic RBCSB gene cluster in Arabidopsis thaliana and used this to measure directly the frequency of meiotic, intergenic <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> between sister chromatids. The synthetic RBCSB gene cluster was composed of a silent ΔRBCS 1 B∷LUC chimeric gene fusion, lacking all 5 ′ transcription and translation signals, followed by RBCS 2 B and RBC 3 B genomic DNA. Expression of luciferase activity (luc+) required a homologous recombination event between the ΔRBCS 1 B∷LUC and the RBCS 3 B genes, yielding a novel recombinant RBCS 3 B/ 1 B∷LUC chimeric gene whose expression was driven by RBCS 3 B 5 ′ transcription and translation signals. Using sensitive, single-photon-imaging equipment, three luc+ seedlings were identified in more than 1 million F 2 seedlings derived from self-fertilized F 1 plants hemizygous for the synthetic RBCSB gene cluster. The F 2 luc+ seedlings were isolated, and molecular and genetic analysis indicated that the luc+ trait {{was caused by the}} formation of a recombinant chimeric RBCS 3 B/ 1 B∷LUC gene. A predicted duplication of the RBCS 2 B gene also was present. The recombination resolution break points mapped adjacent to a region of intron I at which a disjunction in sequence similarity between RBCS 1 B and RBCS 3 B occurs; this provided evidence supporting models of gene cluster evolution by exon-shuffling processes. In contrast to most measures of meiotic <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> that require the deletion of a gene in a gene cluster, these results directly measured the frequency of meiotic <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> (≈ 3 × 10 − 6), leading to the expansion of the gene cluster and the formation of a novel recombinant gene...|$|E

[2004]; Hernandez Fernandez and Vrba [2005]). The characterization of copy number variants of satellite VI in the related deer species agrees with the satellite DNA library model as the consequence of concerted evolution (Fry and Salser [1977]; Ugarkovic and Plohl [2002]). The variable FISH signals of satellite VI were observed between some homologous chromosomes in Formosan muntjac, Formosan Sambar deer, and Formosan sika deer. Such different FISH signal strengths/intensities of satellite VI between the homologous chromosomes were most likely due to <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> events. It has been suggested that a short monomer size, such as the 11 -bp monomer size of satellite VI in this study, offers ample opportunities for <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> during meiosis and results in copy number variation between homologous chromosomes (Smith [1976]; Ugarkovic and Plohl [2002]).|$|E
40|$|The {{clustered}} protocadherins (Pcdhs) are single-pass transmembrane {{proteins that}} constitute a subfamily within the cadherin superfamily.

Interestingly, different neurons express different subsets of isoforms; however, {{little is known about}} the functions and expression of the clustered Pcdhs. Previous phylogenetic analyses that compared rodent and human clusters postulated the recent occurrence of gene duplication events. Using standard phylogenetic methods, I confirmed the prior observations, and I show that duplications are likely to occur through <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> events between two, and sometimes three, different Pcdh genes. The results are consistent with the fact that these genes undergo gene conversion. Recombination events between different clustered Pcdh genes appear to underlie concerted evolution through gene conversion and gene duplications through <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over.</b> In this work, I provided evidence that the unit of duplication of these genes in both the mouse and the human and within each cluster is the same.

Among others, analyzing the feasible set of solutions revealed that the model explained the i/i + 2 periodicity observed in the repeat number distribution of a family of receptors. In addition, in exploring discrepancies between real and simulated data we discovered an overrepresented pattern which potentially has functional importance.

40|$|Genome regions {{containing}} multiple {{copies of}} homologous genes, {{such as the}} immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain constant-region (IGHC) locus, are often unstable and give rise to duplicated and deleted haplotypes. Analysis of such processes is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms of evolution of multigene families. In the IGHC region, a number of single and multiple gene deletions, derived from either <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> or looping-out excision, have been described. To study these haplotypes at the population level, a simple and efficient method for preparing large numbers of DNA samples suitable for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis was set up, and a sample of 110 blood donors was screened. Deletions {{were found to be}} frequent, as expected on the basis of previous serological surveys for homozygotes. Furthermore, a number of multigene duplications, never identified before, were detected. The total frequency of individuals bearing rearranged IGHC haplotypes was 10 %. The genes involved in these deletions and duplications were assessed by densitometric analysis of standard Southern blots hybridized with several IGHC probes; two types of deletion and two types of duplication could thus be characterized. These data provide further evidence of the instability of the IGHC locus and demonstrate that <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> is the most likely origin of rearranged IGHC haplotypes; they also suggest that such recombination events may be relatively frequent. Moreover, the simplicity and effectiveness of the large-scale PFGE screening approach will be of great help in the study of multigene families and of other loci involved in aberrant recombinations...|$|E
40|$|From {{comparisons}} of homologous DNA sequences for many different genes, {{it was shown}} that the silent positions of protein-encoding regions and introns evolve at high and remarkably similar rates for different genes. In addition, both silent positions and introns behave like clocks; they accumulated base substitutions at approximately constant rates with respect to geological time. The rates of evolution were estimated to be 5. 5 X 10 (- 9), 3. 7 X 10 (- 9), and 5. 3 X 10 (- 9) per site per year for silent positions, short introns (less than approximately equal to 300 base pairs), and long introns (more than approximately equal to 500 base pairs), respectively. Contrary to expectation from the evolutionary clocks, DNA sequence comparison between pHLA 12. 4 (a cloned HLA sequence) of man and Ld together with other H- 2 genes of mouse, the class I genes of the major histocompatibility complex, revealed a surprisingly small amount of base substitution for both the introns and the silent positions; the degree of divergence is only about 60 % of that of standard genes in the same species comparison. Furthermore, several segmental homologies have been observed between the class I genes of mouse, suggesting the frequent occurrence of gene conversion or double <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> in evolution. Interrelations between the extreme polymorphism of the class I genes, the low evolutionary drift of the introns and the silent positions, and the frequent gene conversion or <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> within the mouse genes are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} fate of chimeric fusion genes may {{be strongly}} influenced by their recombinational mode of origin {{and the nature of}} functional divergence between the parental genes. In the β-globin gene family of placental mammals, the two postnatally expressed δ- and β-globin genes (HBD and HBB, respectively) have a propensity for recombinational exchange via gene conversion and <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over.</b> In the latter case, there are good reasons to expect differences in retention rates for the reciprocal HBB/HBD and HBD/ HBB fusion genes due to thalassemia pathologies associated with the HBD/HBB “Lepore” deletion mutant in humans. Here,were port a comparative genomic analysis of the mammalian β-globin gene cluster, which revealed that chimeric HBB/HBD fusion genes originated independently in four separate lineages of laurasiatherian mammals: Eulipotyphlans (shrews, moles, and hedgehogs), carnivores, microchiropteran bats, and cetaceans. In cases where an independently derived “anti-Lepore” duplication mutant has become fixed, the parental HBD and/or HBB genes have typically been inactivated or deleted, so that the newly created HBB/HBD fusion gene is primarily responsible for synthesizing the β-type subunits of adult and fetal hemoglobin (Hb). Contrary to conventional wisdom that the HBD gene is a vestigial relict that is typically inactivated or expressed at negligible levels,we show that HBD-like genes often encode a substantial fraction (20 – 100 %) of β-chain Hbs in laurasiatherian taxa. Our results indicate that the ascendancy or resuscitation of genes with HBD-like coding sequence requires the secondary acquisition of HBB-like promoter sequence via <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> or interparalog gene conversion...|$|E
40|$|National audienceThe {{immune system}} {{searches}} for pathogen invasion markers, which include pathogen proteins and host proteins modified {{in the course}} of the invasion. While some pathogen-associated molecular patterns are relatively invariant, numerous pathogen-specific markers change quickly. Therefore, to win the arms race with pathogens, host recognition receptors must adapt quickly to varied and modulating markers. To achieve this goal, the recognition domain of the receptor requires the capacity to recognize diverse possible pathogen molecule epitopes, and ability to quickly learn new ones. In plants and fungi, which lack an adaptive immune system, this key role in the immunity is played by the NLR family of receptors, which adapt to ever-changing pathogen-specific invasion markers thanks to their repeat-based architecture, which can produce diversity of recognition paratopes through <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> and mutation [1]. The <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> is a repeat shuffling process 10, 000 to 100, 000 times quicker than the standard point mutation, however it requires (and promotes) high sequence similarity between consecutive repeat units. At the same time certain positions in the repeats are highly variable under positive diversifying selection; they are believed to form the actual recognition paratope [2, 3]. Characterizing computationally the language of these pathogen recognition receptors can provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of immune response and describe the limits of the pathogen targets that can be recognized. In this work, we modeled generation and selection of the recognition paratopes as a stochastic string rewriting system with constraints, tuned by analysis of observed evolutionary processes and validated with regard to a large data set of fungal NLR [3]. First, we cross-checked the <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> and mutation model with the existing experimental data. Second, we analyzed mathematical properties of the model and showed that its convergence to stationary distribution. Then, we compared real and simulated data. Among others, analyzing the feasibleset of solutions revealed that the model explained the i=i+ 2 (even-odd) periodicity observed in the repeat number distribution of a family of receptors. Next, we explored discrepancies between real and simulated data in order to discover constraints acting on the paratopes. For example, by comparing amino acid content in the model and original populations, we confirmed that highly variable sites identified on the basis of entropy, were subject to constraints towards composition typical for binding sites, which was coherent with the suggested role of recognition paratopes. Finally, we proposed an interactive approach to exploring the solution space of amino acid repeats by means of 2 -d projections and significance tests in sectors of the space. In a preliminary analysis, we found an overrepresented pattern R-[SYQFW](1, 3) -R at one of the highly variable positions in a family of receptors, which potentially has functional importance. The methodology developed in this work is general and therefore can be applied to any class of amino acid repeats generated by <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> for which an equivalent high quality data set is available. An appealing future application of our model would be testing ofhypotheses regarding repeat origin or function encoded as constraints on the string rewriting system. [1] M. Paoletti, S. J. Saupe.

40|$|The first {{example of}} a {{deletion}} {{of one of the}} two gamma globin genes has been characterized through an analysis of the DNA of the heterozygous parent of a homozygous newborn, using restriction endonuclease mapping techniques. A deletion of approximately 5 kb was observed which was probably caused by an <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over</b> between the -G gamma- and -A gamma- genes resulting in the formation of a -G gamma A gamma- hybrid gene. Data on proportions of G gamma and A gamma chains in newborn babies assumed to be heterozygous for the hybrid and normal genes suggest that this hybrid gene may be producing its A gamma chain at levels normally seen only for the G gamma chain...|$|E
40|$|Tandemly {{repeated}} DNA can comprise several {{percent of}} total genomic DNA in complex organisms and, in some instances, {{may play a role}} in chromosome structure or function. Alpha satellite DNA is the major family of tandemly repeated DNA found at the centromeres of all human and primate chromosomes. Each centromere is characterized by a large contiguous array of up to several thousand kb which can contain several thousand highly homogeneous repeat units. By using a novel application of the polymerase chain reaction (repPCR), we are able to amplify a representative sampling of multiple repetitive units simultaneously, allowing rapid analysis of chromosomal subsets. Direct sequence analysis of repPCR amplified alpha satellite from chromosomes 17 and X reveals positions of sequence heterogeneity as two bands at a single nucleotide position on a sequencing ladder. The use of TdT in the sequencing reactions greatly reduces the background associated with polymerase pauses and stops, allowing visualization of heterogeneous bases found in as little as 10 % of the repeat units. Confirmation of these heterogeneous positions was obtained by comparison to the sequence of multiple individual cloned copies obtained both by PCR and non-PCR based methods. PCR amplification of alpha satellite can also reveal multiple repeat units which differ in size. Analysis of repPCR products from chromosome 17 and X allows rapid determination of the molecular basis of these repeat unit length variants, which appear to be a result of <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over.</b> The application of repPCR to the study of tandemly repeated DNA should allow in-depth analysis of intra- and interchromosomal variation and <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over,</b> thus providing insight into the biology and genetics of these large families of DNA...|$|E
40|$|A {{model to}} explain {{the high degree of}} {{polymorphism}} at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is described. The model incorporates domain transfer between the different loci in a supergene family by either gene conversion or double <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing-over.</b> Population genetics theory is used to formulate changes in the probabilities of allelic and nonallelic gene identities and equilibrium values are obtained. The observed degree of allelic and nonallelic homology in the complex can be explained by assuming that a domain is converted at a rate of 10 (- 5) to 10 (- 6) per generation and reasonable values of other parameters. This rate of domain transfer is compatible with the observed high mutation rate at marker loci in the major histocompatibility complex...|$|E
