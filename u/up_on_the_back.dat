5|$|Hamilton {{clinched}} {{his seventh}} pole {{position of the}} season with a time of 1:36.303. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Räikkönen, who qualified 0.342seconds behind Hamilton's time. Massa took third place, needing a good result to retain the possibility of a Championship victory. Alonso qualified in fourth ahead of Kovalainen, who took fifth after struggling for tyre grip during the final session. Webber was sixth fastest in the final session, but was demoted to 16th on the grid {{as a result of his}} penalty. Heidfeld originally qualified sixth, but was penalised three positions for impeding Red Bull driver David Coulthard in the first session. As a result, Toro Rosso driver Sebastian Vettel inherited sixth position, ahead of Trulli and Bourdais. Piquet took tenth position. Kubica's eleventh placing was his worst qualifying result to that point in the season, struggling with his car's set-up throughout his two sessions. Rubens Barrichello of Honda took 13th behind Timo Glock of Toyota, to reach the top 15 for the first time in ten races. Williams driver Nico Rosberg took 14th on the grid. Coulthard failed to move beyond the first session; the Red Bull driver qualified in 15th and blamed Heidfeld for his poor performance. Kazuki Nakajima of Williams, Jenson Button of Honda and the Force Indias of Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella would line <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> two rows of the grid.|$|E
25|$|Work {{was begun}} on the Great Incline with such steep grades that no mule could be flogged enough into {{negotiating}} it. Instead, materials were carried <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of laborers. Grading became a particular problem. While funiculars were usually considered to require four rails, {{two for the}} ascending car, and two for the descending car, {{there was not enough}} room to widen the grade to accommodate four rails. Over night the inventive Thaddeus Lowe {{came up with a plan}} to only use four rails where the cars pass each other and three rails on the upper and lower ends of the run, whereby the cars shared the center rail. The ingenious three-railed funicular not only fit, but it also reduced the amount of required materials. This three-railed design has been applied on other places as well (e.g. Angels Flight).|$|E
25|$|After naming an {{unchanged}} squad for {{the first}} two Tests, England were forced into a change for the third Test after Pietersen suffered a calf injury on the third day at Lord's. After much speculation regarding his replacement, Nottinghamshire batsman James Taylor was called <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of an unbeaten century against the Australians in a tour match against Sussex, for whom he was making a guest appearance. The England selectors also made the decision to allow Finn and Onions to return to their clubs, to be replaced by seamer Chris Tremlett and another spin option in Monty Panesar. Following the fourth Test at Chester-le-Street, Tim Bresnan was ruled out for the summer, so Simon Kerrigan and Chris Woakes were given surprise call-ups and would both go on to make their debuts in the fifth Test at The Oval.|$|E
5000|$|The hype {{started with}} {{affordable}} brightly colored T-shirts, jackets and caps, each accompanied by messages like [...] "Stop D Violence" [...] and [...] "Educate 2 Elevate."

50|$|The Darling River hardyhead is {{identified}} by its compressed body, small mouth, and thin lips. The eyes {{of this species}} are large and silvery. They have short dorsal fins along with a forked tail. Its small scales rarely show <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> species is gold with a silver body. Also, a dark line runs across its side.|$|R
5000|$|Some riders {{complain}} of excessive road noise vibrating through the hardshell seat. Also, the hardshell seat is [...] "closed," [...] providing no ventilation, which may cause excessive sweat to build <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cyclist's <b>back</b> <b>on</b> hot days.|$|R
500|$|Kelly {{has also}} {{provided}} songs {{for many other}} artists, tailoring them to their particular vocal range. Women at the Well (2002) had 14 female artists record his songs in tribute. According to Kelly, he adapted his song [...] "Foggy Highway" [...] for Renée Geyer because [...] "I admired her deep soul singing, ferocious and vulnerable ... When I heard the finished version ... the hairs rose <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of my neck." [...] Kelly and The Stormwater Boys recorded it in a bluegrass style as the title track for the 2005 album Foggy Highway. Divinyls' lead singer Christina Amphlett recorded [...] "Before Too Long"—she was attracted by the lyrics—she interpreted the song's narrator as being a stalker, and provided a female perspective in a darkly menacing manner à-la Fatal Attraction.|$|E
500|$|Despite Anthony Field's {{expressed}} {{dislike of}} the term [...] "branding", preferring to {{refer to it as}} [...] "preserving the good name of The Wiggles", the group has stressed the importance of, and were protective of, their brand. [...] Field, along with bandmate Jeff Fatt and Field's brothers Paul and John, were in the pop band The Cockroaches in the 1980s; as Field reported, The Wiggles adopted many of The Cockroaches' business practices. [...] They chose to remain as independent and self-contained as possible. [...] The four original members retained ownership and creative control over every aspect of their business, and used outside companies to assist them as their business and popularity grew. [...] As Field reported, [...] "...Our venture developed organically. [...] We weren't put together in some sort of Hollywood studio executive's office". [...] They used Field's family members and friends in the early years: former Cockroaches such as Field's brothers and Cockroach drummer Tony Henry (Wiggles character Henry the Octopus was named after him) for musical support; Field's nieces and nephews to perform in their inexpensive videos; their girlfriends to perform as their costumed characters. [...] The wife of founding member Murray Cook made their first costumes. As Fatt reported, [...] "it was very much a cottage industry". They served as their own roadies and travelled in Fatt's van, which he drove, towing a trailer with borrowed equipment. [...] Fatt did their bookkeeping on an old computer the first five to six years of the group's existence. [...] They did their own merchandising, which consisted of selling albums, toys, and t-shirts out of a suitcase set <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of a trailer.|$|E
500|$|The {{older one}} sees White {{attack in the}} centre with moves like b2–b3, Bc1–b2, Qd1–d5, Nc3–e4 and c4–c5. White gets an {{important}} space advantage in the centre, but Black can attack the kingside with rook lifts. After 10.b3 a5 White can try to capture the Bc5 with 11.Na4 or 11.Ne4, one point being that the retreat 11...Ba7 would lock the Ra8 because Black has not played Ra8–a6 already. Lalic still thinks 11...Ba7 is the right move after 11.Ne4 due {{to the importance of}} the a7–g1 diagonal, but Black can also reroute the bishop with 11...Bf8 and [...] "White has no obvious path to even a minute advantage". After 11.Na4 Black can also simply react by 11...b6 when the loss of the bishop pair is compensated by the semi-open b-file and improved control of the central squares. Tseitlin considers that after the exchange on c5 Black has the better position. Hence the main continuation is 11.Bb2, keeping the knight jumps for later. Then the most common plan for Black is a rook lift: the plan Ra8–a6–h6 was tried in the much-commented game Åkesson–Tagnon (Berlin Open 1984). Black duly won, but after the game continuation 11...Ra6 12.Qd5! Qe7 13.Ne4 Ba7 14.c5 Rg6 15.Rac1 Bb8 16.f4 authors do not agree on which side had the advantage. Borik and Tseitlin both consider White to have a positional advantage, with Tseitlin recommending instead 15...Nc6!, with dangerous threats. However Lalic writes of 15...Bb8, [...] "it is true that the bishop pair looks a bit pathetic lined <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> rank just now, but {{there is no way to}} stop them breaking out later".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Father, {{soon after}} they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to jump <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of <b>the</b> two chairs and stand across them - {{which is one of}} his tricks. He looked at father, and didn't do it at once. Everything of father's had gone wrong that night, and he hadn't pleased the public at all. He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing, and had no {{compassion}} on him. Then he beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, [...] "Father, father! Pray don't hurt the creature who is so fond of you! O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!" [...] And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.' ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{other parts}} of the world the Airedale's tail is {{commonly}} docked within five days of birth, but this is not considered a breed standard custom. To show an Airedale in the United States, the official AKC standard states [...] "The root of the tail should be set well <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> It should be carried gaily but not curled over the back. It should be of good strength and substance and of fair length." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think that when you get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of your neck and so we realized that we needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained. They decided to postpone the album's release until June and then August to continue recording.|$|E

60|$|Hank was not {{the sort}} of man who makes {{universal}} appeal. Also, he was no ladies' man. He was long and lean and hard-bitten, and his supply of conventional small talk was practically non-existent.

60|$|Our return {{journey was}} an exaggerated {{repetition}} of our morning drive. Our low comedian produced hideous noises from the horn, and entered into contests of running wit with 'bus drivers--a decided mistake from {{his point of}} view, the score generally remaining with the 'bus driver.

60|$|His {{friends were}} men's men; {{he could not}} see them fitting into a scheme of life that {{involved}} the perpetual presence of a hostess. Hank Jardine, for instance. To Kirk, the great point about Hank was that he had been everywhere, seen everything, and was, when properly stimulated with tobacco and drink, a fountain of reminiscence. But he could not talk unless he had his coat off and his feet <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of a chair. No hostess could be expected to relish that.|$|E
60|$|She went <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> piazza {{and looked}} over toward the barn, which {{appeared}} to be closed, and around and about the house, but saw nothing of the young man. But she would wait; it was scarcely likely {{that he was at}} work in the fields by himself. He would probably appear soon, and, if possible, she wanted to speak to him before she saw any one else. She went into the house, and took a seat in the hall, where, through a narrow window {{by the side of the}} door, she had a good view of the garden and the grounds at the back, and could also command the front entrance of the house.|$|E

We approached it by degrees, and got, in due time, to the inn in the Whitechapel district, for which we were bound.

6000|$|She {{wasted no}} time {{thinking}} about it, but began to steal back {{the way she had}} come. Now, no one is lighter of foot than old Granny Fox, and no one knows better how to keep out of sight. From tree to tree she crawled, sometimes flat on her stomach, until at last she reached the foot of the hill where she had just had such a fright. There was nothing to be seen there, but {{up at the top of}} the hill she saw something that made a fierce, angry gleam come into her yellow eyes. Then she smiled grimly. [...] "The last laugh always is the best laugh, and this time I guess it is going to be mine," [...] she said to herself.

60|$|I {{went away}} quietly {{that day and}} left her undisturbed; and I {{remember}} perfectly that I took with me something of the wonder, and something too of the fear, with which a child naturally meets the wild things for the first time. That she should be so still and fearless before me was a perfect argument to a child that she had some hidden means of defense--the long bill, perhaps, or a hidden sting--with which it was not well to trifle. All that seems very strange and far away to me now; but it was real enough then to a very small boy, {{alone in the dark}} woods, who {{met for the first time}} a large bird with an enormously long bill and eyes 'way <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of her head where they plainly did not belong, a bird moreover that had no fear and seemed perfectly well able to take care of herself. So I went away softly and wondered about it.|$|E
