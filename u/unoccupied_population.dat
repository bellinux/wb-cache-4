40|$|A {{sprawling}} U. S. population {{continues to}} spread into {{the fringes of}} urban development placing both populations and property in areas that were once largely <b>unoccupied.</b> <b>Population</b> tallies, housing unit totals, and housing values for 1990 and 2000 are examined {{to determine the extent}} to which this growth has affected the tornado hazard in northeastern Illinois. The growing town of Plainfield, Ill., located southwest of Chicago, is examined to determine how vulnerability to a tornado impact has changed in the town since an F 5 tornado struck the community in 1990. The population and housing data indicate an increase of 8, 629 persons and 3, 058 housing units affected if the tornado were to have occurred in 2000 rather than 1990. Estimations of housing value affected by the Plainfield tornado indicate a 50 % increase in 2000 compared with 1990 values. In addition to studying the impacts on Plainfield, four other scenarios are examined in suburban Chicago counties using the 1990 Plainfield tornado as a model for a potentially devastating strike. The large increase in total values of homes affected for each scenario highlights the overall increase in wealth throughout the study area, specifically along the urban fringe of development. The physical vulnerability throughout the study area has increased with the rise in population, but the most socially vulnerable areas appear to remain in the older urban centers...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife Management, 1992 I {{studied the}} {{demography}} of California spotted owls(Strix occidentalis occidentalis) {{in the central}} Sierra Nevada, California between 1986 and 1989. Fifty-five spotted owls were banded during the study. Estimates of fecundity, nest success, and productivity were 0. 34, 42. 0 %, and 1. 70, respectively. Of thirty-nine territories monitored, on average 55 % and 21 % were occupied by pairs or single owls, respectively, while 24 % were <b>unoccupied.</b> <b>Population</b> size was estimated empirically, from Jolly-Seber models A and D, and from Leslie regression analysis. The population estimates were 36, 33, 32, and 40 birds, respectively. All estimates were statistically the same. Goodness of fit tests indicated that the data from this study satisfied the assumptions of the Jolly-Seber models. Crude density was 0. 09 owls/km 2 and was significantly less than that reported for the northern spotted owl. Standard Lotka-Leslie models {{were used to assess}} the sensitivity of A to variation in the vital rates and to project population trends. Parameters estimated were adult survival rate (S) = 0. 76, juvenile survival rate (S 0) = 0. 16, and fecundity = 0. 34. The empirical estimate for adult survival was not significantly different from the Jolly-Seber model A estimate. The population's finite rate of growth, ??, was most sensitive to adult survival rate and age of senescence. Fecundity, subadult, and juvenile survival rate did not dramatically influence estimates of A. The value of A for this population was 0. 811, which was significantly less than 1. 0. At this rate of decline the population's half life is 4 years...|$|E

50|$|A metapopulation {{generally}} {{consists of}} several distinct populations together with areas of suitable habitat which are currently <b>unoccupied.</b> Each <b>population</b> cycles in relative {{independence of the}} other populations and eventually goes extinct {{as a consequence of}} demographic stochasticity (fluctuations in population size due to random demographic events); the smaller the population, the more prone it is to extinction.|$|R

40|$|A meta{{population}} is {{a population}} which can occupy regions, or ‘patches’, which are separated geographically. Each patch {{at any given}} time can be either occupied or <b>unoccupied</b> by the <b>population.</b> If a patch is empty, it may be colonized by the inhabitants of one (or several) of the other patches through a migration process. So patches in a metapopulation may undergo several local extinctions or recolonizations over time. It is also possible that all patches may become extinct. We may model these dynamics using a Markov chain, as we do in this investigation. First a simple discrete time model is investigated. We adjust this model to create a more realistic model. Several models used by other researchers are also examined. We then look at a continuous time model. Much modelling for metapopulations is done using discrete time Markov chains. However, using continuous time Markov chains can at times be simpler, as we shall see. When applied to a real metapopulation, the models investigated should have the parameters of the model estimated through study of the particular metapopulation. Regrettably, no data was used to estimate parameters i...|$|R
