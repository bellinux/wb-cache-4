5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent {{cannot be used}} directly for aqueous solutions.

For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for <b>use</b> <b>with</b> aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E

5|$|After the {{municipal}} merger between Oslo and Aker in 1948, Akersbanerne was merged into Oslo Sporveier, although Holmenkolbanen remained a partially owned subsidiary. In 1973, Oslo Sporveier bought the remaining shares, {{and two years}} later the operations were transferred to Oslo Sporveier, with Holmenkolbanen remaining a pure real estate company. The municipal take-over resulted in an upgrade to both the track and the rolling stock. New overhead wires and new and heavier track were laid. From 1978, the T1300 trains were taken into <b>use.</b> <b>With</b> the take-over, the lines were numbered, and the Sognsvann Line designated 81, although this was quickly changed to 13.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant <b>use</b> <b>with</b> CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E
