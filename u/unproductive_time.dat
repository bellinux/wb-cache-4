The study is intended to enable greater productivity in production by studying waste. The study is rooted in the Japanese production theory, Lean production, which aims to reduce all non-value-added operations. The study focuses on the improvements that can be made in the process of loading the cars. The study objective was to locate unproductive sequences and measure these, study the time required for the tally process and to discuss applicable tools within Lean on the loading process. The methodology for the report has been to study the theory of Lean production and all process-enhancing tools that the theory concludes. Information on how the terminal operates in conjunction with a loading sequence and the dividing of the car-crews are explained in the report. The workflow is described and then studied along with the loading procedure, where the main factors that contributed to the <b>unproductive</b> <b>time</b> were located. Measurements were executed on the time it takes for the cars to be stowed onboard and the time of the tally procedure.

The results of the measurements clearly showed that the parking time contributes to <b>unproductive</b> <b>time,</b> and that there are measures that can improve production efficiency.

40|$|AbstractAccording to a {{range of}} assessments, there exists a large {{cost-effective}} potential to increase energy efficiency in shipping through reduced speed at sea enabled by shorter time in port. This means that the energy needed can be reduced whilst maintaining the same transport service. However, the fact that a large cost-effective potential has been identified that is not being harnessed by decision-makers in practice suggests that there is more to this potential to understand. In this paper, the possibilities for increasing energy efficiency by reducing waiting time in port are explored and problematised through a case study of a short sea bulk shipping company transporting dry bulk goods mainly in the North and Baltic seas. Operational data from two ships in the company’s fleet for one year showed that the ships spent more than 40 % of their time in ports and that half of the time in port was not productive. The two most important reasons for the large share of <b>unproductive</b> <b>time</b> were that ports were closed on nights and weekends and that ships arrived too early before the stevedores were ready to load or unload the cargo. Reducing all of the <b>unproductive</b> <b>time</b> may be difficult, but the results also show that even a conservative estimate of one to four hours of reduced time per port call would lead to a reduction in energy use of 2 – 8 %. From in-depth interviews with employees of the shipping company, ports and ship agencies, a complex picture is painted when attempting to understand how this potential arises. Aspects such as a lack of effective ship-shore-port communication, little time for ship operators, an absence of means for accurately predicting energy use of voyages as a function of speed, perceived risk of arriving too late, and relationships with third-party technical management may all play a role...|$|E

40|$|This paper, focused {{primarily}} on UK data and debates, considers the potential significance of travel time use within past, present and future patterns of mobility. In transport scheme appraisal, savings in travel time typically represent a substantial proportion {{of the benefits of}} a scheme [...] benefits used to justify its often enormous financial costs. Such benefits are founded on the assumption that travel <b>time</b> is <b>unproductive,</b> wasted <b>time</b> in-between 'real' activities and which should be minimised. Travel demand analysis treats travel time and activity time as separate, albeit acknowledging an interdependency. The paper challenges these approaches by exploring how travel time can be, and is, being used 'productively' as activity time, and what enhancements to time use might be emerging in the 'information age'. Such undermining of the division between activities and travelling, and between activity time and travel time, may have major implications for future levels of mobility, for the modal distribution of travel, for the validity of current transport appraisal methodology and for the analysis of travelling within the information age.
