5|$|After {{the success}} of Mayabazar (1957), {{directed}} by Kadiri Venkata Reddy, B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani of Vijaya Vauhini Studios planned to make a contemporary drama. Chakrapani came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> idea about conflict between two older men who are polar opposites: one a debtor evading his creditors, {{and the other a}} wealthy gentleman with an inflated sense of prestige. L. V. Prasad was chosen to direct the film; he, Chakrapani and Vempati Sadasivabrahmam developed a script entitled Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu, after a popular Telugu idiom. It was the only film from Vijaya Vauhini Studios with dialogue written by Sadasivabrahmam.|$|E
5|$|During exploration, {{the player}} enters battle through both story-based boss battles and random {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Combat is turn-based, with enemies facing against a four-member party {{made up of}} the protagonist and three chosen demons. Combat is governed by a derivative of the Press Turn system used in : in Strange Journey, the relevant system is called the Demon Co-op System. If the player group strikes their opponent's weak point, any allied demon of the attacker's aliment will follow <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unblockable attack which deals high damage.|$|E
5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing. It was completely run-down with trash on the streets, and total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> education system that told you point blank that if you came from {{the wrong side of}} the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us.|$|E

50|$|Result: A.S.A.P came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> story {{revolving}} around La Toya Jackson about a lion who couldn't roar. Backbone came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> story based on Lil Jon about him becoming a superhero.|$|R

5|$|Hand {{followed}} this <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{address to the}} Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York the next year. Once again, his attack on McCarthyism won approval from many liberals. Asked to send {{a copy of his}} views to McCarthy, Hand replied that he had Richard Nixon in mind as well. Despite his concerns about Nixon as vice president, Hand voted for Dwight Eisenhower in the 1952 election, later crediting Eisenhower with bringing about McCarthy's downfall in 1954.|$|E

Before her career in wrestling began, Kanellis regularly competed in beauty pageants.|$|E
5|$|Luscombe Castle is {{a country}} house {{situated}} near the resort town of Dawlish, in the county of Devon in England. Upon purchasing the land at Luscombe in 1797, Charles Hoare demolished the existing house and commissioned architects John Nash and Humphrey Repton to design a new house and gardens at the site. Nash and Repton came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> asymmetrical designed building made from Portland stone, with castellated parapets, turrets and pinnacles to create {{the feel of a}} picturesque castle.|$|E

5|$|Mosley came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{innovative}} way {{to dispose}} of the FIA's involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One. In order to maintain Ecclestone's investment to deliver digital television, he proposed extending Ecclestone's rights for F1 coverage to 100 years from the initial 15, arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti-competition as it was effectively the same as an outright sale. The Commission agreed with his assessment and in the interest of impartiality, Mosley removed himself from the negotiations, which eventually returned around $300 million (£150 million).|$|E
5|$|Nuaym {{then came}} <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{efficient}} stratagem. He {{first went to}} the Banu Qurayza and warned them about {{the intentions of the}} rest of the Confederacy. If the siege fails, he said, the Confederacy will not be afraid to abandon the Jews, leaving them at the mercy of Muhammad. The Qurayza should thus demand Confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation. This advice touched upon the fears the Qurayza had already harboured.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March 1918, the Germans {{began their}} Spring Offensive and the New Zealand Division {{was rushed to}} plug {{a gap in the}} front near Colincamps. On 27 March, Puttick was wounded in the chest while leading his {{battalion}} in an action designed to link <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Australian brigade in the nearby village of Hébuterne. He was evacuated to England for treatment and after recuperating, commanded the New Zealand Rifle Brigade's training camp in Brocton, Staffordshire. However, his wounds were such that he was eventually repatriated to New Zealand {{at the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|The UERL was set <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> initial {{capitalisation}} of £5million (£ today). The {{company was}} backed by three merchant banks, Speyer Brothers in London, Speyer & Co. in New York and Old Colony Trust Company in Boston, each of which was to receive £250,000 from the capital raised. Almost 60 per cent of the initial share offering was bought in the United States, with a third sold in Britain and the rest mainly in the Netherlands. Further capital was soon needed for the construction works and additional share and bond issues followed. The UERL eventually raised a total of £18million (£ today).|$|E
5|$|The game's budget {{exceeded}} expectations. The original 15-person development team {{expanded to}} about 100, {{at a cost}} of 20 million złoty. According to Iwiński, content was removed from the game for budgetary reasons but the characters' personalities were retained; however, there was difficulty in translating the game's Polish text into English. Atari agreed to publish the game. After five years of development, The game would bring Wiedźmin to an international audience, and so the company came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> English name: The Witcher. The Witcher was released in 2007 to generally positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|The {{helicopter}} {{operations were}} {{taken over by}} Norsk Helikpoter (later renamed Bristow Norway) when they opened their base on 11 November 2004. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Hammerfest was the second airport to receive SCAT-I, a Global Positioning System-based landing system, when it was installed in 2007. SCAT-I allows aircraft with the system installed to make a safer and less fuel-consuming landings using a gliding instead of step-down approach. This was followed <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> upgrade to the runway safety area and runway lights in 2008 and 2009.|$|E

5|$|The plot {{key to the}} {{eventual}} rescue plan undertaken is that a lone JPL astrodynamicist suddenly comes <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> out-of-nowhere idea about using gravity assist to get astronauts back to Mars faster and then has to convince layers of NASA management that this could work. In reality, gravity assist is a well-known practice {{that has been used}} on a number of unmanned planetary exploration missions and served as a backup strategy on manned Apollo missions. It would {{have been one of the}} first approaches that everyone within NASA would have considered.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Candace {{mentions}} that {{her best friend}} Stacy Hirano had become the president of Uruguay was originally written as a throwaway joke for the episode. During an e-mail exchange between the crew, some crew members were curious about the line and Povenmire came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> entire back story, in which Stacy meets the prince of the country, moves there and, after changing several laws, becomes eligible for the presidency. The staff enjoyed the idea and wrote it down as a possible plot for a future episode.|$|E
5|$|They {{visited the}} Trianon gardens again on several occasions, but {{were unable to}} trace the path they took. Various landmarks, such as the kiosk and the bridge, were missing, and the grounds were full of people. Trying to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> explanation, they {{wondered}} if they had stumbled across a private party or an event booked that day. However, they found that nothing had been booked that afternoon. During their research, they thought they recognised the man by the kiosk as the Comte de Vaudreuil, a friend of Marie Antoinette, who herself had been {{thought to have been}} seen by Moberly.|$|E

5|$|When Kukunoor was {{thinking}} of a character full of disguises, he first came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> old man. When {{the thought of a}} scene with the three major characters dancing in the dunes came up, he realized that an older character could not realistically dance in the desert. He immediately felt that Shreyas Talpade, whom he knew of knowing mimicry, could be used for bahuroopiya. Kukunoor, who worked previously with Girish Karnad, said that he was the strength for the film and added that he found him a good actor and a good human being.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Pedro de Alvarado entered Chiapas when {{he crossed}} {{a part of}} the Lacandon Forest in an attempt to link <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{expedition}} headed by Hernán Cortés, that crossed from the Gulf of Mexico to Honduras. Alvarado entered Chiapas from Guatemala via the territory of the Acala Ch'ol; he was unable to locate Cortés, and his scouts eventually led him to Tecpan Puyumatlan (modern Santa Eulalia in Guatemala), in a mountainous region near the territory of the Lakandon Ch'ol. The inhabitants of Tecpan Puyumatlan offered fierce resistance against the Spanish-led expedition, and Gonzalo de Alvarado wrote that the Spanish suffered many losses, including the killing of messengers sent to summon the natives to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After failing to locate Cortés, the Alvarados returned to Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Anthony Dominick Benedetto {{was born}} on August 3, 1926, in Astoria, Queens, New York, to grocer John Benedetto and {{seamstress}} Anna Suraci. In 1906, John had emigrated from Podàrgoni, a rural eastern district of the southern Italian city of Reggio Calabria. Anna {{had been born in}} the U.S. shortly after her parents also emigrated from the Calabria region in 1899. Other relatives came over as well as part of the mass migration of Italians to America. Tony grew <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> older sister, Mary, and an older brother, John Jr. With a father who was ailing and unable to work, the children grew up in poverty. John Sr. instilled in his son a love of art and literature and a compassion for human suffering, but died when Tony was 10 years old. The experience of growing up in the Great Depression and a distaste for the effects of the Hoover Administration would make the child a lifelong Democrat.|$|E
