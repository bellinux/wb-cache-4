2500|$|The <b>ultraproduct</b> {{construction}} in model theory uses ultrafilters to produce elementary extensions of structures. For example, in constructing hyperreal numbers as an <b>ultraproduct</b> {{of the real}} numbers, the domain of discourse is extended from real numbers to sequences of real numbers. This sequence space {{is regarded as a}} superset of the reals by identifying each real with the corresponding constant sequence. To extend the familiar functions and relations (e.g., + and <) from the reals to the hyperreals, the natural idea is to define them pointwise. But this would lose important logical properties of the reals; for example, pointwise < is not a total ordering. So instead the functions and relations are defined [...] "pointwise modulo U", where U is an ultrafilter on the index set of the sequences; by Łoś' theorem, this preserves all properties of the reals that can be stated in first-order logic. If U is nonprincipal, then the extension thereby obtained is nontrivial.|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} some recent {{applications}} of <b>ultraproducts</b> in algebra, they remain largely unknown to commutative algebraists, {{in part because}} they do not preserve basic properties such as Noetherianity. This work wants to make a strong case against these prejudices. More precisely, it studies <b>ultraproducts</b> of Noetherian local rings from a purely algebraic perspective, as well as how they can be used to transfer results between the positive and zero characteristics, to derive uniform bounds, to define tight closure in characteristic zero, and to prove asymptotic versions of homological conjectures in mixed characteristic. Some of these results are obtained using variants called chromatic products, which are often even Noetherian. This book, neither assuming nor using any logical formalism, is intended for algebraists and geometers, in the hope of popularizing <b>ultraproducts</b> and their applications in algebra...|$|R

40|$|We {{define a}} class of groups {{equipped}} with an invariant probability measure, which includes all compact groups and is closed under taking <b>ultraproducts</b> with the induced Loeb measure. We call these probability groups and develop the basics {{of the theory of}} their measure-preserving actions on probability spaces, including a natural notion of mixing. A short proof reveals that for probability groups mixing implies double recurrence, which generalizes a theorem of Bergelson and Tao proved for <b>ultraproducts</b> of finite groups. Moreover, a quantitative version of our proof gives that ϵ-approximate mixing implies 3 √(ϵ) -approximate double recurrence. Examples of approximately mixing probability groups are quasirandom groups introduced by Gowers, so the last theorem generalizes and sharpens the corresponding results for quasirandom groups of Bergelson and Tao, as well as of Austin.

40|$|Abstract. We generalise the <b>ultraproducts</b> method from {{conventional}} model theory to an institutionindependent (i. e. {{independent of the}} details of the actual logic formalised as an institution) framework based on a novel very general treatment of the semantics of some important concepts in logic, model theoretic approaches to <b>ultraproducts</b> based on category theory, our work makes essential use of concepts central to institution theory, such as signature morphisms and model reducts. The institution-independent fundamental theorem on <b>ultraproducts</b> is presented in a modular manner, different combinations of its various parts giving different results in different logics or institutions. We present applications to institution-independent compactness, axiomatizability, and higher order sentences, and illustrate our concepts and results with examples from four different algebraic specification logics. In the introduction we also discuss the relevance of our institution-independent approach to the model theory of algebraic specification and computing science, but also to classical and abstract model theory...|$|R
