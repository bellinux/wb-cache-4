5|$|A {{short period}} of glacial {{conditions}} returned between 12,650 and 11,550 years BP, known in Britain as the Loch Lomond Stadial (and elsewhere as the Younger Dryas stadial), when the Gulf Stream current ceased to flow past the British Isles. Small cirque and valley glaciers formed in north and east facing valleys, including Grisedale and the coves {{on the east side}} of Helvellyn. The results are seen in moraines of <b>unsorted</b> boulder gravel in the valleys, the spectacular coves with steep headwalls, and the sharp arêtes formed where the rock was eroded on both sides between adjacent glaciers.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about its {{reproduction}} or nuptial flight. Collectors note that no alates or pupae resembling alate forms were found in excavated colonies between August and February, and the larvae collected were not {{large enough to be}} reproductive ants. However, it is possible that nuptial flight takes place in spring or summer, and like N. albisetosus and N.cockerelli, alates most likely start to occur by June. After nuptial flight, queens search for a suitable colony by building a chamber under objects such as stones and exposed roots of woody plants. This theory stated by entomologist Paul Kannowski is supported by the fact that these ants depend on stones buried in the soil for nest construction. The larvae and pupae are <b>unsorted</b> in the upper chambers of the nest that are joined together by hooked hairs {{on the side of the}} larvae. This arrangement most likely helps workers move the brood efficiently and keep them together in a group. Incipient colonies may only have 30 workers and brood in all life stages. Unlike the larvae and pupae, the eggs and queen are not found in the uppermost galleries, but rather they are found in the deepest chambers of the nest. In large nests, small workers resembling the first generation of brood are either rare or absent.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} science, heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort can {{be thought}} of as an improved selection sort: like that algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an <b>unsorted</b> region, and it iteratively shrinks the <b>unsorted</b> region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. The improvement consists of the use of a heap data structure rather than a linear-time search to find the maximum.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{the sort}} works {{from right to}} left (the {{opposite}} direction), which is more appropriate for partially sorted lists, or lists with <b>unsorted</b> items added to the end.|$|E
25|$|Beneath {{the surface}} layer of <b>unsorted</b> glacial till are strata of {{sandstone}} and ironstone which weathering and erosion have exposed {{above the surface}} in areas. Deposits of coal are found east of Larbert.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unsorted</b> {{glacial till}} {{gives rise to}} such {{features}} of glacial deposition as eskers, and drumlins which are predominant {{over much of the}} area. Such elements provide natural transport routes and it is this complex underlying geology that the town is built upon.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the actions}} are much wider since waste {{treatment}} also enters {{the competence of}} the community. The waste disposal site of the commune lies in the ZAE du Causse d'Auge, north of the city. In this context, <b>unsorted</b> collection is also {{the responsibility of the}} community of communes.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{evidence}} now {{shows that}} a number of periods of growth and retreat of continental glaciers occurred during the ice age, called glacials and interglacials. The interglacial periods of warm climate are represented by buried soil profiles, peat beds, and lake and stream deposits separating the <b>unsorted,</b> unstratified deposits of glacial debris.|$|E
25|$|Retreating glaciers {{leave behind}} silt, clay, sand, gravel, and {{boulders}} called drift. Glacial drift includes <b>unsorted</b> material called till and layers deposited by meltwater streams called outwash While drift from early (pre-Illinoian) glaciations {{has been found}} {{in some parts of the}} region, much of the incised Paleozoic Plateau of Wisconsin and northwestern Illinois holds no evidence for glaciation.|$|E
25|$|Fibonacci {{numbers are}} used in a {{polyphase}} version of the merge sort algorithm in which an <b>unsorted</b> list {{is divided into two}} lists whose lengths correspond to sequential Fibonacci numbers– by dividing the list so that the two parts have lengths in the approximate proportion φ. A tape-drive implementation of the polyphase merge sort was described in The Art of Computer Programming.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} itself {{contains more}} than 197,000 cataloged lots {{of which there are}} 2,150,000 specimens, representing more than 7,000 species. In addition, there is an <b>unsorted</b> backlog of about 25,000 lots, about 250,000 specimens. Most of the uncatalogued and backlog material was acquired through transfer of the important collections previously housed at the National Marine Fisheries Service biological laboratories in Miami, Pascagoula, MS, and the University of Miami. The collection currently contains primary and secondary types of more than 325 taxa of freshwater and marine fishes.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} involves {{solving a}} difficult problem by transforming {{it into a}} better known problem for which we have (hopefully) asymptotically optimal algorithms. The goal {{is to find a}} reducing algorithm whose complexity is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithm's. For example, one selection algorithm for finding the median in an <b>unsorted</b> list involves first sorting the list (the expensive portion) and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion). This technique is also known as transform and conquer.|$|E
25|$|Insertion sort is {{very similar}} to {{selection}} sort. As in selection sort, after k passes through the array, the first k elements are in sorted order. For selection sort these are the k smallest elements, while in insertion sort they are whatever the first k elements were in the <b>unsorted</b> array. Insertion sort's advantage is that it only scans as many elements as needed to determine the correct location of the k+1st element, while selection sort must scan all remaining elements to find the absolute smallest element.|$|E
25|$|Bradgate Park and its {{surrounding}} areas were heavily overlain in the (geologically) recent past by glacial deposits of Boulder Clay. The Quaternary period includes the last ice age. As the ice melted, some 10,000 years ago, the solid material within the ice settled over the 'natural' rocks below. This material includes <b>unsorted</b> clay and sand particles, small and large pebbles and large stones and boulders. It travelled great distances within the ice sheets and glaciers, so individual rocks, whether on the ground, or within the great lengths of stone walls of the Park, may be local stone, or may be a specimen from northern Britain or even from northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} caveat about quicksort is {{that its}} worst-case performance is O(n2); while this is rare, in naive implementations (choosing the first or last element as pivot) this occurs for sorted data, which is a common case. The most complex issue in quicksort is thus choosing a good pivot element, as consistently poor choices of pivots can result in drastically slower O(n2) performance, but good choice of pivots yields O(n log n) performance, which is asymptotically optimal. For example, if at each step the median is chosen as the pivot then the algorithm works in O(nlogn). Finding the median, such as by the median of medians selection algorithm is however an O(n) operation on <b>unsorted</b> lists and therefore exacts significant overhead with sorting. In practice choosing a random pivot almost certainly yields O(nlogn) performance.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a gender}} {{division}} of labor {{in the process of}} collecting and sorting the trash in the Zabbaleen system. Usually, it is the Zabbaleen men, sometimes accompanied by children, who go pick up the trash door-to-door from each household. This trash is completely <b>unsorted</b> because there is not a system of recycling at the source in Egypt. It is rare for girls to go to collect the trash and it stops almost entirely after girls reach the age 10. The means of transportation that the Zabbaleen use to transport the trash that they collect are donkey-pulled carts and pickup trucks. After the Zabbaleen pick up the trash, they take the trash back to their village, a trip that may take anywhere from between 10 minutes to an hour.|$|E
25|$|In Principles of Geology (first edition, vol. 3, Ch. 2, 1833) Lyell {{proposed}} that icebergs {{could be the}} means of transport for erratics. During periods of global warming, ice breaks off the poles and floats across submerged continents, carrying debris with it, he conjectured. When the iceberg melts, it rains down sediments upon the land. Because this theory could account for the presence of diluvium, the word drift became the preferred term for the loose, <b>unsorted</b> material, today called till. Furthermore, Lyell believed that the accumulation of fine angular particles covering much of the world (today called loess) was a deposit settled from mountain flood water. Today some of Lyell's mechanisms for geological processes have been disproven, though many have stood the test of time. His observational methods and general analytical framework remain in use today as foundational principles in geology.|$|E
25|$|The {{quicksort}} algorithm {{was developed}} in 1959 by Tony Hoare while in the Soviet Union, as a visiting student at Moscow State University. At that time, Hoare worked in a project on machine translation for the National Physical Laboratory. As {{a part of the}} translation process, he needed to sort the words of Russian sentences prior to looking them up in a Russian-English dictionary that was already sorted in alphabetic order on magnetic tape. After recognizing that his first idea, insertion sort, would be slow, he quickly came up with a new idea that was Quicksort. He wrote a program in Mercury Autocode for the partition but couldn't write the program to account for the list of <b>unsorted</b> segments. On return to England, he was asked to write code for Shellsort as part of his new job. Hoare mentioned to his boss that he knew of a faster algorithm and his boss bet sixpence that he didn't. His boss ultimately accepted that he had lost the bet. Later, Hoare learned about ALGOL and its ability to do recursion that enabled him to publish the code in Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery, the premier computer science journal of the time.|$|E

Similarly, the merge sort algorithm sorts an <b>unsorted</b> list by dividing the list into halves and sorting these first before merging the results.

500|$|Waterloo {{was bombed}} {{several times during}} World War II. On 7 September 1940, the John Street viaduct {{immediately}} outside the station was destroyed by a bomb, which prevented any services running for 12 days. Full services did not resume until 1 October, which particularly affected mail traffic with over 5,000 <b>unsorted</b> bags piling up on the station platform. Waterloo was closed again after bombing on 29 December 1940. It re-opened on 5 January 1941, {{on the same day}} that station offices on York Road were destroyed by bombing. The station took heavy damage again after an overnight raid on 10–11 May 1941, with fires lasting for four days. One [...] bomb was not discovered until it was uncovered during building work along York Road in 1959.|$|E
500|$|However, the single-linkage {{clustering}} can {{be found}} more efficiently by an alternative algorithm that computes the minimum spanning tree of the input distances using Prim's algorithm, and then sorts the minimum spanning tree edges and uses this sorted list to guide the merger of pairs of clusters.

This choice saves {{the time that the}} algorithm would otherwise spend adjusting the weights of vertices in its priority queue. Using Prim's algorithm in this way would take time [...] and space , matching the best bounds that could be achieved with the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm for distances with constant-time calculations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{underlying}} geology of Larbert {{is primarily}} characterised by glacial deposits. Elevations above [...] {{are covered by}} a mixture of glacial till and boulder clay with low-lying areas covered by sandy soils and loams.

2500|$|In {{recognition}} of their lasting national importance, Douglas' papers had been deposited with {{the archives of the}} Manx National Heritage Library at her death. These were an <b>unsorted</b> and uncatalogued collection of [...] "everything from bank statements and bills to original manuscripts and unpublished works," [...] until Autumn 2003 when a Manx Heritage Foundation grant enabled Dr Breesha Maddrell [...] "to sift through them, collate them and then make a detailed assessment of their value and content." ...|$|E
2500|$|These two {{mountains}} are underlain primarily with late Cretaceous dark greenish-gray graywacke, a poorly sorted sandstone containing angular rock fragments, about ten percent feldspar and detrital chert. [...] The angular <b>unsorted</b> content implies a rapid erosion and burial in a depositional basin, with {{an outcome of}} few fossils. [...] Exposed graywacke can be observed on high ridges and on the steep canyon walls. [...] Radiolarian chert is exposed on certain south facing slopes of San Bruno Mountain and at Point San Bruno.|$|E
2500|$|Assuming the k+1st element's rank is random, {{insertion}} sort will on average require shifting {{half of the}} previous k elements, while selection sort always requires scanning all unplaced elements. So for <b>unsorted</b> input, {{insertion sort}} will usually perform about half as many comparisons as selection sort. If the input array is reverse-sorted, insertion sort performs as many comparisons as selection sort. If the input array is already sorted, insertion sort performs as few as n-1 comparisons, thus making insertion sort more efficient when given sorted or [...] "nearly sorted" [...] arrays.|$|E
2500|$|A {{more distant}} goal is the {{development}} of quantum computers, which are expected to perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical computers. Instead of using classical bits, quantum computers use qubits, which can be in superpositions of states. Quantum programmers are able to [...] manipulate the superposition of qubits in order to solve problems that classical computing cannot do effectively, such as searching <b>unsorted</b> databases or integer factorization. IBM claims that the advent of quantum computing may progress the fields of medicine, logistics, financial services, artificial intelligence and cloud security.|$|E

2500|$|While the {{machinery}} of the Centuriate Assembly continued to exist well {{into the life of}} the empire, the assembly lost all of its practical relevance. Under the empire, all gatherings of the Centuriate Assembly were {{in the form of an}} <b>unsorted</b> convention. Legislation was never submitted to the imperial Centuriate Assembly, and the one major legislative power that this assembly had held under the republic, the right to declare war, was now delegated to the emperor through his greater proconsular authority. All judicial powers that had been held by the republican Centuriate Assembly were transferred to independent jury courts, and under the emperor Tiberius, all of its former electoral powers were transferred to the senate. After it had lost all of these powers, it had no remaining authority. Its only remaining function was, after the senate had 'elected' the magistrates, to hear the renuntiatio, The renuntiatio had no legal purpose, but instead was a ceremony in which the results of the election were read to the electors. This allowed the emperor to claim that the magistrates had been [...] "elected" [...] by a sovereign people.|$|E
2500|$|After {{years of}} heavy {{drinking}} (including consumption of absinthe), Satie died on 1 July 1925 from cirrhosis of the liver. He {{is buried in}} the cemetery in Arcueil. There is a tiny stone monument designating a grassy area {{in front of an}} apartment building – 'Parc Erik Satie'. Over the course of his 27 years in residence at Arcueil, where Satie lived in stark simplicity, no one had ever visited his room. After his death, Satie's friends discovered an apartment replete with squalor and chaos. Among many other <b>unsorted</b> papers and miscellaneous items, it contained a large number of umbrellas, and two grand pianos placed {{one on top of the}} other, the upper instrument used as storage for letters and parcels. They discovered compositions that were either thought to have been lost or totally unknown. The score to Jack in the Box was thought, by Satie, to have been left on a bus years before. These were found behind the piano, in the pockets of his velvet suits, and in other odd places, and included Vexations; Geneviève de Brabant and other unpublished or unfinished stage works; The Dreamy Fish; many Schola Cantorum exercises; a previously unseen set of [...] "canine" [...] piano pieces; and several other works for piano, many untitled.

60|$|I {{think that}} I {{did not try}} to see Cambridge the same day that I saw Lowell, but wisely came back to my hotel in Boston, and tried to realize the fact. I went out another day, with an {{acquaintance}} from Ohio; whom I ran upon in the street. We went to Mount Auburn together, and I viewed its monuments with a reverence which I dare say their artistic quality did not merit. But I am, not sorry for this, for perhaps they are not quite so bad as some people pretend. The Gothic chapel of the cemetery, <b>unsorted</b> as it was, gave me, with its half-dozen statues standing or sitting about, an emotion such as I am afraid I could not receive now from the Acropolis, Westminster Abbey, and Santa Crocea in one. I tried hard for some aesthetic sense of it, and I made believe that I thought this thing and that thing in the place moved me with its fitness or beauty; {{but the truth is that}} I had no taste in anything but literature, and did not feel the effect I would so willingly have experienced.|$|E
60|$|As {{the evening}} of the 24th drew on apace, and the {{ordinary}} pressure of the evening mail began {{to be added to the}} extraordinary pressure of the day, the real tug of war began! The demand for extra service throughout the country began to exercise a reflex influence on the great centre. Mails came from the country in some instances with the letters <b>unsorted,</b> thus increasing the difficulties of the situation. The struggle was all the more severe that preparations for the night despatch were begun with a jaded force, some of the men having already been twenty-six and twenty-eight hours at work. Moreover, frost and fog prevailed at the time, and that not only delayed trains and the arrival of mails, but penetrated the building so that the labour was performed in a depressing atmosphere. To meet the emergency, at least in part, the despatch of the usual eight o'clock mail was delayed for that night fifty minutes. As in actual war an hour's delay may be fraught with tremendous issues for good or ill, so this brief postal delay permitted the despatch of an enormous amount of correspondence that would have otherwise been left over to the following day.|$|E

But alas, while there is no intelligible human image, nothing of lineaments or organic sequences, or other than a jumbled mass of Historical Marine-Stores, presided over by Dryasdust and Human Stupor (<b>unsorted,</b> unlabelled, tied up in blind sacks), the very Antiquary will have uphill work of it, and his readers will often turn round on him with a gloomy expression of countenance!" ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this is very}} consoling {{from the}} alien's point of view. He perceives, with great comfort, that out of strain is bred impatience {{in the shape of}} a young bundle of nerves, who is about as undisciplined an imp as the earth can show. Out of impatience, grown up, habituated to violent and ugly talk, and the impatience and {{recklessness}} of his neighbours, is begotten lawlessness, encouraged by laziness and suppressed by violence when it becomes insupportable. Out of lawlessness is bred rebellion (and that fruit has been tasted once already), and out of rebellion comes profit to those who wait. He hears of the power of the People who, through rank slovenliness, neglect to see that their laws are soberly enforced from the beginning; and these People, not once or twice in a year, but many times within a month, go out in the open streets and, with a maximum waste of power and shouting, strangle other people with ropes. They are, he is told, law-abiding citizens who have executed 'the will of the people'; which is as though a man should leave his papers <b>unsorted</b> for a year and then smash his desk with an axe, crying, 'Am I not orderly?' He hears lawyers, otherwise sane and matured, defend this pig-jobbing murder on the grounds that 'the People stand behind the Law'--the law that they never administered. He sees a right, at present only half--but still half--conceded to anticipate the law in one's own interests; and nervous impatience (always nerves) forejudging the suspect in gaol, the prisoner in the dock, and the award between nation and nation ere it is declared. He knows that the maxim in London, Yokohama, and Hongkong in doing business with the pure-bred American is to keep him waiting, for the reason that forced inaction frets the man to a lather, as standing in harness frets a half-broken horse. He comes across a thousand little peculiarities of speech, manner, and thought--matters of nerve and stomach developed by everlasting friction--and they are all just the least little bit in the world lawless. No more so than the restless clicking together of horns in a herd of restless cattle, but certainly no less. They are all good--good for those who wait.|$|E
