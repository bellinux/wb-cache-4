40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} new approach to designing frequency-selective surfaces having extensive applications in communications and radar systems. Unlike conventional surfaces composed of resonance-length elements, the new structures use sub-wavelength elements, and therefore, operate in TEM mode. Consequently, their frequency response is harmonic-free up to a frequency where their elements' dimensions become comparable with the wavelength. Hence, their behavior is described through quasi-static circuit models. These surfaces, which will be referred to as miniaturized-element surfaces, are easily synthesized since filter theory and circuit simulators are utilized in their design process. The small dimensions of the elements of the surface and its TEM mode of operation decrease the surface sensitivity to the incidence angle of the excitation (plane-wave). This allows the application of such surfaces in conjunction with phased-arrays and their placement in close proximity to an antenna. These surfaces can also operate properly with smaller panel dimensions. The theory of the new surfaces is introduced in Chapter 3 where a surface consisting of an array of wavelength/ 12 -long elements is presented. The transmission response of this surface includes a passband and a transmission zero. For this design, the first harmonic is located at a frequency six times higher than the operation frequency. <b>Using</b> <b>varactors,</b> frequency tuning of nearly an octave is shown. Chapter 4 presents multipole spatial filters. Through an accurate circuit model, dual-bandpass and maximally flat filters that are wavelength/ 240 thick are demonstrated. Chapter 5 introduces a reconfigurable surface that produces a frequency response with two operation modes: bandstop and bandpass. Moreover, <b>using</b> <b>varactors,</b> the center frequency and the bandwidth are tuned independently. The discussion on tunability is continued in Chapter 6 which introduces another varactor-tuned structure that operates, similar to the previous designs, without additional biasing circuitry for the varactors. However, this structure is immune to single point failure as it uses a parallel biasing method. Finally, Chapter 7 demonstrates a wavelength/ 10 -thick, coupled filter-antenna array to achieve a high-order filtering for beamforming arrays. This design eliminates the need for integrating bulky filters required in the receive chain of array elements...|$|E
30|$|Recently, a novel {{parasitic}} array architecture {{has been}} developed [21 – 23], which can significantly decrease the size and cost of arrays, thus making their integration in handheld terminals feasible. These arrays consist of only a single active element {{and a number of}} parasitic elements placed in close proximity. Due to strong mutual couplings, the feeding of the active element is responsible for the currents induced to all parasitics. The dynamic control of the parasitic array radiation patterns is performed directly in baseband, through the dynamic control of passive reactive loads connected directly to all parasitics and thus altering mutual coupling and antenna radiation characteristics [24]. Importantly for practical designs, the complete description of the parasitic array performance (return loss, efficiencies, patterns, etc.,) in all possible dynamic states, can be computed based on a single electromagnetic full-wave simulation followed by simple post-processing [23]. It is of course of prime importance to precisely implement the reactive loads, as detailed in [10]. So far, their control has been achieved <b>using</b> <b>varactors</b> or p-i-n diodes. However, as in other applications the use of MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) would result in better performance in terms of insertion loss, linearity, while having virtually zero DC power consumption. In this study, the simulation results presented in the following sections we have not assumed a specific implementation technique but we have restricted our interest to the values of the loads and the corresponding radiation characteristics of the antenna.|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation studies voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs) that operate at low supply voltages. Due to smaller transistor sizes and lower supply voltage ratings with every new CMOS technology, voltage headroom is diminishing. Therefore, {{new ways to}} build VCOs and quadrature VCOs (QVCOs) have been sought to overcome this smaller headroom, while still maintaining the high performance of the circuits. The studies of low voltage VCOs and QVCOs in this thesis are based upon common topologies that use noisy transistors as their current sources. Transistor current sources need an extra voltage margin to operate {{at the expense of}} the oscillator's voltage swing, thereby diminishing the oscillator's performance. One elegant solution to eliminate this problem is to use an on-chip inductor as a current source. A source node inductor value is chosen such that it resonates with the stray capacitance at the second harmonic 2 w 0. This results in a raised impedance at this frequency, which makes the current source more ideal. Furthermore, the source node inductor has the advantage of zero voltage drop and its dynamic voltage swing can be used over the tank to increase the overall voltage headroom of the oscillator, further improving its performance. The phase noise performance of LC oscillators is set by the quality of the tank. A few years ago, on-chip inductors had low quality and were the principal factor in tank losses. Today, however, most CMOS technologies incorporate thick top metal that increase the quality of the inductors significantly. At the same time, MOS varactors operate at reduced quality because of low voltage supply, and for some bias values this quality is as low as on-chip inductors had been in the past. For this reason, modeling of monolithic inductors is here explored with a view toward co-optimizing the inductor and the limitations of low voltage operations <b>using</b> <b>varactors</b> in conjunction with the oscillator's parasitics to maximize the oscillator's performance. When the source node carries a capacitive load, both the balanced and the unbalanced states increase the phase noise contribution substantially. In the balanced state there is an increase switch time and overdrive voltages, which in turn increase the excess noise factor of the transistors. The unbalanced state also contributes phase noise because the source node capacitance opens up a path to the tank that increases with the capacitive load and frequency. The phase noise analysis of a differential LC oscillator has shown that this noise derives from both the balanced and unbalanced states during an oscillation period...|$|E

40|$|Ultra {{narrow-band}} {{filters and}} the use of two loops in a cascade configuration dominate current clock conditioners based on phase-locked-loop (PLL) schemes. Since a PLL exhibits a low-pass transfer function with respect to the reference clock, the noise performance at very close-to-carrier offset frequencies is still determined by the input signal. Although better cleaning can be achieved with extremely narrow loops, an ultra low cut-off frequency could not be selected since the stability of the configuration deteriorates as the filter bandwidth is reduced. This fact suggests that a full-spectrum clock conditioning is not possible using traditional PLL architectures, and an alternative scheme is necessary to attenuate the very-close-to-carrier phase noise (PN). In addition, ultra-narrow loop filters can compromise on-chip integration because of the large size capacitors needed when chosen as passive. Input signal attenuation with relaxed bandwidth requirements becomes the main aspect that a comprehensive clock cleaner must address to effectively regenerate a reference signal. This dissertation describes the Band-Reject Nested-PLL (BRN-PLL) scheme, a modified PLL-based architecture that provides an effective signal cleaning procedure by introducing a notch in the input transfer function through inner and outer loops and a high-pass filter (HPF). This modified response attenuates the reference-signal PN and reduces the size of the loop-filter capacitors substantially. Ultra narrow loops are no longer required because the notch size is related to the system bandwidth. The associated transfer function for the constitutive blocks (phase detectors and local oscillators) show that the output close-to-carrier and far-from-carrier PN sections are mainly dominated by the noise from the inner-PLL phase detector (PD) and local oscillator (LO) located in the outer loop, respectively. The inner-PLL PD transfer function maintains a low-pass characteristic with a passband gain inversely proportional to the PD gain becoming the main contribution around the carrier signal. On the other hand, the PN around the transition frequency is determined mainly by the reference and the inner-PLL LO. Their noise contributions to the output will depend on the associated passband local maxima, which is located at the BRN-PLL transition frequency. Hence, in this region, the inner-PLL LO is selected so that its effect can be held below that of the outer-PLL PD. The BRN-PLL can use a high-Q MEMS-based VCO to further improve the transition region of the output PN profile and an LC-VCO as outer-PLL LO to reduce the noise floor of the output signal. In particular, two tuning mechanisms are explored for the MEMS-VCO: series tuning <b>using</b> <b>varactors</b> and phase shifting of a resonator operating in nonlinear regime. Both schemes are implemented to generate a tunable oscillator with no PN-performance degradation.

40|$|Today’s content-centric mobile world demands Gigabit-per-second (Gbps) {{wireless}} communication systems. With sub- 10 GHz radio frequencies cluttered with existing wireless infrastructures such as 2. 4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi and {{a multitude of}} LTE bands in the 1 - 2 GHz range, focus has shifted to microwaves and mm-waves. The inverse relation between frequency and wavelength (and thus antenna size) differentiates mm-wave solutions in terms of size. For example, a 16 -element antenna array only takes about 1. 5 cm 2 at 60 GHz. The pitfall, however, is the degraded active device performance at these high frequencies. Innovations at circuit-level and architecture-level are thus necessary. The dominant non-idealities that limit the performance of such radios in CMOS are the phase noise of the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), the {{maximum output power of}} power amplifier (PA) limited by device breakdown voltage, and the non-linear behavior of the PA. Circuit and architecture level innovations presented in this research improve state-of-the-art performance in those areas. To address the phase noise limitation, a mm-wave VCO architecture with low phase noise and large tuning range is presented. MM-wave systems rely on large channel bandwidths (e. g. 1. 7 GHz per channel, 7 GHz total) to achieve high data rates. Channel selection <b>using</b> <b>varactors</b> and/or switched-capacitors suffers from poor phase noise performance due to the low quality factor of those elements at mm-waves. In the proposed architecture, the required frequency tuning range is divided amongst four narrow-band clusters of VCOs. Each cluster of VCOs can achieve lower phase noise due to the reduced frequency tuning range requirement. Phase noise of each cluster is further improved by using multiple cores of VCOs connected in parallel with differential transmission lines. The VCO achieves a phase noise of - 101. 8 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset with an FOM of - 182 dB/Hz and over 12. 6 % frequency tuning range (50. 7 GHz to 57. 5 GHz). Another focus of this research is to improve the power amplifier (PA) performance (output power, linearity, and efficiency). Innovations in power combining techniques enable us to achieve the highest reported saturated power level of 22. 6 dBm in CMOS at 60 GHz. Stacking transistors as a second remedy to improve the output power of the PA is considered and trade-offs in gain, reliability, and output power are treated analytically and an optimal stacking strategy for mm-wave PAs is presented. A simulation-based comparison shows the superiority of the proposed optimal stacking approach compared with the conventional stacking approach for a 60 GHz SiGe PA. A wideband self-contained PA linearization technique is presented to address mm-wave PA linearity challenges. The proposed Adaptive Gain and Phase Adjustment (AGPA) linearization technique compensates for both AM-AM and AM-PM distortion of the PA for large channel bandwidths of hundreds of megahertz at mm-waves. The gain and phase linearization loop consists of an envelope detector, an Analog Mapping Core (AMC), and a variable RC feedback network. The detection and adjustment loop has a low group delay and thus enables one of the largest linearization bandwidths published. AGPA improves the OP 1 dB of a stacked mm-wave PA by 2. 8 dB (from 9. 5 dBm to 12. 3 dBm) and reduces the IM 3 products by 3 dB at 8 dBm output power with a tone spacing of 200 MHz. Power Added Efficiency (PAE) at OP 1 dB is improved from 6. 5 % to 10. 5 % by enabling AGPA at 57 GHz...|$|E

The effects of user's hand on the S 11, radiation patterns and efficiency are also characterized. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Recent work {{has indicated that}} scanning can be achieved with significantly reduced complexity and cost using coupled-oscillator techniques. However, the scan range has been somewhat limited using this tecbnique. This paper describes a simple method to greatly enhance the scan range <b>using</b> <b>varactor</b> frequency doublers, which has the added advantage of simplifying the fimdamental mode oscillator design. In an effort to combine power in an efficient way the field of quasi optical power combining was born. [3]-[6] A large number of solid state oscillators can be integrated {{in such a way}} that their respective outputs coherently add in free space. The low loss properties of free space, especially at higher frequencies, along with the reliability of solid state devices make this approach particularly attractive. Extensive work, theoretical [1, 7, 8] and experimental [1, 2] on the coupling dynamics of these discrete oscillators has already been performed. A significant breakthtough of this research was the discovery of a simple way to induce beam scanning in such an array of coupled oscillators[2]. This can be achieved b...|$|R
