25|$|The Aérospatiale SA 360 Dauphin was a {{single-engine}} French <b>utility</b> <b>helicopter</b> {{developed as}} a replacement for Aérospatiale's Alouette III in the early 1970s and to fill a gap in the company's product line in the six to ten-seat helicopter category. However, as the new helicopter offered little advantage over its predecessor and thus limited market appeal, production of the SA 360 Dauphin was abandoned after only a few dozen of them had been built.|$|E

25|$|Indian defence {{companies}} such as HAL and DRDO are developing several aircraft for the IAF such as the HAL Tejas, Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), DRDO AEW (revived from the Airavat Project), NAL Saras, HAL HJT-36 Sitara, HAL HTT-40, HAL Light Combat Helicopter (LCH), HAL Light <b>Utility</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (LUH), DRDO Rustom and AURA (Autonomous Unmanned Research Aircraft) UCAV. DRDO has developed the Akash missile system for the IAF and is developing the Maitri SAM with MBDA. DRDO is also developing the Prithvi II ballistic missile.|$|E
25|$|The Army {{specified}} that the AAH {{was to be}} powered by twin General Electric T700 turboshaft engines that produce 1,500 shp (1,120kW) each. The T700 was the same powerplant fit specified for a new Army <b>utility</b> <b>helicopter</b> competition that would be won by the UH-60 Black Hawk. The AAH would be armed with a 30millimeter cannon and 16 TOW anti-tank missiles. The missile armament specification was later modified to include an alternate load of 16 laser-guided AGM-114 Hellfire anti-tank missiles. The Hellfire was then in development and promised greater range and lethality than TOW.|$|E
25|$|The RCN's then current HO4S-3 <b>utility</b> <b>helicopter</b> {{could not}} operate safely in inclement weather {{with a heavy}} weapons and sensor load, which would be {{imperative}} for the ASW role; hence, a more capable aircraft was needed. Initial 1959 studies identified two helicopters that seemed suitable - the Sikorsky S-61 (HSS-2) and the Kaman K-20 (HU2K)- but neither aircraft had flown at the time, so no choice was made. After further studies concluded that the smaller Kaman would better satisfy RCN requirements, the Treasury Board approved an initial procurement of 12 HU2K helicopters for $14.5 million in December 1960.|$|E
