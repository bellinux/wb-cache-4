With the increasing use of IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) networks, protection of time-critical communication, e. g., voice over IP (VoIP), from unsolicited messages becomes an important topic. The protection against <b>unsolicited</b> <b>communication</b> for IMS (PUCI) borrows the concepts from traditional e-mail spam filtering but needs to adapt to the nature of IMS communication being direct and time critical. In addition to the protection methods identified in TR 33. 937 [1], we present a concept that uses a secure and interoperable scorecard that is associated with the caller and IMS communication. Depending on the outcome of the scorecard evaluation, the receiving domain can take appropriate actions such as denying or allowing a communication attempt. Scorecards are used to generate a standardized exchange format for the sender- and message-related information.

40|$|Abstract—Sender Scorecards are {{conceived}} as a method to enable different IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) domains and networks to exchange trustworthy information on sender identities and other relevant information, to allow discrimination between legitimate and <b>unsolicited</b> IMS <b>communication.</b> The approach uses a secure and interoperable scorecard about the sender of IMS calls. Such a scorecard is generated, transported, and evaluated collaboratively between different network domains. Scorecards are used to generate a standardized exchange format for sender and message related information. Depending {{on the outcome of}} the scorecard evaluation, the receiving domain can take appropriate actions such as denying or allowing a communication attempt. The present paper proposes a blueprint for an IMS architecture including scorecard elements, based on 3 GPP standards.

40|$|Destination choice, as {{the stage}} of {{evaluating}} alternative destinations for travel, is influenced by a range of sources (Crompton, 1992; Decrop & Snelders, 2005; Hyde & Laesser, 2009; Seddighi & Theocharous, 2002; Woodside & Lysonski, 1989). Existing studies have predominantly presented these influences on destination choice as including organic agents, media and word of mouth (WOM) (Croy, 2010; Gartner, 1993; Molina & Esteban, 2006; Moyle & Croy, 2009). These organic agents are taken to {{have high levels of}} credibility and therefore influence in forming perceptions of potential destinations and the decisions to visit or not (Gartner, 1993). Notwithstanding the influence of the media, WOM exerts a strong influence on destination choice (Brown & Getz, 2005; Litvin, Goldsmith & Pan, 2008; Oppermann, 2000; Tasci & Kozak, 2006; Tasci & Gartner, 2007). In this context, WOM is defined as any form of solicited or <b>unsolicited</b> non-paid <b>communication</b> between consumers (Stern, 1994). More recently, WOM has been expanded to include electronic word of mouth (eWOM), synonymous with and on the back of social media (Litvin, et al., 2008; Xiang & Gretzel, 2010). Social media, and eWOM are the user generated content disseminated through electronic mediums (Litvin et al., 2008) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{live in a}} {{world where}} {{consumers}} actively resist marketing. So it’s important to stop marketing at people. The idea is to create an environment where consumers will market to each other 1. Definitely, this idea does not refer to direct marketing at people in the form of unsolicited commercial communication, i. e. spam! Spam is a teething trouble of direct marketing 2 through email. Spam is the bulkmailing, sometimes repeatedly, of unsolicited email messages, usually of a commercial nature, to individuals with whom the mailer has had no previous contact and whose email addresses the mailer collected from the public spaces of the Internet 3. The real problem for direct marketers is how to initiate permission-based direct marketing without interrupting people 4. Seth Godin 5 himself acknowledges that there is great danger for permission-marketing not to be able to eschew interruption-marketing completely in its initial phase. As just the moment that email has become an indispensable form of communication of commercial and non-commercial importance for an ever-growing segment of the world, its value is being undermined by the barrage of <b>unsolicited</b> <b>communication.</b> Email can be used to send unsolicited messages to many people at the same time such as advertisements.

40|$|The open {{architecture}} of the Internet has enabled its massive growth and success by facilitating easy connectivity between hosts. At the same time, the Internet has also opened itself up to abuse, e. g. arising out of <b>unsolicited</b> <b>communication,</b> both intentional and unintentional. It {{remains an open question}} as to how best servers should protect themselves from malicious clients whilst offering good service to innocent clients. There has been research on behavioural profiling and reputation of clients, mostly at the network level and also for email as an application, to detect malicious clients. However, this area continues to pose open research challenges. This thesis is motivated by the need for a generalised framework capable of aiding efficient detection of malicious clients while being able to reward clients with behaviour profiles conforming to the acceptable use and other relevant policies. The main contribution of this thesis is a novel, generalised, context-aware, policy independent, privacy preserving framework for developing and sharing client reputation based on behavioural history. The framework, augmenting existing protocols, allows fitting in of policies at various stages, thus keeping itself open and flexible to implementation. Locally recorded behavioural history of clients with known identities are translated to client reputations, which are then shared globally. The reputations enable privacy for clients by not exposing the details of their behaviour during interactions with the servers. The local and globally shared reputations facilitate servers in selecting service levels, including restricting access to malicious clients. We present results and analyses of simulations, with synthetic data and some proposed example policies, of client-server interactions and of attacks on our model. Suggestions presented for possible future extensions are drawn from our experiences with simulation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Executive summary: The global {{deployment}} of IP networks and the digitisation of content and communications {{have implications for}} the way that communications is regulated in Australia and internationally. Digitisation has created more complex, elongated and global supply chains that challenge traditional national approaches to regulation. At the same time, the open and participatory nature of the internet has allowed users to exercise greater control over aspects of their communications. As increasing amounts of both personal and institutional data is transferred internationally, regulatory approaches that are effective across jurisdictional boundaries are important in realising {{the social and economic}} benefits of a free flow of data across borders along with appropriate protections for the security of individuals and organisations. In its work identifying the enduring regulatory concepts that frame communications and media regulatory interventions, the ACMA noted common design features of converged regulation including flexible and calibrated regulatory tools, a recognition of shared responsibility between individuals, industry participants and government in an environment where individuals create as well as consume communications and media and the role of global engagement strategies. This paper takes {{a closer look at the}} collaboration and engagement strategies used by regulators in Australia and internationally in response to the challenges presented by globalisation and the rise of participant users in internet-enabled communications and media. A variety of tools and strategies has been used both domestically and internationally to deal with these issues, ranging from industry and citizen education to enforcement of compliance requirements. Increasingly, the cross-border nature of online activities requires that the regulatory tools in place at the national level be linked to multi-level, international regulatory strategies. While the discussion of tools is organised on the basis of international, national, industry and citizen/consumer tools, it is important to note that these elements may be connected to form an overarching strategy.

There was consensus of the participants that while spam may be ill defined as unwanted or <b>unsolicited</b> electronic <b>communication</b> or email, it is the delivery mechanism whereby malware, botnets, and phishing attacks infect unsuspecting users.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of Internet technologies {{has led to}} the emergence of new communication means. E-mail has become a new powerful tool used by millions with the main purpose of exchanging information. Considering its large scope, marketers have been using the e-mail as an important direct marketing force and it has become a popular choice for many companies. The e-mail has therefore constituted a new form of on-line marketing coined “E-mail marketing”. However, the increasing use of the e-mail marketing has been adversely affected by the appearance of non-traditional marketing communication media such as unsolicited commercial e-mails (UCEs). The main reasons behind the alarming growth of the UCEs are those explained by the low-cost structure of the e-mail and, thus, a small number of responses are required for generating a profit (Moustakas et al., 2006; p. 45; Shenoy, 2008; p. 32). This unsolicited medium used for reaching consumers has evolved from mere nuisance to actual threat (Mendleson, 2010; p. 38), which has brought a new complexity into consumers’ daily lives. This in its turn calls for examination of consumer’s perception about the unsolicited commercial e-mails.   Hence, the aim of this thesis is to examine consumer’s perceptions about the mentioned <b>unsolicited</b> marketing <b>communication</b> medium. This will provide increased awareness of the profound implications that the UCEs have on e-commerce and the e-mail marketing on the whole and, particularly, on Internet user groups such as companies, e-mail service providers and policy makers. The study was conducted with a positivistic position and followed a deductive approach, taking known theories as point of departure. The theories presented are mainly concerned with: privacy, ethical and legislation issues; consumer’s reactions and motives behind the opening of the e-mail; the impact of the UCEs on the brand image and overall implications of the UCEs.   A self-completion questionnaire was used as method of data collection. The results indicate that the UCEs are perceived as slightly unethical and neither intrusive nor nonintrusive by the respondents. There is also no clear perceived protection by the anti-spam law, which claims the need for improvement of the policy makers’ work. The results also reveal that the most common consumer’s reaction is to disregard and delete the UCEs, although a small but considerable percentage of the consumers respond. The findings show that the different contents of the UCEs are perceived with low levels of interest by the respondents. Also, the motives behind the opening of the UCEs by the respondents are distributed nearly equal: the credibility of the sender, simply the curiosity and the attractiveness of the subject line. This study reveals a fairly negative perceived image of the companies advertised by the UCEs, which proves the associated cost of sending the UCEs. Furthermore, it has been found that the respondents are concerned about sharing their e-mail addresses with e-companies because of the UCEs and that the latter hinder the accessibility to solicited commercial e-mails in the e-mail inboxes. The e-mail service providers have been also affected since a quarter of the respondents have changed them as a consequence of receiving the UCEs. Thus, the results of this thesis show the adverse implications of the UCEs on electronic commerce, e-mail marketing and on Internet user groups...|$|R
40|$|AimsPeople {{with serious}} mental illness are {{increasingly}} turning to popular social media, including Facebook, Twitter or YouTube, {{to share their}} illness experiences or seek advice from others with similar health conditions. This emerging form of <b>unsolicited</b> <b>communication</b> among self-forming online communities of patients and individuals with diverse health concerns {{is referred to as}} peer-to-peer support. We offer a perspective on how online peer-to-peer connections among people with serious mental illness could advance efforts to promote mental and physical wellbeing in this group. MethodsIn this commentary, we take the perspective that when an individual with serious mental illness decides to connect with similar others online it represents a critical point in their illness experience. We propose a conceptual model to illustrate how online peer-to-peer connections may afford opportunities for individuals with serious mental illness to challenge stigma, increase consumer activation and access online interventions for mental and physical well-being. ResultsPeople with serious mental illness report benefits from interacting with peers online from greater social connectedness, feelings of group belonging and by sharing personal stories and strategies for coping with day-to-day challenges of living with a mental illness. Within online communities, individuals with serious mental illness could challenge stigma through personal empowerment and providing hope. By learning from peers online, these individuals may gain insight about important health care decisions, which could promote mental health care seeking behaviours. These individuals could also access interventions for mental and physical wellbeing delivered through social media that could incorporate mutual support between peers, help promote treatment engagement and reach a wider demographic. Unforeseen risks may include exposure to misleading information, facing hostile or derogatory comments from others, or feeling more uncertain about one 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s health condition. However, given the evidence to date, the benefits of online peer-to-peer support appear to outweigh the potential risks. ConclusionFuture research must explore these opportunities to support and empower people with serious mental illness through online peer networks while carefully considering potential risks that may arise from online peer-to-peer interactions. Efforts will also need to address methodological challenges in the form of evaluating interventions delivered through social media and collecting objective mental and physical health outcome measures online. A key challenge will be to determine whether skills learned from peers in online networks translate into tangible and meaningful improvements in recovery, employment, or mental and physical wellbeing in the offline world.

40|$|The Netherlands {{is among}} the few {{countries}} that have put specific net neutrality standards in place. It was the first country {{to do so in}} the European Union. Contrary to the original European Union approach, which lacks a material implementation of net neutrality principles, the Dutch parliament decided to take a firmer position and introduced a quite detailed regimen on net neutrality. Providers of public electronic communications networks via which Internet access services are delivered and providers of Internet access services shall not hinder or slow down applications or services on the Internet. There is a limited group of exceptions to this rule. Hindering and slowing down Internet traffic is allowed a) to minimise the effects of congestion, whereby equal types of traffic must be treated equally, b) to preserve the integrity and security of the network and service of the provider in question or the end-user’s terminal, c) to restrict the transmission of <b>unsolicited</b> <b>communication</b> (spam) to end-users, provided that the end-users have given their prior consent for this to be done, and d) to implement a legislative provision or court order. Another very important net neutrality principle was based on incidents of blocked applications such as Skype and WhatsApp on the announcement by mobile operators that they would start charging for applications. The Dutch net neutrality article also forbids providers of Internet access services to charge for Internet access services dependent on the services and applications which are offered or used via these services. The newly proposed European rules on net neutrality (as part of the new regulatory package) have borrowed heavily from the Dutch example. However, are the Dutch rules a success? The no-blocking/no-charging restriction had an immediate effect on the market, in particular on the mobile one. Originally, the mobile providers intended to block or to charge for specific services (Skype, WhatsApp), but they had to abandon the idea due to the new net neutrality rules. This led to a new subscription structure, with a substantially increased emphasis on data traffic. Data bundles are priced more specifically, and existing packages with unlimited data access have been replaced by packages with a specific size (data caps) and specific speeds. In fact, voice is no longer a dominant factor in the pricing models. But how did these changes affect the consumer? The no-blocking/no-charging rule more or less killed traditional texting (SMS), but it is too early to tell whether net neutrality has had an effect on the overall costs for mobile broadband. There are some indications that the overall price levels and options in the Dutch market are (still) in line with the prices in other European countries. The new neutrality rules had no effect on the fixed market. Internet service providers on cabled networks have no history of blocking traffic. Only one incident with the slow-down of traffic was reported but turned out to be a ‘misunderstanding’. One should keep in mind that the Dutch fixed broadband market is very competitive with the incumbent operator offering high-speed DSL or fibre and the cable television network operators offering high-speed broadband via their coaxial networks. The Netherlands belongs to the top broadband countries in the world. The regulator in charge - the Authority for Consumers and Markets - took a first decision on applying the new rules in a case where Internet access in trains was blocked for congestion reasons. In another case, a service similar to WhatsApp was inaccessible via wireless networks. In two cases, the Authority investigated the bundling of data packages with free services (i. e. a mobile subscription with ‘free’ access to Spotify). To deal with these cases, a new guideline has been drafted by the ministry involved. The consultation process on the guideline has recently ended. The conclusion of the paper is that putting net neutrality into more material regulation is much more complicated than defining it in a more abstract sense. Putting the rules into practice is even more challenging. In our view, the Dutch example shows that if regulation is too detailed, the development of services might be hampered and might to some extent ridicule the true objectives of net neutrality. The focus should be on a dynamic and evolutionary approach, offering the opportunity to adapt interventions quickly, depending on the specifics of the case. In order to establish such a more flexible framework, the present provision needs to be amended...|$|E
