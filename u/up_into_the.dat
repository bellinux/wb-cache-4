5|$|During the 1938–39 season, Harvey was {{selected}} for the Victorian Second XI {{to play in a}} match against their counterparts from New South Wales. Harvey was run out for four in the first innings and then made eight as his team succumbed to a 227-run defeat. As a result, he was not called <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> First XI for the next two years.|$|E

5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E

5|$|Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in phospholipid and cholesterol homeostasis. After binding ApoER2, ApoE is taken <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cell and may remain in the intracellular space, be shipped to the cell surface, or be degraded. ApoE binding leads to the cleavage of ApoER2 into secreted proteins by the actions of the plasma membrane protein gamma secretase. ApoE may be the signalling ligand responsible for ApoER2's role in modulating the JNK signalling pathway.|$|E
5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell {{penetrated}} {{the side of the}} ship five feet above the main battery deck, and caused a number of small fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four propellant charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> turret and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins {{was born}} in Nairobi, then in British Kenya, on 26 March 1941. He {{is the son of}} Jean Mary Vyvyan (née Ladner) and Clinton John Dawkins, who was an {{agricultural}} civil servant in the British Colonial Service in Nyasaland (now Malawi). His father was called <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> King's African Rifles during World War II and returned to England in 1949, when Dawkins was eight. His father had inherited a country estate, Over Norton Park in Oxfordshire, which he farmed commercially. Dawkins considers himself English and lives in Oxford, England. Dawkins has a younger sister.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{contract}} with Sengoku, Mann went on to make his North American debut against Doug Evans on 11 September 2010 at Shark Fights 13. The bout saw Mann hit Evans with multiple combinations and low kicks, before utilising a flying knee. Evans counter-attacked with takedowns, which he kept <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> final round. Mann won the bout via split decision (47–48, 48–47, 48–47) to become the new Shark Fights Featherweight champion.|$|E
5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, much of {{the area}} that forms today's Cleland Conservation Park was {{purchased}} by the State Government, {{in large part because}} of the lobbying efforts of Professor Sir John Cleland. Most of this land, including the Waterfall Gully area, was later combined in 1963 to create the park that extends eastwards <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hills to the summit of Mount Lofty and northwards to Greenhill Road. During 1943, the Municipality of Burnside was proclaimed the City of Burnside.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that plants {{can be a}} vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters grass that grew on ground where a deer that died with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> leaf and stem structure, {{where they can be}} eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E
5|$|In larger lek groups {{there is}} less risk of predation. In a group there are more {{individuals}} to alert the group about an approaching predator. All the birds in the groups will be vigilant in looking for a predator because there is an advantage to seeing the predator first. There is also the risk that in a bigger group there will more false alarm signals. The common signal is vocalization, after which the birds will fly <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trees. It was found the birds did not however give this signal {{when there was a}} snake.|$|E
5|$|In the 1947–48 season, the England cricket team {{toured the}} West Indies. When the team played in Trinidad, Ganteaume scored 101 and 47 not {{out in the}} first match but journalists criticised him for scoring slowly in easy batting conditions. In a second match against the touring side, he scored 5 and 90 but was not {{selected}} in the team for the Test match which followed—Ganteaume later suggested his non-selection was a result of his underprivileged background. However, an injury to Jeff Stollmeyer, one of the West Indies' opening batsmen, before the game meant that Ganteaume was called <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> side.|$|E

5|$|It {{is known}} McCudden proved remarkably good at {{stalking}} tactics, which {{enabled him to}} get up underneath an opponent, pull down the wing gun and fire <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> German machine. The first the recipients would know of the attack was bullets coming up through {{the bottom of the}} fuselage of the aircraft, often causing death or injury, holing petrol tanks and crippling engines. The gun, being fed by a drum of ammunition, could also be reloaded in its pulled-down position, the pilot having two or more spare drums located in his cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as possible. He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta and <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was {{getting rid of the}} Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomics {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} functional ecology of environmental communities. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the defecations of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient-rich sea lion faeces {{may be an important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. This is because the bacteria that are expelled simultaneously with the defecations are adept at breaking down the nutrients in the faeces into a bioavailable form that can be taken <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> food chain.|$|E

The comic flies out the entrance and is shredded by Santa's Little Helper on the ground, hit by lightning, and completely destroyed.

5|$|Paul Baras of Brasier set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the race}} on his first lap.

Hot conditions melted the road tar, which the cars kicked <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> faces of the drivers, blinding them and making the racing treacherous. Punctures were common; tyre manufacturer Michelin introduced a detachable rim with a tyre already affixed, which could be quickly swapped onto a car after a puncture, saving a significant amount of time over manually replacing the tyre. This helped Nazzaro pass Clément on the second day, as the FIAT—unlike the Clément-Bayard—made use of the rims.|$|E
