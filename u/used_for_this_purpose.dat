5|$|Metallic {{americium}} {{is obtained}} by reduction from its compounds. Americium(III) fluoride was first <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose.</b> The reaction was conducted using elemental barium as reducing agent in a water- and oxygen-free environment inside an apparatus made of tantalum and tungsten.|$|E
5|$|Metallic curium is {{obtained}} {{by reduction of}} its compounds. Initially, curium(III) fluoride was <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose.</b> The reaction was conducted in the environment free from water and oxygen, in the apparatus made of tantalum and tungsten, using elemental barium or lithium as reducing agents.|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} effect of qigong exercises on movement disorders found that the evidence was insufficient to recommend its <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{potentially}} {{effective against}} bacterial infections, its toxicity prevents its <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose.</b> It {{has been studied}} {{in the treatment of}} warts but is of unclear benefit.|$|R
25|$|Treatment of {{osteoporosis}} in postmenopausal women. Although they have previously been approved <b>for</b> <b>this</b> indication, AAS saw very little <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose</b> {{due to their}} virilizing side effects.|$|R
5|$|The same {{material}} also functions in newer alkaline batteries (usually battery cells), which {{use the same}} basic reaction, but a different electrolyte mixture. In 2002, more than 230,000tons of manganese dioxide was <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
5|$|FPGAs can be {{programmed}} with hardware description languages such as VHDL or Verilog. However, programming in these languages can be tedious. Several vendors have created C to HDL languages {{that attempt to}} emulate the syntax and semantics of the C programming language, with which most programmers are familiar. The best known C to HDL languages are Mitrion-C, Impulse C, DIME-C, and Handel-C. Specific subsets of SystemC based on C++ can also be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{those with}} {{recurrent}} infections, taking a short course of antibiotics when each infection occurs {{is associated with}} the lowest antibiotic use. A prolonged course of daily antibiotics is also effective. Medications frequently used include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Methenamine is another agent <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose</b> as in the bladder where the acidity is low it produces formaldehyde to which resistance does not develop. Some recommend against prolonged use due to concerns of antibiotic resistance.|$|E
25|$|One review {{concluded}} that probiotics {{may help prevent}} re-occurrence. Another review found that while there is tentative evidence it is {{not strong enough to}} recommend their <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|R

5|$|Platinum is a {{precious}} metal commodity; its bullion has the ISO currency code of XPT. Coins, bars, and ingots are traded or collected. Platinum finds use in jewellery, usually as a 90–95% alloy, {{due to its}} inertness. It is <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose</b> for its prestige and inherent bullion value. Jewellery trade publications advise jewellers to present minute surface scratches (which they term patina) as a desirable feature in attempt to enhance value of platinum products.|$|E
5|$|Strontium {{chloride}} {{is sometimes}} used in toothpastes for sensitive teeth. One popular brand includes 10% total {{strontium chloride hexahydrate}} by weight. Small amounts {{are used in the}} refining of zinc to remove small amounts of lead impurities. The metal itself has a limited use as a getter, to remove unwanted gases in vacuums by reacting with them, although barium may also be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Clark family {{mansion and}} its estate {{at the edge}} of the village are now owned by Millfield School. The company, through the Society of Friends, also had its own small {{sanatorium}} and convalescent home on Ivythorn Hill overlooking the town. In 1931, the chalet-style building was leased to the Youth Hostel Association and became the first youth hostel in Somerset. It is still <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E

5|$|Onions may {{be grown}} from seed or from sets. Onion seeds are {{short-lived}} and fresh seeds germinate better. The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning {{the plants in}} stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter {{in the ground and}} produce early crops the following year. Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose</b> and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.|$|E
5|$|The civil weight {{systems were}} {{generally}} {{very similar to}} the apothecaries' system, and since the libbra (or the libbra sottile, where different systems were in use for light and heavy goods) generally had a suitable weight for an apothecaries' pound it was often <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose.</b> Extreme cases were Rome and Genoa, where the same system was used for everything, including medicine. On the other hand, there were relatively large differences even between two cities in the same state. E.g. Bologna (in the Papal States) had an apothecaries' pound that was less than the local civil pound, and 4% lighter than the pound used in Rome.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>use</b> of 8-1-1 <b>for</b> [...] "call {{before you}} dig" [...] {{services}} was long established in California and Nevada, through an organization known as Underground Service Alert, before the FCC mandated its <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|R
25|$|Baclofen {{is being}} studied for the {{treatment}} of alcoholism. While evidence is promising that it may help with alcohol withdrawal syndrome, as of 2017 it is not strong enough to recommend its <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to being operated as private businesses, mobile catering vehicles are also used after natural disasters to feed people in areas with damaged infrastructure. The Salvation Army has several mobile kitchens that it <b>uses</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{greens are}} edible as a leaf vegetable, but are rarely eaten by humans; some sources {{suggest that the}} greens contain toxic alkaloids. When <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose,</b> they are {{harvested}} young in high-density plantings, before significant root development, and typically used stir-fried, or in salads. Some people are allergic to carrots. In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some degree of sensitivity to carrots. Because the major carrot allergen, the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is cross-reactive with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also allergic to pollen from these plants.|$|E
5|$|The new {{industrial}} workforce often {{lived and}} worked under very poor conditions, and enjoyed few employment rights. Workers who left their jobs in protest could find themselves arrested by the mounted police {{under the terms of}} the Masters and Servants Act for deserting their employment, or alternatively detained under the vagrancy laws. Although the position of organised labour was weak in Canada – the trade unions only had very limited legal rights – the number of industrial disputes grew significantly over this period. The resulting lockouts and strikes sometimes required armed government intervention. The militia was most commonly <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose,</b> but the mounted police were cheaper to deploy and were considered to be more politically reliable.|$|E
5|$|Although {{connected}} with the council, Gilbert was tried after the council closed, at a consistory held in the Archbishop of Reims' chambers. A consistory was a specialized form of trial held to investigate questionable theological teachings, and was beginning to be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose</b> in this period. The consistory lasted two days, and included John of Salisbury, who had previously been a student of Gilbert's, but was now in Eugene's service. The trial likely took place on 2–3 April 1148, as it lasted took two days, and most accounts state that it {{took place during the}} week before Palm Sunday, which was 4 April that year. As the consistory took place after the closing of the council on 1 April, that only allows 2 and 3 April for the trial. However, if the council closed earlier than 1 April, then the trial could have taken place on 29–30 March 1148. In the end, no verdict of heresy was placed against Gilbert, who remained Bishop of Poitiers until his death in 1154.|$|E

5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose,</b> but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} white spore print. Spores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and measure 3.5–5 by 2–3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped and four-spored, with dimensions of 18–22 by 5–5.6μm. H.nidulans has a monomitic hyphal system, containing only generative hyphae with clamp connections. In the flesh, these hyphae are thick-walled and highly branched, measuring up to 10μm in diameter; hyphae comprising the pores and the subhymenium are thinner (up to 6μm wide) and less branched. A chemical test {{can be used}} to help identify H.nidulans: all parts of the fruit body will instantly stain bright violet if a drop of an alkaline solution is applied. Dilute (3–10%) potassium hydroxide (KOH), is often <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Glass {{can also}} be welded to metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose,</b> ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E
