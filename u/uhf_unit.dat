25|$|In a middeck stowage locker, Atlantis {{carried the}} Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Ultra High Frequency (<b>UHF)</b> Communication <b>Unit</b> (CUCU) {{developed}} by Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) {{in collaboration with}} NASA to the ISS. It will be integrated on the space station in preparation for future SpaceX flights to the orbiting complex. The unit allows for communication between ISS and SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft via a UHF radio. Commands from SpaceX can be forwarded through ISS to CUCU and on to Dragon. Similarly, telemetry from Dragon and CUCU can be forwarded down through ISS for monitoring by SpaceX and NASA ground-based mission control. The Crew Command Panel (CCP) provides feedback {{about the state of}} the Dragon vehicle to astronauts aboard ISS. It additionally provides some simple commanding capability to the astronauts to be used during the Dragon approach to ISS.|$|R
50|$|On 23 February 2009, SpaceX {{announced}} that its chosen phenolic-impregnated carbon ablator heat shield material, PICA-X, had passed heat stress tests {{in preparation for}} Dragon's maiden launch. The primary proximity-operations sensor for the Dragon spacecraft, the DragonEye, was tested in early 2009 during the STS-127 mission, when it was mounted near the docking port of the Space Shuttle Endeavour and used while the Shuttle approached the International Space Station. The DragonEye's Lidar and thermography (thermal imaging) abilities were both tested successfully. The COTS <b>UHF</b> Communication <b>Unit</b> (CUCU) and Crew Command Panel (CCP) were delivered to the ISS during the late 2009 STS-129 mission. The CUCU allows the ISS to communicate with Dragon and the CCP allows ISS crew members to issue basic commands to Dragon. In summer 2009, SpaceX hired former NASA astronaut Ken Bowersox {{as vice president of}} their new Astronaut Safety and Mission Assurance Department, in preparation for crews using the spacecraft.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} high {{efficiency}} RFID <b>UHF</b> power converter <b>unit</b> {{to overcome the}} low efficiency problem. This power converter is mainly composed of an RF-DC converter and a DC-DC converter. In order to overcome the low efficiency problem in low current consuming condition, a DC-DC converter is added to conventional single RF-DC converter rectifier to increase the rectifying efficiency of the RFDC rectifier. The power converter is implemented in a 0. 18 um mixed signal, 1 p 6 m CMOS technology. Simulation shows the power converter has an average improvement of 5 % and can achieve efficiency as high as 30 % with 900 MHz, 16 uW RF input power and 1. 3 V 3. 6 uA DC output. IEEE...|$|R
