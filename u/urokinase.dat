5|$|Thrombolysis is enzymatic {{destruction}} of blood clots. This {{is achieved by}} the administration of a drug (such as <b>urokinase</b> or alteplase) that activates plasmin, an enzyme that occurs naturally {{in the body and}} digests clots when activated. Thrombolysis is an accepted treatment for heart attacks and stroke unrelated to dissection. In cervical artery dissection, only small case series are available. The thrombolytic drug is administered either intravenously or during cerebral angiography through a catheter directly into the affected artery. The data indicates that thrombolysis is safe, but its place in the treatment of VAD is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} inhibitors of <b>urokinase</b> are the serpins plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2), which inhibit the protease activity irreversibly. In the extracellular matrix, <b>urokinase</b> is {{tethered to the}} cell membrane by its interaction to the <b>urokinase</b> receptor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Urokinase</b> is a 411-residue protein, {{consisting}} of three domains: the serine protease domain, the kringle domain, {{and the growth}} factor domain. <b>Urokinase</b> is synthesized as a zymogen form (prourokinase or single-chain <b>urokinase),</b> and is activated by proteolytic cleavage between Lys158 and Ile159. The two resulting chains are kept together by a disulfide bond.|$|E
25|$|Elevated {{expression}} {{levels of}} <b>urokinase</b> {{and several other}} components of the plasminogen activation system {{are found to be}} correlated with tumor malignancy. It is believed that the tissue degradation following plasminogen activation facilitates tissue invasion and, thus, contributes to metastasis. This makes <b>urokinase</b> an attractive drug target, and, so, inhibitors have been sought to be used as anticancer agents. However, incompatibilities between the human and murine systems hamper clinical evaluation of these agents. Through its interaction with the <b>urokinase</b> receptor, <b>urokinase</b> affects several other aspects of cancer biology such as cell adhesion, migration, and cellular mitotic pathways.|$|E
25|$|<b>Urokinase</b> is used {{clinically}} as a thrombolytic {{agent in}} the treatment of severe or massive deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and occluded intravenous or dialysis cannulas. It is also administered intrapleurally to improve the drainage of complicated pleural effusions and empyemas. <b>Urokinase</b> is marketed as Abbokinase or Kinlytic and competes with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (e.g., alteplase) as a thrombolytic drug in infarction. However, <b>urokinase</b> is not very selective for clot-bound plasminogen, unlike tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) which preferentially interacts with clot-bound plasminogen. Because <b>urokinase</b> binds about equally to freely circulating plasminogen and clot-bound plasminogen, it causes significant fibrinogenolysis and clot fibrinolysis making its use less favorable than TPA.|$|E
25|$|<b>Urokinase,</b> {{also known}} as urokinase-type {{plasminogen}} activator (uPA), is a serine protease present in humans and other animals. The human <b>urokinase</b> protein was discovered, but not named, by McFarlane and Pilling in 1947. <b>Urokinase</b> was originally isolated from human urine, {{and it is also}} present in the blood and in the extracellular matrix of many tissues. The primary physiological substrate of this enzyme is plasminogen, which is an inactive form (zymogen) of the serine protease plasmin. Activation of plasmin triggers a proteolytic cascade that, depending on the physiological environment, participates in thrombolysis or extracellular matrix degradation. This cascade had been involved in vascular diseases and cancer progression.|$|E
25|$|Postmortem {{studies of}} the BBB, {{especially}} the vascular endothelium, show immunological abnormalities. Microvessels in periplaque areas coexpressed HLA-DR and VCAM-1, some others HLA-DR and <b>urokinase</b> plasminogen activator receptor, and others HLA-DR and ICAM-1.|$|E
25|$|The other PAI, {{plasminogen}} activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) is secreted by {{the placenta}} and only present in significant amounts during pregnancy. In addition, protease nexin {{acts as an}} inhibitor of tPA and <b>urokinase.</b> PAI-1, however, is the main inhibitor of the plasminogen activators.|$|E
25|$|PAI-1 is a serine {{protease}} inhibitor (serpin) that functions {{as the principal}} inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and <b>urokinase</b> (uPA), the activators of plasminogen and hence fibrinolysis (the physiological breakdown of blood clots). It is a {{serine protease}} inhibitor (serpin) protein (SERPINE1).|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{thrombolytic}} agent being used, additional anticoagulation with heparin or {{low molecular}} weight heparin may be of benefit. With tPa and related agents (reteplase and tenecteplase), heparin is {{needed to keep the}} coronary artery open. Because of the anticoagulant effect of fibrinogen depletion with streptokinase and <b>urokinase</b> treatment, it is less necessary there.|$|E
25|$|Clinically, {{the most}} useful {{metabolic}} markers in breast cancer are the estrogen and progesterone receptors {{that are used to}} predict response to hormone therapy. New or potentially new markers for breast cancer include BRCA1 and BRCA2 to identify patients at high risk of developing breast cancer, HER-2 and SCD1 for predicting response to therapeutic regimens, and <b>urokinase</b> plasminogen activator, PA1-1 and SCD1 for assessing prognosis.|$|E
25|$|PAI-1's main {{function}} entails the inhibition of <b>urokinase</b> plasminogen activator (uPA), an enzyme {{responsible for the}} cleavage of plasminogen to form plasmin. Plasmin mediates the degradation of the extracellular matrix either by itself or in conjunction with matrix metalloproteinases. In this scenario, PAI-1 inhibits uPA via active site binding, preventing the formation of plasmin. Additional inhibition is mediated by PAI-1 binding to the uPA/uPA receptor complex, resulting in the latter's degradation. Thus, PAI {{can be said to}} inhibit the serine proteases tPA and uPA/urokinase, and hence is an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, the physiological process that degrades blood clots. In addition, PAI-1 inhibits the activity of matrix metalloproteinases, which {{play a crucial role in}} invasion of malignant cells through the basal lamina.|$|E
2500|$|In circulation, {{plasminogen}} {{adopts a}} closed, activation resistant conformation. [...] Upon binding to clots, {{or to the}} cell surface, plasminogen adopts an open form that can be converted into active plasmin {{by a variety of}} enzymes, including tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), <b>urokinase</b> plasminogen activator (uPA), kallikrein, and factor XII (Hageman factor). Fibrin is a cofactor for plasminogen activation by tissue plasminogen activator. <b>Urokinase</b> plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a cofactor for plasminogen activation by <b>urokinase</b> plasminogen activator. [...] The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin involves the cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg-561 and Val-562.|$|E

2500|$|Although no perfect {{thrombolytic}} agent exists, ideally {{it would}} lead to rapid reperfusion, have a high sustained patency rate, be specific for recent thrombi, be easily and rapidly administered, create a low risk for intracerebral bleeding and systemic bleeding, have no antigenicity, adverse hemodynamic effects, or clinically significant drug interactions, and be cost effective. Currently available thrombolytic agents include streptokinase, <b>urokinase,</b> and alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rtPA). [...] More recently, thrombolytic agents similar in structure to rtPA such as reteplase and tenecteplase have been used. These newer agents boast efficacy at least as well as rtPA with significantly easier administration. The thrombolytic agent used in a particular individual is based on institution preference and the age of the patient.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Urokinase</b> {{receptor}}, {{also known}} as uPA receptor or uPAR or CD87 (Cluster of Differentiation 87), is multidomain glycoprotein tethered to the cell membrane with a glycosylphosphotidylinositol (GPI) anchor. uPAR was originally identified as a saturable binding site for <b>urokinase</b> on the cell surface.|$|E

50|$|Cathepsin B {{may enhance}} the {{activity}} of other protease, including matrix metalloproteinase, <b>urokinase</b> (serine protease <b>urokinase</b> plasminogen activator), and cathepsin D, and thus it has an essential position for in the proteolysis of extracellular matrix components, intercellular communication disruption, and reduced protease inhibitor expression. It is also involved in autophagy and cannibalism, which is advantageous in tumor malignancy and is possibly involved in specific immune resistance.|$|E
5000|$|Angiogenesis {{requires}} the migration and invasive growth of cells. This is facilitated by a balanced interplay between detachment and formation of cell adhesions which enable the cell to crawl forward through the ECM. [...] The cell uses limited proteolytic activity at sites of individual focal adhesions via {{the formation of}} multiprotein complexes. Multiprotein complexes are localized in lipid rafts on the cell surface, where membrane bound proteases are often incorporated. For example, leukocytes complex <b>urokinase</b> (uPA), <b>urokinase</b> receptor (uPAR), and integrins which participate in cell adhesion and invasion. [...] In these complexes, uPAR acts as an organizing center forming noncovalent complexes with integrins, LRP-like proteins, and <b>urokinase.</b> Similar complexes also are found on ECs.|$|E
50|$|Tissue {{plasminogen}} activator (t-PA) and <b>urokinase</b> are {{the agents}} that convert plasminogen to the active plasmin, thus allowing fibrinolysis to occur. t-PA is {{released into the}} blood very slowly by the damaged endothelium of the blood vessels, such that, after several days (when the bleeding has stopped), the clot is broken down. This occurs because plasminogen became entrapped within the clot when it formed; as it is slowly activated, it breaks down the fibrin mesh. t-PA and <b>urokinase</b> are themselves inhibited by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-1 and PAI-2). In contrast, plasmin further stimulates plasmin generation by producing more active forms of both tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and <b>urokinase.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{successful}} use of <b>urokinase</b> in {{a newborn}} with an aortic clot has been reported, but the bleeding {{risks associated with}} thrombolytic agents are still unclear.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the primary}} ligand <b>urokinase,</b> uPAR interacts {{with several other}} proteins, among others: vitronectin, the uPAR {{associated}} protein (uPARAP) and the integrin family of membrane proteins.|$|E

5000|$|... uPAR {{consists}} of three different domains of the Ly-6/uPAR/alpha-neurotoxin family. All three domains are necessary for high affinity binding of the primary ligand, <b>urokinase.</b> It has been possible to express uPAR recombinantly in CHO-cells and S2 cells from Drosophila melanogaster. 4 out of 5 of the possible glycosylation sites are used in vivo giving the protein a molecular weight of 50-60 kDA. Recently the structure of uPAR was solved by X-ray crystallography in complex with a peptide antagonist and with its native ligand, <b>urokinase.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Many {{additional}} {{classes of}} enzymes {{have been identified}} that facilitate angiogenesis. They include serine, aspartic, and cysteine-type proteases. A highly characterized example of the serine protease family is the plasminogen activator-plasmin system, which has been show {{to be involved in}} vascular remodeling. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and <b>urokinase</b> plasminogen activator (<b>urokinase,</b> uPA) are serine proteases which cleave and activate plasminogen. The activated form of plasminogen, plasmin, is a wide ranging protease capable of acting on various ECM components including fibrin, collagens, laminin, fibronectin, and proteoglycans. [...] Additionally, plasmin also is able to activate various other MMPs.|$|E
