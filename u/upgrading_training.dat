30|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{productivity}} as a determinant of the worker’s retirement intentions. Using an overlapping generation framework, we analyze the retirement decision of a cohort of workers being ability heterogeneous. The labor market is endogenously segmented between workers having the required ability level to occupy jobs where the productivity is indexed to the technological state via on-the-job training (complex jobs) {{and the rest of}} workers, who are employed in positions where productivity is relatively deteriorated in case of technological change due to the absence of on-the-job training (simple jobs). In case of technological change, workers in complex jobs delay their retirement date, whereas workers in simple positions will not modify their retirement decision unless taxes change. Using data from France, we find that after a technological change, older workers who benefit from a skill <b>upgrading</b> <b>training</b> program have a higher intended retirement age.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{underlines the}} major role of {{productivity}} as a determinant of the worker’sretirement expectations. We propose an overlapping generation {{model with a}} continuum of heterogeneous ability workers. The labor market is endogenously segmented between worker’s having the required ability level to occupy jobs where the productivity is indexed to the technological state (complex jobs) {{and the rest of}} workers who are employed in positions whose productivity will be relatively deteriorated in case of technological change (simple jobs). We show that, for a given state of technology, workers in complex positions have a latter retirement date than those in simple positions. Furthermore, in case of a positive technological change, workers in complex positions delay retirement whereas those in simple jobs advance retirement. These findings are confirmed by our empirical approach, where we find that, after a technological change, workers who benefit from a skill <b>upgrading</b> <b>training</b> program have a higher expected retirement ag...|$|E
40|$|Today, it is {{essential}} to help the students who intend to become professionals, because the ratio of those students is supposed to increase in the future. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide useful knowledge for promoting those students'career development. First, previous psychological studies regarding the vocational decision in the students intending to become professionals were reviewed. As a result, it became clear that (a) the level of vocational decision in those students is higher than that in the other students, that (b) the level of vocational decision in those students has relation to 'job orientation'in them, and that (c) the scale to assess orientation toward a profession (Profession Orientation Scale) has not been developed. Second, according to (c), previous sociological studies regarding the definition of a profession were reviewed in order to construct the concept of 'profession'that could become a framework of Profession Orientation Scale. As a result, it was found that the concept of 'profession'was constructed by five features; altruism, autonomy, human relationships in professional community, qualification, and skill <b>upgrading</b> <b>training...</b>|$|E

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} that policy makers face in the health sector in Tanzania is how to attract qualified human resources to the rural and remote parts of Tanzania. Currently the government has been able to only employ 35 % of needed work force. The distribution of the employed health workers is characterized by geographical imbalance, attributed by reluctance to work in remote and rural. In addressing the gap, the government has increased training of lower carder health workers. However, less is known on how the newly trained lower carders would respond to known job attributes (incentiveswhile eliciting choices for particular place; particularly their attraction to rural and remote areas. To determine the important financial and non-financial incentives that would attract low level trained health workers to work in rural and remote areas. A cross sectional explorative study using experimental economics design of discrete choices was conducted among 195 Low level final year students at Musoma Clinical Assistants School, Tarime and Geita Nursing Schools. The study investigated the incentive (attributes) package that attracts low level trained health workers in rural areas. A multivariate binary logit model was used to estimate the extent to which Low level trained health workers were willing to tradeoff between the five job attributes (net monthly pay, provision of basic housing, opportunities to upgrade their qualifications, availability of medicines and other supplies and good leadership and management) and the selection of either rural or urban job. Most Low Level Trained Health workers‟ were willing to tradeoff job attributes in favor of provision of <b>upgrading</b> <b>training</b> in exchange of a rural job, OR= 0. 83 (0. 7 - 11), with P value = 0. 037, had statistically significant influence on Low Level trained health workers‟ preferences.

Ranking of the attributes by using simple ordering and the DCE models, ware not statistically different, P-values = 1. 573. Provision of <b>upgrading</b> <b>training</b> is more likely to attract to Low Level health workers to work in rural areas. However combining provision of training with increase in net monthly pay and/ or availability of medicines can enhance the chances of low level health workers tochoose a rural job...|$|E

40|$|The US Air Force {{recently}} awarded CTSS contracts under FAR Part 12 {{for flight}} simulator training for F- 15 and F- 16 pilots and AWACS combat crewmembers using contractor-owned training systems. Under CTSS, the contractors invest up-front to deploy the training systems and are paid monthly {{for the number}} of hours that these systems are available for training. The contractors are expected to amortize their up-front investment over the initial years of the contract and to upgrade and support the training systems for up to fifteen years. The concept of CTSS was developed for the Air Force’s Distributed Mission Training (DMT) program. DMT is a training philosophy that focuses on creating distributed virtual environments (DVE’s) at Air Force combat wings around the world. These DVE’s enable the diverse elements of the aerial warfare team to train together at home station through local and wide area networks. The CTSS approach is designed to establish long-term relationships with contractors, which the Government believes will result in better training, reduced government oversight, and more flexibility in fielding and <b>upgrading</b> <b>training</b> systems. CTSS contractors are faced with new challenges in funding and selling this acquisition strategy to their shareholders. The large up-front investment needed to deploy the training systems, the length of time required to recover the investment, and the uncertainty of the annual funding that sustains service contracts poses significant business challenges.

The paper is based on a study which centred on the Asian Foundation/UNDP Jua Kali Project on the past and present skill <b>upgrading</b> <b>training</b> for the entrepreneurs in Nairobi Kenya. The study adopted a descriptive survey design. The author used simple random sampling technique to select a sample of 45 respondents for the study. Forty-five semi-structured questionnaire were administered to these respondents out of which 40 were returned constituting a response rate of 89 per cent. Quantitative analysis using descriptive statistics was used to describe distribution of findings. Findings indicated that most of the respondents were between the age group 20 - 25 with an average of 23 years. The majorities were not married constituting 75 per cent. The education levels of business owners in the sampled enterprises were high with 47. 5 per cent of all business owners having passed secondary school while 25 per cent had had college education. In addition, majority of the respondents had work experience of less than 5 year because many joined the training programme from secondary schools. Forty-five per-cent of the respondents had had previous technical training with a number of entrepreneurs critical of the training they had received terming the courses as too basic, too theoretical or too general. The enterprises encountered in the field ranged from metal work, screen printing, herbal soap, disinfectants, detergents, weaving/tie and dye. The most preferred measure of enterprise performance was profit. This was followed by sales volume and also income. Recommendations were based on ensuring access to credit after skills acquisition, regularly reviewing and reformulating the curriculum {{to keep pace with the}} rapid change in technological and market demands, focus on wholesome all round skills acquisition including personal, Managerial, and enterprise skills and training be done by successful entrepreneurs or owner/managers with business experience...|$|E
40|$|Work to help {{communities}} prevent suicide {{has taken a}} further step forward with over 50 ASIST Trainers from across Northern Ireland completing the new ASIST 11 upgrader trainer course. The Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) enables people {{in a position of}} trust to recognise risk and learn how to intervene to prevent the immediate risk of suicide. The Public Health Agency (PHA) funded the <b>upgrading</b> <b>training</b> as part of their ongoing commitment to supporting quality training for a range of individuals, communities and organisations. Madeline Heaney, the PHA 2 ̆ 7 s strategic lead for Suicide Prevention, explained: "This programme enables people who have been trained to become more willing, ready and able to help those at risk of suicide, which can be vital in a crisis situation. �"We want to empower people who are in position of responsibility and care {{to know what to do}} if they find themselves in a situation where someone is at risk of taking their own lives. "�ASIST has been delivered in Northern Ireland since 2003 and the course is designed for all caregivers or any person in a position of trust, making it useful for a range of people. The training is suitable for mental health professionals, nurses, doctors, pharmacists, teachers, counsellors, youth workers, police and prison staff, school support staff, clergy, community volunteers and the general public. This most recent training, which ASIST Trainers must complete, builds on previous editions and offers advances that help meet current challenges and provides new opportunities in helping to reduce suicides within communities.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the school leadership effectiveness in implementing school improvement programs in secondary schools of Ilubabor Zone. In this study descriptive survey design was used with both quantitative and qualitative methods. Among the 24 government secondary schools found in the Zone, 8 (35 %) was taken as a sample by using multistage sampling technique. The sample teachers 164 (58 %) were selected by using multistage sampling techniques. Additionally, 8 secondary school external supervisors, 8 school principals and 8 vice principals were selected by available sampling techniques. Finally, 8 PTA representatives were included by using purposive sampling techniques. The instruments of data collection were questionnaires, semi structured interview, observation and document analysis. The data were analyzed by using frequency, percentages, mean and standard deviation. The data gathered through open –ended questions, interviews, observation and document analysis were analyzed qualitatively through narration for the purpose of triangulation. The findings of the study indicated low performance of secondary school leaders in implementing school improvement program domain such as, school leadership and community participation. They also had low performance in the preparation stage of SIP. As the finding of the study revealed the domains, secondary school leaders of Ilubabor Zone did at an average level were ‘teaching and learning’ and ‘safe and healthy school environment’. Thus, secondary school leaders were not adequately preparing themselves and other responsible stakeholders with important financial and material resources before implementation of SIP and these problems in turn affected the implementation of SIP in the secondary schools of the zone. Regarding challenges, inadequate financial resources, inadequate man power in the schools, insufficient and inconsistent communication among leaders and the staff, low level of commitment of school leaders, low support from parents and community, lack of technical skills in school improvement program preparation, scarcity of frameworks and guidelines of SIP in schools were some of the challenges of secondary school leaders in implementing SIP. In general, as the finding of the study revealed secondary school leaders of Ilubabor zone were not effective in implementing some domains of school improvement program. Therefore, it is recommended that Wored education Offices in collaboration with Zone Education Offices and Regional Education Bureau should give sustainable technical assistance including training for school leaders. Woreda education offices in collaboration with school leaders need to enhance community participation. Finally, the REB is advised to promote and sustain the <b>upgrading</b> <b>training</b> system of secondary school leaders to capacitate them with adequate technical and administrative skills.
