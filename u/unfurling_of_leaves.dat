5|$|Temperate sundews: These species form a tight cluster <b>of</b> <b>unfurled</b> <b>leaves</b> {{called a}} hibernaculum in a winter {{dormancy}} period (= Hemicryptophyte). All of the North American and European species belong to this group. Drosera arcturi from Australia (including Tasmania) and New Zealand is another temperate species that dies {{back to a}} horn-shaped hibernaculum.|$|R
50|$|The typical Xanthosoma {{plant has}} a growing cycle of 9 to 11 months, {{during which time}} it {{produces}} a large stem called a corm, this surrounded by smaller edible cormels {{about the size of}} potatoes. These cormels (like the corm) are rich in starch. Their taste has been described as earthy and nutty, and they are a common ingredient in soups and stews. They may also be eaten grilled, fried, or puréed. The young, <b>unfurled</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> some varieties can be eaten as boiled leafy vegetables or used in soups and stews, such as the Caribbean callaloo. Flour made from Xanthosoma species is hypoallergenic.|$|R
50|$|The bats {{are named}} for their habit of {{roosting}} in the <b>unfurled,</b> tube-like <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> banana trees and related {{plants such as}} plantains. However, they also roost {{in a variety of}} other trees with similarly shaped leaves, such as Strelitzia nicolai and sugar plum, as well as in palms, culverts, and holes in buildings. While roosting, at least some banana pipistrelles enter daily torpor during cool weather. Many bats roost alone or in pairs, although colonies of up to 150 individuals are known. Males have been reported to defend particular roosting sites, whereas females regularly travel between different locations, and therefore show no fidelity to particular mating partners.|$|R

5000|$|Heliconias provide {{shelter for}} a {{diverse range of}} insects within their young rolled leaves and water-filled floral bracts. Insects that inhabit the rolled leaves often feed upon the inner {{surfaces}} of the leaf, such as beetles of the family Chrysomelidae. In bracts containing small amounts of water, fly larvae and beetles are the dominant inhabitants. In bracts with greater quantities of water the typical inhabitants are mosquito larva. Insects living in the bracts often feed on the bract tissue, nectar of the flower, flower parts, other insects, microorganisms, or detritus in the water contained in the bract (Siefert 1982). Almost all species of Hispini beetles that use rolled leaves are obligate herbivores of plants {{of the order of}} Zingiberales, which includes Heliconia. These beetles live in and feed from the rolled leaf, the stems, the inflorescences, or the <b>unfurled</b> mature <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> the Heliconia plant. In addition, these beetles deposit their eggs on the leaf surface, petioles <b>of</b> immature <b>leaves,</b> or in the bracts of the Heliconia. [...] Furthermore, some wasp species such as Polistes erythrocephalus build their nest on the protected underside <b>of</b> large <b>leaves.</b>|$|R

50|$|Day 6 {{continued}} {{the installation of}} the solar array. The <b>unfurling</b> <b>of</b> the solar panels themselves began a little behind schedule due to the problem encountered on Day 5 with SARJ. This problem was determined to be in the software, and a workaround was developed. The <b>unfurling</b> <b>of</b> the panels continued throughout the morning in stages to prevent the panels sticking, as they did during STS-97. It was noted by the crew that some panels were still sticking together, but this didn't cause any problems. Although the installation has been completed, the solar arrays will not provide power to the station until the next shuttle mission, STS-116, scheduled for December 2006, when the station will undergo a major electrical system rewiring.|$|R
40|$|Foliar {{analyses}} {{are used in}} the Swaziland sugar industry to monitor nutrient uptake in the young crop and to ensure that the prescribed fertiliser strategy is satisfactory. Current fertiliser recommendations are based on norms developed for variety NCo 376, reflecting the widespread cultivation of this variety in the industry. Separate P and K leaf thresholds are used for variety N 14. Concentrations of N, P and K in the third fully <b>unfurled</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> NCo 376 were compared with those of varieties N 14, N 19, N 23, N 24 and N 25 in a series of replicated field trials in Swaziland. Foliar levels of K were higher in all of the newer varieties than in NCo 376, while levels of N and P were lower. Most varietal differences were small and insignificant, with the exception of leaf nitrogen in N 19, leaf phosphorus in N 14, and leaf potassium in N 14, N 23 and N 25. Levels of P and K were lower in N 14 than in NCo 376, supporting the current use of lower leaf thresholds. The results indicate that leaf K thresholds specific to N 23 and N 25 will be necessary when these varieties become popular. Correction factors to adjust threshold values developed for NCo 376 have been proposed for varieties N 19, N 23 and N 25 as an interim measure...|$|R
