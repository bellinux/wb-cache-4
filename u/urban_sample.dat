30|$|The {{detection}} of PAHs in both sediment samples indicated that beach sands are a possible sink for such hydrophobic chemicals. The occurrence of PAHs in both samples must be due primarily to atmospheric deposition because samples {{were taken from}} areas {{that had not been}} flooded for some time. Possible PAH emission sources are car and truck traffic, industrial activities using fuel oils and the combustion of coal/coke (iron and steel industries). In addition, aerosols from the sea may also contribute to the PAH burden in beach sands, especially following stormy weather, as hydrophobic compounds accumulate at the surface, albeit to a lesser extent [26]. The sum of PAH concentrations in the <b>urban</b> <b>sample</b> (Marseille) was within the lower range found in immersed sediments from Marseille Bay, France [7] and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania [3], but higher than in coastal sediments from Togo [5]. In the study by Benlahcen et al. [6], the sum of PAHs was usually higher in Mediterranean coastal sediments than that found in the <b>urban</b> <b>sample</b> of the present study.|$|E
40|$|Eating {{disorders}} {{were first}} described in black females in South Africa in 1995. A subsequent community based study of eating attitudes amongst adolescent females {{in an urban}} setting suggested {{that there would be}} increasing numbers of sufferers from within the black community. The current study sought to extend these findings using a larger, more representative <b>urban</b> <b>sample.</b> The results support those of the preliminary study. The underlying basis for the emerging phenomenon is discusse...|$|E

The specific aims of the study were: (a) ascertain whether Chinese urban residents are satisfied with their lives; (b) validate the PWI using an <b>urban</b> <b>sample</b> that is representative of the urban population and larger in size than that which has been utilized in existing studie...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between migration and employment in Ouagadougou. Using both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal approach, we compare the economic integration of migrants to that of non-migrants. Contrary to most studies based on <b>urban</b> <b>samples,</b> the data used here come from a national survey. It is thus possible to reintegrate into the analysis the migration episodes to Ouagadougou of those respondents elsewhere in Burkina Faso. Results indicate that, contrary to the dominant hypothesis, {{with the introduction of}} time-dependent variables, migrants are not more disadvantaged than non-migrants in the labour market, whether we consider the situation {{at the time of the}} survey or at their time of arrival in the city hunting for their first paid job. Burkina Faso, employment, migration, urban...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} the present work was to assess the {{mutagenic}} potency of soil samples presumably not contaminated by industrial wastes and discharges. A set of 51 soil samples was collected from areas considered as not contaminated by a known industrial activity: 11 <b>urban</b> <b>samples</b> (collected in cities), 15 suburban samples (collected in villages), 7 agricultural samples, and 18 forest or natural samples. Each soil sample was collected at the surface (0 - 5 cm deep), dried, sieved (2 mm), homogenized before organic extraction (dichloromethane/acetone 1 / 1 (v/v), 37 degrees C, 4 h, soil/solvent ratio 1 / 2, m/v), solvent exchange to DMSO and sterilizing flltration. The micro-method adaptation of the standard bacterial mutagenicity test on Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 98 was performed with and without a metabolic activation system (rat-liver homogenate S 9), and thus detected the effect of pro-mutagens and direct mutagens, respectively. The use of a pre-incubation method increased the sensitivity of the assay. The results obtained showed a wide range of effect levels, from no effect to clear mutagenicity. in particular, the extract of all 11 <b>urban</b> soil <b>samples</b> demonstrated mutagenic activity, while the extracts of 10 of the 15 suburban samples showed mutagenicity. On the other hand, the extract of only one of the 7 agricultural samples studied induced mutations, and none of the 18 natural or forest-soil samples investigated produced mutagenic extracts. These findings seem to indicate the crucial influence of the diffuse pollution originating from different human activities on the mutagenic potency of <b>urban</b> soil <b>samples.</b> These findings make it possible to classify the soils according to their mutagenic potency. No clear correlation was found between the mutagenicity detected in soil extracts and the measured polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content of the soils investigated...|$|R
