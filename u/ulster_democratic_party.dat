25|$|Following White's {{release from}} the Maze Prison in 1992, he joined the <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> A {{prominent}} figure in the Northern Ireland Peace Process, in 1996 he comprised part of a four-man loyalist delegation to 10 Downing Street where he met British Prime Minister John Major.|$|E
25|$|On 28 August 1996, the UDA's South Belfast Brigadier Alex Kerr, {{and head}} of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade Billy Wright, were {{expelled}} from the Combined Loyalist Military Command and ordered to leave Northern Ireland after the pair had lent their support to a campaign against the Belfast Agreement in general and the Progressive Unionist Party and <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> in particular. The campaign was being led by former UDA hitman and Ulster Independence Movement member Pastor Kenny McClinton.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, the ULDP {{changed its}} name to the <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (UDP). It finally {{dissolved}} itself in 2001 following very limited electoral success and internal difficulties. Gary McMichael, son of John McMichael, was the last leader of the UDP, which supported the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. The Ulster Political Research Group (UPRG) was subsequently formed to give political analysis to the UDA and act as community workers in loyalist areas. It is currently represented on the Belfast City Council.|$|E
50|$|Since the <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party's</b> {{dissolution}} in 2001, the PUP {{has been}} the sole party in Northern Ireland representing paramilitary loyalism.|$|R
5000|$|Kenneth Jason Kerr, {{known as}} [...] "Ken", is a Northern Irish loyalist activist. He {{was a leading}} figure within the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and its {{political}} wing, the <b>Ulster</b> Loyalist <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> He was also central {{to a series of}} allegations regarding collusion between the British security forces and loyalist paramilitaries.|$|R
5000|$|Several other {{candidates}} stood. John McMichael represented the <b>Ulster</b> Loyalist <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> {{linked to the}} paramilitary Ulster Defence Association {{on a platform of}} Ulster nationalism. Jagat Narain, possibly the first non-white candidate in an election in Northern Ireland, stood as [...] "One Human Family", while Simon Hall-Raleigh stood as [...] "Peace State".|$|R
2500|$|... 2 January 1990: Ulster loyalist Harry Dickey, {{a member}} of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> was killed by a Provisional IRA booby trap bomb {{attached}} to his car outside his home, Larkfield Manor, Sydenham, East Belfast.|$|E
2500|$|... 9 August 1991: <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> {{member and}} UDA/UFF member Gary Lynch {{was shot dead}} by the IRA in Lisahally, County Londonderry. Lynch had been a pall bearer at the funeral of senior UDP and UDA/UFF member Cecil McKnight who was shot dead by the IRA two months earlier.|$|E
2500|$|... 29 June 1991: <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> {{member and}} UDA/UFF {{commander}} Cecil McKnight {{was shot dead}} by the IRA in the Waterside area of Derry City. The IRA claimed he {{had been involved in}} the assassination of Sinn Féin Councillor Eddie Fullerton. The IRA unit were pursued by the RUC after the shooting but escaped after they opened fire on an RUC patrol car.|$|E
50|$|The group fielded three {{candidates}} in the 1981 local elections, {{with one of them}} holding the seat that he had won in a by-election three months before the local elections. However the NUPRG were disbanded soon afterwards and replaced with the <b>Ulster</b> Loyalist <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> a group that took Beyond the Religious Divide as the basis of its ideology.|$|R
25|$|The New Ulster Political Research Group (NUPRG) was {{initially}} the political {{wing of the}} UDA, founded in 1978, which then evolved into the <b>Ulster</b> Loyalist <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> in 1981 {{under the leadership of}} John McMichael, a prominent UDA member killed by the IRA in 1987, amid suspicion that he was set up to be killed by some of his UDA colleagues.|$|R
50|$|He ran as the <b>Ulster</b> Loyalist <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (ULDP) {{candidate}} in the August 1981 council by-elections. Although he was not elected, he garnered more than one thousand votes, 38 per cent of the total votes cast, against stalwart Ulster Unionist <b>Party</b> (UUP) and <b>Democratic</b> Unionist <b>Party</b> (DUP) candidates. The ULDP, a loyalist party founded in June 1981 by the UDA, was led by the high-profile South Belfast brigadier, John McMichael.|$|R
2500|$|... 11 July 1994: {{a member}} of the <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> Ray Smallwoods, was shot dead by the IRA in Lisburn. A five-member IRA unit {{consisting}} of four men and one woman took over a nearby house the night before. As he left his home the next morning one IRA volunteer ran down the street and blasted him several times with a shotgun. Smallwoods was a leading member of the UDA and was one of those involved in the unsuccessful assassination attempts on the lives of Bernadette and Michael McAliskey.|$|E
2500|$|The killings deeply {{shocked the}} {{community}} and were strongly condemned by local politicians. [...] "The Spot"'s then manager, Willie Frazer also condemned the killings. The young men's funerals attracted hundreds of mourners; they were buried in adjacent graves at Kernan Cemetery in Portadown. <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> representative John White and Johnny Adair, the Ulster Defence Association's (UDA) [...] "C Company" [...] West Belfast Brigade commander both attended Robb's funeral, whereas Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) assemblyman Paul Berry and Richard Jameson's brother Bobby attended McIlwaine's. After the attacks Adair branded the UVF [...] "Protestant killers" [...] and even produced a news-sheet in which he listed McIlwaine and Robb as Protestant victims of the UVF along {{with the likes of}} the murdered Frankie Curry and regular targets Jackie Mahood, Kenny McClinton and Clifford Peeples.|$|E
2500|$|Curry's death saw {{an angry}} {{reaction}} {{from both the}} UDA's C Company on the Shankill and the LVF, with a death threat issued against McDonald and Cusack by LVF associate Jackie Mahood and his dissident UDA allies due to their reporting of Curry's involvement in bomb-making, an issue that his loyalist supporters felt was the crucial factor {{in the decision to}} kill Curry. For its part, the Red Hand Defenders issued a statement which blamed the killing on the UVF and threatened retaliation, although Gusty Spence, by then a leading figure in the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), quickly denied the claims that it was a UVF attack, a sentiment echoed by PUP leader David Ervine. The killing was also condemned by <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> activist John White who said [...] "it's disgraceful that a man who dedicated his life to the loyalist cause should be cut down like this by people who call themselves loyalists". Curry was close to White and had hoped to see him on the day of his killing in order that White might help him with some job applications.|$|E
40|$|Title {{devised by}} cataloguer.; Published in the Canberra Times on 24 November 1981; Part of the Pryor {{collection}} of cartoons and drawings. The Reverend Ian Paisley, the hardline {{leader of the}} <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> Union <b>Party,</b> threatens a day of action which will involve a twelve hour strike, marches and the closing of shops and factories. "I will make this country ungovernable", he boasts, a little redundantly. [...] Information provided by Geoff Pryor...|$|R
50|$|After the 2010 census, Gibson's {{district}} was renumbered as the 19th district. It {{lost most of}} its northern portion, including Glens Falls, Saratoga Springs and Lake Placid. Gibson defeated former federal prosecutor and <b>Ulster</b> County <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> chairman, Julian Schreibman. Gibson was endorsed by all the major newspapers in the district, including the Albany Times Union, the Kingston Daily Freeman, the Poughkeepsie Journal, and the Oneonta Daily Star.|$|R
50|$|The UDA, however, {{failed to}} {{recommend}} the proposals to its members and, as a result, Barr drifted {{away from the}} NUPRG, leaving politics altogether in 1981 to return to community work in Derry. Barr also had a somewhat fractious relationship with the NUPRG's chairman John McMichael and following Barr's retirement McMichael changed the group, abandoning Barr's pet project of establishing a cross-community Northern Ireland Negotiated Independence Association, and instead set up the <b>Ulster</b> Loyalist <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the killing}} of Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) leader Billy Wright by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) inside the Maze Prison in December 1997, Adair, who was a strong admirer of [...] "King Rat", told McKeag that he had carte blanche to avenge the murder. McKeag did so on 28 December {{when he entered the}} Clifton Tavern in north Belfast and opened fire with an Uzi, killing Edmund Trainor and {{injuring}} a number of others. On 23 January 1998 he was also involved in {{the killing of}} Liam Conway on north Belfast's Hesketh Road, although McKeag was brought before the Inner Council of the UDA for this attack as the movement had declared a ceasefire a few hours earlier. McKeag claimed that the attack was in response to the continuing activity of the INLA, and his fearsome reputation meant that the Inner Council would not reprimand him, even though the murder resulted in the <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> being excluded from all-party talks. By this time McKeag was effectively in command of C Company whilst Adair was in prison.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> {{which had}} succeeded the earlier Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party, {{dissolved}} in 2001 and the UPRG was re-established soon afterwards.|$|E
5000|$|... 11 July 1994- Ray Smallwoods (44) a Protestant former loyalist {{prisoner}} and <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> chairman {{was shot}} {{at his home in}} Donard Drive by the IRA.|$|E
50|$|In 1988 McMichael became {{involved}} with the <b>Ulster</b> Loyalist <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (as the UDP was then known). He served as election co-ordinator for the group and helped to ensure the election of Ken Kerr to Derry City Council in 1989. He was the UDP candidate in the 1990 Upper Bann by-election, when he finished eighth with 600 votes in a contest won by David Trimble. Although he regularly gave political advice to the UDA's controlling Inner Council, he was never {{a member of the}} paramilitary organisation, concentrating solely on the political wing.|$|R
5000|$|Republican Chris Gibson, who was redistricted {{from the}} 20th district, has {{represented}} that district since 2011. With redistricting settled, the new 19th district {{went from being}} a Republican-leaning district to being a swing district. [...] Because of the dissolution of Maurice Hinchey's district, much of that district, including all of Ulster and Sullivan counties, was dissolved into this new district. Ulster County Executive Mike Hein declined to seek the Democratic nomination. Former federal prosecutor and <b>Ulster</b> County <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> chairman, Julian Schreibman, sought the Democratic nomination. Joel Tyner, a member of the Dutchess County legislature, also sought the Democratic nomination to challenge Gibson. [...] Schreibman prevailed in the Democratic primary.|$|R
5000|$|Nowadays, {{as in the}} past, unionist {{movements}} {{exist in}} Scotland and Northern Ireland. These movements seek specifically to retain the ties between those areas {{and the rest of}} the UK, in opposition to civic nationalist movements. Such unionist movements include the <b>Ulster</b> Unionist <b>Party,</b> <b>Democratic</b> Unionist <b>Party</b> and the Scottish Unionist Party. In Scotland and Wales the Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, and [...] UKIP support the Union. British nationalists are generally supportive of unionism.|$|R

50|$|Monday 15 September 1997: Multi-Party Talks resumed. The Ulster Unionist Party, the Progressive Unionist Party, and the <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> instead {{attended}} a special {{meeting at the}} UUP headquarters, and re-entered the talks on Wednesday.|$|E
50|$|McMichael's eldest son, Gary, {{followed}} in his father's footsteps {{of trying to}} build up the <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> as a strong political wing for the UDA, but following the collapse of the party he dropped out of politics.|$|E
50|$|McMichael came {{to support}} the ideas of republican Danny Morrison {{regarding}} the Armalite and ballot box strategy and felt that the UDA should also build up a political wing to this end. As a result, following the murder of Robert Bradford, he stood as the <b>Ulster</b> Loyalist <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> candidate in the by-election for Bradford's South Belfast seat and ran the most high-profile ULDP campaign ever seen, calling for a long term strategy of negotiated independence for Northern Ireland. Despite fears from mainstream unionists that McMichael might split their vote, he ultimately only captured 576 votes. McMichael's failure to make any inroads into the popular vote led to the UDA largely abandoning electoral politics outside of the occasional local foray for over a decade.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his youth}} Kerr {{served in the}} British Army before joining the UDA. He served as Brigadier of the UDA's [...] "Londonderry and North Antrim Brigade", and as such {{was a member of}} the movement's Inner Council. In this role he succeeded Andy Robinson, who fled his {{position}} in 1986. Like South Belfast brigadier John McMichael, Kerr also became involved in the UDA's political arm, the <b>Ulster</b> Loyalist <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> and following the killing of McMichael in 1987, Kerr served for a time as chairman of the party. This role was soon filled on a more permanent basis by Ray Smallwoods. Kerr's reign had never been likely to last long as the brigade he commanded was one of the UDA's weakest and he was not personally popular within the movement.|$|R
50|$|The 1986 Northern Ireland by-elections were fifteen by-elections held on 23 January 1986, to fill {{vacancies}} in the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{caused by}} the resignation in December 1985 of all sitting Unionist Members of Parliament (MPs). The MPs, from the <b>Ulster</b> Unionist <b>Party,</b> <b>Democratic</b> Unionist <b>Party</b> and <b>Ulster</b> Popular Unionist Party, did this to highlight {{their opposition to the}} Anglo-Irish Agreement. Each of their parties agreed not to contest seats previously held by the others, and each outgoing MP stood for re-election.|$|R
50|$|On 24 April 2013, Frazer and others, {{including}} former British National Party fundraiser Jim Dowson and David Nicholl, {{a former member}} of the paramilitary-linked <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> announced the launch of a new political party called the Protestant Coalition.|$|E
5000|$|... 2 January 1990: Ulster loyalist Harry Dickey, {{a member}} of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and <b>Ulster</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> was killed by a Provisional IRA booby trap bomb {{attached}} to his car outside his home, Larkfield Manor, Sydenham, East Belfast.|$|E

50|$|The 1986 Belfast East {{by-election}} {{was one of}} {{the fifteen}} 1986 Northern Ireland by-elections held on 23 January 1986, to fill vacancies in the Parliament of the United Kingdom caused by the resignation in December 1985 of all sitting Unionist Members of Parliament (MPs). The MPs, from the <b>Ulster</b> Unionist <b>Party,</b> <b>Democratic</b> Unionist <b>Party</b> and <b>Ulster</b> Popular Unionist Party, did this to highlight their opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.

50|$|In October 2006 she was {{involved}} in a public row with Ian Paisley Jr. The incident happened in a Belfast coffee shop when Paisley was approached by O'Loan. She voiced her concerns on alleged comments made by Paisley about her children. Her marriage to a nationalist Social <b>Democratic</b> and Labour <b>Party</b> (SDLP) councillor has, in the past, caused Paisley to question her ability to remain independent. Upon her retirement, a farewell party was organised, to which all political parties were invited. However, no representatives from the <b>Ulster</b> Unionist <b>Party,</b> <b>Democratic</b> Unionist <b>Party</b> or Sinn Féin attended. In August 2008 O'Loan while being interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour caused controversy by reportedly claiming that Protestants in Northern Ireland were brought up not to trust Catholics.|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of his}} {{political}} strategy Tyrie became close to South Belfast brigadier John McMichael and supported his development of the <b>Ulster</b> Loyalist <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> along <b>Ulster</b> nationalist lines. He had previously written in a UDA publication in the late 1970s that an independent Northern Ireland could [...] "take its rightful {{place in the world}} and not be seen as a country with a death-wish", after becoming disillusioned with what he saw as the British government's lack of commitment to Northern Ireland. Tyrie shunned the limelight and as a consequence he appointed McMichael as official spokesman for, and thus the public face of, the UDA. However, McMichael's assassination by the IRA in December 1987 and his replacement in the party by the less well-known Ray Smallwoods placed some doubts upon the political strategy that Tyrie had long advocated. Furthermore, resentment among UDA hardliners had been growing and they came to feel that Tyrie's leadership was too much about politics and not enough about military action. Tyrie was also criticised for what his internal opponents felt was a tendency towards cronyism, with the late 1980s seeing responsibility and position being given to internally unpopular figures like Jackie McDonald and Eddie Sayers, seemingly because they were personally close to Tyrie.|$|R
