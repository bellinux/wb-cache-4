5|$|Warfarin {{interacts with}} many {{commonly}} <b>used</b> <b>drugs,</b> and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients. Some foods {{have also been}} reported to interact with warfarin. Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from serum albumin and cause {{an increase in the}} INR. This makes finding the correct dosage difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when initiating a medication that is known to interact with warfarin (e.g. simvastatin), INR checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{resistance}} {{occurs when}} a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently <b>used</b> <b>drugs.</b> It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{depends on}} the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used. Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, topotecan, and irinotecan are also used. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> are gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, etoposide or vinorelbine.|$|E

5|$|Some {{of the men}} who {{purchased}} {{sex with}} Falle were police officers, and she knew girls who <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> with their drug counselors. Falle was brainwashed to believe that her only worth lay in prostitution, which she later said was why it took her so long to exit prostitution. While engaging in prostitution, Falle was frequently threatened by other women in the sex industry, she was verbally abused by her clients, she was stalked, and she was threatened with guns on multiple occasions, including by her pimp. She was also drugged several times, and was once sexually assaulted by an escort driver after having been drugged by him. At one point, she was kidnapped. She had to resort to pulling a knife on people at times when she was threatened with violence. Because of various instances of violence during her time in prostitution, Falle was injured in a variety of ways. Her pimp broke several of her bones and burned her body.|$|E

40|$|Pregnant {{women who}} <b>use</b> <b>drugs</b> {{are more likely}} to receive little or no {{prenatal}} care. This study sought to understand how <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and factors associated with <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> influence women’s prenatal care use. A total of 20 semi-structured interviews and 2 focus groups were conducted with a racially/ethnically diverse sample of low-income women <b>using</b> alcohol and <b>drugs</b> in a California county. Women <b>using</b> <b>drugs</b> attend and avoid prenatal care for reasons not connected to their drug use: concern for the health of their baby, social support, and extrinsic barriers such as health insurance and transportation. <b>Drug</b> <b>use</b> itself is a barrier for a few women. In addition to <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> women experience multiple simultaneous risk factors. Both the <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and the multiple simultaneous risk factors make resolving extrinsic barriers more difficult. Women also fear the effects of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> on their baby’s health and fear being reported to Child Protective Services, each of which influence women’s prenatal care use. Increasing the number of pregnant women who <b>use</b> <b>drugs</b> who receive prenatal care requires systems-level rather than only individual-level changes. These changes require a paradigm shift to viewing <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> in context of the person and society and acceptance of responsibility for unintended consequences of public health bureaucratic procedures and messages about effects of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> during pregnancy...|$|R

25|$|A {{large number}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} contain halogens, especially fluorine. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several {{of the most widely}} <b>used</b> <b>drugs.</b> Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E

25|$|The {{serotonin}} neurotransmitter has {{the ability}} to mediate synaptic transmission through either GPCR's or LGIC receptors.

The most popular and widely <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> in the regulation of serotonin during depression are known as SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These drugs inhibit the transport of serotonin back into the pre-synaptic neuron, leaving more serotonin in the synaptic gap to be used.|$|E
