5|$|The {{game is a}} {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Drakengard series, and follows the fifth ending of the first game, the events of which have left the planet Earth {{in a state of}} decay. Set over one thousand years after this, the game puts the player in control of the titular protagonist Nier, as he attempts to find a cure for an illness, known as the Black Scrawl, to which his daughter Yonah has succumbed. Partnering with a talking book known as Grimoire Weiss, he journeys with two other characters, Kainé and Emil, as he attempts to find a remedy and <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the creatures known as Shades that stalk the world. The gameplay borrows elements from various video game genres, occasionally switching between them and the main role-playing-based gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{motivation for}} research {{investigations of the}} rhodocene system was to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of and bonding within the metallocene class of compounds. In more recent times, interest has been rekindled {{by the desire to}} explore and apply the metal–metal interactions that occur when metallocene systems are linked. Potential applications for such systems include molecular electronics, semi-conducting (and possibly ferromagnetic) metallocene polymers (an example of a molecular wire), and exploring the threshold between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Examples of known bimetallocenes and termetallocenes that possess the rhodocenyl moiety include the hexafluorophosphate salts of rhodocenylferrocene, 1,1'-dirhodocenylferrocene, and 1-cobaltocenyl-1'-rhodocenylferrocene, each shown at right. Linked metallocenes can also be formed by introducing several metallocenyl substituents onto a single cyclopentadienyl ligand.|$|E

5|$|Duchesne {{now called}} on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd {{to counter the}} defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb had {{suddenly}} abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane {{and said that he}} was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has emerged}} as a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology, which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests. However, there are strong indications the theory is incomplete. The problem of quantum gravity and the question of the reality of spacetime singularities remain open. Observational data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physics. Even taken as is, general relativity is rich with possibilities for further exploration. Mathematical relativists seek to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of singularities and the fundamental properties of Einstein's equations, while numerical relativists run increasingly powerful computer simulations (such as those describing merging black holes). In February 2016, it was announced that the existence of gravitational waves was directly detected by the Advanced LIGO team on September 14, 2015. A century after its introduction, general relativity remains a highly active area of research.|$|E

Clinical and research psychiatrists study basic and clinical psychiatric topics at research institutions and publish articles in journals. Under the supervision of institutional review boards, psychiatric clinical researchers look at topics such as neuroimaging, genetics, and psychopharmacology {{in order to enhance}} diagnostic validity and reliability, to discover new treatment methods, and to classify new mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|While {{the idea}} of shared {{electron}} pairs provides an effective qualitative picture of covalent bonding, quantum mechanics is needed to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of these bonds and predict the structures and properties of simple molecules. Walter Heitler and Fritz London are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation of a chemical bond (molecular hydrogen) in 1927. Their work {{was based on the}} valence bond model, which assumes that a chemical bond is formed when there is good overlap between the atomic orbitals of participating atoms.|$|E
25|$|The Greek {{philosophers}} {{were the}} earliest Western thinkers to address chance and randomness. Around 400 BC, Democritus presented {{a view of}} the world as governed by the unambiguous laws of order and considered randomness as a subjective concept that only originated from the inability of humans to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of events. He used the example of two men who would send their servants to bring water {{at the same time to}} cause them to meet. The servants, unaware of the plan, would view the meeting as random.|$|E

25|$|A {{referring}} expression (RE), in linguistics, is any noun phrase, or {{surrogate for}} a noun phrase, whose function in discourse {{is to identify}} some individual object (thing, being, event...) The technical terminology for identify differs {{a great deal from}} one school of linguistics to another. The most widespread term is probably refer, and a thing identified is a referent, as for example in the work of John Lyons. In linguistics, the study of reference relations belongs to pragmatics, the study of language use, though it is also a matter of great interest to philosophers, especially those wishing to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of knowledge, perception and cognition more generally.|$|E
25|$|Mesons are the {{associated}} quantum-field particles that transmit the nuclear force between hadrons that pull those {{together into a}} nucleus. Their effect is analogous to photons that are the force carriers that transmit the electromagnetic force of attraction between oppositely charged protons and electrons that allow individual atoms to exist, and further, to pull atoms together into molecules. Higher energy (more massive) mesons were created momentarily in the Big Bang, but are not thought {{to play a role}} in nature today. However, such heavy mesons are regularly created in particle accelerator experiments, in order to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the heavier types of quark that compose the heavier mesons.|$|E
25|$|Religious persons acquire {{religious}} {{ideas and}} practices through social exposure. The {{child of a}} Zen Buddhist will not become an evangelical Christian or a Zulu warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a Roman Catholic but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required – this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of thin air. Boyer says cognitive science can help us to understand the psychological mechanisms that account for these manifest correlations {{and in so doing}} enable us to better <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of religious belief and practice.|$|E
