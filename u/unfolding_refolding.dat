40|$|The nonreducing {{disaccharide}} trehalose {{has been}} long considered {{only as a}} reserve carbohydrate. However, recent studies in yeast suggested that this osmolyte can protect cells and cellular proteins from oxidative damage elicited by exogenously added reactive oxygen species (ROS). Trehalose has been also shown to affect stability, folding and aggregation of bacterial and firefly proteins heterologously expressed in heat-shocked yeast cells. Our recent investigation of how a lifespan-extending caloric restriction (CR) diet alters the metabolic history of chronologically aging yeast suggested that their longevity is programmed by the level of metabolic capacity - including trehalose biosynthesis and degradation - that yeast cells developed prior to entry into quiescence. To investigate whether trehalose homeostasis in chronologically aging yeast {{may play a role}} in longevity extension by CR, in this study we examined how single-gene-deletion mutations affecting trehalose biosynthesis and degradation impact 1) the age-related dynamics of changes in trehalose concentration; 2) yeast chronological lifespan under CR conditions; 3) the chronology of oxidative protein damage, intracellular ROS level and protein aggregation; and 4) the timeline of thermal inactivation of a protein in heat-shocked yeast cells and its subsequent reactivation in yeast returned to low temperature. Our data imply that CR extends yeast chronological lifespan in part by altering a pattern of age-related changes in trehalose concentration.

40|$|Mechanical <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> {{of single}} RNA {{molecules}} have previously {{been observed in}} optical traps as sudden changes in molecular extension. Two methods have been traditionally used: “force-ramp”, with the applied force continuously changing, and “hopping”. In hopping experiments the force is held constant and the molecule jumps spontaneously between two different states. Unfolding/refolding rates are measured directly, but only over a very narrow range of forces. We have now developed a force-jump method to measure the <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> rates independently over {{a wider range of}} forces. In this method, the applied force is rapidly stepped to a new value and either the <b>unfolding</b> or <b>refolding</b> event is monitored through changes in the molecular extension. The force-jump technique is compared to the force-ramp and hopping methods by using a 52 -nucleotide RNA hairpin with a three-nucleotide bulge, i. e., the transactivation response region RNA from the human immunodeficiency virus. We find the unfolding kinetics and Gibbs free energies obtained from all three methods to be in good agreement. The transactivation response region RNA hairpin unfolds in an all-or-none two-state reaction at any loading rate with the force-ramp method. The unfolding reaction is reversible at small loading rates, but shows hysteresis at higher loading rates. Although the RNA <b>unfolds</b> and <b>refolds</b> without detectable intermediates in constant-force conditions (hopping and force-jump), it shows partially folded intermediates in force-ramp experiments at higher unloading rates. Thus, we find that folding of RNA hairpins can be more complex than a simple single-step reaction, and that application of several methods can improve understanding of reaction mechanisms...|$|R

Both proteins {{have been the subject of}} atomic force microscopy (AFM), laser tweezer, and other in vitro methods for examining the effects of force extension on the globular (FNIII/Ig-like) domains that comprise each protein. In this report we present a time-dependent method for simulating AFM force extension and its effect on FNIII/Ig domain <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding.</b> This method treats the <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> process as a standard three-state protein folding model (U ⇆ T ⇆ F, where U is the unfolded state, T is the transition or intermediate state, and F is the fully folded state), and integrates this approach within the wormlike chain (WLC) concept.

In general, we find that the use of a three-state protein-folding kinetic-based model and the implicit inclusion of PEVK domains can accurately reproduce the experimental force-extension curves observed for both titin and tenascin proteins. Furthermore, our simulation data indicate that PEVK domains exhibit extensibility behavior, assist in the <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> of FNIII/Ig domains in the titin molecule, and act as a force “buffer” for the FNIII/Ig domains, particularly at low and moderate extension forces...|$|R

In the first part, preliminary ¹H experiments were conducted on samples that had been freshly dissolved in 10 %D₂O / 90 %H₂O and spiked with acetonitrile as reference. The samples were encouraged to unfold and refold by ramping {{the temperature of the}} NMR probe, yielding real-time spectra that reflected changes of structure. NMR experiments were also performed on lysozyme that had been labeled along the surface with isotopically enriched ¹³C-methyl groups. This strategy, which promoted carbon observation at sensitivities approaching that of many homonuclear ¹H experiments, facilitated the investigation of heteronuclear Nuclear Overhauser effects, spin-lattice (T₁) and spin-spin (T₂) ¹³C relaxation times in the modified protein. Furthermore, the thermal gelation of egg-white lysozyme was monitored in solution containing different amounts of vitamin B₁ as model incipient. Protein incubated with moderate amounts of vitamin B₁, an established enzyme cofactor, showed higher tolerance to the denaturing effects of elevated temperature. In comparison, MD simulations were used to characterize the global changes of protein structure upon thermal treatment and served as a knowledge base to carry out subsequent NMR backbone dynamics studies.

The {{focus of the}} present thesis is on theoretical analysis to understand the experimental results from three quite different systems - enzymes, RNA hairpins and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Some experiments on single enzymes showed very unusual data: in separate experiments the fluctuations in catalysis rate ([ [...] . ]) and fluorescence lifetime ([ [...] . ]) of chromophore in single enzymes showed long-lasting autocorrelations, represented by a stretched exponential and power-law, respectively. With the aim of interpreting the origin of these fluctuations, we proposed a formulation based on fluctuations in electrostatic interaction energy ([ [...] . ]) at the active site in the enzyme leading to the fluctuations in the various observables. We developed relations between the autocorrelation functions of [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ], spectral diffusion ([ [...] . ]) and the radiative component of fluorescence lifetime ([ [...] . ]). It was {{pointed out that the}} relation between [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ], seen experimentally and modeled theoretically by using the relation noted above, is a dynamic analog of the solvatochromism concept used in the catalysis of organic reactions by solvent. The estimation of fluctuations in electrostatic interactions on the milliseconds to seconds time scale by computational methods is not possible, which are typically limited to tens of nanoseconds. To calculate the autocorrelation of electrostatic interactions and to compare them with experiments, we used the frequency dependent dielectric response of proteins and related it to the autocorrelation of [ [...] . ]. Based on this formulation, we find a good agreement between the single molecule data on the enzyme candida antarctica lipase B and the calculation using dielectric response data on the enzyme. In single molecule data from other enzymes for which [ [...] . ] is not yet available, we have predictions based on a commonly observed functional form of [ [...] . ] for other proteins. Single molecule experiments on RNA hairpins were used to test a nonequilibrium statistical physics result - Crooks' theorem. Crooks' theorem is about an exact equality relating the probability distributions of work done (W) on a system by varying an external parameter in the forward and reverse directions in a predetermined way. Usually in the single molecule experiments this predetermined variation is a constant rate ([ [...] . ]) of increase or decrease of the external force for all runs of the experiment. Our study focuses on the relevance of the RNA hairpin unfolding experiments to the theorem. The unfolding of the molecule leads to a drop in the externally controlled force on the molecule, a condition which is not suited to the existing derivations of Crooks' theorem. An alternative interpretation of the experimental unfolding and refolding data using a phenomenological force-dependent distortion of activation barriers is provided to gain insight into the data on the probability distribution of work done during <b>unfolding,</b> <b>refolding</b> corresponding to different rates of change of force. This interpretation shows that the crossing of the unfolding and refolding work distributions which happens at the same value of W for all [ [...] . is a necessary but not sufficient condition to verify the theorem. The experimental data on UV photodissociation of the greenhouse gas N 2 O and the associated isotope effects are important from the perspective of atmospheric interest. The calculations in the literature to model the photodissociation observations are of two kinds - some are computationally intensive quantum mechanical methods using wave packet propagation and the others are based on empirical calculations. The two different calculations we present, based on two different variants of the 'multidimensional reflection principle' maintain the simplicity of computation, while using the available ab initio data on the molecule for the potential energy surfaces and the transition dipole moments. In one of the calculations, the absorption cross section was broadened empirically to get agreement with the absorption data and the results were then used to make calculations of isotopologue fractionation. This broadening was also needed in a wave packet propagation calculation. In a later calculation, without introducing the broadening factor, the results were compared only {{on one side of the}} absorption cross section, where the isotopic fractionation measurements are available. Using these two methods, the fractionation of heavier isotopologues of N 2 O with respect to the most abundant isotopologue [ [...] . ] were calculated and compared with the experiments. A simple relation between the fractionations of [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ] was observed in the results from our calculations. A perturbation theoretical result was used to derive this relationship, which is independent of the detailed calculations required for each of the isotopologues individually...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{celebrates the}} emancipatory {{potential}} of writing, {{which can be}} a tool for creating alternative worlds and, as Françoise Lionnet says, for ‘reappropriating the past so as to transform our understanding of ourselves’. I use fictional and auto/biographical texts, read through Deleuzian theories of desire and subjectivity, to argue that we can use our powers of thought and expression to change our understanding of self and others and to live more creatively and joyfully. Traditionally, women have lived secondary lives, shaped and repressed by hierarchical and patriarchal codes of behaviour and thought; many still live like this. Desire has been defined (at least in the dominant Platonic tradition of Western philosophy) in terms of lack and loss; in this binary paradigm, desire is a secondary function of language and culture, and the subject is opposed to, and constituted by, the other. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari propose instead that desire is a primary, impersonal connective force that flows through all life in a Spinozan universe that is composed of one substance, distributed on the intersecting yet distinct planes of the virtual or invisible and the material or visible. On these planes, a multiplicity of incorporeal events and organised forms and subjectivities proliferate and connect in a dance of difference and repetition — always folding, <b>unfolding,</b> <b>refolding,</b> becoming. The thesis is structured as a métissage or assemblage, a braiding of different narrative strands: theory, the literature — fictional and non-fictional — of medieval Heian Japanese court women, and my own auto/biographical writing. My central proposition is that desire is immanent creative energy that produces folds of time, memory, material forms and subjectivity that, ‘like origami, can be unfolded and refolded into different shapes. ’ I use the figure of origami as a recurring motif to describe and explore the ever-changing process of the construction of selfhood, which is both active and reactive, self- and other-folded. This process is illustrated in the literature of Heian women, whose lives were controlled to an extreme degree, but who, in their closeted interiors, created an extraordinary body of confessional and fictional literature, much of which is still extant, translated, studied and enjoyed. Desire, in this labyrinthine world, is active and masculine, yet the literature is a décoverture of men’s penetrative and exploitative use of women for their gratification, and a celebration of the women’s hidden desires (for emotional satisfaction and security, for personal freedom, for spiritual fulfilment) and rich imaginative lives. This year, on November 1, Japan celebrates the thousandth anniversary of the creation of The tale of Genji, the world’s first novel, considered by many scholars and readers to be a masterpiece. Such is the power of the imagination, that a subjugated woman could produce a work that is transformative in its creative power throughout and beyond one thousand years of world history and culture. Within the braided narrative of the origami of desire, stories of my life are framed by reflections that theorise the themes of failed subjectivity — a construction of femininity within the bourgeois paradigm of woman as mother to her children and wife (and mother) to her husband, without ‘a life, sex and desires of her own’. The exclusion and censorship of female desire from this subjectification led, in my case, to a pursuit of love that resulted in the loss of my children. The causes and effects of that loss in my life and theirs are narrated in several memoirs, and the interpretive narrative seeks to unfold the old dysfunctional and hegemonic forms of desire and repression that produced this failure and perform an autopoiesis or re-creation of self in different, freer, more fluid forms. This thesis is a mise-en-abîme of stories of self and others folded within the main narrative of desire as origami. Works of fiction and memoirs present narrated worlds that reflect the ‘real’ world we inhabit, creating stories within stories where, like Alice through the looking-glass, we can see much that is the same, yet much that is different. We return to the everyday world changed in subtle ways, and we can use our perceptions and affective responses to refold ourselves and the way we react to circumstances. The narration of self and other in memoir and fiction is a way in which we can reinterpret the world and thereby change it, becoming worthy of what happens, becoming the offspring of our own events, so that, as Deleuze puts it, we can have one more birth...|$|E

Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) -induced <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> were measured with circular dichroism at 220 nm, and heat-induced denaturation was studied with differential scanning calorimetry. Both GdnHCl- and heat-induced denaturation are very reversible. It was difficult to obtain the equilibrated unfolding curve of Tk-RNase HII below 40 °C, because of the remarkably slow unfolding. The two-state <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> reactions attained equilibrium at 50 °C after 2 weeks. The Gibbs energy change of GdnHCl-induced unfolding (∆G(H 2 O)) at 50 °C was 43. 6 kJ mol- 1.

Throughout a wide temperature range, the simulated transition mechanism of the N-terminal domain (nCaM) follows a two-state transition mechanism while domain opening in the C-terminal domain (cCaM) involves <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> of the tertiary structure. The appearance of the unfolded intermediate occurs at a higher temperature in nCaM than it does in cCaM consistent with nCaM's higher thermal stability. Under approximate physiological conditions, the simulated unfolded state population of cCaM accounts for 10 % of the population with {{nearly all of the}} sampled transitions (approximately 95 %) <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> during the conformational change. Transient unfolding significantly slows the domain opening and closing rates of cCaM. This potentially influences the mechanism of calcium binding to each domain. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|Immobilizing biomolecules {{provides}} {{the advantage of}} observing them individually for extended time periods, which is impossible to accomplish for freely diffusing molecules in solution. In order to immobilize individual protein molecules, we encapsulated them in polymeric vesicles made of amphiphilic triblock copolymers and tethered the vesicles to a cover slide surface. A major goal {{of this study is}} to investigate polymeric vesicles with respect to their suitability for protein-folding studies. The fact that polymeric vesicles possess an extreme stability under various chemical conditions is supported by our observation that harsh unfolding conditions do not perturb the structural integrity of the vesicles. Moreover, polymerosomes prove to be permeable to GdnHCl and, thereby, ideally suited for <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> studies with encapsulated proteins. We demonstrate this with encapsulated phosphoglycerate kinase, which was fluorescently labeled with Atto 655, a dye that exhibits pronounced photoinduced electron transfer (PET) to a nearby tryptophan residue in the native state. Under unfolding conditions, PET was reduced, and we monitored alternating <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> conditions for individual encapsulated proteins...|$|R
40|$|Reversible {{unfolding}} of helical transmembrane proteins could provide valuable {{information about the}} free energy of interaction between transmembrane helices. Thermal unfolding experiments suggest that this process for integral membrane proteins is irreversible. Chemical unfolding has been accomplished with organic acids, but the <b>unfolding</b> or <b>refolding</b> pathways involve irreversible steps. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) {{has been used as}} a perturbant to study reversible <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> kinetics. However, the interpretation of these experiments is not straightforward. It is shown that the results could be explained by SDS binding without substantial unfolding. Furthermore, the SDS perturbed state is unlikely to include all of the entropy terms involved in an unfolding process. Alternative directions for future research are suggested: fluorinated alcohols in homogeneous solvent systems; inverse micelles; and fragment association studies. Genomic sequencing indicates that integral membrane proteins are abundant, and there are numerous examples of disease states which result from membrane protein misfolding (1). These ought to be sufficient incentives to study the folding of integral membrane proteins, but some biochemists have been discouraged by the notorious difficulty of determining membran...|$|R

This method is based on the hypothesis that the unfolding-refolding dynamics is well described by a Markov Chain.

Experimental and computational results following this approach have shed {{new light on the}} mechanisms of the mechanical functions of proteins involved in several cellular processes, as well as revealed new information on the protein folding/unfolding free-energy landscapes. To investigate how protein molecules of different folds respond to a stretching force, and to elucidate the effects of solution conditions on the mechanical stability of a protein, we synthesized polymers of the protein ubiquitin and characterized the force-induced <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> of individual ubiquitin molecules using an atomic-force-microscope-based single-molecule manipulation technique. The ubiquitin molecule was highly resistant to a stretching force, and the mechanical unfolding process was reversible. A model calculation based on the hydrogen-bonding pattern in the native structure was performed to explain the origin of this high mechanical stability.

40|$|The {{conformational}} {{stability and}} the folding {{properties of the}} all-beta-type protein human {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (hFGF- 2) were studied by means of fluorescence spectroscopy. The results show that the instability of the biological activity of hFGF- 2 is also reflected in a low conformational stability of the molecule. The reversibility of the <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> process was established under reducing conditions. Determination of the free-energy of unfolding in the presence of reducing agents revealed that the conformational stability of hFGF- 2 (DeltaGH 2 Oapp congruent with 21 kJ. mol- 1, 25 degreesC) is low compared with other globular proteins under physiological conditions (20 - 60 kJ. mol- 1). However, the conformational stability of hFGF- 2 is particularly low under non-reducing conditions. This instability is attributed to intramolecular disulphide-bond formation, rendering the molecule more susceptible to denaturant-induced unfolding. In addition, denaturant-induced unfolding of hFGF- 2 renders the protein more susceptible to irreversible oxidative denaturation. Experimental evidence is provided that the irreversibility of the <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> process in the absence of reducing agents is linked to the formation of an intramolecular disulphide bond involving cysteines 96 and 101...|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} of nonequilibrium processes in nano-sized objects, where the typical energies involved {{are a few}} times, is increasingly becoming central to disciplines as diverse as condensed-matter physics, materials science, and biophysics. Major recent developments towards a unified treatment of arbitrarily large fluctuations in small systems are described by fluctuation theorems that relate the probabilities of a system absorbing from or releasing to the bath a given amount of energy in a nonequilibrium process. Here we experimentally verify the Crooks Fluctuation Theorem (CFT) under weak and strong nonequilibrium conditions by using optical tweezers to measure the irreversible mechanical work during the <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> of a small RNA hairpin and an RNA three-helix junction. We also show that the CFT provides a powerful way to obtain folding free energies in biomolecules by determining the crossing between the <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> irreversible work distributions. The method {{makes it possible to}} obtain folding free energies in nonequilibrium processes that dissipate up to of the average total work exerted, thereby paving the way for reconstructing free energy landscapes along reaction coordinates in nonequilibrium single-molecule experiments.

40|$|We present non {{equilibrium}} {{molecular dynamics}} experiments of the <b>unfolding</b> and <b>refolding</b> of an alanine decapeptide in vacuo {{subject to a}} Nose-Hoover thermostat. Forward (<b>unfolding)</b> and reverse (<b>refolding)</b> work distribution are numerically calculated for various duration times of the non equilibrium experiments. Crooks theorem is accurately verified for all non equilibrium regimes and the time asymmetry of the process is measured using the recently proposed Jensen-Shannon divergence [E. H. Fend, G. Crooks, Phys. Rev. Lett, 101, 090602]. Results on the alanine decapeptide are found similar to recent experimental data on m-RNA molecule, thus evidencing the universal character of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The patent non-Markovianity of the process is rationalized by assuming that the observed forward and reverse distributions can be each described {{by a combination of}} two normal distributions satisfying the Crooks theorem, representative of two mutually exclusive linear events. Such bimodal approach reproduce with surprising accuracy the observed non Markovian work distributions...|$|R
