500|$|AllMusic's Jason Birchmeier {{writes that}} the album's {{production}} exhibits characteristics of [...] "the pre-gangsta era, a foregone era when samples fueled the beats and turntablism supplied the hooks", which [...] "sets Reasonable Doubt apart from Jay-Z's later work". [...] "Can't Knock the Hustle" [...] features a smooth beat. [...] "Politics as Usual" [...] has an R sound and a sample of [...] "Hurry <b>Up</b> <b>This</b> <b>Way</b> Again" [...] by The Stylistics. [...] "Dead Presidents" [...] samples Nas' voice from [...] "The World Is Yours" [...] in its chorus. According to IGN's Spence D., [...] "Ski brings back the stripped down piano fill style lending the track a late night jazz vibe" [...] on [...] "Feelin' It", and [...] "22 Two's" [...] has a [...] "mournful jazz inclined groove" [...] that prominently features string instruments. [...] "Coming of Age" [...] contains a Clark Kent-produced beat that samples the melody and drums from [...] "Inside You" [...] by Eddie Henderson.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, the set [...] is {{established}} using perturbative calculations that are combined with models for description of nonperturbative effects. For example, perturbative QCD diagrams for quarks and gluons are {{combined with the}} parton models for description of binding of quarks and gluons into hadrons. The set of parameters [...] includes cutoff dependent masses, charges and field normalization constants. The predictive power of a theory set <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> relies on the circumstance that the required set of parameters is relatively small. The regularization is designed order-by-order so that as many formal symmetries as possible of a local theory are preserved and employed in calculations, as in the dimensional regularization of Feynman diagrams. The claim that the set of parameters [...] leads to finite, cutoff independent limits for all observables is qualified {{by the need to}} use some form of perturbation theory and inclusion of model assumptions concerning bound states.|$|E

6000|$|No, {{she could}} not give <b>up</b> in <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> She had begun, and she must go on, at least till she had some reason for giving up respectably and civilly--only {{she wished she had}} known how unlike it was to what she had {{expected}} before she had undertaken it! ...|$|R

25|$|According to Jim Allan in An Introduction to Elvish, the Númenórean Calendar {{is similar}} to the French Republican Calendar.
