5|$|Until the post-World War II {{population}} {{boom of the}} 1950s, Marysville's population never {{rose above}} 2,000 residents, who were all located within the original city limits. The city began annexing surrounding areas in the 1950s, anticipating suburban development that would replace existing farmland and forest lands. From 1950 to 1980, the city doubled in population, growing to over 5,000 residents, with an additional 15,000 residents in surrounding areas. Marysville's population grew five-fold between 1980 and 2000, increasing to 25,000 through natural growth and annexation of developed areas. From 2000 to 2010, the city's population increased to over 60,000 after the annexation of the <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> <b>area</b> and continued development, making Marysville the second-largest city in Snohomish County behind Everett. In 2015, Marysville was the fastest-growing city in Washington, growing {{at a rate of}} 2.5 percent to an estimated population of 66,773. , Marysville is the 17th largest city in Washington.|$|E
40|$|Population <b>growth,</b> {{especially}} in <b>urban</b> <b>areas,</b> {{is projected to}} increase in the near future. In response, residential growth is commonly channelled into <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> <b>areas</b> located on the suburban fringe of major city centres. There {{is a need for}} adequate infrastructure provision, such as health services, to meet the population demands in <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> <b>areas.</b> Access to health services is a key social determinant of health, and having adequate access can help reduce health inequities. This review examines literature considering primary and secondary health services access in new <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> <b>areas,</b> with a focus on Melbourne, Australia. Academic and grey literature were sourced and reviewed. Themes revealed include challenges in providing spatial and social access to health services. Both nationally and internationally, we found that few studies considered health services access when planning for <b>urban</b> <b>growth.</b> Further research is required to examine how health service access is planned for in <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> <b>areas.</b> Such research may contribute to reducing health inequity...|$|R

Attempts to increase density, ease restrictions on 'accessory dwelling units', or even to develop land already zoned residential, are regularly met with fierce neighborhood opposition: Padden Trails was opposed by the Samish Neighborhood Association; a dense development at the Sunnyland D.O.T. site was scaled-down; Fairhaven neighbors led the effort to prevent the development of Fairhaven Highlands, (now Chuckanut Ridge), which the City ended up purchasing for $8.2 million, preventing more than 700 new housing units; neighborhood groups pressured the City Council to go against staff recommendation to rezone Squalicum Lofts for residential development.|$|E
50|$|Because many of today's {{major cities}} were {{historically}} founded in agriculturally rich areas, prime farmland {{tends to be}} (by virtue of its location) well suited to “growing” houses.

The forms of <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> can be simulated using satellite remote sensing data and suitable classification technique. Due to limited information {{on the characteristics of}} urban expansion especially in developing countries, an <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> classification model is required for <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> analysis. Although extensive research has been carried out into <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> classification, further research must focus on the improvement of classification algorithms since researchers are concerned about the limitation of existing classification algorithms that may produce incorrect classification results. This research is mainly about improving existing classification algorithms for a correct classification results and evaluating the accuracy of classification algorithms in correctly determining <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> forms, The datasets are Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images of Klang Valley, one of the most rapid <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> <b>areas</b> in Malaysia. In order to fulfil the research goal, the datasets are pre-processed into binary images containing the developed and undeveloped portion of the study area. The new urban areas identified from the binary images are classified to their <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> forms using moving window, topological relation border length and landscape expansion index algorithms. The <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> images obtained are analysed to improve existing classification algorithms. The improved algorithm is constructed by adding new parameter and classification rule to existing algorithm.

40|$|Australia’s cities rank highly {{on global}} ‘liveability’ league tables. But how ‘liveable’ are 24 of the {{fastest-growing}} municipalities where {{more than three million}} Australians now reside? Over the next 20 years the population of these municipalities will grow at twice the national average bringing greater demands for infrastructure, public transport, health, education, and recreational services. A major survey of residents in <b>growth</b> <b>areas</b> identified concerns in infrastructure planning and a lack public transport options and recreational facilities for young people. Residents want more health services and employment opportunities delivered closer to home. Securing a sustainable investment base for infrastructure in areas with fast-growing populations should be a major priority for the Federal Government. If we are to create the suburbs we need for the future, a new partnership is required, drawing on the following approach: • Consistent with the National Urban Policy framework, establish a COAG-led process to agree jurisdiction-specific targets for cities as a whole and for particular sub- regions, including, but not limited to, outer <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> <b>areas</b> • Establish a National Urban Investment Fund (NUIF) capitalised by the Commonwealth Government on a five-yearly cycle and with complementary funding from State and Territory jurisdictions to support additional investments. • Consolidate existing urban-policy related initiatives (such as those announced in the 2011 budget) into the Fund with consistent criteria applied across all funding windows. • Inject substantial additional capital to address infrastructure backlogs and to provide for population growth • Ensure a clear focus on the needs of outer <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> <b>areas</b> with specific targets relating to improved access to jobs and services in these areas. • Payments to be {{made on the basis of}} meeting pre-agreed performance targets subject to independent audit under COAG auspices. The approach outlined reflects the National Competition Policy model of reform pursued across the last two decades.

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, <b>Urban</b> <b>Growth</b> <b>Areas</b> (UGAs) have become a tool of choice to manage growth. Numerous states and local jurisdictions have {{mandated}} UGAs in hope of confining urbanization, reducing sprawl, protecting open space and resource lands, and minimizing infrastructure investment.

Nonetheless, thoughtful criticisms have been offered regarding the utility of UGAs to accomplish intended growth management goals, and concerns have emerged regarding unintended consequences associated with their implementation.
