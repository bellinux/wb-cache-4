2500|$|The claimant, Max Mosley, {{had been}} President of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile since 1993 {{as well as}} being a trustee of its {{charitable}} arm the FIA Foundation. He brought legal action against News Group Newspapers Ltd, the publishers of the News of the World newspaper, complaining about an article by journalist Neville Thurlbeck published on 30 March 2008. The headline of the article was [...] "F1 Boss has Sick Nazi Orgy with Five Hookers". This was accompanied by the sub-heading [...] "Son of Hitler-loving fascist in sex shame". Mosley is the son of Oswald Mosley, who was the leader of the British Union of Fascists during the 1930s. Mosley relied upon an action based upon breach of confidence or the <b>unauthorised</b> <b>disclosure</b> of personal information rather than defamation. Mosley claimed that sexual or sadomasochistic activities were inherently private in nature and that their portrayal was an invasion of privacy by reason of a preexisting relationship of confidentiality between the participants.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the best legal arragements {{to ensure a}} balance between the need to protect some Commonwealth information and the need to maintain an open and accountable government through providing appropriate access to information. The ALRC has identified and considered 507 secrecy provisions scattered across 175 pieces of legislation, including 358 distinct secrecy offences carrying a wide variety of criminal penalties. This discussion paper indicates the inquiry’s current thinking in the form of specific reform proposals. In trying to move towards a more open and ‘pro-disclosure culture’, the ALRC proposes a substantial decrease in the use of criminal sanctions – limiting prosecutions to those <b>unauthorised</b> <b>disclosures</b> in which it is alleged that harm has been caused, or was likely to be caused, to a compelling public interest. In most cases, however, the ALRC proposes that concerns about the protection of Commonwealth information should be addressed through better education and training, improved information handling practices, and public service disciplinary procedures. The proposals contained in DP  74 do not represent the final recommendations of the Inquiry. The ALRC is seeking further submissions and is undertaking a further round of national consultations on the proposals in DP  74. It is not uncommon for there to be some significant changes of approach between a Discussion Paper and Final Report...|$|R

40|$|Context {{information}} {{is used by}} pervasive networking and context-aware programs to adapt intelligently to di#erent environments and user tasks.

These mechanisms are intended to prevent breaches of user privacy through <b>unauthorised</b> context <b>disclosure.</b> To be e#ective, such mechanisms should not only support user specified context disclosure rules, but also the disclosure of context at di#erent granularities. In this paper we describe a new obfuscation mechanism that can adjust the granularity of di#erent types of context information to meet disclosure requirements stated by {{the owner of the}} context information. These requirements are specified using a preference model we developed previously and have since extended to provide granularity control. The obfuscation process is supported by our novel use of ontological descriptions that capture the granularity relationship between instances of an object type...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{sensitivity}} of data and risk of potential <b>unauthorised</b> information <b>disclosure</b> that exists in large distributed systems, there {{is the potential for}} sensitive clinical information to be compromised in terms of integrity, privacy and confidentiality. The dynamic nature and autonomy of large distributed health systems makes it difficult to define a centralised access control framework for secure interactions across organisational boundaries. Thus there is the need for a decentralised access control framework that will integrate credentials and access policies between organisations without compromising organisational autonomy. In this paper a framework is presented through which trust is discovered and realised based on an approach we call dynamic trust negotiation (DTN). In this approach, trust is realised by multiple negotiation and delegation hops of security credentials through mediated trust pathways. This approach solves cross boundary authorisation issues and provides an alternative to global (centralised) security models based on shared security ontologies...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} mainly to describe, analyse and evaluate the determinants of the phenomenon of whistle blowing that influences the protection of employees making authorised and/or <b>unauthorised</b> <b>disclosures.</b> It was also a purpose of the study to evaluate the specific role of the Protected Disclosures Act 2000 (Act 26 of 2000) (PDA) in fulfilling its mandate to protect authorised disclosures on wrongdoing in public and private sector organisations. The PDA seeks to combat crime and corruption through the disclosing of wrongdoing. The intention is to create a culture which will facilitate the disclosure of information by employees relating to criminal and other irregular conduct in the workplace in a responsible manner, by providing comprehensive statutory guidelines through the PDA for the disclosure of such information, and protection against any retaliation as a result of such disclosures. An important aspect that this study dealt with was the provision, as a prerequisite to the PDA to be implemented successfully, that individual members of the private and public sectors have to act responsibly and in good faith in making disclosures in order to be protected by the PDA. In order to provide clarity on the conceptualisation of whistle blowing, the study explored the conceptual knowledge of the variables influencing the determinants of whistle blowing and the whistle blower through the application of a literature study of the concept and theories of ethics, values, morals, loyalty, trust and whistle blowing, in order to describe and analyse the variables influencing the whistle blower, the whistle blowing process, the characteristics of whistle blowers and the strategies and procedures employed to blow the whistle in an organisation. The study explored the organisational determinants influencing a whistle blower's decision to blow the whistle in the social context of an organisation {{in order to determine the}} influence of organisational culture and organisational trust as internal social factors that may facilitate the effective management of whistle blowing resulting in no whistle blowing taking place. The study objectives, appropriate conclusions and proposals are addressed based on the role that the PDA, the ethical determinants of the work environment, the determinants influencing the individual whistle blower and the organisational determinants influencing effective whistle blowing, can fulfil, in order to serve as a mechanism to combat corruption.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{is becoming}} increasingly important {{and a growing number}} of systems are being developed to help solve different problems that the developers are facing. Numerous systems for enabling different backend services on remote servers have been developed for mobile applications. By doing so the developers do not have to include the necessary software in the application, which results in a shorter development time. To access these systems, applications need access keys, saved in the application’s source code. If the applications run on the devices that the user has access to, it can lead to an <b>unauthorised</b> access and <b>disclosure</b> of information.

40|$|With {{the use of}} {{external}} cloud services such as Google Docs or Evernote in an enterprise setting, the loss of control over sensitive data becomes a major concern for organisations. It is typical for regular users to violate data disclosure policies accidentally, e. g. when sharing text between documents in browser tabs. Our {{goal is to help}} such users comply with data disclosure policies: we want to alert them about potentially <b>unauthorised</b> data <b>disclosure</b> from trusted to untrusted cloud services. This is particularly challenging when users can modify data in arbitrary ways, they employ multiple cloud services, and cloud services cannot be changed. To track the propagation of text data robustly across cloud services, we introduce imprecise data ow tracking, which identi es data ows implicitly by detecting and quan- tifying the similarity between text fragments. To reason about violations of data disclosure policies, we describe a new text disclosure model that, based on similarity, asso- ciates text fragments in web browsers with security tags and identi es unauthorised data ows to untrusted services. We demonstrate the applicability of imprecise data tracking through BrowserFlow, a browser-based middleware that alerts users when they expose potentially sensitive text to an untrusted cloud service. Our experiments show that Brow- serFlow can robustly track data ows and manage security tags for many documents with no noticeable performance impact...|$|R

40|$|Systems which process patient health data of {{any kind}} are {{considered}} to be medical information systems. Some data can be categorised as non-personal, non-identifiable, or non-patient-based such as knowledge bases. Others are considered as highly sensitive because of the 'need to know' to deliver health care to the patient. Access is not only justifiable for doctors and nurses, but, for specific purposes to administrative personnel and public health organisations. Of special concern are registers on sexually transmitted diseases, mental health and genetic diseases. In future, patients might gain more autonomy and also have access to some parts of their own record. Telematics allows them to update a data base and to consult a knowledge base. Clearly, physicians in charge of the cases have a responsibility that has been recognised by law in all Western countries. Access to patient's data should take into account this responsibility. Although most health professionals would still believe that confidentiality is the main issue, it appears that data integrity and availability are as important {{in the context of the}} 'paperless' electronic record. Information should be complete and correct, to be only accessed by authorized persons. The health care environment is characterised by an open nature of clinics that leaves them vulnerable to theft, damage and <b>unauthorised</b> access. <b>Disclosure</b> of information may affect the patient's social standing as well as their general health.

40|$|Abstract. The private keys {{used in a}} PKI are {{its most}} {{important}} asset. Protect these keys from <b>unauthorised</b> use or <b>disclosure</b> is essential to secure a PKI. Relying parties need assurances that the private key used to sign their certificates is controlled and managed following pre-defined statement policy. Hardware Security Modules (HSM) offer physical and logical protection and should be considered for any PKI deployment. The software that manages keys inside an HSM should control all life cycle of a private key. Normally this kind of equipment implements a embedded key management protocol and this protocols are not available to public scrutiny due to industrial interests. Other important issue is that HSMs are targeted in their development to the Bank industry and not to PKI, making some important PKI issues, like, strict key usage control and a secure auditing trail, play a secondary role. This paper presents an open protocol to securely manage private keys inside HSMs. The protocol is described, analysed and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Phishing {{involves}} sending e-mails {{pretending to}} be from the legitimate financial institutions to recipients and asking for personal information such as username and password. It also redirects network traffic to malicious sites, deny network traffic to web services, and modify protection mechanisms in the targeted computer systems. Consequences of successful attacks can include identity and financial losses, and <b>unauthorised</b> information <b>disclosure.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the experiences of Western Australian bank users in using online banking. The study considered the relationship between the background of the Western Australian bank users and their experience in using online banking security. The research analysed phishing through case studies that highlighted some of the experiences of phishing attacks and how to deal with the problems. Emphasis was placed on knowledge of phishing and threats and how they were actually implemented, or may be used, in undermining the security of users’ online banking services. The preferences and perspectives of Western Australian bank users about the deployment of online banking security protection and about future online banking services, in order to safeguard themselves against phishing attacks, are presented. The aim was to assist such Australian bank users through exploring potential solutions and making recommendations arising from this study. Research respondents had positive attitudes towards using online banking. Overall, they were satisfied with the security protection offered by their banks. However, although they believed that they had adequate knowledge of phishing and other online banking threats, their awareness of phishing attacks was not sufficient to protect themselves. Essentially, the respondents who had experienced a phishing attack believed it was due to weak security offered by their banks, rather than understanding that they needed more knowledge about security protection of their personal computers. Further education is required if users are to become fully aware of the need for security within their personal online banking...|$|R
40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) is {{the latest}} Internet {{evolution}} that interconnects billions of devices, such as cameras, sensors, RFIDs, smart phones, wearable devices, ODBII dongles, etc. Federations of such IoT devices (or things) provides the information needed to solve many important problems that have been too difficult to harness before. Despite these great benefits, privacy in IoT remains a great concern, in particular {{when the number of}} things increases. This presses the need for the development of highly scalable and computationally efficient mechanisms to prevent <b>unauthorised</b> access and <b>disclosure</b> of sensitive information generated by things. In this paper, we address this need by proposing a lightweight, yet highly scalable, data obfuscation technique. For this purpose, a digital watermarking technique is used to control perturbation of sensitive data that enables legitimate users to de-obfuscate perturbed data. To enhance the scalability of our solution, we also introduce a contextualisation service that achieve real-time aggregation and filtering of IoT data for large number of designated users. We, then, assess the effectiveness of the proposed technique by considering a health-care scenario that involves data streamed from various wearable and stationary sensors capturing health data, such as heart-rate and blood pressure. An analysis of the experimental results that illustrate the unconstrained scalability of our technique concludes the paper...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{information}} technology development has vastly helped in accelerating and facilitating the banking services and operations in general. In {{spite of this}} accelerated development in the banking sector, the risk of invading electronic banking systems is evident. This is manifested in many harmful functions such as <b>unauthorised</b> money transfer, <b>disclosure</b> of client information, denial of online banking services as well as various threats linked with online banking at different lineages especially through authentication of the client online. This thesis utilizes cloud computing in the banking system from technological and economic perspectives, and the possible benefits that a cloud computing provider gives. The definitions and functions of enterprise architecture both for cloud computing and the financial sector are discussed, then the new architecture model that I developed by merging the cloud and e-banking architectures is thoroughly explained. This study presents a novel, unique tamper proof USB, sustained with an operating system dedicated to serve the bank’s clients. This device is realised by embedding the bank application in this tamper proof USB while creating an isolation layer in the client’s PC when the client plugs in this USB. The modified operating system platform {{is based on the}} puppy Linux operating system. It has the capability to multiplex physical resources at the granularity of an entire operating system while being able to provide isolation between different operating systems. This tamper proof device is supported by four authentication measures which are; unique tamper proof ID, User account, password and fingerprint with a client secure socket layer. Moreover, I designed two different channels, one with cloud for authentication and transferring an encrypted session key while the other channel is used for communication between the client and the bank after re-authentication accompanied by a one-time password and finger printer image authentication parameter plus session key. The simulation testbed is used to solve the fundamental flow of the mechanism in sufficient detail, using Network Miner to parse libpcap files to do a live packet capture of the network traffic between cloud provider and the client; using Foglight monitoring tools to utilise the simulated server.
