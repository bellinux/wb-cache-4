5|$|Bangui {{has been}} the scene of intense rebel {{activity}} and destruction during decades of political <b>upheaval,</b> including the current rebellion. As a result of political unrest, the city was named in 1996 {{as one of the}} most dangerous in the world.|$|E

5|$|In the {{penultimate}} {{panel of}} the book, as Tintin, Haddock and Calculus's flight back home departs from the newly named Alcazaropolis, it flies over a slum that was seen earlier when they flew into the country. In a stroke of political commentary, the <b>upheaval</b> of the government has caused virtually no change to the slum or the lives of its inhabitants.|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{evaluate}} socio-political instability, we studied the relationship between dynamic order, socio-political <b>upheavals</b> and sustainability in nation states. Estimating the degree of dynamic order inherent in the socio-political regime of various countries throughout the world involved applying Fisher information theory to data from the Political Instability Task Force database. Fisher information is a key method in information theory and affords the ability to characterize the structure and dynamics of complex systems. The results of this work demonstrate that nation states bifurcate into two distinct regimes, which exhibit a negative correlation between dynamic order, as determined by Fisher information, and the prevalence of <b>upheavals.</b> Countries in the High Incidence of <b>Upheavals</b> regime with low dynamic order (i. e., low Fisher information) experienced sixteen times more <b>upheavals</b> than {{the countries in the}} Low Incidence of <b>Upheavals</b> regime with high dynamic order (i. e. high Fisher information). Most importantly, our analysis demonstrates that newly industrializing countries suffer from the most instability, which is manifested in low dynamic order thereby resulting in a high number of <b>upheavals.</b> These results suggest that developing countries endure a period of socio-political instability on their path to the developed world...|$|R

5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of the dynasty, semi-autonomous regional kings rivaled the emperor's authority. This autonomy was greatly diminished when the imperial court enacted reforms following the threats to central control like the Rebellion of the Seven States. The End of the Han dynasty came about during a time of civil, military and religious <b>upheaval,</b> which resulted in the period of Three Kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|And the {{impressive}} personal {{qualities of the}} Communist leaders, their seeming sincerity, and the coherence and logical nature of their program leads me, at least, toward general acceptance of the first explanation – that the Communists base their policy toward the Kuomintang on a real desire for democracy in China under which there can be orderly economic growth through a stage of private enterprise to eventual socialism without the need of violent social <b>upheaval</b> and revolution.|$|E
5|$|Arias' {{maternal}} {{family was}} from Nicaragua, having left during political <b>upheaval</b> there before his birth. One of Arias' great uncles {{ran for president}} in Panama, while another was {{a supporter of the}} Nicaraguan revolutionary Sandino, a family history that gave Arias an early interest in politics. His father, an engineer, died when Arias was two years old, and he was raised primarily by his mother, aunt, and grandmother. His mother later remarried to a Panamanian ambassador to the United States.|$|E

The project was suggested to be linked to the disappearances. The publishing house had also already gone to press with a book entitled 2017: <b>Upheaval</b> in China, but it was withdrawn by the author before publication.|$|E
5|$|At {{culturally}} conservative BYU, Romney remained {{isolated from}} {{much of the}} <b>upheaval</b> of that era. He {{became president of the}} Cougar Club booster organization and showed a new-found discipline in his studies. During his senior year, he took a leave of absence to work as driver and advance man for eventually unsuccessful Senate campaign of his mother, Lenore Romney; together, they visited all 83Michigan counties. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in English with highest honors in 1971, giving commencement addresses to both the College of Humanities and to the whole of BYU.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of <b>upheaval</b> and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E

In the 2001–02 season, Goater became the first Manchester City player since Francis Lee in 1972 to score more than 30 goals in a season. City were promoted as champions, and he was the club's top scorer for the fourth time in a row, as well as being the top scorer in the division.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} their {{declaration of war}} on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, the British War Cabinet began to consider the future of Palestine. By late 1917, in the lead up to the Balfour Declaration, the wider war had reached a stalemate, with two of Britain's Allies and Associated Powers not fully engaged: the United States had yet to suffer a casualty, and the Russians were distracted by internal <b>upheaval.</b> A stalemate in southern Palestine was broken by the Battle of Beersheba on 31 October 1917.|$|E
5|$|Kepler {{postponed}} {{the move}} to Linz and remained in Prague until Rudolph's death in early 1612, though between political <b>upheaval,</b> religious tension, and family tragedy (along with the legal dispute over his wife's estate), Kepler could do no research. Instead, he pieced together a chronology manuscript, Eclogae Chronicae, from correspondence and earlier work. Upon succession as Holy Roman Emperor, Matthias re-affirmed Kepler's position (and salary) as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz.|$|E
40|$|Conditions and <b>upheavals,</b> {{by their}} characteristics, {{including}} people opposition with governments and alteration in regional order, have challenged the US strategic {{interests in the}} Middle East region and forced the authorities of Washington to manage and strategize <b>upheavals.</b> The type of US encounter with the trend of <b>upheavals,</b> approach of the ruling regime, the future of people movement and available alternative, interests, and security of Israel and contradiction between strategic interests and democratic principles were amongst {{the most important issues}} facing the United States. The present article is seeking to find {{the answer to this question}} that what sort of relationship does exist between United States policies in the Middle East from one hand and recent <b>upheavals</b> in Arab countries on the other hand? The assumption of the article is that in the past two decades the one sided role of the US in forming the <b>upheavals</b> of Middle East has changed into a bilateral relationship and the behavior of this country in the process of recent <b>upheavals,</b> affected by the presence of the people of Arab countries in internal politics of their own country in numerous cases has changed into a reaction behavior. Finally, it should be said that contrasts between society and government in Arabic Middle East, is considered as one of the prominent challenges of the US in decision-making process and management of region unrests. On the other hand, the lack of a specified instruction and strategy by Americans is another problem of the US in this region...|$|R

5|$|Now King Henry VII, he neutralised the {{remaining}} Yorkist forces, partly by marrying Elizabeth of York, a Yorkist heir. Through skill and ability, Henry re-established absolute supremacy in the realm, and the {{conflicts with the}} nobility that had plagued previous monarchs came to an end. The reign of the second Tudor king, Henry VIII, was one of great political change. Religious <b>upheaval</b> and disputes with the Pope led the monarch to break from the Roman Catholic Church and to establish the Church of England (the Anglican Church).|$|E

The bill was assigned to the Senate Transportation Committee, but was postponed indefinitely after it was introduced. However, after the bill was killed, public <b>upheaval</b> caused Roberts to introduce a new bill, this time in the House, which resolved the same issue. HB12-1347 passed the second time around with a resounding 98-1 vote.|$|E
