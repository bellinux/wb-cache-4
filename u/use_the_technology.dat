5|$|Peel {{worked with}} one of his weavers, James Hargreaves, to {{investigate}} new technologies. In 1762, Peel and Hargreaves set up a carding machine, but decided against using it. When Hargreaves went on to invent the spinning jenny in 1764, Peel was keen to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology.</b> He set them up in his factory at Stanhill where Hargreaves worked. In the spring of 1768, the spinning jennies at Peel's factory were blamed for job losses. The factories and Hargreaves' nearby house were the targets of a riot, destroying the spinning jennies within– along with some of Peel's own inventions. In reaction, Peel moved his manufacturing away from Lancashire. He decided on Burton-upon-Trent where he built three mills, including cutting a canal for one.|$|E

25|$|The Austrian {{engineer}} Paul Eisler {{invented the}} printed circuit {{as part of}} a radio set while working in the UK around 1936. In 1941 a multi-layer printed circuit was used in German magnetic influence naval mines. Around 1943 the USA began to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> on a large scale to make proximity fuses for use in World War II. After the war, in 1948, the USA released the invention for commercial use. Printed circuits did not become commonplace in consumer electronics until the mid-1950s, after the Auto-Sembly process was developed by the United States Army. At around the same time in the UK work along similar lines was carried out by Geoffrey Dummer, then at the RRDE.|$|E

25|$|The GameCube, {{released}} in 2001, is another 3D-capable system. With an LCD attachment, it could display true stereoscopic 3D, though only the launch title Luigi's Mansion was ever designed to utilize it. Due to the expensive {{nature of the}} requisite peripheral technology at the time, the GameCube's 3D functionality was never marketed to the public. Nintendo later experimented with a 3D LCD during development of the Game Boy Advance SP, but the idea was shelved after it failed to achieve satisfactory results. Another attempt was made {{in preparation for a}} virtual navigation guide to be used on the Nintendo DS at Shigureden, an interactive museum in Japan. Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi encouraged additional 3D research in an effort to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> in the exhibition. Although the project fell short, Nintendo was able to collect valuable research on liquid crystal which would later aid {{in the development of the}} Nintendo 3DS.|$|E
25|$|The {{centrifugal}} {{separation of isotopes}} was first suggested by Aston and Lindemann in 1919 and the first successful experiments were reported by Beams and Haynes on isotopes of chlorine in 1936. However attempts to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> during the Manhattan project were unproductive. In modern times it is the main method used throughout the world to enrich uranium {{and as a result}} remains a fairly secretive process, hindering a more widespread uptake of the technology. In general a feed of UF6 gas is connected to a cylinder that is rotated at high speed. Near {{the outer edge of the}} cylinder heavier gas molecules containing U-238 collect, while molecules containing U-235 concentrate at the center and are then fed to another cascade stage. Use of gaseous centrifugal technology to enrich isotopes is desirable as power consumption is greatly reduced when compared to more conventional techniques such as diffusion plants since fewer cascade steps are required to reach similar degrees of separation. In fact, gas centrifuges using uranium hexafluoride have largely replaced gaseous diffusion technology for uranium enrichment. As well as requiring less energy to achieve the same separation, far smaller scale plants are possible, making them an economic possibility for a small nation attempting to produce a nuclear weapon. Pakistan is believed to have used this method in developing its nuclear weapons.|$|E
500|$|On Her Majesty's Secret Service was {{released}} on 18 December 1969 with its premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. Lazenby appeared at the premiere with a beard, looking [...] "very un-Bond-like", according to the Daily Mirror. Lazenby claimed the producers had tried {{to persuade him to}} shave it off to appear like Bond, but at that stage he had already decided not to make another Bond film and rejected the idea. The beard and accompanying shoulder-length hair [...] "strained his already fragile relationship with Saltzman and Broccoli". As On Her Majesty's Secret Service had been filmed in stereo, the first Bond film to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology,</b> the Odeon had a new speaker system installed to benefit the new sounds.|$|E

2500|$|Booster Gold {{appeared}} alongside Jaime Reyes and Ted Kord in [...] "Booster", the 18th {{episode of}} the 10th and final season of Smallville, written by Geoff Johns. Booster was played by Eric Martsolf. Much like in the comics, Booster is portrayed as a fame-seeker from the future who travels {{back in time to}} become a superstar. His antics bring him into conflict with a young Clark Kent, who has not yet taken on the Superman identity. After Booster's misguided heroics lead to an alien parasite bonding with a teenager named Jaime Reyes, the boy attacks Booster. Booster is able to convince Jaime to fight the Scarab's influence, and the youth ultimately gains control over it. After his near-death, Booster confesses to Clark that he is a washed-up athlete from the 25th century, and that he had traveled back in time in hopes of taking Superman's place in the timestream. Booster chooses to stay in the 21st century to help Jaime learn to use his powers for good. Skeets does not appear physically, but instead exists as a voice speaking in Booster's earpiece from an unknown location. (An alternative interpretation is that the earpiece is Skeets.) Additionally, Booster is shown in possession of a Legion Flight Ring, which he admits he stole from a member of the Legion. On the next episode, [...] "Dominion", dialogue suggests that Booster has joined the Justice League, and Tess Mercer is able to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> he brought from the future to aid Clark and Oliver Queen during their journey to the Phantom Zone.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Ori" [...] {{comes from}} the word [...] "Origin", as in {{the origin of the}} Ancients. When {{executive}} producer Robert C. Cooper looked at the root of [...] "origin", he retcon-invented the word [...] "Origin" [...] as the name of the Ori religion. Cooper said it was an interesting idea for him to address the philosophical arguments with various religious people, seeing the whole challenge as [...] "how do you prove whose God exists or whether God exists at all?" [...] Instead of the Goa'uld, who were proved quickly to not be gods by killing them and figuring out their technology, {{it would be hard to}} present the same argument to the Ori followers because the Ori were essentially ascended gods. Even if their gods were dead, it would not make much difference for them, as their followers would continue to believe; without the [...] "magic powers" [...] of the Ori, their followers and the Priors (the Ori's missionaries) could still <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> and their ships. Cooper said that [...] "it's not necessarily wrong to believe in something ... what's wrong is to murder somebody because they don't believe the way you do." [...] Although Cooper was reluctant to get too serious about the meaning behind the Ori as Stargate should [...] "first and foremost [...] entertain people", he considered it representative of television and the media, [...] "mak people believe whatever the people in charge of that magic box [...] whatever they want you to believe they can pretty much convince you, or convince the vast majority of people." [...] For Cooper, [...] "the followers of the Ori were the interesting part", and he [...] "wanted to do a story that was in some way reflective of the differences between people's beliefs that we see around us in our society, and how conflicts arise as a result of that." [...] Cooper was particularly interested in the interaction between Ori followers and other normal human beings, the resulting [...] "mysterious aspect and quality to religious belief and the passion that it invokes." [...] The producers therefore put the Ori in the story background, similar to the way there was very little direct interaction between the actual deities of the religion and mankind in real life.|$|E
