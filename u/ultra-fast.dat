25|$|The Government has two {{plans to}} bring <b>Ultra-Fast</b> Broadband to 97.8% of the {{population}} by 2019, and is spending NZ$1.35 billion on public-private partnerships to roll out fibre-to-the-home connection in all main towns and cities with population over 10,000. The program aims to deliver <b>ultra-fast</b> broadband capable of at least 100 Mbit/s download and 50Mbit/s upload to 75% of New Zealanders by 2019.

25|$|Specific {{rail-to-rail}} comparators with p-n-p input transistors, {{like the}} LM139 family, allow the input potential to drop 0.3nbsp&volts below the negative supply rail, {{but do not}} allow it {{to rise above the}} positive rail. Specific <b>ultra-fast</b> comparators, like the LMH7322, allow input signal to swing below the negative rail and above the positive rail, although by a narrow margin of only 0.2nbsp&V. Differential input voltage (the voltage between two inputs) of a modern rail-to-rail comparator is usually limited only by the full swing of power supply.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of high gain, low noise, high frequency response or, equivalently, <b>ultra-fast</b> response, and large area of collection has maintained photomultipliers an essential place in nuclear and particle physics, astronomy, medical diagnostics including blood tests, medical imaging, motion picture film scanning (telecine), radar jamming, and high-end image scanners known as drum scanners. Elements of photomultiplier technology, when integrated differently, {{are the basis}} of night vision devices. Research that analyzes light scattering, such as the study of polymers in solution often use a laser and a PMT to collect the scattered light data.|$|E
25|$|The Silverstone circuit {{had been}} heavily modified; {{it was no}} longer the simplistic, <b>ultra-fast</b> circuit it had been since its inception; it was now more of a {{technical}} circuit, but it was still relatively fast. Mansell took pole position ahead of Senna, Patrese, Berger, Prost and Alesi. At the start, Senna took the lead from Mansell while Berger hit Patrese, spinning Patrese out while Berger dropped down the order, behind Prost, Alesi and Moreno. At the front, Mansell turned off the rev-limiter to accelerate past Senna into the Hangar straight. Thus Mansell led from Senna, Alesi, Prost, Moreno and Berger.|$|E
25|$|The track {{underwent}} a major redesign between the 1990 and 1991 races, transforming the <b>ultra-fast</b> track (where {{in its last}} years every corner was taken in no lower than fourth or fifth gear, depending on the transmission of the car, except for the Bridge chicane, which was usually taken in second gear) into a more technical track. The reshaped track's first F1 race {{was perhaps the most}} memorable of recent years, with Nigel Mansell coming home first in front of his home crowd. On his victory lap back to the pits Mansell even found time to pick up stranded rival Ayrton Senna and give him a lift on his side-pod after Senna's McLaren had run out of fuel on the final lap of the race.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, ALLO Communications {{announced}} that it would bring ultra-high speed fiber internet to the city. [...] Speeds up to 1 Gigabit per second were planned for both business and household use by using the city's existing fiber network. [...] Construction on the citywide network was to begin in March 2016 and was estimated to be complete by 2019. [...] Telephone and cable TV service would also be included, making it the third company to compete for such services within Lincoln. [...] In April 2016, Windstream Communications {{announced that}} 2,300 customers in Lincoln had 1 Gigabit per second internet with an expected expansion of services to 25,000 customers by 2017, making it the first company to have <b>ultra-fast</b> internet available within the city.|$|E
500|$|With {{the advent}} of fast and {{inexpensive}} sequencing instruments, the growth of databases of DNA sequences is now exponential (e.g., the NCBI GenBank database [...] ). Faster and efficient tools are needed {{to keep pace with}} the high-throughput sequencing, because the BLAST-based approaches such as MG-RAST or MEGAN run slowly to annotate large samples (e.g., several hours to process a small/medium size dataset/sample [...] ). Thus, <b>ultra-fast</b> classifiers have recently emerged, thanks to more affordable powerful servers. These tools can perform the taxonomic annotation at extremely high speed, for example CLARK [...] (according to CLARK's authors, it can classify accurately [...] "32 million metagenomic short reads per minute"). At such a speed, a very large dataset/sample of a billion short reads can be processed in about 30 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Vanishing Point premiered in January 1971 and did {{not receive}} {{positive}} notices. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Champlin wrote, [...] "Vanishing Point {{might have had a}} point, but it ... ah ... got lost. What's left is sophisticated craft and fashionably hokey cynicism". Variety magazine said, [...] "While stock car addicts may be able to maintain interest in the <b>ultra-fast</b> manipulation of the car, many viewers will just get car-sick ... or sick of the car, which isn't the same thing". Larry Cohen, in the Reporter criticized the film for being [...] "calculated, tedious and in desperate need of tightening, the picture, produced by Norman Spencer, is uninvolving and devoid of a cohesiveness that might have made it work".|$|E
2500|$|In New Mexico, U.S., {{scientists}} {{tested a}} new terawatt laser which provoked lightning. Scientists fired <b>ultra-fast</b> pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region. The laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as [...] "filaments". Before the lightning strikes earth, the filaments lead electricity through the clouds, {{playing the role}} of lightning rods. Researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike. Nevertheless, a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered. According to the French and German scientists who ran the experiment, the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke lightning strikes on demand. Statistical analysis showed that their laser pulses indeed enhanced the electrical activity in the thundercloud where it was aimed—in effect they generated small local discharges located at the position of the plasma channels.|$|E
2500|$|DESI can be {{coupled to}} <b>ultra-fast</b> liquid {{chromatography}} using an LC eluent splitting strategy. It {{is a strategy}} through a tiny orifice on an LC capillary tube. There is negligible dead volume and back pressure that allows for almost real time mass spectrometry detection with a fast elution and purification. This coupling {{can be used to}} ionize a wide range of molecules, from small organics to high mass proteins. This is different from ESI (electrospray ionization) in that {{it can be used to}} directly analyze salt-containing sample solutions without requiring [...] “make-up” solvents/ acids to be doped into the sample. This set up allows for a high flow rate without splitting. The high resolution that is accomplished by reverse-phase HPLC can be combined with this procedure to produce high throughput screening of natural products as well. The incorporation of the electrochemistry component helps with ionization efficiency via the electrochemical conversion. This method is proved better than ESI in the fact that you don't have to separate the small potential that is applied to the cell from the potential on the spray in DESI. DESI also shows a better tolerance to inorganic salt electrolytes and you can use traditional solvents used in electrolysis.|$|E
