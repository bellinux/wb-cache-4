40|$|Optical {{inspection}} systems require fast {{image acquisition}} at significantly enhanced resolution when utilized for advanced machine vision tasks. Examples are quality assurance in print inspection, {{printed circuit board}} inspection, wafer inspection, real-time surveillance of railroad tracks, and in-line monitoring in flat panel fabrication lines. Ultra-highspeed is an often demanded feature in modern industrial production facilities, especially, where it comes to high volume production. A novel technology {{in this context is}} the new high-speed sensor for line-scan camera applications with <b>unmatched</b> <b>line</b> rates up to 200 kHz (tri-linear RGB) and 600 kHz (b/w), presented in this paper. At this speed, the multiline-scan sensor provides full color images with, e. g., a spatial resolution of 50 µm at a transport speed of 10 m/s. In contrast to conventional Bayer pattern or three-chip approaches, the sensor presented here utilizes the tri-linear principle, where the color filters are organized line-wise on the chip. With almost 100 % fill-factor, the tri-linear technology assures high image quality because of its robustness against aliasing and Moiré effects leading to improved inspection quality, less false positives and thus less waste in the production lines...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{problems}} in the design of powerline EMI filters is the uncertainty and ambiguity of their source/load impedances which results in breach of expected filter parameters in a real installation. The paper presents a simple technique for prediction of insertion loss limit values of EMI filters working in arbitrary <b>unmatched</b> mains <b>line</b> impedance systems...|$|R
40|$|Above deck cables on {{naval ships}} {{are exposed to}} High Intensity Radiated Field (HIRF) that may cause {{conducted}} interference and generate electromagnetic fields that exceed the immunity levels of commercially available equipment in the protected environment below deck. Exposed cables, such as open power plugs or lighting cables, are modelled and characterized both as a monopole antenna perpendicular to the deck and as a transmission line, representing a cable close to the deck. Below deck, these cables {{are connected to the}} power distribution network, which is from an electromagnetic interference point of view, a disordered chaotic set of <b>unmatched</b> transmission <b>lines.</b> It is shown that for exposed cable length of maximum 25 cm and not placed in the line of sight of transmitters above 400 MHz, no additional measures are needed. The effect of a simple filter is analysed...|$|R
40|$|This work {{considers}} the distortion created by an <b>unmatched</b> transmission <b>line</b> {{system at the}} receiver of a military data radio. The installation requirements for these types of systems are such that manual tuning of the antenna is impracticable. The antenna impedance may not match that of the cable and radio receiver, resulting in electrical reflections in the cable. These reflections create intersymbol interference (ISI), which distorts the received signal and limits {{the performance of the}} communication link. It is shown that this distortion can be modelled using only four parameters: the transit time, the amplitude and the angle of the reflection coefficient and the synchronization offset. A joint maximum likelihood (ML) block estimator for the parameters is presented with the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound. The performance of the estimator is evaluated using simulations and compared to the bound. A more practical iterative estimator algorithm for the joint estimation of the parameters is also suggested. To compensate for the distortion at the receiver, a filter design technique based on the estimated parameters is introduced. The method, obtained from the least squares procedure, produces an approximate inverse filter for the channel, minimizing the distortion at the receiver. Results comparing the proposed method to traditional adaptive equalizers are presented. They show that the minimum mean squared error (MSE) achieved by the proposed method approaches the power of the noise, the minimum value attainable...|$|R
40|$|Loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) {{studies have}} implicated {{one or more}} {{chromosome}} 11 tumor-suppressor gene(s) {{in the development of}} cutaneous melanoma as well as a variety of other forms of human cancer. In the present study, we have identified multiple independent critical regions on this chromosome by use of homozygosity mapping of deletions (HOMOD) analysis. This method of analysis involved the use of highly polymorphic microsatellite markers and statistics to identify regions of hemizygous deletion in <b>unmatched</b> melanoma cell <b>line</b> DNAs. Regions of loss were defined by the presence of an extended region of homozygosity (ERH) at ⩾ 5 adjacent markers and having a statistical probability of ⩽. 001. Significant ERHs were similar in nature to deletions identified by LOH analyses performed on uncultured melanomas, although a higher frequency of loss (24 [60 %] of 40 vs. 16 [34 %] of 47) was observed in the cell lines. Overall, six small regions of overlapping deletions (SROs) were identified on chromosome 11 flanked by the markers D 11 S 1338 /D 11 S 907 (11 p 13 - 15. 5 [SRO 1]), D 11 S 1344 /D 11 S 11385 (11 p 11. 2 [SRO 2]), D 11 S 917 /D 11 S 1886 (11 q 21 - 22. 3 [SRO 3]), D 11 S 927 /D 11 S 4094 (11 q 23 [SRO 4]), AFM 210 ve 3 /D 11 S 990 (11 q 24 [SRO 5]), and D 11 S 1351 /D 11 S 4123 (11 q 24 - 25 [SRO 6]). We propose that HOMOD analysis can be used as an adjunct to LOH analysis in the localization of tumor-suppressor genes...|$|R
