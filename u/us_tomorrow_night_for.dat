The doctor questions her about the day that led her to be institutionalised but she refuses to answer. Later, Su-mi returns home to her family's secluded estate in the countryside with her father and her younger sister Su-yeon.

5000|$|Slydini became {{largely unknown}} to the public but a legend {{to those in the}} magic profession. He was {{constantly}} featured in the magic magazines and publications. The Linking Ring, a publication of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, highlighted him in their 1951 February issue. Talk show host Dick Cavett wrote about his first meeting with Slydini in a New York Times column, [...] "Doug Henning said to me, ‘Tony’s doing a special demonstration <b>for</b> some magicians <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night</b> at Vesuvio restaurant. Come.’ <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>night</b> finally came. <b>For</b> the magicians, sitting for nearly two hours at that table, sudden gasps and intakes of breath abounded. It was like seeing a man walk up a wall. Nothing prepared you for it. Right at the start, a solid, heavy silver dollar, held before my eyes, vanished into thinnest air. And by no method I knew of. Certainly no sleeves. The two hours flew too quickly." ...|$|R
50|$|J: First and third. Tying run at third, {{winning run}} at first, two out, the pitch! a swing and a...foul tip, {{he just got}} {{a piece of it}} and that's how close Boston was to nailing it down. A foul by Mookie Wilson keeps him up there. two balls two strikes. The Mets have scored here in the tenth, they trail 5-4 trying to send <b>us</b> into <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night.</b> Here's the pitch! Swing and a foul, back and out of play and Wilson {{hammered}} at one outside, in the strike zone I think, stays 2-2. Mitchell the tying run at third, a base hit ties it for New York, a long one could win it, a home run would win it, the pitch! Ball three! Wild pitch! We're gonna be tied! The ball went off the glove of the catcher. We're 5-5 {{in the bottom of the}} tenth. Unbelievable, it's 5-5 and now the winning run is at second with two out. A breaking ball handcuffed Gedman, a breaking ball handcuffed the catcher and Mitchell raced home with the tying run and Mookie Wilson could win it here. They have a base open and Howard Johnson up next. That run charged to Schiraldi. The 3-2 pitch on the way, swing and a high pop foul going out of play. And it gives everybody a chance to collect their collective breath as the Mets have scored two here in the tenth after scoring a run in the eighth to pull it out of the bag again.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{begins the}} night, that Flav welcomes Season 1's Tiffany Pollard aka New York {{back to the}} house as a guest to help him decide about <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night's</b> {{eliminations}} <b>for</b> the seven remaining ladies. All the girls are pissed that New York returned to the house, because a lot of them don't like or get along with New York. Flav leaves the girls alone and New York asks the girls about each other and Bootz lets New York know that she doesn't like her and doesn't want her there and that she's just another bitch trying to steal her man. New York and Bootz get into an argument, where New York calls Bootz a [...] "dreamer" [...] meaning she's just dreaming of Flav being her man. The next day, the girls wake up and are told to go to a photoshoot for URB Magazine. New York is in charge of how the women look. New York is yelling at everybody because they were late and screams to them to come down stairs. New York gets into an argument with Bootz when Bootz is late coming downstairs for the evaluation. New York has rude things to say to all of them except Deelishis and Beautful.|$|R
