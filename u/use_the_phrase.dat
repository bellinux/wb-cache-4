5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, as {{a result}} of both {{production}} peaks in some nations and political instability in others, the world's supply of petroleum tightened leading to an energy crisis during the 1970s and early 1980s. Petroleum prices rose dramatically, greatly benefiting Texas, particularly as compared {{to other parts of the}} U.S. that faced recession during this time. A new economic boom emerged which, though not as transformative as the early 1900s, pushed the population of Texas to the point that, by the end of the century, Texas was the second most populous state in the nation. Some sources, in fact, <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> Texas oil boom to refer to this later period rather than the earlier period that followed Spindletop.|$|E

The system was characterized by rapidly rising levels of voter interest, beginning in 1828, as demonstrated by Election Day turnouts, rallies, partisan newspapers, and high degrees of personal loyalty to parties.|$|E

Since 1897, a full-scale replica of the Athenian Parthenon has stood in Nashville, and many examples of classical and neoclassical architecture {{can be found in}} the city. The term was popularized by Philip Lindsley (1786–1855), President of the University of Nashville, though it is unclear whether he was the first person to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase.</b>|$|E
25|$|As a Google search shows, {{the phrase}} ad orientem is today much more {{commonly}} used to describe a particular orientation of a priest in Christian liturgy, facing the apse or wall behind the altar, with priest and people looking in the same direction, {{as opposed to the}} versus populum orientation, in which the priest faces the congregation. In this <b>use,</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> is not necessarily related to the geographical direction in which the priest is looking and is employed even if he is not facing to the east or even has his back to the east.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the early}} 1990s, any {{producer}} of Muscadet wine could <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> sur lie on their wine labels regardless {{of the length of}} time and manner that it actually spent in contact with the lees. In 1994, French authorities designed regulations that limit the use of sur lie to only wines that comply with a set guideline. First, while the sub-appellations of Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine, Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire and Muscadet-Côtes de Grandlieu are permitted to use the term, any wine labeled with just the generic AOC Muscadet cannot. Second, the wine must spend at least a full winter in contact with the lees and not be bottled until after the third week of March following the harvest. Some wines are kept in contact longer, in order to produce a more full-bodied style, and not bottled till between mid-October to mid-November. Finally the wine must be bottled directly off its lees and not go through any racking or filtration process. Currently there is no regulation on the size or type of vessel that the wine should be kept in sur lie with. There is a movement among some Muscadet producers to limit the practice to just that done in standard-sized oak barrels, but currently any size barrel or even stainless steel fermentation tanks are allowed to age a wine sur lie and label it accordingly.|$|E

500|$|Other {{versions}} of [...] "have a nice day" [...] are [...] "have a good one" [...] and [...] "have a nice one." [...] The phrase was universalized after 1950 by truck drivers conversing on their CB radios. Scientific {{studies indicate that}} people who regularly smile {{are more likely to}} say [...] "have a nice day". The phrase can have passive–aggressive connotations, and can be caustically used to end transactions with abusive customers. The speaker may also <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> ironically, in either a purposeful or unintentional manner.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> first {{recorded}} <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> to represent Canada was by George Monro Grant, who was Sandford Fleming's secretary and a Presbyterian minister who <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> in his sermons.

500|$|Noise music (also {{referred}} to simply as noise) has been represented by many genres during the 20th century and subsequently. Some of its proponents reject {{the attempt to}} classify it as a single overall genre, preferring to call noise music a non-genre, an aesthetic, or a collection of genres. Even among those who regard it as a genre, its scope is unclear. Some commentators <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> [...] "noise music" [...] (or [...] "noise") to refer specifically to Japanese noise music, while others instead use the term Japanoise.|$|E

500|$|In their 2002 book, Art, Argument, and Advocacy: Mastering Parliamentary Debate, John Meany and Kate Shuster {{called the}} use of the phrase [...] "Think of the children" [...] in debate a type of logical fallacy and an appeal to emotion. According to the authors, a debater may <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> to emotionally sway members of the {{audience}} and avoid logical discussion. They provide an example: [...] "I know this national missile defense plan has its detractors, but won't someone please think of the children?" [...] Their assessment was echoed by Margie Borschke in an article for the journal Media International Australia incorporating Culture and Policy, with Borschke calling its use a rhetorical tactic.|$|E
500|$|The Boston-born American author Edith Shillue {{wrote in}} her 2003book Peace Comes Dropping Slow that when the Irish stereotyped Americans, they tended to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> [...] "have a nice day". While lodging at a house in Ireland, Shillue found a drawing on the wall for American {{visitors}} like her. Drawn by her host's daughters, the picture had the phrase [...] "Havea______Day", with a smiley faced affixed instead of the word [...] "nice". Irish author Aidan Higgins wrote in his 2004 book A Bestiary that the Americanization of Ireland led the Irish to say phrases like [...] "No problem!" [...] or [...] "Have a nice day!"

500|$|The {{political}} and cultural impacts {{of the development of}} nuclear weapons were profound and far-reaching. William Laurence of the New York Times, the first to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> [...] "Atomic Age", became the official correspondent for the Manhattan Project in spring 1945. In 1943 and 1944 he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Office of Censorship to permit writing about the explosive potential of uranium, and government officials felt that he had earned the right to report on the biggest secret of the war. Laurence witnessed both the Trinity test and the bombing of Nagasaki and wrote the official press releases prepared for them. He went on to write a series of articles extolling the virtues of the new weapon. His reporting before and after the bombings helped to spur public awareness of the potential of nuclear technology and motivated its development in the United States and the Soviet Union.|$|E

500|$|In theses 41–47 Luther criticizes indulgences on {{the basis}} that they {{discourage}} works of mercy by those who purchase them. Here he begins to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase,</b> [...] "Christians are to be taught..." [...] to state how he thinks people should be instructed on the value of indulgences. They should be taught that giving to the poor is incomparably more important than buying indulgences, that buying an indulgence rather than giving to the poor invites God's wrath, and that doing good works makes a person better while buying indulgences does not. In theses 48–52 Luther takes the side of the pope, saying that if the pope knew what was being preached in his name he would rather St. Peter's Basilica be burned down than [...] "built up with the skin, flesh, and bones of his sheep." [...] Theses 53–55 complain about the restrictions on preaching while the indulgence was being offered.|$|E
500|$|The term honesty {{in animal}} {{communication}} is controversial because in non-technical usage it implies intent, to discriminate deception from honesty in human interactions. [...] However, biologists <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> [...] "honest signals" [...] in a direct, statistical sense. [...] Biological signals, like warning calls or resplendent tail feathers, are honest if they truly convey useful {{information to the}} receiver. [...] That is, the signal trait conveys to the receiver {{the presence of an}} otherwise unobservable factor. [...] Honest biological signals {{do not need to be}} perfectly informative, reducing uncertainty to zero; all they need to be useful is to be correct [...] "on average", so that certain behavioural responses to the signal are advantageous, statistically, compared to the behaviour that would occur in absence of the signal. Ultimately the value of the signalled information depends on the extent to which it allows the receiver to increase its fitness. Hence, [...] "honest" [...] signals are evolutionarily stable.|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{dialogue}} is repetitive, especially that of Johnny, whose speech is partially composed {{of a series of}} catchphrases: he begins almost every conversation in the film with the salutation [...] "Oh, hi!"

Many of the principal characters <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> [...] "Don't worry about it" [...] to dismissively end conversations, and Lisa often ends discussions about Johnny by saying [...] "I don't want to talk about it". Almost every male character in the film has dialogue discussing Lisa's physical attractiveness, including an unnamed friend of Johnny's whose only line of dialogue in the film is [...] "Lisa looks hot tonight". Despite the significant amount of dialogue regarding Johnny and Lisa's forthcoming wedding, no character ever uses the words [...] "fiancé" [...] or [...] "fiancée", only referring to Johnny as Lisa's [...] "future husband" [...] or Lisa as Johnny's [...] "future wife".|$|E
