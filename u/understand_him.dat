5|$|Chandru keeps {{following}} Rekha; one {{day when}} she goes to visit her friend, he makes her unconscious and takes her away to a bungalow in Ooty. When she regains consciousness, he tells {{her that he had}} purchased this house in Ooty only for her, and again asks her to marry him. When Rekha refuses and begs to be freed, he asks her to stay for at least a month so that she can <b>understand</b> <b>him</b> better, and then reduces it to a week. He makes all the arrangements to ensure that she cannot escape. Rekha later slams Chandru with a spade and runs away. However, he catches and imprisons her in the garage of his house, but is hospitalised for his injury.|$|E

25|$|In the {{original}} Japanese script, Kiki loses {{her ability to}} communicate with Jiji permanently, but the American version adds a line that implies that she is once again able to <b>understand</b> <b>him</b> {{at the end of the}} film. Miyazaki has said that Jiji is the immature side of Kiki, and this implies that Kiki, by the end of {{the original}} Japanese version, has matured beyond talking to her cat.|$|E

25|$|The {{leader of}} the team - Komov leaves the ship to scout the {{surroundings}} of the base. However, Piere Semyonov soon comes to the base himself. Apparently, he tries {{to communicate with the}} humans, they do not <b>understand</b> <b>him</b> and he leaves again. The behavior of the Kid (the official nickname given to Piere, hence the Russian title of the novel) is rather strange. This leads the humans to assume that he was raised by the local alien race.|$|E
25|$|Because other {{children}} didn't <b>understand</b> <b>him,</b> {{he would get}} into fights and be the target of bullying. At the age of 11, after just six weeks of secondary school, his parents took {{him out of the}} regular schooling system and gave him a vocational homeschooling program. His problems were later discovered to be caused by dyslexia and developmental coordination disorder. His parents hired a tutor (Jan) who helped with his studies, but was also encouraged, by his parents to follow his interests. He decided to learn about chocolate and champagne. He has since taken up fencing to improve his coordination (which is affected by developmental coordination disorder).|$|E
25|$|The Court of Arches {{finally took}} {{evidence}} on the case in May 1770, {{two years after the}} bishop who appointed Bowles, John Egerton, had left the see of Bangor. Richard Williams and John Thomas testified that Bowles had seldom conducted services at St Beuno's, and when he did it was only in English. Another witness, Henry Jones, testified that Bowles had conducted a service at St Beuno's no more than three times. Williams and Jones testified that soon afterwards Bowles tried to minister in Welsh, but his grasp of the language was so poor that none of the congregation could <b>understand</b> <b>him.</b> Several witnesses, including his own curate, declared that when Bowles tried to minister the sacraments at Holy Communion, his Welsh was so bad that many communicants either burst out laughing or had to stifle themselves to avoid doing so. Since then Bowles had but seldom attended St Beuno's, and had employed a Welsh-speaking perpetual curate, John Griffith, to officiate in his stead. Griffith testified that he never saw Bowles conduct a service at St Cwyfan's.|$|E

500|$|Lead {{singer and}} guitarist Mikey Heppner, {{who listened to}} {{progressive}} rock in his youth, wrote things that he initially withheld from the band, because he felt that his bandmates would not <b>understand</b> <b>him</b> - he described his work as being [...] "way too proggy". Despite his initial doubt, they loved his work when he showed it to them. Thereafter, Heppner began describing the forthcoming record in progressive rock terms during interviews. He told the Whistler Question that it [...] "is a little more musically complex; deeper into the sort of metal side where we started out from", but that [...] "It still sounds like us". He also told Jam! that the new songs were [...] "leaning toward progressive (rock) territory".|$|E
500|$|Lew Grade, the ITC Entertainment financier, ordered Anderson {{to cancel}} {{production}} on The Secret Service during a test {{screening of the}} pilot episode, [...] "A Case for the Bishop", in December 1968. Objecting to the concept {{on the grounds that}} audiences in the United States would be confused by the Unwinese, Grade capped the production at the thirteen episodes that either had been completed or were in production {{at the time of the}} screening. Anderson countered that a nonsense language such as Unwinese is inherently incomprehensible, and questioned Grade's reasoning for the cancellation, responding that [...] "I chose Stanley Unwin because you are not supposed to understand Stanley Unwin, even if you're British. I thought if the Americans don't <b>understand</b> <b>him</b> either, what's the difference?" ...|$|E
500|$|The U.S. militia {{decided to}} wait until the {{following}} day to pursue Black Hawk. To their surprise, when morning arrived, their enemy had disappeared. Shortly before dawn one of the leaders accompanying Black Hawk, a Sauk chieftain named Neapope, had attempted from the knoll on which the band had taken refuge to explain to the militia officers that his group wanted only to end the fighting and go back across the Mississippi River. In a [...] "loud shrill voice" [...] he delivered a conciliatory speech in his native Ho-Chunk language, assuming Pauquette and his band of Ho-Chunk guides were still with the militia. However, the U.S. troops did not <b>understand</b> <b>him,</b> because their Ho-Chunk allies had already departed the battlefield.|$|E

500|$|Gwen's {{father and}} a New York City Police Department captain who hunts both Spider-Man out of {{distrust}} and the Lizard for his rampage. Leary explained {{that he did not}} know much about Spider-Man in the comics and was [...] "more of a Batman guy. Not the '60s [...] but the really dark Batman. But my wife was a Spider-Man nut, which was why I went to Tobey Maguire ones." [...] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, [...] "said to me, 'The first time I met you, I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'" [...] Director Webb said of his casting, [...] "e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him. In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but you <b>understand</b> <b>him.</b> I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{most of his}} films, Sukumar's protagonists {{are shown}} to be characterised with grey shades. Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu commented that Sukumar [...] "revels in giving a slight twist to his protagonist, in his {{background}} and character" [...] and leaves the audience to <b>understand</b> <b>him</b> as he [...] "unties the knots during narration and justifies his behaviour and makes us root for him". Karthik Keramalu of CNN-IBN, in his review of Kumari 21F, stated that Sukumar’s lead characters are [...] "psychologically wired differently", adding {{that at least one}} of the characters in his films [...] "behaves in a way that will amuse the audience and the other characters present in the film". Regarding the same, Sukumar said, [...] "We all have a lot of emotions and we suppress most of them fearing rejection. Instead we sport a smile and move on in this world. Problems arise when we don’t enjoy all feelings like jealousy, selfishness and don’t express them. To achieve something, there must be a driving force and that could be jealousy which you term as negative".|$|E
500|$|On {{their first}} meeting, Romeo and Juliet use {{a form of}} {{communication}} recommended by many etiquette authors in Shakespeare's day: metaphor. By using metaphors of saints and sins, Romeo was able to test Juliet's feelings for him in a non-threatening way. This method was recommended by Baldassare Castiglione (whose works had been translated into English by this time). He pointed out that if a man used a metaphor as an invitation, the woman could pretend she did not <b>understand</b> <b>him,</b> and he could retreat without losing honour. Juliet, however, participates in the metaphor and expands on it. The religious metaphors of [...] "shrine", [...] "pilgrim", and [...] "saint" [...] were fashionable in the poetry {{of the time and}} more likely to be understood as romantic rather than blasphemous, as the concept of sainthood was associated with the Catholicism of an earlier age. Later in the play, Shakespeare removes the more daring allusions to Christ's resurrection in the tomb he found in his source work: Brooke's Romeus and Juliet.|$|E

500|$|A {{few hours}} after midnight on 22 July, with Black Hawk's band resting on a knoll on the Wisconsin Heights Battlefield, Neapope, {{one of the key}} leaders {{accompanying}} Black Hawk, attempted to explain to the nearby militia officers that his group wanted only to end the fighting and go back across the Mississippi River. In a [...] "loud shrill voice" [...] he delivered a conciliatory speech in his native Ho-Chunk language, assuming Pauquette and his band of Ho-Chunk guides were still with the militia at Wisconsin Heights. However, the U.S. troops did not <b>understand</b> <b>him,</b> because their Sauk allies had already departed the battlefield. Following this failed attempt at peace, Neapope abandoned the cause and returned to a nearby Ho-Chunk village. The British Band had slowly disintegrated over the months of conflict; most of the Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi that had joined were gone by the Battle of Bad Axe. Others, especially children and the elderly, had died of starvation while the band fled the pursuing militia through the swamps around Lake Koshkonong.|$|E
500|$|The cast was {{receptive}} to the finale storyline. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, actor John Noble noted he liked how the story ultimately ended with having the two Walters [...] "perhaps negotiate a truce and put their minds together" [...] through a [...] "very inventive intervention by Peter, who basically took control of destiny and forced his two fathers to look {{each other in the}} eye, as if telling them: Sort it out, gentlemen.'" [...] He later noted, [...] "We finish [...] in a very dramatic place." [...] Joshua Jackson praised the role-reversal of his character with Walter's, [...] "You had Peter wracked with guilt over the circumstances tied to the decision he made [...] and clinging to hope that there might be some way out. I can’t have made a cosmically bad decision! There must be some way to put this right! Which is fascinating, because that’s basically been Walter for as long as we’ve known him. So I loved how Peter ceases to be so stubborn when it comes to Walter, comes to <b>understand</b> <b>him</b> and even begins to see things the way he does." ...|$|E
500|$|Olga was disdainful of {{her cousin}} Princess Irina of Russia's husband Felix Yussupov, {{the man who}} {{eventually}} murdered Rasputin in December 1916. Yussupov had taken advantage of a law permitting men who were only sons to avoid military service. He was in civilian dress {{at a time when}} many of the Romanov men and the wounded soldiers Olga cared for were fighting. [...] "Felix is a 'downright civilian', dressed all in brown, walked to and fro about the room, searching in some bookcases with magazines and virtually doing nothing; an utterly unpleasant impression he makes — a man idling in such times", Olga wrote to her father, Tsar Nicholas, on March 5, 1915 after paying a visit to the Yussupovs. She was also strongly patriotic. In July 1915, while discussing the wedding of an acquaintance with fellow nurses, Olga said she understood why the ancestry of the groom's German grandmother was being kept hidden. [...] "Of course he has to conceal it", she burst out. [...] "I quite <b>understand</b> <b>him,</b> she may perhaps be a real bloodthirsty German." [...] Olga's unthinking comments hurt her mother, who had been born in Germany, reported fellow nurse Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva.|$|E

500|$|On August 30, 2012, Melton and Dunstan {{stated in}} an IGN {{interview}} {{that they were}} hired to rework Self's screenplay as they considered it outdated, being written before recent films in the same genre, such as Clash of the Titans (2010) and its sequel, Wrath of the Titans (2012). The first step will be to apparently humanize Kratos, who will begin as a mortal and still have his family, with the pivotal change being the barbarian attack. Melton added, [...] "We're going to learn about [...] and understand how he operates. So it's potentially 30 minutes... of building up this character so that, when he ... becomes the Ghost of Sparta, we <b>understand</b> <b>him</b> as a human and ... the journey that he's going to take." [...] According to Dunstan, [...] "with a bigger movie like God of War, {{you have to go}} quite a bit deeper into the character as opposed to a horror film". Melton and Dunstan also have [...] "big plans" [...] for Ares. Melton said they are [...] "trying to build [...] up a bit more... so that he can become a true villain" [...] beyond his raid of Athens.|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt's {{essay on}} Hamlet was later used by David Bromwich in an {{extensive}} comparison of Coleridge's and Hazlitt's critical views in general. Although, to Bromwich, Coleridge's criticism of Hamlet contained {{a greater number}} of original ideas, including the general assessment of Prince Hamlet's character, Hazlitt's view is notable in that it does not, like Coleridge, reduce that character to a single dominating flaw, his inability to act. In one of his lectures on Shakespeare, Coleridge claimed that [...] "Shakespeare wished to impress upon us the truth that action is the chief end of existence—that no faculties of intellect, however brilliant, can be considered valuable, or indeed otherwise than as misfortunes, if they withdraw us from or render us repugnant to action, and lead us to think and think of doing, until the time has elapsed when we can do anything effectually." [...] Hazlitt, on the other hand, instead of applying this moral, pointed to the necessity of each reader's identifying with Hamlet to <b>understand</b> <b>him</b> (which, he believed, occurred more readily than with any other of Shakespeare's characters) and the reader's judging of Hamlet in part {{on the basis of what}} that reader then saw in himself. This made it unlikely that Hamlet's entire character would be reduced to a single flaw that would provide the reader with a moral lesson.|$|E
500|$|Olivia and an {{oblivious}} alt-Charlie visit Peter to {{take him}} to a safe location. Olivia knocks out alt-Charlie and reveals herself to Peter, informing him of the machine's real purpose and Walternate's intentions. Peter tells her that he does not belong in either reality, following which Olivia admits her romantic feelings for him and convinces him to leave with her. The couple race to meet Walter and Bell at the Opera House, where Fauxlivia and a team of Fringe Commandos catch up with them. Bell and Olivia hold off the assault while Peter and Walter set up the dimensional device to enable their return home. Lacking a fuel source for the device, Bell sacrifices himself to create a nuclear reaction, using his body's unstable molecular state. Close to death, Bell reveals that he removed Walter's memories at his own request, and he and Walter are reconciled. Olivia, Walter, and Peter return home. Peter tells Walter he will never <b>understand</b> <b>him,</b> but because Walter traveled to another universe twice to save him—which has [...] "gotta count for something"—he forgives him. Olivia is revealed to be Fauxlivia, infiltrating Our Side, when she arrives at a typewriter communication station to await orders. The Olivia from our world is then seen in a military detention center on the Other Side. Walternate visits and stares at Olivia without speaking before leaving her in the dark, in solitary confinement.|$|E
