5000|$|The trap {{mechanism}} {{is akin to}} that present in Dionaea - Darwin even named it [...] "the miniature aquatic Dionaea". The mechanism by which the trap snaps shut involves a complex interaction between elasticity, turgor and growth. In the open, <b>untripped</b> <b>state,</b> the lobes are [...] (bent outwards), but in the closed state, the lobes are [...] (forming a cavity). It is the rapid flipping of this bistable state that closes the trap, but the mechanism by which this occurs is still poorly understood. When the trigger hairs are stimulated, an action potential (mostly involving calcium ions—see calcium in biology) is generated, which propagates across the lobes and stimulates cells in the lobes and in the midrib between them.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the trap snaps shut involves a complex interaction between elasticity, turgor and growth. The trap only shuts when {{there have been two}} stimulations of the trigger hairs; this is to avoid inadvertent triggering of the {{mechanism by}} dust and other wind-borne debris. In the open, <b>untripped</b> <b>state,</b> the lobes are [...] (bent outwards), but in the closed state, the lobes are [...] (forming a cavity). It is the rapid flipping of this bistable state that closes the trap, but the {{mechanism by which}} this occurs is still poorly understood. When the trigger hairs are stimulated, an action potential (mostly involving calcium ions—see calcium in biology) is generated, which propagates across the lobes and stimulates cells in the lobes and in the midrib between them. It is hypothesized that there is a threshold of ion buildup for the Venus flytrap to react to stimulation. After closing, the flytrap counts additional stimulations of the trigger hairs, to five total, to start the production of digesting enzymes. The acid growth theory states that individual cells in the outer layers of the lobes and midrib rapidly move 1H+ (hydrogen ions) into their cell walls, lowering the pH and loosening the extracellular components, which allows them to swell rapidly by osmosis, thus elongating and changing the shape of the trap lobe. Alternatively, cells in the inner layers of the lobes and midrib may rapidly secrete other ions, allowing water to follow by osmosis, and the cells to collapse. Both of these mechanisms may play a role and have some experimental evidence to support them.|$|E
