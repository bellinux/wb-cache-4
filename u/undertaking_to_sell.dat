500|$|Although {{volunteer}} enthusiasm {{was essential}} to the Association's plans in the Harvest Campaign, it did not rely on it at the higher levels; the state chairs were compensated, both by salary and commission. J.W. Gibbes, clerk of the South Carolina House of Representatives, was hired as that state's executive director; he <b>undertook</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> 100,000 coins and received just under $3,500 in salary and commissions, all paid in 1926. Local volunteers organized Chamber of Commerce luncheons <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> coins throughout the South; chapters of the UDC purchased pieces to present to surviving Civil War veterans. [...] The quota for Florida was 175,000 coins, with each town and city apportioned its share. [...] Often, Kiwanis or Rotary groups underwrote local quotas. Mrs. N. Burton Bass of Atlanta {{was reported to be}} the leading seller, once disposing of 233 coins in an afternoon. A series of dance balls honored the UDC members who sold large numbers of pieces. [...] Nevertheless, Hyder and Colbert suggested that there was [...] "a general lack of more ladies such as Mrs. Bass"; many municipalities had trouble finding local chairs. Outside the South, sales were promoted by three professional publicists hired by the Association. To keep public interest high, the Association released Lukeman's conceptions for Stone Mountain, which were on a smaller scale than Borglum's. [...] Lukeman conceived a scaled-down concept, of the three Confederate leaders on horseback. Despite the campaign, sales were slower than expected. In late 1925, the Association offered Northern banks a commission of seven cents a coin; it is uncertain if any took up the offer. The continuing opposition of the GAR to the coins dampened sales in the North, and there was considerable criticism of the coin issue in newspapers.|$|R
60|$|The {{second was}} one of the old Chevalier's polite productions. He was {{perfectly}} able to ignore Berenger's revocation of his application for the separation, since the first letter had remained unanswered, and the King's peremptory commands had prevented Berenger from taking any open measures after his return from Montpipeau. Thus the old gentleman, after expressing due rejoicing at his dear young cousin's recovery, and regret at the unfortunate mischance that had led to his confounded with the many suspected Huguenots, proceeded as if matters stood exactly as they had been before the pall-mall party, and as if the decree that he enclosed were obtained in accordance with the young Baron's intentions. He had caused it to be duly registered, and both parties were at liberty to enter upon other contracts of matrimony. The further arrangements which Berenger had <b>undertaken</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> his lands in Normandy, and his claim on the ancestral castle in Picardy, should be carried out, and deeds sent for his signature so soon as he should be of age. In the meantime, the Chevalier courteously imparted to his fair cousin the marriage of his daughter, Mademoiselle Diane de Ribaumont with M. le Comte de Selinville, which had taken place on the last St. Martin's day, and of his niece, Mademoiselle Eustacie de Ribaumont de Nid de Merle with his son, who had received permission to take her father's title of Marquis de Nid de Merle.

50|$|Gujarat Vernacular Society {{was founded}} by British East India Company administrator, Alexander Kinloch Forbes on 26 December 1848 along with Dalpatram. The fund of Rs 9601 was raised from locals, Baroda State and British officers. The society had in 1877 a fund of £2791 (Rs. 27,910), of which £1000 (Rs. 10,000) were contributed by Premchand Raichand of Bombay. The first {{newspaper}} in Gujarat was started in Ahmedabad by this society. It was a weekly paper issued on Wednesday, Budhvar, and hence in Ahmedabad all newspapers were called Budhvariya during those times. The library, now included in the Hemabhai Institute, and the first girls' school in Ahmedabad, were established by the help of this society. Useful books were printed by it, and the publication of others was helped by money grants. It brought out a monthly magazine, the Buddhiprakash, which in 1876 had a monthly sale of 1250 copies. The magazine is still published. The society helps libraries {{in all parts of}} Gujarat and Kathiawar, and gives prizes <b>to</b> schools. It <b>undertakes</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> and distribute books, and offers annual prizes for essays on various useful subjects. A yearly prize of £15 (Rs. 150) is given for the best Gujarati essay on a given subject, the funds coming from an endowment of £250 (Rs. 2500) given in 1864 by a Bombay merchant, Sorabji Jamsedji Jijibai. Its library contained (1877) 1590 volumes in various languages. At the close of 1876 there were forty-eight life members, two yearly members, and two honorary members. Its yearly receipts amount to about £180 (Rs. 1800) and its expenditure to £129 (Rs. 1290).|$|R

The company announced they were closing their doors on the afternoon of November 6, 2000, mere hours before the 2000 United States presidential election. Pets.com stock had fallen from its IPO price of $11 per share in February 2000 to $0.19 the day of its liquidation announcement.

60|$|Again, {{trade is}} a social act. Whoever <b>undertakes</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> any {{description}} of goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons, and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comes within the jurisdiction of society: accordingly, it was once held to be the duty of governments, in all cases which were considered of importance, to fix prices, and regulate the processes of manufacture. But it is now recognised, though not till after a long struggle, that both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere. This is the so-called doctrine of Free Trade, which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the principle of individual liberty asserted in this Essay. Restrictions on trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint, quâ restraint, is an evil: but the restraints in question affect only that part of conduct which society is competent to restrain, and are wrong solely {{because they do not}} really produce the results which it is desired to produce by them. As the principle of individual liberty is not involved in the doctrine of Free Trade, so neither is it in most of the questions which arise respecting the limits of that doctrine: as for example, what amount of public control is admissible for the prevention of fraud by adulteration; how far sanitary precautions, or arrangements to protect work-people employed in dangerous occupations, should be enforced on employers. Such questions involve considerations of liberty, only in so far as leaving people to themselves is always better, cæteris paribus, than controlling them: but that they may be legitimately controlled for these ends, is in principle undeniable. On the other hand, there are questions relating to interference with trade, which are essentially questions of liberty; such as the Maine Law, already touched upon; the prohibition of the importation of opium into China; the restriction of the sale of poisons; all cases, in short, where the object of the interference is to make it impossible or difficult to obtain a particular commodity. These interferences are objectionable, not as infringements on the liberty of the producer or seller, but on that of the buyer.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} British {{political relations}} with Kuwait between 1890 and 1921. The first notable ruler {{in this period}} was Sheikh Muarak who assumed power in 1896 through the assassination of his brothers. At first he faced difficulties from the Turks, and he therefore signed a secret agreement with Britain in 1899 for protection. By this agreement he <b>undertook</b> not <b>to</b> <b>sell,</b> lease or contract with any foreign power except Britain. At the same Russia and Germany were trying to secure a port or coaling station on the gulf. This of course threatened British interests in the area, especially proposals to make Kuwait a terminus of the Baghdad railway. Turkey in turn endeavoured to strengthen her position by attempting to exile Sheikh Mubarak and by occupying Umm Qasar, Bubiyan and Safwan. Britain denounced this as a disturbance of the “Status quo” and appointed a political resident to Kuwait in 1904. In 1913, After two years of negotiations, Britain and turkey finally reached agreement about Kuwait but the first World war prevented its ratification. Britain thus declared Kuwait an independent principality under British protection. Mubarak was succeeded by Sheikh Salim in 1917, bringing a great change in Anglo-Kuwaiti relations. Salim secretly gave active support to the Turks in the war, causing the British difficulties in enforcing the blockade they instituted. Salim also suffered from strained relations with Ibn Sa’udi over tribal matters and boundaries, culminating in a war for which Kuwait paid dearly, and in British arbitration to end the conflict. Sheikh Salim’s reign lasted from 1917 to 1921 and was critical period for Kuwait in her relations both with Britain and with Sa’udi Arabia. Developments in Kuwait during this period illustrate the growing interest and influence of the European power in the area as the Ottoman empire disintegrated...|$|R
