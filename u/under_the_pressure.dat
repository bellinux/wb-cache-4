Ceolnoth is also known to have corresponded with Pope Leo IV.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian and French armies {{met again}} at Schliengen on 24 October. Moreau had arrayed his force in a semi-circle on the heights, {{offering}} him a tactically superior position. Charles threw his army against both flanks; the French left flank fought stubbornly, but gave way <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of Condé's emigre corps; the right flank withstood a day-long battering by Latour and Nauendorf, but eventually had to withdraw. The loss {{of access to}} the crossing at Kehl forced Moreau to withdraw south to Hüningen.|$|E
5|$|Before Gardner's election, on May 24, 1854, Anthony Burns {{was arrested}} in Boston as a {{fugitive}} under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Edward G. Loring, a Suffolk County probate judge who also served as U.S. commissioner of the Circuit Court in Massachusetts, ordered that Burns be forced back into slavery in Virginia, outraging abolitionists and the increasingly antislavery public in Massachusetts. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of a public petition campaign spearheaded by William Lloyd Garrison, the legislature passed two Bills of Address, in 1855 and 1856, calling for Judge Loring {{to be removed from}} his state office, but in both cases Gardner declined to remove Loring. A third Bill of Address to remove Loring from office was later approved by Gardner's Republican successor, Nathaniel Prentice Banks.|$|E

Individual platforms such as the Sega Genesis and PlayStation 3 are seen as difficult to develop for compared to their competitors, and developers are not yet fully accustomed to new technologies such as multi-core processors and hyper-threading. Multi-platform releases are increasingly common, but not all differences between editions on multiple platforms can be fully explained by hardware alone, and there remain franchise stalwarts that exist solely on one system. Developers for new platforms such as handheld and mobile systems {{do not have to}} operate <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of $20 million budgets and the scrutiny of publishers' marketing experts.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Shostakovich {{acquired}} {{a book of}} Jewish folk songs, and from this he composed the song cycle From Jewish Folk Poetry. He initially wrote eight songs that were meant to represent the hardships of being Jewish in the Soviet Union. However in order to disguise this, Shostakovich ended up adding three more songs meant to demonstrate the great life Jews had under the Soviet regime. Despite his efforts to hide the real meaning in the work, the Union of Composers refused to approve his music in 1949 <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of the anti-Semitism that gripped the country. From Jewish Folk Poetry could not be performed until after Stalin’s death in March 1953, {{along with all the}} other works that were forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Plinian eruptions (or Vesuvian) are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named for the historical eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD that buried the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum and, specifically, for its chronicler Pliny the Younger. The process powering Plinian eruptions starts in the magma chamber, where dissolved volatile gases are stored in the magma. The gases vesiculate and accumulate as they rise through the magma conduit. These bubbles agglutinate and once they reach a certain size (about 75% of the total volume of the magma conduit) they explode. The narrow confines of the conduit force the gases and associated magma up, forming an eruptive column. Eruption velocity {{is controlled by the}} gas contents of the column, and low-strength surface rocks commonly crack <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of the eruption, forming a flared outgoing structure that pushes the gases even faster.|$|E

5|$|Readers of Aristotle {{have found}} the four causes that he uses in his {{biological}} explanations opaque, something not helped by many centuries of confused exegesis. For a biological system, these are however straightforward enough. The material cause is simply what a system is constructed from. The goal (final cause) and formal cause are what something is for, its function: to a modern biologist, such teleology describes adaptation <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of natural selection. The efficient cause is how a system moves and develops: to a modern biologist, those are explained by developmental biology and physiology. Biologists continue to offer explanations of these same kinds.|$|E
5|$|The Avalanche {{chose not}} to re-sign Fleury, and he joined the New York Rangers on a three-year {{contract}} worth $21million that included a club option for a fourth year at $7million. He touched off a wave of anger on signing with the Rangers when he claimed he was unappreciated in Calgary, comments he later stated were directed at the Flames' owners and not the team's fans, who he said always supported him. Fleury's first year in Manhattan was a disappointment. He scored only 15goals in 1999–2000, struggling <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of trying to lead the Rangers into the playoffs and adapting to life in New York. After the season, he voluntarily entered a league-operated program that treats substance abuse and emotional problems, though he denied that either had any effect on his play.|$|E
5|$|At 10:38 on {{the morning}} of 21 June, Fury detonated a ground mine off Juno Beach during a gale and the navy decided to tow her into the British Mulberry harbour at Arromanches where her damage could be evaluated. While waiting for a tugboat, she took on a 6° list to {{starboard}} from flooding. The Dutch tug Thames began towing the ship at 13:25; at 21:14, Fury accidentally collided with the stern of a freighter anchored outside the Mulberry, damaging her port side above the waterline, and the towline snapped at 21:49 when she struck another ship several times. She let go her anchor after drifting clear, but it almost immediately started dragging <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of the wind and waves and the salvage ship Lincoln Salvor was secured alongside to steady Fury. Another tug made a towline fast at 22:18, but it immediately snapped when the tug began to pull forward. Lincoln Salvor had to cast off as her wooden hull was being damaged by slamming into Furys hull and six other tugboats attempted to tow the destroyer clear of the shipping in the Mulberry, but they all failed. Fury struck at least three other ships, including petrol and ammunition ships before she was driven ashore at 01:30. Her crew was able to walk to Arromanches at about 05:30 once the tide went out.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{a decree}} by Emperor Francis II inflicting punishments on German {{subjects}} who {{collaborated with the}} French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the Imperial ban; a prize of 100 ducats was set {{on his head and}} he could not return to Germany. Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the Reign of Terror introduced by the Committee of Public Safety under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance Friedrich Schiller, Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.|$|E
5|$|Droits de l'Homme {{had been}} more seriously damaged than the British frigates, and was closer to shore at the time land was spotted. As Lacrosse's crew made desperate efforts to turn southwards, the ship's {{foremast}} and bowsprit collapsed <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of the wind. With the ship virtually unmanageable, Lacrosse ordered the anchors lowered {{in an attempt to}} hold the ship in position until repairs could be made. This effort was futile, as all but two anchors had been lost during efforts to hold position in Bantry Bay, and British gunfire had damaged one of the anchor cables and rendered it useless. The final anchor was deployed, but it failed to restrain the ship and at 07:00 (according to the French account), the Droits de l'Homme struck a sandbank close to the town of Plozévet. This broke off the remaining mast and caused the ship to heel over onto her side.|$|E
5|$|Potter biographer Linda Lear {{notes that}} none of the rabbit books {{subsequent}} to Peter Rabbit appealed to Potter with the passion she experienced for the original, but, in Benjamin Bunny, she successfully wrote a simple, didactic tale for very young children that was less complicated than The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester. Benjamin Bunny however lacked the vitality of her previous efforts because it was made to order rather than allowed to flower from a picture letter to real children in the manner of Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin. The weak story line of Benjamin Bunny is evidence of her dwindling interest in continuing the Peter Rabbit saga, but the book displays a delight in place, a deep understanding of rabbit anatomy and behaviour, and beautifully miniaturized illustrations of vegetable gardens. Benjamin Bunny presented demands upon Potter she had not encountered in her previous three tales. She had depleted all her sketchbook backgrounds in the production of the other tales and was forced to create new ones, but the greatest challenge to Potter's artistry was consciously working to satisfy both her publisher's demand for another commercial success and her public's expectation of a tale as delightful as her others while labouring <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> to produce a sequel to a work of genius.|$|E

5|$|The 2003–04 season {{comprised}} {{mixed results}} for Alonso and his San Sebastián club. Alonso revelled in {{the opportunity to}} perform in Europe, appearing in all the team's games, and Real Sociedad qualified for the knockout phase of the Champions League. The team struggled <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of the extra matches, however, and were promptly knocked out of the tournament by Lyon and finished 15th in La Liga. The combination of Alonso's outstanding performances and the team's poor league finish made a move away from Anoeta Stadium inevitable. Despite interest from La Liga champions Real Madrid, Alonso remained committed to Real Sociedad. Madrid {{failed to meet the}} £13million price tag that José Luis Astiazarán, the Real Sociedad president, had placed on Alonso and the deal reached a stalemate. Alonso had other concerns and focused on international duty with Spain at UEFA Euro 2004. Despite the fact that Alonso's appearance at the tournament was brief, he caught the attention of retired footballer Jan Mølby, who was impressed with his precise passing abilities.|$|E
5|$|The French advance {{drove in}} the British skirmishers {{and reached the}} sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line {{formation}} for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of numbers. Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French 45e Ligne burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at {{two o'clock in the}} afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN has {{assessed}} the sicklefin lemon shark globally as Vulnerable; it is harvested using anchored and floating gillnets, beach nets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, the fins used for shark fin soup, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. The sicklefin lemon shark is highly susceptible to local overfishing, {{due to its}} slow reproductive rate and limited movements. Off Southeast Asia, this shark has become scarce <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of expanding, unmonitored, and unregulated fisheries, and has been assessed there as Endangered by the IUCN. Widespread habitat degradation, including pollution and blast fishing on coral reefs and deforestation in mangroves, poses an additional threat {{to the survival of}} this species in the region. Already, the sicklefin lemon shark has been extirpated in parts of India and Thailand, and has not been reported from Indonesian markets in recent years despite being historically abundant there. Off Australia, the sicklefin lemon shark is taken in only small numbers intentionally and as bycatch, and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{study from}} life, {{depicting}} {{a black and}} a white wrestler grappling. Although at first glance the white wrestler appears to be dominant, the figures are in fact equally matched; this was unusual for the time, {{as it was a}} common belief in Britain in this period that black people were physically weaker than whites. Showing the subjects under bright light, the painting is a combination of intense juxtapositions between intimacy and violence, dark and light skin, and hard and soft surfaces. The black wrestler is naked; the white wrestler wears a loincloth, although it is possible that this was added after Etty's death. The intense light casts deep shadows, emphasising the curves and musculature of the wrestlers' bodies, as the skin of the two combatants is stretched and distorted <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of the grapple. The figures are set against a dark green curtain and a brown wall, rather than in a wrestling ring.|$|E

However, led by Thuyet, the regents enthroned Dục Đức <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of the ladies of the court.

40|$|Superconductivity of {{transition}} metal dichalcogenide 1 T-TiTe_ 2 under high pressure was {{investigated by the}} first-principles calculations. Our {{results show that the}} superconductivity of 1 T-TiTe_ 2 exhibits very different behavior <b>under</b> <b>the</b> hydrostatic and uniaxial <b>pressure.</b> <b>The</b> hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> is harmful to the superconductivity, while <b>the</b> uniaxial <b>pressure</b> is beneficial to the superconductivity. Superconducting transition temperature T_C at ambient pressure is 0. 73 K, and it reduces monotonously <b>under</b> <b>the</b> hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> to 0. 32 K at 30 GPa. While the T_C increases dramatically <b>under</b> <b>the</b> uniaxial <b>pressure</b> along c axis. The established T_C of 6. 34 K <b>under</b> <b>the</b> uniaxial <b>pressure</b> of 17 GPa, below which the structural stability maintains, is above the liquid helium temperature of 4. 2 K. The increase of density of states at Fermi level, the redshift of F(ω) /α^ 2 F(ω) and the softening of the acoustic modes with pressure are considered as the main reasons that lead to <b>the</b> enhanced superconductivity <b>under</b> uniaxial pressure. In view of the previously predicted topological phase transitions of 1 T-TiTe_ 2 <b>under</b> <b>the</b> uniaxial <b>pressure</b> [Phys. Rev.
