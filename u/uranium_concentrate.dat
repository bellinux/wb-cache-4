25|$|Currently, {{there is}} only one active uranium mine in the country, located in Lagoa Real, Caetité, Bahia. The annual {{production}} of uranium in the Caetité Complex, which is managed by INB, has varied, with the record being 400 tons of <b>uranium</b> <b>concentrate</b> in 2008. There have been plans of developing mine activities in Santa Quitéria, Ceará, where the uranium presents itself associated with phosphate. Even though INB has undertaken some steps toward establishing this new mine, the license has not been issued yet.|$|E
25|$|The sole active mine in Brazil, the <b>Uranium</b> <b>Concentrate</b> Unit (Unidade de Concentrado de Urânio – URA), {{is located}} in Caetité, Bahia, {{possessing}} an estimated 100,000 tons of uranium reserves. This amount could supply the three Angra power plants currently in operation, in addition to four other planned ones, {{until the end of}} their life cycles. Since 1998, when mining activities started in Caetité, annual uranium production at URA has varied; it peaked in 2008, when 400 tons of uranium concentrated were produced.|$|E
25|$|As of July 2014, {{the price}} of <b>uranium</b> <b>concentrate</b> {{remained}} near a five-year low, the uranium price having fallen more than 50% from the peak spot price in January 2011, reflecting the loss of Japanese demand following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. As a result of continued low prices, in February 2014 mining company Cameco deferred plans to expand production from existing Canadian mines, although it continued work {{to open a new}} mine at Cigar Lake. Also in February 2014, Paladin energy suspended operations at its mine in Malawi, saying that the high-cost operation was losing money at current prices.|$|E
