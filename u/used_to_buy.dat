The money can also be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> new combat techniques at dojos throughout the land.|$|E
5|$|During the war, both {{ships were}} mainly {{inactive}} due to Argentine neutrality. Rivadavia undertook a last diplomatic cruise to Trinidad, Venezuela, and Colombia in 1946, but both ships were immobile by 1948. Moreno was stricken from the naval register on 1 October 1956 and {{was brought to}} Japan in 1957 for scrapping in a then-world-record 96-day tow. Rivadavia was stricken on 1 February 1957 and scrapped in Italy beginning in 1959. The money gained from selling the two dreadnoughts along with an older armored cruiser, , was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> an aircraft carrier from the United Kingdom, Independencia (ex-Warrior).|$|E

5|$|The {{expansion}} of the aviation industry was accompanied by the disruption of road transport; many roads are frequently blocked by militia checkpoints which demand payment (between $3 and $300, depending on goods carried) {{in order to allow}} the cars to continue their journey. A BBC report claimed there were seven such checkpoints in the 50km between an airstrip and the capital, Mogadishu.

Katz enrolled in Seton Hall University School of Law on a full scholarship in 2004. Corzine later acknowledged he had given $15,000 to Katz's brother-in-law, Rocco Riccio, a former state employee who {{was forced to resign}} after being accused of examining income tax returns for political purposes. At the time, Katz was president of the CWA Local 1034, which bargains on behalf of many state employees.|$|E
5|$|Each level {{contains}} items {{the player}} can collect, such as coins, {{which can be}} gathered by either smashing Buzz Cola vending machines, Buzz Cola boxes or wasp cameras, the latter of which become more elusive as the game progresses. The coins can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> new cars and player outfits, {{some of which are}} required to progress through the game. The player can also collect Itchy and Scratchy cards. By collecting all 49 of them, seven in each level, the player unlocks a special The Itchy & Scratchy Show video. Several events cause the player to lose coins; because the character cannot die, injuries cause the player to lose coins. If the player is apprehended during a hit and run, they will be fined 50 coins.|$|E
5000|$|The player also {{collects}} money, {{which they}} can <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> tank upgrades <b>to</b> increase {{the power of their}} tank. [...] This includes a more powerful gun and defensive energy that protects the player from attacks.|$|R

5|$|Facilities at {{the station}} are minimal – {{there are a few}} chairs and {{timetable}} information is provided. Help points, giving next train information, were installed in 2010. There is no ticket office, but there are self-service ticket machines which can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> or collect tickets. The Victorian-era station building is only original station building left on the line, decorated with a mural painted by local students, it is used as an upholsterer's showroom rather than for railway purposes. Access is step-free from South Road, through an area containing residents' garages. The platform backs onto the gardens {{on the south side of}} the road.|$|E

5|$|The {{player can}} {{fight with a}} knife {{received}} {{early in the game}} and later with firearms that feature auto-aim. There are also sequences where the player can snipe enemies with a sniper rifle. Enemies do not hide {{due to a lack of}} a cover system. The player can earn money by finishing missions and robbing pedestrians, which can then be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> food, weaponry, spray paint, and accessories for the character's home. The mobile game features minigames for robbing pedestrians, stealing, and hijacking vehicles. While robbing, the player taps happy and angry face icons to terrorize the victim into giving more money. When stealing, a Tetris clone lets the player fit more items into the truck, and the carjacking minigame lets the player earn more money for scaring the captive passenger by driving at high speeds.|$|E

5|$|To {{meet the}} free market situation, the company's {{management}} introduced measures to keep costs low. On 19 August 1993, ten of eleven trade unions agreed to a three-year wage contract, which contained bonuses for all employees based on the company's profit. The cabin crew's union had a two-day strike, before reaching an agreement. At the same time, the company needed NOK400 million in share capital. Braathens Rederi sold the sister company Braathens Helikopter to Helkopter Service for NOK225 million on 30 September 1993, and the money was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> Braathens SAFE stock. The company raised further capital in an initial public offering, and the company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 10 January 1994. After the listing, Braathens Rederi retained 69% of the company.|$|E
5|$|Wizards & Warriors III is a {{platforming}} {{video game}} which features open-ended gameplay elements similar to games such as Metroid and Faxanadu. Players control {{the main character}} Kuros as he sets out to defeat Malkil and free the town of Piedup. The game features three separate realms in which the player must explore - the town, the underworld, and the palace; players can freely navigate from one realm to another. Throughout the game, players find money which can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> items from inns located throughout Piedup; players can buy keys for unlocking doors, food and drink for restoring health, and information from shopkeepers. Players begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives have been lost; unlike the previous Wizards & Warriors games, there is no password or continue feature.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade is a {{tactical}} role-playing game where players take {{the role of}} story protagonists Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector as they navigate story-driven missions across the fictional continent of Elibe. The player takes {{the role of an}} unseen tactician directing the player army. The single-player campaign is divided into chapters which generally begin with story elements presented through the use of scenes animated with still images of the main characters, then followed by a battle with an enemy; after each battle, the player is given the opportunity to save their progress. In-game currency is gained either through battles in the game's Link Arena or through other means, rather than from defeating units. Currency can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> new items and weapons at merchants in between battles and at specific locations within maps. Items can also be exchanged between units during battles.|$|E

25|$|Schmidt {{used her}} own {{wealth in the}} campaign. She told The Cincinnati Post {{the week before the}} {{election}} she put $200,000 of her money in the campaign that she had planned <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a condominium in Florida. The paper noted the median household income in the district was $46,813.|$|R
50|$|As {{the market}} collapses, the {{plotters}} {{are left with}} large amounts of cash, which they <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> up GML and other companies at bargain prices.

5|$|Others {{were soon}} to follow. In about 1340 Francesco Balducci Pegolotti, a {{merchant}} from Florence, compiled a guide about trade in China, a country he called Cathay, noting {{the size of}} Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) and how merchants could exchange silver for Chinese paper money that could be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> luxury items such as silk. John Mandeville, a mid-14th-century author and alleged Englishman from St Albans, claimed to have lived in China and even served at the Mongol khan's court. However, certain parts of his accounts are considered dubious by modern scholars, with some conjecturing that he simply concocted his stories by using written accounts of China penned by other authors such as Odoric of Pordenone. Marco Polo mentioned the heavy presence of Genoese Italians at Tabriz (modern Iran) a city that Marco returned to from China via the Strait of Hormuz in 1293–1294. The Italian Franciscan monk John of Montecorvino took this same journey in reverse starting in 1291, setting out from Tabriz to Ormus, sailing from there to China while accompanied by the Italian merchant Pietro de Lucalongo. While Montecorvino became a bishop in Khanbaliq (Beijing), his friend Lucalongo continued {{to serve as a}} merchant there and even donated a large amount of money to maintain the local Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the Dunstan Government {{stepped up}} its {{legislative}} efforts. Some bills, {{such as the one}} to remove the sodomy law and decriminalise male homosexuality, had been initially blocked by the Legislative Council. However, the bill to abolish capital punishment passed with ease, and the homosexuality law reforms eventually passed in September. Rape law was properly codified and defined as a crime within marriage {{for the first time in}} Australia. Shopping hours, previously the most restrictive in the nation, became the most open. Following a royal commission, Friday night shopping was introduced for the city and Thursday night shopping for the suburbs. The deposits on beverage containers was finally passed. The first signs of Monarto's eventual failure began to appear: birth rates started dropping significantly, immigration slowed and the economy was stagnant. South Australia's robust population growth, previously the highest per capita among the states, came to an abrupt halt. However, state money continued to be poured into the Monarto project, despite the fact that the Whitlam government cut funding to $600,000 in 1975, while his Liberal successor Malcolm Fraser gave nothing at all the following year. However, by the time Monarto was eventually scrapped after Dunstan's departure, no less than $20 million had been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> land, plant trees and formulate development plans, and the failed project is often seen as Dunstan's greatest failure. In addition, the federal government removed subsidies for shipbuilding at Whyalla, forcing the operations to be scaled down.|$|E

500|$|The federal {{settlement}} bill {{included a}} $900,000 appropriation, the appraisal {{value of the}} 800 acres, which the Pequot would <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the land from the landowner defendants.

50|$|However, it didn’t work out. Consumers were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>buying</b> a 50-pound bag of clay kitty litter at $5 a bag, while Wampler’s {{absorbent}} cost $20 for a 10-pound bag. Even {{though the}} new absorbent was 50 times {{more effective than}} the clay litter, consumers figured that a bigger bag was a better deal.|$|R
