40|$|Apparatuses {{and systems}} for {{submicron}} resolution spectral-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) are disclosed. The system may use white light sources having wavelengths within 400 - 1000 nanometers, and achieve resolution below 1. mu. m. The apparatus is aggregated into a <b>unitary</b> <b>piece,</b> and a user can connect the apparatus to a user provided controller and/or light source. The light source may be a supercontinuum source...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{and a system}} for embedded thermoelectric generators are disclosed. In one embodiment, the apparatus is embedded in an interface where the ambient temperatures on {{two sides of the}} interface are different. In one embodiment, the apparatus is fabricated with the interface in integrity as a <b>unitary</b> <b>piece.</b> In one embodiment, the apparatus includes a first thermoelectric material embedded through the interface. The apparatus further includes a second thermoelectric material embedded through the interface. The first thermoelectric material is electrically coupled to the second thermoelectric material. In one embodiment, the apparatus further includes an output structure coupled to the first thermoelectric material and the second thermoelectric material and configured to output a voltage...|$|E
40|$|The {{exceptional}} {{gold and}} silver work of art known as the Lignum Crucis from Seville Cathedral, dating from {{the second half of}} the fourteenth century, has always been considered to be a <b>unitary</b> <b>piece,</b> donated to the cathedral in 1389. Now, however, based on both stylistic analysis and documentation, it can be concluded that it is actually composed of three different parts and that they were joined during the first half of the sixteenth century. La obra conocida como Lignum Crucis de la catedral de Sevilla, una pieza excepcional de la orfebrería de la segunda mitad del siglo xiv, hasta ahora era considerada como una pieza unitaria donada a la catedral en 1389. Del análisis estilístico se infiere que en realidad está formada por tres partes diferentes cuyo ensamblaje, según se deduce de la documentación, es ya un hecho en la primera mitad del siglo XVI...|$|E
40|$|Parts {{with complex}} {{three-dimensional}} shapes and with dimensions up to 8 by 8 by 10 in. (20. 3 by 20. 3 by 25. 4 cm) {{can be made}} as <b>unitary</b> <b>pieces</b> of a room-temperature-curing polymer, with relatively little investment in time and money, by a process now in use at Johnson Space Center. The process {{is one of a}} growing number of processes and techniques that are known collectively as the art of rapid prototyping. The main advantages of this process over other rapid-prototyping processes are greater speed and lower cost: There is no need to make paper drawings and take them to a shop for fabrication, and thus no need for the attendant paperwork and organizational delays. Instead, molds for desired parts are made automatically on a machine that is guided by data from a computer-aided design (CAD) system and can reside in an engineering office...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{composites}} {{have been}} targeted as a 'leapfrog' technology {{that would provide}} a unique global competitive position for U. S. industry. Composites are unique in the requirements for an integrated approach to designing, manufacturing, and marketing of products developed utilizing the new materials of construction. Numerous studies extending across the entire economic spectrum of the United States from aerospace to military to durable goods have identified composites as a 'key' technology. In general {{there have been two}} approaches to composite construction: build models of a given composite materials, then determine characteristics of the material via numerical simulation and empirical testing; and experience-directed construction of fabrication plans for building composites with given properties. The first route sets a goal to capture basic understanding of a device (the composite) by use of a rigorous mathematical model; the second attempts to capture the expertise about the process of fabricating a composite (to date) at a surface level typically expressed in a rule based system. From an AI perspective, these two research lines are attacking distinctly different problems, and both tracks have current limitations. The mathematical modeling approach has yielded a wealth of data but a large number of simplifying assumptions are needed to make numerical simulation tractable. Likewise, although surface level expertise about how to build a particular composite may yield important results, recent trends in the KBS area are towards augmenting surface level problem solving with deeper level knowledge. Many of the relative advantages of composites, e. g., the strength:weight ratio, is most prominent when the entire component is designed as a <b>unitary</b> <b>piece.</b> The bottleneck in undertaking such unitary design lies in the difficulty of the re-design task. Designing the fabrication protocols for a complex-shaped, thick section composite are currently very difficult. It is in fact this difficulty that our research will address...|$|E
