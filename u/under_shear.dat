5|$|During April 1, RSMC Nadi {{reported}} that Tropical Disturbance 14F, had developed along an active monsoon trough {{to the north}} of Fiji. During the next day the disturbance gradually developed into a tropical depression, as it moved eastwards and interacted with a shallow tropical disturbance that was located to the east of 14F. The disturbance was subsequently absorbed by 14F’s circulation early on April 3, while the system was located between Tonga and Fiji. Overall organization at this time was still poor with convection struggling to consolidate <b>under</b> <b>shear</b> and diurnal influences. Overnight of the 3rd, though, convection erupted over the centre with the primary band to the east wrapping tightly around the centre. On re-analysis, TD14F attained cyclone status around 031800 UTC while located to the north-northwest of Nukualofa and gradually accelerating towards the southeast. Through April 4, the cyclone moved into minimal shear with good outflow channels aloft. 12 hours later, at 040600 UTC, Lin was upgraded to a storm with 50 knots close to the centre. The cyclone intensified further under favourable conditions and reached a peak intensity of 60 knots while located about 15 nautical miles south-southeast of Nukualofa. As it left Tonga, interaction with drier air and shear increased. This was aided by an approaching upper-trough from the west. At 051800 UTC, intensity was reduced to 45 knots with further weakening anticipated due to stronger shear and cooler waters. Wellington took over warnings for the cyclone from 060000 UTC and downgraded Lin to an extra-tropical system in their first warning. TCWC Wellington subsequently continued to monitor the system until it was last noted on April 8.|$|E

40|$|Background. Shear-induced {{platelet}} aggregation (SIPA) {{is an important}} mechanism in thrombogenesis. von Willebrand factor (vWF) binding to platelet glycoprotein lb (GP Ib) {{has been found to}} be crucial for {{platelet aggregation}} <b>under</b> the high <b>shear</b> force probably generated in stenosed coronary artery. The physiological significance of vWF-dependent SIPA has not been clarified. Methods and Results. Blood samples were collected from 23 normal volunteers. SIPA was continuously monitored using a modified cone-plate viscometer adapted for measuring the transmitted light intensity of the material. The effects of low concentrations of epinephrine, ADP, and collagen on SIPA <b>under</b> both low <b>shear</b> (12 dyne/cm 2) and high shear (108 dyne/cm 2) force were investigated. All agonists tested enhanced SIPA <b>under</b> low <b>shear</b> force, whereas only epinephrine augmented SIPA <b>under</b> high <b>shear</b> force. The maximum extents of SIPA <b>under</b> high <b>shear</b> force in the absence and presence of epinephrine (10 ng/ml) were 37. 9 ± 11. 5 % and 59. 7 + 13. 9 %, respectively. The antagonist of the a 2 -adrenergic receptor yohimbine (1,ug/ml) antagonized the effects of epinephrine. The monoclonal antibody NMC- 4 against vWF, which was shown to inhibit its binding to GP Ib, completely abolished SIPA <b>under</b> high <b>shear</b> force, even in the presence of epinephrine. However, this antibody only partially inhibited SIPA <b>under</b> low <b>shear</b> force. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that epinephrine is the agonist that enhances SIPA mediated by vWF through its specific receptor. This may be clinically important because occlusion of the coronary artery often occurs in stenosed atherosclerotic vessels under sympathetic stimulation. (Circulatio...|$|R

25|$|Unstable {{colloidal}} suspensions of low-volume fraction form clustered liquid suspensions, wherein individual {{clusters of}} particles {{fall to the}} bottom of the suspension (or float to the top if the particles are less dense than the suspending medium) once the clusters are of sufficient size for the Brownian forces that work to keep the particles in suspension to be overcome by gravitational forces. However, colloidal suspensions of higher-volume fraction form colloidal gels with viscoelastic properties. Viscoelastic colloidal gels, such as bentonite and toothpaste, flow like liquids <b>under</b> <b>shear,</b> but maintain their shape when shear is removed. It is for this reason that toothpaste can be squeezed from a toothpaste tube, but stays on the toothbrush after it is applied.|$|E

40|$|Biofilms {{of various}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were grown in glass flow cells under laminar and {{turbulent}} flows. By relating the physical deformation of biofilms to variations in fluid shear, {{we found that}} the biofilms were viscoelastic fluids which behaved like elastic solids over periods of a few seconds but like linear viscous fluids over longer times. These data can be explained using concepts of associated polymeric systems, suggesting that the extracellular polymeric slime matrix determines the cohesive strength. Biofilms grown <b>under</b> high <b>shear</b> tended to form filamentous streamers while those grown <b>under</b> low <b>shear</b> formed an isotropic pattern of mound-shaped microcolonies. In some cases, sustained creep and necking in response to elevated shear resulted in a time-dependent fracture failure of the "tail" of the streamer from the attached upstream "head.
