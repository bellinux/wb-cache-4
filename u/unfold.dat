The simulations mimic with high precision the <b>unfolding</b> experiments and show that OmpG {{in the absence of}} a membrane and GFP circumvent high <b>unfolding</b> barriers by rotations and explore alternative <b>unfolding</b> pathways. Embedding OmpG in the lipid membrane restricts this search for pathways and forces the protein to cross high <b>unfolding</b> barriers.

By treating the mechanical <b>unfolding</b> of polyproteins as the superposition of multiple identical Poisson processes, we developed a simple stochastic analysis approach to analyze the dwell time distribution of individual <b>unfolding</b> events in polyprotein <b>unfolding</b> trajectories.
