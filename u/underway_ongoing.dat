40|$|Antibodies are an {{important}} class of proteins {{that can be used}} for the prevention, treatment and diagnosis of many diseases. Consequently, there is an intense and growing demand for recombinant antibodies, placing immense pressure on current production capacity which is based largely on microbial cultures and mammalian cells. Alternative systems for cost effective antibody production would be very welcome, and plants are now gaining widespread acceptance as green bioreactors with advantages in terms of cost, scalability and safety. Several plant-produced antibodies (plantibodies) are undergoing clinical trials and the first commercial approval could be only a few years away. The performance of the first generation of products has been very encouraging so far. In terms of product authenticity, differences in glycosylation between plantibodies and their mammalian counterparts have been defined, and the scientific evaluation of any possible consequences is <b>underway.</b> <b>Ongoing</b> studies are addressing the remaining biochemical constraints, and aim to further improve product yields, homogeneity and authenticity, particularly where the antibody is intended for injection into human patients. A remaining practical challenge is the implementation of large-scale production and processing under good manufacturing practice conditions that are yet to be endorsed by regulatory bodies. The current regulatory uncertainty and the associated costs represent an entry barrier for the pharmaceutical industry. However, the favourable properties of plants are likely to make the plant systems a useful alternative for small, medium and large scale production throughout the development of new antibody-based pharmaceuticals...|$|E
25|$|The DFO {{plans to}} {{undertake}} geoduck aquaculture in subtidal areas. No geoduck production currently occurs on private tidelands, although conversion of other shellfish aquaculture ventures operating on tidelands to geoduck {{is also being}} considered. There is no large-scale commercial production <b>underway</b> yet; <b>ongoing</b> trial farms are currently being studied and assessed. Although tenures to possible geoduck farm sites have been granted, commercial licences have not been issued, except for the one granted to the UHA.|$|R
40|$|A new {{and unique}} basic plasma science {{laboratory}} device - the HelCat device (HELicon-CAThode) - has been constructed and is operating at the University of New Mexico. HelCat is a 4 m long, 0. 5 m diameter device, with magnetic field up to 2. 2 kG, that has two independent plasmas sources - an RF helicon source, and a thermionic cathode. These two sources, which can operate independently or simultaneously, {{are capable of}} producing plasmas {{with a wide range}} of parameters and turbulence characteristics, well suited to a variety of basic plasma physics experiments. An extensive set of plasma diagnostics is also operating. Experiments investigating the active feedback control of turbulent transport of particles and heat via electrode biasing to affect plasma ExB flows are <b>underway,</b> and <b>ongoing...</b>|$|R
25|$|Ecologically {{motivated}} {{research into}} genetic modification is <b>underway.</b> There are <b>ongoing</b> schemes that aim to foster disease resistance in trees {{such as the}} American chestnut (see Chestnut blight) and the English elm (see Dutch elm disease) {{for the purpose of}} their reintroduction to the wild. Specific diseases have reduced the populations of these emblematic species {{to the extent that they}} are mostly lost in the wild. Genetic modification is being pursued concurrently with traditional breeding techniques in an attempt to endow these species with disease resistance.|$|R
40|$|The University of Florida has <b>underway</b> an <b>ongoing</b> {{research}} program {{to validate the}} economic, operational and performance benefits of developing an inert matrix fuel (IMF) for the disposition of the U. S. weapons plutonium (Pu) and for the recycle of reprocessed Pu. The current fuel form of choice for Pu disposition for the Department of Energy is as a mixed oxide (MOX) (PuO 2 /UO 2). We will show analyses that demonstrate that a Silicon Carbide (SiC) IMF offers improved performance capabilities as a fuel form for Pu recycle and disposition. The reason that UF is reviewing various materials {{to serve as an}} inert matrix fuel is that an IMF fuel form can offer greatly reduced Pu and transuranic isotope (TRU) production and also improved thermal performance characteristics. Our studies showed that the Pu content is reduced by an order of magnitude while centerline fuel temperatures are reduced approximately 380 degrees centigrade compared to MOX. These reduced temperatures result in reduced stored heat and thermal stresses in the pellet. The reduced stored heat reduces the consequences of the loss of coolant accident, while the reduced temperatures and thermal stresses yield greatly improved fuel performance. Silicon Carbide is not new to the nuclear industry, being a basic fuel material in gas cooled reactors...|$|R
5000|$|In {{one of the}} {{adjacent}} [...] "Chinese" [...] wings, are four rooms decorated with circa 1775 Chinese hand-crafted wallpaper, which came from Canton workshops, specialized for export, and represented the important influence of the chinoiserie style then being experienced throughout Europe. The refined paintings of the China wing represent an idealized world of flowers, exotic birds and scenes of daily Chinese life, often borrowed from the period literature depicting Chinese life and culture. A fifth room contained, originally, 88 pictures (about 20 × 30 cm each) which were displayed with these various scenes from Chinese life. These probably came from a collection {{that was in the}} villa from about 1784. Today, only about twenty are displayed, with their repair and reconditioning being <b>underway</b> in an <b>ongoing</b> restoration project, which will eventually recreate their original layout.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{began to}} {{modernize}} the locks on the Ohio River and added 1200 ft chambers that permit a typical tow to pass in a single lockage. This modernization process continues today {{with the construction of}} a new dam with twin 1200 ft locks at Olmsted, Illinois located at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and a second 1200 ft chamber at McAlpine Locks and Dam near Louisville. Modern 1200 ft chambers are also being constructed at Kentucky Lock on the Tennessee River and at the Inner Harbor Lock on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway at New Orleans. Other projects are underway in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Arkansas. In addition, several major rehabilitations are also <b>underway.</b> Altogether, this <b>ongoing</b> work represents an investment of over $3.5 billion in inland waterway modernization that will be completed over the next decade. Half this investment will come from fuel taxes paid by the inland towing industry. These projects include not only modern navigation facilities, but also important investments in environmental restoration and management.|$|R
40|$|A {{shift from}} {{conventional}} forest management to community forestry is arguably development of forest management of many Southeast Asian {{countries in the}} last few decades. This study aims to provide a picture of community forestry models in Southeast Asia and Cambodia and draw upon what Cambodia can learn from experience of Southeast Asia. The study demonstrates that, based on the types of land use certificate issued to participants, community forestry programs in Southeast Asia can be classified into three types: （ 1 ）community forestry programs in which land use certificates are issued to individuals, （ 2 ） community forestry programs in which land use certificates are issued to communities and （ 3 ） community forestry programs as forest protection contracts. In Cambodia land use certificates in community forestry are issued only to communities. The study suggests that mechanisms for granting forest protection contracts and land use certificate to individuals in community-based forest management such as those found in Southeast Asia can also be applicable for Cambodia. The study also argues that although community forestry models in Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Philippines, Indonesia are those that emerged from their own social, economic and geographical conditions, most of them tend to have five key elements in common. These include 1) well-organized community organization, 2 ） security of rights on land and tree resources, 3 ） economic benefits to the rural community, 4 ） on-going evaluation and monitoring and 5 ） strong support from NGOs, central and local government. In Cambodia, however, many projects are <b>underway</b> without <b>ongoing</b> evaluation and monitoring. Thus, more efforts should be made to ensure that all projects are adequately evaluated and monitored in order to improve project implementation and to provide policy makers with data and information for future actions...|$|R
40|$|Ongoing {{experiments}} and projects to test {{our understanding of}} fundamental inter- actions and symmetries in nature have progressed significantly {{in the past few}} years. At high energies the long searched for Higgs boson has been found; tests of gravity for antimatter have come closer to reality; Lorentz invariance - up to now very well tested in electromag- netic interactions - is now being challenged in dedicated experiments in weak interactions as well; discrete symmetries are scrutinized in experiments on C, P, T, CP, and CPT through searches for permanent electric dipole moments and precise measurements of atomic parity violation and in precision measurements involving antiprotons; a new generation of pre- cise flavor symmetry tests is coming up; and last but not least precision measurements of Standard Model values of im portant fundamental constants and quan tities such as the muon magnetic anomaly are <b>underway.</b> All the <b>ongoing</b> projects in this most active field have a robust potential for discovery of New Physics, i. e. physics not yet covered by the well estab- lished Standard Model of particle physics. Antip rotons have a central position in this lively field with many new and novel upcoming {{experiments and}} facilitie...|$|R
