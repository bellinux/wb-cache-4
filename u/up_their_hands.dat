5|$|Sheriff Behan, testifying for the prosecution, {{said the}} Cowboys had not resisted, but had thrown <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> and turned out their coats {{to show they}} were not armed. He said that Tom McLaury threw open his coat {{to show that he}} was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Sheriff Behan insisted Doc Holliday had fired first using a {{nickel-plated}} revolver, although other witnesses reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand.|$|E
5|$|The University of Houston and the University of Texas {{played their}} first {{football}} game {{against one another}} in 1953. Since this was their first meeting, members of Alpha Phi Omega—the service fraternity in charge {{of taking care of}} ShastaI, the university's mascot—brought her to the game. During the trip, Shasta's front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off. At the game, several Longhorn players saw what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> with the ring finger bent, suggesting the Cougars were invalids. Texas went on to win this game 28–7. UH students had been using the victory sign as a hand signal up to that time, but began using the bent-finger sign as a reminder that they would remember the taunts.|$|E
25|$|Bull and Fox {{captured}} Spillman with no incident, {{and placed}} him {{in the custody of}} several miners while the two continued to search for the others. Locating them in a large tent used as a saloon, Bull stepped inside with a double barrel shotgun, and demanded both men throw <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> and surrender. Arnett immediately grabbed his pistol laying on the table beside him, at which point Bull shot him with one blast from his shotgun in the chest, killing him instantly. Jermagin surrendered, and he and Spillman were tried the next morning in a makeshift court. Jermagin was able to successfully argue that he played no part in the horse theft. However, Spillman was convicted and sentenced to hang. The next morning he was executed.|$|E

500|$|Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan testified on {{the third}} day of the hearing. During two days on the stand, he gave strong {{testimony}} that the Cowboys had not resisted but either threw <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> and turned out their coats to show they were not armed. Behan's views turned public opinion against the Earps, who were free on bail. He and other prosecution witnesses testified that Tom McLaury was unarmed, that Billy Clanton had his hands in the air, and that neither of the McLaurys were troublemakers. They portrayed Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury as being unjustly bullied and beaten by the vengeful Earps {{on the day of the}} gunfight. On the strength of the prosecution case, Spicer revoked the bail for Doc and Wyatt Earp and had them jailed on November 7. [...] They spent the next 16 days in jail.|$|E
500|$|On the 7thJune, 1917, while {{disguised}} as a British merchant vessel with a dummy gun mounted aft, H.M.S. [...] "Pargust" [...] was torpedoed at very close range. Her boiler-room, engine-room, and No. 5 hold were immediately flooded, and the starboard lifeboat was blown to pieces. The weather was misty at the time, fresh breeze and a choppy sea. The [...] "Panic Party", {{under the command of}} Lieutenant F. R. Hereford, D.S.C., R.N.R., abandoned ship, and as the last boat was shoving off, the periscope of the submarine was observed close before the port beam about 400 yards distant. The enemy then submerged, and periscope reappeared directly astern, passing to the starboard quarter, and then round to the port beam, when it turned again towards the ship, breaking surface about 50 yards away. The lifeboat, acting as a lure, commenced to pull round the stern; submarine followed closely and Lieutenant Hereford, with complete disregard of the danger incurred from the fire of either ship or submarine (who had trained a maxim on the lifeboat), continued to decoy her to within 50 yards of the ship. The [...] "Pargust" [...] then opened fire with all guns, and the submarine, with oil squirting from her side and the crew pouring out of the conning tower, steamed slowly across the bows with a heavy list. The enemy crew held <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> in token of surrender, whereupon fire immediately ceased. The submarine then began to move away at a gradually increasing speed, apparently endeavouring to escape in the mist. Fire was reopened until she sank, one man clinging to the bow as she went down. The boats, after a severe pull to the windward, succeeded in saving one officer and one man. American Destroyers and a British sloop arrived shortly afterwards, and the [...] "Pargust" [...] was towed back to port. As on the previous occasions, officers and men displayed the utmost courage and confidence in their captain, and the action serves as an example of what perfect discipline, when coupled with such confidence, can achieve.|$|E

2500|$|In 1586, Thomas Churche married Anne Mainwaring, {{who came}} from another {{prominent}} Nantwich family.

[...] They are also probably the subject of portraits {{on two of the}} present building's corbels. Thomas Churche died in 1635, and is buried in St Mary's Church. His will describes the house, bequeathed to his wife (who died in 1639), as [...] "my Messuage or Burgage lyinge and beinge in Wich Malbank".

2500|$|The {{prosecution}} presented considerable {{evidence in}} an attempt to bind the Earps and Holliday over for trial. On {{the second day of the}} hearings, William Allen testified for the prosecution that [...] "the firing commenced by the Earp party. I think it was Doc Holliday who fired first." [...] Johnny Behan testified that he tried to prevent the confrontation. I [...] "told them...I was down there for the purpose of disarming the Clantons and McLaurys. They wouldn't heed me, paid no attention. And I said, 'Gentleman, I am Sheriff of this County, and I am not going to allow any trouble if I can help it.' They brushed past me." [...] He said Cowboys had put <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> or thrown open their coats to show they weren't armed, and that Doc Holliday had fired first. He testified that the first five shots had come from the Earps. He clearly blamed the Earps and Doc Holliday for instigating the shootout.|$|E

2500|$|At {{midnight on}} Saturday 8 February 1879, Ned Kelly, Dan Kelly, Hart and Byrne {{surrounded}} the Jerilderie police barracks. Constables George Denis Devine and Henry Richards were on duty that night. Hart, {{in a loud}} voice, shouted, [...] "Devine, there's a drunken man at Davidson's Hotel, who has committed murder. Get up at once, all of you." [...] Richards, who was sleeping {{at the rear of}} the premises, came to the front door. Devine opened the door, meeting Kelly who told him there was a great row at Davidson's. Devine approached Kelly, who once he established there were no other policemen, pointed two revolvers at the policemen, introduced the gang, telling the officers to hold <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b> Immediately the police were pounced upon by the other men and placed in the lock-up cell, and Mrs Devine and children were held hostage in the sitting-room. Afterwards Ned stole all the firearms and ammunition and toured the house with Devine to make certain there were no other policemen. After this, he let her and the children turn in to sleep as usual, and with the rest of the gang went into the sitting room, where they kept watch till morning.|$|E

This put the country ten solar years behind the standard Muslim calendar. However, according to the 2006 Encyclopedia of the Developing World, [...] "More confusing still is Qaddafi's unique Libyan calendar, which counts the years from the Prophet's birth, or sometimes from his death.

[...] Reflecting on a 2001 visit to the country, American reporter Neil MacFarquhar observed, [...] "Life in Libya was so unpredictable that people weren't even sure what year it was.
