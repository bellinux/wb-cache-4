5|$|A {{high blood}} {{prolactin}} level {{within the first}} 20 minutes following a seizure may be <b>useful</b> to help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. Serum prolactin level is less <b>useful</b> for detecting focal seizures. If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope. It is not recommended as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Although this {{definition}} can be <b>useful</b> for concrete problems, {{it is far}} too complicated to produce elegant general proofs; {{there are too many}} cases to consider.|$|E
5|$|As a metal, {{beryllium}} is transparent to most {{wavelengths of}} X-rays and gamma rays, making it <b>useful</b> for the output windows of X-ray tubes {{and other such}} apparatus.|$|E
5|$|As {{a simple}} {{polyhedron}} with 180 triangular faces (60 isosceles, 120 scalene), 270 edges, and 92 vertices. This interpretation is <b>useful</b> for polyhedron model building.|$|E
5|$|Because denser {{materials}} absorb more radioactive emissions than lighter ones, {{heavy metals}} are <b>useful</b> for radiation shielding and to focus radiation beams in linear accelerators and radiotherapy applications.|$|E
5|$|Bede's {{work as a}} hagiographer, and his {{detailed}} {{attention to}} dating, were both <b>useful</b> preparations for the task of writing the Historia Ecclesiastica. His interest in computus, the science of calculating the date of Easter, was also <b>useful</b> in the account he gives of the controversy between the British and Anglo-Saxon church over the correct method of obtaining the Easter date.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is an {{antibiotic}} <b>useful</b> {{for the treatment}} of a number of bacterial infections. This includes middle ear infections, bone or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, and endocarditis among others. It can be <b>useful</b> against some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It may also be used for acne and in addition to quinine for malaria. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and as a cream to be applied to the skin or in the vagina.|$|E
5|$|Desilylation is also <b>useful</b> for {{the removal}} of silyl {{protecting}} groups.|$|E

5|$|Erectile {{dysfunction}}: {{erectile dysfunction}} {{is common in}} male patients with MS. There is some evidence indicating that sildenafil citrate may be a <b>useful</b> treatment.|$|E
5|$|Euler's {{notation}} is <b>useful</b> for stating {{and solving}} linear differential equations.|$|E
5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it is <b>useful</b> {{to define}} a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more <b>useful</b> reference is the Earth itself, which {{is assumed to be}} at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} infections {{are related to}} intercourse, taking {{antibiotics}} afterwards may be <b>useful.</b> In post-menopausal women, topical vaginal estrogen {{has been found to}} reduce recurrence. As opposed to topical creams, the use of vaginal estrogen from pessaries has not been as <b>useful</b> as low dose antibiotics. Antibiotics following short term urinary catheterization decreases the subsequent risk of a bladder infection. A number of vaccines are in development as of 2011.|$|E
5|$|In short, Cobb {{does not}} {{conceive}} of dialogue as <b>useful</b> primarily to convert or be converted, {{but rather as}} <b>useful</b> in order to transform both parties mutually, allowing for a broadening of ideas and a reimagining of each faith in order that they might better face {{the challenges of the}} modern world.|$|E
5|$|Its {{physical}} characteristics and chemical stability make it <b>useful</b> for industrial applications. Its {{resistance to wear}} and tarnish is well suited to use in fine jewellery.|$|E
5|$|Mouthguards {{and other}} {{physical}} protective devices may be <b>useful</b> in preventing {{damage to the}} lips and tongue due to the orofacial chorea and dystonia typical of chorea acanthocytosis.|$|E
5|$|Polydopamine {{coatings}} {{can form}} on objects {{ranging in size}} from nanoparticles to large surfaces. Polydopamine layers have chemical properties that have the potential to be extremely <b>useful,</b> and numerous studies have examined their possible applications. At the simplest level, they can be used for protection against damage by light, or to form capsules for drug delivery. At a more sophisticated level, their adhesive properties may make them <b>useful</b> as substrates for biosensors or other biologically active macromolecules.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium plated {{by either}} {{electroplating}} or evaporation is extremely hard and <b>useful</b> for optical instruments.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other uses}} have been {{researched}} for bupropion. There has been controversy {{about whether it}} is <b>useful</b> to add an antidepressant such as bupropion to a mood stabilizer in people with bipolar depression, but recent reviews have concluded that bupropion in this situation does no significant harm and may sometimes give significant benefit. Bupropion has shown no effectiveness {{in the treatment of}} cocaine dependence, but there is weak evidence that it may be <b>useful</b> in treating methamphetamine dependence. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be <b>useful</b> in treating inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion—like other antidepressants, with the exception of duloxetine (Cymbalta)—is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. It does, however, show some promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{internal}} fuel capacity was low limiting the <b>useful</b> {{range of the}} aircraft, extra capacity was provided on later versions by lengthening the forward fuselage.|$|E
5|$|Surgery may be <b>useful</b> {{in those}} with a herniated disc that is causing {{significant}} pain radiating into the leg, significant leg weakness, bladder problems, or loss of bowel control. It may also be <b>useful</b> {{in those with}} spinal stenosis. In the absence of these issues, {{there is no clear}} evidence of a benefit from surgery.|$|E

5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{has been}} used to perform {{systematic}} studies of Mars and has taken the highest resolution images of Mars ever captured from Earth. This telescope can produce <b>useful</b> images of the planet when it is at an angular distance of at least 50° from the Sun. The HST can take images of a hemisphere, which yields views of entire weather systems. Earth-based telescopes equipped with charge-coupled devices can produce <b>useful</b> images of Mars, allowing for regular monitoring of the planet's weather during oppositions.|$|E
5|$|The concept now named Galileo's paradox was not {{original}} with him. His proposed solution, that infinite numbers {{cannot be}} compared, {{is no longer}} considered <b>useful.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{extraction}} of the <b>useful</b> components of oil shale usually takes place above ground (ex-situ processing), although several newer technologies perform this underground (on-site or in-situ processing).|$|E

5|$|The theatre's {{capacity}} is 1,216seats on four levels. Really <b>Useful</b> Theatres Group purchased it in January 2000 with nine other London theatres formerly {{owned by the}} Stoll-Moss Group. Between 1990 and 1993, renovation and improvements {{were made by the}} H.L.M. and C. G. Twelves partnership. In 2014, Really <b>Useful</b> Theatres split-off from the Really <b>Useful</b> Group and owns the theatre.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} modern editions of Sherman's memoirs. The edition most <b>useful</b> for {{research}} purposes is the 1990 Library of America version, edited by Charles Royster. It contains the entire text of Sherman's 1886 edition, together with annotations, {{a note on the}} text, and a detailed chronology of Sherman's life. Missing from this edition is the <b>useful</b> biographical material contained in the 1891 Johnson and Blaine editions.|$|E
