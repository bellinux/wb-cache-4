25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and <b>upper</b> <b>door</b> trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} small square-panelled {{doors to the}} north wall of the chancel. One is {{at the base of}} the former rood loft stair, and this may be {{followed}} up a mural staircase built into the thickness of the wall, to a second door, which is high on the wall to the left. This would have been the entrance to the rood loft itself. The two doors are of slightly different style; the lower door has a triangular form not seen elsewhere in the church, suggesting early Tudor work. The <b>upper</b> <b>door,</b> which would originally have led to a loft, is a four-centred arch, possibly late Gothic, probably late fifteenth to early sixteenth century. The two could be contemporaneous with the work in the rest of the chancel.|$|E
2500|$|Concours was {{the most}} luxurious Chevrolet compact to date. Rosewood vinyl {{decorated}} the <b>upper</b> <b>door</b> panels, instrument panel, and steering wheel. Concours models had an upright hood ornament, bumper guards, bright trim moldings, black bumper impact strips, and full wheel covers; more-basic Novas came with hubcaps. [...] The Concours coupe also was the first Chevrolet coupe with a fold-down front center armrest. A V-8 Concours coupe sold for $547 more than the comparable base Nova. [...] Engines for the 1976 Chevrolet Nova were a 105-horsepower inline-six, a 165-horsepower 350-cubic-inch V-8, or a 140-horse 305-cubic-inch V-8. 1976 GM vehicles first saw use of the THM200 â€” from the GM T platform to GM X-Bodies (Chevrolet Nova et al.). A Cabriolet padded vinyl top was available for Nova coupes. Modest revisions {{were made to the}} brakes, and also to fuel and exhaust system mountings. Dashboards contained new knobs. [...] After testing the 1976 Chevrolet Nova, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department placed the largest order for compact police cars ever seen in the U.S.|$|E

5000|$|These {{buildings}} {{may have}} influenced Pabst, but the most direct influence {{seems to have been}} British designer Bruce James Talbert. Talbert's Gothic Forms Applied to Furniture, Metal Work and Decoration for Domestic Purposes was published in Boston in 1873. The Pabst cabinet's [...] "roof," [...] columns, and corbels are closely related to a Talbert wall cupboard (plate 12, below); and the cameo-carved panels of its <b>upper</b> <b>doors</b> seem to be copied from the doors of a Talbert cabinet (plate 20, below).|$|R
60|$|In pursuance of {{this last}} {{understanding}} the worthy gentlemen went out together shortly afterwards, and Newman Noggs emerged, bottle in hand, from the cupboard, {{out of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>door</b> of which, at the imminent risk of detection, he had more than once thrust his red nose when such parts of the subject were under discussion as interested him most.|$|E
60|$|Rooney {{seemed to}} have {{opened the front door}} below and engaged the police in conference in the dark hall. The wordless low growl of their voices came up the stairway.

60|$|The scuttle-box on the {{submarine}} vessel was a contrivance for throwing things overboard. It {{consisted of a}} steel box about six feet long and two feet square at the ends, and with a tightly fitting door at each extremity. When this scuttle-box was used it was run down through a square opening {{in the bottom of}} the Dipsey, the <b>upper</b> <b>door</b> was opened, matter to be disposed of was thrown into it, the <b>upper</b> <b>door</b> was shut and the lower one opened, whereupon everything inside of it descended into the sea, and water filled the box. When this box was drawn up by means of its machinery, the water was forced out, so that when it was entirely inside the vessel it was empty, and then the lower door was closed. For some moments the idea suggested by Sammy was very attractive to Clewe, and he could not help thinking that the occasion might arise when it would be perfectly proper to carry it into execution.|$|E

50|$|A lack of {{pressurization}} in the stairwell, {{the absence}} of fire-stopping on service shafts, and few self-closers installed on <b>upper</b> level <b>doors</b> had allowed toxic smoke to penetrate the 3rd to 16th floors and asphyxiate {{many of the people}} residing there.

60|$|Bertie {{put on an}} old {{overcoat}} {{and took}} a lantern. He went out from the side door. He shrank from the wet and roaring night. Such weather had a nervous effect on him: too much moisture everywhere made him feel almost imbecile. Unwilling, he went through it all. A dog barked violently at him. He peered in all the buildings. At last, {{as he opened the}} <b>upper</b> <b>door</b> of a sort of intermediate barn, he heard a grinding noise, and looking in, holding up his lantern, saw Maurice, in his shirt-sleeves, standing listening, holding the handle of a turnip-pulper. He had been pulping sweet roots, a pile of which lay dimly heaped in a corner behind him.|$|E
60|$|When Elizabeth's head rose {{through the}} trap she {{perceived}} that the <b>upper</b> <b>door</b> was open, and that her stepfather and Farfrae stood just within it in conversation, Farfrae being nearest the dizzy edge, and Henchard a little way behind. Not to interrupt them she remained on the steps without raising her head any higher. While waiting thus she saw--or fancied she saw, for she had a terror of feeling certain--her stepfather slowly raise his hand to a level behind Farfrae's shoulders, a curious expression taking possession of his face. The young man was quite unconscious of the action, which was so indirect that, if Farfrae had observed it, he might almost have regarded it as an idle outstretching of the arm. But {{it would have been}} possible, by a comparatively light touch, to push Farfrae off his balance, and send him head over heels into the air.|$|E

60|$|At {{this point}} Julian's {{thoughts}} became confused. The {{voices of the}} men talking at the table seemed to get further and further away, {{and then he was}} conscious of nothing more until he heard a bell tinkle faintly somewhere overhead. There was a movement in the cave, and he sat up. All the men went out by the <b>upper</b> <b>door.</b> When they had left he {{got up and went to}} see if the lower door was so fastened that he could not open it. He had no idea of breaking his word, but did so out of curiosity rather than from any other feeling. He found that the bolts could be pulled back, but that the lock was a very strong one, and the jamb was, at the point where the bolt shot into it, covered with a piece of iron, so that no instrument could be used for forcing back the bolt.|$|E
6000|$|At the end {{of three}} days the facchino-doctor-brigadier was ready. I was also ready, with a stenographer. We were in a room called the Rope-Walk. This is a formidably long room, as is {{indicated}} by its facetious name, and {{is a good place}} for reviews. At 9:30 the F.-D.-B. took his place near me and gave the word of command; the drums began to rumble and thunder, the head of the forces appeared at an <b>upper</b> <b>door,</b> and the [...] "march-past" [...] was on. Down they filed, a blaze of variegated color, each squad gaudy in a uniform of its own and bearing a banner inscribed with its verbal rank and quality: first the Present Tense in Mediterranean blue and old gold, then the Past Definite in scarlet and black, then the Imperfect in green and yellow, then the Indicative Future in the stars and stripes, then the Old Red Sandstone Subjunctive in purple and silver--and so on and so on, fifty-seven privates and twenty commissioned and non-commissioned officers; certainly one of the most fiery and dazzling and eloquent sights I have ever beheld. I could not keep back the tears. Presently: ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were two}} doors {{by which the}} White Parlour was entered from the hall, and they were both {{standing}} open {{for the sake of}} air; but the lower one was crowded with the servants and villagers, and only the upper doorway was left free. Bob Cass was figuring in a hornpipe, and his father, very proud of this lithe son, whom he repeatedly declared to be just like himself in his young days in a tone that implied this to be the very highest stamp of juvenile merit, was the centre of a group who had placed themselves opposite the performer, not far from the <b>upper</b> <b>door.</b> Godfrey was standing a little way off, not to admire his brother's dancing, but to keep sight of Nancy, who was seated in the group, near her father. He stood aloof, because he wished to avoid suggesting himself as a subject for the Squire's fatherly jokes in connection with matrimony and Miss Nancy Lammeter's beauty, which were likely to become more and more explicit. But he had the prospect of dancing with her again when the hornpipe was concluded, and in the meanwhile it was very pleasant to get long glances at her quite unobserved.|$|E

60|$|I suppose {{enjoyment}} {{would have}} a simple zest which it often lacks if we always did things at the moment we want to, for it's mostly when we can't that we're thoroughly sure we would, and we can answer too little for moods in the future conditional. Winter at least {{seemed to me to}} have put something into these seats of antiquity that the May sun had more or less melted away--a desirable strength of tone, a depth upon depth of queerness and quaintness. Assisi had been in the January twilight, after my mere snatch at Narni, a vignette out of some brown old missal. But you'll have to be a fearless explorer now to find of a fine spring day any such cluster of curious objects as doesn't seem made to match before anything else Mr. Baedeker's polyglot estimate of its chief recommendations. This great man was at Assisi in force, and a brand-new inn for his accommodation has just been opened cheek by jowl with the church of St. Francis. I don't know that even the dire discomfort of this harbourage makes it seem less impertinent; but I confess I sought its protection, and the great view seemed hardly less beautiful from my window than from the gallery of the convent. This view embraces the whole wide reach of Umbria, which becomes as twilight deepens a purple counterfeit of the misty sea. The visitor's first errand is with the church; and it's fair furthermore to admit that when he has crossed that threshold the position and quality of his hotel cease for the time to be matters of moment. This two-fold temple of St. Francis is one of the very sacred places of Italy, and {{it would be hard to}} breathe anywhere an air more heavy with holiness. Such seems especially the case if you happen thus to have come from Rome, where everything ecclesiastical is, in aspect, so very much of this world--so florid, so elegant, so full of accommodations and excrescences. The mere site here makes for authority, and they were brave builders who laid the foundation-stones. The thing rises straight from a steep mountain-side and plunges forward on its great substructure of arches even as a crowned headland may frown over the main. Before it stretches a long, grassy piazza, at the end of which you look up a small grey street, to see it first climb a little way the rest of the hill and then pause and leave a broad green slope, crested, high in the air, with a ruined castle. When I say before it I mean before the upper church; for by way of doing something supremely handsome and impressive the sturdy architects of the thirteenth century piled temple upon temple and bequeathed a double version of their idea. One may imagine them to have intended perhaps an architectural image of the relation between heart and head. Entering the lower church at the bottom of the great flight of steps which leads from the <b>upper</b> <b>door,</b> you seem to push at least into the very heart of Catholicism.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{modifications}} is a [...] "chopped top". The trend began in the 1950s, and is not limited to three-windows by any means.

The process requires new glass, relocation of <b>upper</b> <b>door</b> hinges, and raked (tilted back) A-pillars to meet the roof of the car.|$|E
50|$|In Pursuit of Beauty, a major {{exhibition}} of Aesthetic Movement decorative arts, was mounted at MMA in 1986. The cover of its catalogue was {{a photograph of}} the cabinet. Contributor Marilynn Johnson wrote:The most successful American interpretations of the Talbert style of Modern Gothic furniture were apparently the result of a collaboration between a highly skilled Philadelphia cabinetmaker and carver, DANIEL PABST, and FRANK FURNESS, a Philadelphia architect. Furniture believed to have been produced by Pabst and Furness includes a desk that was handed down in the Furness family, at least two suites of furniture owned by Theodore Roosevelt, and, most impressive of all, a cabinet that has only recently come to light. Its rooflike pediment, angular base, chamfered edges, truncated columns, elaborate strap hinges, and decorated door panels all link this cabinet to the Modern Gothic furniture of British architect-designers such as Burges. The scrolling, finely carved brackets, however, specifically suggest the form of Talbert's wall cupboard, and the cutaway pattern of stylized flowers on the <b>upper</b> <b>doors</b> is reminiscent of the decoration on a sideboard that relates closely to the Holland and Sons sideboard of 1867 and is illustrated as number 20 in Gothic Forms. Talbert's work may well have been the source for the design of the cabinet.|$|R
