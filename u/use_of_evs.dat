50|$|To {{encourage}} the public transport sector to use EVs, the government offers the industry some financial assistance programs, for example, “Pilot Green Transport Fund”(See the above section). Such a fund targets {{public transport service}} providers and attracts them to use innovative and green technologies for trial. Furthermore, other financial assistances are put in place like the one-off grant to PLB owners and the allocation of $180 million HKD for franchised bus runners to purchase electric buses. The former aims to upgrade PLB emission standard to that of EV while the latter serves to test the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>EVs</b> and promote the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>EVs</b> among the community.|$|E

50|$|Giving {{economic}} incentives {{is regarded as}} a favourable policy that encourages the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>EVs</b> as it lowers the costs. Exemption of the first registration tax on EVs was first introduced in 1997 to promote the use of greener vehicles. The Financial Secretary extended the waiver of the first registration tax on purchasing EVs in 2009 Budget until the end of March 2017. Moreover, enterprises purchasing EVs will enjoy another tax deduction, which is a full “profits tax reduction for the capital expenditure on the EVs {{in the first year of}} procurement”.|$|E
50|$|The {{emphasis}} of Singaporean government’s EVs policy {{is placed on}} the cooperation with vehicle manufacturers and technology companies. By launching EV test-bed and forming agreement with Chinese companies to introduce EV into their public transportation, the determination of the government to utilize EVs as environmental policy to combat air pollution is clearly shown. However, surprisingly, as opposed to Hong Kong, the most popular EV model in Singapore is not Tesla. One may suggest the biggest obstacles come from the international oil company, which considers Singapore as the hub of oil refinement and trading center, hence acting as the tripping stone for the government to continuously promote the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>EVs.</b>|$|E
50|$|In March 1994, the {{government}} has first waived the First Registration Tax for EVs aiming to {{encourage the use of}} it in Hong Kong. It has been extended for several times, and the latest one lasts until end of March 2017. However, EVs are yet to be popular in Hong Kong. Since 2009-10 Policy Address, a series of schemes and policies have been implemented by {{the government}} to actively promote and encourage the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>EVs.</b> In order to coordinate the work in promoting EVs, the Steering Committee on the Promotion of Electric Vehicles was set up in April 2012. The committee is chaired by the Financial Secretary with 2-year terms, along with 16 other members from professionals or government departments.|$|E
40|$|Inevitability <b>of</b> <b>using</b> {{evidentials}} (<b>EVs)</b> {{and references}} in all academic writings signifies {{the importance of}} distinguishing and applying EVs for those who attempt to write in academic prose.

The proposed model yields at least two important advantages. First, it can develop a pattern <b>of</b> the <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>EVs</b> in academic texts, thus deepening {{our understanding of the}} organization of such texts.

30|$|According to the {{government}} program, the current tax benefits for the purchase and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>EVs</b> will be sustained until the year 2017, {{as long as the}} number of EVs in road traffic does not exceed 50 000 vehicles. Perhaps because of this limit, the last 3  years have seen an explosion in the purchase and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>EVs</b> in Norway, as observed in Fig. 1; consumers are striving to enjoy the tax benefits of EVs while they still can, and they are not necessarily being environmentally friendly. With the entry of Tesla in the EV market and the emerging battery technology that allows EVs to continually cover longer distances, the total cost of owning an EV is also becoming favorable in terms of distance covered compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E

30|$|From the {{discussion}} above, {{it is quite}} clear that the sole incentive behind the formidable increase in the purchase and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>EVs</b> in Norway is economic motivations, whereby EV road transport users (EV car users) obtain financial gains {{that would not be}} possible {{with the use of a}} conventional vehicle.|$|E

Direct links occur between encouraging active learning and giving prompt feedback, by removing the lack of anonymity to responding in class and rapid collation of student re-sponses to questions.

This is particularly interesting because Oslo has a cordon toll system, where motorists pay tolls yet the impact of increasing EV usage given that one incentive for purchase is exempting EVs from tolls has not been previously studied in the literature. From a transportation research perspective, the prevailing situation in Norway, and in Oslo in particular, with regards to the purchase and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>EVs</b> raises several questions e.g., whether the incentives to EV purchase and use are economically effective and efficient.

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} (EVs) {{have been}} discussed as a promising alternative to conventional cars and as a potential solution for mitigating environmental problems caused by road transport.

The results suggest that EVs meet the mobility needs of different commercial users, bringing reputational and environmental related benefits for the companies. Main challenges for the deployment of EVs are related rather to the periphery of the EVs (e. g., infrastructure, market characteristics, and lack of experts in related service sectors as well as psychological barriers).
