5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, <b>urinary</b> <b>retention,</b> and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and <b>urinary</b> <b>retention.</b> Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E

From February 2009 to June 2010, 14 patients with prostate cancer recurrence after radiotherapy were selected for HIFU treatment; all patients had a positive TRUS-guided biopsy and the absence of distant metastases was confirmed by computer tomography, PET choline or bone scintigraphy. We classified all patients in 3 groups using D'Amico's classification: 4 patients high risk (PSA[*]> 20 ng/ml - 8 ≤[*]Gleason Score≤[*] 10 - clinical stage≥T 2 c), 8 patients intermediate risk (10 [*] PSAnadir+ 1. 2 ng/ml) or after adjuvant therapy introduction.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to present the results of pubovaginal sling with a {{low-cost}} polypropylene mesh in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence MATERIALS AND METHODS: 118 women diagnosed with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) due to urethral hypermobility or intrinsic sphincteric deficiency, treated with pubovaginal sling (PVS) with a low-cost polypropylene mesh confectioned by the surgeon, were analyzed. All patients had a basic evaluation that included a medical history, physical examination, stress tests and urodynamic investigation RESULTS: The average follow up was of 42 months. Urethral hypermobility was observed in 67 % of the cases. The process was carried out on an outpatient basis on 67 patients. Intra-operative complications included 4 vesical injuries, treated with catheterization for 3 days. There were 13 early complications, of which 8 were <b>urinary</b> <b>retentions</b> treated with vesical drainage for 1 to 3 weeks and 3 vaginal extrusions of the mesh treated with covering of the sections with mucous membrane. There was a need for 6 urethrolysis in patients who presented irritative and postoperative obstructive symptoms; 81. 3 % of the patients were considered cured, while 9. 3 % had significant improvement. Three initially unsuccessful cases required sling reconfiguration. All cases were eventually cured CONCLUSION: The construction of a pubovaginal sling using a low-cost polypropylene mesh is a safe and effective technique for the relief of SUI. It should be considered an alternative, especially for patients in public health systems with low financial resources...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{treatment}} of trans-sphincteric fistulas is a surgical challenge since eradicating the fistula tract {{while maintaining the}} anal continence is vitally important. In this study we documented the outcomes of the patients {{with one or more}} fistulas treated at the same operation with a new type of seton. Patients and Methods: The study included 78 patients with 107 high anal fistulas who were treated with seton between 2007 and 2011. Fifty seven patients had only one fistula, 13 patients had two isolated fistulas and 8 patients had three isolated fistulas. Group I was the patients with one fistula and Group II was the patients having more than one fistula. Postoperative complications, hospital stay, cutting through the sphincter and healing times and Wexner’s scores were compared between the two groups. Results: In Group I, there were 57 patients and in Group II, 21 patients were operated for 50 fistulas. No postoperative complications were observed except <b>urinary</b> <b>retentions</b> (4 patients in Group I, 3 patients in Group II). No infection on the operation site was documented in both groups, in Group I none of the patients needed extra dose of narcotic analgesic but in Group II two of the patients who had 3 fistulas were discharged on the second postoperative day because of pain on the operation site. The median for the cutting seton to cut through the sphincter was 31 days and complete healing was achieved with a median of 40 days in Group I, whereas it was 56 and 65 days respectively for Group II. There were no recurrences in our patients in both groups. Although the Wexner scores of the both groups were low, the difference between the groups was statistically significant. Conclusion: It seems to be feasible to perform seton by using a cheap, effective, easily inserted material, also in {{treatment of}} patients with more than one fistula while preserving anal continence. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundHaemorrhoidectomy is a {{frequently}} performed {{surgical procedure}} and associated with postprocedural pain. The {{use of the}} Ligasure {{may result in a}} decreased incidence of pain as coagulation with high frequency current and active feedback control over the power output results in minimal thermal spread and limited tissue charring. MethodsA multi-database systematic search was conducted to identify trials randomizing conventional and Ligasure haemorrhoidectomy. Key journals were hand searched. There was no restriction on language. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Odd Ratios were generated for dichotomous variables. Weight Mean Differences were used for analysing continuous variables. Only random effects models were used. Heterogeneity was explored by sensitivity analysis. ResultsTwelve studies with 1142 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pain score at the first day following surgery was significantly less in the Ligasure group (10 studies, 835 patients, WMD − 2. 07 CI − 2. 77 to − 1. 38). The benefit was diminished at day 14 (VAS pain score, 4 studies, 183 patients, WMD − 0. 12 CI − 0. 37 to 0. 12). The conventional technique took significantly longer to complete (11 trials, 9. 15 minutes, CI 3. 21 to 15. 09). Significantly less <b>urinary</b> <b>retentions</b> and less delayed wound healing were noted following Ligasure haemorrhoidectomy. There was no relevant difference in other postoperative complications, symptoms of recurrent bleeding or incontinence at final follow-up. Hospital stay was similar for both groups. Patients treated with the Ligasure-technique returned to work significantly earlier (4 studies, 451 patients, 4. 88 days, CI 2. 18 to 7. 59). Sensitivity analysis in case of considerable heterogeneity distinguished closed from open conventional technique. ConclusionSince the usage of the Ligasure technique results in significantly less immediate postoperative pain after haemorrhoidectomy without any adverse effect on postoperative complications, convalescence and incontinence-rate, this technique is superior in terms of patient tolerance. Although there was a tendency for equal efficacy, more evaluation of the long-term risk of recurrent haemorrhoidal disease is required...|$|R

25|$|Intermittent urinary {{catheterization}} is used {{to relieve}} the bladder in people with <b>urinary</b> <b>retention.</b> Self-catheterization is an option in BPH when the bladder is difficult or impossible to completely empty. Urinary tract infection {{is the most common}} complication of intermittent catheterization. Several techniques and types of catheter are available, including sterile (single-use) and clean (multiple use) catheters, but none is superior to others in reducing the incidence of urinary tract infection based on current information.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{medications}} {{can increase}} urination difficulties by increasing bladder outlet resistance by increasing smooth muscle tone at the prostate or bladder neck {{and contribute to}} LUTS. Alpha-adrenergic agonist medications, such as decongestants with pseudoephedrine can increase bladder outlet resistance. In contrast, calcium channel blockers and anticholinergic medications can worsen <b>urinary</b> <b>retention</b> by promoting bladder muscle relaxation. Diuretic medications such as loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) or thiazides (e.g., chlorthalidone) can cause or worsen urinary frequency and nighttime awakenings to urinate.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{diagnosis}} of AKI is made, further testing is often required to determine the underlying cause. It is useful to perform a bladder scan or a post void residual to rule out <b>urinary</b> <b>retention.</b> In post void residual, a catheter is inserted into the urinary tract immediately after urinating to measure fluid still in the bladder. 50–100nbsp&ml suggests neurogenic bladder dysfunction. A kidney ultrasound will demonstrate hydronephrosis if present. A CT scan of the abdomen will also demonstrate bladder distension or hydronephrosis. However, in AKI, the use of IV contrast is contraindicated as the contrast agent used is nephrotoxic.|$|E

40|$|SummaryGlucocorticoid excess causes insulin {{resistance}} and hypertension. Hepatic expression of PPARα (Ppara) {{is required for}} glucocorticoid-induced {{insulin resistance}}. Here we demonstrate that afferent fibers of the vagus nerve interface with hepatic Ppara expression to disrupt blood pressure and glucose homeostasis in response to glucocorticoids. Selective hepatic vagotomy decreased hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hepatic insulin resistance, Ppara expression, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) enzyme activity in dexamethasone-treated Ppara+/+ mice. Selective vagotomy also decreased blood pressure, adrenergic tone, renin activity, and <b>urinary</b> sodium <b>retention</b> in these mice. Hepatic reconstitution of Ppara in nondiabetic, normotensive dexamethasone-treated PPARα null mice increased glucose, insulin, hepatic PEPCK enzyme activity, blood pressure, and renin activity in sham-operated animals but not hepatic-vagotomized animals. Disruption of vagal afferent fibers by chemical or surgical means prevented glucocorticoid-induced metabolic derangements. We conclude that a dynamic interaction between hepatic Ppara expression and a vagal afferent pathway is essential for glucocorticoid induction of diabetes and hypertension...|$|R
30|$|Embolization of {{bleeding}} due to locally advanced bladder tumors {{is one of}} the most effective and minimally invasive methods, especially in cases of non-operative bleeding that doesn‘t react to conservative treatment. Severe complications are rare, but if they occur, patient’s well-being would be at risk (Korkmaz et al., 2016; Greenstein et al., 1983). Complications can manifest as fever, pelvic pain, nausea (all of this is associated with postembolization syndrome and can be managed with NSAIDs). Minor complications can occur on first postprocedural days. It can be infection, <b>urinary</b> incontinence, <b>retention</b> of urine, prostatitis, soft tissue and penile ischemia (Greenstein et al., 1983). All of the conditions should be managed conservatively.Recently several case reports with positive outcome have been published (Vikash Prasad, 2009; Korkmaz et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2000; Pereira & Phan, 2004; Carmignani et al., 1980; El-Assmy & Mohsen, 2007).

25|$|Tolerance is {{a process}} {{characterized}} by neuroadaptations that result in reduced drug effects. While receptor upregulation may often {{play an important role}} other mechanisms are also known. Tolerance is more pronounced for some effects than for others; tolerance occurs slowly to the effects on mood, itching, <b>urinary</b> <b>retention,</b> and respiratory depression, but occurs more quickly to the analgesia and other physical side effects. However, tolerance does not develop to constipation or miosis (the constriction of the pupil of the eye to {{less than or equal to}} two millimeters). This idea has been challenged, however, with some authors arguing that tolerance does develop to miosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{adverse effects}} of {{pethidine}} administration are primarily those of the opioids as a class: nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness, diaphoresis, <b>urinary</b> <b>retention,</b> and constipation. Unlike other opioids, it does not cause miosis because of its anticholinergic properties. Overdose can cause muscle flaccidity, respiratory depression, obtundation, cold and clammy skin, hypotension, and coma. A narcotic antagonist such as naloxone is indicated to reverse respiratory depression and other effects of pethidine. Serotonin syndrome has occurred in patients receiving concurrent antidepressant therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Convulsive seizures sometimes observed in patients receiving parenteral pethidine on a chronic basis {{have been attributed to}} accumumulation in plasma of the metabolite norpethidine (normeperidine). Fatalities have occurred following either oral or intravenous pethidine overdose.|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for LUTS is broad and includes various medical conditions, neurologic disorders, {{and other diseases}} of the bladder, urethra, and prostate such as bladder cancer, urinary tract infection, urethral stricture, urethral calculi (stones), chronic prostatitis, and prostate cancer. Neurogenic bladder can cause <b>urinary</b> <b>retention</b> and cause symptoms {{similar to those of}} BPH. This may occur as a result of uncoordinated contraction of the bladder muscle or impairment in the timing of bladder muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation. Notable causes of neurogenic bladder include disorders of the central nervous system such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injuries as well as disorders of the peripheral nervous system such as diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency, and alcohol-induced nerve damage. Individuals affected by heart failure often experience nighttime awakenings to urinate due to redistribution of fluid accumulated in swollen legs.|$|E

There is, however, no consensus on management prior to removal of the indwelling catheter for short-term patients. This systematic review examined the necessity of clamping before removal of an indwelling urinary catheter in short-term patients. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using eight databases and predetermined keywords-guided searches. Some 2, 515 studies were evaluated. Ten studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected. Results: The quality of the studies was assessed using the Jadad scoring system. Only 40. 0 % of studies were rated as high quality.
