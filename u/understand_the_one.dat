60|$|I {{turned and}} beheld Fujiyama across {{a sea of}} upward-sloping fields and woods. It is about {{fourteen}} thousand feet high--not very much, according to our ideas. But fourteen thousand feet above the sea when one stands {{in the midst of}} sixteen-thousand-foot peaks, is quite another thing from the same height noted at sea-level in a comparatively flat country. The labouring eye crawls up every foot of the dead crater's smooth flank, and at the summit confesses that it has seen nothing in all the Himalayas to match the monster. I was satisfied. Fujiyama was exactly as I had seen it on fans and lacquer boxes; I would not have sold my sight of it for the crest of Kinchinjunga flushed with the morning. Fujiyama is the keynote of Japan.

In the turnpikes, the railways, the depots, and the new boulevards of uniform houses in Florence and other cities here, I see the genius of Louis Napoleon, or rather, I see the works of that statesman imitated. But Louis has taken care that in France there shall be a foundation for these improvements--money. He has always the wherewithal to back up his projects; they strengthen France and never weaken her. Her material prosperity is genuine. But here the case is different. This country is bankrupt. There is no real foundation for these great works. The prosperity they would seem to indicate is a pretence. There is no money in the treasury, and so they enfeeble her instead of strengthening. Italy has achieved the dearest wish of her heart and become an independent State--and in so doing she has drawn an elephant in the political lottery. She has nothing to feed it on. Inexperienced in government, she plunged into all manner of useless expenditure, and swamped her treasury almost in a day. She squandered millions of francs on a navy which she did not need, {{and the first time}} she took her new toy into action she got it knocked higher than Gilderoy's kite--to use the language of the Pilgrims.|$|E

60|$|I shall {{enter on}} this branch of my subject with some fear and trembling; {{not only on}} account of my own ignorance, but {{on account of the}} great {{difficulty}} of handling it without trenching on certain controversial subjects which are rightly and wisely forbidden here. For there was not one school of Metaphysic at Alexandria: there were two; which, during the whole period of their existence, were in internecine struggle with each other, and yet mutually borrowing from each other; the Heathen, namely, and the Christian. And you cannot contemplate, still less can you <b>understand,</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> without the other. Some of late years have become all but unaware of the existence of that Christian school; and the word Philosophy, on the authority of Gibbon, who, however excellent an authority for facts, knew nothing about Philosophy, and cared less, has been used exclusively to express heathen thought; a misnomer which in Alexandria would have astonished Plotinus or Hypatia as much as it would Clement or Origen. I do not say that there is, or ought to be, a Christian Metaphysic. I am speaking, as you know, merely as a historian, dealing with facts; and I say that there was one; as profound, as scientific, as severe, as that of the Pagan Neoplatonists; starting indeed, as I shall show hereafter, on many points from common ground with theirs. One can hardly doubt, I should fancy, that many parts of St. John's Gospel and Epistles, whatever view we may take of them, {{if they are to be}} called anything, are to be called metaphysic and philosophic. And one can no more doubt that before writing them he had studied Philo, and was expanding Philo's thought in the direction which seemed fit to him, than we can doubt it of the earlier Neoplatonists. The technical language is often identical; so are the primary ideas from which he starts, howsoever widely the conclusions may differ. If Plotinus considered himself an intellectual disciple of Plato, so did Origen and Clemens. And I must, as I said before, speak of both, or of neither. My only hope of escaping delicate ground lies in the curious fact, that rightly or wrongly, the form in which Christianity presented itself to the old Alexandrian thinkers was so utterly different from the popular conception of it in modern England, that one may very likely be able to tell what little one knows about it, almost without mentioning a single doctrine which now influences the religious world.|$|E
6000|$|... 137. Now {{you will}} be able to understand, among other matters, wherein {{consists}} the excellence, and wherein the shortcoming, of the tree-drawing of Harding. It is excellent in so far as it fondly observes, with more truth than any other work of the kind, the great laws of growth and action in trees: it fails,--and observe, not in a minor, but in the principal point,--because it cannot rightly render any one individual detail or incident of foliage. And in this it fails, not from mere carelessness or incompletion, but of necessity; the true drawing of detail being for evermore impossible to a hand which has contracted a habit of execution. The noble draughtsman draws a leaf, and stops, and says calmly,--That leaf is of such and such a character; I will give him a friend who will entirely suit him: then he considers what his friend ought to be, and having determined, he draws his friend. This process may be as quick as lightning when the master is great--one of the sons of the giants; or it may be slow and timid: but the process is always gone through; no touch or form is ever added to another by a good painter without a mental determination and affirmation. But when the hand has got into a habit, leaf No. 1 necessitates leaf No. 2; you cannot stop, your hand is as a horse with the bit in its teeth; or rather is, for the time, a machine, throwing out leaves to order and pattern, all alike. You must stop that hand of yours, however painfully; make it understand that it is not to have its own way any more, that it shall never more slip from one touch to another without orders; otherwise it is not you who are the master, but your fingers. You may therefore study Harding's drawing, and take pleasure in it;[33] and you may properly admire the dexterity which applies the habit of the hand so well, and produces results on the whole so satisfactory: but you must never copy it; otherwise your progress will be at once arrested. The utmost you can ever hope to do would be a sketch in Harding's manner, but of far inferior dexterity; for he has given his life's toil to gain his dexterity, and you, I suppose, have other things to work at besides drawing. You would also incapacitate yourself from ever understanding what truly great work was, or what Nature was; but, by the earnest and complete study of facts, you will gradually come to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> and love the other more and more, whether you can draw well yourself or not.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the general}} {{principles}} underlying genetic regulation in eukaryotes is an incomplete and challenging endeavor. The lack of experimental {{information regarding the}} regulation of the whole set of transcription factors and their targets in different cell types {{is one of the}} main reasons to this incompleteness. So far, there is a small set of curated known interactions between transcription factors and their downstream genes. Here, we built a transcription factor network for human monocytic THP- 1 myeloid cells based on the experimentally curated FANTOM 4 database where nodes are genes and the experimental interactions correspond to links. We present the topological parameters which define the network as well as some global structural features and introduce a relative inuence parameter to quantify the relevance of a transcription factor in the context of induction of a phenotype. Genes like ZHX 2, ADNP, or SMAD 6 seem to be highly regulated to avoid an avalanche transcription event. We compare these results with those of RegulonDB, a highly curated transcriptional network for the prokaryotic organism E. coli, finding similarities between general hallmarks on both transcriptional programs. We believe that an approach, such as the one shown here, could help to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> regulation of transcription in eukaryotic cells...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 61 - 64. Self-assembled nanowire {{growth on}} semiconductor surface {{is based on}} deposing sub-monolayer material over the surface. Even though high resolution STM image gives plausible surface analysis, determination of the nanowire structure is the most di↵ucult part of these experiments. Due to the this reason, first-principles investigation is essential to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> dimensional nanowire structure grown over the surface {{as well as the}} STM images of these structures. Recently, iridium silicide nanowire on Si (001) surface is observed. In this thesis, we study formation of the nanowire after deposition of Ir on Si(001). Ab-initio plane wave pseudopotential calculations are performed for number of iridium silicide nanowires generated by increasing iridium coverage on Si(001) surface. For the iridium coverage as 0. 125 ML, the possible nanowire formation is analyzed and its calculated STM images are compared with experimental STM image. As a result of our detailed analysis, we suggest that the STM image observed at experiment doesn’t consist of Ir atoms since Ir atom tends to be buried into the Si bulk. We model the possible nanowire formation which is consistent with pseudo-STM calculation. According to our model, iridium is placed at the troughs between the dimer rows on the surface and it creates a structure by breaking the Si dimer bonds. The coverage implied by the model, is consistent with experimental numbers. Oğuz, İsmail CanM. S...|$|E

40|$|The speedup over a {{microprocessor}} {{that can be}} achieved by implementing some programs on an FPGA has been extensively reported. This paper presents an analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, at the architecture level of the components of this speedup. Obviously, the spatial parallelism that can be exploited on the FPGA is a big component. By itself, however, it does not account for the whole speedup. In this paper we experimentally analyze the remaining components of the speedup. We compare the performance of image processing application programs executing in hardware on a Xilinx Virtex E 2000 FPGA to that on three general-purpose processor platforms: MIPS, Pentium III and VLIW. The question we set out to answer is what is the inherent advantage of a hardware implementation over a von Neumann platform. On the one hand, the clock frequency of general-purpose processors is about 20 times that of typical FPGA implementations. On the other hand, the iteration level parallelism on the FPGA is one to two orders of magnitude that on the CPUs. In addition to these two factors, we identify the efficiency advantage of FPGAs as an important factor and show that it ranges from 6 to 47 on our test benchmarks. We also identify some of the components of this factor: the streaming of data from memory, the overlap of control and data flow and the elimination of some instruction on the FPGA. The results provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} tradeoff between system complexity and performance when designing Configurable SoC as well as designing software for CSoC. They also help <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> to two orders of magnitude in speedup of FPGAs over CPU after accounting for clock frequencies...|$|E
40|$|A pesquisa busca verificar a relaÃÃo entre a aÃÃo efetiva dos Conselhos Gestores, como espaÃos de participaÃÃo democrÃtica, e as questÃes da vinculaÃÃo e da prioridade por meio do Conselho Municipal dos Direitos das CrianÃas e dos Adolescentes, da Cidade de Toledo/PR, com base nas gestÃes 2007 / 2009 e 2009 / 2011. Por aÃÃo efetiva entendemos aquela que contempla a participaÃÃo da sociedade civil nos debates, na proposiÃÃo e na elaboraÃÃo de decisÃes sobre polÃticas pÃblicas municipais na Ãrea da crianÃa e do adolescente e que busca os meios de fazer valer o teor do decidido junto ao Poder PÃblico Municipal. De um lado, a vinculaÃÃo, por mandamento constitucional e legal, determina a inclusÃo, nos orÃamentos pÃblicos, das polÃticas pÃblicas deliberadas nos Ãmbitos dos Conselhos. Por outro lado, tambÃm hÃ previsÃo de atendimento prioritÃrio Ãs demandas da populaÃÃo infantojuvenil, que deve ser realizado pelas aÃÃes do Conselho, o que reflete na impositividade das deliberaÃÃes. Entretanto, a realidade dos Conselhos tem demonstrado que o Poder PÃblico nÃo tem convertido as deliberaÃÃes em polÃticas pÃblicas municipais, as quais, na seara da InfÃncia e da Juventude, tÃm de ser prioritÃrias. Com base na anÃlise das atas, no decorrer das duas gestÃes, corroboramos a explicaÃÃo, formulada como hipÃtese inicial de trabalho, a este descompasso, lastreada no comportamento do prÃprio Conselho: quanto mais efetiva for a aÃÃo do Conselho, mais o Poder PÃblico acatarÃ suas deliberaÃÃes, incluindo-as no orÃamento e transformando-as em polÃticas pÃblicas.

By effective action, we <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> which includes the participation of civil society in the debates, proposals and preparation of decisions about public policies in the municipal area of child and adolescent and seeks the means to enforce the substance of the decision by the municipal government. On the one hand, the binding, by legal and constitutional commandment, determines the inclusion, in public budgets, of the deliberated public policies by the Councils. On the other hand, there is also the prediction of priority attendance of the infantojuvenil demands, which must be accomplished by the actions of the Council, and reflects in the imposing of the deliberations. However, the reality of the Councils has shown that the Government has not converted the decisions in municipal public policies, which, in the area of Children and Youth, must be priority. Based on the analysis of the records in the course of two terms, we corroborate the explanation, formulated as initial working hypothesis, backed the Council's own behavior: the more effective is the Council's action, the more the Government will comply with their deliberations, including them in the budget and turning them into public policy...|$|E
