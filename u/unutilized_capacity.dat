A third, {{more recent}} {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} reproduction process (both the material reproduction processes and the reproduction of capital) has become completely dominated by capital finance. Hence, to explain economic crises, critical disproportions between the developments of branches of production, or <b>unutilized</b> <b>capacity</b> ought {{to be viewed as}} emerging out of specific financial and monetary regimes pursued by financial institutions and the state. The large funds commanded by these organizations are thought to shape the whole character of the reproduction process. As analysts like Michael Hudson like to point out, ordinary consumers in developed countries today have little in common anymore with how economists portray them in their models, because in reality consumers are using the majority of what they earn to pay interest, premiums, rent and debt principal to the financial industry (finance, insurance and real estate). Consumers spend less than a quarter or less than 20% of their earnings on actual goods and services. Just as Marx noted a progression from natural economy to a [...] "money-economy" [...] and then a [...] "credit economy", it is argued that the reproduction process has now become dominated by the supply, demand, or withdrawal of credit-money. However, there is much theoretical controversy about exactly how the relationship between the [...] "real economy" [...] (the direct involvement with the production and consumption of goods and services) and the [...] "financial economy" [...] (the circuit of trade in financial claims) should be understood. There is not much consensus about the effects of different financial policies by government and business on the economy, or how one could prove what the effects are.|$|E

Therefore, we employ the PPA process in order to sequentially transfer <b>unutilized</b> <b>capacity</b> from the k – 1 primary VPs to the CE partition and vice versa.

40|$|From the {{perspective}} of evolutionary biology, the functional capacity of an organ should match the demands imposed upon it. Functional capacities {{in excess of the}} actual demands cost energy through maintenance of underutilized organ size and function. Insufficient capacity restricts the ability to exploit the full extent of resources, even if resources are available in unlimited supply. This hypothesis rests on two major assumptions. First, the energy budget of an individual is limited, and the maintenance of <b>unutilized</b> <b>capacities</b> costs a measurable/significant portion of its biosynthetic energy budget. Second, mismatching reduces fitness relative to individuals with optimized organ design, because of energetic costs. Therefore, individuals ought to respond to changes in the actual demands by adjusting their functional capacities (Diamond and Hammond, 1992; Diamond, 1998; Hammond, 1998; Weibel...|$|R

Inflation equations are then estimated for consumer and wholesale prices using pooled data referring to 80 episodes of devaluations/depreciations for seven industrial countries during the period 1966 - 93. The tests show that the macroeconomic policy followed by the country significantly influences the degree of pass-through and that the 1992 - 93 episodes do not constitute a break with respect to previous devaluation episodes when inflation accelerated sharply. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] The {{focus of}} this paper is one slow-burning change in the {{organization}} of capitalism in Europe, marketization (Greer and Doellgast 2013, Hauptmeier 2011). We argue that a specific species of marketization, management whipsawing, is causing social dumping in the automotive sector. By management whipsawing we mean the staging of economic competition by large corporations with several production units in a way that extracts labor concessions by pitting local workers against each other in contests for investment and production. Multinational companies (MNC) were the first movers and developed various management whipsawing practices; however, the term was also used historically to describe union whipsawing at large national corporations with several production units (Ross 1948). Management whipsawing presupposes the ability to move production from one location to another, due to (for example) the standardization of production techniques, production of similar products in parallel at different locations, and <b>unutilized</b> production <b>capacity...</b>|$|R

Multi-product restricted translog profit functions and cost functions are empirically tested against 1980 household survey data. The focus {{is given to the}} majority of farmers growing rice and corn;Profit function models turn out to be less appropriate, which persistently give negative supply elasticities for rice output. Several plausable reasons include, among others, (i) the existence of non-decreasing returns to scale of the underlying technology, (ii) the dominance of regulated rice and fertilizer markets, and (iii) the prevalence of objectives other than economic profit among the farm households. In addition, the use of implicit price data inherently commit some conceptual weaknesses and measurement errors;The cost function, which embodies weaker assumptions than the profit function, produces plausible results. Several hypothesis tests reveal (i) the rejection of homotheticity, and which also preclude the use of more restrictive models of homothetic and homogeneous functions, including Cobb-Douglas forms, (ii) the existence of output jointness for rice and corn, lending no legitimate support for single-product model for the multi-crop farms, and (iii) some supports for the homothetically separable rice and corn outputs, indicating the validity of an aggregate output model;The econometric estimation for the multi-product non-homothetic translog cost function indicates that (i) the farmers are significantly responsive to input price changes, though quantitatively modest and inelastic, (ii) the major inputs of fertilizer, hired labor, bullock and seed are net substitutes (except seed and bullock), and (iii) there exists some <b>unutilized</b> production <b>capacity,</b> implying that outputs can still be expanded using less than proportional variable costs;Several directions for model improvement and empirical estimation are suggested...|$|R
30|$|While {{potentially}} degrading the CRN goodput, {{the use of}} low power/rate transmission {{reduces the}} probability of intercepting ongoing unidentified PRN transmissions since the lower the rate, the lower its power. Starting from the minimum values, a SU-TX increases the rate and power used with probability (1 - p) to the next higher values upon a successful transmission until either the second highest values are reached or a transmission failure occurs. The purpose of the former condition is to not sacrifice the goodput of the CRN if there does not exist any nearby SU transmissions by gradually shrinking the <b>unutilized</b> <b>capacity</b> margin. Meanwhile, if a nearby secondary transmission decides to explore the same spectrum, it will cause the high rate transmission to fail. In this case, our scheme will have a SU-TX reverting to the lowest power/rate for future transmissions. Low power/rate communication scheme is more robust to interference that cannot be explicitly nulled out [20]. It was shown that multiple low power and low rate transmissions successfully coexist without explicit interference suppression [21].|$|E

Third, the model is transformed into a dynamic systems model based on the logistic growth equation. This model describes cognitive growth as a system of supportive and competitive interactions between growers. Models of normal logistic growth, U-shaped growth, bootstrap growth, and competitive growth are also presented.

Thus, operators currently facing a high traffic load could make use of additional resources, while other providers having temporal and local low traffic levels have unused resources that they could offer to the other operators.

Capacity planning for health manpower supply is a strategic issue with increasing complexity and importance.

The simulation model provides an experimental tool, which can be used to evaluate alternative long-term policies based on demand-supply planning reliability as a performance measure. Validation and numerical experimentations further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, providing sound managerial insights.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of credit in shaping {{economic}} recoveries and tries to {{shed some light on}} the phenomenon of creditless recoveries using industry-level data for a large sample of countries. We find that while a failure of the credit stock to recover to its pre-crisis level does not hamper growth, a failure of credit flows to recover slows down economic recovery. Next, we find that industries that are more dependent on external finance recover more quickly in countries with better financial development during creditless recoveries as defined by Calvo et al. (2006 a). This indicates that certain mechanisms enable the economy to grow despite the creditless character of recovery. These mechanisms may include the availability of alternative sources of financing such as trade credit, the re-allocation to less credit dependent sectors, or the take-up of <b>unutilized</b> <b>capacity.</b> Finally, we find evidence that industries that are more dependent on trade credit as opposed to bank credit recover more quickly because they are less vulnerable to prolonged credit market disruptions. This 'substitution effect' is stronger during creditless recoveries, giving support to the view that creditless recoveries are a response to protracted disruptions in official credit markets. creditless recoveries; financial crises; trade credit...|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to highlight the great untapped potential contribution to economic growth through R&D by departments at universities. Literature review on R&D was undertaken and used as a basis for introducing summary of examples of research case studies that have been done. There is need for organizations to be innovative, to research and to develop new products, processes and systems. What worked for us 20 years ago will not work for us today and in the future. ?Products are born; they live, and they die?. The challenge is to have products that are always alive and fetching money for the organization besides negative influence by factors such as economical, sociological, technological and political changes. This paper outlines an opportunity for breaking away from the traditional way of doing things through fully utilizing the potential that lies within institutions of higher learning. It highlights one such involvement by the Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering at the National University of Science and Technology (NUST) in Zimbabwe through students, lecturers and research staff. Organizations lack the ingredients for catching up with the pace of technology advancement because they do not have dedicated resources for R&D.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} demand modeling and capacity planning for innovative short life-cycle products. We first {{developed a new}} model {{in the class of}} stochastic Bass formulations that addresses the shortcomings of models from the extant literature. The proposed model considers the common fact that the market potential of a product is not fixed and might change during a life-cycle due to exogenous (e. g., economic- or competitors-related) or endogenous (e. g., quality-related) factors. Allowing this parameter (market potential in the Bass model) to follow a geometric random walk, we have showed that the future demand of a product in each period follows a lognormal distribution with specific mean and variance. We also developed a novel stochastic capacity expansion model that can be used by a make-to-order manufacturer, who faces stochastic stationary/non-stationary demand, in order to optimally determine policies for specifying the sizes of capacity procurement. In addition to the cost of expansion decisions, the proposed risk-neutral expansion model considers procurement lead-times, irreversibility of investments, and the costs associated with lost sales and <b>unutilized</b> <b>capacity.</b> We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the derived optimal policy. We then present an exact solution method, which is more efficient than classical recursive methods. Additionally, three extensions of the proposed expansion model that can address more complicated settings are presented. The first extension increases the capability of the model in order to tackle capacity planning for a multi-sourcing scenario. Multi-sourcing is a case in which the manufacturer can procure capacity from two supply modes whose marginal expansion costs and lead-times are complementary. The second extension addresses a scenario in which an installed capacity can be used for producing future generations of a product. The last extension accounts for salvage value of the installed capacity in the model and provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal policy. Finally, using the proposed stochastic Bass model, we present the results and managerial insights gathered from numerical experiments that have been conducted for the stochastic capacity expansion models...|$|E
40|$|There are no {{containers}} transported with maritime transportation within Sweden today. Despite <b>unutilized</b> <b>capacity</b> at sea {{along the}} Swedish coastline, all domestic container transportation {{to and from}} Swedish ports are made by road or rail transport. The inland transport infrastructure is heavily utilized and unless finding new transport solutions, the increasing volumes of transported cargo will require investments in new infrastructure. The use of coastal shipping could contribute to reduced utilization of roads and railways. It is therefore of interest to investigate the possibilities of using coastal shipping {{as an alternative to}} land-based container transport in Sweden. One route where coastal shipping could be a possible alternative is between Port of Uddevalla and Port of Gothenburg. The {{purpose of this study is}} therefore to evaluate if and how coastal shipping of containers between Port of Uddevalla and Port of Gothenburg can be a competitive alternative to rail and road transportation. The case studied in this report is a theoretical case since no containers are transported by coastal shipping on the route today. To evaluate the competitiveness of this theoretical case, findings from previous research regarding coastal shipping have been reviewed and interviews with actors involved in the case have been conducted. The economic, logistic and environmental performance of the theoretical case has been calculated and qualitatively analysed. The results show that there are certain requirements regarding total cost, reliability, frequency, volume flexibility and environmental impact that must be met in order to establish a competitive coastal shipping solution between Port of Uddevalla and Port of Gothenburg. With the prerequisites of today, the requirements regarding total cost and environmental impact cannot be met. To make the coastal shipping solution competitive, costs of loading and unloading containers in the ports must be reduced and fuel-efficient vessels with gas cleaning systems must be used. The study resulted in three theoretical frameworks regarding the economic, logistic and environmental performance of coastal shipping. These frameworks are possible to apply on other cases as well and they are therefore part of this study’s contribution to theory. Furthermore, a list of requirements for a competitive coastal shipping solution was developed, as well as an economic performance calculation model. These theoretical contributions are also possible to apply on other, similar cases. One practical implication of the study is that transport operators should negotiate with ports to reduce the price charged for the loading and unloading of containers. These negotiations should give the ports incentives to investigate the possibilities to reduce costs in ports and change the price structures for coastal shipping. Another practical implication is that transport operators must evaluate the options for more environmentally friendly vessels that can be used on the route...|$|E
