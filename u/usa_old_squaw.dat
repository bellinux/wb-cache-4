60|$|An <b>old</b> <b>squaw,</b> peeling a willow pole in the {{sunshine}} of an open doorway, raised her head and uttered a shrill cry.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{see how it}} is! She's {{already the}} millionairess. Who ever heard of an Injun getting up a horse for an <b>old</b> <b>squaw?</b> Look at Eugene!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{afternoon}} {{passed without}} further incident until the <b>old</b> <b>squaw</b> entered, manifestly to feed Allie, and tie her up as heretofore. The younger squaw {{came in to}} watch the latter process.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Old</b> <b>Squaw</b> was {{reportedly}} {{so named because}} “the old women of Indian tribes once living in Kansas found relief from their intense dyspepsia caused by their heavy meat diet and little or no exercise.” ...|$|R
50|$|Part of the Baffin Island {{offshore}} islands {{located in}} Wayne Bay, west of Becher Peninsula, the <b>Old</b> <b>Squaw</b> Islands {{are part of}} the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and the Qikiqtaaluk Region, in the Canadian territory of Nunavut.|$|R
60|$|The maidens {{had long}} since desisted {{in their efforts to}} torment the prisoner. Even the {{hardened}} <b>old</b> <b>squaws</b> had withdrawn. The prisoner's proud, handsome face, his upright bearing, his scorn for his enemies, his indifference to the cuts and bruises, and red welts upon his clear white skin had won their hearts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't," [...] I said in alarm. [...] "They're such a villainous-looking lot--so dirty--and they've got {{so little}} {{clothing}} on. I wouldn't sleep a wink near them. Look at that awful <b>old</b> <b>squaw</b> {{with only one}} eye. They'd steal everything we've got left, Kate. Remember the ham--oh, pray remember the fate of our beautiful ham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{not be in}} haste {{like women}} and children," [...] he said; [...] "if we leave him bound to the tree all night he will {{have time to think}} of the fate that is coming, and we shall have good {{sunlight}} in the morning, which will enable even the <b>oldest</b> <b>squaw</b> to see well." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the steep}} places, where the <b>old</b> <b>squaw</b> {{was forced to}} cling to her saddle, groaning with pain, the kindly Wetherell walked beside her, easing her down the banks. In {{crossing}} the streams he helped her find the shallowest fording, and in other ways was singularly considerate. Kelley couldn't have done this, but he saw the value of it.|$|R
60|$|The hunter, {{led down}} the lane toward the {{approaching}} crowd, presented a calm and fearless demeanor. When the Indians surrounded him one prolonged, furious yell rent the air, and then followed an extraordinary demonstration of fierce delight. The young brave's staccato yell, the maiden's scream, the <b>old</b> <b>squaw's</b> screech, and the deep war-cry of the warriors intermingled in a fearful discordance.|$|R
6000|$|Well, {{that was}} the worst of it, and perhaps it was not so much, after all, to any but herself. For when she {{recovered}} her senses it was bright sunlight and dead low water. There was a confused noise of guttural voices about her, and an <b>old</b> <b>squaw,</b> singing an Indian [...] "hushaby," [...] and rocking herself from side to side before a fire built on the marsh, before which she, the recovered wife and mother, lay weak and weary. Her first thought was for her baby, and she was about to speak when a young squaw, who must have been a mother herself, fathomed her thought and brought her the [...] "mowitch," [...] pale but living, in such a queer little willow cradle, all bound up, just like the squaw's own young one, that she laughed and cried together, and the young <b>squaw</b> and the <b>old</b> <b>squaw</b> showed their big white teeth and glinted their black eyes, and said, [...] "Plenty get well, skeena mowitch," [...] "Wagee man come plenty soon," [...] and she could have kissed their brown faces in her joy. And then she found that they had been gathering berries on the marsh in heir queer comical baskets, and saw the skirt of her gown fluttering on the tree from afar, and the <b>old</b> <b>squaw</b> couldn't resist the temptation of procuring a new garment, and came down and discovered the [...] "wagee" [...] woman and child. And of course she gave the garment to the <b>old</b> <b>squaw,</b> as you may imagine, and when he came at last and rushed up to her, looking about ten years older in his anxiety, she felt so faint again that they had to carry her to the canoe. For, you see, he knew nothing about the flood until he met the Indians at Utopia, and knew by the signs that the poor woman was his wife. And at the next high tide he towed the tree away back home, although it wasn't worth the trouble, and built another house, using the old tree for the foundation and props, and called it after her, [...] "Mary's Ark!" [...] But you may guess the next house was built above high- water mark. And that's all.|$|R

60|$|But he said nothing, {{brushing}} {{his way through}} the clamorous mass and directing his staggering steps toward Tyee. The <b>old</b> <b>squaw</b> raised the wail, and one by one the women joined her as they swung in behind. The men crawled out of their trenches and ran back to gather about Tyee, and it was noticed that the Sunlanders climbed upon their barricade to see.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure it will}} {{be as good as}} a {{perpetual}} picnic. George Kearney says we can have a cooking-stove under the tree outside at the back, and as there will be no rain for three months we can do the cooking there, and that will give us more room for--for the piano when it comes; and there's an <b>old</b> <b>squaw</b> to do the cleaning and washing-up any day--and--and--it will be real fun." ...|$|R
60|$|They landed {{amidst a}} rabble crowd, and were {{received}} {{on the bank}} by the left-handed chief, who conducted them into the village with grave courtesy; driving {{to the right and}} left the swarms of <b>old</b> <b>squaws,</b> imp-like boys, and vagabond dogs, with which the place abounded. They wound their way between the cabins, which looked like dirt-heaps huddled together without any plan, and surrounded by old palisades; all filthy in the extreme, and redolent of villainous smells.|$|R
50|$|Several of {{the springs}} {{in the area}} were {{analysed}} for their mineral content, and the results indicated benefits that would attract visitors. The Bonner Springs Improvement Club, in 1907, created a promotional brochure touting the city as the “Kansas Karlsbad” and listing the contents of five springs near Lake of the Woods: Big Chief, Little Chief, Papoose, <b>Old</b> <b>Squaw</b> and Minnehaha. They listed “grains per gallon” of things like potassium sulphate, carbonate of iron, and chloride of sodium for each.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{it turns}} out that that {{wonderful}} chief, that them two packers used to rave about, woz about as big a devil ez any, and tried to run off with the agent's wife, only the warriors killed her. I'd like to know what become of him. Some says he was killed, others allow that he got away. I've heerd tell that he was originally some kind of Methodist preacher!--a kind o' saint that got a sort o' spiritooal holt on the <b>old</b> <b>squaws</b> and children." ...|$|R
60|$|All was ready, and one moonless {{night the}} signal was given. A cricket chirped shrilly outside the tent where the {{children}} slept with one <b>old</b> <b>squaw.</b> A strong hand cut the skin beside their bed of fir-boughs, and two trembling creatures crept out to follow the tall shadow that flitted noiselessly before them {{into the darkness of}} the wood. Not a broken twig, a careless step, or a whispered word betrayed them, and they vanished as swiftly and silently as hunted deer flying for their lives.|$|R
60|$|She {{was led to}} a big lodge with a tent adjoining. Inside an old Indian brave, grizzled and shrunken, smoked {{before a}} fire; and as Allie was pushed into the tent a young Indian squaw appeared. She was small, with handsome, scornful face and dark, proud eyes, gorgeously clad in {{elaborate}} beaded and fringed buckskin--evidently an Indian princess or a chief's wife. She threw Allie a venomous glance as she went out. Allie heard the <b>old</b> <b>squaw's</b> grunting voice, and the young one's quick and passionate answers.|$|R
60|$|When he {{had been}} tied with wet {{buckskin}} thongs to the post {{in the center of}} the oval, the youths, the younger braves, and the squaws began circling round him, yelling like so many demons. The <b>old</b> <b>squaws</b> thrust sharpened sticks, which had been soaked in salt water, into his flesh. The maidens struck him with willows which left red welts on his white shoulders. The braves buried the blades of their tomahawks in the post as near as possible to his head without actually hitting him.|$|R
60|$|To a {{dog with}} a good {{appetite}} which had been on short allowance for several days, the mouthful {{given to him by}} the <b>old</b> <b>squaw</b> was a mere nothing. All that day he kept bounding over the plain from bluff to bluff in search of something to eat, but found nothing until dusk, when he pounced suddenly and most unexpectedly on a prairie-hen fast asleep. In one moment its life was gone. In less than a minute its body was gone too--feathers and bones and all--down Crusoe's ravenous throat.|$|R

6000|$|Having now, as he thought, {{balanced}} {{this little}} account of friendship, {{the captain was}} about to shift his saddle to this noble gift-horse when the affectionate patriarch plucked him by the sleeve, and introduced to him a whimpering, whining, leathern-skinned <b>old</b> <b>squaw,</b> that might have passed for an Egyptian mummy, without drying. [...] "This," [...] said he, [...] "is my wife; she is a good wife--I love her very much.--She loves the horse--she loves him a great deal--she will cry very much at losing him.--I {{do not know how}} I shall comfort her--and that makes my heart very sore." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} Crusoe had kept {{as close as}} {{possible}} to his master's side, feeling extremely uncomfortable in the midst of such a strange crowd, the more especially that the ill-looking Indian curs gave him expressive looks of hatred, and exhibited some desire to rush upon him in a body, so that he had to keep a sharp look out all round him. When, therefore, Dick entered the tent Crusoe endeavoured to do so along with him, but he was met by a blow on the nose from an <b>old</b> <b>squaw,</b> who scolded him in a shrill voice and bade him begone.|$|R
60|$|Night came. Allie {{lay awake}} a good while, {{and then she}} fell asleep. Next morning she was awakened by an uproar. Whistling and {{trampling}} mustangs, whoops of braves, the babel of many voices, barking of dogs, movement, bustle, sound--all attested to {{the return of the}} warriors. Allie's heart sank for a moment; this would be the time of trial for her. But the clamor subsided without any disturbance near her tent. By and by the <b>old</b> <b>squaw</b> returned to attend to her needs. This time on the way out she dropped a blanket curtain between the tent and the lodge.|$|R
6000|$|... "To cook by your {{fire and}} to sleep under your roof for the night," [...] I had {{announced}} on entering old Ebbits's cabin; {{and he had}} looked at me blear- eyed and vacuous, while Zilla had favored me with a sour face and a contemptuous grunt. Zilla was his wife, and no more bitter-tongued, implacable <b>old</b> <b>squaw</b> dwelt on the Yukon. Nor would I have stopped there had my dogs been less tired or had {{the rest of the}} village been inhabited. But this cabin alone had I found occupied, and in this cabin, perforce, I took my shelter.|$|R

2500|$|S.P. Yeomans, {{editor of}} the Sioux City Register, circa May 30, 1863, wrote of the {{aftermath}} of this terror, as defeated survivors were shipped to their new homes. “The formerly favorite steamer, Florence,” he wrote, “arrived at our levee on Tuesday; but instead of the cheerful faces of Capt. Throckmorten and Clerk Gorman we saw those of strangers; and instead of her usual lading of merchandise for our merchants, she was crowded from stem to stern, and from hold to hurricane deck with <b>old</b> <b>squaws</b> and papooses — about 1,400 in all — the non combative remnants of the Santee Sioux of Minnesota, en route to their new home….” ...|$|R

We have an <b>old</b> <b>squaw</b> when mother is home, but she don't like me, and so she takes a {{vacation}} whenever the old lady does. That throws us down on Hosy, and he just about poisons us. A Mexican can't cook no more'n an Injun. We get spring-poor {{by the time the}} old lady comes back." [...] Jennie was rolling at the dough and did not reply to him. He held the door open for her when she was ready to put the biscuit in the oven, and lit another bracket-lamp in order to see her better.|$|R
60|$|As Isaac was {{led down}} a lane between two {{long lines of}} tepees the {{watching}} Indians {{did not make the}} demonstration that usually marked the capture of a paleface. Some of the <b>old</b> <b>squaws</b> looked up from their work round the campfires and steaming kettles and grinned as the prisoner passed. The braves who were sitting upon their blankets and smoking their long pipes, or lounging before the warm blazes maintained a stolid indifference; the dusky maidens smiled shyly, and the little Indian boys, with whom Isaac had always been a great favorite, manifested their joy by yelling and running after him. One youngster grasped Isaac round the leg and held on until he was pulled away.|$|R
60|$|What {{could the}} worthy captain do, to console the tender-hearted <b>old</b> <b>squaw,</b> and, peradventure, {{to save the}} venerable patriarch from a curtain lecture? He bethought himself {{of a pair of}} ear-bobs: it was true, the patriarch's better-half was of an age and {{appearance}} that seemed to put personal vanity out of the question, but when is personal vanity extinct? The moment he produced the glittering earbobs, the whimpering and whining of the sempiternal beldame was at an end. She eagerly placed the precious baubles in her ears, and, though as ugly as the Witch of Endor, went off with a sideling gait and coquettish air, as though she had been a perfect Semiramis.|$|R
60|$|In the foreground, {{against the}} bank of a lazy eddy, birch-bark canoes were lined two and three deep. Ivory-bladed spears, bone-barbed arrows, buckskin-thonged bows, and simple basket-woven traps bespoke {{the fact that in}} the muddy current of the river the salmon-run was on. In the background, from the tangle of skin tents and drying frames, rose the voices of the fisher folk. Bucks skylarked with bucks or flirted with the maidens, while the <b>older</b> <b>squaws,</b> shut out from this by virtue of having {{fulfilled}} the end of their existence in reproduction, gossiped as they braided rope from the green roots of trailing vines. At their feet their naked progeny played and squabbled, or rolled in the muck with the tawny wolf-dogs.|$|R
