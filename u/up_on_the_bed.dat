25|$|Christopher's father, Ed, {{discovers the}} book and confiscates it after a brief fight with the boy. While searching for the confiscated book, Christopher uncovers a trove of letters which his mother wrote to him, dated after her {{supposed}} death, which his father has also hidden. He is so shocked by his father lying about his mother's death that {{he is unable to}} move, curls <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> vomits and groans for several hours until his father returns home. Ed realizes that Christopher has read the letters and cleans him up. He then confesses that he had indeed lied about Judy's death and also that it was he who killed Wellington, stating that it was a mistake resulting from his anger after a heated argument with Mrs Shears. Christopher, having lost all trust in his father and fearing that Ed might try to kill him since he had already killed the dog, decides to live with his mother and runs away. He remembers his mother's address from the letters and embarks on an adventurous trip to London, where his mother lives with Mr Shears.|$|E
25|$|Nowell {{was married}} to Troy Dendekker on May 18, 1996. Seven days later, {{on the morning of}} May 25, Sublime was {{supposed}} to begin a five-day tour through Northern California, followed by a European and East Coast tour. However, while the band was staying at the Ocean View Motel in San Francisco, drummer Bud Gaugh woke up to find Nowell lying {{on the floor next to}} his bed. His dalmatian, Lou Dog, was curled <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> whimpering. Bradley had tried waking up his fellow band-mates to go to the beach with him that morning, but they were too hung-over and tired to get out of bed. Initially, Gaugh assumed Nowell was too intoxicated to get into bed; however, he noticed a green film around his mouth, and it became apparent he had overdosed on heroin. Gaugh called for paramedics, but Nowell had died several hours earlier, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Nowell was cremated and his ashes were spread over his favorite surfing spot in Surfside, California. A headstone was placed at Westminster Memorial in Westminster, California in his memory.|$|E
2500|$|In the film's denouement, {{we realize}} that the real {{kidnapper}} was Jack's new wife, Amaya, {{with the help of}} her cousin, the Sheriff in Del Rio (who throughout the film appeared as if he was trying to help Jack and that he believed Jack's innocence). [...] We learn that the flashback we have seen throughout the film—of Jack/Roberto strangling a man at Katie's behest as she looks on in delight—has new meaning. [...] The man Roberto strangled was Amaya's father. [...] Worse still, Amaya was in the room with Roberto and Katie when they strangled her father, hiding under the bed. [...] Amaya's father was a degenerate gambler who owed a large debt to Katie and the Mexican Mob, and when he could not pay, Katie had Roberto kill him. [...] Amaya witnessed all of this. [...] We realize that she then set in motion an elaborate plan to emigrate to the United States and marry Jack/Roberto in order to punish him for murdering her father. [...] It was Amaya and the Sheriff who kidnapped Toby. [...] Amaya and the Sheriff set fire to the room where Jack is (the same room where he killed Amaya's father many years ago). [...] But Jack is able to see that Toby is tied <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> in the room. [...] He manages to free her and they escape the fire unhurt.|$|E
60|$|That was {{the work}} of devils, to scatter his {{thoughts}} and over-cloud his conscience, assailing him at the gates of the cowardly and sin-corrupted flesh: and, praying God timidly to forgive him his weakness, he crawled <b>up</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and, wrapping <b>the</b> blankets closely about him, covered his face again with his hands. He had sinned. He had sinned so deeply against heaven and before God that he was not worthy to be called God's child.|$|R

2500|$|Ryan P. Doom {{explains}} how the violence devolves {{as the film}} progresses. [...] "The savagery of American violence," [...] he says, [...] "begins with Chigurh's introduction: a quick one-two punch of strangulation and a bloody cattle gun. The strangulation in particular demonstrates {{the level of the}} Coens' capability to create realistic carnage-to allow the audience to understand the horror that violence delivers.....Chigurh kills a total of 12 (possibly more) people, and, curiously enough, the violence devolves as the film progresses. During {{the first half of the}} film, the Coens never shy from unleashing Chigurh ... The devolution of violence starts with Chigurh's shootout with Moss in the motel. Aside from the truck owner who is shot in the head after Moss flags him down, both the motel clerk and Wells's death occur offscreen. Wells's death in particular demonstrates that murder means nothing. Calm beyond comfort, the camera pans away when Chigurh shoots Wells with a silenced shotgun as the phone rings. He answers. It is Moss, and while they talk, blood oozes across the room toward Chigurh's feet. Not moving, he places his feet <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and continues the conversation as the blood continues to spread across the floor. By the time he keeps his promise of visiting Carla Jean, the resolution and the violence appear incomplete. Though we're not shown Carla Jean's death, when Chigurh exits and checks the bottom of his socks [...] for blood, it's a clear indication that his brand of violence has struck again." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{not true}} {{that he would never}} see her again. It {{was not true}} simply because it was impossible. He climbed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and put his head on the pillow. He lay there quite still.|$|E
25|$|Once he {{had tied}} <b>up</b> his victim <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> Ireland again demanded his victim's bank details. This time his victim refused to comply. After killing Collier's cat, Ireland strangled Collier with a noose. He put a condom on Collier's penis {{and placed the}} dead cat's mouth over it, and placed the cat's tail into Collier's mouth. Ireland was angered at {{discovering}} Collier was HIV positive while rummaging through his personal effects looking for bank details. He then phoned the police, asking why they had not linked the four murders. He left the next morning with £70.|$|R
50|$|Tom wakes <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sea <b>bed,</b> {{where he}} finds himself still alive. He starts imitating the majestic sea creatures until he spots Jerry. The cat grabs him, but Jerry pulls away {{revealing}} that {{he has become a}} mer-mouse. Jerry swims in circles until Tom's head has done a 360, and is then grabbed again. Jerry slaps Tom face with his tail, then twists his ears in to the shape of a wrench. The cat gives chase through shipwreck windows until Tom hangs back to swallow the mouse. Jerry breaks out through Tom's left eardrum. Jerry hides and disguises himself as a seahorse to join a father seahorse leading his babies, fooling the cat for only a while. Jerry then gets lassoed and captured, but Tom gets tricked into holding a fishing line and is caught. Tom escapes and chases Jerry into another shipwreck, but Jerry closes <b>the</b> door <b>on</b> him. <b>The</b> anchor of <b>the</b> ship lands <b>on</b> Tom. He emerges with chain rings on his ears and neck.|$|R
50|$|Six months later, she and Ryan {{have broken}} up and Taylor has {{returned}} to Paris. Both of them refuse {{to see each other}} but end up meeting at the airport. It was made very obvious, to them as well as Seth and Summer, that they still had feelings for each other. She was devastated when Ryan told her that the Cohens are moving to Berkeley, meaning she won't be able to see him anymore. They get to talk at the Berkeley house before Julie's wedding. Initially they both agree to be friends but unable to resist they kiss passionately and end <b>up</b> making out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> together, interrupted by the house owner.

60|$|I hardly {{recognised}} him at first. Only {{the poor}} ghost he seemed of the Hal I had {{known as a}} boy. His long privations endured during the Paris siege, added to the superhuman work he had there put upon himself, had commenced the ruin of even his magnificent physique--a ruin the wild, loose life he was now leading was soon to complete. It was a gloomy, vaulted room that once had been a chapel, lighted dimly by a cheap, evil-smelling lamp, heated to suffocation by one of those great green-tiled German ovens now only to be met with in rare out-of-the-way world corners. He was sitting propped <b>up</b> by pillows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> placed close {{to one of the}} high windows, his deep eyes flaring like two gleaming caverns out of his drawn, haggard face.|$|R

60|$|On {{somewhat}} suddenly awaking, after a {{sleep of}} whose length {{he had no}} idea, Oak found that the waggon was in motion. He was being carried along the road at a rate rather considerable for a vehicle without springs, and under circumstances of physical uneasiness, his head being dandled <b>up</b> and down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of <b>the</b> waggon like a kettledrum-stick. He then distinguished voices in conversation, coming from the forpart of the waggon. His concern at this dilemma (which would have been alarm, had he been a thriving man; but misfortune is a fine opiate to personal terror) led him to peer cautiously from the hay, and the first sight he beheld was the stars above him. Charles's Wain was getting towards a right angle with the Pole star, and Gabriel concluded {{that it must be}} about nine o'clock--in other words, that he had slept two hours. This small astronomical calculation was made without any positive effort, and whilst he was stealthily turning to discover, if possible, into whose hands he had fallen.|$|R

5000|$|Like that of {{her last}} single, My Day Will Come, the video was {{directed}} by Bart Borghesi and was shot in Melbourne. It shows Kate walking around {{on a sunny day}} walking across a bridge past two men in suits, one of them knocks her shoulder and his briefcase drops, the two men then begin to argue. It then switches to Kate performing with her band in a park with a crowd. Then it goes to Kate going into {{what seems to be a}} hotel room which belongs to the guy of the song, dropping all <b>the</b> clothes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rail off the hangers and destroying sunglesses and writing the words [...] "knock knock knock" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door. For the second chorus she is performing with her band again. At the bridge she is seen putting super glue in the guy's hair gel. It keeps flipping from Kate performing with the band to Kate in the hotel room, dropping a phone in a goldfish bowl and graffiti-ing the wall.

Of course the story seems absurd, and easy to be {{explained}} by the state of my nerves under the strain which was being put upon them, and for aught I know that may be its true meaning. Yet I am not ashamed to confess that I have always held, and still hold, otherwise. I believe that in my extremity some kindly Power did speak to me in answer to my earnest prayers and to those of others, giving me guidance and, what I needed still more, judgment and calmness. At any rate, that this was my conviction at the moment may be seen from the fact that I hastened to obey the teachings of that tiny, unnatural voice.|$|R

60|$|Naomi was as {{cool and}} defiant as customary. She made them bring Christopher {{in to say}} good-night and had him lifted <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to kiss her. Then she held him {{back and looked at}} him admiringly--at the bright curls and rosy cheeks and round, firm limbs. The boy was uncomfortable under her gaze and squirmed hastily down. Her eyes {{followed}} him greedily, as he went out. When the door closed behind him, she groaned. Sarah Spencer was startled. She had never heard Naomi Holland groan since she had come to wait on her.|$|E
60|$|Immediately {{afterwards}} Paul {{heard the}} mother slowly mounting the stairs. The candlelight flashed {{through the cracks}} in his door. Her dress brushed the door, and his heart jumped. Then it was dark, and he heard the clatter of her latch. She was very leisurely indeed in her preparations for sleep. After a long time it was quite still. He sat strung <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> shivering slightly. His door was an inch open. As Clara came upstairs, he would intercept her. He waited. All was dead silence. The clock struck two. Then he heard a slight scrape of the fender downstairs. Now {{he could not help}} himself. His shivering was uncontrollable. He felt he must go or die.|$|E

He drank from unlabeled pint flasks of whisky all day. Once, when she opened a bureau drawer of his by mistake, she saw half a dozen whisky-flasks mixed with grimy collars, and the sour smell nauseated her. But on food--they had to economize on that! He took her to a restaurant of fifteen-cent breakfasts and twenty-five-cent dinners.

5000|$|The {{first chapter}} of [...] "Trapped in the Closet" [...] begins with the narrator, Sylvester (portrayed by Kelly), waking up and realizing {{that he is not}} in his own bed. He recalls leaving a nightclub with a strange woman the {{previous}} night, and that he was in her bed. As Sylvester is scolding himself for what he has done as a married man, the woman comes back into the bedroom from the bathroom. Sylvester tells her that he has to leave quickly. She tells him he cant leave out the door because she hears her husband coming up the stairs. Sylvester says hell jump out the window, but she reminds him that they are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fifth floor. Sylvester thinks frantically, and then decides to hide in the closet. A few seconds later, the husband walks in, and the couple ends <b>up</b> fooling around <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Sylvester reflects that the woman deserves an Oscar for her skillful acting. Suddenly, Sylvesters cell phone rings and he hurries to put it <b>on</b> vibrate. <b>The</b> husband hears the ring and suspects something is wrong. He searches the house for another person. He looks behind the shower curtain, under <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> in <b>the</b> dresser, and then walks towards the closet.

5000|$|Because Henry Kelly is [...] "the best Fiddler in the Country," [...] {{the crew}} convinces the boss {{to let them}} [...] "treat today like a Saturday" [...] and let them have a party and drink the liquor Ryan bought at the store in Blackville. Ryan has {{a bit too much}} to drink, gets carried away in his Irish dancing, and steps on McPherson's foot. Twice. A fight breaks out, and it takes the whole camp to calm Ryan and McPherson down. After a lullaby by Mr. Kelly, the men go to bed, and one of the characters, {{possibly}} McPherson, walks in covered under a jacket and puts something in Ryan's personal teapot. In most productions, this is where the intermission would begin, and in many cases, a meal be served to the guests by the cast. Turkey was the most common meal. The play then resumes when the crew are just getting out of bed. McGregor complains of symptoms of a hangover, but the boss tells them to go to work anyway. Hogan requests pies for when they get back. Peter Ryan sits down at the table to enjoy his tea, then suddenly collapses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor.

40|$|M. Sc. (Geology) Rocks of the Witwatersrand Super {{group in}} the {{northern}} portion of the East Rand Goldfield have been examined on surface and in underground exposures {{in an attempt to}} establish the chronology, movement vectors, amount of strain and displacement associated with bedding parallel faults. It was found that more than one age of movement occurred along most of the non-bedding parallel fault planes with normal, reverse and strike-slip senses of motion. <b>The</b> ductile <b>bedding</b> plane faults are manifested in all lithologies, but the shale units have, in particular, acted as a locus for shearing and it is suggested that they should be regarded as phyllonites. Bedding parallel faults are generally characterised by the presence of quartz veins and the development of phyllosilicates. They are categorised as mylonitic quartz schists. Syntectonic fault restricted quartz veins generally parallel the foliation, developed in the plane of flattening, and aided the movement of overlying strata during fault formation. Kinematic indicators imply a broad northerly <b>up</b> dip movement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> parallel faults; implying they are thrust faults. Directionally specific kinematic indicators display at least two directions of thrust movement in the Central Rand Group, one to the NE and a second to the N to NW. The second group may represent two overlapping directions of movement. Only NE thrust movement are indicated in the West Rand Group. The NE thrust event occurred after emplacement of Ventersdorp dykes and before deposition of the rocks of the Black Reef Quartzite Formation. The N thrust fault event occurred after deposition of the Black Reef Quartzite Formation and before deposition of Karoo age rocks. A possible third event of Bushveld Igneous Intrusion age may be manifested as thrust faults towards the NW. The contact between the Central and West Rand Groups has acted as a major decollement during the N thrust event. The folds in this region may initially have been the result of thrust faulting towards the NE. Tilting of the fold axes during the postulated NW event is possible...|$|R
