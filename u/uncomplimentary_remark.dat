25|$|Pitt's life {{came to an}} {{end when}} he quarrelled with his friend, Captain Best R.N., over a report that the latter had made an <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remark</b> about Pitt to a lady whose favours Pitt was then enjoying but who had {{previously}} been Best's mistress. Learning of this, Pitt challenged Best and insulted him. The following morning, they met again at a coffee house and Best asked Pitt to withdraw his remarks based upon their former friendship; he refused, possibly knowing that Best's famous skill with the pistol would leave him open to accusations of cowardice.|$|E
6000|$|Owlet, whose nose had {{suggested}} his name, had been {{regardless of the}} poke, the tug, and the pinch, but was alive to the hint. He at once came to the sitting posture on hearing the dreaded name of [...] "bobby," [...] and rubbed his eyes. On seeing that there was neither policeman nor guard near, he uttered an <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remark</b> {{and was about to}} lie down again, but was arrested by the animated expression of his comrade's face and the heaving of his shoulders.|$|E

60|$|Murmuring similar <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks,</b> {{mingled with}} {{expressions}} of surprise, {{the voice of}} the woman gradually died away, and the people in the golden cave were left to discuss their situation and form hasty plans for the present emergency.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you go to}} thunder!" [...] snapped Merwell, {{and pushed}} {{out of the crowd}} as fast as he could. Several {{followed}} him and saw him get his gold piece, and they passed all sorts of <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> on his actions.|$|R
50|$|Pepper Rodgers {{was known}} around the {{football}} {{world as a}} likable man. However, he often made <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> about the Canadian Football League, which also showed signs that the CFL's foray into the United States was doomed to failure from the start.|$|R
6000|$|Holkar, as I {{made these}} <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks,</b> gave a scream of rage, and, drawing his scimitar, rushed on to {{despatch}} me at once (it {{was the very}} thing I wished for), when the third person sprang forward and, seizing his arm, cried - ...|$|R
60|$|But the {{appointed}} hour passed, and the Reverend William Tucker did not appear. Hunters of the Rocky Mountains, however, {{are not an}} impatient race. Reuben quietly waited {{as he would have}} done for a good shot at game. Not so The MacFearsome. His Celtic blood fired, and he muttered a few <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> about the reverend absentee, which it is well not to repeat.|$|R
6000|$|In {{this way}} the tandem riders were carried a good hundred yards or more beyond their quarry. Then Phipps {{realized}} his possibilities, slacked up with the brake, and let the thing go over sideways, dropping on to his right foot. With his left leg still over the saddle, and still holding the handles, he {{looked over his shoulder}} and began addressing <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> to Dangle. [...] "You only think of yourself," [...] said Phipps, with a florid face.|$|R
60|$|But now his {{attention}} was diverted by {{the voice of}} Taug. The threats that had filled the ape's mouth had turned to pleas. The tightening noose was stopping the circulation of the blood in his legs--he was beginning to suffer. Several apes sat near him highly interested in his predicament. They made <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> about him, {{for each of them}} had felt the weight of Taug's mighty hands and the strength of his great jaws. They were enjoying revenge.|$|R
50|$|The Quarterly Review for June 1812 {{contains}} a severe article by Gilchrist on Stephen Jones's edition of David Erskine Baker's Biographia Dramatica. Jones published a reply entitled Hypercriticism Exposed, 1812. The Quarterly Review for October 1820 had some <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> on William Lisle Bowles, {{in a review}} of Spence's Anecdotes. Bowles replied in The Pamphleteer, vol. xvii., ascribing the Quarterly article to Gilchrist, who (while disclaiming the authorship) published a Letter to the Rev. William Lisle Bowles, Stamford, 1820. An acrimonious controversy ensued.|$|R
6000|$|Leaping {{from his}} stool and seizing Aspel by the hand, Mr Blurt {{gave him a}} {{greeting}} so hearty that two street boys who chanced to pass and saw the beginning of it exclaimed, [...] "Go it, old 'un!" [...] and waited for more. But Aspel shut the door in their faces, which induced them to deliver <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> through the keyhole, and make unutterable eyes at the owl in the window ere they went the even tenor of their way.|$|R
60|$|Just {{previous}} to {{the disaster}} to the Maine, {{during the last}} days of January or the first of February, Señor Enrique Dupuy de Lome, the Spanish minister at Washington, wrote a private letter to the editor of the Madrid Herald, Señor Canalejas, who was his intimate friend, in which he made some <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> regarding the President of the United States, and intimated that Spain was not sincere in certain commercial negotiations which were then being carried on between the two countries.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Vanderbilt {{boys are}} sore over the {{treatment}} they received. The Louisiana State University team couldn't take defeat in a sportsmanlike manner. They claimed that Vanderbilt knew their signals and made <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> from their sidelines, and altogether the treatment {{was not as}} good as the team expected. Vanderbilt played a harder game than at Tulane, and Louisiana State University has a much better team than Tulane. Vanderbilt played a much faster game than Louisiana State University and every trick was a success. Louisiana State University depended entirely on straight football and never succeeded in working any trick.|$|R
50|$|A pleased colonial {{government}} now {{turned up the}} heat full blast on George Price. They dismissed him from the Executive Council on the old charge of selling out to Guatemala, giving his opponents something to work with; although Belizeans still debate the relationship between Price and Guatemala, the charges were not immediately serious. In March 1958, a protracted charge of sedition was laid on him for supposedly <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> about the possible reception of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom in Belize. A jury acquitted him and the charges backfired. Moreover, the PUP achieved its greatest electoral dominance in 1961 elections, sweeping all eighteen seats from the hapless National Independence Party.|$|R
6000|$|A {{little later}} a fat, {{half-breed}} man--I should say from his curling hair {{that his mother}} was a negress and his father a Portuguese--appeared with some other nondescript fellows and began to give directions in a competent fashion about our oxen, also as to the killing of a calf. He spoke in bastard Portuguese, which I could understand, and I heard him talk of Umslopogaas to whom he pointed, as [...] "that nigger," [...] after the fashion of such cross-bred people who choose to consider themselves white men. Also he made <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> about Hans, who of course understood every word he said. Evidently Thomaso's temper had been ruffled by this sudden and violent disturbance of his nap.|$|R
60|$|He {{explained}} that during his absence in the dining-car someone had entered his stateroom and stolen his grip and Nan's. I hastened {{at once to}} aid the Rube in his search. The boys swore by everything under and beyond the sun they {{had not seen the}} grips; they appeared very much grieved at the loss and pretended to help in searching the Pullman. At last, with the assistance of a porter, we discovered the missing grips in an upper berth. The Rube carried them off to his stateroom and we knew soon from his <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> that the contents of the suitcases had been mixed and manhandled. But he did not hunt for the jokers.|$|R
5|$|Grassi's {{arguments}} and conclusions were criticised {{in a subsequent}} article, Discourse on Comets, published {{under the name of}} one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named Mario Guiducci, although it had been largely written by Galileo himself. Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken. In its opening passage, Galileo and Guiducci's Discourse gratuitously insulted the Jesuit Christopher Scheiner, and various <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> about the professors of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work. The Jesuits were offended, and Grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own, The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance, under the pseudonym Lothario Sarsio Sigensano, purporting to be one of his own pupils.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should not}} have said {{anything}} about it,' the other returned, 'if I had had any idea that her engagement with Halliburn would come to nothing. We had been talking over that business of hers, and I expressed my opinion pretty strongly as to Halliburn's behaviour to her in public and said that I wondered she stood it. Then getting heated I was ass {{enough to say that}} had I been in his position, I should have behaved in a different sort of way, and generally expressed my contempt for him. Then you asked why hadn't I put myself in his position, and I told you it was no fault of mine, for that I had tried and failed, when you made some <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> as to her taste, and we nearly had a row.|$|R
5000|$|Nadal was {{convinced}} his own Mariamne had failed because of Voltaire's [...] "brigue horrible et scandaleuse" [...] that set Paris against it, and said {{so in the}} preface to the printed play, accusing him of bringing a cabal into the audience at the premiere to disrupt it. This gave Voltaire the opportunity to reply under a pseudonym with withering compliments ("Lettre de M. Thieriot à M. l'Abbé Nadal", 1725), commiserating with Nadal, that it was solely the machinations of Voltaire's intrigues [...] "that one hears it said so scandalously that you are the worst versifier of the century and the most tiresome writer." [...] Voltaire's fine-honed savagery inspired Nadal to excise the <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> about Voltaire in his prefaces when he came to collect and publish the plays in 1736 with others of his poems, in three small volumes. But it is in Voltaire's response that the abbé Nadal is remembered.|$|R
6000|$|Walter's duty at his gun {{came to an}} end at midnight, {{and none}} too soon for the lad, whose head had {{suddenly}} begun to spin around like a top. [...] "I guess I'm getting seasick," [...] he murmured to Si; and the Yankee lad at once led him away to a secluded corner, where he might have matters all his own way, and where none might look on and enjoy his misery. Once Haskett started to pass some <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> about Walter, but a single stern look from Caleb silenced the seaman, who tumbled into his hammock without another word. For several days Jim Haskett had kept his distance, but he was only biding his time to [...] "even up," [...] as he termed it. [...] "I'll make young Russell feel mighty sore before I'm done with him," [...] was what he promised himself.|$|R
60|$|The Sevillans {{are perhaps}} {{inclined}} to stoutness, {{but that is}} a charm in their lover's sight, and often have a little down on the upper lip, than which, when it amounts to no more than a shadow, nothing can be more enchanting. They look with malicious eyes as you saunter through room after room in the factory; it is quite an experience to run the gauntlet of their numerous tongues, making <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> about your person, sometimes to your embarrassment offering you the carnation from their hair, or other things. Their clothes are suspended to the pillars, and their costume in summer is more adapted for coolness than for the inspection of decorous foreigners. They may bring with them babies, and many a girl will have a cradle by her side, which she rocks with one foot as her fingers work nimbly at the cigarettes.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{included}} in Le Parnasse françois project of Évrard Titon du Tillet, which provoked Voltaire's sarcastic epigram (see Évrard Titon du Tillet).

60|$|For a {{time the}} {{operation}} of chairing Fenn up the steps occupied the active minds of the Kayites. When he had disappeared into the first eleven room, they turned their attention in other directions. Caustic and <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> began to fly to and fro between the representatives of Kay's and Blackburn's. It is not known who actually administered the first blow. But, when Fenn {{came out of the}} pavilion with Kennedy and Silver, he found a stirring battle in progress. The members of the other houses who had come to look on at the match stood in knots, and gazed with approval at the efforts of Kay's and Blackburn's juniors to wipe each other {{off the face of the}} earth. The air was full of shrill battle-cries, varied now and then by a smack or a thud, as some young but strenuous fist found a billet. The fortune of war seemed to be distributed equally so far, and the combatants were just warming to their work.|$|R
5000|$|... "Vanderbilt {{kicked off}} and Louisiana State University lost on downs {{in the second}} half. The {{visitors}} advanced the ball for a touchdown. Davis failed, in kicking a goal. Louisiana State University seemed to be very weak. Vanderbilt made her gains every time, and only lost the ball on fumbles. Louisiana State University never advanced far before losing on downs, they were entirely outclassed in weight and skill. It {{is hard to say}} who were the star players for Vanderbilt. Every man played a good game. The playing of Edgerton, Davis, Tigert, and Lawler deserves special notice. For Louisiana State University the playing of Sales, deserves notice."The Vanderbilt boys are sore over the treatment they received. The Louisiana State University team couldn't take defeat in a sportsmanlike manner. They claimed that Vanderbilt knew their signals and made <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> from their sidelines, and altogether the treatment was not as good as the team expected.

40|$|This {{past summer}} as our SQI group {{was holding a}} worship service {{in the ruins of}} a synagogue on top of Masada, a Canadian Jew took {{advantage}} of a pause in the sermon to give us some of his philosophy. He asked us why we had picked the synagogue, of all places, as a place for a Christian service. He then went on to complain that for centuries Christians had been killing Jews in the name of religion. His most biting remark, however, was when he accused us of blaspheming that synagogue and the name of God by preaching the Gospel of Jesus. I wonder what he would have said if he had known that it was a Lutheran worship service? On another part of the trip, some of the Israelis at the dig, who knew that we were Lutherans, made a few <b>uncomplimentary</b> <b>remarks</b> about Martin Luther. They were equating Luther and Hitler; in a sense, they were accusing Luther of being partially responsible for the terrible Jewish holocaust of Nazi Germany. These accusations, of course, did not sit very well with me. I decided to look into the documents and their historical setting. This paper, then, will center on this question: Can Luther rightly be labeled an antisemite? Many Luther scholars say that Luther's views of the Jews underwent an extreme change in his lifetime. They claim that Luther at first showed friendship and compassion to the Jew...|$|R
60|$|Those ironical cheers, {{and all his}} cousin's {{behaviour}} during dinner, {{had struck}} young Clive, who was growing very angry. He growled out <b>remarks</b> <b>uncomplimentary</b> to Barnes. His eyes, as he looked towards his kinsman, flashed out challenges, of which we who were watching him could see the warlike purport. Warrington looked at Bayham and Pendennis with glances of apprehension. We saw that danger was brooding, unless the one young man could be restrained from his impertinence, and the other from his wine.|$|R
6000|$|I am glad I {{am not an}} American husband. At {{first sight}} this may appear a <b>remark</b> <b>uncomplimentary</b> to the American wife. It is nothing of the sort. It is the other way about. We, in Europe, have plenty of {{opportunity}} of judging the American wife. In America you hear of the American wife, you are told stories about the American wife, you see her portrait in the illustrated journals. By searching under the heading [...] "Foreign Intelligence," [...] {{you can find out}} what she is doing. But here in Europe we know her, meet her face to face, talk to her, flirt with her. She is charming, delightful. That is why I say I am glad I am not an American husband. If the American husband only knew how nice was the American wife, he would sell his business and come over here, where now and then he could see her.|$|R
