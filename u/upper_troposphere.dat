5|$|Carbon-14 (C) is a {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope, {{created in the}} upper atmosphere (lower stratosphere and <b>upper</b> <b>troposphere)</b> by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays. It is found in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%), mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits, particularly of peat and other organic materials. This isotope decays by 0.158MeV β emission. Because of its relatively short half-life of 5730years, C is virtually absent in ancient rocks. The amount of C in the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in radiocarbon dating, invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000years.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Twelve formed {{over the}} southeastern Bahamas at 5:00p.m. EDT (2100 UTC) on August 23, 2005, {{partially}} from {{the remains of}} Tropical Depression Ten, which had dissipated due {{to the effects of}} a nearby upper tropospheric trough. While the normal standards for numbering tropical depressions in the Atlantic indicate that the old name/number is retained when a depression dissipates and regenerates, satellite data indicated that a second tropical wave combined with Tropical Depression Ten north of Puerto Rico to form a new, much more advanced system, which was then designated as Tropical Depression Twelve. Simultaneously, the trough in the <b>upper</b> <b>troposphere</b> weakened, causing the wind shear in the area to relax, thereby allowing the new tropical depression to develop. In a later re-analysis, it was determined that the low-level circulation of Ten had completely detached and dissipated, with only the remnant mid-level circulation moving on and merging with the aforementioned second tropical wave. As a result, the criteria for keeping the same name and identity were not met.|$|E
5|$|All winds on Venus are {{ultimately}} driven by convection. Hot air {{rises in the}} equatorial zone, where solar heating is concentrated, and flows to the poles. Such an almost-planetwide overturning of the troposphere is called Hadley circulation. However, the meridional air motions are much slower than zonal winds. The poleward limit of the planet wide Hadley cell on Venus is near ±60° latitudes. Here air starts to descend {{and returns to the}} equator below the clouds. This interpretation is supported by the distribution of the carbon monoxide, which is also concentrated in the vicinity of ±60° latitudes. Poleward of the Hadley cell a different pattern of circulation is observed. In the latitude range 60°–70° cold polar collars exist. They are characterised by temperatures about 30–40K lower than in the <b>upper</b> <b>troposphere</b> at nearby latitudes. The lower temperature is probably caused by the upwelling of the air in them and by the resulting adiabatic cooling. Such an interpretation is supported by the denser and higher clouds in the collars. The clouds lie at 70–72km altitude in the collars—about 5km higher than at the poles and low latitudes. A connection may exist between the cold collars and high speed midlatitude jets in which winds blow as fast as 140m/s. Such jets are a natural consequence of the Hadley–type circulation and should exist on Venus between 55–60° latitude.|$|E

40|$|A zonally symmetric, linear radiative-dynamical {{model is}} {{compared}} with {{observations of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>tropospheres</b> and stratospheres of the outer planets. Seasonal variation {{is included in the}} model. Friction is parameterized by linear drag (Rayleigh friction). Gas opacities are accounted for but aerosols are omitted. Horizontal temperature gradients are small on all the planets. Seasonal effects are strongest on Saturn and Neptune but are weak even in these cases, because the latitudinal gradient of radiative heating is weak. Seasonal effects on Uranus are extremely weak because the radiative time constant is longer than the orbital period. One free parameter in the model is the frictional time constant. Comparison with observed temperature perturbations over zonal currents in the troposphere shows that the frictional time constant is on the same order as the radiative time constant for all these objects. Vertical motions predicted by the model are extremely weak.

5|$|The {{circulation}} in Venus's troposphere follows the so-called cyclostrophic approximation. Its windspeeds are roughly {{determined by the}} balance of the pressure gradient and centrifugal forces in almost purely zonal flow. In contrast, the {{circulation in}} the Earth's atmosphere is governed by the geostrophic balance. Venus's windspeeds can be directly measured only in the <b>upper</b> <b>troposphere</b> (tropopause), between 60–70km, altitude, which corresponds to the upper cloud deck. The cloud motion is usually observed in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, where the contrast between clouds is the highest. The linear wind speeds at this level are about 100±10m/s at lower than 50° latitude. They are retrograde {{in the sense that they}} blow in the direction of the retrograde rotation of the planet. The winds quickly decrease towards the higher latitudes, eventually reaching zero at the poles. Such strong cloud-top winds cause a phenomenon known as the super-rotation of the atmosphere. In other words, these high-speed winds circle the whole planet faster than the planet itself rotates. The super-rotation on Venus is differential, which means that the equatorial troposphere super-rotates more slowly than the troposphere at the midlatitudes. The winds also have a strong vertical gradient. They decline deep in the troposphere with the rate of 3m/sperkm. The winds near the surface of Venus are much slower than that on Earth. They actually move at only a few kilometres per hour (generally less than 2m/s and with an average of 0.3 to 1.0m/s), but due to the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, this is still enough to transport dust and small stones across the surface, much like a slow-moving current of water.|$|E

The JMA hindcast climatology during JJAS simulates the rainfall maxima over the west-coast of India and the head Bay of Bengal reasonably well, although, the latter is slightly shifted southwestward. Associated with better forecast skills of El Nino in the JMA model, the interannual variability of All India Summer Monsoon Rainfall (AISMR) during the 32 -year period has also been very well simulated with a high significant (99 % level) correlation in April ensemble followed by that of March and May ensembles.

25|$|Sulfate {{aerosols}} promote complex {{chemical reactions}} on their surfaces that alter chlorine and nitrogen chemical {{species in the}} stratosphere. This effect, together with increased stratospheric chlorine levels from chlorofluorocarbon pollution, generates chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys ozone (O3). As the aerosols grow and coagulate, they settle down into the <b>upper</b> <b>troposphere</b> where they serve as nuclei for cirrus clouds and further modify the Earth's radiation balance. Most of the hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) are dissolved in water droplets in the eruption cloud and quickly {{fall to the ground}} as acid rain.

25|$|The {{third most}} {{abundant}} constituent of the Uranian atmosphere is methane , {{the presence of}} which has been known for some time {{as a result of the}} ground-based spectroscopic observations. Methane possesses prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared, making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour. Below the methane cloud deck at 1.3bar methane molecules account for about 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction; about 10 to 30 times that found in the Sun. The mixing ratio is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to the extremely low temperature at the tropopause, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out. Methane appears to be undersaturated in the <b>upper</b> <b>troposphere</b> above the clouds having a partial pressure of only 30% of the saturated vapor pressure there. The concentration of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere is poorly known. However, as with methane, their abundances are probably greater than solar values by a factor of at least 20 to 30, and possibly by a factor of a few hundred.|$|E
40|$|The {{compositions}} of the atmospheres of {{the outer}} planets are dominated by molecular hydrogen. The hydrogen ortho and para forms (proton spins parallel and antiparallel) are observed to have ratios {{that are not in}} thermodynamic equilibrium, with spatial variations, probably due to vertical motions that transport fluid from a different temperature regime. Conversion between the two forms produces significant "latent heat" release, but conversion is thought to be so slow that this heating is extremely small. Because the two forms of hydrogen have different specific heats and their abundance ratio is spatially variable, Ertel's potential vorticity is not conserved, even in the adiabatic and frictionless limit. In this paper the degree of nonconservation is assessed by scale analysis, for typical observed ortho-para inhomogeneity. A numerical example similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot is presented. Analysis is restricted to large-scale motions in the stable <b>upper</b> <b>tropospheres</b> of the planets, where the quasigeostrophic approximation applies. A major result is that a generalization of quasigeostrophic potential vorticity is still conserved, and that the para fraction is merely an inert tracer in this regime. The Ertel isentropic potential vorticity is not conserved, even to leading order, except in special regions where the ortho-para ratio is exceptionally homogeneous. © 2004 American Meteorological Society...|$|R

25|$|The Earth and {{all living}} things on it are {{constantly}} bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from protons to iron and larger nuclei derived sources outside our solar system. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create an air shower of secondary radiation, including X-rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, pions, electrons, and neutrons. The immediate dose from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, and this dose varies {{in different parts of}} the world based largely on the geomagnetic field and altitude. For example, the city of Denver in the United States (at 1650 meters elevation) receives a cosmic ray dose roughly twice that of a location at sea level. This radiation is much more intense in the <b>upper</b> <b>troposphere,</b> around 10km altitude, and is thus of particular concern for airline crews and frequent passengers, who spend many hours per year in this environment.

25|$|The {{tracking}} of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds {{blowing in the}} <b>upper</b> <b>troposphere</b> of Uranus. At the equator winds are retrograde, {{which means that they}} blow in the reverse direction to the planetary rotation. Their speeds are from −100 to −50m/s. Wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator, reaching zero values near ±20° latitude, where the troposphere's temperature minimum is located. Closer to the poles, the winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with its rotation. Wind speeds continue to increase reaching maxima at ±60° latitude before falling to zero at the poles. Wind speeds at −40° latitude range from 150 to 200m/s. Because the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel, speeds between it and the south pole are impossible to measure. In contrast, in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as 240m/s are observed near +50 degrees of latitude. These speeds sometimes lead to incorrect assertions that winds are faster in the northern hemisphere. In fact, latitude per latitude, winds are slightly slower {{in the northern part of}} Uranus, especially at the midlatitudes from ±20 to ±40 degrees. There is currently no agreement about whether any changes in wind speed have occurred since 1986, and nothing is known about much slower meridional winds.|$|E

A cloud-resolving model is {{used to test the}} Fixed Anvil Temperature (FAT) Hypothesis {{proposed}} by Hartmann and Larson (2002). Results show that the radiative cooling, primarily due to water vapor, is the strongest control of the anvil cloud detrainment temperature. Water vapor concentrations are largely controlled by temperature, so, following the FAT hypothesis, the cloud detrainment should follow a fixed temperature. The results also show, however, that ozone contributes a significant heating rate in the <b>upper</b> tropical <b>troposphere.</b> If ozone is fixed as a function of pressure as the SST is warmed, anvil clouds warm and their fractional coverage decreases.
