This network is a generalised form of a real-world application, already developed under the Lotus Platform. This application ensures the restricted access of several authorised persons from local public institutions to log to a central server and to access the appropriate interfaces {{that allow them to}} send information. Other users are able to initiate the data collecting process. This project has as a result an automated data collecting system and has other useful functions as: centralisation of the data in a protected database, access to automated reports, public access to certain information via a WEB site, selective access to the database, accordingly {{to the role of the}} <b>users,</b> <b>customisation</b> of the interfaces, data exchange with other information systems etc. The solution will contribute to the genericity, and customisation improvement by a research with the objectives emphasised in the paper. This research will yield a software pattern, and also suggests several ways to make easy the customisation, including an original representation of the information.

They dynamically adapt its behavior at run-time in response to changing conditions in end-user needs and the surrounding environment devices. From the development point of view, producing and maintaining {{a large amount of}} autonomic homes need an affordable solution such as dynamic software product lines (DSPL). DSPL produce a set of products that share features and have the ability of reconfiguring at runtime. Since users maintain and modify their preferences in opportunistic and improvisational ways, an autonomic home must evolve in time according to user expectations. Current DSPL architectures implement the ability of recon- figuring a product but ignore user preferences.

40|$|Intelligent Networks (IN) is {{a revolutionary}} concept in {{telecommunications}} and many network operators and researchers have already invested {{a great deal}} of money and effort towards this trend. IN promises to augment the existing networks with the appropriate intelligence which will enable them to build, test, manage, maintain, change, dispose and withdraw services easily, rapidly and cost-effectively. Consequently, the increasing and changing demands of the customers are fulfilled in shorter periods of time, and moreover, IN provides a <b>user</b> <b>customisation</b> environment allowing the customers to specify their own services. One of the key elements for the success of the integration of IN into Broadband Networks, called B-IN, is the Broadband Intelligent Peripheral (B-IP) which is considered as an intermediate unit facilitating the communication of a non-IN-aware Broadband terminal with the Broadband Intelligent Network. A generic architecture of a B-IP as well as a particular implementation are the main considerations of this paper. The paper investigates the integration of the B-IP with other emerging and well-established technologies, such as mobile agents and the Internet. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis addresses one major difficulty in formal proof: removing obstructions to intuition which hamper the proof endeavour. We investigate {{this in the}} context of formally verifying geometric algorithms using the theorem prover Isabelle, by first proving the Graham’s Scan algorithm for finding convex hulls, then using the challenges we encountered as motivations for the design of a general, modular framework for combining mathematical tools. We introduce our integration framework — the Prover’s Palette, describing in detail the guiding principles from software engineering and the key differentiator of our approach — emphasising the role of the user. Two integrations are described, using the framework to extend Eclipse Proof General so that the computer algebra systems QEPCAD and Maple are directly available in an Isabelle proof context, capable of running either fully automated or with <b>user</b> <b>customisation.</b> The versatility of the approach is illustrated by showing a variety of ways that these tools can be used to streamline the theorem proving process, enriching the user’s intuition rather than disrupting it. The usefulness of our approach is then demonstrated through the formal verification of an algorithm for computing Delaunay triangulations in the Prover’s Palette...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} work {{towards the}} deployment of flexible self-management into realtime embedded systems. A challenging project DySCAS which focused specifically {{on the development of}} a dynamic, adaptive automotive middleware is described. The self-management and context-awareness requirements of the middleware have been identified through the refinement of a wide-ranging set of Use cases, a sample of which are presented. The embedded and real-time nature of the target system brings the constraints that dynamic adaptation capabilities must not require changes to the deployed executable code, adaptation decisions must have low latency, and because the target platforms are resource-constrained the self-management mechanism must have low resource requirements (especially in terms of processing and memory). The incorporation of policy-based self-management in this situation satisfies all of these requirements and in addition yields a highly flexible system that can be tailored for specific deployment-systems. The policy logic is independent of the deployed code, can be loaded at run-time and easily replaced or changed subsequently to cater for <b>user</b> <b>customisation</b> or changes in application requirements. The architecture of a designed-for-purpose powerful yet lightweight AGILE_Lite policy library is described.

It is important to see service creation in context, it is not an end in itself but comes after a phase of definition, which might include marketing and major customers inputs, and is followed by the deployment, monitoring and use of the service. Throughout the lifetime of the service there will be modifications and then finally phasing out, possibly with something else as a replacement. Our approach has been to build various tools to support services throughout the lifecycle to edit, test, monitor and improve services. I.

30|$|Visually {{impaired}} individuals often {{suffer a}} loss from high spatial frequency information, while current traditional approaches {{are limited in}} effectiveness, practicality and application. A video processing HMD visual aid embedded device can enhance and provide augmented vision for the visually impaired, offering a degree of visual aid and practical use currently unobtainable with traditional visual aid technology. Morphological operations were applied to extract image edges for augmenting high spatial frequencies for the visually impaired, resulting in three possible edge gradient types. The proposed flexible design allows edge detection of morphological, internal and external gradient techniques to be obtained from within the same architecture, where the edge thickness can be modified by adjusting SE size and shape. While current trends in augmented vision for the visually impaired have extensively utilised binary-based edge overlaying systems, e.g. Sobel edge detection, with a rigid and fixed implementation [7 – 10, 13 – 15, 18 – 20], the proposed method is highly flexible, offering {{a high degree of}} real-time <b>user</b> <b>customisation,</b> where the user can switch between various morphology edge gradient techniques of selectable magnitude and edge thickness. The proposed grayscale morphological architecture exploits duality, capable of producing erosion and dilation functions from the same morphological operation architecture. The morphology operators allow current configurations to be changed during implementation, where SE can be reconfigured to any shape or size within the maximum synthesised SE boundaries, allowing pixels outside the image boundaries to be effectively ignored and obtain a large degree of system flexibility. Realisation of this level of reconfiguration requires more FPGA chip space and obtains a 2 % decrease in throughput compared to a directly mapped morphological gradient on FPGA with fixed parameters [25]. The gradient edge detection system on a Virtex- 5 device is capable of meeting real-time constraints for HD image and video applications, obtaining 705, 266 and 93 fps for VGA, XGA and HD image dimensions, respectively. The proposed edge enhancement device is capable of processing standard HMD resolution of VGA dimensions in real-time, offering a degree of user algorithm customisation and flexibility that has not been previously implemented in visual aid devices or morphological architecture.|$|E

The user can freely define the required documentation masks which are easily expandable and can be adapted to individual requirements without the need for additional programming. To avoid duplication, data transfer interfaces can be configured flexibly to external sources such as patient management systems used in surgeries or hospital information systems. The projects EvaMed (Evaluation Anthroposophical Medicine) and the Network Oncology are two scientific research projects which have been successfully established as nationally active networks on the basis of QuaDoSta.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to explore the use of Mobile Shower Commodes (MSCs) by adults with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) and to {{understand}} how adults with SCI and expert clinicians identify and select MSC designs and features. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven adults with SCI and eight expert clinical prescribers using semi-structured guides. Transcripts were analysed thematically using the Policy, Human, Activity, Assistance and Technology, and Environment (PHAATE) model as the underpinning theoretical framework. Results: Analysis of the interview transcripts revealed 3 themes and 12 sub-themes. The main themes were: (1) Activities, routines and interacting factors, (2) Features for functioning and (3) Getting it right. Substantial links existed between and across the themes and subthemes. Conclusions: The use of MSCs by adults with SCI is complex. MSC performance varies across activities, and during interactions between the user, the MSC, other assistive technologies, assistance and physical environments. Future studies should explore service delivery processes and develop validated clinical assessment instruments and outcome measures for MSC provision.

In this paper we describe the selection and pilot of a B 2 B e-service in the firm GE Plastics Europe (GEP). The practical aim of the research was to get new customers by turning website visitors into commercial leads and to deliver better services to them. The scientific objective of our research was to develop and test an e-services quality model. We reviewed literature and developed an integrated Sales Supporting E-services Quality model (SSEQ model) consisting of the following components: technical reliability, functional reliability, responsiveness, <b>user</b> interface, assurance, <b>customisation,</b> and empathy. We used the SSEQ model at GE Plastics for generating 36 new e-services (by means of brainstorming sessions and interviews), for pre-selecting e-services, for implementing one new e-service (Web Radar) in detail through a pilot, and finally for evaluating the e-service pilot. The Web Radar service allows a GEP employee to monitor real-time who is visiting the website. The employee can then offer a chat window to the customer in order to provide sales assistance. The chat acceptance rate in the pilot was 40 %. GEP and the customers were satisfied with the results from the pilot study and GEP intends to implement the Web Radar company-wide. Overall, we found that the SSEQ model was very helpful in identifying potentially successful e-services by supporting the company in reviewing 36 e-services thoroughly ex ante. This ex ante evaluation is valuable given numerous failed initiatives related to the use of Internet channels. Evidently, a high rating ex ante does not guarantee success, but it is expected to give better and more thorough insight into the e-services before implementing them full scale. 1...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a pilot project which was {{developed}} {{to meet the needs of}} specific research groups for a collaborative workspace. The main components of the project include a digital library, online discussion forum, adaptive hypermedia engine and a statement database. Such a system was deemed necessary because of today's global network of researchers who are divided by both location and time. The need therefore exists for a system which allows researchers to work on a project without the need to be in the same physical location. Such a system is called an online collaborative workspace. An online collaborative workspace allows researchers to work together on projects by providing various means of sharing information and resources. The main research question addressed in this study is:  What are the user requirements and design specifications of an online collaborative workspace developed in open source software? In order to answer this main question, the following sub-questions need to be addressed:  What are the main design principles and functionalities of such a collaborative workspace?  How can they be integrated in developing a modular open source framework?  To what extent can such a framework be customised for implementation in new or existing collaborative projects?  What are the usability requirements of such an online collaborative workspace and how should one go about to test the usability of such a framework? Before being able to accurately determine the user requirements of an online collaborative workspace, we first need to determine which features exist in current systems. The main question driving the literature survey therefore is:  What are the main components of current online collaborative workspaces as reported in the literature? Chapter 2 of this report is devoted to identifying and researching the various components that define an online collaborative workspace. Each of these components are investigated in detail by means of informal interviews as well as a literature survey. The components that were identified include a digital library, online discussion forum and collaborative workspace. In addition to identifying the various components, this chapter also addresses the motivation for the use of open source software and the importance of usability. With the information obtained in chapter 2, chapter 3 sets out to develop a framework which addresses each of the components that were identified. The various features and properties of each component were identified and decisions were made with regard to the best method of implementation. In addition to the components that were developed, this chapter also focuses on various design implications such as modularity and the use of open source software. Chapter 4 describes the various projects where the framework was implemented. For each of the projects the <b>user</b> requirements, <b>customisations</b> and usability issues are addressed. This chapter highlights the framework's ability to be customised to suit the diverse needs of research projects. The final chapter provides a set of conclusions summarising how the main objectives of the study were addressed. Moreover, the limitations of the study are addressed and an outline is provided as to how these limitations are to be addressed in future work.
