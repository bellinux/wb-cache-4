(For an elementary discussion, see Phase-contrast x-ray imaging (introduction). For a more in-depth review, see Phase-contrast X-ray imaging.) It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures {{in a wide range of}} biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, talbot interferometry, moiré-based far-field interferometry, refraction-enhanced imaging, and x-ray interferometry. These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging, making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, x-ray optics, or high resolution x-ray detectors.|$|E

After 40 years the cellulose fibers are replaced and the old fibers are disposed of, possibly incinerated. All inputs and outputs are considered for all the phases of the life cycle.|$|E

25|$|Cradle-to-gate is an {{assessment}} of a partial product life cycle from resource extraction (cradle) to the factory gate (i.e., before it is transported to the consumer). The <b>use</b> <b>phase</b> and disposal phase of the product are omitted in this case. Cradle-to-gate assessments are sometimes the basis for environmental product declarations (EPD) termed business-to-business EDPs. One of the significant uses of the cradle-to-gate approach compiles the life cycle inventory (LCI) using cradle-to-gate. This allows the LCA to collect all of the impacts leading up to resources being purchased by the facility. They can then add the steps involved in their transport to plant and manufacture process to more easily produce their own cradle-to-gate values for their products.|$|E

25|$|The {{life cycle}} {{considered}} usually {{consists of a}} number of stages including: materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined, then impact on the environment can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example, the most energy-intensive life phase of an airplane or car is during use due to fuel consumption. One of the most effective ways to increase fuel efficiency is to decrease vehicle weight, and thus, car and airplane manufacturers can decrease environmental impact in a significant way by replacing heavier materials with lighter ones such as aluminium or carbon fiber-reinforced elements. The reduction during the <b>use</b> <b>phase</b> should be more than enough to balance additional raw material or manufacturing cost.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} a design method for robust control systems with robust {{stability}} for minimum <b>phase</b> systems <b>using</b> <b>phase</b> information. Yamada clarified that, <b>using</b> <b>phase</b> information, low sensitivity control systems with robust stability {{can be achieved}} if the relative degree of plant is equal to or 1 -degree smaller {{than that of the}} nominal plant. In many cases, it is difficult to obtain the accurate relative degree of plant. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to expand the result by Yamada and give a design method for low sensitivity control system for the system with uncertain relative degree <b>using</b> <b>phase</b> information. In order to design low sensitivity control with robust stability, we adapt the idea of fusion of robust control design <b>using</b> <b>phase</b> information and the parallel compensation technique. A design procedure for low sensitivity control with robust stability is presented. Finally, without solving interpolation problem, a design method for low sensitivity robust servo control systems with robust stability is presented...|$|R
25|$|This protocol, {{known as}} BB84 after its inventors and year of publication, was {{originally}} described using photon polarization states to transmit the information. However, any {{two pairs of}} conjugate states {{can be used for}} the protocol, and many optical fibre based implementations described as BB84 <b>use</b> <b>phase</b> encoded states. The sender (traditionally referred to as Alice) and the receiver (Bob) are connected by a quantum communication channel which allows quantum states to be transmitted. In the case of photons this channel is generally either an optical fibre or simply free space. In addition they communicate via a public classical channel, for example using broadcast radio or the internet. Neither of these channels need to be secure; the protocol is designed with the assumption that an eavesdropper (referred to as Eve) can interfere in any way with both.|$|E

When the actual EU-27 electricity mix is considered, the e-Golf emissions are still 26% lower than those of the conventional Golf 1.2 TSI.

2500|$|There are {{a limited}} number of {{published}} studies to address the environmental impacts of perovskite solar cells. The major environmental concern is the lead used in the absorber layer. Due to the instability of perovskite cells lead may eventually be exposed to fresh water during the <b>use</b> <b>phase.</b> These LCA [...] studies looked at human and ecotoxicity of perovskite solar cells and found they were [...] surprisingly low and may not be an environmental issue. [...] Global warming potential of perovskite PVs were found to be in the range of 24–1500 grams CO2-eq/kWh electricity production. Similarly, reported EPBT of the published paper range from 0.2 to 15 years. The large range of reported values highlight the uncertainties associated with these studies. Celik et al. (2016) critically discussed the assumptions made in perovskite PV LCA studies.|$|E
