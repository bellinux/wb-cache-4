5000|$|The Confederation was {{established}} in 1990 {{under the leadership of}} independent labour leader Lau Chin-shek. It was largely as a coalition of the [...] "independent" [...] and [...] "politically" [...] <b>unaffiliated</b> <b>union</b> organisations, most of which were new white-collar unions organising the civil service and professional or service employees in the public and subvented sectors, including the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union and the Hong Kong Social Workers General Union. The HKCTU {{has its roots in the}} Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee (HKCIC), a church-sponsored labour organisation largely involved in the grassroots movements in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|As {{might be}} expected, the 1922 RILU Congress {{spent much of}} its time shaping the {{application}} of the Comintern's recently adopted united front policy to the trade union movement. With the prospects for imminent world revolution on the wane, RILU head Solomon Lozovsky proposed an international conference bringing together leaderships of RILU, the Amsterdam International, and various <b>unaffiliated</b> <b>unions</b> — a gathering which was to echo the April 1922 meeting between the Second International, the Two-and-a-Half International, and the Comintern in Berlin [...] "to work out parallel forms and methods of struggle against the offensive of capitalism." ...|$|R
5000|$|The strike failed. Many locals struck {{without the}} support of the {{corresponding}} Seamen's Union locals and against the active resistance of Ryan. [...] The NAACP's publication The Crisis pointed out that New Orleans already had two strong <b>unaffiliated</b> longshore <b>unions</b> (one white, one black) which kept working all through the strike, that the ILA's forced closure of other Gulf ports had only driven ship traffic towards New Orleans, and that change might be permanent.|$|R
25|$|The {{historic}} {{decline in}} union membership {{over the past}} half century has been accompanied by a growing disparity between public sector and private sector union membership percentages. The three most significant labor groupings in the Democratic coalition today are the AFL-CIO and Change to Win labor federations, as well as the National Education Association, a large, <b>unaffiliated</b> teachers' <b>union.</b> Both the AFL-CIO and Change to Win have identified their top legislative priority for 2007 as passage of the Employee Free Choice Act. Other important issues for labor unions include supporting industrial policy (including protectionism) that sustains unionized manufacturing jobs, raising the minimum wage and promoting broad social programs such as Social Security and universal health care.|$|R
5000|$|In 1961 Lew Grade {{offered the}} duo a {{series for the}} London-based ITV station ATV. Entitled Two of a Kind, {{it was written by}} Dick Hills and Sid Green. An Equity strike halted that show, but Morecambe and Wise were members of Variety Artists' Federation, then a {{separate}} trade <b>union</b> <b>unaffiliated</b> with Equity. Hills and Green later appeared in the series as [...] "Sid" [...] and [...] "Dick".|$|R
50|$|The {{war powers}} {{bestowed}} by the Act were first used in August 1944 when the Fair Employment Practices Commission ordered the Philadelphia Transportation Company to hire African-Americans as motormen. The 10,000 {{members of the}} Philadelphia Rapid Transit Employees Union (PRTEU), a labor <b>union</b> <b>unaffiliated</b> with either the American Federation of Labor or the Congress of Industrial Organizations, led a sick-out strike, {{now known as the}} Philadelphia transit strike of 1944, for six days. President Roosevelt sent 8,000 United States Army troops to the city to seize and operate the transit system, and threatened to draft any PRTEU member who did not return to the job within 48 hours. Roosevelt's actions broke the strike.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{examines}} the New Left’s {{impact on the}} Canadian labour movement in the 1960 s and 1970 s. Specifically, it argues that in large industrial unions such as the UAW, New Left ideas that were popular amongst {{the rank and file}} were stifled by the more conservative labour bureaucrats. However, in public sector <b>unions</b> and <b>unions</b> <b>unaffiliated</b> with the Canadian Labour Congress, New Left ideas were often able to flourish, and these more radical unions were sometimes able to obtain substantial gains for their members throughout the 1970 s while also fostering a broader sense of class consciousness in Canadian society [...] culminating most notably in the Common Front’s general strikes in Quebec. Furthermore, this essay suggests that New Left ideas were more popular in public sector and independent unions because these unions had a larger proportion of women in comparison to other unions, and women at this time had a greater incentive to embrace transformative ideologies than men...|$|R
