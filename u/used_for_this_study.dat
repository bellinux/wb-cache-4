50|$|The carrier {{transport}} in OFET is specific for two-dimensional (2D) carrier propagation through the device. Various experimental techniques were <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> such as Haynes - Shockley experiment on the transit times of injected carriers, time-of-flight (TOF) experiment for {{the determination of}} carrier mobility, pressure-wave propagation experiment for probing electric-field distribution in insulators, organic monolayer experiment for probing orientational dipolar changes, optical time-resolved second harmonic generation (TRM-SHG), etc. Whereas carriers propagate through polycrystalline OFETs in a diffusion-like (trap-limited) manner, they move through the conduction band in the best single-crystalline OFETs.|$|E
50|$|From this purely {{theoretical}} concept, Italian scientists Lucia Galli and Lamberto Maffei used animal {{models to}} observe electrical activity in ganglion {{cells of the}} retina. Before Falli and Maffei, retinal ganglion cell activity had never been recorded during prenatal development. To study ganglion activity, Falli and Maffei used premature rat retinas, between embryonic day 17 and 21, to record electrical activity. Several isolated, single cells were <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> The recordings showed cell activity was catalyzed from ganglion cells. Galli and Maffei speculated that the electrical activity seen in the retinal ganglion cells {{may be responsible for}} the formation of retinal synaptic connections and for the projections of retinal ganglion cells to the superior colliculus and LGN.|$|E

The proper choice of the emission source, allows a more correct assessment of the concentration of pollutants and their characteristics, always harmful to human health.

5000|$|It is {{not known}} yet how {{frequently}} the gene needs to be injected to maintain trichromacy among congenitally colorblind individuals. At the time of publication, Mancuso et al. reports that the treated squirrel monkeys have maintained 2 years of color vision after the treatment. [...] If repeat injections are needed, {{there is also the}} concern of the body developing an immune reaction to the virus. If a body develops sensitivity to the viral vector, the success of the therapy could be jeopardized and/or the body may respond unfavorably. An editorial by J. Bennett points to Mancuso et al.'s use of an [...] "unspecified postinjection corticosteroid therapy". [...] Bennett suggests that the monkeys may have experienced inflammation due to the injection. [...] However, the AAV virus that is commonly <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is non-pathogenic, and the body is less likely to develop an immune reaction. Needless to say, an extensive review of the safety of the treatment must precede any human trials.|$|E

30|$|Limitations exist {{with our}} data and our analyses. The data were {{obtained}} from the provincial dataset of hospitalizations, for which data collection may not be precise because of human error and because the data were collected for purposes other than <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> As well, observational studies cannot indicate causation. Each of our predictor variables was independently associated with injury risk and each would be correlated with each other. Multiple regression analysis, when finding the most efficient and compact model, eliminates closely correlated variables; therefore, some variables may be eliminated in favour of others which could be functionally important to understanding causation for the research questions under study.|$|R

30|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{research}} study was to evaluate the lubricity among water-based mud, oil-based mud, water-based mud with glass beads, and water-based mud with polymer beads in high-temperature conditions. The temperature <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was from 60 to 180  °C. The equipment <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was Lubricity Evaluation Monitor (LEM- 4100). The pump rate and bob speed were kept constant at 850 and 250  rpm, respectively. Pump speed represents the rate of mud flow into wellbore through nozzle on a drill bit while bob rotation represents drill bit rotation in a wellbore.
