5|$|Much of Traherne's work remains <b>un{{published}}.</b> He was {{not known}} during his lifetime, and only one of his works was published {{before his death in}} 1674 and two others were published shortly thereafter. Of his published work, almost all appeared posthumously, and most of it in the 20th century. Several <b>unpublished</b> manuscripts are held in museums, private collections and university archives, including the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford, the British Library in London and the Beinecke Library at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.|$|E

5|$|The last review {{he wrote}} {{was for the}} film To the Wonder, which he gave 3.5 out of 4 stars in a review for the Chicago Sun-Times. It was {{published}} on April 6, 2013. In July 2013, a previously <b>unpublished</b> review of the film Computer Chess appeared on Ebert's website. The review had been written in March but had remained <b>unpublished</b> until the film's wide-release date. Matt Zoller Seitz, the editor for Ebert's website, confirmed {{that there were other}} <b>unpublished</b> reviews that would be eventually uploaded to the website. A second posthumously published review, for The Spectacular Now, was published in August 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the University of California {{established}} the Ina Coolbrith Memorial Poetry Prize, given annually to {{authors of the}} best <b>unpublished</b> poems written by undergraduate students enrolled at the University of the Pacific, Mills College, Stanford University, Santa Clara University, Saint Mary's College of California, and any of the University of California campuses.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Bélier Press {{published}} The Complete Fritz the Cat, {{which brought}} {{together all the}} published stories featuring Fritz, as well as previously <b>unpublished</b> drawings and unfinished comics. At the artist's request, a 10-page story drawn in 1964 and previously published in R. Crumb's Comics and Stories (Rip Off Press) in 1969 was excluded from this collection. In April 1993, Fantagraphics Books published The Life & Death of Fritz the Cat, compiling nine major strips, including the 1964 story previously excluded from The Complete Fritz the Cat. Fritz the Cat strips also appear in The Complete Crumb Comics series. An <b>unpublished</b> page featuring Fritz that had been intended for Help!, as well as comics featuring other characters related to the anthropomorphic universe of Fritz the Cat, appeared in The R. Crumb Coffee Table Art Book in 1998.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{previously}} <b>unpublished</b> 17th-century Dutch illustration of a dodo went {{for sale at}} Christie's and was expected to sell for £6,000. It is unknown whether the illustration {{was based on a}} specimen or on a previous image. It sold for £44,450.|$|E

5|$|In {{advance of}} the court case, a female Scientologist was found {{collecting}} seven copies of the <b>unpublished</b> proofs from a copy shop in East Grinstead, near the Church of Scientology's UK headquarters at Saint Hill Manor.

5|$|The Drapier's last letter, An Humble Address to Both Houses of Parliament, was {{completed}} in June 1725. It was written before Wood's patent was defeated, and it was stopped from being printed when word reached Swift that the patent had been withdrawn. This letter remained <b>unpublished</b> for 10years.|$|E
5|$|The last opus {{number that}} Chopin himself used was 65, {{allocated}} to the Cello Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his <b>unpublished</b> manuscripts be destroyed. At {{the request of the}} composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 <b>unpublished</b> piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66–73), published in 1855. In 1857, 17 Polish songs that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.|$|E
5|$|A {{new edition}} was planned {{beginning}} in 1914 by Walther von Dyck (1856–1934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts {{to convince the}} Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction. These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler {{that had not been}} available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler's <b>unpublished</b> manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher {{published}} {{a series of}} works based on his father's extensive notes and <b>unpublished</b> manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings.|$|E
5|$|Albertosaurus is {{a member}} of the {{theropod}} family Tyrannosauridae, in the subfamily Albertosaurinae. Its closest relative is the slightly older Gorgosaurus libratus (sometimes called Albertosaurus libratus; see below). These two species are the only described albertosaurines; other undescribed species may exist. Thomas Holtz found Appalachiosaurus to be an albertosaurine in 2004, but his more recent <b>unpublished</b> work locates it just outside Tyrannosauridae, in agreement with other authors.|$|E
5|$|An <b>unpublished</b> study {{conducted}} by Vernon Meidlinger-Chin in 2013 suggested that previous studies lacked focus on endocranial details. The {{study found that the}} Cryolophosaurus fossil has a nearly complete, undistorted cranial cavity which is complete enough to give an approximate shape and size of the living brain. The endocast features clarified the dissimilarity of the skull with those of Allosauroids and Coelurosaurs giving Cryolophosaurus a basal position in Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{occurred after}} Spielmann, Hunt, and Lucas published a 2006 paper mentioning that the holotype of Redondasuchus {{was not a}} left paramedian but a right one. In 2002, Martz came {{to the same conclusion}} in an <b>unpublished</b> thesis. He, along with Taylor, Wedel, and Naish, claimed that this was another form of plagiarism.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480 BC) {{recognized}} that some fossil shells were remains of shellfish, which he used to argue that what {{was at the time}} dry land was once under the sea. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), in an <b>unpublished</b> notebook, also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the remains of shellfish. However, in both cases, the fossils were complete remains of shellfish species that closely resembled living species, and were therefore easy to classify.|$|E
5|$|Authorities {{were amazed}} by the {{similarities}} between Cox's actual crimes and his <b>unpublished</b> manuscript, The Associates, which they found several years before Cox was arrested. The novel's protagonist is 5ft 7in (170cm), has brown hair and blue eyes. Cox is 5ft 6in (168cm), has brown hair and green eyes. Both the protagonist and Cox drove a silver Audi TT, illegally acquired Tampa real estate worth $2.7 million, were alumni of the University of South Florida, had an intense fear of Interpol, and formerly worked as insurance seller.|$|E
5|$|By 1975, Mandela {{had become}} a Class A prisoner, which allowed him greater numbers of visits and letters. He corresponded with anti-apartheid activists like Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Desmond Tutu. That year, he began his autobiography, which was smuggled to London, but {{remained}} <b>unpublished</b> at the time; prison authorities discovered several pages, and his LLB study privileges were revoked for four years. Instead, he devoted his spare time to gardening and reading until the authorities permitted him to resume his LLB degree studies in 1980.|$|E
