I develop a two-country new Keynesian general equilibrium model with housing and collateral constraints to explore this issue. Results show that in a monetary <b>union,</b> <b>consumption</b> reacts more strongly to monetary policy shocks in countries with high loan-to-value ratios (LTVs), a high pro-portion of borrowers or variable-rate mortgages.

40|$|Latvia has set {{a target}} to {{increase}} the gross final consumption of energy from renewable energy sources up to 40 % by 2020. To reach this ambitious objective increasing {{of the amount of}} energy produced from locally available biomass is a priority. In Latvia, as in European <b>Union,</b> <b>consumption</b> of wood and wood waste has increased during the last decade. At the same time, export of pellets and briquettes produced in Latvia is a growing trend, therefore production amounts depend greatly upon export market demand. In the light of a foreseeable increase of the global market of solid biofuels the same trend would be respected in Latvia. Consequently and in the light of an increase in energy consumption this would result in shortages of the substrate biomass for the production of compressed biomass. To cover the growing biomass demand for both domestic consumption and export, potential biomass sources from agricultural and industrial sectors have to be investigated. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} determine the availability of potential herbaceous biomass sources for production of compressed biofuels in Latvia. In order to reach this target the available amounts of herbaceous agricultural and industrial by-products in Latvia have been evaluated and their energy potential has been calculated. In addition, the current use of these materials is described and sustainability aspects of various applications of such materials are discussed. This study intends to provide the necessary background information to select the most suitable and convenient sources (in terms of availability and energy value) for the production of compressed mixed biomass fuels at laboratory conditions and the consecutive determination of quality and physical, mechanical, thermo-chemical and combustion properties of such fuels...|$|E

In the United States, strong financial incentives are guaranteed for biofuel manufacturers while in the European <b>Union,</b> biofuel <b>consumption</b> is mostly driven by blending mandates. In the case of Malaysia, the blend of palm oil based biodiesel into diesel in all government vehicles was implemented in February 2009 and it is expected to be implemented nationwide in the nearest time. This paper seeks to examine the effect of biodiesel blend mandate (B 5) on the Malaysian palm oil market. A system of equations of eight structural equations and four identities is estimated by two-stage least squares method using annual data for the period 1976 - 2011. The results suggest that biodiesel blend mandate (B 5) significantly affects domestic demand. Hence, our results support neutrality of palm oil commodity markets in Malaysia to direct effects of biodiesel blend mandate. Then, the elasticity of Malaysian palm oil domestic demand with respect to biodiesel blend mandate is obtained. Results suggest that biodiesel blend mandate has a positive effect on the Malaysian palm oil domestic demand. Thus, the implementation of blend mandate is important in explaining Malaysian palm oil domestic demand. This finding also could be important for marketing strategies such as differentiation of product from food base for fuel use. In terms of government policy, the blend mandate (B 5) should be implemented by the Malaysian government if the objective is to boost domestic consumption...|$|R

This work was aimed at mapping the quality of various juices from different botanical origins from instrumental taste, chemical marker and antioxidant capacity perspectives. It also characterized the individual phenolic composition of juices previously classified according to their antioxidant activity and total phenolic material level. RESULTS Overall, by using correlation analysis and chemometrics (HCA and PCA), data showed that total phenolics, specifically gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, anthocyanins, flavanols and flavonols, are the main contributors to the antioxidant activity. Elderberry and pomegranate juices presented the highest phenolic content and antioxidant activity.

Then we empirically explore how the various exchange rate regimes impact on bilateral trade, output co-movement and financial integration. Financial integration is measured by the degree of risk sharing reflected in consumption co-movement relative to output co-movement. We find that, while currency union has the greatest effect, the peg regime also significantly boosts trade. We also find that, while the peg regime contributes to both output and consumption co-movements, the currency <b>union</b> strengthens only <b>consumption</b> co-movement and possibly lowers output co-movement.

40|$|Buildings are {{responsible}} for 40 % of total European <b>Union</b> (EU) energy <b>consumption</b> [EU 2010]. In accordance with the Directive 2012 / 27 /EU on energy efficiency, EU Member States should adopt long-term strategies for refurbishment of residential and commercial buildings to improve thermal performance and to reduce, at the same time, CO 2 emissions. Under this framework, it arises the {{need to create a}} web platform for energy renovation of buildings – ERBmarket. This paper seeks to describe the main targets and features of the platform. The main goal of ERBmarket is to stimulate the market for energy renovation of buildings, joining owners and users of buildings (demand side) and specialized companies in this field (supply side) in one website. Furthermore, this platform should integrate a diagnosis tool developed using an expert system: from the building description, ERBmarket should be able to identify the major gaps in terms of energy performance, and the best solutions for each case. The intervention costs, the energy and economic savings, the reduction in CO 2 emissions and the investment payback period will always be presented. The implementation of a web platform for energy renovation of buildings following the general lines proposed in this paper requires substantial investment and {{will take a long time}} to be fully operational due to its complexity, thus a phased implementation for ERBmarket platform should be adopted. Moreover, the intervention of several experts in the fields of energy efficiency and rehabilitation of buildings, during the development process, will be essential.

40|$|Fish {{are one of}} {{the main}} food sources {{throughout}} the planet and, {{in some parts of the}} world, especially in developing countries they are the only source of animal protein of local residents. Since the beginning of human civilization, fish have been caught in fresh and salt waters. Despite the fact that global fish consumption has been constantly increasing and it currently accounts for almost 20 kg of fish per person per year, the situation in the Czech Republic has been changing only slowly. The Czech Republic is known for traditional fish production in pond aquaculture with long historical roots and is currently ranked 6 th within the European <b>Union.</b> However, fish <b>consumption</b> is generally one of the lowest in Europe. The annual consumption is only 5. 5 kg of fish per person per year, of which fish from domestic aquaculture amount to only 1 - 1. 5 kg. Despite the fact that fish consumption in the Czech Republic has been low in the long run, the interest of consumers has been shifting to more expensive and better quality food. They are commodities such as Atlantic salmon, tuna and crustaceans which lack typical characteristics of products from the Czech aquaculture, i. e. the characteristic taste, aroma and presence of muscle bones. These changes in consumer´s behaviour were recorded on the basis of a study focusing on the import of fishery and aquaculture products into the Czech Republic. One of the goals of this doctoral thesis were the applied results in the form of newly developed products using fish meat, less valuable parts of fish (tailpiece) and wastes from fish processing (skin, head). Due to the nature of these applied results, their registration was done in the form of utility models with the Industrial Property Office of the Czech Republic. One of the newly developed and successfully offered products on the market is carp pâté. It is made of machine-separated carp meat and contains 90 % of the meat in the product. In addition to the basic pâté, there are currently other four variants (with pepper, smoked fish, almonds and cranberries). From the above, it is clear that there are many possibilities and opportunities how to increase the consumption and use of fish from domestic aquaculture. When introducing new products from fish, which are bred in ponds, the marketing must also be used to promote their indisputable benefits. And this is mainly the fact that it is a healthy and quality domestic raw material from the Czech agriculture. The very high quality and minimal occurrence of foreign substances in products from the Czech aquaculture were confirmed by our study. In the framework of this thesis, the screening of various fishery and aquaculture products, commercially available within the Czech Republic, was carried out with regard to the occurrence of heavy metals. The results of this study showed a very good quality of these products with a low content of heavy metals. Measured values of these elements in products from the Czech aquaculture were well below the allowed limit and their consumption does not pose any health risks. Due to the nature of the obtained data, it is possible to process and publish this study in a popular-scientific form to the general public.

40|$|O presente trabalho teve como objetivo delinear cenários para o consumo de etanol utilizado como combustível em países identificados como fundamentais no desenvolvimento do mercado internacional de etanol, como é o caso dos Estados Unidos, Japão, União Européia e Brasil, considerando-se um horizonte até o ano de 2012, ano pelo qual os países ratificaram, pelo Protocolo de Quioto, o compromisso de reduzir a emissão de gases causadores do efeito estufa. Para cumprir tal objetivo, utilizou-se do modelo Box-Jenkins de séries temporais para se efetuar as projeções do consumo de gasolina nestes países, no caso da União Européia projetou-se o consumo da Alemanha, isoladamente, e do conjunto das quatro maiores economias européias: Alemanha, França, Itália e Reino Unido. Após a realização das projeções, utilizaram-se as metas de mistura de etanol, em processo de discussão nos países em questão, obtendo-se os cenários de consumo de etanol. No caso brasileiro, projetou-se o consumo de álcool anidro, misturado na gasolina, e o consumo de álcool hidratado. Para os Estados Unidos, construi-se três cenários alternativos: no primeiro estimou-se um consumo de aproximadamente 7, 2 bilhões de litros de etanol no ano de 2012; no segundo, um consumo de 12, 3 bilhões de litros; e, no terceiro, um consumo de 18, 9 bilhões de litros no ano de 2012. Nestes três cenários, os produtores americanos de milho teriam plena capacidade de suprir a oferta, mantendo-se o sistema de subsídios para os produtores domésticos e tarifas incidentes sobre a importação de etanol. O Japão foi o país desenvolvido analisado com maior potencial para se tornar um grande importador de etanol brasileiro. Caso a mistura compulsória de 3 % até 2007 e 10 % a partir de 2008 venha a ser efetivada, isto implicaria em uma grande expansão no consumo de etanol para cerca de 6, 5 bilhões de litros no ano de 2012. O montante de etanol consumido deve ser basicamente importado, devido à indisponibilidade do país em produzir etanol. Na União Européia, caso a Alemanha venha a adotar uma mistura de 2 % de etanol na gasolina, isto implicaria em consumo de aproximadamente 360, 5 milhões de litros no ano de 2012. Caso os quatro países europeus analisados adotem a mistura de 2 % de etanol na gasolina, o consumo seria da ordem de 1, 36 bilhões de litros no ano de 2012. Projetou-se, ainda, o consumo de álcool anidro e hidratado no Brasil. Apesar da potencialidade do mercado japonês e da possibilidade de exportar para a Alemanha, o mercado brasileiro {{continua}} sendo o maior mercado potencial para o setor sucroalcooleiro brasileiro. Caso o preço do álcool hidratado se mantenha competitivo em relação ao da gasolina, este mercado possui um grande potencial de crescimento, principalmente com a possibilidade de expansão da frota de carros bicombustíveis. Mantendo-se a trajetória de crescimento de 2002 e 2003, o consumo do álcool hidratado poderá atingir 17, 4 bilhões de litros em 2012. The present work {{aimed to}} delineate scenarios for ethanol consumption used as fuel in countries identified as fundamental {{for the growth}} of the international market of ethanol, such as the United States, Japan, European Union and Brazil, considering a horizon until the year of 2012, when the countries ratified, through the Kyoto Protocol, the commitment to reduce the emission of gases which cause the greenhouse effect. In order to do so, a Box-Jenkins model of time series was delineated and estimated to forecast the gasoline consumption in these countries. In the case of the European <b>Union</b> the <b>consumption</b> of Germany was first projected separately, and then the consumption of the group of the four biggest European economies: Germany, France, Italy and United Kingdom was also projected as a group. After figuring out the projected consumption levels, the goals of mixture of ethanol were used, along with the countries in question, establishing their own scenarios of ethanol consumption. In the Brazilian case, the consumption anhydrous alcohol, mixed with the gasoline, was projected separately from the hydrated alcohol consumption. For the United States, three alternative scenarios were projected: the first estimated a consumption of roughly 7. 2 billion liters of ethanol in the year of 2012; the second, a consumption of 12. 3 billion liters; and the third, a consumption of 18. 9 billion liters for the year of 2012. In these three scenarios, the American maize producers would have full capacity to supply the demand, considering that the existing subsidies for domestic producers and tariffs upon ethanol imports remain. The results showed that Japan was the developed country with greater potential to become a Brazilian importer of ethanol. In case the compulsory mixture of 3 % up to 2007 and 10 % until 2008 becomes effective, the consumption of ethanol would expand by 6. 5 billion liters in the year of 2012. The amount of ethanol consumed in Japan must basically be imported, since the country does not produce the fuel. In the European Union, considering that Germany adopts a mixture of 2 % of ethanol in the gasoline, a consumption of approximately 360. 5 million liters would result in 2012. In case the four European countries considered for the analysis adopt the mixture of 2 % of ethanol in the gasoline, the consumption would be about 1. 36 billion liters by 2012. The anhydrous and hydrated alcohol consumption was also projected for Brazil. Despite the potential of the Japanese market and the possibility to export to Germany, the Brazilian market continued to be the biggest potential market for the Brazilian sugar-ethanol sector. In case the price of the hydrated alcohol remains competitive compared to gasoline, it has a great potential of growth, mainly with the possibility of expansion of the fleet of flex fuel cars. If the growth rate that prevailed for 2002 and 2003 is sustained, the consumption of the hydrated alcohol is likely to reach 17. 4 billion liters by 2012...|$|R
