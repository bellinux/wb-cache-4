This document profiles the historical growth of the HTML User and Fellowship Programs since their inception in 1987. Growth of the HTML programs has been demonstrated {{by the number of}} institutions executing <b>user</b> <b>agreements</b> and by the number of days of instrument use (user days) since the HTML began operation. A total of 522 agreements (351 industry, 156 university,and 15 other federal agency) are now in effect (452 nonproprietary and 70 proprietary). This represents an increase of 75 <b>user</b> <b>agreements</b> since the last reporting period (for FY 1997). A state-by-state summary of the nonproprietary <b>user</b> <b>agreements</b> is given in Appendix A. Forty-six states are represented. During FY 1998, the HTML User Program evaluated 80 nonproprietary proposals (32 from industry, 45 from universities, and 3 from other government facilities) and several proprietary proposals. Appendix B provides a detailed breakdown of the nonproprietary proposals received during FY 1998. The HTML User Advisory Committee approved about 95 % of those proposals, sometimes after the prospective user revised the proposal based on comments from the committee. This annual report discusses activities in the individual user centers as well as plans for the future. It also gives statistics about users, proposals, and publications as well as summaries of the nonproprietary research projects active during 1998...|$|R

Objective of this audit was to determine whether <b>user</b> facility <b>agreements</b> were priced for full cost recovery, <b>user</b> facility <b>agreement</b> collections were properly deposited, and financial assistance provided to visiting researchers was allowable and reasonable. The audit found that DOE priced Technology Deployment Center/User Facility and designated <b>user</b> facility <b>agreements</b> in accordance with DOE policies. However, other <b>user</b> facility <b>agreements</b> were not always priced to ensure full cost recovery, and collections were not always properly deposited. At one designated user facility, visiting researchers were provided with financial and housing assistance that is questionable as being allowable...|$|R
