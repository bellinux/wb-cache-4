5000|$|... 4-Dimethylaminophenylpentazole is an <b>unstable,</b> <b>explosive</b> {{compound}} {{that contains the}} rare pentazole ring, which is composed of five nitrogen atoms. The electron donating effect of the 4-dimethylamino substituent on the phenyl ring makes this compound {{one of the more}} stable of the phenylpentazoles. At room temperature, its chemical half-life is only a few hours, although storage is possible at cryogenic temperatures. The compound was first prepared in 1956 along with other substituted phenylpentazoles. Studies have been conducted on various other derivatives, though necessarily limited by the instability of these compounds. Some more highly substituted derivatives, such as 2,6-dihydroxy-4-dimethylaminophenylpentazole, are slightly more stable but conversely, more difficult to make. Current research has focused on forming transition metal complexes of these pentazole derivatives, as the pentazole ring should be stabilised by bonding to the metal centre.|$|E

[...] "They are creating an <b>unstable,</b> <b>explosive</b> atmosphere among the population and are virtually inviting people to lynch us," [...] he told Forum 18 News Service. [...] The government has denied registration of his Church, [...] attacked its places of worship and launched a criminal case against him.

The rebels believe that Styles engineered the whole thing, and caused the century of war that followed. That was why they used Dalek-derived time travel technology to travel to the past, to kill Styles before he could destroy the peace conference. They used the tunnels because that is the only common location shared by the two time zones. The Doctor is sceptical, believing Styles to be stubborn but basically a good man. When the Doctor finds out that the rebels brought a bomb made of dalekanium with them, a powerful and <b>unstable</b> <b>explosive</b> that will affect even Dalek casings, he realises that the rebels are caught in a predestination paradox. They will cause the very explosion they went back in time to prevent, and create their own history.

50|$|When Bobby and Press {{arrive in}} Denduron, they change their {{clothing}} {{to fit the}} local customs, and find a bobsled, along with two spears and a dog whistle, left by an acolyte (a person native to a territory who aides the Travelers by leaving items such as clothing and means for transportation). Bobby and Press start their descent from the mountain, and they are attacked by twelve quigs (animals Saint Dane uses to patrol {{the gates of the}} flumes; the appearance of quigs vary among the territories). They manage to live through the situation by using the dog whistle and the spears, but the sled crashes, and Press is kidnapped by Bedoowan knights. Bobby is rescued by a Traveler warrior named Osa, a wise woman whose daughter, Loor, is disgusted by him for most of the book. They are acquainted with Alder, a Bedoowen knight who is the Traveler from Denduron in disguise. Bobby, Alder and Loor try to rescue Press from the Bedoowan castle, armed with a backpack full of tools brought from Bobby's home, Second Earth, to make the job of rescuing Uncle Press easier, despite the warning Press gave Bobby that territories are not to be mixed (through items or otherwise). During this time, Bobby realizes that the Bedoowan live a luxurious and lazy life, as they listen to music, relax on pillows, and eat, attended by the pallid, taciturn Novans. Also, technologically speaking, the Bedoowan are years ahead of the Milago with inventions and devices including dumbwaiters, running water, and artificial light. After rescuing Press, Bobby learns that bringing items from Second Earth {{turns out to be a}} mistake. While Bobby was sleeping in a mine ventilation shaft before the rescue attempt, a homely merchant of the Milago by the name of Figgis had stolen a flashlight from Bobby's bag. When Bobby, Loor, Alder, and the newly rescued Press return to the Milago village, they discover that Figgis, the native merchant, had been selling tak, an <b>unstable</b> <b>explosive</b> that is to be used as a weapon to free themselves from Bedoowan rule. The final component to build a weapon that will destroy the Bedoowan (and probably all of the Milago village, though the Milago are willing to take that risk) is the battery and the switch from the flashlight, which Bobby accidentally supplied. Their plan was to present the tak bomb to the Bedoowan during the transfer ceremony (where the Bedoowan receive the glaze), disguised as a rather large mine cart of glaze, and destroy the remaining Bedoowan with smaller amounts of tak.|$|E

Purification and water treatment plant are necessary facilities for the correct supply and conservation of hydraulic resources. Disinfection process is necessary in any water treatment system (cleanliness stages in the supply, final stage of treatment and purification or human consumption). Multiple disinfection techniques exist, being the chlorine one of the agents mainly used in its form of chlorine gas, hypochlorite, or chloramines. All these techniques, with its advantages and disadvantages, in many situations neither fulfill these criteria for water sustainable use and legislation. The chlorine dioxide, theoretically the best disinfectant that exists, was one of the agents less used for being an <b>unstable</b> <b>explosive</b> gas, with needs of in-situ generation, and low purity in the industrial applications. Nevertheless, its stabilization in water for less than 15 years, allows to overcome the above mentioned disadvantages. This makes dioxide chlorine an important agent to be consider due to its stability, disinfection power, competitive price and reduction of disadvantages vs other technologies.

40|$|A co-rotating bosonic field {{interacting}} with a spinning Kerr black hole can extract rotational energy and angular momentum from the hole. This intriguing phenomenon {{is known as}} superradiant scattering. As pointed out by Press and Teukolsky, the black-hole-field system can be made <b>unstable</b> (<b>explosive)</b> by placing a reflecting mirror around the black hole which prevents the extracted energy from escaping to infinity. This composed black-hole-mirror-field bomb has been studied extensively by many researchers. It is worth noting, however, that most former studies of the black-hole bomb phenomenon {{have focused on the}} specific case of confined scalar (spin- 0) fields. In the present study we explore the physical properties of the higher-spin (electromagnetic and gravitational) black-hole bombs. It is shown that this composed system is amenable to an analytic treatment in the physically interesting regime of rapidly-rotating black holes. In particular, we prove that the composed black-hole-mirror-field bomb is characterized by the unstable resonance frequency ω=mΩ_H+is· 2 π T_BH (here s and m are respectively the spin-parameter and the azimuthal harmonic index of the field, and Ω_H and T_BH are respectively the angular-velocity and the temperature of the rapidly-spinning black hole). Our results provide evidence that the higher-spin (electromagnetic and gravitational) black-hole-mirror bombs are much more explosive than the extensively studied scalar black-hole-mirror bomb. In particular, it is shown here that the instability growth rates which characterize the higher-spin black-hole bombs are two orders of magnitudes larger than the instability growth rate of the scalar black-hole bomb.

40|$|Objective: The {{efficacy}} of maximal strength training on unstable surfaces remains unclear. The aims {{of this study}} were therefore to 1) quantify maximal dynamic force during a push-up movement with and without instability, 2) investigate whether training under unstable conditions would decrease the deficit between unstable and stable maximal force and 3) compare strength adaptations in the shoulder complex between traditional strength training and unstable strength training. Methods: 29 physically active university students (23 males, 6 females) performed maximal dynamic force tests under stable (explosive push-up on force platform, MDFstable) and unilaterally <b>unstable</b> (<b>explosive</b> push-up in instrumented slings, MDFunstable) as well as stable (PUstable) and unstable (PUunstable) push-up to failure tests and 1 RM bench press. 19 of the subject were randomized to an unstable training group or a stable training group. The remaining 10 was recruited as non-training controls. The two training groups trained 2 days a week for 8 weeks using identical periodization of sets and repetitions. Testing was repeated after 8 weeks. Results: For all subjects, MDFunstable was 26 ± 15 % lower than MDFstable during preliminary testing (MDFunstable/MDFstable, ratio = 0. 75 ± 0. 21). Training under unstable conditions did not decrease the deficit between MDFunstable and MDFstable because both improved similarly, but a significant decrease in deficit between PUunstable and PUstable was observed (pre: PUunstable = 51 ± 17 % of MDFstable, post: PUunstable = 78 ± 16 % of MDFstable, p ≤ 0. 01). Both stable and unstable training induced similar improvement in MDFstable (unstable: 25 ± 20 %, stable: 27 ± 21 %), 1 RM bench press (unstable: 10 ± 7 %, stable: 13 ± 6 %) and PUstable (unstable: 27 ± 26 %, stable: 30 ± 31 %). However, the unstable training group increased significantly more than the stable group in MDFunstable and PUunstable (p ≤ 0. 05). Conclusion: Unilateral instability directly applied to the shoulder complex results in substantial (~ 25 %), but individually variable loss of maximal dynamic force during a dynamic, maximally explosive push-up movement. Strength training under unstable conditions did not reduce the deficit in force development between stable and unstable conditions.

40|$|This paper studies a {{continuous}} time dynamic {{system with a}} random persistence parameter. The exact discrete time representation is obtained and related to several discrete time random coefficient models currently in the literature. The model distinguishes various forms of <b>unstable</b> and <b>explosive</b> behaviour according to specific regions of the parameter space that open up the potential for testing these forms of extreme behaviour. A two-stage approach that employs realized volatility is proposed for the continuous system estimation, asymptotic theory is developed, and test statistics to identify the different forms of extreme sample path behaviour are proposed. Simulations show that the proposed estimators work well in empirically realistic settings and that the tests have good size and power properties in discriminating characteristics in the data that differ from typical unit root behaviour. The theory is extended to cover models where the random persistence parameter is endogenously determined. An empirical application based on daily real S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 index data over 1964 - 2015 reveals strong evidence against parameter constancy after early 1980, which strengthens after July 1997, leading to a long duration of what the model characterizes as extreme behaviour in real stock prices...|$|R

Instead of using different estimation methods depending on whether the data generating process has time dummy effects or not and whether it is stable, spatial cointegrated, or explosive, we propose a data transformation approach which may eliminate time dummy effects and <b>unstable</b> or <b>explosive</b> components. When T is relatively larger than n, which is the effective sample size for each period after the transformation, the estimators are p n T consistent and asymptotically centered normal; when T is asymptotically proportional to n, the estimators are p n T consistent and asymptotically normal, but the limit distribution may not be properly centered; when T is relatively smaller than n, the estimators are consistent with rate T and have a degenerate limit distribution. We also propose a bias correction for our estimators. We show that when T grows faster than n 1 = 3, the correction will asymptotically eliminate the bias and yield a centered con…dence interval. This approach has a unified bias correction procedure that can be applied to different DGPs where the process might be stable or not...|$|R
