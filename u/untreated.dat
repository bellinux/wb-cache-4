5|$|Broussais {{discovers that}} if acute {{gastritis}} is <b>untreated,</b> {{it can become}} chronic.|$|E
5|$|A fungal {{infection}} explains the symptoms observed in AD patients. The slow progression of AD fits with the chronic nature of some systemic {{fungal infection}}s, {{which can be}} asymptomatic and thus, unnoticed and <b>untreated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aberrations in {{prenatal}} {{development can}} result in various forms of thyroid dysgenesis which can cause congenital hypothyroidism, and if <b>untreated</b> {{this can lead to}} cretinism.|$|E
5|$|About 1.2billion {{people in}} {{developing}} nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in waterborne diseases in humans. Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump <b>untreated</b> sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. Downstream, the <b>untreated</b> water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India {{as well as other}} developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin {{has been}} proven to {{decrease}} the risk of premature births in women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis during early pregnancy to {{about a third of}} the risk of <b>untreated</b> women.|$|E
5|$|Players must eat, {{drink and}} sleep, to avoid starvation, {{dehydration}} and exhaustion; {{failure to do}} so confers a steady decrease in certain skills and eventually leads to death if <b>untreated.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the {{pollution}} seems to be <b>untreated</b> water from the Yangbajain Geothermal Field power station.|$|E
5|$|A {{complication}} seen in <b>untreated</b> Addison's {{disease and}} other types of primary adrenal insufficiency is the adrenal crisis, a medical emergency in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels result in hypovolemic shock and symptoms such as vomiting and fever. An adrenal crisis can progressively lead to stupor and coma. The management of adrenal crises includes the application of hydrocortisone injections.|$|E
5|$|Cataracts {{can affect}} any breed of dog {{and is the}} same {{condition}} as seen in humans. Here {{the lens of the}} eye hardens and is characterised by cloudiness in the eye. Cataracts will blur the dog's vision and can lead to permanent blindness if left <b>untreated.</b> While considered mainly a hereditary disease, it can also be caused by diabetes, old age, radiation, eye injury or exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Haphazard {{industrial}} planning, increased urbanisation, {{poverty and}} lack of competence of the municipal government are seen as the major reasons for high levels of waste pollution in major Nigerian cities. Some of the 'solutions' have been disastrous to the environment, resulting in <b>untreated</b> waste being dumped in places where it can pollute waterways and groundwater.|$|E
5|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is {{the most}} commonly transmitted sexually transmitted infection, affecting both men and women. While most infections are asymptomatic and are cleared by the immune system, some types of the virus cause genital warts, and other types, if <b>untreated,</b> cause various forms of cancer, including cervical cancer, and penile cancer. Genital warts and cervical cancer {{are the two most}} common problems resulting from HPV.|$|E
5|$|Human {{pollution}} {{has affected}} {{the behavior of the}} American white ibis via an increase in the concentrations of methylmercury, which is released into the environment from <b>untreated</b> waste. Exposure to methylmercury alters the hormone levels of American white ibis, affecting their mating and nesting behavior and leading to lower reproduction rates.|$|E
5|$|IIH {{does not}} {{normally}} affect life expectancy. The major complications from IIH arise from <b>untreated</b> or treatment-resistant papilledema. In various case series, the long-term risk of ones vision being significantly affected by IIH {{is reported to}} lie anywhere between 10 and 25%.|$|E
5|$|If left <b>untreated,</b> DPB {{progresses}} to bronchiectasis, an irreversible {{lung condition}} that involves {{enlargement of the}} bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the bronchiolar passages. Daily treatment of DPB with macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin eases symptoms and increases survival time, but the disease currently has no known cure. The eventual result of DPB can be respiratory failure and heart problems.|$|E
5|$|Intergem {{rocked the}} gem trade by {{marketing}} the Yogo as the world's only guaranteed <b>untreated</b> sapphire. By 1982, {{the practice of}} routinely heat treating gems had become {{a major issue in}} the industry. At the time, 95percent of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Thai traders had even purchased large quantities of naturally colorless Sri Lankan sapphires, known as geuda, and heated them to an artificial blue. A problem with the practice was that heated gems often fade over time, though trained gemologists can detect a heated gem with 95percent accuracy. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed <b>untreated</b> Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. In 1985 there was a movement in Pennsylvania to require disclosure that a gem had been treated. Intergem's strategy resulted in large numbers of gem professionals visiting Yogo Gulch.|$|E
5|$|Left <b>untreated,</b> Wilson's disease {{tends to}} become {{progressively}} worse and is eventually fatal. With {{early detection and}} treatment, most of those affected can live relatively normal lives. Liver and neurologic damage that occurs prior to treatment may improve, but it is often permanent.|$|E
5|$|Many postsecondary {{students}} have reported using Adderall for study purposes {{in different parts}} of the developed world. Among these students, some of the risk factors for misusing ADHD stimulants recreationally include: possessing deviant personality characteristics (i.e., exhibiting delinquent or deviant behavior), inadequate accommodation of special needs, basing one's self-worth on external validation, low self-efficacy, earning poor grades, and suffering from an <b>untreated</b> mental health disorder.|$|E
5|$|Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in {{the early}} stages of the disease and more slowly later. <b>Untreated,</b> {{individuals}} are expected to lose independent ambulation after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years. However, it is uncommon to find <b>untreated</b> people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use. In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years. However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is the best predictor of disease progression. The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol ester prodrug with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA), a biosynthetic {{precursor}} of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability. The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of {{an overdose of}} paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in <b>untreated</b> mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs <b>untreated</b> control group). The oral LD50 {{was found to be}} greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.|$|E
5|$|Surgical {{resection}} {{offers the}} only potential chance of cure in cholangiocarcinoma. For non-resectable cases, the 5-year survival rate is 0% where {{the disease is}} inoperable because distal lymph nodes show metastases, and less than 5% in general. Overall median duration of survival is less than 6 months in inoperable, <b>untreated,</b> otherwise healthy patients with tumors involving the liver {{by way of the}} intrahepatic bile ducts and hepatic portal vein.|$|E
5|$|The Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{has had a}} {{long history}} of water pollution, which can be attributed to residential development. While no raw sewage flows into the creek, the creek is contaminated by large quantities of urban runoff from impervious paved surfaces that collects toxins before pouring <b>untreated</b> into the creek. There are over four large storm drain outlets that pour directly into Sulphur Creek. Such <b>untreated</b> runoff has caused E. coli and Enterovirus to increasingly harm the creek and its remaining biodiversity. Channelization is also another factor, and standing water in the Sulphur Creek Reservoir has suffered eutrophication. The primary source of bacteria contamination is the largest tributary of Sulphur Creek, now mostly underground. The channel joins the creek not too far from its mouth. It has been proved that 87 percent of the Sulphur Creek mainstem is severely degraded.|$|E
5|$|The {{fatality}} rate highly {{depends on the}} severity of the bites and some other factors. Deaths can be exceptional and probably occur in less than 15% of all <b>untreated</b> cases (usually in 2–4 days from complications following blood volume deficit and a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy), although some reports show that severe envenomations have a 52% mortality rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{of these}} patients is grim with <b>untreated</b> patients having an extremely short survival. The severity of liver disease (as evidenced by the MELD score) {{has been shown to}} be a determinant of outcome. Some patients without cirrhosis develop HRS, with an incidence of about 20% seen in one study of ill patients with alcoholic hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Untreated</b> DPB {{leads to}} bronchiectasis, {{respiratory}} failure, and death. A journal report from 1983 indicated that <b>untreated</b> DPB had a five-year survival rate of 62.1%, while the 10-year survival rate was 33.2%. With erythromycin treatment, individuals with DPB {{now have a}} much longer life expectancy due to better management of symptoms, delay of progression, and prevention of associated infections like P.aeruginosa. The 10-year survival rate for treated DPB is about 90%. In DPB cases where treatment has resulted in significant improvement, which sometimes happens after about two years, treatment {{has been allowed to}} end for a while. However, individuals allowed to stop treatment during this time are closely monitored. As DPB has been proven to recur, erythromycin therapy must be promptly resumed once disease symptoms begin to reappear. In spite of the improved prognosis when treated, DPB currently has no known cure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Untreated</b> {{streptococcal pharyngitis}} usually {{resolves}} {{within a few}} days. Treatment with antibiotics shortens {{the duration of the}} acute illness by about 16hours. The primary reason for treatment with antibiotics is {{to reduce the risk of}} complications such as rheumatic fever and retropharyngeal abscesses; antibiotics are effective if given within 9 days of the onset of symptoms.|$|E
5|$|All {{octopuses}} are venomous, {{but only}} a few species pose a significant threat to humans. Blue-ringed octopuses in the genus Hapalochlaena, which live around Australia and New Guinea, bite humans only if severely provoked, but their venom kills 25% of human victims. Another tropical species, Octopus apollyon, causes severe inflammation that can last for over a month even if treated correctly, and the bite of Octopus rubescens can cause necrosis that lasts longer than one month if <b>untreated,</b> and headaches and weakness persisting for up to a week even if treated.|$|E
5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of {{blindness}} is Canine glaucoma. This {{is an increase in}} the pressure of the fluid in the eye which, if left <b>untreated,</b> can cause visual impairment and eventual loss of sight. The condition can be inherited (Primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and treatment may include surgery to remove the cataract.|$|E
5|$|From {{the mid-1970s}} {{sewerage}} was processed at a plant near the town, which also handles sewerage from nearby Hadspen. Treated waste-water from there is discharged into {{a tributary of}} the Liffey River. As of 2003 the reticulated water supply in the town was <b>untreated</b> and both were operated by the Meander Valley council. By 2011 Carrick's water was supplied from the Mount Leslie Water Treatment Plant. This plant was built in 1996 and supplies treated water from the Trevallyn Dam.|$|E
5|$|Having {{joined the}} Army as a boy, Large {{fought in the}} Korean War and was wounded and taken {{prisoner}} at the Battle of Imjin. He {{spent two years in}} a prisoner-of-war camp, where his injuries went <b>untreated</b> and he lost {{more than a third of}} his body weight. After his release and rehabilitation, he joined the Special Air Service (SAS) and went on to serve in various conflicts around the world, hunting communist guerrillas in Malaya, suppressing rebellions in Oman and Aden, and conducting deniable cross-border reconnaissance and raids during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{died from}} sepsis on 14 June 1922, at the ancestral {{home of his}} wife at Gorhambury, Hertfordshire, England. His obituarists {{ascribed}} this to an obscure form of blood poisoning brought on by gassing in the trenches during his war service. However, his ailments, including fatigue, heartdigestiveneurological disorders, appendicitis, cognitive problems, depression, anxiety — are today recognised as differential symptoms of malaria. Left <b>untreated</b> they sometimes lead to organ failure and death.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism, {{also called}} underactive thyroid or low thyroid, {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the endocrine {{system in which the}} thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. <b>Untreated</b> hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|If a {{woman is}} <b>untreated,</b> two years of {{breastfeeding}} results in an HIV/AIDS risk in her baby of about 17%. Treatment decreases this risk to 1 to 2% per year. Due to the increased risk of death without breastfeeding in many areas in the developing world, the World Health Organization recommends either: (1) the mother and baby being treated with antiretroviral medication while breastfeeding being continued (2) the provision of safe formula.|$|E
5|$|In December 1887, Woodford {{contracted}} septicaemia from an <b>untreated</b> foot injury. He died on 23 December. He {{is seen as}} {{a pioneer}} of the Authentic school of masonic research, applying proper historical methodology in place of carelessly repeated fable. He earnestly collected and studied early masonic manuscripts, writing the introduction for Hughan's published collection. He contributed greatly {{to an understanding of the}} enigmatic history of the York lodges in the eighteenth century. His lasting legacy may be seen in the continued activity and influence of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, and the rational approach to masonic history.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. <b>Untreated</b> PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{take time to}} develop, {{and as many as}} half of cases are asymptomatic at the initial presentation. The more severe the injury, the more quickly symptoms become apparent. In severe cases, symptoms may occur as quickly as three or fourhours after the trauma. Hypoxemia (low oxygen concentration in the arterial blood) typically becomes progressively worse over 24–48hours after injury. In general, pulmonary contusion tends to worsen slowly over a few days, but it may also cause rapid deterioration or death if <b>untreated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some fungi {{can cause}} serious {{diseases}} in humans, several {{of which may}} be fatal if <b>untreated.</b> These include aspergillosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, mycetomas, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Furthermore, persons with immuno-deficiencies are particularly susceptible to disease by genera such as Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptoccocus, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis. Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called dermatophytic and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as ringworm and athlete's foot. Fungal spores are also a cause of allergies, and fungi from different taxonomic groups can evoke allergic reactions.|$|E
