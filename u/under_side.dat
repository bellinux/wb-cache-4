25|$|On the <b>under</b> <b>side</b> of the {{aircraft}} there are three air brakes, two at the front and one at the rear. The front air brakes have an area of 0.76m², and a deflection angle of 35°. The rear air brake has an area of 0.46m² and a deflection angle of 40°. The rear air brake is blocked if the airplane carries an external fuel tank. Behind the air brakes are the bays for the main landing gear. On the <b>under</b> <b>side</b> of the airplane, just behind {{the trailing edge of}} the wing are attachment points for two JATO rockets. The front section of the fuselage ends at former #28. The rear section of the fuselage starts at former #28a and is removable for engine maintenance.|$|E
500|$|After the Restoration, the {{patterns}} became ever more fanciful and exuberant. [...] "It {{is an almost}} impossible task to describe the large leaves, since they bear no resemblance to anything natural, they are, however, rarely angular in outline, rejoicing rather in sweeping curves, and drooping points, curled over to display the <b>under</b> <b>side</b> of the leaf, a device that gave opening for much ingenuity in {{the arrangement of the}} stitches." ...|$|E
500|$|Kipling station, {{the western}} {{terminus}} of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth, is located near Kipling Avenue and Dundas Street West. After going east for , it meets the University segment of Line 1 at both [...] and St. George stations. It also meets the Yonge Street line at Yonge station. The route's eastern terminus {{is located at}} Kennedy station, {{which is also the}} southern terminus of Line 3 Scarborough. The line does not run under Bloor Street or Danforth Avenue, except at the Prince Edward Viaduct; otherwise it is offset to the north. In some areas, it runs under parks and parking lots behind the businesses {{on the north side of}} the street, while other sections run <b>under</b> <b>side</b> streets.|$|E

2500|$|The rood was {{sometimes}} of such dimensions as to require some support {{in addition to}} the gallery on which it rested. A carved beam was used from which a chain connected the rood itself. At Cullompton, Devon, such a beam still exists, and is carved with foliage; an open cresting ornaments the <b>under</b> <b>side</b> and two angels support the ends. This particular rood stood on a base of rocks, skulls and bones, carved out of two solid logs averaging 18 in. wide and 21 in. high, and together measuring [...] long; there are round holes along the top which were probably used for lights.|$|E
2500|$|The game box {{contents}} are {{a set of}} 40 gold-embossed red playing pieces, a set of 40 silver-embossed blue playing pieces, {{a glossy}} folding 15-1/2" [...] x 18-1/2" [...] rectangular cardboard playing board imprinted with a 10x10 grid of spaces, and instructions printed in English on the <b>under</b> <b>side</b> of the box top. [...] The early sets featured painted wood pieces, later sets colored plastic. [...] The pieces are small and roughly rectangular, 1" [...] tall x 3/4" [...] wide, and unweighted. More modern versions first introduced in Europe have cylindrical castle-shaped pieces. Some versions have a cardboard privacy screen to assist setup. [...] A few versions have wooden boxes or boards.|$|E
2500|$|The {{body length}} (excluding legs) of the mature female is , [...] for males. Legs are long in {{proportion}} to body. Females are shiny and black in color, with a red marking {{in the shape of}} an hourglass on the ventral (<b>under)</b> <b>side</b> of her very rounded abdomen. There is much variation in female size, particularly in egg-carrying (gravid) females. The abdomen of a gravid female can be more than [...] in diameter. Many female widows also have an orange or red patch just above the spinnerets {{on the top of the}} abdomen. Juveniles have a distinctly different appearance from the adults; the abdomen is grayish to black with white stripes running across it and is spotted with yellow and orange. Males are either purple, or closer to the appearance of the juveniles in color.|$|E

2500|$|That {{element of}} which, {{as we have}} seen, even the {{simplest}} feeling is a complex, I shall call Mind-stuff. A moving molecule of inorganic matter does not possess mind or consciousness but it possesses {{a small piece of}} mind-stuff. When molecules are so combined together as to form the film on the <b>under</b> <b>side</b> of a jelly-fish, the elements of mind-stuff which go along with them are so combined as to form the faint beginnings of Sentience. When the molecules are so combined as to form the brain and nervous system of a vertebrate, the corresponding elements of mind-stuff are so combined as to form some kind of consciousness; that is to say, changes in the complex which take {{place at the same time}} get so linked together that the repetition of one implies the repetition of the other. When matter takes the complex form of a living human brain, the corresponding mind-stuff takes the form of a human consciousness, having intelligence and volition.|$|E
2500|$|The head is {{as large}} as an {{ordinary}} flour barrel, and has {{the shape of a}} sea lion head. The neck, if the creature may be said to have a neck, is of the same diameter as the body. The mouth is on the <b>under</b> <b>side</b> of the head and is protected by two tentacle tubes about eight inches in diameter and about 30 feet long. These tubes resemble an elephant's trunk and obviously were used to clutch in a sucker like fashion any object within their reach. Another tube or tentacle of the same dimensions stands out {{on the top of the}} head. [...] Two others, one on each side, protrude from beyond the monster's neck, and extend fully 15 feet along the body and beyond the tail. The tail, which is separated and jagged with cutting points for several feet, is flanked with two more tentacles of the same dimensions as the others and 30 feet long. The eyes are under the back of the mouth instead of over it. This specimen is so badly cut up by sharks and sawfish that only the stumps of the tentacles remain, but pieces of them were found strewn for some distance on the beach, showing that the animal had a fierce battle with its foes before it was disabled and beached by the surf.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first known}} {{specimens}} of B.victoriae {{may have been}} seeds sent to England in the early 1830s. These seeds were distributed {{to a number of}} gardens, and by 1835 three gardens had successfully raised plants to flowering: the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, the garden of George Percy, 5th Duke of Northumberland, and that of Henry Berens of Sidcup. In that year, the second of these was painted by Sarah Drake, and included as Plate 1728 in Edwards's Botanical Register. In the accompanying text, John Lindley identified the plant as B.speciosa (Showy Banksia), but commented [...] "We found neither the whiteness of the <b>under</b> <b>side</b> of the leaves, nor the faintness of the veins, which are supposed to be characteristic of the species". Doubts were raised about the identity of the species in 1857, when Walter Hood Fitch painted B.victoriae based on a cut flower provided by David Moore of Glasnevin Botanical Garden. Fitch's painting appeared as Plate 4906 in Volume 82 of Curtis's Botanical Magazine, and was accompanied by the text: [...] "There can, I think, be no doubt of its being the same with the B.speciosa above quoted in the Bot. Reg., but not the B.speciosa of Br. and Hook., Bot. Mag. t. 3052; and equally certain does it appear to be the B.Victoriæ of Meisner." [...] Thus it was implied that 1835 plate was in fact B.victoriae, a suggestion that was supported by George Bentham in his treatment of the species in his 1870 Flora Australiensis.|$|E
