500|$|In February 2005, Griffin {{was asked}} {{to take part in}} a debate on {{multiculturalism}} at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. He was invited by the president of the students' debating society, who said [...] "We believe that the only way to get the truth of what the BNP are saying and to combat them is to do it in public in a debate." [...] The move was attacked by anti-racist groups, some of whom refused to participate in the discussion. [...] Griffin said [...] "I am coming <b>up</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was invited by the students at the university because they have a debate on an intelligent subject on which I have something to say. The people against it are the usual bunch of people who cannot win the argument and refuse to stand on a platform." [...] The society withdrew the invitation before the event was to take place.|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. {{purchased}} the film rights, intending Harold Becker to direct and Robert Shapiro to produce. Tom Stoppard {{wrote the first}} draft of the screenplay, on which Ballard briefly collaborated. Becker dropped out, and David Lean came to direct with Spielberg as producer. Lean explained, [...] "I worked on it for about a year and in the end I gave it <b>up</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> thought it was too similar to a diary. It was well-written and interesting, but I gave it to Steve." [...] Spielberg felt [...] "from the moment I read J. G. Ballard's novel I secretly wanted to direct myself." [...] Spielberg found the project to be very personal. As a child, his favorite film was Lean's The Bridge on the River Kwai, which similarly takes place in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Spielberg's fascination with World War II and the aircraft of that era was stimulated by his father's stories of his experience as a radio operator on North American B-25 Mitchell bombers in the China-Burma Theater. Spielberg hired Menno Meyjes to do an uncredited rewrite before Stoppard was brought back to write the shooting script.|$|E
2500|$|Sainath toured ten drought-stricken {{states in}} India, about which he recalled: [...] "That's when I learned that {{conventional}} journalism was above {{all about the}} service of power. You always give the last word to authority. I {{got a couple of}} prizes which I didn't pick <b>up</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was ashamed." ...|$|E
5000|$|On his poetry, Sorescu said, with {{characteristic}} irony: [...] "Just as I can't give <b>up</b> smoking <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't smoke, I can't give <b>up</b> writing <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have no talent." [...] He often claimed {{a sense of}} alienation, saying [...] "the spoken word is a crossed frontier. By the act of saying something, I fail to say many other things." [...] On censorship, he said, after his last, post-1989 Revolution volumes were delayed, [...] "we have won our freedom, so I mustn't complain. O censors, where are you now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Beaton {{rested his}} elbow {{on the corner}} of the piano and gazed dreamily at her. [...] "Your {{perceptions}} are wonderful. It is disrespectful. I played it, <b>up</b> there, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> felt disrespectful to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Flory, you are {{pretending to}} be asleep." [...] Flory uttered a short snore,--or rather snort, for {{he was not a}} good actor. [...] "You may as well wake <b>up,</b> <b>because</b> {{otherwise}} <b>I</b> shall shake you." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{one point}} Vine was [...] "on {{the verge of}} giving <b>up</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wasn't making any money." [...] She had not paid any {{business}} rates on the gallery for a year, and was expecting the arrival of bailiffs. The proceeds of Charles Saatchi's 2004 purchase of Vine's painting Hi Paul Can You Come Over went to the council bailiff. Islington London Borough Council gave Rosy Wilde an additional month's grace to pay the outstanding debts after they {{had heard of the}} Saatchi's purchase. Vine was [...] "bombarded" [...] with phone calls from galleries wanting to show her work and from art collectors seeking {{to cash in on the}} [...] "Saatchi effect"; within a week she had sold six paintings. Saatchi also bought more work from her. Vine said, [...] "I can paint and pay the bills. I don’t need any more than that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2011, Minneapolis based {{record label}} Doomtree {{released}} {{an album of}} mash-ups between Fugazi and east coast veteran rap crew the Wu-Tang Clan. The album is titled 13 Chambers, group name Wugazi. However, Fugazi itself {{did not have any}} involvement with the release. Bassist Joe Lally was asked about his thoughts on the Wugazi release, and stated [...] "I think they could've found better Fugazi pieces to sample with Wu-Tang guys rapping on it. I mean, it’s enjoyable, and I do appreciate it for the fact that somebody enjoys our music enough to bring it into that. But, you know, I don’t know. I guess I should shut <b>up,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> suppose I'm about to run into these people at the Fun Fun Fun Fest festival and talk to them. But I’m afraid that is my opinion on it. It's like, get better samples of our stuff, do better work." ...|$|E
2500|$|August {{would also}} be a tough month for the other Rangers ace Cliff Lee, whose record for the month was 1–6. Lee was also accused by ESPN radio host Colin Cowherd {{claiming}} people close to Lee said he wanted to sign with the Yankees or another elite team, that Lee didn't care about Texas, and Cowherd also accused Lee of mailing it in against Baltimore on August 21, a game in which Lee gave up 8 runs. After the August 22 game Lee told reporters [...] "It's a lie. Write that. Are you writing? Write that it's a lie. I did not say that and nobody close to me would say that. Either say who the source is or shut <b>up</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am saying it is not true." [...] Following the events in Baltimore Lee would lose his next two games before reporting that he was having muscle pain in his back and would receive an injection.|$|E

6000|$|... "Come {{outside with}} me," [...] she said. [...] "I am shut <b>up</b> here <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{will not see}} the doctors whom they send, or any one from the Opera House. An envoy from the Palace has been and I have sent him away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure you {{can have}} it," [...] {{answered}} the stable man. [...] "As that fellow is a thief, {{you might as well}} tear that picture <b>up</b> afterward, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't want to be in no photograph with a criminal," [...] and he grinned sheepishly.|$|R
2500|$|On June 2, 1976, {{the eve of}} {{the first}} test match of the series, England captain Tony Greig was {{interview}}ed on BBC’s midweek sports program Sportsnight. The interview was conducted on the roof of Hove’s Pavilion in Sussex. In the interview, Greig was forced to respond to questions concerning England’s chances of winning the series against the young West Indies' side. Greig described being unimpressed by the West Indian squad. He described the West Indies recent humiliating defeat in Australia and their tumultuous home series against India. Greig explained, [...] "I like to think that people are building these West Indians <b>up,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am not really sure they’re as good as everyone thinks they are.” He then notoriously claimed, “Sure, they’ve got a couple of fast bowlers, but… you must remember that (if) the West Indian get on top they are magnificent cricketers, but if they’re down, they grovel. And I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.” The insensitive comments only inflamed the racial and colonial implications surrounding the 1976 series. The remark was particularly provocative coming from Greig, the white South African captain of England.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson {{presented}} [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] {{in a short}} {{live acoustic}} performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on March 2, 2015, and explained how she co-wrote the song. She revealed that the song's lyrical content had also made it {{hard for her to}} perform it live, saying [...] "It's not even the sad parts of it because I'm not there. I'm not in that place anymore, like where I'm sad about it. I'm in a very forgiving place about it and everybody's human. But I think I get really choked <b>up</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> just realize how lucky I am... And a lot of girls that grew up with their daddy issues and with not having that figure in their life, you know, take a very different road, and I just feel lucky that I'm not that girl." [...] To promote the album, Clarkson had also performed the song in a stripped-down performance as part of her set list during her Piece by Piece Tour. On February 25, 2016, she performed [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] in a live performance a year after its release on the fifteenth season of American Idol. Her rendition of the song was met with a standing ovation from the audience and critical acclaim from music critics— with Olivia Waring Metro praising it as poignant while USA Todays Erin Jensen describing it as a [...] "heartfelt performance that we just can't get enough of". On March 3, 2016, Clarkson appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show where she discussed her American Idol performance and closed the program with a rendition of the song.|$|E

5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} lyrics Ghostface wrote while in Africa was [...] "Nutmeg", a song with a rhythmic, off-beat cadence. Regarding the songs form, he stated [...] "Thats a wild song.

5000|$|Both studios offered Taylor a contract; {{while she}} would have {{preferred}} MGM, her mother decided to accept Universal's offer. Taylor began her contract in April 1941, and was soon cast in a small role in There's One Born Every Minute (1942). It was not followed by other roles, reportedly because the studio's casting director disliked her, stating that [...] "the kid has nothing ... her eyes are too old, she doesn't have {{the face of a}} child". Biographer Alexander Walker agrees that Taylor looked different from the child stars of the era, such as Shirley Temple and Judy Garland, and she herself later explained that [...] "apparently I used to frighten grown <b>ups,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was totally direct." [...] Universal terminated her contract in March 1942.|$|R

5000|$|Chess writer Leonard Barden {{has said}} that she could rival Judit Polgár as the best ever female player.

6000|$|... "There wasn't {{any other}} way to do it, and so I did it this way," [...] he said.
