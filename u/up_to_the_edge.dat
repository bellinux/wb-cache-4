5|$|The Marquesses of Bute {{acquired}} the castle in 1776. John Stuart, the first marquess, {{took steps to}} protect the ruins. His great-grandson John Crichton-Stuart, the third marquess, was immensely rich {{as the result of}} the family's holdings in the South Wales coalfields and was passionately interested in the medieval period. He had the site fully surveyed by the architect William Frame, and reroofed the great hall in the 1870s. The marquess began a process of buying back leasehold properties around the castle with the intent of clearing back the town houses that had been built <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the site.|$|E
5|$|The two armies {{stayed in}} their {{respective}} locations for two days. During the second day (August 1) Hannibal, aware that Varro would be in command the following day, left his camp and offered battle, but Paullus refused. When his request was rejected, Hannibal, recognizing the importance {{of water from the}} Aufidus to the Roman troops, sent his cavalry to the smaller Roman camp to harass water-bearing soldiers that were found outside the camp fortifications. According to Polybius, Hannibal's cavalry boldly rode <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the Roman encampment, causing havoc and thoroughly disrupting the supply of water to the Roman camp.|$|E
5|$|Chambers and {{his second}} in command, Captain Charles Spragg, {{immediately}} set about constructing a defensive trench across the post, and strengthening its other defences. But by now the Turks, from the 72nd Infantry Regiment, about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22:00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23:35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by the Turks. The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully {{and out of sight}} to the defenders, so they had to climb on the trench parapet to engage the Turks. This tactic worked well, and they broke up the Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. The Turks did not withdraw far, and crept <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the New Zealanders' trench during the night. They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position. At the same time, small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down.|$|E

500|$|In the Antarctic, {{killer whales}} range <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> {{of the pack}} ice and are {{believed}} to venture into the denser pack ice, finding open leads much like beluga whales in the Arctic. However, killer whales are merely seasonal visitors to Arctic waters, and do not approach the pack ice in the summer. With the rapid Arctic sea ice decline in the Hudson Strait, their range now extends deep into the northwest Atlantic. Occasionally, killer whales swim into freshwater rivers. They have been documented [...] up the Columbia River in the United States. They have also {{been found in the}} Fraser River in Canada and the Horikawa River in Japan.|$|E
500|$|Announcing that {{a primary}} for 1892, {{as had been}} {{prescribed}} two years before, was anti-reform, Tillman put off the first Democratic gubernatorial primary in the state until 1894. Thus, the nominee would be chosen by a convention, and the summer of 1892 saw a lengthy series of debates between Tillman and his challenger, former governor John C. Sheppard. The bitter campaign was marked by violence, often set off by provocative language from the candidates. According to Kantrowitz, Tillman [...] "sought to prolong the confrontation, to take the crowd <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of violence, demonstrating his identification with his farmers without quite provoking them to murder". When former senator Hampton attempted to speak on Sheppard's behalf, he was shouted down by Tillman partisans; opponents complained that Tillman's supporters had formed a mob, and that the governor was a true son of violent Edgefield.|$|E

2500|$|As a result, Sumer and Akkad had {{a surplus}} of {{agricultural}} products but was short of almost everything else, particularly metal ores, timber and building stone, all of which had to be imported. The spread of the Akkadian state as far as the [...] "silver mountain" [...] (possibly the Taurus Mountains), the [...] "cedars" [...] of Lebanon, and the copper deposits of Magan, was largely motivated by the goal of securing control over these imports. One tablet reads [...] "Sargon, the king of Kish, triumphed in thirty-four battles (over the cities) <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the sea (and) destroyed their walls. He made the ships from Meluhha, the ships from Magan (and) the ships from Dilmun tie up alongside the quay of Agade.

2500|$|On the 5th Bavarian Division front the {{bombardment}} increased on 14 September, causing many casualties, cutting most telephone lines and destroying the front trenches until an overnight lull. The bombardment resumed {{early in the}} morning including gas shells and before dawn a thick mist rose, which with the gas and smoke, reduced visibility and around [...] troops of Bavarian Infantry Regiment 21 (BIR 21) near Ginchy were surprised to see three vehicles emerge from the mist, manoeuvring round shell-craters. The vehicles, with blue-and-white crosses, were thought to be for transporting wounded. Machine-gun fire was received from them and the Bavarians returned fire but the vehicles drove <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the trench and fired along it for several minutes. The vehicles drove away, one being hit by a shell and abandoned in no man's land. Soon afterwards a creeping barrage began to move towards the German defences and the German artillery reply was considered by survivors to be feeble. A wounded officer returning for treatment found that the batteries around Flers and Gueuedecourt did not know that the British were attacking because the telephone lines had been cut and visual signals had not been seen in the smoke and mist.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 July, the 30th Division {{attacked}} again, {{through the}} positions of the 35th Division again at [...] as the French Sixth Army attacked on the right. The 89th Brigade attacked Falfemont Farm and the second position, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of Guillemont, which was attacked by the 90th Brigade. Guillemont station and trenches to the north-west were attacked by the 5th Brigade of the 2nd Division. As the troops moved up during the night of 29 July, a German bombardment fell around Trônes Wood and caught troops from the 89th and 90th brigades. At dawn, fog rose and visibility fell below Maltz Horn Farm and trenches nearby, were stormed at zero hour, by a British battalion from the west and part of the French 153rd Division from the south. The British advanced to the Hardecourt–Guillemont road, despite many losses and dug in with reinforcements, which had moved forwards in small columns. No French troops could be seen and few of the left-hand battalion reached the road, although a larger party reached an orchard at the south-east edge of Guillemont. On the left, the 90th Brigade advanced either side of the Trônes Wood–Guillemont track, got into the village with few losses and took [...] After a pause, the creeping barrage moved on and the north-east of the village was occupied, touch being gained with the left-hand battalion and a counter-attack repulsed. The left-hand battalion had advanced south of the railway and taken many prisoners at the German front trench, before being stopped by crossfire from the quarry to the south and the station to the north. Another attempt to advance and an effort to form a defensive flank along the railway facing north failed, due to uncut wire and machine-gun fire from the flank, which forced a withdrawal.|$|E
