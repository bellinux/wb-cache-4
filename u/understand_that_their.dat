5|$|Caprica-Six and Boomer {{are next}} shown conversing with Number Three. While the three move up a stairwell, {{explosives}} {{set by the}} resistance led by Samuel T. Anders (Michael Trucco) detonate, trapping Anders, Three, Boomer, and Caprica-Six in a parking garage. While Anders is originally shielded and hidden by the blast, Caprica-Six breaks her leg. Number Three offers to euthanize her, but Caprica-Six refuses as she suspects that Number Three will {{take the opportunity to}} box her. Shortly afterwards, the three find Anders who Number Three intends to kill before being stopped by Boomer and Caprica-Six. As Number Three goads them, Boomer and Caprica-Six <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> unique view of humanity through their love for Baltar and Galen Tyrol gives them a perspective that makes them a threat to the Cylon status-quo. When Number Three attempts to kill Anders, she is killed by Caprica-Six who, along with Boomer, allow Anders to escape. Recognizing that it will take some time for Number Three to resurrect and report them, Caprica-Six and Boomer form a pact to change the Cylon perspective of humanity together before finally being rescued from the collapsed parking garage by the other Cylons.|$|E
25|$|People with OCD <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> notions do not {{correspond}} with reality; however, {{they feel that}} they must act as though their notions are correct. For example, an individual who engages in compulsive hoarding might be inclined to treat inorganic matter as if it had the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level. There is a debate {{as to whether or not}} hoarding should be considered with other OCD symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Goodness, he believed, came {{more from}} {{practice}} and discipline than from innate human nature. He believed {{that one should}} distance oneself from the wicked, stating that such association increases disposition to vice. Anger, while difficult to control, must be mastered in order for one to be rational. Those who take pleasure from the disasters of their neighbors fail to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> fortunes {{are tied to the}} society in which they live, and they rob themselves of any joy of their own. Democritus believed that happiness was a property of the soul. He advocated a life of contentment with as little grief as possible, which he said could not be achieved through either idleness or preoccupation with worldly pleasures. Contentment would be gained, he said, through moderation and a measured life; to be content one must set their judgment on the possible and be satisfied with what one has—giving little thought to envy or admiration. Democritus approved of extravagance on occasion, as he held that feasts and celebrations were necessary for joy and relaxation. He considers education to be the noblest of pursuits, but cautioned that learning without sense leads to error.|$|E

500|$|Frank {{frequently}} {{wrote of}} her difficult {{relationship with her}} mother, and of her ambivalence towards her. On 7 November 1942 she described her [...] "contempt" [...] for {{her mother and her}} inability to [...] "confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm and her hard-heartedness," [...] before concluding, [...] "She's not a mother to me." [...] Later, as she revised her diary, Frank felt ashamed of her harsh attitude, writing: [...] "Anne, is it really you who mentioned hate, oh Anne, how could you?" [...] She came to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> differences resulted from misunderstandings that were as much her fault as her mother's, and saw that she had added unnecessarily to her mother's suffering. With this realization, Frank began to treat her mother with a degree of tolerance and respect.|$|E
500|$|Opus Dei {{was founded}} by a Catholic priest, Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer, on 2 October 1928 in Madrid, Spain. According to Escrivá, on that day he {{experienced}} a vision in which he [...] "saw Opus Dei". He gave the organization the name [...] "Opus Dei", which in Latin means [...] "Work of God", in order to underscore {{the belief that the}} organization was not his (Escrivá's) work, but was rather God's work. Throughout his life, Escrivá held that the founding of Opus Dei had a supernatural character. Escrivá summarized Opus Dei's mission as a way of helping ordinary Christians [...] "to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> life... is a way of holiness and evangelization... And to those who grasp this ideal of holiness, the Work offers the spiritual assistance and training they need to put it into practice." ...|$|E

500|$|From a {{historical}} NBA perspective, the rivalry between Chamberlain and his perennial nemesis Bill Russell is {{cited as the}} greatest on-court rivalry of all time. There were three NBA Finals matchups in the rivalry between Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, but they played different positions and did not guard each other. Russell's Celtics won seven of eight playoff series against Chamberlain's Warriors, 76ers, and Lakers teams, and went 57–37 against them {{in the regular season}} and 29–20 in the playoffs. Russell's teams won all four seventh games against Chamberlain's—the combined margin was nine points. Chamberlain outscored Russell 30 to 14.2 per game and outrebounded him 28.2 to 22.9 in the regular season, and also in the playoffs, he outscored him 25.7 to 14.9 and outrebounded him 28 to 24.7. The comparison between the two is often simplified to a great player (Chamberlain) versus a player who makes his team great (Russell), an individualist against a team player. In [...] when Chamberlain averaged 50.4 points per game, he noted that Boston did not rely on Russell's scoring, and he could concentrate on defense and rebounding. He wished people would <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> roles were different. Chamberlain said, [...] "I've got to hit forty points or so, or this team is in trouble. I must score—understand? After that I play defense and get the ball off the boards. I try to do them all, best I can, but scoring comes first." [...] Russell won 11 NBA titles in his career while Chamberlain won two. Chamberlain was named All-NBA first team seven times to Russell's three, but Russell was named league MVP—then selected by players and not the press—five times against Chamberlain's four. Russell and Chamberlain were friends in private life. Russell never considered Chamberlain his rival and disliked the term, instead pointing out that they rarely talked about basketball when they were alone. When Chamberlain died in 1999, Chamberlain's nephew stated that Russell was the second person he was ordered to break the news to. The two did not speak for two decades after Russell criticized Chamberlain after Game 7 of the 1969 Finals. Russell apologized privately to Chamberlain and later publicly.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{emerging}} pre-reader stage children will often [...] "read" [...] books and stories. They {{will tell the}} story as they have memorized it and turn the pages appropriately. They call {{what they are doing}} [...] "reading" [...] since they typically don't yet <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> parents or caregivers are decoding written words. To them, they are doing what they think their parents or caregivers are doing when reciting the story.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} {{settlement}} is a ‘Civilization-Jihadist Process’ {{with all the}} word means.

Some champion bucking horses got their start as spoiled riding horses that learned to quickly and effectively unseat riders.

[...] Awards are given to the owners of the best bucking horses, who are respected as equine athletes and perform for many years. Many are retired to pasture {{at the end of their}} careers. Many bucking horses understand their job well and reduce or stop their bucking, even while still wearing a flank strap, as soon as they either unseat the rider or hear the buzzer. [...] Likewise, some bulls appear to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> [...] "job" [...] is to throw the rider; they learned not to buck when in the chute and buck far less once the rider is thrown.|$|E

The way lay entirely through Mr. Poyser's own fields till they reached the main road leading to the village, and he turned a keen eye on the stock and the crops as they went along, while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a running commentary on them all.
