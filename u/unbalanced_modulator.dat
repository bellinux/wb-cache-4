40|$|This paper {{presents}} mathematical {{models with}} associated {{analysis of the}} deleterious effects which a spacecraft's subcarrier <b>unbalanced</b> <b>modulator</b> has {{on the performance of}} a phase-modulated residual carrier communications link. The undesired spectral components produced by the phase and amplitude imbalances in the subcarrier modulator can cause (1) potential interference to the carrier tracking and (2) degradation in the telemetry bit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A suitable model for the <b>unbalanced</b> <b>modulator</b> is developed and the threshold levels of undesired components that fall into the carrier tracking loop are determined. The distribution of the carrier phase error caused by the additive White Gaussian noise (AWGN) and undesired component at the residual RF carrier is derived for the limiting cases. Further, this paper analyses the telemetry bit signal-to-noise ratio degradations due to undesirable spectral components as well as the carrier tracking phase error induced by phase and amplitude imbalances. Numerical results which indicate the sensitivity of the carrier tracking loop and the telemetry symbol-error rate (SER) to various parameters of the models are also provided as a tool {{in the design of the}} subcarrier balanced modulator...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} the error performance of binary-phase-shift-keyed (BPSK) and QPSK signals generated from <b>unbalanced</b> <b>modulators</b> and tracked by the conventional Costas loop and a generalized Costas loop, respectively, with the e#ect of modulator unbalance on the steady-state lock points of these carrier tracking loops being taken into consideration. Also, a more generalized model that includes the possible phase deviation from the ideal 90 -deg separation between the in-phase and quadrature channels of QPSK is considered in this articl...|$|R
