40|$|To {{find a more}} {{effective}} method {{for the assessment of}} sustainable <b>urban</b> transport <b>development,</b> the comprehensive assessment model of sustainable <b>urban</b> transport <b>development</b> was established based on the unascertained measure. On the basis of considering the factors influencing <b>urban</b> transport <b>development,</b> the comprehensive assessment indexes were selected, including <b>urban</b> economical <b>development,</b> transport demand, environment quality and energy consumption, and the assessment system of sustainable <b>urban</b> transport <b>development</b> was proposed. In view of different influencing factors of <b>urban</b> transport <b>development,</b> the index weight was calculated through the entropy weight coefficient method. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted according to the actual condition. Then, the grade was obtained by using the credible degree recognition criterion from which the <b>urban</b> transport <b>development</b> level can be determined. Finally, a comprehensive assessment method for <b>urban</b> transport <b>development</b> was introduced. The application practice showed that the method can be used reasonably and effectively for the comprehensive assessment of <b>urban</b> transport <b>development...</b>|$|R

40|$|Since its {{economic}} reform and opening-up, China has undergone unprecedented urbanization, where massive areas of rural land have {{been converted into}} urban use. <b>Urban</b> land <b>development</b> {{plays an important role}} in dynamic <b>urban</b> economic <b>development.</b> This study aims to contribute to the understanding of <b>urban</b> land <b>development</b> and its mechanisms in China. We conceptualized the mechanism of <b>urban</b> land <b>development</b> from multiple perspectives based on a case study in Jiangsu Province. We employed the methods of global and local spatial auto-correlation detection and spatial lag model to analyze the provincial land use conveyance and survey data from 2004 to 2008 and 2009 to 2012 to understand the dynamics of <b>urban</b> land <b>development.</b> The results show that <b>urban</b> land <b>development</b> varies significantly across different time periods, spatial scales, and regions in Jiangsu. Higher absolute <b>urban</b> land <b>development</b> mainly occurred in Sunan, expanding to Subei and Suzhong, while faster development occurred mainly in Subei, where the initial bases were lower but had strong economic growth potential. The regression analysis shows that market activities and administrative levels had played a more critical role in driving <b>urban</b> land <b>development,</b> which suggests that rapid <b>urban</b> land <b>development</b> has institutional and market foundations. <b>Urban</b> land <b>development</b> was not only a consequence of economic development but also a strategy of local governments to stimulate and govern the urban economy. This study enriches the literature on urban dynamics by providing an institutional understanding of rapid <b>urban</b> land <b>development</b> in a transitional economy...|$|R
