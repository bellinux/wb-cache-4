Generally described as a military dictatorship, Noriega's rule in Panama was marked by repression of the media, {{an expansion of the}} military, and the persecution of political opponents, effectively controlling the outcomes of any elections. He was known for his complicated relationship with the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>being</b> described as being its ally and nemesis at the same time.

25|$|All {{evidence}} {{points to}} the <b>U.S.</b> <b>being</b> the primary destination of Israeli emigrants. In 1982, demographer Pini Herman estimated that there were 100,000 Israeli emigrants residing in the U.S., half of whom lived in the New York and New Jersey metropolitan area with another 10,000–12,000 living in the Los Angeles area. The relative stability of the New York component of this Israeli immigrant population was confirmed nearly three decades later in a 2009 study for the UJA Federation of New York by Steven M. Cohen and Judith Veinstein, which found that New York has 41,000 Israelis immigrants.|$|E

25|$|Political {{instability}} in the 20th century, coupled with bureaucratic regulations and high taxes tempered {{the growth of the}} Chilean wine industry. Prior to the 1980s, the vast majority of Chilean wine was considered low quality and mostly consumed domestically. As awareness of Chile's favorable growing conditions for viticulture increased so did foreign investment in Chilean wineries. This period saw many technical advances in winemaking as Chile earned a reputation for reasonably priced premium quality wines. Chile began to export extensively, becoming the third leading exporter, after France and Italy, into the United States {{by the turn of the}} 21st century. It has since dropped to fourth in the <b>US,</b> <b>being</b> surpassed by Australia, but focus has switched to developing exports in the world's other major wine markets like the United Kingdom and Japan.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Christopher P. Earley {{hypothesized}} that social loafing would be mitigated in collectivist cultures that {{focused more on}} achievement of the group than the individual. He conducted {{a study in the}} United States and China, two polar opposites in terms of culture (with the <b>U.S.</b> <b>being</b> individualistic and China being collectivist), in order to determine if a difference in social loafing was present between the two types of cultures. Earley formed groups from both countries similar in demographics and in time spent with each other (participants in each of the groups had known each other for three to five weeks). Each group was tasked with completing various forms of paperwork similar to work they would be required to do in their profession. The paperwork was designed to take two to five minutes for each item, and the items were turned in to an assistant when completed so that no one could judge their work compared to others. Each participant was given 60 minutes to complete as many items as possible and was separated into either the high-accountability group, where they were told they needed to achieve a group goal, or a low-accountability group, where they were told they were to achieve a goal alone. They were also separated into high and low shared responsibility groups.|$|E
25|$|Along with hostility {{between the}} North and the South, there was {{friction}} between Mexicans and whites. For example, in New Mexico there was active {{resistance to the}} United States in the Taos Revolt, resulting in {{the execution of the}} U.S. governor of New Mexico. New Mexico proved to be the safest place for Mexicans in the United States because there is strength in numbers. Texas and California were more dangerous places because Mexicans were not the majority, and not all whites appreciated their presence there. California was particularly profitable for the United States, so many Americans wanted to move to that area. For instance, gold was discovered in 1849, causing Euro-Americans to rush to California. These individuals were very hostile towards Mexicans. In California alone, over 302 lynchings occurred between 1849 and 1902. During those years there were at least 5,000 lynchings in the United States as a whole. Most people associate lynchings with blacks. With about 73% of lynchings that occurred in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>being</b> those of African Americans, this association is understandable. However, Mexicans were lynched as well, though it is not talked about as often. Not all resistance to Mexicans included violence, however. On April 13, 1850, the state legislature passed a $20 per month tax on non-American-born miners in California during the Gold Rush. The tax primarily targeted Latin Americans. Resistance to the Foreign Miners Tax came not only from Mexicans but also from French, Chilean, and German miners, along with merchants whose businesses suffered {{as a direct result of}} the tax.|$|E

500|$|Contrary to the accusations, {{the band}} have always denied {{the notion that}} they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the Live After Death concert video.

500|$|The more {{traditional}} American folk blues continued to provide 1960s British groups with material, particularly after {{the emergence of}} Bob Dylan, who also popularised folk blues songs. In 1964, for example, the song-catalogue of Huddie Ledbetter ("Leadbelly") provided The Animals with [...] "The House of the Rising Sun", Manfred Mann with [...] "John Hardy" [...] and The Four Pennies with [...] "Black Girl". British acoustic blues continued to develop {{as part of the}} folk scene. In the early 1960s, folk guitar pioneers Bert Jansch, John Renbourn and particularly Davy Graham, played blues, folk and jazz, developing a distinctive guitar style known as folk baroque. It continued with figures like Ian A. Anderson and his Country Blues Band, and Al Jones. Most British acoustic blues players could achieve little commercial success and found it difficult to gain recognition for their [...] "imitations" [...] of the blues in the <b>US,</b> <b>being</b> overshadowed by the rhythm and blues and electric blues that had emerged in the later 1950s.|$|E

Not long afterward, she indicated to a reporter that she was [...] "thinking of dropping out of women's competition altogether." ...|$|E

500|$|Karen is {{voiced by}} American actress Jill Talley, {{who is also}} the wife of SpongeBob's voice actor, Tom Kenny. Talley uses a Midwestern accent for the character.

500|$|The Livestock Conservancy has {{released}} three definitions of heritage breeds, pertaining to turkeys, chickens and cattle. Heritage turkeys {{are defined by}} the organization as breeds that live longer, grow slower and can mate naturally, with the latter requirement {{being one of the}} most important as it is not met by many industrially grown, mass-produced breeds. In 2009, a definition for heritage chickens was released that is similar to the one for turkeys– breeds are required to be considered [...] "standard" [...] by the American Poultry Association, be long-lived and slow-growing, and able to mate naturally. The latter is less of a concern in chickens than in turkeys, as artificial insemination has not progressed as far in the development of industrial chicken farming. In late 2010, the Conservancy released a definition of [...] "heritage cattle", to follow their earlier heritage turkey description. Requirements for heritage cattle breeds include having a long history in the <b>US,</b> <b>being</b> purebred, and being a true genetic breed. Specifications for heritage milk and beef, as well as products made from them, were also released with the definition.|$|E
