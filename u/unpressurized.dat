5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} the study and {{modelling}} of {{the transfer of the}} inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations in ambient pressure. In the case of underwater diving and compressed air work, this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressure—but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and occupants of <b>unpressurized</b> aircraft, are exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure. In all cases, the symptoms of decompression sickness occur during or within {{a relatively short period of}} hours, or occasionally days, after a significant reduction of ambient pressure.|$|E
5|$|The <b>unpressurized</b> {{rotodome}} is 30feet (9.1m) in diameter, {{six feet}} (1.8m) thick at the center, and is held 11feet (3.4m) above the fuselage by two struts. It is tilted {{down at the}} front to reduce its aerodynamic drag, which lessens its detrimental effect on take-offs and endurance (which is corrected electronically by both the radar and secondary surveillance radar antenna phase shifters). The rotodome uses bleed air, outside cooling doors, and fluorocarbon based cold plate cooling to maintain the electronic and mechanical equipment temperatures. The hydraulically rotated antenna system permits the Westinghouse Corporation's AN/APY-1 and AN/APY-2 passive electronically scanned array radar system to provide surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the stratosphere, over land or water.|$|E
5|$|One MiG-9 (izdeliye FK) was {{modified}} in 1949 {{to serve as}} a testbed for the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile. A second <b>unpressurized</b> cockpit was built in line with the trailing edge of the wing for the guidance system operator. The aircraft was fitted with two radars, a K-1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet-shaped fairing above the air intakes and an aft-looking radar mounted in a cigar-shaped fairing {{at the top of the}} vertical stabilizer. This latter system was intended to test the mid-course guidance system of the launching aircraft and the guidance systems of the missile. Signals from the K-1M radar were received in small bullet-shaped fairings on the leading edges of the wings. The aircraft served in this role for four years, until the missile passed its state acceptance trials in 1952–53.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the extra docking port caused {{the adoption of the}} Almaz-derived twin-chamber propulsion system first used on Salyut 3 and 5, with the two engine nozzleseach producing 2.9kilonewtons of thrustmounted peripherally {{on either side of the}} aft port. Salyut 6 introduced a Unified Propulsion System, with both the engines and the station's control thrusters running on unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, drawn from a common set of pressurized tanks, allowing the refueling capabilities of the visiting Progress tankers to be exploited to the maximum effect. The entire engine and fuel storage assembly was contained within an <b>unpressurized</b> bay at the rear of the station, which was the same diameter as the main pressurized compartment. However, the replacement of the Soyuz engine used on previous stations with the bay meant that the station kept a similar overall length to its predecessors. The main engines could not be fired if the rear docking port was in use, hence any orbital maneuvers during this time had to be performed by the visiting spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|Air Canada {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{airlines}} to have its entire fleet of <b>unpressurized</b> aircraft equipped with fixed oxygen systems for use by flight crew and passengers, using the rebreathing bag principle.|$|E
25|$|ELC-1 was {{installed}} on the <b>Unpressurized</b> Cargo Carrier Attachment System #2 (UCCAS 2) on the P3 (port side) segment of the main truss. ELC-2 {{was installed}} on the Upper Outboard Payload Attach System on the S3 (Starboard Segment 3) of the main truss.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the service}} {{designation}} An-8, the new transport {{was built in}} the GAZ-34 factory in Tashkent from 1957 to 1961, as a larger-capacity replacement for the earlier Lisunov Li-2 (DC-3), with a large <b>unpressurized</b> hold, a manned tail gun position, chin radome for navigation/mapping radar and a glazed nose for the navigator.|$|E
25|$|They {{were unable}} to deploy the Port 3 <b>unpressurized</b> cargo carrier {{attachment}} system (UCCAS). They secured the UCCAS in place until engineers can evaluate the problem. Mission Control cancelled the installation of a similar payload attachment system on the starboard side. The port UCCAS was deployed successfully during STS-127 by releasing the stuck pin with a custom made tool.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} production aircraft, designated MU-2B, {{were delivered}} with the Garrett TPE331 engines that remained standard on all later models. Thirty-four MU-2Bs were built, followed by 18 {{examples of the}} similar MU-2D. The Japanese armed forces purchased four <b>unpressurized</b> MU-2Cs and 16 search and rescue variants designated MU-2E. Featuring slightly more powerful upgraded TPE331 engines, 95 examples of the MU-2F were sold.|$|E
25|$|Douceur was evacuated, {{along with}} a doctor and an escort, on an October 17 cargo flight. This was the first flight {{available}} when the weather window opened up on October 16. This first flight is usually solely for supply and refueling of the station, and does not customarily accept passengers, as the plane's cabin is <b>unpressurized.</b> The evacuation was successful, and Douceur arrived in Christchurch, New Zealand, at 10:55p.m. She ultimately made a full recovery.|$|E
25|$|Doors {{which lead}} from interior, pressurized, {{sections}} of an aircraft to exterior or <b>unpressurized</b> areas can pose extreme risk {{if they are}} inadvertently opened during flight. This can be mitigated by having doors that open inwardly and {{are designed to be}} forced into their door frames by the internal cabin pressure – most cabin doors are of this type. However, an outward opening door is often advantageous for cargo doors to maximise available space, and these need to be secured by hefty locking mechanisms to overcome internal pressure.|$|E
25|$|In July the 56th FG {{was moved}} from its {{comfortable}} quarters at Horsham St. Faith to a much-less improved installation at RAF Halesworth, {{along the coast}} of Suffolk, both to be nearer to German-occupied territory and to allow Horsham St. Faith to be completed as a heavy bomber base. On 12 August it used partially filled and <b>unpressurized</b> 200-gallon ferry tanks as jettisonable fuel tanks {{for the first time in}} combat, escorting bombers headed for Bonn, Germany. In its first four months of missions, the 56th Group shot down 9 aircraft and lost 10.|$|E
25|$|Additionally WAAS {{works just}} as well between airports. This allows the {{aircraft}} to fly directly from one airport to another, as opposed to following routes based on ground-based signals. This can cut route distances considerably in some cases, saving both time and fuel. In addition, because {{of its ability to}} provide information on the accuracy of each GPS satellite's information, aircraft equipped with WAAS are permitted to fly at lower en-route altitudes than was possible with ground-based systems, which were often blocked by terrain of varying elevation. This enables pilots to safely fly at lower altitudes, not having to rely on ground-based systems. For <b>unpressurized</b> aircraft, this conserves oxygen and enhances safety.|$|E
25|$|Swanson and Acaba {{began the}} second spacewalk at 16:51 UTC. They {{loosened}} bolts, installed foot restraints and prepared tools {{so that the}} STS-127 spacewalkers could more easily change out the Port 6 truss batteries later this year. On the Japanese Kibo laboratory they installed a second Global Positioning Satellite antenna. They photographed areas of radiator panels extended from the Port 1 and Starboard 1 trusses and reconfigured connectors at a patch panel on the Zenith 1 truss that power Control Moment Gyroscopes. After struggling with a pin that kept an <b>Unpressurized</b> Cargo Carrier Attachment System (UCCAS) from fully deploying, they tied UCCAS safely in place. The spacewalk ended at 23:21 UTC, for a time of six hours and thirty minutes.|$|E
25|$|The first {{production}} Short 360 had its {{maiden flight}} on 19 August 1982 and entered service with Suburban Airlines (later merged with Allegheny Airlines/US Airways) in November 1982. Building on {{the strengths and}} reputation of its 330 antecedent, the 360s found a niche in regional airline use worldwide, being able to operate comfortably from 4,500ft (1,400 m) runways – opening up hundreds of airfields {{that would otherwise be}} inaccessible to airliners. With a cruise speed about 215mph (370km/h), at an altitude of 10,000ft (3,048 m), the <b>unpressurized</b> 360 was not the fastest turboprop in its market but it offered acceptable performance at a reasonable price combined with ease of service and maintainability. The PT6A turboprops are fully ICAO Stage 3 noise-compliant, making the 360 one of the quietest turboprop aircraft operating today. Production of the 360 ceased in 1991 after 165 deliveries. In 1998, approximately 110 360s were in service. In 2009 a retired Emerald Airlines 360 was bought by Kingsland Primary School in Stoke-on-Trent, for use as a mobile classroom.|$|E
25|$|Early {{engine coolant}} {{antifreeze}} was methanol (methyl alcohol). Methanol was {{widely used in}} windshield fluids, however, in Europe, due to new REACH legislation, the use of methanol in windshield fluids is limited to 5% and {{in the near future}} will be further reduced to 3%. As radiator caps were vented, not sealed, the methanol was lost to evaporation, requiring frequent replenishment to avoid freezing of the coolant. Methanol also accelerates corrosion of the metals, especially aluminum, used in the engine and cooling systems. Ethylene glycol was developed, and soon replaced methanol as an engine cooling system antifreeze. It has a very low volatility compared to methanol and to water. Before the 1950s, coolant systems were <b>unpressurized</b> and the engine was often cooler than modern automotive engines. By pressurizing the coolant system with a radiator cap, the boiling point of the fluid is increased, permitting higher engine temperatures and better fuel efficiency. Pressurized systems do not appreciably change the freezing point. Later propylene glycol was introduced due to its environmental credentials.|$|E
25|$|Most U-21s were <b>unpressurized</b> Model 87 derivatives, {{but there}} were also five U-21Fs based on the A100 King Air; and three U-21Js, which Beechcraft {{designated}} Model A100-1, but were actually the first three production Model 200 Super King Airs (C/Ns BB-3, BB-4 and BB-5, after prototypes C/N BB-1 and BB-2 had been built). The majority of U-21s were delivered as U-21As (102 65-A90-1s), {{but there were}} also four RU-21As (65-A90-1s), three RU-21Bs (65-A90-2s), two RU-21Cs (65-A90-3s), 18 RU-21Ds (65-A90-1s), 16 RU-21Es (65-A90-4s), and 17 RU-21Gs (65-A90-1s). The RU-21Es (except one written off) were later converted to U-21Hs and RU-21Hs, with two U-21Hs and an RU-21H being further converted to JU-21Hs. In 1993, the three surviving RU-21As that remained in military service were retired and sent to JW Duff Aircraft Salvage in Denver Colorado. On November 14, 2015, one of aircraft, (67-18113) was donated by Dynamic Aviation to the 138th Aviation Company Memorial to restore the aircraft to be displayed at Orlando International Airport. The majority of the U-21 series were retired {{in the second half of}} the 1990s and most are now owned by Dynamic Aviation of Bridgewater, Virginia. Some have been modified as spraying aircraft and are used on insect control work.|$|E
25|$|The United States Air Corps {{wanted the}} {{aircraft}} to perform high altitude research and {{to test the}} feasibility of a pressurized cabin. The Corps contracted with Lockheed Aircraft Corporation to produce the aircraft at a total cost of $112,197. The requirements called for an aircraft capable of flying at no less than 25,000ft (7,620m) and having an endurance of ten hours {{with at least two}} hours above 25,000ft (7,620m). Major Carl Greene and John Younger, both structures experts who worked for the Air Corps Engineering Division at Wright Field in Ohio were responsible for the design of the pressurized cabin structure. Greene and Younger worked with Lockheed to modify a Model 10 Electra with a new fuselage consisting of a circular cross-section that was able to withstand up to a 10psi differential. New, smaller windows were used to prevent a possible blowout while operating at high pressure differentials. The cabin pressurization was provided by bleeding air from the engines' turbo supercharger, the compressor outlet fed into the cabin and was controlled by the flight engineer. This system was able to maintain a cabin altitude of 12,000ft (3,658m) while flying at 30,000ft (9,144m). The fuselage was divided into two compartments, a forward pressurized compartment, and an aft <b>unpressurized</b> compartment. The forward compartment housed two pilots, a flight engineer, and up to two passengers. The aft compartment provided accommodation for one passenger and could be used only at low altitudes since it lacked pressurization.|$|E
25|$|EVA 1 {{started with}} astronauts Dave Wolf and Tim Kopra {{switching}} their spacesuit power to internal battery at 16:19 UTC. Despite a communication {{problem with the}} spacewalkers, the Japanese Exposed Facility was successfully installed on the Japanese Experiment Module {{by means of a}} complex series of steps involving the robotic arms of both the station and the shuttle. The JEF was first unberthed from the shuttle payload bay by the station arm, after which the shuttle arm took the load. The station arm was then moved to the worksite on Node-2 (Harmony), wherefrom it took the 4.1 ton facility back. The facility was then successfully latched on to the Experiment Module. As part of the EVA, the spacewalkers successfully deployed the port <b>Unpressurized</b> Cargo Carrier Attach System (UCCAS), which could not be deployed during STS-119. During the prior mission, the deployment failed due to a jamming caused by a stuck detent pin. Engineers designed a custom tool to force the pin to release, which was used to deploy the mechanism. Meanwhile, the shuttle managers announced {{that there would be no}} need for a focused inspection of the heat shield. The nose cap and wing leading-edge panels of the shuttle were cleared for entry as they were, but a reentry clearance was not given. Beyond one impact site having a gouge, the rest of the impacts were found to be mostly a loss of coating. The other activity scheduled for EVA 1, the deployment of a starboard side cargo carrier, was postponed for want of time. A fuel cell issue found before launch was analyzed, though the cell continued to function as expected with no impact to the mission.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} health risk on ascent to {{altitude}} is not decompression sickness but altitude sickness, or acute mountain sickness (AMS), {{which has an}} entirely different and unrelated set of causes and symptoms. [...] AMS results not from the formation of bubbles from dissolved gasses in the body but from exposure to a low partial pressure of oxygen and alkalosis. However, passengers in <b>unpressurized</b> aircraft at high altitude may also be at some risk of DCS.|$|E

This endeavor is known as the Perlan Project.|$|E
500|$|Hard suction hose, {{also known}} as a suction hose, is a {{specific}} type of rigid fire hose used in drafting operations. When using this technique, the fire engine draws water for fire fighting from an <b>unpressurized</b> supply, such as a portable water tank, pool, or other static water source, instead of drawing water from a pressurized water supply, such as a fire hydrant. Under complete vacuum conditions, a pump would lift water , however pumps on fire apparatus are not capable of producing a high vacuum. Due to this limitation and friction loss, fire services do not recommend attempting to lift water more than [...]|$|E
500|$|A blocked {{static port}} {{is a more}} serious {{situation}} because it affects all pitot-static instruments. One {{of the most common}} causes of a blocked static port is airframe icing. [...] A blocked static port will cause the altimeter to freeze at a constant value, the altitude at which the static port became blocked. [...] The vertical speed indicator will become frozen at zero and will not change at all, even if vertical speed increases or decreases. [...] The airspeed indicator will reverse the error that occurs with a clogged pitot tube and cause the airspeed to be read less than it actually is as the aircraft climbs. [...] When the aircraft is descending, the airspeed will be over-reported. [...] In most aircraft with <b>unpressurized</b> cabins, an alternative static source is available and can be selected from within the cockpit.|$|E
500|$|During {{refueling}} Cooper outlined {{his flight}} {{plan to the}} cockpit crew: a southeast course toward Mexico City at the minimum airspeed possible without stalling the aircraftapproximately at a maximum [...] altitude. He further specified that the landing gear remain deployed in the takeoff/landing position, the wing flaps be lowered 15degrees, and the cabin remain <b>unpressurized.</b> Copilot William Rataczak informed Cooper that the aircraft's range was limited to approximately [...] under the specified flight configuration, which meant that a second refueling would be necessary before entering Mexico. Cooper and the crew discussed options and agreed on Reno, Nevada, as the refueling stop. Finally, Cooper directed that the plane take off with the rear exit door open and its staircase extended. Northwest's home office objected, on grounds that it was unsafe to take off with the aft staircase deployed. Cooper countered that it was indeed safe, {{but he would not}} argue the point; he would lower it himself once they were airborne.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, {{one of the}} {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts at}} the ballooning record ended with a five-mile (8km) plummet into the Coral Sea {{off the coast of}} Australia that nearly killed Fossett; he waited 72 hours to be rescued, at a cost of $500,000. The first attempt began in the Black Hills of South Dakota and ended outside Hampton, New Brunswick [...] later. The second attempt, launched from Busch Stadium, cost $300,000 and lasted [...] before being downed halfway in a tree in India; the trip set records at the time for duration and distance of flight (with Fossett doubling his own previous record) and was called Solo Spirit after Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis. Fossett slept an average of two hours a night for the six-day journey, conducted in below-zero temperatures. After taking too much fuel to cross the Atlantic Ocean and circling Libya for 12 hours while officials decided whether or not to allow him into their airspace, Fossett did not have enough fuel to finish the flight. That year, Fossett flew farther for less money than better-financed expeditions (including one supported by Richard Branson) in part due to his ability to fly in an <b>unpressurized</b> capsule, a result of his heavy physical training at high altitudes. The Solo Spirit capsule was put on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum across from the Apollo 11 command module.|$|E
