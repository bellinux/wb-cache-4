My mother <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the church and read the Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments over the Chancel, and admire the gilded dove that Mr. Sears had placed high over the Pulpit. The 'Eye' which he also had made seemed to be looking at her no matter where she sat.|$|E
25|$|During sitting meditation, {{practitioners}} usually {{assume a}} position {{such as the}} lotus position, half-lotus, Burmese, or seiza postures, using the dhyāna mudrā. To regulate the mind, awareness is directed towards counting or watching the breath or by bringing that awareness to the energy center below the navel (see also ānāpānasati). Often, a square or round cushion placed on a padded mat is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on; in some other cases, a chair may be used. This practice may simply be called sitting dhyāna, which is zuòchán (坐禅) in Chinese, and zazen (坐禅) in Japanese, jwaseon (坐禅) in Korean.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{entrance to}} the historic center of the town is a colonial era arch, which was built in 1731 and located on {{the southeast corner of}} the main plaza next to the municipal palace. It contains a medallion with an image of Christ as the “Humilladero” (humbled), which colonial travelers worshipped. The arch is made of sandstone in Baroque style with geometric fretwork. At the very top is a small column on which <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> a statue of San Sebastian de Aparcicio. In the 1970s, a bus hit the arch and toppled the statue, which was never replaced.|$|E
500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles {{so that he}} could {{keep an eye out for}} her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Jam stated, [...] "We required that they put her in our hands. We had to do it on our turf, with no bodyguards, no star trips and none of Joe Jackson's people hanging around making suggestions." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. [...] "There's a little radiator I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on when we did the Control album," [...] Jackson recalled in 1993. John McClain served as the executive producer.|$|E
500|$|A {{proud and}} practising Muslim, daily namāz and fasting during Ramadan were {{integral}} to Kalam's life. [...] His father, the imam of {{a mosque in}} his hometown of Rameswaram, had strictly instilled these Islamic customs in his children. His father had also impressed upon the young Kalam the value of interfaith respect and dialogue. As Kalam recalled: [...] "Every evening, my father A.P. Jainulabdeen, an imam, Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, the head priest of the Ramanathaswamy Hindu temple, and a church priest <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> with hot tea and discuss the issues concerning the island." [...] Such early exposure convinced Kalam that the answers to India's multitudinous issues lay in [...] "dialogue and cooperation" [...] among the country's religious, social, and political leaders. Moreover, since Kalam believed that [...] "respect for other faiths" [...] was one of the key cornerstones of Islam, he was fond of saying: [...] "For great men, religion is a way of making friends; small people make religion a fighting tool." ...|$|E

But in many of the worship centres the 'posed' person <b>use</b> <b>to</b> stand and dance, similar to the possessive activities found in some of the tribal belief systems.

Westenra co-wrote four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also {{features}} singer Humphrey Berney. The US/Australia/NZ edition followed in March under the name Celtic Treasure. Westenra dedicated the album to her grandmother, Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the British edition, she wrote: [...] "I come from a musical family, and one with {{a real sense of}} history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from Ireland to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 – there's even a commemoration plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra. My grandmother <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> me on her knee and sing songs like Danny Boy from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles were {{performing}} at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961 {{when they were}} introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was a homosexual, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Brian's reasons for wanting to manage the group {{was that he was}} physically attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in a café in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this." [...] Soon after their return from Spain—at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963—Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club Master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying [...] "How was your honeymoon, John?" [...] The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. To Lennon, who was drunk at the time, the matter was simple: [...] "He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in".|$|E

50|$|Seat of the {{paramount}} {{chief of the}} Nso people (Sehm Mbinglo I), this place {{is the heart of}} Kumbo social and cultural life. It is composed of several traditional buildings decorated with wood carvings, around two courtyards where the Fon <b>uses</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> and receive his people or his advisers. There is a statue of Ngonso, the legendary first queen of the Nso people. Around the palace, other traditional buildings are also decorated with wood carvings. They are the seats of the sacred societies in charge to help the Fon in his task : the Ngwerong society and the Nggiri society. A mosque was built next to them, although most of Nso people are Christians.|$|R
60|$|A quaint old {{door opened}} {{into the little}} stone house, and {{admitted}} us {{to a kind of}} wide passage-way with rooms on either side; and at the end opposite to which we entered, another door opened upon a balcony. From this balcony we looked down on Petrarch's garden, which, presently speaking, is but a narrow space with more fruit than flowers in it. Did Petrarch <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> and meditate in this garden? For me I should better have liked a chair on the balcony, with the further and lovelier prospect on every hand of village-roofs, sloping hills all gray with olives, and the broad, blue Lombard plain, sweeping from heaven to heaven below.|$|R

50|$|Housing in {{this area}} is mixed between older homes that have been around since the {{original}} days of Old Hungarian Village and duplexes that have replaced historic homes after being purchased by landlords. Both the historic and the newer houses are generally single-family, two story frame structures that sit on narrow lots. Alleys border the back of these lots upon what <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> modest scale Queen Anne and Dutch Colonial style homes at a modest price. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a decline in this neighborhood, but it was not as significant as other central city neighborhoods. Between the years of 1976 and 1982, the decline was reversed and the slow rising values can still be seen by residents today.|$|R

60|$|At this moment, before Rilla {{could make}} any reply, Jims {{began to cry}} {{at the top of}} his voice in the room whose open window was just above them--Jims, who hardly ever cried in the evening. Moreover, he was crying, as Rilla knew from experience, with a vim and energy that betokened that he had been already whimpering softly unheard for some time and was {{thoroughly}} exasperated. When Jims started in crying like that he made a thorough job of it. Rilla knew that there was no <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> still and pretend to ignore him. He wouldn't stop; and conversation of any kind was out of the question when such shrieks and howls were floating over your head. Besides, she was afraid Kenneth would think she was utterly unfeeling if she sat still and let a baby cry like that. He was not likely acquainted with Morgan's invaluable volume.|$|R

50|$|In Southern India, in Tamil Nadu/Andhra Pradesh it {{is called}} Seemantham or Valaikaapu or Poochoottal (The expecting mother wears bangles and adorned with flowers) and in Karnataka {{it is called}} Seemanta(ಸೀಮಂತ) and is held when the woman is in her 5th or 7th or 9th month of pregnancy. Although Seemantham, Valaikappu and Poochoottal might be celebrated together, they are very different. Seemantham is a {{religious}} ceremony while Valaikappu and Poochoottal is a purely social event much like Western baby showers. In a Valaikappu and Poochoottal, there is music played, and the expecting mother is decked in traditional attire with lots of flowers and garlands made of jasmine or mogra. A swing is decorated with flowers of her choice, which she <b>uses</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> and swing. At times there are symbolic cut-outs of moons and stars that are put up. There are blessings showered on her by the elderly ladies from the household and community. Gifts are given to the expecting mother.|$|R
