5|$|Both {{of these}} discoveries—the space {{weathering}} effects {{and the low}} density—led to a new <b>understanding</b> <b>about</b> the relationship between S-type asteroids and OC meteorites. S-types are the most numerous kind of asteroid in the inner part of the asteroid belt. OC meteorites are, likewise, {{the most common type}} of meteorite found on the Earth's surface. The reflection spectra measured by remote observations of S-type asteroids, however, did not match that of OC meteorites. The Galileo flyby of Ida found that some S-types, particularly the Koronis family, could be the source of these meteorites.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{relatively}} smaller brains {{compared to}} other primates, lemurs have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence in problem solving that are comparable to those seen in simians. However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which {{may be due to}} adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using objects as tools in the wild, they can be trained to use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic <b>understanding</b> <b>about</b> the functional properties of the objects they are using.|$|E

This {{is not so much a}} criticism of teachers individually but a reflection of how organised / systemic teaching systems have failed to keep pace with increasing <b>understandings</b> <b>about</b> teaching and learning.

Dmitri told Felix he was also interested in marrying Irina, but Irina said she preferred Felix. Felix was able to persuade Irina's reluctant family to relent and allow the ceremony to go forward.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear weapons {{continued}} to be tested in the Cold War, especially in the earlier stages of their development. The toll on the worst-affected populations and the growth since then in <b>understanding</b> <b>about</b> the critical threat to human health posed by radioactivity {{has also been a}} prohibitive complication associated with nuclear power. Though extreme care is practiced in that industry, the potential for disaster suggested by incidents such as those at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl pose a lingering specter of public mistrust. Worldwide publicity has been intense on those disasters. Widespread support for test ban treaties has ended almost all nuclear testing in the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Rabbits are mammals. From the {{perspective}} of the philosophy of science, it is doubtful whether the genuine discovery of mammalian fossils in Precambrian rocks would overthrow the theory of evolution instantly, although, if authentic, such a discovery would indicate serious errors in modern <b>understanding</b> <b>about</b> the evolutionary process. Mammals are a class of animals, whose emergence in the geologic timescale is dated to much later than any found in Precambrian strata. Geological records indicate that although the first true mammals appeared in the Triassic period, modern mammalian orders appeared in the Palaeocene and Eocene epochs of the Palaeogene period. Hundreds of millions of years separate this period from the Precambrian.|$|E
