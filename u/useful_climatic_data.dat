40|$|Inference {{regarding}} {{trends in}} <b>climatic</b> <b>data</b> series, including comparisons across different data sets {{as well as}} univariate trend significance tests, {{is complicated by the}} presence of serial correlation and step-changes in the mean. We review recent developments in the estimation of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust (HAC) covariance estimators as they have been applied to linear trend inference, with focus on the Vogelsang-Franses (2005) nonparametric approach, which provides a unified framework for trend covariance estimation robust to unknown forms of autocorrelation up to but not including unit roots, making it especially <b>useful</b> for <b>climatic</b> <b>data</b> applications. We extend the Vogelsang-Franses approach to allow general deterministic regressors including the case where a step-change in the mean occurs at a known date. Additional regressors change the critical values of the Vogelsang-Franses statistic. We derive an asymptotic approximation {{that can be used to}} simulate critical values. We also outline a simple bootstrap procedure that generates valid critical values and p-values. The motivation for extending the Vogelsang-Franses approach is an application that compares climate model generated and observational global temperature data in the tropical lower- and mid-troposphere from 1958 to 2010. Inclusion of a mean shift regressor to capture the Pacific Climate Shift of 1977 causes apparently significant observed trends to become statistically insignificant, and rejection of the equivalence between model generated and observed data trends occurs for much smaller significance levels (i. e. is more strongly rejected).

40|$|Sustainable {{design of}} {{buildings}} and building services systems requires careful consideration of local climatic conditions and characteristics. Without good information {{and understanding of}} the local climate, {{it is not possible to}} study and achieve optimal building design and efficient building services operation. At present, the building designers, managers and researchers in Hong Kong often find it difficult to identify reliable and accurate weather data and information. Although some meteorological data and design conditions exist, they are not always applied correctly and well understood by the users, because of the data complexity and the abstraction of sustainable design concept. This paper will present the major findings of a research which aims to study and develop the important <b>climatic</b> <b>data</b> in Hong Kong for sustainable building design. By analysing the long-term weather data over the past 114 years and examining the practical issues of building design, <b>useful</b> <b>climatic</b> information and patterns are identified. In addition, the key results from other relevant local and overseas research studies are evaluated so as to assess the present needs and future development of building climatic design. It is hope that the research information will enable people to better understand the local climate and to build up the resources for assessing important issues of energy and environmental design...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates for {{the first}} time in Burkina Faso, the {{potential}} of using an artificial neural network (ANN) for reference evapotranspiration (ETo) estimation. The ANN algorithm generalized regression neural network (GRNN) was selected for its ability to model the ETo from minimum <b>climatic</b> <b>data.</b> The irrigation management in Burkina Faso still faced to <b>climatic</b> <b>data</b> unavailability for estimating the ETo with the recommended Penman-Monteith (PM) equation. Recently, to overcome the <b>climatic</b> <b>data</b> unavailability difficulty, a reference model for Burkina Faso (RMBF) using only temperature as input has been developed for irrigation management purpose in two production sites, Banfora and Ouagadougou. In this study, four alternative methods to PM, including GRNN, RMBF, Hargreaves (HRG) and Blaney-Criddle (BCR) were employed to study their performances in three production sites, Dori, Bogande and Fada N’gourma. The minimum <b>climatic</b> <b>data</b> were set to the maximum and minimum air temperature as input variables collected from 1996 to 2006. The results revealed that, RMBF, HRG and BCR overestimated the ETo and showed poor performance. In addition, GRNN performance was higher than RMBF, HRG and BCR. Finally, wind has been determined as a sensitive parameter in the ETo estimation for the areas studied. Obviously, using GRNN with minimum climatic variables for ETo estimation is more reliable than the other alternative methods. It is possible to estimate ETo by using ANN in semiarid zone of Africa.
