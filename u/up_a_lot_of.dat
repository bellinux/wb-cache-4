5|$|In the 1994–95 NCAA season, {{the sophomore}} was soon {{called one of}} the best {{eligible}} NBA prospects, along with his peers Joe Smith, Rasheed Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse. Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the 1995 NBA draft if he went early, but Duncan assured everyone {{he had no intention of}} going pro until he graduated, even though the NBA was planning to add a rookie salary cap in 1996. He was giving <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money, but was determined to stay in school. In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game against a Rasheed Wallace-led North Carolina Tar Heels. During that game, Duncan neutralized the threat of Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a jump shot with four seconds left in overtime. In the NCAA Tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16, and playing against Oklahoma State, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying Bryant Reeves, but his team lost 71–66. Still, Duncan ended the year averaging 16.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year and became the third-best shot-blocker in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game. He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in each of his two remaining years at Wake Forest.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other therapsids, dicynodonts {{had very}} short snouts and no teeth {{except for the}} tusk-like upper canines. Dicynodonts are {{generally}} thought to have had horny beaks like those of turtles, for shearing off pieces of vegetation which were then ground on a horny secondary palate when the mouth was closed. The jaw joint was weak and moved backwards and forwards with a shearing action, instead of the more common sideways or up and down movements. It is thought that the jaw muscles were attached unusually far forward on the skull and took <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> space {{on the top and}} back of the skull. As a result, the eyes were set high and well forward on the skull, and the face was short.|$|E

Regarding the title, Thayil said, [...] "It was sort of {{off the top of my}} head. I simply like it because it was colorful. It was kinda aggressive, too... It conjures <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> different kinds of images. We like the ambiguity in it, the way it sounded and the way it looked." ...|$|E

500|$|Show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse wrote [...] "I Do" [...] as a [...] "mini-season finale", {{as it was}} {{the last}} episode before mid-season hiatus, and would end in a cliffhanger.

Executive producer Bryan Burk also said the pre-hiatus episodes were [...] "our season 2.5.

500|$|After 10.Qxd2, Tseitlin {{explains}} that [...] "opening manuals assess this position as favourable to White {{on the basis}} of the bishop pair. However, considering the closed nature of the position, White faces substantial difficulties in the realisation of this nominal advantage." [...] Black has not a lot of things to be proud of as there are no targets in White's camp, but can put <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> resistance thanks to small assets. Black's Ne5 is strongly centralised, attacks the c4-pawn, and restricts the Bf1 from moving to the natural squares d3 and f3. Moreover, exchanging the knight with Bxe5 is not appealing for White, since that would mean losing the advantage of the bishop pair. Also, the Bc8 can sometimes become better than its counterpart the Bf1, if it makes it to the good squares b7 or c6 while the Bf1 remains restricted by the Ne5.|$|E
