5|$|After Wau was secured, the {{battalion}} undertook patrolling operations around Mubo, {{along with the}} rest of Kanga Force, before joining the advance on Salamaua in support of the 3rd Division, with a view to drawing Japanese reinforcements away from Lae, where a landing was planned for September. The Japanese put up a strong resistance and {{the battalion}} became involved in heavy fighting around Mubo in May, before fighting at Goodview Junction and Mount Tambu in July and August as part of actions to secure Komiatum; around Goodview, two companies were deployed in a holding action and to attempt to outflank Mount Tambu to cut the Japanese line of communication, while the other two companies attacked Mount Tambu itself. Casualties for the battalion between April and September amounted to 34 killed and 95 wounded. As the 5th Division arrived to take over from the 3rd following the capture of Mount Tambu and the link <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> forces, the 2/5th Battalion was withdrawn from the line, concentrating around Nassau Bay in late August as the 17th Brigade was relieved by the 29th. After a fortnight of unloading ships around the bay, the battalion was moved by landing craft to Milne Bay, where it embarked on the Liberty ship Charles Steinmetz and the Dutch transport Boschfontein. On 23 September 1943, the battalion arrived back in Australia, landing at Cairns, Queensland. The fighting in the Salamaua area resulted in the following losses for the 2/5th: 94 killed and 165 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Unable to move north, the North Koreans {{attempted}} to breakout {{across the open}} rice fields to the west, through {{the gap between the}} 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and US 187 RCT. The North Koreans again suffered heavy casualties, with many cut down by tank and rifle fire from C Company, 3 RAR. Some of the survivors took refuge among a number of haystacks and rice stooks in front of 9 Platoon, from where they engaged the Australians with sniper fire. Others fled east, escaping to the higher ground where they dispersed. D Company, 3 RAR was subsequently ordered to clear pockets of resistance remaining within the battalion position. Meanwhile, the Middlesex battalion passed through the Australians and, with the tanks, linked <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 187 RCT at 11:00. Following three hours of fighting the battle was largely over by midday; however, many of the North Koreans that had been unable to escape continued to refuse to surrender, hiding or feigning death until individually flushed out. After clearing their objectives 7 and 8 Platoon had moved forward towards 9 Platoon, which then clashed with a number of North Korean stragglers in the paddy fields. C Company, 3 RAR subsequently deployed in an extended line and a substantial action soon developed. In a scene Coad later likened to driving snipe, the Australians subsequently proceeded to sweep the area, kicking over stacks of straw and shooting the North Korean soldiers they found hiding in them as they {{attempted to}} flee. For his leadership Butler was subsequently awarded the US Silver Star, while Private John Cousins received the US Bronze Star {{for his role in the}} action.|$|E

25|$|The 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery, {{also managed}} to {{withdraw}} and link <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Army's 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion. These units provided close heavy gun support.|$|R
25|$|The 57th/60th and 58th/59th Infantry Battalions {{continued}} to patrol heavily {{across a wide}} area around the Bogadjim Road, and they subsequently joined <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> troops around Sungum. The Japanese had re-orientated themselves into positions at various locations including Alibu, Rereo, Wenga, Redu and Kaliko. During this time, {{a number of small}} unit actions were undertaken as the Japanese attempted to ambush the Australians while the Australians in turn sought to infiltrate the Japanese positions. On 22 April, large amounts of Japanese supplies were found abandoned by a patrol from the 57th/60th as {{it became clear that the}} Japanese were withdrawing from the area in a hasty fashion.|$|E
25|$|In the {{fighting}} that followed, Kokoda village was retaken on 2 November, providing the Australians with a forward airfield for supplies to be flown into, which helped resolve {{many of their}} supply difficulties. As {{the rate of the}} Australian advance increased, in mid-November heavy fighting took place around Oivi and Gorari, where the Australians and Japanese fought the final battle of the campaign before crossing the Kumusi River. In December 1942, the Battle of Buna–Gona saw the Australians link <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> ground forces. They would subsequently clash with the Japanese around the northern beachhead amidst heavy fighting which lasted until late January 1943, when the remainder of the Japanese garrison was withdrawn to Salamaua–Lae.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} minor engagements {{followed}} {{in the foothills of}} the Finisterre Range before the Australians came up against strong resistance centred around the Kankiryo Saddle and Shaggy Ridge, which consisted of several steep features, dotted with heavily defended rocky outcrops. After a preliminary assault on a forward position dubbed The Pimple in late December 1943, the Australians renewed their assault in mid-January 1944 and over the course of a fortnight eventually captured the Japanese positions on Shaggy Ridge and the Kankiryo Saddle, after launching a brigade-sized attack up three avenues of advance. In the aftermath, the Australians pursued the Japanese to the coast and subsequently took Madang, linking <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> and Australian forces.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Madang, fought between early February {{and late}} April 1944, was the {{break-out}} and pursuit {{phase of the}} Markham and Ramu Valley– Finisterre Range and Huon Peninsula campaigns, which {{were part of the}} wider New Guinea campaign of World War II. After overcoming the Japanese defences around Shaggy Ridge, the Australian forces descended the steep slopes of the Finisterre Range and pursued the withdrawing Japanese towards Bogadjim and then Madang on the north coast of New Guinea. There they linked <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> and Australian forces that had advanced along the coast from the Huon Peninsula, while the remnants of three Japanese divisions withdrew towards Wewak, where further fighting would take place throughout late 1944 and into 1945.|$|E
25|$|Finally on 21 January 1943 the Australians linked <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> {{forces and}} the Sanananda village fell. Shortly {{afterwards}} the regiment was withdrawn back to Dobodura airstrip from where they were transported back to Australia. The casualties that the regiment had suffered during the fighting were very high with 54 men killed and 67 wounded. On top of this over 200 men had contracted malaria and three had died from scrub typhus. Among those that were killed was the regiment's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Edgar Logan. During its time in the Middle East and in New Guinea, the regiment lost 59 men killed or died on active service and 67 wounded. Four members of the regiment were decorated with the Military Medal.|$|E
25|$|In March 1942, the Japanese landed troops around Lae and Salamaua in the Australian {{mandated}} territory of New Guinea. A seaborne assault on Port Moresby was turned back in May at the Battle of the Coral Sea, {{after which the}} Japanese established a beachhead at Buna–Gona in late July as plans were made to capture Port Moresby via an overland route from the northern Papuan coast. Subsequently heavy fighting {{took place during the}} Kokoda Track campaign and around Milne Bay. The Japanese advance ended just before their objective and subsequently the Australians went on the offensive, eventually pursuing the withdrawing Japanese back to their beachheads around Buna and Gona where the Australians linked <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> forces and heavy fighting followed against the Japanese between November 1942 and January 1943.|$|E

25|$|Yaula was {{captured}} on 4 April linking up with {{elements of the}} 2/2nd Commando Squadron. A few days later, the 11th Division, {{under the command of}} Major General Allan Boase took over from the 7th, and they subsequently linked <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> forces on the coast around Rimba as they pushed forward along an axis bounded by the Kabenau and Nuru Rivers. Bogadjim was reached on 13 April and on 23 April troops from the 8th Brigade came ashore there, effecting a link up between the 5th Division, which had been advancing along the coast from Saidor, which had been secured by US and Australian forces in January– February 1944. Madang was subsequently taken on 24–25 April by troops from the 8th and 15th Brigades, while the 30th Infantry Battalion secured Alexishafen the following day. A follow up landing was made by the 37th/52nd Infantry Battalion on Karkar Island, while the 35th Infantry Battalion secured a large quantity of abandoned Japanese stores at Hansa Bay, and pushed patrols towards the Sepik River.|$|E
25|$|After {{taking over}} the western drive up the Ramu River from the 24th Infantry Battalion, the 2/2nd Commando Squadron {{advanced}} from Kesawai and then to Orgoruna, linking up with the 57th/60th Infantry Battalion around Yaula on 4 April. Advancing along a motor road that had been laid by the Japanese, the Australians moved along an axis bounded by the Nuru River and Kabenau River. The withdrawing Japanese offered stiff resistance, but continued to withdraw, allowing the Australians to link <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> forces around Rimba. Bogadjim was eventually reached on 13 April. Meanwhile, part of the 11th Division's divisional carrier company was flown into Wantoat in response to intelligence of Japanese patrols in the area. The dismounted troops fought a brief engagement with about 20 Japanese soldiers on 14 April during which four Japanese were killed and one Australian wounded. The Australians subsequently expanded their patrols towards {{the confluence of the}} Wantoat and Ikwap Rivers. Detecting a small group withdrawing to the north, they returned to Wantoat. A later patrol resulted in four Japanese being taken prisoner.|$|E

500|$|During the crisis, Gingrich's {{public image}} {{suffered}} from {{the perception that the}} Republicans' hardline budget stance was owed partly to an alleged snub of Gingrich by Clinton during a flight on Air Force One to and from Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in Israel. That perception developed after the trip when Gingrich, while being questioned by Lars-Erik Nelson at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast, said that he was dissatisfied that Clinton had not invited him to discuss the budget during the flight. He complained that he and Dole were instructed to use the plane's rear exit to deplane, saying the snub was [...] "part of why you ended <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> sending down a tougher continuing resolution". In response to Gingrich's complaint that they were [...] "forced to use the rear door," [...] NBC news released their videotape footage showing both Gingrich and Dole disembarking at Tel Aviv just behind Clinton via the front stairway.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{commenced}} {{after only}} half a day's rehearsal and without a finished script; the actors received {{the rest of their}} lines in daily dispatches. According to Warren, [...] "dear old Max Cuff was trying to keep <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> He was writing like mad." [...] Certain scenes were partly or wholly improvised: one example is a sex scene between the characters of Jessica and Jo, which was added mainly to boost the film's overseas distribution prospects. Many of the crew had recently come off the production of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, on which Marcel had served as assistant director. They completed an average of 35 camera set-ups per day, employing hand-held shots whenever they fell behind schedule and filming scenes in no more than three takes to lower costs. Stokes needed injections to ease the discomfort caused by the contact lenses that he was required to wear as part of his alien make-up. The bird Wally was a cockatoo that often refused to perform when needed and squawked loudly off-camera, frequently causing problems with the sound recording. He eventually escaped from his cage and was never seen again.|$|E

[...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering around for years. When it was time to write Life Is Peachy, we went back into the rehearsal studio and we wanted to take the elements that the fans liked and we liked about Korn and elaborate on some of those like Jonathan freaking out. [...] "Twist" [...] came to life. There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. I think a lot of that came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a really angry album." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the battalion's return, it {{undertook}} further jungle {{training at}} Ravenshoe on the Atherton Tablelands.
