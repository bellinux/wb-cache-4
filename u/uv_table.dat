40|$|Protein {{detection}} on SDS gels or on 2 -D gels must combine several features, such as sensitivity, homogeneity {{from one}} protein to another, speed, low cost, and user-friendliness. For some applications, {{it is also}} interesting to have a nonfixing stain, so that proteins can be mobilized from the gel for further use (electroelution, blotting). We show here that coelectrophoretic staining by fluorophores of the oxacarbocyanine family, and especially diheptyloxacarbocyanine, offers several positive features. The sensitivity is intermediate between the one of colloidal CBB and the one of fluroescent ruthenium complexes. Detection is achieved within 1 h {{after the end of}} the electrophoretic process and does not use any fixing or toxic agent. The fluorescent SDS-carbocyanine-protein complexes can be detected either with a laser scanner with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm or with a <b>UV</b> <b>table</b> operating at 302 nm. Excellent sequence coverage in subsequent MS analysis of proteolytic peptides is also achieved with this detection method...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} between Sypro Ruby and ruthenium II tris (bathophenanthroline disulfonate) as fluorescent stains for protein detection in gels A {{comparison between}} two fluorescent metal chelates for staining proteins separated by electrophoresis {{has been carried}} out. One of these chelates is ruthenium II tris (bathophenanthroline disulfonate) {{and the other is}} commercial Sypro Ruby. Both can be efficiently detected either with <b>UV</b> <b>tables</b> or with commercial laser fluorescence scanners. The sensitivity and homogeneity of the stains and the interference with mass spectrometry analysis have been investigated. It appears that both stains per-form similarly for protein detection, while ruthenium II tris (bathophenanthroline disul-fonate) performs better for mass spectrometry analyses and as cost-effectiveness ratio. However, Sypro Ruby is easier to use as a stain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>UV</b> <b>tables,</b> {{rather than}} {{input-output}} table adopted in most literature, {{are used to}} analyze the embodied CO 2 emissions of China in this paper. This method can avoid overestimating the embodied emission coefficients, the key factor to estimate the total emissions. Based on the assumption of "emissions avoided by imports " (EAI), we calculated China’s emissions embodied within products manufactured domestically (EEP) and those within products consumed domestically (EEC) in 1997, 2002 and 2007. The result shows that all of EEP exceeded EEC in the three years. The diffences (EEB) were 575. 85, 627. 30 and 1834. 12 million tons, being 17. 15 %, 17. 16 % and 27. 20 % of EEP respectively. It means approximate 1 / 6 ~ 1 / 4 of per unit CO 2 manufactured in China was consumed “purely ” by other countries, also called "carbon leakage". Furthermore,we built a fixed effects model to detect the factors influcing the emission coefficients. It is found that technical progress will be helpful to decrease the coefficients, meanwhile, the total emissions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The γ-ray burst source GRB 970508 {{has been}} {{detected}} as a continuum point source at 86. 2 GHz with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). By combining the <b>UV</b> <b>tables</b> of May 17 th, 19 th, 21 st and 22 nd, one obtains a point source flux of 1. 62 ± 0. 25 mJy, which {{amounts to a}} 6. 5 σ detection. Three individual tentative detections were made on May 19 - 22, and the source was only non-detected later with 3 σ upper limits between 0. 87 and 1. 83 mJy. Observations at 232 GHz gave only upper limits. The lowest one from combined May 19 and 21 data is 4. 5 mJy (3 σ). No significant variation of the source during individual observing dates was seen in either frequency band. Comparing the May 17 - 22 detection with the later nondetections, we see a significant fading which is not well fitted with the F ∝ t − 1. 1 ± 0. 1 law found at higher frequencies. We exclude that the 86. 2 GHz fluxes have been modulated significantly by interstellar scintillation. This indicates that the millimetre characteristics of GRB 970508 provide a new aspect of the intrinsic development of the source. Key words: Gamma-ray bursts – GRB 970508 – radio continuum observations 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{planetary}} nebula NGC 6537 {{appears to be}} an irregular bipolar object. Conventional procedures have been employed to observe the spectrum of NGC 6537 with the image dissector scanner at the Lick 3 -m telescope. Both red- and green-sensitive tubes were employed in order to cover the spectrum from the practical UV limit near lambda 3300 A to the near-infrared limit near lambda 8600 A. The instrumental response function was determined {{on the basis of the}} observation of suitable comparison stars. On Oct. 23, 1984, observations with the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) were obtained. A table containing the optical region spectrum of NGC 6537 is presented along with a <b>table</b> providing the <b>UV</b> fluxes, a <b>table</b> listing the ionic concentrations, and a table with data describing the chemical composition of NGC 6537. Attention is given to theoretical models and the determination of the nebular chemical composition, and aspects of plasma diagnostics...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study the effect of ultra-violet (UV) {{treatment}} alone and in combination with 100 % CO 2 modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) was evaluated both on the survival of naturally occurring bacteria, {{as well as on}} quality parameters of table eggs during 28 days of storage at 21 °C. Table eggs were collected from the conveyor belt after the UV module, and placed on carton trays. A representative number of carton trays were packed in a high barrier multilayer pouch filled with 100 % CO 2. All eggs were stored at 21 °C and analysed at 0, 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of storage. Eggs not treated with UV and not packed were also included. On the eggshells total colony count, total coliforms and faecal coliforms counts, as well as the detection of Salmonella spp. were investigated. Moreover, chemical-functional parameters such as weight loss, albumen pH and Haugh Unit (HU) were evaluated. The total colony count on <b>UV</b> treated <b>table</b> eggs was approximately 1 log 10 CFU/g lower than untreated eggs (2. 27 vs 3. 29 log 10 CFU/g). During storage, CO 2 packed eggs maintained the initial values of HU, whereas the albumen pH decreased up to 1. 5 - 2 points in comparison to unpacked eggs. The UV treatment was effective in reducing the total colony count on the surface of table eggs. MAP showed a great potential in maintaining/enhance the technological properties of egg constituents (higher foam stability of the albumen for meringue preparation) without significantly impacting on the microbial load of table eggs...|$|R
