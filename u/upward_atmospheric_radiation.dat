40|$|A new {{one-dimensional}} radiative equilibrium {{model is}} built to analytically evaluate the vertical {{profile of the}} Earth's <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radiation</b> entropy flux {{under the assumption that}} <b>atmospheric</b> longwave <b>radiation</b> emission behaves as a greybody and shortwave radiation as a diluted blackbody. Results show that both the atmospheric shortwave and net longwave radiation entropy fluxes increase with altitude, and the latter is about one order in magnitude greater than the former. The vertical profile of the <b>atmospheric</b> net <b>radiation</b> entropy flux follows approximately that of the <b>atmospheric</b> net longwave <b>radiation</b> entropy flux. Sensitivity study further reveals that a ‘darker’ atmosphere with a larger overall atmospheric longwave optical depth exhibits a smaller net radiation entropy flux at all altitudes, suggesting an intrinsic connection between the <b>atmospheric</b> net <b>radiation</b> entropy flux and the overall atmospheric longwave optical depth. These results indicate that the overall strength of the atmospheric irreversible processes at all altitudes as determined by the corresponding atmospheric net entropy flux is closely related to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere...|$|R
