40|$|Leaf and (unripe and ripe) berry {{essential}} oils of Juniperus oxycedrus ssp. badia (H. Gay) Debeaux grown wild in Spain have been analysed by capillary GC and GC-MS {{in combination with}} retention indices. A seasonal investigation of both leaf and berry oils was also performed. Among the approximately 80 constituents investigated (representing 90 - 98 % of the oils) 60 - 68 were identified (80 - 97 % of the oil composition). The leaf oils were mainly composed of alpha-pinene (40 - 57 %) and manoyl oxide (5 - 10 %). The (<b>unripe)</b> <b>berry</b> oils were dominated by alpha-pinene (65 %) with moderate amounts of myrcene, limonene, germacrene D or gamma-muurolene. Several differences in yields and chemical composition from a qualitative and quantitative point of view were detected when comparing all the oil samples analysed. In addition, two oil samples were examined, but found inactive, against the replication of HIV- 1 (III(B)) and HIV- 2 (ROD) in cell culture, whereas the samples were toxic for the cells at a 50 % cytotoxic concentration of 106 and 123 microg/ml, respectively. status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|Alder {{buckthorn}} charcoal is prized in {{the manufacture}} of gunpowder, being regarded as the best wood for the purpose. It is particularly highly valued for time fuses because of its very even burn rate. The wood was formerly used for shoe lasts, nails, and veneer. The bark yields a yellow dye, and the <b>unripe</b> <b>berries</b> furnish a green dye.|$|R
50|$|The berries are oblong {{and about}} 1 cm long. Inferior coffee results from picking them too early or too late, so many are picked by hand {{to be able}} to better select them, as they do not all ripen at the same time.

Mari wedding songs {{consistently}} reproduce the main stages and features of the wedding ceremony. The procedure of Mari wedding is strictly fixed and every stage of it expresses a special meaning. The aim of the article is to study a symbol in Mari wedding songs. The surrounding world, the wedding ceremony, its participants and guests, their characteristics, actions and conditions are the main objects of symbolization. The {{results show that the}} wedding ceremony in songs is presented as the process of picking up berries, a harvest, road connections, cutting of trees. <b>Unripe</b> <b>berries,</b> a rowan, a poppy, a beautiful, golden bird, a chicken are the symbols of a bride. A groom is associated with a high-spirited horse. Symbols and images of the groom’s parents are created by using such characters as a white dove, hatching dove. Some symbols are common in all Finno-Ugric languages. Some unique symbols which appear only in Meadow Mari and Hill Mari wedding songs are described in the article. Some symbols such as a harvest, <b>unripe</b> <b>berries</b> are similar to the symbols of Russian folk songs. The similarity of symbolized objects can be explained by direct contact the Mari have with the Russians.

However, mountain possums appear to eat it without ill effect, and stripping of bark, leaves, and terminal shoots has destroyed pure stands of S.mauritianum. Watt & Brandwijk state that horses, domestic chickens and all birds eat the fruit with impunity, and further state that no records of poisoning in children exist, casting doubt on contrary published accounts.|$|R

40|$|It is {{not clear}} how the xylem of a plant organ with a low {{transpiration}} rate, such as the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) bunch, is anatomically linked to surrounding leaves. The aim was to test the hypothesis that xylem connections to the grapevine bunch are sectorial using an apoplastic dye and a radioactive membrane-permeable nutrient analogue. The transport of eosin and pertechnetate (⁹⁹mTcO₄ -) revealed that bunches bearing <b>unripe</b> <b>berries</b> have xylem connections with primary leaves located {{on the same side of}} the shoot (common orthostichy) as the bunch. These connections also exist with secondary shoots arising from axillary buds in the same orthostichy as the bunch. These connections can include leaves in both orthostichies of the secondary shoot. Connections between the bunch and primary leaves in the opposite orthostichy are relatively uncommon. The challenge for future research is to determine the degree to which these connections are functional under normal physiological conditions. 5 page(s...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT), an {{imaging modality}} that uses reflected near-infrared light to generate micron-scale resolution, cross-sectional images of biological tissue, {{was applied to}} imaging of various botanical subjects. Example images are given of sectioned kiwifruit, orange flesh, orange peel, lettuce leaves, and intact cranberries. OCT appears to be well suited for botanical imaging; features at the tissue and cellular level in these subjects were well defined. Cranberries were imaged {{at different stages of}} ripeness as judged by flesh color, and repeatable differences were seen in the OCT images of ripe and <b>unripe</b> <b>berries.</b> This preliminary study suggests that OCT can be a valuable tool for non-destructive, morphological imaging of botanical subjects. Keywords. Cranberry, Kiwifruit, Lettuce, Microscopy, Orange. Several techniques have been applied to botanical imaging, with emphasis on physiological research, morphological imaging, and quality control.

40|$|Thaumatin-like {{proteins}} (TLPs) {{were isolated}} and characterized from fruits and leaves of elderberry (Sambucus nigra) and their corresponding genes cloned. In addition, the developmental regulation and induction {{of the different}} TLPs was followed in some detail. Ripening berries accumulated a fruit-specific TLP during {{the final stages of}} maturation. This fruit-specific TLP had no antifungal activity and was devoid of beta-glucanase activity. Leaves constitutively expressed a TLP that closely resembled the fruit-specific homologue. Treatment with jasmonate methyl ester induced two additional TLPs in leaves but did not induce or enhance the expression of TLPs in immature berries. In contrast to jasmonate methyl ester, both ethephon and garlic extract induced the expression of a TLP in <b>unripe</b> <b>berries</b> that normally do not express any TLP. Sequence analysis and molecular modeling indicated that all elderberry thaumatin-like proteins share a high sequence similarity with group- 5 pathogenesis-related proteins.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{involvement}} of chitinases in the interactions between grape berries and fungi, three genomic sequences encoding chitinases were isolated by PCR walking on Vitis vinifera DNA. Two of these belong to class I chitinases with a putative vacuolar (Vvchit 1 a) and extracellular (Vvchit 1 b) localization whilst the third sequence belongs to class III (VvchitIII). Transcripts of class III chitinases were shown to accumulate in <b>unripe</b> <b>berries</b> infected with Plasmopara viticola but not at later developmental stages of berries infected with Uncinula necator or Botrytis cinerea. In contrast, class I transcripts were never detected in grape berries. Specificity of chitinase expression in response to pathogens was investigated in leaves infected with B. cinerea or Pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi, a bacterium leading to an incompatible interaction. Expression of the Vvchit 1 a gene was induced in leaves upon both infections. In contrast, accumulation of class III transcripts was observed in response to P. syringae but not to B. cinerea infection, whereas Vvchit 1 b transcripts were detected in leaves only in the latter case. Our data indicate that, in V. vinifera, induction of chitinase genes depends on the infecting pathogen...|$|R

After incubation through the heart beating stage (grayish black eggs), the brooders in each salinity were separately transferred to the hatching tank with 15 ppt for {{the second part of}} the study. After hatching, the healthy larvae from the brooders which were previously incubated in 3 salinities were collected for the larviculture experiment. The closed recirculating water system with trickling filter unit packed with fiberglass and bioballs was used as incubation and larviculture units. The metamorphosis period and survival rate were examined. The rearing water from each larviculture aquarium was collected for Sodium, Magnesium, Potassium, Calcium and Chlorine determination. The percentage of ripe berried females (heart beating stage embryos) were not significantly different (p> 0. 05) between 5 and 15 ppt salinities but their values were significantly higher (p 0. 05) for survival rate of post larvae and metmorphosis period among the treatments...|$|R

In order to control these organisms and to prevent their proliferation, we selected three secondary metabolites extracted from fungi, bacteria, and plants, with biocide properties. Cells free culture filtrate of fungus Trichoderma harzianum T- 22, cells free culture filtrate of bacterium Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola ICMP 11096 strain (Bga) and glycoalkaloids extracts from <b>unripe</b> <b>berries</b> of Solanum nigrum were tested on Hontoria limestone, a biosparitic limestone, used in many Spanish monuments, inoculated with phototrophic microorganisms. The efficacy of those natural products and the microbial inhibition were evaluated by spectrophotometric determination of chlorophyll a for the quantification of photosynthetic biomass. In addition, the quantification of surface covered areas was carried out by means of digital image analysis. The glycoalkaloids showed to be the most efficient biocide.

50|$|Atropa baetica has a short {{growing season}} (around 5 months), favouring sites {{subjected}} to heavy winter precipitation {{in the form}} of snowfall and a hot summer/early autumn. The green shoots begin to sprout at ground level in mid-May. Growth (initially very rapid - stems reaching their full height in a mere 3-4 weeks) continues until early August, involving also residual summer growth of small leaf-rosettes (associated with the spread of the clump of rhizomes) which persist near ground level without giving rise to flowering stems.Anthesis (flowering) can occur from as early as the third week in June until mid-August, the greatest number of open flowers being present during the first fortnight of July. <b>Unripe</b> <b>berries</b> may be seen from late June up until the third week of September. Ripe berries are present from the beginning of September to mid-October, nearly all being ripe by the end of September.Senescence is observable between early/mid-September and late October: the first signs of foliar senescence have become noticeable by mid-September and by mid-October practically all plants are reduced to stands of leafless stems, the non -flowering basal rosettes being the last to lose their leaves. The last vestiges of aerial growth disappear shortly after the first rains or heavy falls of snow.|$|R
