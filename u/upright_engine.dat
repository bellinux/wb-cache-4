60|$|At {{last the}} boat {{came in and}} we trooped aboard--a queer mixture of men and bundles. The boat itself was a mere scow with an <b>upright</b> <b>engine</b> in the centre and a stern-wheel tacked on the outside. There were no staterooms, of course, and almost no bunks. The {{interior}} resembled a lumberman's shanty.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{very rare}} Mamod ME2 from 1958, showing the <b>upright</b> <b>engine</b> unit and Rotherams pot oiler ...|$|E
50|$|The ME2 was {{introduced}} in 1958 {{at the same time}} as the ME1. Dimensions of this engine are the same as the ME3, except that it had a Mamod <b>upright</b> <b>engine</b> as opposed to the SEL <b>upright</b> <b>engine</b> used in the ME3. The ME2 was not particularly successful and was replaced by the ME3 in 1965. The fact that the ME1 represented a complete engine unit, whilst the ME2 basically was the boiler and engine unit probably worked against their success.|$|E
5000|$|A-62: First {{prototype}} with [...] Renault 4Pb 4-cylinder <b>upright</b> inline <b>engine.</b> Flying by September 1931.|$|R
50|$|The Ca.124 was {{powered by}} a 900 hp (670 kW) Isotta-Fraschini Asso XI.RC15, a {{water-cooled}} <b>upright</b> V-12 <b>engine,</b> supercharged to maintain power to 1,500 m (4,920 ft). Bombs were contained within the fuselage, below the wing.|$|R
5000|$|... 3×Renault 4Pb 4-cylinder <b>upright</b> {{air-cooled}} inline <b>engines</b> 70 kW (95 hp): F-ALKR re-engined August 1932.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, Honda {{released}} its venerable, light weight, 99 cc OHC single 2-valve <b>upright</b> <b>engine.</b> This {{was a direct}} challenge to the off-road market which was, at this time, dominated by the two-strokes. A sea wave of change was to quickly follow many of its CB, CL and SL based models.|$|E
50|$|Some {{buses and}} trains with {{straight}} engines have their engines mounted with {{the row of}} cylinders horizontal. This differs from a flat engine because it is essentially an inline engine laid on its side. Underfloor engines for buses and diesel multiple units (DMUs) commonly use this design. Such engines may {{be based on a}} conventional <b>upright</b> <b>engine</b> with alterations to make it suitable for horizontal mounting.|$|E
50|$|The Ca.125 was a wire braced single bay biplane with slender, elliptical, unequal span wings; {{pairs of}} {{parallel}} interplane struts defined the bays and, because the lower wings had the greater span, these struts leaned inwards. The wings had neither stagger nor sweep. Ailerons were fitted {{only on the}} lower planes. In contrast to the elegant wingplan, the fuselage was deep and portly, in part {{a consequence of the}} enclosed, tandem cockpits. Since the canopies' rooflines followed that of the upper fuselage, the crew sat low down, with poor forward views. The forward view was also hindered by the six-cylinder <b>upright</b> <b>engine,</b> which had to be placed high in the nose to properly locate the thrustline. As a result, the top of the cowling was at the same height as that of the windscreen; there was only a small gap between the screen and the rear of the engine. Cabane struts joined the wing centre section to the fuselage over the forward cockpit; a shallow trailing edge cutout somewhat improved upward visibility from the rear seat.|$|E
50|$|The Type 543 Baby was a {{two-seater}} with a 2 ft 6 in (76 cm) fuselage extension. It too {{was initially}} Green-powered, but in 1926, this {{was replaced by}} an 80 hp (60 kW) ADC Cirrus 1 air-cooled <b>upright</b> inline <b>engine.</b>|$|R
50|$|Powered by a 90hp Wright Gipsy four-cylinder <b>upright</b> inline piston <b>engine</b> (one C-7C and 22 C-7D built).|$|R
50|$|F.13be, ce, de, fe: as {{the above}} but all with 230 kW (310 hp) Junkers L5 <b>upright</b> inline {{water-cooled}} <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The F 13 first flew on 25 June 1919, {{powered by}} a 127 kW (170 hp) Mercedes D IIIa inline <b>upright</b> {{water-cooled}} <b>engine.</b> The first production machines had a wing of greater span and area and had the more powerful 140 kW (185 hp) BMW IIIa upright inline water-cooled motor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} of the HD.5 was flat-sided with rounded decking. The fighter was {{powered by}} a [...] Hispano-Suiza 8Fb <b>upright</b> V-8 <b>engine,</b> water-cooled with a rectangular frontal radiator, and had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on a single axle attached by V-struts to the lower fuselage, assisted by a tailskid.|$|R
5000|$|The C.74 {{was a large}} biplane, {{powered by}} four [...] Hispano-Suiza 8Fb water-cooled, <b>upright</b> V-8 <b>engines</b> mounted in two pairs, each pair with one engine in tractor {{configuration}} and the other as a pusher. It was built from wood and steel and covered in plywood and fabric. [...] An enclosed cabin could accommodate ten passengers.|$|R
50|$|The 1911 catalog {{showed the}} Gideon line of <b>upright</b> marine semi-diesel <b>engines</b> and boasted that it powered {{most of the}} fishing fleets in Denmark and Norway.|$|R
50|$|Soon, {{construction}} of a plant on Castro Street in Oakland began. This {{became known as the}} Pacific Seventh-day Adventist Publishing Association. Equipment installed included a four-roller airspring drum cylinder press powered by an <b>upright</b> donkey <b>engine,</b> a paper cutter, a book trimmer, and some new type. Soon the Signs of the Times circulation had passed 4,000.|$|R
5000|$|The A-60 first flew late in 1930. A second aircraft, the A-61 {{was built}} {{with a more}} powerful, uncowled [...] Salmson 7Ac seven {{cylinder}} radial engine. This made its first flight on 9 September 1931. The A-60 was re-engined with a [...] Renault 4Pb four cylinder <b>upright</b> inline <b>engine</b> and renamed the A-62. It was flying by September 1931.|$|R
5000|$|Speedway uses {{a unique}} type of motorcycle, {{governed by the}} FIM's [...] "Track Racing Technical Rules". In the past, bikes with <b>upright</b> <b>engines</b> were used (the name taken {{from the way the}} engine sits in the frame), but today most {{professional}} riders use laydown bikes as it is argued that they are easier to handle. As speedway bikes do not use brakes, the clutch is used as a release mechanism at the start of races. FIM regulations state that the motorcycles must have no brakes, are fueled by pure methanol, use only one gear and weigh a minimum of 77 kg. By using engine and rear wheel sprockets the gear ratio can be adjusted as required for track conditions. The use of methanol allows for an increased compression ratio to the engine producing more power than other fuels and resulting in higher speeds (approximately 130 km/h when cornering).|$|R
50|$|The Lancashire boiler was {{patented}} in 1844, and the economiser in 1845. This can {{been seen}} as a square brick structure between the boiler house and the chimney. The engines were double compound <b>upright</b> beam <b>engines</b> of the type patented by McNaught in 1845. Each room in the mill would have line shafts suitable for the type of frame, connected by belt drives or gearing.|$|R
50|$|F.13ba, ca, da, fa: {{all with}} the 149 kW (200 hp) Junkers L2 <b>upright</b> inline {{water-cooled}} <b>engine</b> {{and a series of}} structural modifications. The fa variant was about 1 m (3 ft) longer.|$|R
5000|$|The Arc-en-Ciel was {{powered by}} three [...] Hispano-Suiza 8Ac {{water-cooled}} <b>upright</b> V8 <b>engines.</b> One {{was in the}} nose {{and the other two}} ahead of the wing leading edge, all within cowlings that followed the V8's cylinder heads and cooled with Lamblin radiators. Seven wing fuel tanks held a total of 6200 L. The thickness of the wing at its root allowed crew to reach the engines in flight via a corridor 700 mm high.|$|R
5000|$|The B-4's {{fuselage}} {{was based}} on a chrome-molybdenum steel frame. It had a [...] American Cirrus III four-cylinder, <b>upright</b> inline <b>engine</b> in the nose with an aluminium firewall and tanks in the wing roots. The two tandem cockpits, fitted with dual controls, were over the wing. The view from the forward cockpit, placed around quarter-chord, was good and the instructor's view from the rear cockpit was improved with windows in the underside wing roots.|$|R
2500|$|The RK.25's <b>upright</b> Cirrus <b>engine</b> was neatly cowled in weight-saving elektron, {{following}} the upper cylinders to minimise their obstruction of the pilot's forward view. [...] The fuselage had a welded steel tube structure with fabric-covered sides and underside and a curved top which continued the narrow upper engine fairing dorsally. There were two open cockpits in tandem, one {{occupied by the}} navigator over the rear wing and the other by the pilot, behind the trailing edge.|$|R
50|$|The Pétrel was an <b>upright</b> V-12 <b>engine</b> {{with two}} banks of six cylinders, {{arranged}} at 60° to each other, driving a common crankshaft. The cylinder blocks were bolted onto the crankcase, all light alloy parts. The crankcase came in two pieces, with seven crankshaft bearings {{in the upper}} section. Roller bearings were used at the crankshaft ends; the remaining five were plain. The upper crankcase section also had integrally cast water channels {{as part of the}} cooling system.|$|R
50|$|The fighter was {{powered by}} a Hispano-Suiza 8Fb {{water-cooled}} <b>upright</b> V-8 <b>engine.</b> The pilot's open cockpit was over {{the trailing edge of}} the lower wing; both planes had central cut-outs to improve the pilot's view. A large Busteed inflatable buoyancy airbag between the undercarriage legs was provided for emergency landings on the sea. The HD.20 had a fixed tailskid undercarriage, with mainwheels on a single axle mounted on the lower fuselage longerons by two pairs of V-struts.|$|R
5000|$|The NW type J is {{a veteran}} {{automobile}} manufactured by Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriks-Gesellschaft A.G. ("NW", now known as [...] "Tatra"). Two basic versions are recognized - the initial [...] "J (30)" [...] with a 30 HP engine, and the later [...] "J (40)" [...] with a 40 HP engine. As well as types [...] "K" [...] and [...] "L", it had <b>upright</b> four-cylinder <b>engines</b> of side-valve design. The engines in the three types were rather heavy, 4 to 5 liters.|$|R
5000|$|The Wib 1 was {{powered by}} a [...] Hispano-Suiza 8B, a water-cooled, <b>upright</b> V8 <b>engine.</b> This was neatly housed under a smooth curved cowling behind a large, domed spinner and drove a two blade propeller. A pair of {{synchronised}} 7.7 mm Vickers machine guns fired through the propeller arc. It had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with the mainwheels on a rigid axle attached to the lower fuselage {{by a pair of}} faired V-struts, together with a small tailskid.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{different}} engines were {{proposed for}} the Ca.61a, [...] Isotta Fraschini V.6s or [...] SPA 6As, both six-cylinder <b>upright</b> water-cooled inline <b>engines.</b> From the powers quoted for the Ca.61 and the Ca.61a earlier design had Isotta Fraschinis and the later one SPAs.|$|R
50|$|The Sergant A was a French 4-cylinder, air-cooled, <b>upright</b> inline piston <b>engine</b> with {{a maximum}} output of , {{designed}} {{to meet the needs of}} the very small and light single seat sports aircraft of the early 1920s. It was used by at least ten different types.|$|R
2500|$|To {{keep them}} {{clear of the}} spray of take-off, each of the Robbe's two [...] BMW IV {{water-cooled}} six cylinder <b>upright</b> inline <b>engines</b> was mounted in pusher configuration high above the wings on vertical faired steel tube N-form struts, the forward inner one particularly sturdy, and with transverse V-strut bracing with its apex on the central, upper fuselage. The engines were cooled with radiators {{in the front of}} the engine cowling and behind shutters controlled from the cockpit. There was a reserve fuel tank above each engine.|$|R
50|$|The Dewoitine D.30 first {{appeared}} in public at the Paris Aero Show in December 1930. It was a single-engine, ten-seat passenger aircraft with a high cantilever wing and rectangular-section fuselage. It had a fabric-covered metal frame and was powered by a 485 kW (650 hp) Hispano-Suiza 12Nbr water cooled, <b>upright</b> V-12 <b>engine.</b> This engine was closely cowled, the cowling following {{the profile of the}} two cylinder banks, and drove a two-blade propeller; it was cooled with a Lamblin radiator mounted ventrally at its rear.|$|R
5000|$|To {{keep them}} {{clear of the}} spray of take-off, each of the Robbe's two [...] BMW IV {{water-cooled}} six cylinder <b>upright</b> inline <b>engines</b> was mounted in pusher configuration high above the wings on vertical faired steel tube N-form struts, the forward inner one particularly sturdy, and with transverse V-strut bracing with its apex on the central, upper fuselage. The engines were cooled with radiators {{in the front of}} the engine cowling and behind shutters controlled from the cockpit. There was a reserve fuel tank above each engine.|$|R
2500|$|The Hanriot HD.15 was {{designed}} {{in response to}} a government call for a turbo-supercharged high altitude fighter-reconnaissance aircraft. It was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 8Fb 8-cylinder <b>upright</b> water-cooled V-8 <b>engine</b> fitted with a [...] turbo-supercharger intended to maintain sea level powers to altitudes up to [...]|$|R
5000|$|Forward visibility, though {{better in}} the D.III than the D.I was still not good and LFG tried to improve it with another variant, the D.V. The {{fuselage}} diameter was decreased and the decking forward of the cockpit lowered exposing all of the upper parts of the engine cylinders. Three were built, one with the Argus engine of the D.II and two with the [...] Mercedes D.III, another <b>upright</b> 6-cylinder <b>engine.</b> The visibility was not much improved and the problem was only solved with the LFG Roland D.VII, which used a V-8 engine.|$|R
5000|$|The Bernard 260 was {{powered by}} a [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Xbrs liquid cooled <b>upright</b> V-12 <b>engine.</b> Several {{different}} radiator arrangements were tried. For the first flight, made by Roger Baptiste in September 1932, a boxed chin radiator was used but was soon replaced {{by a pair of}} vertical units attached to the undercarriage legs. By November these had been replaced with a curved, open radiator under the engine, followed by yet another unsatisfactory system in January 1933. In March a retractable Villard-Ferlay radiator was fitted; this was used in the competitive tests.|$|R
