5|$|The Eldorado Mine at Port Radium was {{a source}} of <b>uranium</b> <b>ore.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Uranium</b> <b>ore</b> is mined {{in several}} ways: by open pit, underground, in-situ leaching, and {{borehole}} mining (see uranium mining). Low-grade <b>uranium</b> <b>ore</b> mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% uranium oxides. Extensive measures must {{be employed to}} extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% uranium oxides on average. <b>Uranium</b> <b>ore</b> is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali. The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% uranium oxides U3O8. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion.|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting for}} an {{opportunity}} to launch this operation, the Alsos Mission learned that <b>uranium</b> <b>ore</b> that had been taken from Belgium in 1944 had been shipped to the Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft (WiFO) plant in Stassfurt, which was captured by the 83rd Infantry Division on 15 April. As it was in the occupation zone allocated to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference, the Alsos Mission, led by Boris Pash and accompanied by Lansdale, arrived on 17 April to remove anything of interest. Over the following ten days, 260 truckloads of <b>uranium</b> <b>ore,</b> sodium uranate and ferro-uranium weighing about 1,000 tons were taken away.|$|E
5000|$|Uranium-236 is {{produced}} in <b>uranium</b> <b>ores</b> by neutrons from other radioactives.|$|R
50|$|It can {{be found}} {{alongside}} other very rare selenium-bearing <b>uranium</b> <b>ores,</b> such as haynesite, guilleminite, marthozite and piretite.|$|R
50|$|The {{acid process}} of milling <b>uranium</b> <b>ores</b> {{involves}} precipitating uranyl sulfate from the pregnant leaching solution {{to produce the}} semi-refined product referred to as yellowcake.|$|R
5|$|Uranium used {{to produce}} the first atom bombs from 1942 to 1948 was {{processed}} by Linde Air Products in nearby Tonawanda, and in 1944, the Manhattan Engineer District began using the LOOW site for the storage and transshipment of radioactive residues and wastes created through the processing of <b>uranium</b> <b>ore</b> at Linde.|$|E
5|$|Polonium was {{discovered}} in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie, when it was extracted from <b>uranium</b> <b>ore</b> and identified solely by its strong radioactivity: {{it was the first}} element to be so discovered. Polonium was named after Marie Curie's homeland of Poland. Polonium has few applications, and those are related to its radioactivity: heaters in space probes, antistatic devices, and sources of neutrons and alpha particles. Polonium's intense radioactivity makes it dangerously toxic.|$|E
5|$|Szilárd was {{concerned}} that German scientists might also attempt this experiment. The German nuclear physicist Siegfried Flügge published two influential articles on the exploitation of nuclear energy in 1939. After discussing this prospect with fellow Hungarian physicist Eugene Wigner, they decided that they should warn the Belgians, as the Belgian Congo was the best source of <b>uranium</b> <b>ore.</b> Wigner suggested that Albert Einstein might be a suitable person to do this, as he knew the Belgian Royal Family.|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for the specific}} determination of <b>uranium</b> in <b>ores</b> by cathode ray polarography. The uranium is separated by a simple and rapid mercury-cathode electrolysis, then determined polarographically in a base electrolyte in which vanadium, titanium and tungsten do not interfere. Application of the method {{to the analysis of}} tens standard <b>uranium</b> <b>ores</b> is shown...|$|R
40|$|On page 569 of our article (Stewart et al., 1986) we {{emphasized}} the critical dependence of our ideas upon {{the validity of}} the isotopic and paleontologic geochronology, and on the calibration between the two methods. Wyman also emphasizes this same point but introduces other information—namely, isotopic dates on <b>uranium</b> <b>ores</b> in the Chinle Formation. He indicates, citing the work of Miller and Kulp (1963), that the average date for <b>uranium</b> <b>ores</b> in the Chinle Formation in the Cameron area, Arizona, is 175 Ma and in Lisbon Valley, Utah, is 150 Ma. These averages, however, seem meaningless because they incorporate individual dates that range from 101 to 218 Ma at Cameron, and from 95 to 207 Ma at Lisbon Valley. In any case, recent data (not cited by Wyman) gives a concordant U-Pb age of 206 ± 1 Ma for <b>uranium</b> <b>ores</b> from the Chinle Formation in Lisbon Valley (Ludwig et al., 1986). ...|$|R

5|$|Technetium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Tc and atomic number 43. It is the lightest element whose isotopes are all radioactive; none are stable. Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically, and only minute amounts {{are found in}} the Earth's crust. Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous fission product in <b>uranium</b> <b>ore</b> or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores. The chemical properties of this silvery gray, crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese.|$|E
5|$|Uranium is more {{plentiful}} than antimony, tin, cadmium, mercury, or silver, and it {{is about}} as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. Uranium is found in hundreds of minerals, including uraninite (the most common <b>uranium</b> <b>ore),</b> carnotite, autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0.1% uranium).|$|E
5|$|When labor {{disputes}} delayed {{construction of}} the Metallurgical Laboratory's new home in the Red Gate Woods, Compton decided to build Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear reactor, under the stands at Stagg Field. Under Fermi's direction, it went critical on December 2, 1942. Compton arranged for Mallinckrodt to undertake the purification of <b>uranium</b> <b>ore,</b> and with DuPont to build the plutonium semi-works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the advent}} of nuclear reactors, {{protactinium}} was separated for scientific experiments from <b>uranium</b> <b>ores.</b> Nowadays, it is mostly produced as an intermediate product of nuclear fission in thorium high-temperature reactors: ...|$|R
50|$|Iron oxide copper {{gold ore}} {{deposits}} (IOCG) {{are important and}} highly valuable concentrations of copper, gold and <b>uranium</b> <b>ores</b> hosted within iron oxide dominant gangue assemblages which share a common genetic origin.|$|R
5000|$|Soddyite is {{a mineral}} of uranium with {{chemical}} formula: (UO2)2SiO4·2H2O. It has yellow crystals and usually mixed with curite in oxidized <b>uranium</b> <b>ores.</b> It {{is named after}} Frederick Soddy (1877-1956), British radiochemist and physicist.|$|R
5|$|In April 1945, Groves sent Lansdale to Europe, {{where he}} worked with the Alsos Mission to secure 1,000 tons of <b>uranium</b> <b>ore</b> from the German Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft (WiFO) plant in Stassfurt. He also participated in the {{planning}} and execution of Operation Harborage, in which a special Allied force went deep behind enemy lines, seized 1.5 tons of uranium ingots, and captured a number of German nuclear energy project scientists, including Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Max von Laue, Karl Wirtz, Horst Korsching and Erich Bagge and Otto Hahn.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of actinium in the Earth's crust {{is only about}} 5%. Actinium is mostly present in uranium-containing, but also in other minerals, though in much smaller quantities. The content of actinium in most natural objects corresponds to the isotopic equilibrium of parent isotope 235U, {{and it is not}} affected by the weak Ac migration. Protactinium is more abundant (10−12%) in the Earth's crust than actinium. It was discovered in the <b>uranium</b> <b>ore</b> in 1913 by Fajans and Göhring. As actinium, the distribution of protactinium follows that of 235U.|$|E
5|$|The <b>uranium</b> <b>ore</b> {{was handed}} over to the Combined Development Trust, a legal entity set up to handle the {{acquisition}} of nuclear ores and materials. Lansdale had written a legal opinion for the Manhattan Project that it was within the powers of the President of the United States to conclude such agreements with the British without consulting Congress. In July 1945, Lansdale concluded an agreement with Brazil for the purchase of 3,000 tons of thorium-bearing monazite ore. For his wartime services, Lansdale was awarded the Legion of Merit and was made an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} isotope of neptunium, neptunium-237, is a {{by-product}} of nuclear reactors and plutonium production. It, and the isotope neptunium-239, are also found in trace amounts in <b>uranium</b> <b>ores</b> due to neutron capture reactions and beta decay.|$|R
25|$|Hydrothermal uranium {{deposits}} {{encompass the}} vein-type <b>uranium</b> <b>ores.</b> Igneous deposits include nepheline syenite intrusives at Ilimaussaq, Greenland; the disseminated uranium deposit at Rossing, Namibia; and uranium-bearing pegmatites. Disseminated deposits {{are also found}} in the states of Washington and Alaska in the US.|$|R
50|$|The Subarnarekha {{passes through}} areas with {{extensive}} mining of copper and <b>uranium</b> <b>ores.</b> As {{a result of}} the unplanned mining activities, the river is polluted. The Subarnarekha has been the lifeline of tribal communities inhabiting the Chhotanagpur region and water pollution affects their livelihood.|$|R
5|$|In mid-1943 the District Engineer of the Manhattan Engineer District, Lt-Col Kenneth Nichols {{had several}} queries from Canada {{relating}} to contracts Canadian firms Eldorado Gold Mines and Consolidated Mining and Smelting (CMS of Cominco) {{had for the}} secret atomic bomb project; CMS was building a heavy water plant and Eldorado was mining and processing <b>uranium</b> <b>ore.</b> He phoned a C. D. Howe in Ottawa and arranged to travel on the overnight train to Ottawa and see Howe the next day (June 14). On arriving at the address given Nichols {{was surprised to find}} that Howe was the minister of munitions and supply, and found him most friendly. Howe was told about the Manhattan Project, and Nichols was told that Eldorado was now a Crown company.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, T-Force {{had moved}} into the Petit Palais. The {{main body of the}} Alsos Mission soon followed, and the Mission opened an office at the Place de l'Opéra. On 5 September, word was {{received}} that the British 21st Army Group was about to enter Brussels. There were two important Alsos Mission objectives in Belgium: the corporate headquarters of Union Minière du Haut Katanga, the world's largest supplier of <b>uranium</b> <b>ore,</b> in Antwerp, and its uranium processing plant in Olen. A six-man Alsos Mission team set out to secure them, led by Pash and the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, at ETOUSA, Colonel G. Bryan Conrad.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and isolation of radium in <b>uranium</b> <b>ore</b> (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked {{the development of}} uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, uranium tile glazes accounted {{for the bulk of}} the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, mauve, black, blue, red and other colors.|$|E
40|$|Mineralogical {{controls}} exert significant {{control over}} the extraction of <b>uranium</b> from its <b>ores.</b> <b>Uranium</b> speciation, associated mineralogy, deportment and uranium mineral availability are all factors for consideration when assessing leachability. This study presents data from laboratory uranium extractions undertaken on several contrasting <b>uranium</b> <b>ores</b> {{from a wide range}} of orebodies. The results provide insight into the mineralogical factors of importance when considering uranium extraction. These results are presented within the wider context of geometallurgy and demonstrate how geometallurgical assessment, even at an early stage of mine development, can greatly assist in the design of a suitable extraction scheme...|$|R
40|$|Results {{are given}} for an inter-laboratory {{comparison}} of methods for {{the determination of}} <b>uranium</b> in <b>ores.</b> Four different <b>uranium</b> <b>ores</b> were carefully prepared and samples distributed to eleven participating laboratories. The ores were analysed by several techniques, including spectrophotometric, fluorimetric, X-ray fluorescence, radiometric, and titrimetric procedures. Statistical analysis of {{the results showed that}} {{there was no significant difference}} between the uranium values found using spectrophotometric, fluorimetric, or X-ray fluorescence methods. An Appendix contains some suggested modifications to the A. A. E. C. bromo-PADAP spectrophotometric method...|$|R
40|$|Brannerite, UTi 2 O 6, {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{refractory}} uranium minerals and it requires aggressive leaching conditions for efficient uranium extraction. It is often associated with apatite and fluorite, which affect the leaching process by formation of iron-phosphate and iron-fluoride complexes, respectively. While the effects of these gangue minerals on uranium leaching processes are well documented, there is little to no information on these effects specific to brannerite containing ores. At the high acid concentrations required for brannerite dissolution (> 25 g/L H 2 SO 4), acid soluble gangue will dissolve faster, posing a bigger problem than under milder conditions. The addition of 10 g/L fluorapatite reduced the extraction of both uranium and titanium from brannerite over the full range of leaching conditions studied (25 – 96 °C, 25 – 100 g/L H 2 SO 4, 2. 8 g/L Fe 3 +). Phosphate caused the formation of secondary titanium oxide on the surface of leached brannerite particles. This was not observed when leaching in the absence of phosphate. The secondary titanium oxide phase was enriched in phosphorus. The negative effects of phosphate on uranium leaching were reduced at higher acid concentrations (> 50 g/L H 2 SO 4) and increased at higher temperatures (96 °C). When leaching high-P refractory <b>uranium</b> <b>ores,</b> higher acid concentrations are needed for effective extraction compared with low-P <b>uranium</b> <b>ores.</b> Elevated temperatures were less effective for increasing uranium extraction, suggesting that the optimum temperature for leaching high-P refractory <b>uranium</b> <b>ores</b> is lower than the optimum temperature for leaching low-P <b>uranium</b> <b>ores.</b> Fluorite (10 g/L) had a positive effect on uranium and titanium extraction. This was attributed to the formation of hydrofluoric acid during the dissolution of fluorite. Brannerite particles were heavily pitted and corroded after leaching in the presence of fluorite, with near complete dissolution occurring in 2 – 3 h...|$|R
5|$|The most {{successful}} Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs, {{a member of}} the British Mission who played an important part at Los Alamos. The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada. Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of Harry Gold, David Greenglass, and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Other spies like George Koval and Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades. The value of the espionage is difficult to quantify, as the principal constraint on the Soviet atomic bomb project was a shortage of <b>uranium</b> <b>ore.</b> The consensus is that espionage saved the Soviets one or two years of effort.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of uranium}} {{in its natural}} oxide form dates back to at least the year 79 CE, when {{it was used to}} add a yellow color to ceramic glazes. Yellow glass with 1% uranium oxide was found in a Roman villa on Cape Posillipo in the Bay of Naples, Italy, by R. T. Gunther of the University of Oxford in 1912. Starting in the late Middle Ages, {{pitchblende}} was extracted from the Habsburg silver mines in Joachimsthal, Bohemia (now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic), and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry. In the early 19th century, the world's only known sources of <b>uranium</b> <b>ore</b> were these mines.|$|E
5|$|Although Canada was a {{major source}} of <b>uranium</b> <b>ore</b> and heavy water, these were {{controlled}} by the Americans. Anglo-American cooperation broke down, denying the Montreal Laboratory scientists access to the materials they needed to build a reactor. In 1943, the Quebec Agreement merged Tube Alloys with the American Manhattan Project. The Americans agreed to help build the reactor. Scientists who were not British subjects left, and John Cockcroft became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944. The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and the Montreal Laboratory was closed in July 1946. Two reactors were built at Chalk River. The small ZEEP went critical on 5 September 1945, and the larger NRX on 21 July 1947. NRX was for a time the most powerful research reactor in the world.|$|E
50|$|Boltwoodite is a {{hydrated}} potassium uranyl silicate mineral with formula HK(UO2)(SiO4)·1.5(H2O). It {{is formed}} from the oxidation and alteration of primary <b>uranium</b> <b>ores.</b> It {{takes the form}} of a crust on some sandstones that bear uranium. These crusts tend to be yellowish with a silky or vitreous luster.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Uranium</b> <b>ores</b> are {{normally}} processed by grinding the ore materials to a uniform particle size and then treating the ore {{to extract the}} uranium by chemical leaching. The milling process commonly yields dry powder-form material consisting of natural uranium, [...] "yellowcake," [...] which is sold on the uranium market as U3O8.|$|R
50|$|The {{lixiviant}} varies {{according to}} the ore deposit: for salt deposits the leachate can be fresh water into which salts can readily dissolve. For copper, acids are generally needed to enhance solubility of the ore minerals within the solution. For <b>uranium</b> <b>ores,</b> the lixiviant may be acid or sodium bicarbonate.|$|R
