40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to uncover the {{determining}} factors behind the feminisation of the Swedish bank sector 1910 - 1939, through analysis of time-series and the <b>Union</b> <b>periodical</b> Bankvärlden. Economic and institutional explanations are tried, from a structural-analytical and gender perspective. The results show that feminisation was most rapid during the 1910 ’s, driven by a strong demand for labour from an expanding bank sector. An enabling factor was {{a change in the}} character of work through mechanisation and Taylorism, which in combination with an unfavourable real wage development reduced the interest of the male corps to stay in the profession. For women, the sector remained an attractive workplace relative to their alternatives. When banking entered a phase of rationalisation from the 1920 ’s and the demand for labour waned, employers were motivated to keep and increase their share of female labour on account of its lesser cost...|$|E

5|$|Following the {{suppression}} of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the consequent exile of political dissidents from the Russian Empire, Russian-language journalism in New York City enjoyed a revival. Among the fledgling publications were a number of political newspapers and labor <b>union</b> <b>periodicals,</b> including Golos Truda, which the Union of Russian Workers in the United States and Canada began publishing in the city in 1911, initially on a monthly basis. The newspaper adopted the ideology of anarcho-syndicalism, a fusion of trade unionism and anarchist philosophy which had emerged from the 1907 International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam and along similar lines in America through the influential Industrial Workers of the World. The anarcho-syndicalists rejected state-oriented political struggle and intellectualism, instead proposing labor unions as the revolutionary agents that would bring about an anarchist society characterised primarily by worker collectives.|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the military}} and tactical training {{of the members of}} the Lithuanian Riflemen’s Union for guerrilla warfare in the interwar period. Small nations, such as Lithuania and other Baltic states, being unable to build up military strength in order to ensure national security, were forced to seek for unconventional methods of warfare, including guerrilla strategies. The study places emphasis on the development of the guerrilla war concept in the <b>Union</b> <b>periodicals.</b> The author retraces a change in the intensity of the guerrilla warfare concept propagation amongst Lithuanian population and riflemen, in particular, through publications in the Trimitas — a periodical of the Lithuanian Riflemen’s Union. The author also identifies the narratives associated with the guerrilla matters employed for propaganda purposes in order to create an image of a guerrilla as a defender of the Homeland — Lithuania. Additionally, the structure and numbers of the Union are analysed through a comparison with similar organisations of the other «small nations» of the Baltic North-East. The author addresses the issue of military missions planned by the Lithuanian Army, as well as the way riflemen implemented them. Since the Union did not only offer military training, but was also engaged in the patriotic propaganda, the article focuses on the network of cultural institutions, homes of riflemen, orchestras, libraries, choirs, and athletic clubs used by the Union. The article sets out to establish whether the loss of Lithuanian sovereignty could have been possible without giving rise to a protracted guerrilla war. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{its three}} hundred year existence, the American {{newspaper}} is being devastated as the Internet becomes the go-to source for news. Despite {{the rise in}} Internetjournalism, the sharp increase in online readership, and the precipitous drop {{in the number of}} print newspapers, policymakers still have a dismissive attitude toward alternative news sources. Such attitudes must change. In particular, the government should give online-only journalists increased access to the Galleries of the House of Representatives, the Senate, and other state-owned facilities where mainstream journalists are permitted. With a world-wide audience of millions of readers, Congress and the courts {{can no longer afford to}} relegate Internet journalism to a second-class news medium. In Consumers <b>Union</b> v. <b>Periodical</b> Correspondents 2 ̆ 7 Association, the plaintiff the non-profit organization that publishes Consumer Reports, questioned the constitutionality of certain rules governing the issuance of press credentials to the Galleries when it was denied admission on ground that it was not an independent publication. Based on separation-of-powers concerns, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit avoided the constitutional issue with the political question doctrine, deeming the matter nonjusticiable. Since then, many courts have taken a similar path when faced with the exclusion of a journalist from an established press facility, completely skirting the constitutional issue of whether denial of access violates the freedom of the press protected by the First Amendment. Given the switch from traditional print media to websites and Kindles, the question of who has access to the places where the news is made becomes extremely important. If and when a court will be forced to decide the constitutional issue, it will need a set of principles that balance the constitutional concerns of Congress with the constitutional rights of the online journalist. This Article will attempt to set forth those principals while at the same time explaining the history, the nature of the rights, and the state of the law as it exists today...|$|R
40|$|In 1983, the National Hellenic Documentation Centre {{started the}} {{development}} of the <b>Union</b> Catalogue of <b>Periodicals</b> in the Hellenic Scientific and Technological Libraries. The union catalogue was developed in a database form. Today (January 2000), the union catalogue includes 206 Hellenic scientific, technological and medical libraries, two of which are located in Cyprus. These libraries belong {{to a wide range of}} organisational and institutional types, such as universities, hospitals, research institutions, private companies and commercial banks, covering all scientific and technological fields. The total national collection of serials amounts to 22, 790 unique titles, which correspond to 57, 790 subscriptions. The overlapping coefficient is at 2. 53 (= subscriptions per unique journal title). The annual cost comes to 25, 195 million Euros (1 Euro = 328 drachmas). A macroeconomic approach is attempted, to investigate the upper and lower levels of savings that could be realised by reduction of over-lapping subscriptions. While library budgets have been continuously cut during recent years, under certain conditions, a reasonable and coordinated reconstruction of the individual libraries’ collections could save every year 20 %– 50 % of the total subscription cost and therefore expand the national collection by the same percentage.

After the shift of most member libraries to the digital era, the HILL-net is coexisting, in a symbiotic and complementary way, with access to electronic journals. The network started its pilot operation in 1994, initially with six member-libraries. It currently consists of 127 member-libraries, located in Greece (including one in Cyprus).

5000|$|During {{the period}} called [...] "Bauisme" [...] {{in the history}} of Tortosa, in 1925 Bau was {{unanimously}} elected mayor of the city, re-elected in 1928 and holding the post until 1930. His contribution was multifold; during 5 years the Bau-led ayuntamiento executed the plan of public works, consisting of modernization of city streets, refurbishment of public schools and hospitals and setting up regular fire brigade services. He inaugurated Instituto Nacional de Segunda Ensenanza and Escuela de Trabajo, expanded local railway line and enhanced the county road network. Much of his activity was about tackling Ebro-related issues, like floods, navigation, bridges or land re-cultivation. Largely successful and sort of celebrated by Alfonso de Borbón and the dictator as one of the youngest mayors, he nevertheless failed in his attempt to elevate Tortosa - since 1833 part of the Tarragona province - to the provincial capital range, the new unit to be carved out from these of Tarragona, Castellón and Teruel.Though dictatorship was initially welcomed by the Carlists as a stepping stone towards a Traditionalist monarchy, in 1925 the claimant Don Jaime switched to opposition.

In order to overcome this problem, libraries which have similar collections are looking for cooperation opportunities and try to give their users possible best service pushing {{the limits of their}} limited budgets. This study aims to determine the current situations of business libraries in Ankara and try to answer the question of if there is a overlap in the subscriptions of periodicals and databases in their collections which requires cooperation among these business libraries. In this regard, 13 business libraries were picked up and their preiodical and database list between 2000 - 2006 were examined and overlapping publications were determined. Also, an on-line national business library model was recommended in term of modern library services. The hypotheses of the study; Main hypothesis: “The different budget, collection, personnel, and organizational structures of business libraries/information and record management centers and their parent institutions in Ankara obstructs having a cooperation for shared collection development for periodicals and joint retrieval of records. ” Sub-hypotheses: “Lack of professional personnel, organizational policies of fulfilling information needs of staff, and user centred structure for their own patrons are {{one of the main reasons}} inhibiting to have cooperation among these libraries as well as continuity of this kind of collaboration. ” “In terms of determining collection content and development, each institution acts independently according to their staff’s preferences and focuses on sub-categories of business discipline in their collections. Consequently, this reduces subscription of shared titles and impedes cooperation among institutions for collection development. ” “The limited size of the collections and having a small number of periodicals subscription decrease the amount of similar publications or periodicals titles and prevent from establishing cooperation for collection development. ” “Although there is a need for a <b>union</b> catalogue for <b>periodicals</b> in business libraries, the lack of the cooperation among these institutions obstruct having this type of product. ” Above mentioned hypothesies are approved according to the result of the research...|$|R
