40|$|There {{are many}} {{cryptographic}} systems that use complex operations involving substitutions and permutations to produce resistant ciphertext, {{even if the}} level of the security of these cryptosystems are good, there should be trade-off between security level and operation cost, and the ever increasing virtual infrastructure and mobile, cloud computing technologies creating much more complexities and demanding cost effective and secure cryptographic algorithms. A cryptographic system is said to be secure if the ciphertext does not contain adequate details to find out the matching plaintext. In fact, one can produce <b>unbreakable</b> <b>ciphertext</b> by supplying randomly generated key on each bit of data that is mathematically infeasible to break. Since different random bits or keys would not lead to any repeating patterns. For the first time, in this paper, we present a construction method to generate multiple random keys from a core-key with highest possible immunity to crack. We are with a particular emphasis on novel technique to secure user data, we have designed a secure and cost effective new cryptosystem called Rbits (Random bits) cypher. In different directions we identify that Rbits having highest immunity to crack and presenting various analysis tests in support from this viewpoint and the analyzed results are reported...|$|E
