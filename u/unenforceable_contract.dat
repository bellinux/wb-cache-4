40|$|While {{this author}} {{agrees with the}} Wrigg Court’s {{ultimate}} decision, the Court’s overall discussion was lacking on three points. First, before determining whether an agreement has the requirements of an enforceable noncompete clause, the Court should have addressed the contract issues involved in Wrigg. In particular, the Court should have addressed the question of consideration and the potential ambiguity surrounding {{the terms of the}} shareholder agreement. If the agreement is an <b>unenforceable</b> <b>contract,</b> enforceability of the non-compete clause becomes irrelevant. Next, even if a contract is enforceable, a non-compete clause within it is not automatically enforceable. As a general rule, post-employment, non-competes are allowed if they fall within certain parameters, one of which is the reasonableness of the clause. Although an inexact science, such a determination usually depends upon the use of a balancing test. As part of that balance, courts should consider the evolving psychological contract. The modern employer-employee relationship is based on an unspoken promise by the employer to ensure the employee is competitive in the job market, and courts should examine whether it makes sense to enforce a non-compete agreement under such circumstances. This is especially true in Montana, where an employer can impede the employee’s strong statutory protections against wrongful discharge by asking her to sign a term employment agreement— effectively turning her into a quasi at-will employee. Finally, the Court’s unclear position regarding how “for-cause termination” may affect the enforceability of non-compete agreements provides little guidance to district courts on how they should decide future cases. As such, it is likely that some trial courts will see Wrigg as a per se prohibition against noncompete agreements when the employee is involuntarily terminated; while other courts may interpret Wrigg {{in such a way that}} allows them to look to the circumstances of termination prior to determining the enforceability of the non-compete agreements. In failing to adequately address this critical issue, the Wrigg Court has invited inconsistent application among Montana’s district courts and an inevitable revisiting of the issue for a more definitive clarification...|$|E
40|$|There is {{controversy}} over awarding punitive damages by arbitration in securities disputes. Securities disputes are unique because {{the vast majority}} of such disputes are filed at Self Regulatory Organizations (“SROs”) which are subject to SEC oversight. However, other securities disputes are filed at the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), which is not subject to SEC oversight. As a result differing rules evolved for SRO arbitrations than those applicable at the AAA. No SRO rule directly authorized punitive damages but section 31 (d) of the Uniform Code of Arbitration prohibits limiting the ability of arbitrators to make any award. Whereas a AAA rule specifically provided that arbitrators may award any remedy or relief which the arbitrators deem just and equitable. Predictably, the turmoil over punitive damages continued in the courts. The Ruder Committee Report proposed the imposition of a cap on punitive damages of $ 750, 000. Even if the SEC approved the rigid cap rule in a filing by the National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD”), the question arises where is the legislative authorization to deprive an investor of relief otherwise available in court? The Supreme Court through McMahon gave an investor the ability to obtain in arbitration whatever relief was available in court, which the Ruder Report’s cap rule clearly violates. The rigid cap rule must be rejected {{in view of the fact}} that it bears no reasonable relationship to compensatory damages, its unilateral imposition by an SRO subjects it to questionable validity, it is strongly opposed by the public, it is not imposed at the AAA or at the other SRO arbitration forums, it violates Section 31 of the Uniform Code of Arbitration, it buttresses the argument that the pre-dispute arbitration agreement has become an <b>unenforceable</b> <b>contract</b> of adhesion, it rekindles public distrust of the SRO arbitration process, it violates the spirit under which McMahon was decided, and there are less objectionable ways to solve the securities industry’s fears of a runaway punitive award...|$|E
40|$|Arbitration clauses in {{contracts}} require {{consumers to}} waive {{their rights to}} bring litigation in court. The clauses are often unavoidable because firms include arbitration clauses in contracts of adhesion. In recent years, firms have begun to load their arbitration clauses with unconscionable terms unrelated to arbitration itself. For example, firms insert terms that shorten statutes of limitations, reduce damages, or prohibit injunctive relief. These contract terms are considered unconscionable – and, thus, unenforceable – in many states. However, the Supreme Court has interpreted the Federal Arbitration Act (the FAA) to require judicial deference to arbitration clauses. Consequently, many courts allow firms to bootstrap <b>unenforceable</b> <b>contract</b> terms into an enforceable arbitration clause {{in order to make}} those unconscionable contract terms enforceable. The Supreme Court has invoked the legislative intent of the 1925 Congress in order to assert that the FAA applies to consumer contracts. Courts have further suggested that Congress intended arbitration clauses to be enforced as written and that this requires deference to anti-consumer terms that would otherwise be found unconscionable under state law. Finally, the Supreme Court has asserted that the FAA preempts all state efforts to police arbitration clauses, including basic notification requirements. This Article examines the actual legislative history of the FAA and explains that Congress never intended the FAA to apply to consumer contracts. Congress was exclusively concerned with the enforceability of arbitration agreements between sophisticated businesses in commercial disputes. Congress never considered the possibility that retailers would impose mandatory arbitration clauses on their customers, let alone that these arbitration clauses would be structured to limit damages, to truncate statutes of limitation, or to otherwise remove procedural protections from consumers. The congressional intent that courts should enforce anti-consumer terms in arbitration clauses is an imagined one. The Article concludes that courts should stop asserting that the FAA mandates enforcement of unconscionable terms so long as they reside in an arbitration clause. When confronting unconscionable terms in arbitration clauses, courts can take one of three actions: enforce the unconscionable terms; sever the unconscionable terms; or strike the arbitration clause as a whole because it is so overrun by unconscionable terms. The Article explains why only the latter two options are consistent with Congressional intent and good public policy...|$|E

40|$|The Advertising Standards Authority‘s {{system of}} {{self-regulation}} compares favourably {{with that of}} similar bodies in many other countries. Its advertising code regulates, amongst others, offensive advertising. This study investigates whether the limitations imposed by the South African advertising code accord with {{the provisions of the}} South African Constitution. In order to examine this critically, an interpretative, comparative review of the literature on this topic was conducted. Offensive advertising is a form of freedom of expression that is protected in South Africa. It is accepted as such in constitutional jurisprudence, both in South Africa and internationally. The advertising code may therefore only limit advertising freedom insofar as the limitations of s 36 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 permit it. In terms of s 36, the South Africa advertising code needs to constitute a ‘law of general application’. As a contract between advertisers and the Advertising Standards Authority, and also based on the advertising code’s legal underpinning in broadcast advertising, the code is ‘law’. Moreover, as a published document based on international advertising principles, the code is furthermore also accessible; and it has general application. However, the vague terminology employed in the offensive advertising clause means that the clause constitutes an <b>unenforceable</b> <b>contract</b> term. It is not sufficiently clear and precise to qualify as ‘law of general application’, {{with the exception of the}} provisions on gender offence, the offensive advertising provisions are not formulated with sufficient precision so as to enable advertisers to reasonably ascertain prior to publication whether an advertisement is likely to be acceptable. The Constitutional Court in Islamic Unity Convention v Independent Broadcasting Authority NO 2002 (4) SA 294; 2002 (5) BCLR 433 para 30 highlighted the categories of offensive material that can be expected to be regulated in a democratic society, if fairness and a diversity of views representative of South African society is to be achieved, namely material that is (1) indecent, obscene or offensive to public morals; (2) offensive to religious convictions; or (3) offensive to feelings of sections of the population. The study concludes that in respect of sex, nudity, violence, and language, advertising material should be limited to appropriate media placement in that the South African advertising code should aim to protect children and unwilling adult recipients from offence occasioned by encountering such material, rather than preventing moral deterioration. The study also concludes that when dealing with religious convictions, race, sexual orientation, ethnic or social origin, age, disability, and culture, the prohibitions on advertising should mirror the provisions of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act (Act 4 of 2000), dealing with hate speech: If a category of offence is to be banned, such offence cannot be merely shocking but must result in hate speech. The Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act is a direct result of the requirement in the Constitution, 1996 that national legislation must be enacted to prevent or prohibit unfair discrimination. Finally, the study proposes amended provisions relating to offensive advertising for the South African advertising code: Firstly, it is proposes that an advertiser‘s freedom of expression should be curtailed in a manner that ensures fairness and a diversity of views broadly representing a democratic South African society. Secondly, the proposal aims to ensure that offensive advertising provisions accord with the value system of the Constitution, 1996, when collectively weighing up the requirements and factors provided for in s 36 of the Constitution, 1996, together with all other relevant factors.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this thesis {{considers}} a contractual principal-agent relationship in an unstable environment. The players are uncertain whether repeated interaction is possible. I examine {{the role that the}} deliberate choice of an incomplete (non-verifiable and <b>unenforceable)</b> <b>contract</b> plays in signalling stability and trust. In this model, contractors may privately observe shocks that force them to end the relationship after the current period. Complete (verifiable) contracts, which are assumed to be feasible, ensure cooperation in compliance with the contract. With incomplete contracts, the players make themselves vulnerable to exploitation by their partners. But if cooperation occurs notwithstanding, the contractors update their beliefs about each other’s willingness to interact again. When the agent observes that her partner and herself are able to continue the relationship, she undertakes a non-contractible, mutually beneficial investment. The second chapter is based on the theory by Hart and Moore (QJE, 2008) that regards contracts as reference points for feelings of entitlement. Parties’ ex post performance depends on whether they receive what they feel entitled to, which is assumed to be the best possible outcome permitted by the contract. Consequentially, there exists a trade-off between contractual flexibility (agreement on a price interval) and rigidity (agreement on a single price). Hart and Moore do not analyse the role that third party contract enforcement plays for parties’ feelings of entitlement, shading on performance and contract choice. I demonstrate that Hart and Moore’s results rely on a number of assumptions that can be challenged when incorporating litigation into the model. They assume that trade is voluntary but renegotiation is prohibited. I argue that either trade is voluntary but renegotiation is possible or courts compel parties to trade according to the contract. In the former scenario, fixed price contracts may not act as reference points and the parties feel entitled to the best possible outcomes from renegotiation. In the latter scenario, contracts may act as reference points because of the option of contract enforcement. However, potential flexibility incorporated in the contract is lost. The third chapter provides an experimental examination of the effect of contract enforcement on contractors’ reference points for feelings of entitlement. Previous experiments by Fehr, Hart and Zehnder (AER 2011) analyse and support the theory by Hart and Moore (QJE, 2008) that contracts are reference points. Both theory and experiments ignore the role of contract enforcement for contractors’ feelings of entitlement. I replicate and confirm Fehr, Hart and Zehnder’s baseline experiment. I also run an additional treatment in which buyers can offer sellers more or less favourable prices than specified in the contract, whereas sellers can request enforcement of contracts as written. I find that contract enforcement matters, without being invoked, for sellers’ punishment behaviour through feelings of entitlement. Without explicit contract enforcement, flexible contracts (agreement on a price range instead of a single price) leave sellers feel entitled to the best possible price permitted by the contract. However, buyers rarely offer such a price which leads to disappointment and punishment. With the option of contract enforcement, sellers feel entitled to the price which the court would enforce, even if it is equally unfavourable than in the no court treatment. The presence of the court provides an outside validation for which prices are reasonable and thereby limits disappointment and punishment...|$|E

40|$|Not only do Africa's fragile states {{grow more}} slowly than non-fragile states, {{but they seem to}} be caught in a"fragility trap". For instance, the {{probability}} that a fragile state in 2001 was still fragile in 2009 was 0. 95. This paper presents an economic model where three features [...] political instability and violence, insecure property rights and <b>unenforceable</b> <b>contracts,</b> and corruption [...] conspire to create a slow-growth-poor-governance equilibrium trap into which these fragile states can fall. The analysis shows that, by addressing the three problems, fragile countries can emerge from the fragility trap and enjoy a level of sustained economic growth. But addressing these issues requires resources, which are scarce because external aid is often tailored to the country's performance and cut back when there is instability, insecurity, and corruption. The implication is that, even if aid is seemingly unproductive in these weak-governance environments, it could be hugely beneficial if it is invested {{in such a way that}} it helps these countries tackle the root causes of instability, insecurity, and corruption. Empirical estimations corroborate the postulated relationships of the model, supporting the notion that it is possible for African fragile countries to avoid the fragility trap.

The book explains contract formation, interpretation, and the requirement of written evidence for enforcement of certain types of promises.

Chapters include all of the areas of contract law typically covered in the first-year course, including the bargained-for exchange, <b>unenforceable</b> <b>contracts,</b> performance and breach, obstacles to performance, modification, pre-contractual obligation, remedies and damages, and stakeholders other than contracting parties, including the third-party beneficiary doctrine, delegation and assignment. The organization of the book reflects the five sequential questions that frame the thought processes of lawyers and judges dealing with contracts issues. For example, before considering whether a party 2 ̆ 7 s conduct amounts to a breach, a judge would answer the question whether the parties had indeed formed a contract. In addition to explaining the major cases traditionally covered in contracts classes, the authors present common-sense examples and hypotheticals in order to link student intuitions about fairness and competition to the law of contracting.

50|$|The {{international}} intervention which {{culminated in}} renewed conflict in South Sudan is cited {{as an example}} of a flawed application of international state building. On July 9, 2011, with unilateral support from the United Nations Security Council and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the nation of South Sudan was officially recognized as an independent Sovereign, forged by an alliance of rebel groups. The process of building this state, however, began in 2005 with the proclamation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which was a militarist agreement forged among warlords to establish a military dictatorship in South Sudan. The process was conceptualized and facilitated by the United States, Britain, Norway, and the IGAD, as the solution to the ongoing Sudanese Civil War. The foundation of this agreement was an assumption that the terms of a peace agreement should be determined solely by military leaders. Later, in 2010, an attempt was made to include political leaders in the state building process through the All South Sudanese Political Parties convention, which ultimately resolved to create a transitional government with representation from all major political factions, with a goal of hosting free and fair elections within two years of independence. However, the transitional government never kept these terms, and South Sudan has since devolved into fierce ethnic conflict and civil war. Mahmood Mamdani asserts that this renewed violence was caused by the blatant disregard that South Sudan's rulers have shown for the peace treaties, due to a perception of reassurance through unconditional international support. The treaties have in effect become, as Jeffrey Herbst describes, <b>unenforceable</b> <b>contracts.</b>|$|R
