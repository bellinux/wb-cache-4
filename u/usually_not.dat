5|$|LGBT {{themes were}} found first in {{underground}} or alternative comics, often published by small independent presses or self-published. Such comics frequently advocated political positions and included depictions of sex, <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> intended solely to cause arousal but included {{as part of}} the exploration of themes including gender and sexuality.|$|E
5|$|T.chatareus {{are known}} to occur in shaded areas with {{vegetation}} overhead, usually at {{the top layer of}} the water column. They are found only where there is an intact riparian area, as this is a major source of their food. T.chatareus are <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> found in fast-flowing streams.|$|E

5|$|A {{midshipman}} in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) holds a commission, {{which is}} <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> issued until promotion to sub-lieutenant or lieutenant. Officer candidates enter the RAN at various ranks depending on previous experience or degree qualifications; graduates from a three-year course, non-degree qualified entrants, and sailor changeovers below {{the rank of}} leading seaman enter as midshipman.|$|E
5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50°. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm. From an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{attack and}} defend {{themselves}} by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or spraying chemicals, such as formic acid {{in the case}} of formicine ants, alkaloids and piperidines in fire ants, and a variety of protein components in other ants. Bullet ants (Paraponera), located in Central and South America, are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> fatal to humans. This sting is given the highest rating on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index.|$|E

5|$|At least 150 {{black women}} were lynched between 1880 and 1965 in the American South. Historian Kerry Segrave {{highlights}} 115 recorded cases between 1851 and 1946. Ninety of the 115 were black, 19 white, and six Hispanic or uncertain. Women were <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> lynched alone, but {{tended to be}} treated as accomplices of men who were being lynched. Of 97 incidents examined by Segrave, 36 were of women lynched alone.|$|E
5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI are <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk}} of blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms.|$|E
5|$|Collisions {{occur when}} two galaxies pass {{directly}} through {{each other and}} have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. The stars of interacting galaxies will <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> collide, but the gas and dust within the two forms will interact, sometimes triggering star formation. A collision can severely distort {{the shape of the}} galaxies, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.|$|E

5|$|Croup can {{be caused}} by a number of viruses {{including}} parainfluenza and influenza virus. Rarely is it due to a bacterial infection. Croup is typically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms after potentially more severe causes, such as epiglottitis or an airway foreign body, have been ruled out. Further investigations—such as blood tests, X-rays, and cultures—are <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> needed.|$|E
5|$|Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems {{in and around}} the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later point. If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> needed even if there are subsequent seizures.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana, known {{commonly}} as the Carolina {{false morel}} or big red, is an ascomycete fungus {{of the genus}} Gyromitra, within the Pezizales group of fungi. It is found in hardwood forests of the southeastern United States, where it fruits in early spring soon after snowmelt. Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the toxic compound gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the false morel G.esculenta, {{and for this reason}} it is <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> recommended for consumption.|$|E

5|$|Gyromitra esculenta has a {{wrinkled}} surface (similar to brainlike convolutions), not wavy or bumpy like G.infula. Gyromitra ambigua {{is very similar}} in appearance, and although it is <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> possible to discern between the two species without examining microscopic characteristics, G.ambigua {{is said to have}} more pronounced purple tints in the stipe. G.ambigua has larger spores that are about 22–30µm long. The saddle-shaped cap of G.infula might also lead to confusion with some species of Helvella, but these latter fungi typically have grayer colors and thinner, fluted stipes.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{the hunting}} {{is done by}} {{a select group of}} fishermen. When a pod of {{dolphins}} has been spotted, they're driven into a bay by the fishermen while banging on metal rods in the water to scare and confuse the dolphins. When the dolphins are in the bay, it is quickly closed off with nets so the dolphins cannot escape. The dolphins are <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> caught and killed immediately, but instead left to calm down over night. The following day, the dolphins are caught one by one and killed.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} borne {{in mind that}} the {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance. This is <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> true of the sections at either end, which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance. The further the section is {{from the end of the}} filter, the more accurate the prediction will become, since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the commercialization}} of the Monsanto process, most acetic acid was {{produced}} by oxidation of acetaldehyde. This remains the second-most-important manufacturing method, although it is <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> competitive with the carbonylation of methanol. The acetaldehyde can be produced by hydration of acetylene. This was the dominant technology in the early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs {{have been}} a staple of popular culture {{for as long as}} their cousins the dinosaurs, though they are <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> {{featured}} as prominently in films, literature or other art. Additionally, while the depiction of dinosaurs in popular media has changed radically in response to advances in paleontology, a mainly outdated picture of pterosaurs has persisted since the mid 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Rice is {{the basic}} {{ingredient}} in ceremonial dishes, and {{is a very important}} element of Palestinian meals. Rice dishes are usually the main dish of Palestinian dinner, because they consist of a variety of ingredients commonly found within the Palestinian land. Rice is <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> served alone or as a side dish (see ruz ma lahma below), but rather it is incorporated within a larger dish or tabeekh (dish), that would include soups, vegetables, and meat (chicken or lamb). Meat is almost always present in Palestinian dishes.|$|E
