40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{complete}} a six year natural weathering study {{on a series of}} geosynthetics an concurrently complete a 20, 000 hour accelerated weathering study. An energy equivalency method was used to establish a rough relationship of approximately 1000 hours of accelerated weathering being equal to one year of natural exposure. This relationship was seen to be consistent with the results of the natural and accelerated studies, as well as to other examples of such relationships in the literature. The 20, 000 hour accelerated exposure allowed us to compare the performance of highly UV resistant materials such as 1. 5 mm HDPE stabilized with carbon black, and thinner polyolefin geoemembranes stabilized with pigment and additional UV stabilizers. The results of our study suggest that a thinner (0. 75 mm) geomembrane can perform equivalently to a 1. 5 mm HDPE geomembrane when sufficient <b>UV</b> <b>stabilizing</b> additives are utilized...|$|R
40|$|Abstractp 53 is {{stabilized}} {{in response}} to DNA damaging stress. This stabilization is thought to result from phosphorylation in the N-terminus of p 53, which inhibits p 53 :MDM 2 binding, and prevents MDM 2 from promoting p 53 ubiquitination. In this report, the DNA alkylating agents mitomycin C (MMC) and methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), as well as <b>UV</b> radiation, <b>stabilized</b> p 53 in a manner independent of phosphorylation in p 53 N-terminus. This stabilization coincided with decreased levels of MDM 2 mRNA and protein, and a corresponding decrease in p 53 ubiquitination. Importantly, MDM 2 overexpression inhibited the stabilization of p 53 and decrease in ubiquitination following MMC, MMS, and UV treatment. This indicates that downregulation of MDM 2 contributes to the stabilization of p 53 {{in response to}} these agents...|$|R

40|$|Production of high {{strength}} carbon fibers from bio-derived precursors is of topical interest. Recently, we reported on dry-spinning of a partially acetylated softwood kraft lignin to produce carbon fibers with superior properties, but the thermo-oxidative stabilization step required {{a long time}} due to a slow heating rate needed to prevent the fibers from being heated too rapidly and sticking to each other. Here we report a rapid strategy of dual UV-thermoxidative stabilization (crosslinking) of dry-spun lignin fibers that significantly reduces the stabilization time. The fibers undergo reaction {{close to the surface}} such that they can be subsequently thermally stabilized at a rapid heating rate without fibers fusing together, which reduces the total stabilization time significantly from 40 to 4 h. Consequently, the glass transition temperature of UV irradiated fibers was about 15 °C higher than that of fibers without <b>UV</b> treatment. <b>Stabilized</b> fibers were successfully carbonized at 1000 °C and resulting carbon fibers displayed a tensile strength of 900 ± 100 MPa, which is amongst the highest reported for carbon fibers derived from softwood lignin-based precursors.

The pressure shift, owing to the high pressure buffer gas of the hollow-cathode lamp, was observed using an atomic beam resonance as reference. Such a shift was corrected by adjusting the peak ratio of the two Doppler-free saturation profiles resulted from two pumping beams with a 130 MHz frequency difference. The resulted frequency stability of the ultraviolet laser is ? 0. 5 MHz at 0. 1 sec integration time.

40|$|MTA 1 (metastasis-associated protein 1), an {{integral}} {{component of the}} nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex, has recently been implicated in the ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage response. However, whether MTA 1 also participates in the UV-induced DNA damage checkpoint pathway remains unknown. In response to UV radiation, ATR (ataxia teleangiectasia- and Rad 3 -related) is the major kinase activated that orchestrates cell cycle progression with DNA repair machinery by phosphorylating and activating a number of downstream substrates, such as Chk 1 (checkpoint kinase 1) and H 2 AX (histone 2 A variant X). Here, we report that <b>UV</b> radiation <b>stabilizes</b> MTA 1 in an ATR-dependent manner and increases MTA 1 binding to ATR. On the other hand, depletion of MTA 1 compromises the ATR-mediated Chk 1 activation following UV treatment, accompanied by a marked down-regulation of Chk 1 and its interacting partner Claspin, an adaptor protein that {{is required for the}} phosphorylation and activation of Chk 1 by ATR. Furthermore, MTA 1 deficiency decreases the induction of phosphorylated H 2 AX (referred to as γ-H 2 AX) and γ-H 2 AX focus formation after UV treatment. Consequently, depletion of MTA 1 results in a defect in the G 2 -M checkpoint and increases cellular sensitivity to UV-induced DNA damage. Thus, MTA 1 is required for the activation of the ATR-Claspin-Chk 1 and ATR-H 2 AX pathways following UV treatment, and the noted abrogation of the DNA damage checkpoint in the MTA 1 -depleted cells may be, at least in part, a consequence of dysregulation of the expression of these two pathways. These findings suggest that, in addition to its role in the repair of double strand breaks caused by ionizing radiation, MTA 1 also participates in the UV-induced ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint pathway...|$|R

50|$|Vegetable {{garden bed}} {{construction}} materials should be chosen carefully. Some concerns exist {{regarding the use}} of pressure-treated timber. Pine that was treated using chromated copper arsenate or CCA, a toxic chemical mix for preserving timber that may leach chemicals into the soil which in turn can be drawn up into the plants, is a concern for vegetable growers, where part or all of the plant is eaten. If using timber to raise the garden bed, ensure that it is an untreated hardwood to prevent the risk of chemicals leaching into the soil. A common approach is to use timber sleepers joined with steel rods to hold them together. Another approach is to use concrete blocks, although less aesthetically pleasing, they are inexpensive to source and easy to use. On the market are also prefab raised garden bed solutions which are made from long lasting polyethylene that is <b>UV</b> <b>stabilized</b> and food grade so it will not leach undesirable chemicals into the soil or deteriorate in the elements. A double skinned wall provides an air pocket of insulation that minimizes the temperature fluctuations and drying out of the soil in the garden bed.

There are variants of wood, metal, stone and plastic. Each material type has advantages and disadvantages.|$|E
50|$|AREs are {{recognized}} by RNA binding proteins such as tristetraprolin (TTP), AUF1, and Hu Antigen R (HuR). Although the exact mechanism {{is not very}} well understood, recent publications have attempted to propose the action {{of some of these}} proteins. AUF1, also known as hnRNP D, binds AREs through RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). AUF1 is also known to interact with the translation initiation factor eIF4G and with poly(A)-binding protein, indicating that AUF1 senses the translational status of mRNA and decays accordingly through the excision of the poly(A) tail.TTP’s expression is rapidly induced by insulin. Immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that TTP co-precipitates with an exosome, suggesting that it helps recruit exosomes to the mRNA containing AREs. Alternatively, HuR proteins have a stabilizing effect—their binding to AREs increases the half-life of mRNAs. Similar to other RNA-binding proteins, this class of proteins contain three RRMs, two of which are specific to ARE elements. A likely mechanism for HuR action relies on the idea that these proteins compete with other proteins that normally have a destabilizing effect on mRNAs. HuRs are involved in genotoxic response—they accumulate in the cytoplasm in response to <b>UV</b> exposure and <b>stabilize</b> mRNAs that encode proteins involved in DNA repair.|$|R
40|$|Silicon carbide {{rectifiers}} and MESFET switches are {{commercially available}} since 2001 and 2005 respectively. Moreover, three inch SiC wafers {{can be purchased}} nowadays without critical defects for the device performance, four inch wafers are available and the next step of technology is set to be the six inch substrate wafers. Despite this tremendous development in SiC technology the reliability issues, like bipolar device degradation, passivation, or low MOSFET channel mobility still remain to be solved. This thesis focuses on SiC surface passivation and junction termination, a topic which {{is very important for}} the utilisation of the full potential of this semiconductor. Five dielectrics with high dielectric constants, Al 2 O 3, AlN, AlON, HfO 2 and TiO 2 have been investigated. The layers were deposited directly on SiC, or on the thermally oxidized SiC surfaces with several different techniques. The structural and electrical properties of the dielectrics were measured and the best insulating layers were then deposited on fully processed and well characterised 1. 2 kV 4 H SiC PiN diodes. For the best Al 2 O 3 layers, the leakage current was reduced to half its value and the breakdown voltage was extended by 0. 7 kV, reaching 1. 6 kV, compared to non passivated devices. Furthermore, AlON deposited on 4 H SiC at room temperature provided interface quality comparable to that obtained with the thermally grown SiO 2 /SiC system. As important as the proper choice of dielectric material is a proper surface preparation prior to deposition of the insulator. In the thesis two surface treatments were tested, a standard HF termination used in silicon technology and an exposure to UV light from a mercury or deuterium lamp. The second technique is highly interesting since a substantial improvement was observed when UV light was used prior to the dielectric deposition. Moreover, <b>UV</b> light <b>stabilized</b> the surface and reduced the leakage current by a factor of 100 for SiC devices after 10 Mrad γ ray exposition. The experiments show also that the measured leakage currents of the order of pA are dominated by surface leakage. QC 2010092...|$|R

This thesis investigates the redox processes of aqueous uranium (uranyl) in order to understand and predict its behavior in the environment. In addition, the behavior of the UO 2 -HfO 2 solid-solution (Hf being a neutron absorber) is modeled to study the conditions under which the mixture forms a solid solution or exsolves, which is essential for its in-reactor performance. Soluble uranyl(VI) can be reduced on surfaces of Fe(II) -bearing minerals to solid U(IV) O 2, resulting in the decrease of its mobility in the environment. However, the previously considered one-step two-electron reduction pathway from U(VI) to U(IV) has been challenged by the presence of stable pentavalent U(V). The experiments here investigate the mechanism of uranium reduction by reducing uranyl(VI) electrochemically on powdered and bulk magnetite electrodes. The number of electrons transferred per redox change is found to be one, which confirms the one-electron reduction from U(VI) to U(V).

For that purpose, both model systems and commercially available greenhouse films of PE-LD, blended with different UV-stabilisers (HALS), were provided by different industrial partners. The polyethylene films were subjected to different accelerating artificial weathering methods and natural weathering in Jacksonville, Florida. To characterize the photo-ageing process both surface analytical methods, like microscopy, and spectroscopic methods, like FTIR, UV, and chemiluminescence were used. The mechanical properties of the films were measured by means of tensile tests. It could be shown that the presence of acid precipitation during weathering accelerates the degradation of mechanical stability and therewith accelerates the photochemical ageing of the material. It was proved, that a shortening of lifetime results therefore. The extent of the shortening of lifetime is influenced both by the kind and by the concentration of the HALS-stabiliser. A procedure of artificial weathering (ADF test) was optimised for the material polyethylene and proved to be a suitable laboratory method to simulate the synergistic effect of climatic parameters and acid precipitation, which occur in Mediterranean countries.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) was {{established}} in 1963 primarily to provide rocket engine testing services for several NASA programs. The groundwater underlying the site has been contaminated {{as a result of}} historical operations. Groundwater contaminants include several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and two semi-volatile compounds: N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrodimethylamine (DMN). This paper discusses some of the technical, analytical, regulatory, and health risk issues associated with the contaminant plume. The plume has moved approximately 2. 5 miles downgradient of the facility industrial boundary, with evidence of continued migration. As a result, NASA has proposed a pump and treat system using air strippers and ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> oxidation to <b>stabilize</b> future movement of the contaminant plume. The system has been designed to treat 1, 076 gallons (4, 073 liters) per minute, with provisions for future expansion. The UV oxidation process was selected to treat NDMA-contaminated groundwater based on successes at other NDMA-contaminated sites. Bench- and pilot-scale testing of WSTF groundwater confirmed the ability of UV oxidation to destroy NDMA and generated sufficient data to design the proposed full-scale treatment system. NDMA is acutely toxic and is a probable human carcinogen. EPA-recommended health risk criteria for the residential consumption of NDMA/DMN-contaminated groundwater was used to determine that a 1. 0 x 10 (exp - 6) excess cancer risk corresponds to 1. 7 parts per trillion (ppt). EPA analytical methods are unable to detect NDMA and DMN in the low ppt range. EPA's current Appendix IX analytical method used to screen for NDMA, Method 8270, can detect NDMA only at levels that are orders of magnitude greater than the recommended health risk level. Additionally, EPA Method 607, the most sensitive EPA approved method, has a detection limit of 150 ppt. This corresponds to an excess cancer risk of 9. 0 x 10 (exp - 5), which exceeds the State of New Mexico's water quality standard of a cancer risk less than 1 x 10 (exp - 5). The treatment system has been engineered to treat contaminated groundwater to levels significantly below the New Mexico standard. However, the inability of EPA-approved analytical methods to detect NDMA and DMN at low ppt levels, and to provide verification of compliance with the 1 x 10 (exp - 5) cancer risk, introduces a notable risk to the long-term operation of the system. WSTF has been working with Southwest Research Institute to develop a non-EPA analytical method that can achieve a reporting limit of 1 ppt, which corresponds to an excess cancer risk of 7. 6 x 10 (exp - 7).

While non-stabilized ABS samples loose the butadiene component in the first 22 h of exposure, in stabilized samples submitted to same accelerated conditions this component only disappears after 150 h of exposure.

The exper-imental results shown that the optical efficiency obtained from the 3 D CPC (0 · 626) was significantly higher than that of the 2 D CPC (0 · 570) of similar dimensions. Since the optical efficiency of the 3 D CPC was increased, the thermal efficiency of the collector was also increased. In addition to that, time constant of the concen-trator was also calculated. The time constant of the 3 D CPC (431 s) was fairly high when compared with the 2 D CPC (110 s). An attempt was made to generate low pressure steam using 3 D CPC in the in situ steam generation mode.

Polyethylene type of plastic film which has a specific of 110 μm of film, one year life, Ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>stabilized,</b> infrared modified and anti-drop, will be tested for the influence of accumulation of dust and dirt on their solar radiation transmissivity. The above specimen is placed on an experimental model greenhouse which is erected in an open area at the Institute of Agricultural Engineering, Israel, for 6 months and removes for testing the transmisivity of the materials. Five treatments includes new material, six moths dirty material, air jet cleaning, water jet cleaning, and hand washing will be measured using a Licor spectroradiometer (Li 1800). The results found that the average light transmissivity of new film is about 86 %. Before cleaning the film, the average loss in transmission for a period of the 6 months, is decreased about 50 % to 36 % of light transmissivity. However, after cleaning the film, the average of light transmissivity is about 85 % and that meant transmission loss is only 1 % in 6 month. Comparison of different methods of cleaning the screens reveled that using air jet only for cleaning the screens, hardly, improves their transmissivity while cleaning them with water jet improve their transmissivity drastically...|$|E
