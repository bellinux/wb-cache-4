5|$|The Marlins and Rockies {{used the}} {{expansion}} draft {{to build their}} teams <b>using</b> <b>different</b> strategies. As the Rockies had a smaller operating budget than the Marlins, the Rockies targeted prospects with low salaries, while the Marlins selected older players intended to provide more immediate impact. All three rounds of the draft were televised by ESPN.|$|E

30|$|The {{published}} studies <b>used</b> <b>different</b> self-monitoring scales, different clinical rating scales, different definitions of affective states, applied different duration criteria for affective states, and <b>used</b> <b>different</b> diagnostic systems (DSM-IV, ICD- 10). Thus, {{this makes it}} difficult to compare results across studies.|$|R
25|$|Different taekwondo {{styles and}} {{associations}} (ATA, ITF, GTF, WT, etc.) <b>use</b> <b>different</b> taekwondo forms. Even {{within a single}} association, different schools in the association may <b>use</b> slightly <b>different</b> variations on the forms, or <b>use</b> <b>different</b> names for the same form (especially in older styles of taekwondo). This {{is especially true for}} beginner forms, which tend to be less standardized than mainstream forms.|$|R
5|$|Animals {{including}} {{birds and}} turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, {{and use the}} field to navigate during migration. Some {{researchers have found that}} cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible. Other researchers reported in 2011 that they could not replicate those findings <b>using</b> <b>different</b> Google Earth images.|$|E
5|$|During April 1864, the {{regiment}} {{became part of}} the 1st Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of West Virginia. General Crook returned to West Virginia to command the Army's infantry. General Averell became commander of the cavalry. On April 30, Crook and Averell departed Charleston for Virginia, <b>using</b> <b>different</b> routes, as part of a plan to attack the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. The salt mine and lead mine located along the railroad were also targets.|$|E
5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, {{and asked if he}} could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate the sound of a choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times <b>using</b> <b>different</b> voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself sound like a woman.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to exhibitions of the Four Freedoms by Rockwell, {{there have been}} tribute exhibitions of works by other artists depicting these themes. For example, in 2008 at the Wolfsonian museum at Florida International University, 60 artists exhibited 80 works that represented their takes on the Four Freedoms. Other artists, such as Thomas Kinkade, have found individual inspiration in Rockwell's patriotic works, resulting in their own works <b>using</b> <b>different</b> symbols to present similar themes.|$|E
5|$|Pigeonhole sort, {{counting}} sort, radix sort, and Van Emde Boas tree sorting {{all work}} best when the key size is small; for large enough keys, they become slower than comparison sorting algorithms. However, when the key size or the word size is very large {{relative to the}} number of items (or equivalently when the number of items is small), it may again become possible to sort quickly, <b>using</b> <b>different</b> algorithms that take advantage of the parallelism inherent in the ability to perform arithmetic operations on large words.|$|E
5|$|The Cow Tower is an {{artillery}} tower by the River Wensum in Norwich, Norfolk, England. Built between 1398 and 1399 {{by the city}} authorities {{in response to the}} threat from France and indigenous English rebels, the tower was intended to defend the north-eastern approach to Norwich with hand cannons and bombards. It stood apart from the main city walls, close to the river where its height would have allowed it to fire onto the higher ground opposite the city. The tower was designed to hold a garrison when required and was well furnished, probably <b>using</b> <b>different</b> floors for dining and sleeping.|$|E

50|$|For example, Compact Disc Digital Audio and Digital Audio Tape systems <b>use</b> <b>different</b> {{sampling}} rates, and American television, European television, {{and movies}} all <b>use</b> <b>different</b> frame rates. Sample rate conversion prevents changes in speed and pitch {{that would otherwise}} occur when transferring recorded material between such systems.|$|R
5|$|The {{sex ratio}} of male to female dragonflies varies both {{temporally}} and spatially. Adult dragonflies {{have a high}} male-biased ratio at breeding habitats. The male-bias ratio has contributed partially to the females <b>using</b> <b>different</b> habitats to avoid male harassment. As seen in Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana), male populations use wetland habitats, while females use dry meadows and marginal breeding habitats, only migrating to the wetlands to lay their eggs or to find mating partners. Unwanted mating is energetically costly for females because it affects {{the amount of time}} that they are able to spend foraging.|$|E
5|$|The studio {{efforts on}} The Beatles {{captured}} {{the work of}} four increasingly individuated artists who frequently found themselves at odds. Lewisohn notes that several backing tracks do not feature the full group, and overdubs tended {{to be limited to}} whoever wrote the song. Sometimes McCartney and Lennon would record simultaneously in different studios, each <b>using</b> <b>different</b> engineers. Late in the sessions, Martin, whose influence over the band had waned, spontaneously left to go on holiday, leaving Chris Thomas in charge of production. Lennon's devotion to Ono over the other Beatles, and the pair's addiction to heroin, made working conditions difficult as he became prone to bouts of temper.|$|E
5|$|The {{travel times}} {{are not the}} same, which should be {{indicated}} by an interference shift. However, if Fresnel's dragging coefficient {{is applied to the}} water in the aether frame, the travel time difference (to first order in v/c) vanishes. <b>Using</b> <b>different</b> setups Hoek actually obtained a null result, confirming Fresnel's dragging coefficient. (For a similar experiment refuting the possibility of shielding the aether wind, see Hammar experiment).|$|E

5|$|Before {{receiving}} the French intelligence material, Rejewski {{had made a}} careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each message was encrypted <b>using</b> <b>different</b> starting positions of the rotors, as selected by the operator. This message setting was three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the message by sending the message setting in a disguised form â€” a six-letter indicator. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set to a common global setting for that day, termed the ground setting, which was shared by all operators. The particular way that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.|$|E
5|$|Citizen Kane eschews the {{traditional}} linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback <b>using</b> <b>different</b> points of view, {{many of them}} from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the unreliable narrator in literature. Welles also dispenses {{with the idea of}} a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, as {{elsewhere}} in the world of European colonies, the frontier of European exploration and settlement tended to be a linguistically diverse and fluid place, as cultures <b>using</b> <b>different</b> languages met and interacted. The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade, and (in some cases) intermarriage, {{led to the development of}} Mixed languages. Languages like Michif, Chinook Jargon and Bungi creole tended to be highly localized and were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable of speaking another language. Plains Sign Talk, which functioned originally as a trade language used to communicate internationally and across linguistic borders, reached across Canada, the United States and into Mexico.|$|E
