25|$|In {{the context}} of the World Wide Web, a {{bookmark}} is a <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Identifier</b> (URI) that is stored for later retrieval in any of various storage formats. All modern web browsers include bookmark features. Bookmarks are called favorites or Internet shortcuts in Internet Explorer, and by virtue of that browser's large market share, these terms have been synonymous with bookmark since the first browser war. Bookmarks are normally accessed through a menu in the user's web browser, and folders are commonly used for organization. In addition to bookmarking methods within most browsers, many external applications offer bookmark management.|$|E

Resources indicated by blank nodes are called anonymous resources. They are not directly identifiable from the RDF statement. The predicate is a URI which also indicates a resource, representing a relationship. The object is a URI, blank node or a Unicode string literal.|$|E

For URNs to be meaningful, they must be mapped to a concrete resource of some sort. <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> Locators (URLs) are often used to describe such resources, such as a computer hostname, or a local file.|$|R
50|$|Domain {{names are}} also used as simple {{identification}} labels to indicate ownership or control of a resource.
