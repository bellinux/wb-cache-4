40|$|In this paper, we {{test the}} {{discrepancy}} between the stellar <b>mass</b> <b>density</b> and instantaneous star formation rate in redshift range 0 <z< 8 using a large observational data sample. We first compile the measurements of the stellar <b>mass</b> <b>densities</b> up to z∼ 8. Comparing the observed stellar <b>mass</b> <b>densities</b> with the time-integral of instantaneous star formation history, we find that the observed stellar <b>mass</b> <b>densities</b> are lower than that implied from star formation history at z< 4. We also use Markov chain monte carlo method to derive the best-fitting star formation history from the observed stellar <b>mass</b> <b>density</b> data. At 0. 5 <z< 6, the observed star formation rate densities are larger than the best-fitting one, especially at z∼ 2 where by a factor of about two. However, at lower (z 6), the derived star formation history is consistent with the observations. This is the first time to test {{the discrepancy between}} the observed stellar <b>mass</b> <b>density</b> and instantaneous star formation rate up to very high redshift z≈ 8 using the Markov chain monte carlo method and a varying recycling factor. Several possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed, such as underestimation of stellar <b>mass</b> <b>density,</b> initial <b>mass</b> function and cosmic metallicity evolution.

The radar operated continuously during this period but only measurements close to local midnight are used for comparison, to coincide with the local time of the measurements of ice <b>mass</b> <b>density.</b> The radar location is at high geographic latitude but low geomagnetic latitude (61 °) and the measurements were made during a period of very low solar activity. As a result, background electron densities can be modelled based on solar illumination alone. We find a close correlation between the time and height variations of radar reflectivity and ice <b>mass</b> <b>density,</b> at all PMSE heights, from 80 km up to 95 km. A quantitative expression relating radar reflectivities to ice <b>mass</b> <b>density</b> is found, including an empirical dependence on background electron density.
