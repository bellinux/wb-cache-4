50|$|World War II (1939-1945) {{resulted}} in an unprecedented scale of destruction of lives (over 60 million dead, most of them civilians), {{and the use of}} weapons of mass destruction. Some of the acts committed against civilians during the war were on such a massive scale of savagery, they came to be widely considered as crimes against humanity itself. As the war's conclusion drew near, many shocked voices called for the establishment of institutions able to permanently prevent deadly international conflicts. This led to the founding of the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> in 1945, which adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Many, however, felt that the UN, essentially a forum for discussion and coordination between sovereign governments, was insufficiently empowered for the task. A number of prominent persons, such as Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill, Bertrand Russell and Mohandas K. Gandhi, called on governments to proceed further by taking gradual steps towards forming an effectual federal world government. The <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>main</b> goal is to work on international law, international security, economic development, human rights, social progress, and eventually world peace. The <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> replaced the League of Nations in 1945, after World War II.

Justice, democracy and the rule of law are the pillars of sustainable peace by guaranteeing fundamental freedoms and human rights.

40|$|For {{some time}} now, {{the problem of}} an {{inadequate}} response to the humanitarian crisis {{around the world to}} protect human populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity has persisted. It was against the significant legal difficulties, and challenges of humanitarian intervention as illustrated above, that it was argued that there was a need for an to efficient way to respond to the on-going humanitarian crises thus the introduction of the "Responsibility to Protect idea. " The study has briefly touched on the creation, development and eventual adoption of the responsibility to protect (R 2 P) norm and more specifically. The {{purpose of this study is}} to critically examine the Nations Security Council's responsibility with regards to protection civilians from mass atrocities in light of the 2011 Syrian crisis. This is premised especially from pillar three of R 2 P which states that; "the international community has a responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other means to protect populations from these crimes. If a State is manifestly failing to protect its populations, the international community must be prepared to take collective action to protect populations, in accordance with the Charter of the <b>United</b> <b>Nations.</b> " The <b>main</b> question of this study is to analyse whether the responsibility to protect doctrine establishes a legal obligation on the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> Security Council to act in situations of mass atrocities such the case of Syria? The study has argued that much as the responsibility to protect doctrine neither establishes nor supports the idea that the Security Council is under a legal obligation to act when there is occurrence of humanitarian crisis, however, I have argued that article 24 together with other articles in the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> Charter create a legal obligation on the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> Security Council to act.
