5|$|At 00:30 {{hours on}} 28 March the convoy {{crossed over the}} shoals {{at the mouth of}} the Loire estuary, with Campbeltown {{scraping}} the bottom twice. Each time she was able to pull free, and the group proceeded on <b>up</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> harbour in darkness. They had got to within about eight minutes passage from the dock gates when at 01:22 the entire convoy was illuminated by the combined searchlights of both banks of the estuary. A naval signal light demanded their identification.|$|E
5|$|During the Sun Dance, {{which is}} practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the eagle is {{represented}} in several ways. The eagle nest {{is represented by the}} fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used {{during the course of the}} dance. Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held <b>up</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.|$|E
5|$|Specialised armour {{arriving}} in the first wave included AVREs, mine flails, and armoured bulldozers. Clearing paths off the beach proved difficult, as the tanks got stuck in the mud or were taken out by mines. A lone mine flail tank finally cleared a path from the beach <b>up</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Mont Fleury Battery and Ver-Sur-Mer. This route {{was used by the}} Green Howards and tanks of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards, who cleared the remaining resistance at the Mont Fleury Battery. B Company moved on to attack trench positions and machine gun emplacements at Meuvaines Ridge, while C Company moved to the west of Ver-Sur-Mer to help cover the assault on Crépon, where roads led to the important targets of Bayeux and Caen. The 7th Green Howards attacked the gun battery at Ver-Sur-Mer, where they took 50 prisoners. Colour Sergeant-Major Stanley Hollis earned the only Victoria Cross to be bestowed for actions on D-Day. On the way to the Mont Fleury Battery, Hollis came under machine gun fire while investigating a pillbox, so he shot into the entrance with his Sten gun and dropped a grenade through the roof, killing most of the occupants. He cleared a nearby trench of enemy soldiers, whereupon the occupants of a second pillbox surrendered. Later in the day, he saved the lives of three men during an attempt to take out a field artillery installation at a farm near Crépon.|$|E

5|$|The realistic-looking {{effects of}} the astronauts {{floating}} weightless in space and inside the spacecraft were accomplished by suspending the actors from wires attached {{to the top of}} the set, and placing the camera underneath them. The actors' bodies blocked the camera's view of the suspension wires, creating a very believable appearance of floating. For the shot of Poole floating into the pod's arms during Bowman's rescue attempt, a stuntman replaced a dummy on the wire to realistically portray the movements of an unconscious human, and was shot in slow motion to enhance the illusion of drifting through space. The scene showing Bowman entering the emergency airlock from the E.V.A. pod was done in a similar way: an off-camera stagehand, standing on a platform, held the wire suspending Dullea above the camera positioned at the bottom of the vertically configured airlock. At the proper moment, the stagehand first loosened his grip on the wire, causing Dullea to fall toward the camera, then, while holding the wire firmly, he jumped off the platform, causing Dullea to ascend back <b>up</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> hatch.|$|E
25|$|The cremasteric {{muscle is}} part of the spermatic cord. When this muscle contracts, the cord is {{shortened}} and the testicle is moved closer <b>up</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> body, which provides slightly more warmth to maintain optimal testicular temperature. When cooling is required, the cremasteric muscle relaxes and the testicle is lowered away from the warm body and is able to cool. Contraction also occurs in response to stress (the testicles rise <b>up</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> body in an effort to protect them in a fight). There are persistent reports that relaxation indicates approach of orgasm. There is a noticeable tendency to also retract during orgasm.|$|E

25|$|Another type of pass is the bounce pass. Here, the passer bounces {{the ball}} crisply {{about two-thirds of}} the way from his own chest to the receiver. The ball strikes the court and bounces <b>up</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> receiver. The bounce pass takes longer to {{complete}} than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation). Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender.|$|E

Coming <b>up</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> works, Devin's entire division, mostly dismounted, skirmished with portions of Heth's, Johnson's and Pickett's infantry. About 10:00p.m., Devin was ordered to pull back to Jetersville and he led his men to that point after burning a nearby mill.|$|E
25|$|For the {{observer}} {{standing on the}} platform, on the other hand, {{the rear of the}} traincar is moving (catching <b>up)</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> point at which the flash was given off, and the front of the traincar is moving away from it. As the speed of light is finite and the same in all directions for all observers, the light headed for the back of the train will have less distance to cover than the light headed for the front. Thus, the flashes of light will strike the ends of the traincar at different times.|$|E

25|$|The cell {{achieves}} {{its height}} {{in the water}} column by synthesising gas vesicles. As the cell rises up, it is able to increase its carbohydrate load through increased photosynthesis. Too high and the cell will suffer photobleaching and possible death, however, the carbohydrate produced during photosynthesis increases the cell's density, causing it to sink. The daily cycle of carbohydrate build-up from photosynthesis and carbohydrate catabolism during dark hours is enough to fine-tune the cell's position {{in the water column}}, bring it <b>up</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> surface when its carbohydrate levels are low and it needs to photosynthesis, and allowing it to sink away from the harmful UV radiation when the cell's carbohydrate levels have been replenished. An extreme excess of carbohydrate causes a significant change in the internal pressure of the cell, which causes the gas vesicles to buckle and collapse and the cell to sink out.|$|E
25|$|A {{suspended}} Slinky's {{centre of}} mass is accelerating downward at 16 feet per second (i.e. g); when released - the lower portion moves <b>up</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> top portion with an equivalent, constant upward acceleration as the tension is relieved. As the spring contracts, every point along its length will accelerate downward with gravity and tension, and experience a decrease in overall downward acceleration related to height along the spring due to the spring force changing with extension- {{at the bottom of}} the spring the upward initial acceleration reduces in accordance with Hooke's law as the spring contracts, but the centre toward which it is moving gets closer- meaning the base will have been displaced sufficiently toward the centre of inertial mass for it to appear to have hung still. Should this phenomenology extend to very light strings with heavy suspended masses (which have approximately linear tension distributions), different mathematics would be needed to explain the phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|Rosendale's Episcopal church, the All Saints' Chapel, {{was built}} in 1876.

The building was severely damaged by a fire on January15, 1975, but was restored, and a new wing was added; the wing was named after Anna Mae Auchmoedy, the building's first librarian. In 1986, the library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

500|$|The {{indifference}} of {{the natural}} world is a reoccurring theme in Crane's work. At the beginning of the novel, as the regiments advance toward battle, the sky is described as being an innocuous [...] "fairy blue." [...] In chapter seven, Henry notes the inexplicable tranquility of nature, [...] "a woman with a deep aversion to tragedy", even as the battle rages on. Similarly, Heaven itself is indifferent to the slaughter he encounters on the battlefield. The dichotomy between nature's sweetness and war's destructiveness is further described in chapter eighteen: [...] "A cloud of dark smoke as from smoldering ruins went <b>up</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sun now bright and gay in the blue, enameled sky." [...] After his desertion, however, Henry finds some comfort in the laws of nature, which seem to briefly affirm his previous cowardice: ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of Irish phonology is that almost all consonants come in pairs, with one having a [...] "broad" [...] pronunciation and the other a [...] "slender" [...] one. Broad consonants are either velarized (that is, the back of the tongue is pulled back and slightly up {{in the direction of the}} soft palate while the consonant is being articulated) or simply velar (e.g. [...] ). Slender consonants are palatalized, which means the tongue is pushed <b>up</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> hard palate during the articulation. The contrast between broad and slender consonants is crucial in Irish, because the meaning of a word can change if a broad consonant is substituted for a slender consonant or vice versa. For example, the only difference in pronunciation between the words [...] ('cow') and [...] ('alive') is that [...] is pronounced with a broad b sound, while [...] is pronounced with a slender b sound. The contrast between broad and slender consonants plays a critical role not only in distinguishing the individual consonants themselves, but also in the pronunciation of the surrounding vowels, in the determination of which consonants can stand next to which other consonants, and in the behavior of words that begin with a vowel. This broad/slender distinction is similar to the hard/soft one of several Slavic languages, like Russian.|$|E
