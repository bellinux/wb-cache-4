500|$|The Delaware General Assembly {{approved}} a state-aid road law in 1903, {{but the law}} was repealed in 1905. Instead, the driving force {{for the construction of}} what became the Delaware portion of US 113 was Thomas Coleman DuPont, who offered to fund and construct a modern highway from Selbyville to Wilmington as a philanthropic measure. Inspired by the great boulevards of Europe and cognizant of the need for a main northâ€“south highway as the backbone of a well-laid-out system of roads in Delaware, DuPont envisioned a [...] right-of-way that contained a [...] high-speed automobile highway flanked by dual trolley tracks, roadways for heavy vehicle traffic, unpaved roadways for horses above buried utility lines, and sidewalks at {{the outer edge of the}} right-of-way. The construction costs of the road would be recovered by trolley franchises and <b>utility</b> <b>line</b> rentals. After sections of the highway were built, they would be turned over without charge to the state, which would maintain the road.|$|E
