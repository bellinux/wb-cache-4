5000|$|Low {{carbon steel}} {{generally}} exhibits a very linear stress-strain relationship up to a well defined yield point (Fig.2). The linear {{portion of the}} curve is the elastic region and the slope is the modulus of elasticity or Young's Modulus ( [...] Young's Modulus is {{the ratio of the}} compressive stress to the longitudinal strain).Many ductile materials including some metals, polymers and ceramics exhibit a yield point. Plastic flow initiates at the <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> and continues at the lower one. At lower yield point, permanent deformation is heterogeneously distributed along the sample. The deformation band which formed at the <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> will propagate along the gage length at the lower yield point. The band occupies the whole of the gage at the luders strain. Beyond this point, work hardening commences. The appearance of the yield point is associated with pinning of dislocations in the system. Specifically, solid solution interacts with dislocations and acts as pin and prevent dislocation from moving. Therefore, the stress needed to initiate the movement will be large. As long as the dislocation escape from the pinning, stress needed to continue it is less.|$|E

Static load tests, constant strain-rate tests and square wave rapid loading tests were conducted on single crystal. and polycrystalline specimens {{in order to determine the}} dislocation configurations at various stages in the yielding process. An electrolytic etching technique was used to reveal dislocation intersections with the observation surface.

Moreover, APT showed that the carbon content of polygonal ferrite in the DP steel was higher than in the TRIP steel.

It was found for both steels that the BH behavior depends on the dislocation rearrangement in ferrite with the formation of cell, microbands, and shear band structures after PS.

The ADIF investigation of the closed hysteresis loop "loading-unloading" shows the dependence of its width from the hydrogen content which evidences the fact of dislocation unpinning from hydrogen atmospheres in the 1 / 2 cycle of loading.

Steel specimens of five grain sizes were produced for testing. The average grain diameter of these specimens ranged from 1. 1 x 10 (- 3) in. to 8. 1 x 10 (- 3) in. Two types of tensile tests were performed, one by the application of very low loading rates and the other by the rapid application of a constant stress. Both types of tests were performed at temperatures of 72 °F and - 320 °F, while a few rapid loading tests were performed at a temperature of - 109 °F. Both the static <b>upper</b> and lower <b>yield</b> <b>points</b> are observed to increase linearly with [ [...] . ], where d equals the average grain diameter.

40|$|The brittle-to-ductile {{transition}} (BDT) in silicon {{has been}} studied extensively {{over the last two}} decades, leading to the development of several theories to explain the observed characteristics of the transition. However to date, most of the experiments have been conducted on notched or pre-cracked samples because it is widely believed that the BDT results from some crack-tip phenomenon. We believe that the BDT occurs when a critical combination of stress and temperature results in the generation of an avalanche of dislocations in the material, permitting general yielding. In this view, a crack-tip is not necessary for the transition but it may serve as the stress concentrator that precipitates the avalanche of dislocations. To test this hypothesis, a new method of sample preparation using photolithography was developed. This process facilitated the production {{of a large number of}} uniform, dislocation-free, notch-free silicon specimens. These silicon beams were tested in bending at various elevated temperatures and strain-rates. These experiments reveal that a strain-rate dependent brittle-to-ductile transition does occur in these defect-free samples. In addition, the large number of uniform test specimens allowed the characteristics of the transition region to be probed in greater detail than previously possible. These tests reveal a deviation from the expected <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> behavior that coincides with the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature (BDTT) and may be related to the sudden generation of dislocations. This prompted an investigation of dislocation sources using dislocation etch-pit analysis. The etched sample surfaces show that massive dislocation activity occurs prior to yielding in the highest stressed portions of the beam. In addition, the scanning electron microscope images reveal a qualitative increase in dislocation activity above the BDTT, in agreement with the observed <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> behavior. Collectively, these observations necessitate a reevaluation of the theoretical treatment of the BDT. In particular, the observed massive dislocation activity associated with the yielding of the initially dislocation-free samples, must be taken into account. The Khantha-Pope-Vitek model of the BDT is proposed to address these new observations. ...|$|E

Three assumptions used are (a) no dislocation motion occurs below a critical resolved shear stress, (b) the yielding rate is dependent upon the velocity of mobile dislocations, and (c) the end of the delay period occurs when yielding of the grains has spread continuously through the thickness of the specimen. This model is consistent with the experimental observations and explains the true static <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> and the shape of the strain vs. time curve at constant applied stress.

Surface examination indicated that kinking had occurred and the crystallographic axes had rotated by ∼ 25 ° relative to the matrix crystal.

40|$|The {{physical}} mechanisms {{controlling the}} pre-failure stress-strain behavior of frozen sands are investigated in triaxial compression. The pre-failure, or small strain behavior (Ea<l%), {{is represented by}} the initial stiffness (Young's modulus) and the <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> stress, a very distinctive <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> representing the onset of large unrecoverable plastic strains. An extensive experimental program was conducted on a number of ice-saturated particulate systems to investigate the dependency of these two parameters on volume fraction, stress level, strain rate, and temperature, as well as on particle size, stiffness, roughness, shape, and interfacial bond strength. Theories for composite material behavior are employed to analyze the observed stress-strain-time-temperature behavior. The stress-strain behavior has been measured in a high-pressure, low-temperature automated triaxial compression testing system. Strain was evaluated using a novel on-specimen measurement device capable of consistently resolving displacements of less than 0. 1 microns, corresponding to strains of less than 0. 0002 % for specimens measuring 3. 6 cm x 7. 6 cm. Very precise temperature and strain rate control systems contributed to the reliability of the small strain measurements at confining pressures up to 10 MPa. Experimental findings show that the Young's modulus of frozen soils varies significantly with particle modulus and increases slightly with particle volume fraction, but does not change with strain rate and temperature. The development of stiffness, however, relies heavily on the extent of coupling between phases for the effective transfer of shear stress. This coupling can take the form of an adhesional bond or a frictional bond. In natural sand systems, shear stress is transferred through surface roughness and particle angularity and consequently the presence of an adhesional bond is not important. However, adhesional bonding is much more important in systems composed of smooth spherical particles. Application of reinforcement theories for two-phase particulate composites has led to a new approach for predicting the Young's modulus of frozen sand. The <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> stress behavior is controlled primarily by strain rate, temperature, and particle grain size, and for fully-bonded materials, is essentially independent of particle volume fraction and stress level. In the absence of an adhesional bond, however, the degree of surface roughness and stress level affect the <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> stress of the system, showing the importance of coupling in this region as well. The qualitative behavior of the <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> stress relative to polycrystalline ice can be explained by examining the influence of ice-particle interaction on the nature of cracks propagating through the ice matrix. by Gregory Da Re.

In addition, positive y-axis intercepts were observed in plots of Delta sigma(sub u) versus t(exp 2 / 3) suggesting the operation of a Snoek mechanism. Analysis according to the Cottrell Bilby model of atmosphere formation around dislocations yields an activation energy for yield point return in the range 70 to 76 kJ/mol which is comparable to the activation energy for diffusion of interstitial impurities in bcc metals.

40|$|A {{survey is}} {{presented}} of earlier investigations concerning {{the effect of}} temperature on the static and dynamic strength properties of iron and steel. Results are given of static and dynamic tests performed on a medium-carbon steel at temperatures ranging from + 15 °C to - 183 °C. Also investigated {{is the effect of}} various amounts of permanent dynamic strain on the subsequent static and dynamic properties of the steel. A correlation {{of the results of the}} above tests with the various mechanisms of deformation is permitted by photomicrographic examination of the tested specimens. Finally the results of the dynamic tests are compared with a delay-time theory. In order to be able to measure the true specimen strains in the low temperature static tests, a low temperature strain gauge was developed. This gauge, which incorporates wire resistance strain gauges, was used to find static stress-strain curves at a number of temperatures. From the variation of static upper yield stress with test temperature an estimate of σ 0, the yield stress at absolute zero, is obtained. This value of σ 0 is used in comparing the results of the dynamic tests with a delay-time theory. It is also shown that as the test temperature is lowered the slip by which the ferrite deforms in the static tests becomes finer. The dynamic apparatus employed in this investigation was such that eccentricity of loading was reduced to a minimum. A falling weight was used to apply compressive stress waves of the order of 10 5 lb. /in. 2 and duration 110 microseconds to the test specimens. Fire resistance strain gauges were used to obtain stress time records at points on a weighbar and on an anvil bar, just above and just below the specimen faces. From these records a method of wave analysis gives stress against time and particle velocity against time curves for both faces of the specimen. Using these derived curves dynamic stress-strain curves are found at various impact velocities and test temperatures. These stress-strain curves indicate the large increase in strength of the steel under such loading conditions – the dynamic stress-strain curves being from 100 to 200 higher than the room temperature static stress-strain curve. A further comparison of the above curves shows that for identical velocities of impact, as the test temperature is lowered the time to yield, and upper and lower yield stresses increase, whereas the permanent deformation, the ratio of dynamic upper yield stress to static upper yield stress at the same temperature, and the maximum and average strain rates all decrease. It is also found that in dynamic tests deformation occurs primarily by very fine slip. However, in some of the low temperature impacts twinning also occurs. Results indicate that the stress at which twins are initiated is approximately independent of temperature and strain rate. It is thought that for the medium carbon steel under test, this stress for twin formation is in the range 121, 000 lb. /in. 2 to 128, 000 lb. /in 2. The yield stress, delay-time results obtained in the dynamic tests are compared with Campbell's delay-time theory. This theory, which assumes that yield will occur when a critical number of source dislocations have been released from their atmospheres of carbon and nitrogen, is found to be in fair agreement with the experimental results. The greatest discrepancy between the theory and the results obtained occurs at the lower test temperatures. This is attributed mainly to twin formation. It is found that the effect of deforming the steel dynamically is to render it softer for subsequent static deformation of the same type. In particular the static upper yield stress is reduced to a minimum after about 1 permanent dynamic strain. Also it is found that the effect of 'pulsing' steel, i. e. subjecting it to a rapidly applied stress of insufficient magnitude and duration to cause yielding, is to reduce the upper yield stress obtained during static reloading. The effect of dynamic deformation at a low temperature on the subsequent static stress-strain curve is also considered. It is found that the static stress-strain curve obtained after an impact is little affected by lowering the test temperature, provided that the magnitude and duration of the impact stress are increased so as to obtain the same permanent strain. It is also shown that 'pulsing' the steel lowers the dynamic upper yield stress obtained in a subsequent impact test. It is found that the effect of a given stress pulse is greater on the subsequent dynamic upper yield stress than it is on the subsequent static upper yield stress. Also, whereas after a small amount of permanent dynamic strain an <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> is still evident in a static retest, in a dynamic retest the yield point has almost been eliminated. Finally, repeated impact tests appear to indicate that Campbell's criterion for yielding, i. e. that a critical number of dislocations must be released from their atmospheres, is approximately valid whether or not the dislocations are freed in one or several impacts, provided that no strain ageing occurs between tests. </p...|$|E
25|$|A yield {{strength}} or yield stress is the material property {{defined as the}} stress at which a material begins to deform plastically whereas <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> is the point where nonlinear (elastic + plastic) deformation begins.

40|$|This is {{a report}} of theoreticl and {{experimental}} researches on the mechanical charac-teristics of Osaka Diluvial Clay. Main results obtained here are as followsThe <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> value of Diluvial Clay can be measured as the stress corresponding tothe first inflection point of the stress-strain curve on a logarithmic scale obtained by thestress-controlled compression tests. Though the failure strength is effected by the rate ofstress-increment in stress-controlled compression tests, the <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> value is almost indi-fferent from the rate of stress-increment. The ratio of the <b>upper</b> <b>yield</b> value of Diluvialand Alluvial Clays is almost equal to 1. 7. Applying the concept deduced from the microscopic viewpoint, a new fundamentalformula concerning the secondary consolidation and the final value of consolidation isderived {{and the results of}} tests on secondary consolidation of Diluvial Clay are explainedmicroscopically by this formula. The values of rheological constants which influence therate of settlement of clay are computed and the magnitudes of secondary consolidation ofDiluvial and Alluvial Clays are compared quantitatively...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present a method that {{simplifies}} the standard procedure to determine the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> providing complementary information about changes in the behaviour of the materials under study. It is generally accepted that the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> is determined by the inflection point of the curve of pressure versus apparent volume of the sample, P(V), from Hg porosimetry runs. Although compressible materials present an easily identifiable neat inflection point, in resilient materials, the inflection point is not easy to identify by simple visual inspection of the curve. A physical magnitude (K') is introduced to characterise the evolution of the material's compliance under isotropic pressure. The physical meaning of K' is the variation in the resistance to uniform compression with the pressure applied, helping to identify the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> and the plastic mechanism beyond the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> in a single run. © 2009 Académie des sciences.
