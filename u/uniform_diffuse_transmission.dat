However, the acoustic mismatch model (diffuse mismatch model) is based on the hypothesis of a perfectly smooth (completely disordered) interface. Here, we present a new modified model, named as the mixed mismatch model, which considers the roughness/bonding at the interface. By taking partially specular and partially <b>diffuse</b> <b>transmissions</b> into account, the mixed mismatch model can predict the thermal interface conductance with arbitrary roughness. The proportions of specular and <b>diffuse</b> <b>transmission</b> are determined by the interface roughness which is described by the interfacial density of states.

40|$|<b>Diffuse</b> <b>transmission</b> and diffusing-wave {{spectroscopy}} (DWS) {{can be used}} {{to probe}} the structure and dynamics of opaque materials such as colloids, foams, and sand. A crucial step is to model photon transport as a diffusion process. This approach is acceptable for optically thick samples, far into the limit of strong multiple scattering; however, it becomes increasingly inaccurate for thinner samples for several reasons. Here, we correct for two of these defects. By modeling photon propagation by a telegrapher equation with suitable boundary conditions, we can account for the ballistic transport of photons at finite speed between successive scattering events. By introducing a discontinuity in the photon concentration at the source point, and then averaging over a range of penetration depths, we can account for the fact that photons usually scatter anisotropically into the forward direction, rather than being completely randomized at each event. The accuracy of our approach is tested by comparison both with random walk computer simulations and with experiments on specially designed suspensions of polystyrene spheres. We find that our predictions extend the utility of <b>diffuse</b> <b>transmission</b> to slabs of all thicknesses and of DWS to slabs down to about two transport mean free paths...|$|R

In the first experiment, a mixture of two monodisperse colloids with different particle diameters, but the same particle composition, is studied using diffusing-wave spectroscopy. We find that both the particle structure and the hydrodynamic interactions between large and small balls are well modeled by existing theories. These theories, however, do {{not comment on the}} observed diffusion of particles in complex solutions over distances larger than a particle diameter. Incidental observations during this experiment led to the second experiment, the study of the phase diagram of binary hard-sphere mixtures of colloidal particles. In the process of mapping this phase diagram, driven entirely by entropy, a novel surface phase was discovered. This surface phase is explained geometrically in terms of the entropy of the small particles in the suspension. In the final experiment, the diffuse model of photon transport is extended to create a new technique called <b>Diffuse</b> <b>Transmission</b> Spectroscopy (DTS) for exploiting the wave vector dependent structure of colloidal suspensions. DTS uses the wavelength dependent transmission of a slab of colloid to probe interparticle structure.

40|$|Quantitative {{ultrasound}} (QUS) {{techniques that}} parameterize the backscat-tered signal power spectrum have demonstrated significant promise for ultra-sonic tissue characterization. Some QUS parameters, including the effective scatterer diameter (ESD) and the effective acoustic concentration (EAC) {{that can be}} used for disease detection and diagnosis, require the assumption that the examined medium contains <b>uniform</b> <b>diffuse</b> scatterers. Structures that invalidate this assumption can significantly affect the estimated QUS parameters and decrease performance when classifying disease. In this study, methods were developed to reduce the effects of echoes that invalidate the assumption of <b>uniform</b> <b>diffuse</b> scattering. In order to accom-plish this task, backscattered signal sections containing non-diffuse echoes were identified and removed from the QUS analysis. In the first strategy, the data blocks used in the QUS estimation process and that contained non-diffuse echoes were identified and excluded from the QUS characterization of the diffuse scatterers. In the second strategy, power spectra were estimated using a method to reduce or eliminate the effects of non-diffuse echoes on the estimated data block power spectra. QUS analysis was then performed on the modified data block power spectra. Simulations and experiments were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed methods. Results indicate that the methods were able to significantly reduce or eliminate the effects of non-diffuse echoes that might exist in the backscattered signal. The methods provide a means to improve the diagnostics of QUS techniques by allowing separate analysis of diffuse and non-diffuse scatterers. ii To my family, for their love and support ii...|$|R

Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy {{is one of}} the most popular non-destructive detection methods. However, it is challenging to collect spectra exactly due to the multiple scattering and absorbing by the skin and internal tissues. In order to obtain the interactions between light and watermelon tissues, the transportation feature of NIR light in small, thin-skin watermelon was studied in the range of 750 – 900  nm. For this purpose, the <b>diffused</b> <b>transmission</b> spectra were collected with removing the sample slices along the perpendicular bisector of the source-detector line. Based on the spectra in effective wavelength band, the penetration depth curves were fitted by least square method, and the results of different detecting positions (equator and top) were compared. It was shown that, light penetration depth on the equator was 8. 3 – 9. 5  mm, 8. 7 – 17. 8  mm and 18. 9 – 38. 5  mm with source-detector distance of 10  mm, 20  mm and 30  mm, respectively. The penetration depth on the top was less than the equator. And the penetration depth increased with source-detector distance increasing. With deeper penetration depth, more information about internal quality was carried by the <b>diffused</b> <b>transmission</b> spectra. However, the intensity of spectra was weaker. According to these results, a reasonable source-detector distance could be designed for collecting effective information about internal quality.
