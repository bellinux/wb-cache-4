25|$|Starting {{off as a}} {{literary}} club in Adelaide, South Australia in 1938, the Jindyworobak movement was supported by many Australian artists, poets, and writers. Many were fascinated by Indigenous Australian culture and the Outback, and desired to improve the white Australian's <b>understanding</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> them. Other features came into play, among them white Australia's increasing alienation from its European origins; the Depression of the 1930s which recalled the economic troubles {{of the end of}} the 19th century; an increasingly urban or suburban Australian population alienated from the wild Australia of the Outback etc.; the First World War and the coming of World War II and also the coming of early mass market media in the form of the radio, recordings, newspapers and magazines.

500|$|Vivekananda {{was one of}} {{the main}} representatives of Neo-Vedanta, a modern {{interpretation}} of selected aspects of Hinduism in line with western esoteric traditions, especially Transcendentalism, New Thought and Theosophy. His reinterpretation was, and is, very successful, creating a new <b>understanding</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> Hinduism within and outside India, and was the principal reason for the enthusiastic reception of yoga, transcendental meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self-improvement in the West. Agehananda Bharati explained, [...] "...modern Hindus derive their knowledge of Hinduism from Vivekananda, directly or indirectly". Vivekananda espoused the idea that all sects within Hinduism (and all religions) are different paths to the same goal. However, this view has been criticised as an oversimplification of Hinduism.|$|E

He traveled throughout Lappland, Germany and Italy early in his career, and these cultures deeply informed his work. He painted and illustrated in a romantic nationalistic style, in part influenced by the Italian Renaissance and Sami cultures.

Examples in Dupont Circle include memorials honoring Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi of India, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk of Czechoslovakia, and Lajos Kossuth of Hungary. [...] The idea of a U.S. monument honoring Shevchenko began with the American Shevchenko Society, founded in 1898. [...] Although the group's efforts never came to fruition, Ukrainian Americans continued to pursue the goal. [...] A turning point was when Professor Ivan Dubrovsky wrote an article in Svoboda titled [...] "In Favor of a Shevchenko Monument in Washington, D.C.", asking for support from the Shevchenko Scientific Society and Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA). [...] Thousands of Ukrainian Americans sent letters to members of Congress while Lev Dobriansky, a Ukrainian American economist and anti-communism activist, became a prominent advocate and lobbyist for erecting a monument honoring Shevchenko. [...] The activists eventually gained the support of Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York and Representative Alvin Morell Bentley of Michigan. [...] Javits said [...] "Taras Shevchenko was a bard of freedom...It is fitting that the statue of such a national hero, who taught the American ideals of patriotism and service to man, should stand {{in the capital of}} the U.S." [...] and Bentley stated, [...] "In erecting a statue of Taras Shevchenko in Washington the United States will give full expression to its <b>understanding</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> Taras Shevchenko and all that he means to the brave and noble Ukrainian people." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{research}} {{explores the}} ways values, power, and politics shape and {{are shaped by}} digital infrastructure development through an in-depth study of HathiTrust’s “dark history,” the period of {{years leading up to}} its public launch. This research identifies and traces the emerging and iterative ways that values were surfaced and negotiated, decision making approaches were strategically modified, and relationships were strengthened, reconfigured, and sometimes abandoning through the process of generating a viable, robust and sustainable collaborative digital infrastructure. Through this history, we gain deeper <b>understandings</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciations</b> <b>of</b> the various <b>and</b> sometimes surprising ways that values, power, and politics are implicated in digital infrastructure development. Shedding light on this history enables us to better contextualize and understand the affordances, limitations, and challenges of the HathiTrust we know today, better envision its range of possible futures, <b>and</b> develop richer <b>appreciations</b> for digital infrastructure development more broadly...|$|R
50|$|To spread <b>and</b> {{share his}} <b>understandings</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> Chinese architecture, <b>and</b> most importantly, {{to help save}} its {{diminishing}} building technologies, Liang published his first book, Qing Structural Regulations in 1934. The book was {{on the study of}} the methods and rules of Qing architecture with the 1734 Qing Architecture Regulation and several other ancient manuals as the textbook, the carpenters as teachers, and the Forbidden City in Beijing as teaching material. Since its publication, for more than seven decades, this book has become a standard textbook for anyone who wants to understand the essence of ancient Chinese architecture. Liang considered the study of Qing Structural Regulation as a stepping stone to the much more daunting task of studying the Song dynasty Yingzao Fashi (Treatise on Architectural Methods), due to the large number of specialist terms used in that manual differing substantially from the Qing dynasty architectural terminology.|$|R
