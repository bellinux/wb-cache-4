40|$|Abstract. High {{intensity}} focused ultrasound (HIFU) is {{a promising}} noninvasive technique that thermally ablates tumors lying {{deep in the}} tissue, but the extent of thermal necrosis is difficult to quantify with current B-mode imaging techniques. Utilizing the fact that necrotic tissue is stiffer than normal tissue, we propose a new ultrasound elastographic imaging method to assess the progress of HIFU treatment. The method applies a mechanical compression to tissue being examined by pushing with a transducer, acquires its B-mode images freehand, and computes the phase difference between pre- and postcompression complex baseband echoes {{as an indicator of}} tissue stiffness. Being able to detect small displacements, the proposed method is implemented in real time in a commercial <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>scanner.</b> It is capable of producing strain images at a rate of up to 24 frames/s. The experimental results show that the method is a viable technique to monitor the change in stiffness of tissue under treatment with HIFU...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} thermal heat {{treatment}} on the mechanical and electrical properties of Cu–Ag alloys was investigated. The homogenization heat treatment {{leads to an}} increase in tensile strength and a decrease in electrical conductivity due to dissolution of Ag into copper matrix. Also, it is shown that electrical conductivity of as-cast Cu–Ag alloys decreases with increasing Ag content. In contrast, the aging heat treatment gives rise to increase both the tensile strength and electrical conductivity because the Ag solute diffuses out from copper matrix during aging heat treatment. Therefore, it can be mentioned that the electrical conductivity of Cu–Ag alloys depends on Ag solute in copper matrix. Also, aging treatment is favorable to acquire high strength and high electrical conductivity.
