Indeed, the inclusion of concurrency/parallelism allows the complete description of ATSs in TTCN, including the <b>upper</b> <b>tester</b> behavior. This paper introduces a new prototype technology that automates the production of MOT from an ATS completely specified in TTCN. This technology {{is based on an}} implementation of the operational semantics o...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, we will {{consider}} the distributed architecture for communication protocol conformance testing, where there are two remote testers, called the lower tester and the <b>upper</b> <b>tester.</b> During {{the application of a}} predetermined test sequence in the distributed architecture, the upper and the lower testers are bound to synchronize with each other only through their interaction with the implementation. However, this requirement may lead to a synchronization problem when the upper and the lower tester processes are forced to consider the timing of an interaction in which they have not taken part. We present a heuristic for generating a minimum length synchronizable test sequence for protocol conformance testing. The approach is based on a variation of a well-known problem in graph theory known as the Chinese postman problem. In this variation, for each edge e = (i,j) in a digraph D, we specify a subset of edges leaving j as the eligible successors for e, and require that each edge in the postman tour be followed by an eligible successsor. We present a heuristic to solve this variation of the Chinese postman problem, and develop a specialized version of this heuristic for the problem of generating a minimum length synchronizable test sequence. We show empirically that our specialized heuristic has superior performance compared to other known heuristics for this problem...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{report their}} {{experience}} in utilizing formal conformance testing techniques to test as an {{implementation of the}} CCITT Q. 931 protocol, for an ISDN business network being developed by a government telecom R&D concern in India. The Q. 931 standard is modelled as a FSM. A tool is implemented to generate conformance test sequences. This tool is based on graph theory and finite automata concepts, namely unique input output sequences, the rural Chinese postman algorithm, Euler tours, and optimization techniques such as linear programming and network-flow algorithms. In the tester design part, they use the single layer local test method, and give the detailed design of <b>upper</b> and lower <b>tester</b> and control process which is the test driver. They briefly report on the first cycle of testin...|$|R
