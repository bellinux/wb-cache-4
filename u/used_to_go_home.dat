I say seriously {{in the sense that}} like other kids go home and {{practice}} the violin or the piano or whatever, I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> from school every day, and I would write for about three hours. I was obsessed by it." [...] In 1935, he attended the Trinity School in New York City. He then attended St. Joseph Military Academy. In 1939, the Capote family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, and Truman attended Greenwich High School, where he wrote for both the school's literary journal, The Green Witch, and the school newspaper. When they returned to New York City in 1942, he attended the Franklin School, an Upper West Side private school now known as the Dwight School, and graduated in 1943. That was the end of his formal education.|$|E

It was after their {{appearance}} that the authorities were taught to be distrustful. You have little idea of the precautions taken nowadays. There is Sir William Harcourt, for instance, who is attended by policemen everywhere. I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> from the House behind him nightly, but I could never get him alone. I have walked in the very shadow of that man, but always in a company." ...|$|E

(He was a Norfolk boy, and <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> from Mrs. Nelson's [...] "Bell Inn," [...] Aldgate--but {{that is not to}} the point.) The next morning, of course, we were an hour before the time. I and another boy shared a hackney-coach; two-and-six: porter for putting luggage on coach, threepence. I had no more money of my own left. Rasherwell, my companion, went into the [...] "Bolt-in-Tun" [...] coffee-room, and had a good breakfast. I couldn't; because, though I had five-and-twenty shillings of my parents' money, I had none of my own, you see.|$|E

50|$|Perolz' arrest scandalized her family; several {{resolved}} {{to change their}} surname to 'Prole', to disassociate themselves from her. After questions in the British parliament and a court appearance, Perolz and Breda Foley were released in July 1916. They were issued with travel warrants and expected <b>to</b> <b>use</b> them <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> Ireland, landing at Dún Laoghaire. Immediately she was made Acting President of the Irish Women Workers' Union in Markievicz's stead. She travelled to England to greet her friend on her release from Aylesbury Prison on 17 June 1917, and accompanied her back to Ireland.|$|R
60|$|A {{long time}} afterwards, when these days were over, and Fate {{in its own}} way had {{disposed}} of the various persons now assembled in the dingy building in Lamb Court, perhaps some of them looked back and thought how happy the time was, and how pleasant had been their evening talks and little walks and simple recreations round the sofa of Pen the convalescent. The Major had a favourable opinion of September in London from that time forward, and declared at his clubs and in society that the dead season in town was often pleasant, doosid pleasant, begad. He <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> to his lodgings in Bury Street of a night, wondering that it was already so late, and that the evening had passed away so quickly. He made his appearance at the Temple pretty constantly in the afternoon, and tugged up the long black staircase with quite a benevolent activity and perseverance. And he made interest with the chef at Bays's (that renowned cook, the superintendence of whose work upon Gastronomy compelled the gifted author to stay in the metropolis), to prepare little jellies, delicate clear soups, aspics, and other trifles good for invalids, which Morgan the valet constantly brought down to the little Lamb Court colony. And the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to Pen by Doctor Goodenough, the Major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the Marquis of Steyne, passing through London {{on his way to the}} Continent, had ordered any quantity of his precious, his priceless Amontillado, that had been a present from King Ferdinand to the noble Marquis, to be placed at the disposal of Mr. Arthur Pendennis. The widow and Laura tasted it with respect (though they didn't in the least like the bitter flavour) but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it, and Warrington pronounced it superlatively good, and proposed the Major's health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served, and that of Lord Steyne and the aristocracy in general.|$|E

We often hanged out with jazzers, because we used to keep our instruments {{in the same room}} and we often used to stay together until three or four A.M. verse 'Dole ispod Slavije, kada šina savije' ('Down under Slavija, where the tram road turns') is a real experience from when we <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> from the Youth Center. Later, one of the jazzer said to me: 'You're not a jazzer, but you made one of the rare domestic jazz standards'." ...|$|E

50|$|On 10 August 1885 the Metropolitan Tramway and Investment Company began {{official}} horse-drawn tramway {{services for}} the public. The 18 tramcars were built from highly polished cedar and mahogany in the United States by J G Brill and Company and John Stephenson Company. Fares were expensive, with the typical patron belonging to the middle class. Some even <b>used</b> the services <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> for lunch. Depression struck in 1893 and combined with 1893 Brisbane floods the horse-drawn tramway services saw large drops in patronage.|$|R
5000|$|Dylan awakes in {{an unknown}} area. The blonde girl returns, leading {{him into a}} large base complex deep in the jungle. Inside, she plays a {{hologram}} of an army colonel who explains {{the truth of the}} disaster. In the future, it is discovered that the first overload in 2009 had consequently caused time alterations to the Cretaceous period that would lead to disastrous results. The space-time skew would alter the Earth's history dramatically and change the human race from ever existing. To fix this, an international organization enacted the [...] "Noah's Ark Plan": utilizing the Timegate technology, they would transport the living organisms of the Cretaceous to a different time with similar environments, where they could thrive unaffected by the alterations: three million years ahead. With the distortions prevented, the organisms would then be returned to their original time. However, there was an accident when the Noah's Ark team tried to return. The gate overloaded and was destroyed, stranding both the dinosaurs and humans far in the future. The helmeted attackers are revealed to be the only remaining children of the survivors, who were brought to the safety of a facility and placed in special life support chambers. These allowed for growth and learning, but were intended for use by the dinosaurs. The colonel explains that because of this, the children lost the ability to speak and were taught to co-exist with the dinosaurs, attacking anyone who threatened the animals. Finally, the hologram reveals himself to be Colonel Dylan Morton, speaking in 2055. Dylan realizes that he has been talking to a future version of himself, and that the blonde girl is his daughter, Paula. The hologram instructs Dylan there is a basic gate they can <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> but it will work only once. He pleads for Dylan to take Paula through the gate as well.|$|R

Lead singer Josh Heinrichs is quoted in an interview as saying [...] "Before MySpace... {{we were able to}} put our music up for free download online. We <b>used</b> <b>to</b> all <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and burn tons of copies of our albums off and give them away for free. We gave away thousands of CDs this way and it really made a huge difference in the attendance at our live shows and then when we were actually able to put out our first real album [...] Crucial. Our fans were totally willing to help us out and throw down $10. They had already heard the music and liked it." [...] The band also mailed CDs to fans in Europe, Asia and South America.|$|R
50|$|The player first takes {{control of}} Aurora after she awakens on an altar {{in the land}} of Lemuria. She meets and befriends a firefly named Igniculus, who leads her to a sword that she <b>uses</b> <b>to</b> arm herself, and {{eventually}} a chamber where the Lady of the Forest is imprisoned. Upon freeing the Lady, Aurora is told of the history of Lemuria. Lemuria was once ruled by the Queen of Light until one night when she mysteriously vanished. In the darkness, rose the Dark Queen Umbra who sent her daughters to steal Lemuria's light — the sun, the stars, and the moon. The Lady reveals to Aurora that the two worlds are connected by a mirror that was stolen by Umbra. To be able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the mirror <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> Aurora must recover Lemuria's light. The Lady then gives Aurora advice, a flute, and the stars which she had, granting Aurora the ability to fly.|$|R
500|$|In {{her last}} years, Bond entertained wounded World War I servicemen, {{playing the piano}} and singing at a south coast home for {{disabled}} soldiers and sailors. [...] An obituary in The Evening Standard reported: [...] "Every day {{for more than a}} year, until just recently, she was taken out in her wheelchair. [...] After a breath of sea air ... she would always go into her favourite hotel for a drink and would often sit down at the piano and entertain the company with some of her old Gilbert and Sullivan tunes. [...] She often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a <b>home</b> for wounded ex-servicemen of the last war [...] would give an impromptu entertainment, playing and singing her old songs. [...] She liked <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> parties and would always play and sing." [...] The Worthing Gazette stated that Bond continued to be much loved in her later years, and people came to see her from all over Britain to pay homage in her old age. The Worthing Herald wrote: [...] "Despite her great age, Miss Bond preserved a quick and active mind, and hated to be fussed over." ...|$|R
60|$|MY name is Arthur Gordon Pym. My {{father was}} a respectable trader in sea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born. My {{maternal}} grand{{father was a}}n attorney in good practice. He was fortunate in every thing, and had speculated very successfully in stocks of the Edgarton New Bank, as it was formerly called. By these and other means {{he had managed to}} lay by a tolerable sum of money. He was more attached to myself, I believe, than to any other person in the world, and I expected to inherit the most of his property at his death. He sent me, at six years of age, to the school of old Mr. Ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric manners--he is well known to almost every person who has visited New Bedford. I stayed at his school until I was sixteen, when I left him for Mr. E. Ronald's academy on the hill. Here I became intimate with the son of Mr. Barnard, a sea-captain, who generally sailed in the employ of Lloyd and Vredenburgh--Mr. Barnard is also very well known in New Bedford, and has many relations, I am certain, in Edgarton. His son was named Augustus, and he was nearly two years older than myself. He had been on a whaling voyage with his father in the John Donaldson, and was always talking to me of his adventures in the South Pacific Ocean. I <b>used</b> frequently <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> with him, and remain all day, and sometimes all night. We occupied the same bed, and he would be sure to keep me awake until almost light, telling me stories of the natives of the Island of Tinian, and other places he had visited in his travels. At last I could not help being interested in what he said, and by degrees I felt the greatest desire <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sea. I owned a sailboat called the Ariel, and worth about seventy-five dollars. She had a half-deck or cuddy, and was rigged sloop-fashion--I forget her tonnage, but she would hold ten persons without much crowding. In this boat we were in the habit of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world; and, when I now think of them, it appears to me a thousand wonders that I am alive to-day.|$|R
