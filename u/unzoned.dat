The average subsidy level per connection amounts to USD 169 for water supply and to USD 606 for sanitation. The average subsidy level per connection is 35 percent. Operators also developed awareness raising campaigns to make people aware of the option to connect to sewers through teams that go to market places. Under the output-based aid approach investments are pre-financed by the concessionaires or the public utility that are being reimbursed by GPOBA only after a verification process certifies that the households have been connected and receive an adequate service. According to the World Bank, the output-based aid approach has helped to improve processes, overcome financing obstacles and mobilize stakeholder partnership.|$|E

40|$|Shifting {{markets can}} cause unexpected, {{stochastic}} changes in rural landscapes {{that may take}} local communities by surprise. Preferential siting of new industrial facilities in poor areas or in areas with few regulatory restrictions can have implications for environmental sustainability, human health, and social justice. This study focuses on frac sand mining— the mining of high-quality silica sand used in hydraulic fracturing processes for gas and oil extraction. Frac sand mining gained prominence in the 2000 s in the upper midwestern United States where nonmetallic mining is regulated primarily by local zoning. I asked whether frac sand mines were more commonly sited in rural townships without formal zon-ing regulations or planning processes than in those that undertook zoning and planning before the frac sand boom. I also asked if mine prevalence was correlated with socioeco-nomic differences across townships. After creating a probability surface to map areas most suitable for frac sand mine occurrence, I developed neutral landscape models from which to compare actual mine distributions in zoned and <b>unzoned</b> areas at three different spatial extents. Mines were significantly clustered in <b>unzoned</b> jurisdictions at the statewide level and in 7 of the 8 counties with at least three frac sand mines and some <b>unzoned</b> land. Sub-sequent regression analyses showed mine prevalence to be uncorrelated with land value, tax rate, or per capita income, but correlated with remoteness and zoning. The predicted mine count in <b>unzoned</b> townships was over two times higher than that in zoned townships. However, the county with the most mines by far was under a county zoning ordinance, per-haps indicating industry preferences for locations with clear, homogenous rules over patch-work regulation. Rural communities can use the case of frac sand mining as motivation to discuss and plan for sudden land-use predicaments, rather than wait to grapple with unfa-miliar legal processes {{during a period of}} intense conflict...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The {{impact of}} Oregon's Special Use Assessment (SUA) program was {{analyzed}} {{in relation to}} farmland values in six regions. Data for the study {{were obtained from the}} Oregon Landownership Survey. Data were based on 1975 assessment and ownership characteristics. Farmland value per acre, including improvements, was believed to be influenced by the following factors: special use assessment, gross farm income, population growth rate, income of owner, occupation of owner, distance to the nearest urban area, size of tract, and improvements value. Ordinary least squares was used to test the impact of these factors on farmland value per acre. Tax savings, if any, resulting from SUA were expected to be capitalized into higher farmland values. Study results indicate that SUA did increase farmland values in four of the six regions. In the Coastal region, SUA on <b>unzoned</b> farmland increased values by 932 per acre. In the Valley region, SUA on exclusive farm use (EFU) zoned and <b>unzoned</b> farmland increased values by 977 and 1721 per acre, respectively. SUA increased <b>unzoned</b> farmland values by 1226 per acre in the Southwestern region but had no significant impact on zoned farmland. The value of zoned and <b>unzoned</b> farmland in the Northcentral region was increased by 453 and 865 per acre, respectively. SUA did not {{have a significant impact on}} zoned or <b>unzoned</b> farmland values in the Southcentral or Eastern regions. Therefore, it is assumed SUA does not provide tax relief in these regions. This result may be due to the large agricultural tax base in these regions. A large portion of the tax base is reduced by SUA, which necessitates an increase in the tax rate to maintain the same level of county revenues. Therefore, little if any tax relief is realized by the participating farmland owners. The restrictive effect of EFU zoning was expected to offset tax benefits resulting from SUA. As indicated above, there was a difference in the impact of SUA on EFU zoned as compared to <b>unzoned</b> land in the Valley, Southwestern,and Northcentral regions. The impact on zoned land was consistently smaller than on <b>unzoned</b> land in all regions (except the Southcentral where both were not significant). Most of the other variables in the model had the expected signs. Those that did not were not significantly different from zero (except for the distance variable in the Valley region which was explained after closer analysis). Tax savings and the resulting increases in farmland values represent a redistribution of income from nonparticipants to participants in the SUA program. In order to determine who was benefiting from SUA, participants were compared to nonparticipants on a number of ownership characteristics. Participants and nonparticipants did not differ on all characteristics in all regions. However, where there were differences, participants were more likely to be residents, farmers, own land further from urban areas, not have plans to sell their land, own larger acreages, and be in higher income and net worth classes compared to nonparticipants. The tax saving resulting from SUA may be sufficient to prevent a farmer from being forced out of farming. However, the program is not designed to prevent farmland conversion if the owner desires to change use. A circuit-breaker tax program for farmers and EFU zoning merit closer attention as possible alternatives of providing tax relief and farmland preservation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Microthermometric, {{petrographic}} and isotopic {{methods have}} been used to detect evidence for hot fluid flow in Mesozoic and Tertiary sediments from the NW UK continental margin, West of Shetland. New data presented here show that temperatures are hotter by c. 40 C in Tertiary samples than in the underlying Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments in wells 204 / 28 - 1, 206 / 5 - 2, 208 / 27 - 1, especially in cements from samples as young as mid–upper Eocene in age. Paleocene samples can be discriminated from older (Jurassic and Cretaceous) and younger (Eocene) sandstones on the basis of silica cement morphology and cathodoluminescence zonation. Jurassic, Cretaceous and Eocene quartz cements show oscillatory zoning as a consequence of relatively slow burial cementation. In direct contrast, rapid precipitation of silica cements from the cooling of hot fluids has produced <b>unzoned</b> cements in all but one Paleocene sample. No evidence for <b>unzoned</b> quartz cements was noted in any pre-Paleocene or Eocene samples. The restriction of hot fluid inclusions and <b>unzoned</b> cements to the Paleocene and post-Paleocene is consistent with lateral focusing of hot fluids. Isotopic data from kaolinites indicate that these fluids are best represented by mixtures of Mesozoic or Tertiary meteoric waters and marine porewaters that have undergone isotopic alteration through interaction with volcanic material. Our results indicate that hot fluid flow occurred over a relatively long time-scale (i. e. several million years), which may have important consequences for the degradation of reservoired hydrocarbons in West of Shetland Paleocene plays...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Oxygen isotope {{ratios and}} {{rare earth element}} (REE) {{concentrations}} provide independent tests of competing models of injection v. anatexis for the origin of migmatites from amphibolite and granulite facies metasedimentary rocks of the Adirondack Mountains, New York. Values of d 18 O and REE profiles were measured by ion microprobe in garnet–zircon pairs from 10 sample localities. Prior U–Pb SIMS dating of zircon grains indicates that inherited cores (1. 7 – 1. 2 Ga) are surrounded by overgrowths crystallized during the Grenville orogenic cycle (1. 2 – 1. 0 Ga). Cathodoluminescence imaging records three populations of zircon: (i) featureless rounded whole grains (interpreted as metamorphic or anatectic), and rhythmically zoned (igneous) cores truncated by rims that are either (ii) discordant rhythmically zoned (igneous) or (iii) <b>unzoned</b> (metamorphic or anatectic). These textural interpretations are supported by geochronology and oxygen isotope analysis. In both the amphibolite facies NW Adirondacks and the granulite facies SE Adirondacks, d 18 O(Zrc) values in overgrowths and whole zircon are highly variable for metamorphic zircon (6. 1 – 13. 4 &; n = 95, 10 lm spot). In contrast, garnet is typically <b>unzoned</b> and d 18 O(Grt) values are constant at each locality, differing only between leucosomes and corresponding melanosomes.

40|$|U–Th–Pb {{monazite}} dating by electron microprobe {{has been}} applied to three peraluminous granitic intrusions of the western Montes de Toledo batholith (MTB). Back scattered electron images of monazite crystals reveal a variety of internal textures: patchy zoning, overgrowths around older cores and <b>unzoned</b> crystals. On the basis of their zoning pattern and chemical composition, two monazite domains can be distinguished: (1) corroded cores and crystals with patchy zoning, exhibiting relatively constant Th/U ratios and broadly older ages, and (2) <b>unzoned</b> grains and monazite rims, with variable Th/U ratios and younger ages. The first monazite group represents inherited domains from metamorphic sources, which accounts for pre-magmatic monazite growth events. Two average ages from Torrico and Belvís de Monroy granites (33318 and 3335 Ma, respectively) relate these cores to a Viséan extensional deformation phase. The second group represents igneous monazites which have provided the following crystallization ages for the host granite: 29811 Ma (Villar del Pedroso), 3036 Ma (Torrico) and 3143 Ma (Belvís de Monroy). Two main magmatic pulses, the first about 314 Ma and the second {{at the end of the}} Carboniferous (303 – 298 Ma), might be envisaged in the western MTB.

40|$|SIMS data {{demonstrate}} Archean (2. 9 to 2. 7 Ga) and Paleoproterozoic (1991 ± 43 Ma) ages for rounded detrital zircon cores and <b>unzoned</b> rims respectively in a graulite sample {{collected from}} Huangtuling, Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt, China. The granulite rocks in this locality have pelitic compositions and represent an {{exposure of the}} northern margin of the Yangtze Craton. The rounded zircon cores show oscillatory zoning and have Th/U ratios (0. 17 - 0. 78) systematically {{higher than those of}} the <b>unzoned</b> luminescent rims (0. 005 - 0. 03). The age of the detrital zircon cores and whole rock Nd isotope model age suggest that the Huangtuling granulite was possibly derived from a provenance dominated by Archean rocks similar to the Kongling Complex exposed 200 km in the southwest. Multiple phases of metamorphism have been identified for the granulites, with the dominant granulite-facies mineral assemblage, defining an early clock-wise metamorphic P-T path. Orthopyroxene, plagioclase and whole-rock material define a linear trend in a 147 Sm/ 144 Nd - 143 Nd/ 144 Nd diagram, corresponding to an age of 1926 ± 146 Ma.
