50|$|Vertical mergers are mergers between {{firms that}} operate at {{different}} but complementary {{levels in the}} chain of production (e.g., manufacturing and an <b>upstream</b> <b>market</b> for an input) and/or distribution (e.g., manufacturing and a downstream market for re-sale to retailers) of the same final product. In purely vertical mergers there is no direct loss in competition as in horizontal mergers because the parties' products did not compete in the same relevant market. As such, there is no change in the level of concentration in either relevant market. Vertical mergers have significant potential to create efficiencies largely because the upstream and downstream products or services complement each other. Even so, vertical integration may sometimes give rise to competition concerns.|$|E

We show that, when {{a wave of}} mergers removes all upstream firms, the competitive forces on the <b>upstream</b> <b>market</b> may collapse. Indeed, when an integrated firm supplies the <b>upstream</b> <b>market,</b> it internalizes the fact that customers lost on the downstream market can be recovered via the <b>upstream</b> <b>market.</b> Thus, the upstream supplier charges higher downstream prices.

40|$|Purpose – Social {{marketing}} {{scholars have}} posited that influencing policy makers, regulators, managers and educators can help address societal problems “upstream”. Applying “upstream social marketing”, these groups {{can be treated}} as target audiences, and through use of marketing techniques, advocacy, stakeholder engagement, and informing evidence based policy making, their behaviour can be influenced to engender pro-social outcomes, for example through policy change. However, examples and guidance on how <b>upstream</b> social <b>marketing</b> can be effectively employed to successfully alter the structural environment is lacking. This article aims to unlock the potential of <b>upstream</b> social <b>marketing</b> by examining {{how it can be}} systematically employed. Design/methodology/approach – The article examines the development of the <b>upstream</b> social <b>marketing</b> concept in the extant literature, and presents some guiding principles, before analysing the case study of minimum unit pricing of alcohol in Scotland. The failure to comprehensively employ <b>upstream</b> social <b>marketing</b> in this case is compared with the successful use of <b>upstream</b> social <b>marketing</b> in tobacco control. Findings – The article suggests that heretofore, <b>upstream</b> social <b>marketing</b> has not always been systematically applied using social marketing principles. Guidance on <b>upstream</b> social <b>marketing</b> is presented, and thoughts on the trajectory of the concept for the future are offered. Originality/value – The paper identifies guidelines for unlocking the potential of <b>upstream</b> social <b>marketing,</b> and suggests areas in which future research and writings are required to help develop the concept...|$|R

These partial foreclosure outcomes {{are more likely to}} arise when final products are close substitutes, when the downstream firm is relatively inefficient, or when integrated firms offer two-part tariffs on the <b>upstream</b> <b>market.</b> We show that these equilibria degrade both social welfare and consumers ’ surplus, relative to the Bertrand outcome, and we derive conditions under which an input price cap can restore the competitiveness of the <b>upstream</b> <b>market.</b> Performing comparative statics on the market structure, we find that {{an increase in the number}} of integrated or downstream firms can actually increase the scope for partial foreclosure equilibria. We then wonder whether situations, in which the downstream firm does not receive the input at all, can emerge in equilibrium. We show that such complete foreclosure equilibria are more likely to arise when downstream products are close substitutes, the downstream firm is relatively inefficient...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{the existence}} of <b>upstream</b> <b>market</b> power affects endogenous quality choice in a setting where two downstream firms are locked in a bilateral monopoly with their own input suppliers. The main {{result is that the}} degree of product differentiation is reduced as <b>upstream</b> <b>market</b> power increases. This holds under Bertrand and Cournot competition, although differentiation is higher in the former. If competition takes place in a Cournot fashion and downstream firms have no bargaining power at all, they choose no differentiation. I also show the effects of an upstream and a downstream merger. When input suppliers merge to monopoly, the quality choice is not affected by the <b>upstream</b> <b>market</b> power and differentiation always emerges. When the downstream segment is shaped by a monopoly, goods become homogeneous unless input suppliers have weak bargaining power. If input prices are high enough before the downstream merger, a downstream monopoly leads to an increase in social welfare. vertical differentiation, endogenous quality choice, horizontal mergers...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} the European natural gas supply, GASMOD, which is structured as a two-stage-game of successive natural gas exports to Europe (<b>upstream</b> <b>market)</b> and wholesale trade within Europe (downstream market) and which explicitly includes infrastructure capacities. We compare three possible market scenarios: Cournot competition in both markets, perfect competition in both markets, and perfect competition in the downstream with Cournot competition in the <b>upstream</b> <b>market</b> (EU liberalization). We find that Cournot competition in both markets is the most accurate representation of today's European natural gas market, where suppliers at both stages generate a mark-up {{at the expense of the}} final customer (double marginalization). Our results yield a diversified supply portfolio with newly emerging (LNG) exporters gaining market shares. Enforcing competition in the European downstream market would lead to lower prices and higher quantities by avoiding the welfare-reducing effects of double marginalization. Binding infrastructure capacity restrictions strongly influence the results, and we identify bottlenecks mainly for intra-European trade relations whereas transport capacity in the <b>upstream</b> <b>market</b> is globally sufficient in the Cournot scenario. ...|$|E

In this paper we analyze {{the interaction of the}} natural gas network with the electricity network applying a partial equilibrium approach. The model is applied to a stylized representation of the European energy markets. We apply the model to two cases: first the impact of a supply reduction of natural gas on both markets by cutting imports from Russia, and second, the impact of the introduction of an emission restriction on electricity generation. Since natural gas can be an input for electricity generation, gas price level changes alter the generation dispatch. However, the network character of both markets leads to further effects that are not obvious on first sight. Congestion between markets and particular effects due to loop flows in electricity markets can lead to price and quantity effects in markets far away from the initial cause of market changes...|$|R

While most research dealing with this issue has adopted an empirical approach, we propose a theoretical approach. Farmers have a choice between two technologies, the conventional one using two complementary inputs, chemicals and seeds, and the organic one only requiring organic seeds. The <b>upstream</b> <b>markets</b> are oligopolistic and the firms adopt Cournot behavior. The game is solved backward. The equilibrium distribution of the farmers between both sectors is obtained by a free-entry condition. Since multiple equilibria could exist, including the non-emergence of organic farming, we spell out viability conditions for organic farming. Then, using an “infant industry” argument, we propose several public policy instruments able to support the development of organic farming and assess their relative efficiency. Results could be useful to assess the conditions of emergence and viability of agricultural innovations in analogous contexts...|$|R

We identify the perfect equilibrium for a symmetric model in each case and show that there is no simple relationship between the degree of connection between upstream and downstream firms and profitability. The key factor affecting prices and the relative profitability of the different market organizations is the degree of product differentiation among the downstream firms because it affects the intensity of competition among upstream suppliers.
