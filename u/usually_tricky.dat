50|$|Middlesbrough were up {{next for}} United, at the Riverside. A <b>usually</b> <b>tricky</b> {{game for the}} Reds ended with a {{comfortable}} 2-0 away win, thanks to goals either side of half-time. Ryan Giggs opened the scoring with his first goal since being named as PFA Player of the Year, and his 98th Premier League goal in total. Giggs received the ball from Nemanja Vidić, steadied himself, and slotted it past Brad Jones' left hand {{from the edge of}} the area with 25 minutes played. United created a handful of chances in the remainder of the first half but none worried Boro's Australian goalkeeper. Park Ji-sung doubled the Reds' lead though shortly after half-time. Giggs and Federico Macheda combined with a one-two before Wayne Rooney threaded a pass through the Boro defence to find Park superbly. Park then settled the game with a decisive strike low into the bottom corner.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} secure {{architecture}} of a CVS-server, its implementation (i. e. mainly its configuration) and its formal analysis. Our CVS-server is uses cvsauth, that provides protection of passwords {{and protection of}} some internal data of the CVS repository. In contrast to other (security oriented) CVS-architectures, our approach allows the CVS-server run on an open filesystem, i. e. a filesystem where users can have direct access both by CVS-commands and by standard UNIX/POSIX commands such as mv. For our secure architecture of the CVS-server, we provide a formal specification and security analysys. The latter {{is based on a}} refinement mapping high-level security requirements on the architecture on low-level security mechanisms on the UNIX/POSIX filesystem level. The purpose of the formal analysis of the secure CVS-server architecture is twofold: First, it is the bases for the specification of mutual security properties such as non-repudiation, authentication and access control for this architecture. Second, the mapping of the architecture on standard security implementation technology is described. Thus, our approach {{can be seen as a}} method to give a formal underpinning for the <b>usually</b> <b>tricky</b> business of system administrators...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Segmentation of {{handwritten}} {{input into}} individual characters {{is a crucial}} step in connected handwriting recognition systems. In this {{paper we propose a}} robust scheme to segment handwritten Bangla numbers (numerical strings) against the variability involved in the writing style of different individuals. The segmentation of digits from a number is <b>usually</b> very <b>tricky,</b> as the digits in a Bangla number are seldom vertically separable. We have introduced the concept of Degenerated Lower Chain (DLC) for this purpose. The DLC method was proved efficient in case of segmenting handwriting digits in our experiments. Ten pages of handwritten Bangla numerical strings containing 2000 individual digits that construct 700 numbers written by five different writers of variable ages were segmented by the developed system. The system achieves more than 90 % segmentation accuracy on average...|$|R
40|$|Statistical, photometric, and kinematical {{arguments}} {{suggest that}} encounters, accretion, and merging of galaxies are likely the key mechanisms {{for the formation}} of present-day ellipticals. While major merger events leave strong and clearly measurable signatures, those left by minor (or "soft") ones are <b>usually</b> rather <b>tricky</b> to observe. The authors present a new image-filtering technique capable to detect weak photometric signatures (down to 5 % of the local value of the surface brightness) of structures which may be interpreted as signatures of past accretion phenomena. By applying this technique to a sample of 28 early-type galaxies observed with the ESO-NTT telescope, the authors have revealed faint structures such as nuclear disks, ripples, bars, distorted disks, warps, etc., in more than 90 % of the galaxies. The revealed structures are also capable to explain some anomalies in the photometric properties which were known to exist by means of more traditional techniques...|$|R
