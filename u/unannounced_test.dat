40|$|We {{recently}} reported that nuclear grading in prostate cancer {{is subject to}} a strong confirmation bias induced by the tumor architecture. We now wondered whether a similar bias governs nuclear grading in breast carcinoma. An <b>unannounced</b> <b>test</b> was performed at a pathology conference. Pathologists were asked to grade nuclei in a PowerPoint presentation. Circular high power fields of 27 invasive ductal carcinomas were shown, superimposed over low power background images of either tubule-rich or tubule-poor carcinomas. We found (a) that diagnostic reproducibility of nuclear grades was poor to moderate (weighed kappa values between 0. 07 and 0. 54, 27 cases, 44 graders), but (b) that nuclear grades were not affected by the tumor architecture. We speculate that the categorized grading in breast cancer, separating tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic figure counts in a combined three tier score, prevents the bias that architecture exerts on nuclear grades in less well-controlled situations...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} use of {{role-playing}} games (RPGs) as a methodological approach for teaching cellular biology, assessing student satisfaction, learning outcomes, and retention of acquired knowledge. First-year undergraduate medical students at two Brazilian public universities attended either an RPG-based class (RPG group) or a lecture (lecture-based group) on topics related to cellular biology. Pre- and post-RPG-based class questionnaires were compared to scores in regular exams and in an <b>unannounced</b> <b>test</b> one year later to assess students' attitudes and learning. From the 230 students that attended the RPG classes, 78. 4 % responded that the RPG-based classes were an effective tool for learning; 55. 4 % thought that such classes were better than lectures but did not replace them; and 81 % responded that they would use this method. The lecture-based group achieved a higher grade in 1 of 14 regular exam questions. In the medium-term evaluation (one year later), the RPG group scored higher in 2 of 12 questions. RPG classes are thus quantitatively as effective as formal lectures, are well accepted by students, and may serve as educational tools, giving students the chance to learn actively and potentially retain the acquired knowledge more efficiently...|$|E

40|$|English phraseology abounds with alliterative {{multiword}} units (e. g., slippery slope), {{which suggests}} that alliterative word strings have a comparative advantage to become stock phrases. One plausible explanation for this advantage is that alliterative word strings are relatively memorable, all else being equal, although there is little directly pertinent empirical evidence. In the context of instructed second language acquisition, {{it has been suggested}} that alliteration has a good potential to facilitate the learning of multiword units (MWU), at least when learners are made aware of the presence of alliteration in these units. In the present article, we investigate whether alliteration also makes MWUs comparatively memorable also in the absence of awareness-raising. English alliterative phrases and matched controls were dictated to EFL learners whose ability to recall the phrases was subsequently gauged in <b>unannounced</b> <b>tests.</b> We found a modest, short-lived mnemonic effect of alliteration. This points to an important role for awareness-raising if teachers or materials writers wish to help learners capitalise on the mnemonic advantage afforded by alliteration...|$|R

As Wada’s ambition is not only to have clean competitions, but also clean athletes, different measures need to be implemented to facilitate testing in-between competitions as well. One of them is making sportspersons fill a form to inform doping controllers about their whereabouts, so that they can reach the athletes and make them undergo <b>unannounced</b> <b>tests.</b> Wada’s anti-doping policy has been widely criticized for violating athletes’ right to privacy.

A preliminary conclusion reached is that the right of privacy is not a single right, but rather a cluster of rights, each one designed to protect different areas of our lives, and each one derived in its turn from other, more fundamental rights. A further conclusion to be advanced in this article is that Wada’s whereabouts policy cannot be condoned by any of the moral philosophical approaches traditionally discussed in connection with privacy...|$|R

40|$|At a large scale, {{the human}} brain is {{organized}} into modules of interconnected regions, some of which play opposing roles in supporting cognition. In particular, the Default-Mode Network (DMN) {{has been linked to}} operations on internal representations, while task-positive networks are recruited during interactions with the external world. Here, we test the hypothesis that the generation of durable long-term memories depends on optimal recruitment of such antagonistic large-scale networks. As long-term memory consolidation is a process ongoing for days and weeks after an experience, we propose that individuals characterized by strong decoupling of the DMN and task-positive networks at rest operate in a mode beneficial for the long-term stabilization of episodic memories. To capture network connectivity unaffected by transient task demands and representative of brain behavior outside an experimental setting, 87 participants were scanned during rest before performing an associative encoding task. To link individual resting-state functional connectivity patterns to time-dependent memory consolidation processes, participants were given an <b>unannounced</b> memory <b>test,</b> either after a brief interval or after a retention period of ~ 6 weeks. We found that participants with a resting state characterized by high synchronicity in a DMN-centered network system and low synchronicity between task-positive networks showed superior recollection weeks after encoding.
