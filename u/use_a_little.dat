Jon Caramanica of Rolling Stone gave the album 3 stars stating, [...] "When she really gets her hands dirty, Kim sounds more forceful and engaged than she's been in years". However, some critics felt {{the album was}} too long and contained too many fillers. Birchmeier of AllMusic stated the album could <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> [...] "trimming". Brett Berliner of Stylus Magazine said, [...] "I enjoy about eight songs on this album, but they're tracks I only feel like listening to from time to time".|$|E
500|$|George Lucas {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film (originally titled Munchkins) in 1972. Similar in intent to Star Wars, he created [...] "a number of well-known mythological situations for a young audience". During the production of Return of the Jedi in 1982, Lucas approached Warwick Davis, who was portraying Wicket the Ewok, about playing Willow Ufgood. Five years passed before he was actually cast in the role. Lucas [...] "thought {{it would be great to}} <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> person in a lead role. A lot of my movies are about a little guy against the system, and this was just a more literal interpretation of that idea." ...|$|E

[...] They lauded its freshness {{in spite of}} its police procedural genre, saying that it was [...] "bursting with new ideas" [...] and [...] "ejuvenated a whole new genre". [...] Airlock Alpha also commended 17th Precinct for incorporating a fresh take on the police procedural genre, though also felt the pilot introduced too many characters and concepts. [...] TG Daily thought the concept was cool, though they felt [...] "the execution could <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> polish". [...] They also specifically lauded Bamber, Helfer, and Callis, while not being overly impressed by the supporting cast. [...] In the end, they would have preferred 17th Precinct over Grimm.|$|E
500|$|Describing her character's personality, Smith has stated: [...] "Dr. Hahn is a {{workaholic}} and she's very professional [...] I think {{she feels that}} there should be professionalism at work, and when other people do things that aren't professional she gets a little upset.", adding: [...] "She has little rules in her head about how you’re supposed to act at work. That doesn’t mean she can’t break the rules. But everyone else is supposed to follow them." [...] Stacy McKee, writer of season four episode [...] "Kung Fu Fighting", which saw the establishment of Hahn as a main character, has deemed her: [...] "hardcore. [...] a kick ass female surgeon". Smith has explained that the show's writers [...] "didn’t want to rush to make [...] likable, and hoped I didn’t mind. A lot of actors don’t want to be unlikable, even if they’re the bad guy. But I’m okay with that— I’m good with being unlikable." [...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes, discussing the rivalry between Hahn and her Resident Cristina Yang – which saw Hahn reprimanded by Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), Seattle Grace's Chief of Surgery, for her lack of encouragement— has given the insight: [...] "Hahn is a brilliant surgeon and is great with her patients but her teaching skills? [...] Well, let's just say she can <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more loving care with her students, particularly Cristina. [...] I felt sorry for Hahn because Hahn grew up in a surgical world that included even fewer women than there is now (so Hahn is accustomed to a [...] "dog eat dog" [...] kind of surgical world)." [...] Trish Doolan, who consulted with the show's producers on the developing lesbian storyline between Hahn and Callie Torres, said of the character: [...] "She's very strong, very good at what she does, and actually a lot of men are threatened by that. She's very confident with what she does and who she is".|$|E
500|$|Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly {{awarded the}} album a [...] "B-" [...] grade, opining that, [...] "the peaks on Neighborhoods — their first disc {{in eight years}} — {{do little more than}} recall past triumphs. Outside of some latent goth leanings ('This Is Home') and a gauzy detour ('Ghost on the Dance Floor'), it's mostly twitch-crunch-whine-repeat." [...] Michael Brown of Drowned in Sound gave a mixed review, {{awarding}} the album a lukewarm five out of ten. He critiqued that, [...] "Blink have the potential for much more than their past reputation may convey, but Neighborhoods is reminiscent of that first awkward conversation after a heated argument, as no-one's quite sure where to go next." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone gave the album three stars out of five, noting elements of sophistication, introspection, and darkness in the music and lyrics and commenting that [...] "Some Clinton-era pants-dropping might've been a fun nostalgia move. But those days are gone; it's their early-2010s nightmare as much as anyone else's." [...] Kyle Ryan of The A.V. Club was critical of DeLonge's vocals, saying that he [...] "sounds flat as ever, and has a fondness for clunky lyrics", concluding that [...] "Although Blink-182 has long since left its past as a bare-bones punk band behind, overwrought rock isn't its forte, either. Neighborhoods finds a nice balance between the two, but it could still <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less fussiness." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine considered it uninspired: [...] "When they try to add relatively ambitious elements to the things they actually do well, Blink-182 is more successful. [...] It's admirable that Blink-182 tries to challenge themselves over the course of Neighborhoods, but their growing pains don't make for a particularly good album or a welcome comeback." [...] Scott McLennan of The Boston Globe considered the album a step forward, summarizing, [...] "Blink-182 again delivers a record with nothing outright awful and enough dynamite songs to pack a punch at future tours." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin called the album [...] "surprisingly and refreshingly low-key," [...] but its self-examination [...] "comparatively adrift" [...] with the sound of their past.|$|E

2500|$|Paul advises Timothy that {{he should}} not drink water only, but should <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> wine {{for the sake of his}} stomach and {{frequent}} infirmities. Some have suggested this advice is particularly in reference to purifying low quality drinking water, while others suggest it was simply intended to help his digestion and general sickliness. Abstentionists generally regard this passage as a positive example of abstention from wine and see Paul's instructions as exceptional and purely for the sake of health, while other interpreters suggest that Timothy was [...] "upright in his aims" [...] but here guilty of an [...] "excess of severity" [...] or that he felt inappropriately bound by a Hellenistic custom that younger men should not drink.|$|E
2500|$|On April 28, 1932, Bow {{signed a}} two-picture deal with Fox Film Corporation, for Call Her Savage (1932) and Hoop-La (1933). Both were successful; Variety favored the latter. The October 1934, Family Circle Film Guide rated {{the film as}} [...] "pretty good entertainment", and of Miss Bow said: [...] "This is the most {{acceptable}} bit of talkie acting Miss Bow has done." [...] However, they noted, [...] "Miss Bow is presented in her dancing duds as often as possible, and her dancing duds wouldn't weigh two pounds soaking wet." [...] Bow commented on her revealing costume in Hoop-La: [...] "Rex accused me of enjoying showing myself off. Then I got a little sore.

2500|$|In 1984, Vainio {{started his}} season by {{finishing}} third at the Rotterdam Marathon {{with a personal}} record of 2:13:04. After the race he gave a doping sample in the test organized by the Finnish Athletics Association. The test did not have official status and was merely {{considered to be a}} control test to help avoid Finnish athletes getting caught at the tests performed in international championships. Therefore, only the so-called A-sample was taken and not the B-sample, which is used to ensure the test result after a positive A-sample. However, Vainio's A-sample was tested positive for anabolic steroids, and the head coach of the Finnish Athletics Federation, Antti Lanamäki, delegated Timo Vuorimaa, the head coach of long-distance runners, to inform Vainio about the test result. Vuorimaa informed Vainio only by mentioning that there was something strange in his test sample, not providing detailed information about the substance. Vainio believed that he had only been using [...] testosterone and not anabolic steroids at all. Therefore, his only action was to give up drug <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit earlier prior to the anticipated tests.|$|E
2500|$|Spamhaus {{alleged that}} CyberBunker, in {{cooperation}} with [...] "criminal gangs" [...] from Eastern Europe and Russia, was behind the attack; CyberBunker {{did not respond to}} the BBC's request for comment on the allegation, however Sven Olaf Kamphuis, the owner of CyberBunker, posted to his Facebook account on 23 March [...] "Yo anons, we could <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> help in shutting down illegal slander and blackmail censorship project 'spamhaus.org,' which thinks it can dictate its views on what should and should not be on the Internet." [...] According to The New York Times Kamphuis also claimed to be the spokesman of the attackers, and said in a message [...] "We are aware {{that this is one of}} the largest DDoS attacks the world had publicly seen", and that CyberBunker was retaliating against Spamhaus for [...] "abusing their influence".

2500|$|The film review {{aggregator}} Rotten Tomatoes reports 71% positive reviews {{based on}} 52 surveyed critics {{and an average}} score of 7.4/10. [...] The site's consensus reads: [...] "The ending could <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> work but this is otherwise another sterling example of David Fincher's iron grip on atmosphere and storytelling." [...] Metacritic rated it 61/100 based on 19 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, praising Douglas as [...] "the right actor for the role. He can play smart, he can play cold, and he can play angry. He is also subtle enough that he never arrives at an emotional plateau before the film does, and never overplays the process of his inner change". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Mr. Fincher, like Michael Douglas in the film's leading role, does show real finesse in playing to the paranoia of these times". Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "Fincher's style is so handsomely oppressive, and Douglas' befuddlement is so cagey, {{that for a while}} the film recalls smarter excursions into heroic paranoia (The Parallax View, Total Recall)". In his review for The Washington Post, Desson Howe wrote, [...] "It’s formulaic, yet edgy. It’s predictable, yet full of surprises. How far you get through this tall tale of a thriller before you give up and howl is a matter of personal taste. But there’s much pleasure in Fincher’s intricate color schemes, his rich sense of decor, his ability to sustain suspense {{over long periods of time}} and his sense of humor". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "Emotionally, there's not much at stake in The Game — can Nicholas Van Orton be saved?! — but Douglas is the perfect actor to occupy the center of a crazed Rube Goldberg thriller. The movie has the wit to be playful about its own manipulations, even as it exploits them for maximum pulp impact". In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle wrote, [...] "At times The Game is frustrating to watch, but that's just a measure of how well Fincher succeeds in putting us in his hero's shoes". However, Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers felt that [...] "Fincher's effort to cover up the plot holes is all the more noticeable for being strained ... The Game has a sunny, redemptive side that ill suits Fincher and ill serves audiences that share his former affinity for loose ends hauntingly left untied".|$|E
