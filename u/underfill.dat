30|$|The {{configuration}} of the earliest Karoo foreland system accounts for a forebulge elevated above the base level during Dwyka times, representing the early <b>underfilled</b> stage followed by a time of system-wide sedimentation during Ecca times (late <b>underfilled</b> stage), when the forebulge subsided below the base level {{under the influence of}} dynamic subsidence. During the entire <b>underfilled</b> stage, the foredeep hosted a relatively deep marine environment with glacio-marine (Dwyka) followed by pelagic and gravity flow (lower-middle Ecca) sediments. The upper part of the Ecca Group reflects a filled stage of shallow marine sedimentation followed by the overfilled style of fluvial sedimentation of the overlying Beaufort and Stormberg groups (Catuneanu et al. 2005).

30|$|Equally as {{important}} as osmotic stimuli, effective arterial blood volume is a potent regulator of AVP release. In fact, arterial <b>underfilling</b> even prevails over osmotic stimuli, in case of competing and antagonist effects on AVP secretion. Whenever arterial blood <b>underfilling</b> is encountered, in such opposite circumstances as “true hypovolemia” or so called “effective hypovolemia” a clinical picture commonly found in decompensated cirrhosis and congestive heart failure, AVP release is elicited, even if PNa is decreased. In these clinical settings, patients with “effective hypovolemia” typically exhibit both neurohormonal patterns of arterial <b>underfilling</b> and an increased extracellular fluid volume status (ECFV) with interstitial edema and expanded total plasma and blood volume, in contrast with patients with “true hypovolemia”. The corresponding clinical picture is one of non- maximally diluted urine and an excessive water load will inevitably give rise to hyponatremia.|$|R
30|$|Handling {{of sodium}} {{excretion}} by the kidney is complex, involves {{a great number}} of humoral and neurohumoral mediators dedicated at defending the effective arterial blood volume. More specifically, in patients who display “effective hypovolemia”, either caused by systemic arterial vasodilation or a decrease in cardiac output, arterial <b>underfilling</b> represents the unifying determinant which triggers this cascade of neurohormonal responses. Alongside the secretion of AVP, the plasma renin-angiotensinogen-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated. Renal arterial vasoconstriction ensues causing a fall in the glomerular filtration rate. This phenomenon, combined with the direct effect of enhanced angiotensin II activity, promotes proximal tubular sodium reabsorption. In addition, arterial <b>underfilling</b> also unleashes the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) which acts as yet another major player. Not only is the SNS connected with non-osmotic vasopressin stimulation, but is also closely intertwined with the RAAS. The SNS interacts with the latter by stimulating the release of renin. Activation of the SNS also results in marked renal vasoconstriction through α-adrenoreceptor stimulation, further increasing renal arterial resistance while decreasing glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow [44]. This complex interplay between AVP, the SNS and the RAAS in the setting of arterial <b>underfilling</b> drives the emergence of an edematous state. Furthermore, it serves as physiopathological basis which reconciles the coexistence of increased ECFV and arterial <b>underfilling</b> or “effective hypovolemia” [45 – 47].|$|R
50|$|Flip chips {{have several}} disadvantages. The {{lack of a}} carrier means they are not {{suitable}} for easy replacement, or manual installation.

Also, the short connections are very stiff, so the thermal expansion of the chip must be matched to the supporting board or the connections can crack.

5000|$|To {{attach the}} flip chip into a circuit, the chip is {{inverted}} {{to bring the}} solder dots down onto connectors on the underlying electronics or circuit board. The solder is then re-melted to produce an electrical connection, typically using a Thermosonic bonding or alternatively reflow solder process. This also leaves a small space between the chip's circuitry and the underlying mounting. In most cases an electrically-insulating adhesive is then [...] "underfilled" [...] to provide a stronger mechanical connection, provide a heat bridge, and to ensure the solder joints are not stressed due to differential heating of the chip {{and the rest of}} the system.The <b>underfill</b> distributes the thermal expansion mismatch between the chip and the board, preventing stress concentration in the solder joints which would lead to premature failure.|$|E
40|$|Encapsulants and <b>underfills</b> are {{polymeric}} materials containing some levels of low molecular mass chemicals which turn into volatiles during heat exposures.

It would be of interest to know what and when the volatiles undergo thermal desorption and are released during high temperature exposures such as during solder reflow or during environmental testing, Moisture turning to steam is not the only vapor present during solder reflow. With the push towards lead-free and higher reflow temperatures, this outgassing behavior is of particular significance to assist in the improvement of manufacturing yields. Using evolved gas analysis with gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer, vapors found from epoxy mold compounds are carbon dioxide, moisture, methyl alcohol, benzene, isobutyl methyl ketone, triphenyl phosphine and occasionally, siloxanes from stress releasing agents. Gases reflecting curing byproducts or unreacted products are observed. For <b>underfills,</b> these gases are either absent of much reduced.

OBJECTIVES The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of under- and overfilling citrate test tubes on ROTEM(®) EXTEM measurements. RESULTS Overall repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated significant differences of CT (p = 0. 004), CFT (p = 0. 005), A 5 (p = 0. 001), A 10 (p < 0. 001), and MCF (p < 0. 001). Pairwise comparison revealed that <b>underfilling</b> significantly altered the results of those parameters reflecting functional clot firmness (A 5, A 10, and MCF), while overfilling led to a prolongation of the CT results only. No differences were observed for alpha angle and maximum lysis. CONCLUSION Both <b>underfilling</b> and overfilling specimen tubes have significant influence on the results of the ROTEM(®) EXTEM test, although the small observed bias is likely of limited clinical relevance.

In this study, JEDEC level 3 moisture sensitivity preconditioning followed by thermal cycling (TCB,- 55 oC~ 125 oC) was conducted. Two reflowable <b>underfill</b> mainly differentiated by curing kinetics and adhesion strength, namely <b>Underfill</b> A and <b>Underfill</b> C, were evaluated. Failure analysis was carried out via C-SAM and cross section. Unit failure that was electrically identified in present study was defined as occurrence of bridging and/or open circuit. The results showed that for packages assembled with <b>Underfill</b> A that has superior adhesion with silicon nitride passivation, all units can pass preconditioning but bridging commenced to appear at 750 cycles. Open circuitry was encountered between 1750 and 2000 cycles. While for <b>Underfill</b> C with fast cure characteristics and relatively weaker adhesion compared to <b>Underfill</b> A, bridging and open circuitry started to surface at 500 and 1250 cycles, respectively. Failure analysis indicated that bridging mainly resulted from solder bump extrusion through micro voids trapped between adjacent bumps during assembly process; meanwhile the gap between neighboring bumps {{is too close to}} prevent convergence of two extruded bumps. Open circuitry is originated by several factors such as insufficient wetting, <b>underfill</b> delamination, die crack, <b>underfill</b> crack etc. On the whole, no <b>underfill</b> delamination and die crack have been observed before 1000 cycles in present study.

40|$|The {{flip chip}} {{packaging}} {{has become one}} of the most popular electronics packaging technologies for all kinds of applications. For high end applications like central processing units (CPU), the flip chip packaging technology demonstrates its distinctive advantage of high efficiency to dissipate heat from the silicon chip. Flip chip packages have also received tremendous interests for low end applications such as watch modules and smart card due to their light weight and thin package profiles for low cost applications. Fiber reinforced organic substrates are commonly employed to lower the material costs. This raises concerns on mechanical and thermal mismatches between the silicon chip and the organic substrate. The consequence is that there are significant stress concentrations in the solder joints due to the difference in dimensional changes between the silicon chip and the organic substrate during thermal cycles. To reduce the relative displacements and to redistribute the stress over the entire package, an <b>underfill</b> resin is encapsulated along the gap between the chip and the substrate as a stress buffer. The introduction of an <b>underfill</b> in the package also raises other reliability issues, for example, weak interfacial adhesion between package components, process-induced residual stress as during assembly, proper selection of component materials etc. The objective of the present thesis is to gain some new insights into the above underfill-related reliability issues in flip chip packages. To measure the interfacial adhesion between the <b>underfill</b> and other package components, the button shear tests were performed and the corresponding failure behaviors were characterized. The correlations between the elements obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the thermodynamic characteristics determined from the contact angle measurement were established. The UV/Ozone treatment on the polymeric soldermask surface offered the possibility of further enhancement of the adhesion with the <b>underfill</b> material. The interfacial adhesion between the <b>underfill</b> and other components were also characterized. The interfacial adhesion of <b>underfill</b> with eutectic solder was far weaker than the other interfaces, indicating the necessity to treat the solder surface to improve the bond. Incomplete filling of the <b>underfill,</b> either due to flux residue, entrapped gas altered the mode of solder joint failure from hydrostatic fatigue cracking to plastic deformation. An optimized UV/Ozone treatment on polymeric soldermask surface enhanced the interfacial bond strength with <b>underfill</b> resin. The bi-material strip bending (BMSB) method has been successfully developed to in-situ monitor the evolution of the residual stresses in epoxy-based <b>underfill</b> resins during curing and thermal cycles. The residual stress in the silica filled conventional <b>underfill</b> was higher than that of the rubber modified no-flow <b>underfill.</b> The importance of the properties of <b>underfill,</b> such as modulus and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), in governing its residual stress after cure were discussed. Isothermal contraction of epoxy is also noticed during thermal cycles at temperature below the glass transition temperature. The numerical model based on the time-temperature dependent <b>underfill</b> material is compared with that based on the linear elastic <b>underfill</b> material. The importance of material properties of package components, such as the moduli and CTEs of the <b>underfill,</b> solder and PCB, in reducing the stress concentrations is highlighted. The effect of process-induced defects in the <b>underfill</b> layers is also studied. Thermo-elastic modeling of <b>underfill</b> behavior underestimate the stress and strain levels in the solder joints, due to the underestimate of the relaxation of polymeric <b>underfill.</b> The rigidity of PCB substrate also influenced significantly the lifetime of solder interconnection.
