5|$|As {{with other}} dwarf sphaeros, {{little is known}} about the ecology and {{behaviour}} of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero. Because of its high surface-area-to-volume ratio that results from its diminutive size, the species was thought to be susceptible to water loss, so it has been studied to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> survives in its semi-arid habitat. Unlike desert-dwelling lizards, the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lacks special adaptations to prevent desiccation and loses water at a rate similar to that of lizards from mesic habitats. From size differences alone, it loses water 70% faster than the larger and sympatric big-scaled least gecko. It survives instead by inhabiting humid microhabitats in its dry environment, by adjusting its reproductive cycle so that hatchlings emerge during the time of year with the highest precipitation, and by reducing activity during the driest parts of the day.|$|E

The United States believed that cholera was brought by recent immigrants, specifically the Irish, and epidemiologists understand they were carrying disease from British ports. Lastly, some British thought the disease might rise from divine intervention.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to frame the US FID effort {{within the context of}} the US doctrine it supports and to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> fits into the HN Internal Defense and Development (IDAD) program. US military support to FID should focus on assisting an HN in anticipating, precluding, and countering threats or potential threats and addressing the root causes of instability. Emphasis on internal developmental programs as well as internal defense programs when organizing, planning, and executing military support to US FID activities is essential. Although the FID operation is considered military engagement, security cooperation, and deterrence, FID may include or support operations from across the range of military operations to support the HN's IDAD strategy. Accordingly, US military operations supporting FID provide training, materiel, advice, or assistance to local forces executing an IDAD program, rather than US forces conducting IDAD military missions for the HN. Internal threats means threats manifested within the internationally recognized boundaries of a nation. These threats can come from, but are not limited to, subversion, insurgency (including support to insurgency), and/or criminal activities.|$|E

Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "At the time it sounded like a foreign language, whereas now we <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> works". The arrangement, with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes, was rehearsed many times, but the group struggled to get a performance they liked. According to co-producer Daniel Lanois, [...] "that was the science project song. I remember having this massive schoolhouse blackboard, as we call them. I was holding a pointer, like a college professor, walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking nerd. It was ridiculous." [...] Co-producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name". The band worked on a single take for weeks, but as Eno explained, that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up. Through all of their work, they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance.|$|E

500|$|Chapter XI {{deals with}} {{evidence}} from biogeography, {{starting with the}} observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions cannot be explained by environmental differences alone; South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals. The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration {{played an important role}} in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: [...] "On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case." [...] Darwin explained how a volcanic island formed a few hundred miles from a continent might be colonised by a few species from that continent. These species would become modified over time, but would still be related to species found on the continent, and Darwin observed that this was a common pattern. Darwin discussed ways that species could be dispersed across oceans to colonise islands, many of which he had investigated experimentally.|$|E
500|$|Villeneuve {{was joined}} by Jody Scheckter in 1979 after Carlos Reutemann moved to Lotus. Villeneuve won three races during the year and even briefly led the {{championship}} after winning back to back races in USA and South Africa. However, the season is mostly remembered for Villeneuve's wheel-banging duel with René Arnoux in the last laps of the 1979 French Grand Prix. Arnoux passed Villeneuve for second place with three laps to go, but Villeneuve re-passed him on the next lap. On the final lap Arnoux attempted to pass Villeneuve again, and the pair ran side-by-side through the first few corners of the lap, making contact several times. Arnoux took the position but Villeneuve attempted an outside pass one corner later. The cars bumped hard, Villeneuve slid wide but then passed Arnoux on the inside at a hairpin turn and held him off for {{the last half of}} the lap to secure second place. Villeneuve commented afterwards, [...] "I tell you, that was really fun! I thought for sure we were going to get on our heads, you know, because when you start interlocking wheels it's very easy for one car to climb over another." [...] At the Dutch Grand Prix a slow puncture collapsed Villeneuve's left rear tyre and put him off the track. He returned to the circuit and limped back to the pits on three wheels, losing the damaged wheel on the way. On his return to the pits Villeneuve insisted that the team replace the missing wheel, and had to be persuaded that the car was beyond repair. Villeneuve might have won the World Championship by ignoring team orders to beat Scheckter at the Italian Grand Prix, but chose to finish behind him, ending his own championship challenge. The pair finished first and second in the championship, with Scheckter beating Villeneuve by just four points. During the extremely wet Friday practice session for the season-ending United States Grand Prix, Villeneuve set a time variously reported to be either 9 or 11 seconds faster than any other driver. His teammate Jody Scheckter, who was second fastest, recalled that [...] "I scared myself rigid that day. I thought I had to be quickest.

2500|$|The Muqaddimah {{anticipated}} the meteorological climate theory of environmental determinism, later proposed by Montesquieu in the 18th century.

[...] He explained the differences between different peoples, whether nomadic or sedentary peoples, including their customs and institutions, {{in terms of their}} [...] "physical environment-habitat, climate, soil, food, and the different ways in which they are forced to satisfy their needs and obtain a living." [...] This was a departure from the climatic theories expressed by authors from Hippocrates to Jean Bodin. It has been suggested that Ibn Khaldun may have had an influence upon Montesquieu's theory through the traveller Jean Chardin, who travelled to Persia and described a theory resembling Ibn Khaldun's climatic theory.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{her career}} critics noted Cotton's {{popularity}} {{with the public}} and her success in gaining prestigious commissions. They found much to like in many of her portraits but some complained of unevenness in her output and even sloppy handling. In 1917 a reviewer said, [...] "Mrs. Cotton is a disappointing painter in that her work varies so greatly, some of it unusually good, {{and some of it}} so weak as to make it difficult to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> could proceed from the same brush." [...] In 1926 another reviewer attributed at least some of this variability to a necessary compromise. As a professional portraitist she was obliged to please her subjects. This meant {{that at least some of}} the time she had to balance her desire to create good art with the sitter's desire to be presented in a certain way.

2500|$|The extensiveness of {{regolith}} on Gaspra and {{its presence}} overall {{is a matter}} of debate, and not fully understood. Visually, the somewhat subdued and mantled appearance suggests a substantial regolith. Also, correlations are seen between the subtle color variations and local topography, and {{it has been suggested that}} this is caused by the slow migration of regolith to lower areas. It is, however, difficult to explain the origin of a putative regolith. Firstly, Gaspra's escape velocity is very small, so small that it is difficult to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> could keep a significant portion of fragments ejected by impacts from escaping. This may be alleviated if Gaspra is a porous body or started with a large regolith, but one has to explain how the original regolith appeared. A possible resolution of the issue may be that Gaspra obtained a regolith during the Flora-family forming impact that also created Gaspra itself. [...] Secondly, it has been estimated that the matter ejected by all the craters would be only enough to cover Gaspra with 10 m of regolith. However, some craters are much deeper than this without showing any structural difference on their walls.|$|E
