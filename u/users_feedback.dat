30|$|In general, storing {{arbitrary}} <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> could require {{very large}} storage {{space and the}} computational cost of typical clustering algorithms (such as k-means) is high. However, the anchor merge mechanism proposed in our <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> model merges all similar user anchors which avoids the need to store every user anchor. Furthermore, the grid-based clustering in the <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> model only needs to cluster each user anchor within the same grid-cell, which significantly reduces the calculation time. As a result, even {{with the addition of}} the <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> mechanisms to the positioning system, the resulting approach remains efficient.|$|R

40|$|<b>User</b> <b>feedback</b> {{is mainly}} {{defined as an}} {{information}} source for evaluating the customers’ satisfaction for a given goods, service or software application. Due to the wide diffusion of the Internet and to the proliferation of mobile devices, users access a myriad of software services and applications, {{at any time and}} in any place. In this context <b>users</b> can provide <b>feedback</b> upon their experience in using software, through dedicated software applications or web forms. This online <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> is a powerful source of information for improving the software service or application. Specifically in software engineering, <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> is recognized as a source of requests for change in a system, so it can contribute to the evolution of software systems. Indeed, <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> is gaining more attention from the requirements engineering research community, and dedicated buzzwords have been introduced to refer to research studies in RE, i. e. mass RE and crowd RE. Arguing on this premise, the possibility of exploiting <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> is worth to be investigated in requirements engineering, by addressing open challenges in collection {{as well as in the}} analysis of online feedback. The research work described in this Thesis starts with a stateof-the-art literature analysis that revealed that the definition of <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> as an artifact, as well as the characterization and understanding of its process of elaboration and communication were still unexplored, especially from the requirements engineering perspective. We adopted a multidisciplinary approach by borrowing concepts and techniques from ontologies, philosophy of language, natural language processing, requirements engineering and human computer interaction.

30|$|In a real environment, <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> can {{be either}} helpful or malicious. At this point, {{we assume that the}} {{accuracy}} of <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> follows the normal distribution. Thus, the <b>feedback</b> from malicious <b>users</b> should exist as outliers. We could employ some supervised classification algorithms such as logistic regression or SVM to classify the malicious users. However, the Wi-Fi RSS fingerprinting based positioning is essentially an unsupervised or instances-based approach (similar to KNN). For instance-based learning, we can cluster different <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> based on their RSS features and locations, which avoids labeling whether the user is benign or malicious. As described in the previous section, we take the grid-based clustering approach with predefined centres. The reliability of each cluster is compensated by our <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> model. Furthermore, the performance of instance-based approaches is in fact highly dependent on whether we will have a large dataset or the noise level in training dataset. Thus, if the noise level is very high (e.g., all <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> are from malicious users), the performance of the system will not be acceptable.|$|R

The history of both positive feedback and negative feedback will affect the compensation ability of such a mask. In general, positive <b>feedback</b> generates <b>user</b> anchors and enhances their reliability. On the other hand, negative feedback reduces the trustworthiness of an anchor. All <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> will be assigned low compensation power when first created and can be enhanced with multiple similar feedback events. As such, this <b>user</b> <b>feedback</b> model {{should be able to}} gradually update the system’s knowledge and guide the system to learn the changes in the Wi-Fi indoor environments. Based on these principles, we have built a prototype and conducted experiments to evaluate it.
