5000|$|On June 19, 2013, {{while giving}} {{a speech at the}} National Press Club, President and CEO of the Associated Press Gary Pruitt said: “Some {{longtime}} trusted sources have become nervous and anxious about talking with us — even on stories unrelated to national security. In some cases, government employees we once checked in with regularly will no longer speak to <b>us</b> <b>by</b> <b>phone.</b> Others are reluctant to meet in person... And I can tell you, that this chilling effect on newsgathering is not just limited to AP. Journalists from other news organizations have personally told me, that it has intimidated both official and nonofficial sources from speaking to them as well.” ...|$|E

40|$|We {{are delighted}} {{to present a}} great range of {{exciting}} titles for Spring 2016 in our new catalogue. In April we will be publishing Colin Marsden’s new history of the scenic railways around in and around Dawlish, with some spectacular photographs of the line collapse in 2014 and its subsequent rebuilding. An intriguing new history of the doomed APT project comes in June, and May will see {{the publication of a}} significant new treatment of Gresley’s magnificent six Class P 2 locomotives, whetting the appetite for the appearance of the brand new P 2 s currently under construction. For modellers, May brings a wonderful book by Paul Bambrick- Creating a Backscene which will inspire all scenic modellers that the creation of their own painted landscape backscene is well within their reach, even if they are not artists. Railway atlases continue to be popular with all our readers, so the new year brings Atlas of the Southern Railway, a detailed mapping of the entire Southern Railway network during its period of operation. Lovers of gradient profiles will be delighted to see a re-origination of the British Railways main line gradient profiles as they existed on the eve of nationalisation, now provided with a detailed index to aid reference. There should be something for everyone in our new 2016 list, and we always welcome ideas for new books and even the reappearance of fondly remembered older titles! So keep contacting <b>us</b> <b>by</b> mail, <b>phone,</b> email or via our social media channels...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the fifth}} edition of Tracking Onslow and the first {{that is not the}} result of a visit to the town. In June 2014 we were told that the Shire would not be funding the flights, {{accommodation}} or printing for the edition and so the ECU crew looked for other ways to continue documenting the impact of Wheatstone and Macedon on Onslow. Fortunately, our previous visits in July 2012, February 2013, July 2013 and February 2014 had filled our contact books with names and numbers and clued us in to issues that needed to be followed up. After a phone around for updates it was clear {{that this is not the}} time to be letting go of the process of documenting the challenges facing the Onslow community. We are very grateful to teacher James Trimble and his students, Amber and Taylor, for helping with the In Your Words section. We’d also like to thank everyone who spoke to <b>us</b> <b>by</b> <b>phone</b> and sent us images. We heard that there were concerns expressed earlier in the year about an image of the Anzac Memorial on our last cover and we would like to clarify that we did nothing to encourage the children to climb on it. We saw them there and snapped the picture. The photo is a true representation of something that happens in Onslow, and as such we reported it. One of the key functions of journalism is operating as a ‘town square’, where the opinions of different members of the community are aired. In this way a publication can help facilitate debate and understanding between different groups. We know that not everyone in Onslow agrees with each other, but we seek to allow everyone a space to speak through our pages. Sometimes opinions are based on misunderstood facts and so some of the things people say may not be true. We can’t vouch for the truth of what the people we spoke to said, but we have faithfully recorded it so that this edition is a true record of what was being said in and about Onslow in mid-late 2014. We hope you enjoy reading it...|$|E
