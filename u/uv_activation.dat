Gas sensing {{properties of the}} as-grown nanostructures were investigated under thermal and <b>UV</b> <b>activation.</b> The performance of the ZnO nanodisk gas sensor {{was found to be}} superior to that of other nanostructures (Sg ∼ 3700 % to 300 ppm ethanol and response time and recovery time of 8 and 13 s). The enhancement in sensitivity is attributed to the surface polarities of the different structures on the nanoscale. Furthermore, the selectivity of the gas sensors can be achieved by controlling the UV intensity used to activate these sensors.

To date, the scientific basis for the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of most manufactured nanomaterials are not understood. The mechanisms underlying the toxicity of nanomaterials have recently been studied intensively. An important mechanism of nanotoxicity is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overproduction of ROS can induce oxidative stress, resulting in cells failing to maintain normal physiological redox-regulated functions. This in turn leads to DNA damage, unregulated cell signaling, change in cell motility, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and cancer initiation. There are critical determinants that can affect the generation of ROS. These critical determinants, discussed briefly here, include: size, shape, particle surface, surface positive charges, surface-containing groups, particle dissolution, metal ion release from nanometals and nanometal oxides, <b>UV</b> light <b>activation,</b> aggregation, mode of interaction with cells, inflammation, and pH of the medium...|$|R
40|$|Background: Topical flavonoids, such as quercetin, {{have been}} shown to reduce {{ultraviolet}} (UV) irradiation-mediated skin damage. However, the mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in this protective effect are not clear. UV irradiation leads to activation of two major signaling pathways, namely nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and activator protein- 1 (AP- 1) pathways. Activation of NF-kappa B pathway by UV irradiation stimulates inflammatory cytokine expression, whereas activation of AP- 1 pathway by UV irradiation promotes matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production. Both pathways contribute to UV irradiation-induced skin damage, such as photoaging and skin tumor formation. Objective: To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we examined the effect of quercetin on <b>UV</b> irradiation induced <b>activation</b> of NF-kappa B and AP- 1 pathways. Methods: Primary human keratinocytes, the major skin cell type subjected to physiological solar UV irradiation, were used to study the effects of quercetin on UV irradiation-induced signal transduction pathways. Results: Quercetin decreased UV irradiation-induced NF-kappa B DNA-binding by 80 %. Consequently, quercetin suppressed UV irradiation-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 beta (similar to 60 %), IL- 6 (similar to 80 %), IL- 8 (similar to 76 %) and TNF-alpha (similar to 69 %). In contrast, quercetin had no effect on <b>UV</b> irradiation <b>activation</b> of three MAP kinases, ERK, JNK, or p 38. Accordingly, induction of AP- 1 target genes such as MMP- 1 and MMP- 3 by UV irradiation was not suppressed by quercetin. Conclusion: Our data indicate that the ability of quercetin to block UV irradiation-induced skin inflammation is mediated, at least in part, by its inhibitory effect on NF-kappa B activation and inflammatory cytokine production.

40|$|Small organic molecules, {{including}} small molecule based fluorescent probes, small molecule based {{drugs or}} prodrugs, and smart multifunctional fluorescent drug delivery systems play {{important roles in}} biological research, drug discovery, and clinical practices. Despite the significant progress made in these fields, the development of novel and diverse small molecules is needed to meet various demands for research and clinical applications. My Ph. D study focuses {{on the development of}} novel functional molecules for recognition, imaging and drug release. In the first part, a turn-on fluorescent probe is developed for the detection of intracellular adenosine- 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) levels based on multiplexing recognitions. Considering the unique and complicated structure of ATP molecules, a fluorescent probe has been implemented with improved sensitivity and selectivity due to two synergistic binding recognitions by incorporating of 2, 2 ’-dipicolylamine (Dpa) -Zn(II) for targeting of phospho anions and phenylboronic acid group for cis-diol moiety. The novel probe is able to detect intracellular ATP levels in SH-SY 5 Y cells. Meanwhile, the advantages of multiplexing recognition design concept have been demonstrated using two control molecules. In the second part, a prodrug system is developed to deliver multiple drugs within one small molecule entity. The prodrug is designed by using 1 -(2 -nitrophenyl) ethyl (NPE) as phototrigger, and biphenol biquaternary ammonium as the prodrug. With controlled photo activation, both DNA cross-linking agents mechlorethamine and o-quinone methide are delivered and released at the preferred site, leading to efficient DNA cross-links formation and cell death. The prodrug shows negligible cytotoxicity towards normal skin cells (Hekn cells) with and without <b>UV</b> <b>activation,</b> but displays potent activity towards cancer cells (HeLa cells) upon <b>UV</b> <b>activation.</b> The multiple drug release system may hold a great potential for practical application. In the last part, a new photo-initiated fluorescent anticancer prodrug for DNA alkylating agent mechlorethamine releasing and monitoring has been developed. The theranostic prodrug consists a photolabile NPE group, an inactive form of mechlorethamine and a nonfluorescent coumarin in one small molecule. It is demonstrated that the prodrug shows negligible cytotoxicity towards normal skin cells (Hekn cells) with and without <b>UV</b> <b>activation,</b> while the original parent drug mechlorethamine can be photocontrol-released and induces effective DNA cross-linking activity. Importantly, the drug release progress can be conveniently monitored by the ‘off-on’ fluorescence enhancement in cells. Moreover, the selective prodrug is not only cell permeable but also nuclear permeable. Therefore, the prodrug serves as a promising drug delivery system for spatiotemporal control release and monitoring of an anticancer drug to obtain the optimal treatment efficacy.

To create the photoreactive DNA probe in situ, DNA substrates containing a synthetic abasic site are incubated in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cellular extract {{in the presence}} of base-substituted arylazido derivatives of dNTPs. This results in synthesis of a photoreactive long patch base excision repair (BER) intermediate. The arylazido photoreactive group is then activated through energy transfer from the pyrene group of a dNTP analog (Pyr-dUTP), following 365 nm UV light exposure. Pyr-dUTP binds to the active site of DNA polymerases, and the pyrene group, when excited by 365 nm UV light, activates the nearby photoreactive group in the BER intermediate resulting in crosslinking of DNA-bound DNA polymerases.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the photoprotective effect of niacin in ultraviolet (UV) -irradiated human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT cells). We found that niacin effectively suppressed the UV-induced cell death and cell apoptosis of HaCaT cells. Existing data have shown that AKT activation is involved in the cell survival process.

This imbalance of collagen homeostasis impairs the structure and function of the dermal collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM), thereby promoting premature skin aging (photoaging). We report here that aberrant dermal collagen homeostasis in UV-irradiated human skin is mediated {{in part by a}} CCN-family member, cysteine-rich protein- 61 (CYR 61 /CCN 1). CYR 61 is significantly elevated in acutely UV-irradiated human skin in vivo, and UV-irradiated human skin fibroblasts. Knockdown of CYR 61 significantly attenuates UV irradiation-induced inhibition of type-I procollagen and upregulation of MMP- 1. Determination of CYR 61 mRNA and protein indicates that the primary mechanism of CYR 61 induction by UV irradiation is transcriptional. Analysis of CYR 61 proximal promoter showed that a sequence conforming to the consensus binding site for transcription factor activator protein- 1 (AP- 1) is required for promoter activity. UV irradiation increased the binding of AP- 1 -family members c-Jun and c-Fos to this AP- 1 site.

SEM and FTIR-ATR data showed clear evidence of fungal development: growth and ramifications of hyphae on the polymer surface with the increase in UV pre-treatment time and fungus incubation time. The results indicated that the simple <b>UV</b> surface <b>activation</b> process {{has proven to be a}} promising alternative for polyether PU waste management...|$|R
40|$|Ru/TiO 2 and Ru/Al 2 O 3 {{catalyst}} {{have been}} synthesized using impregnation method followed by calcinations at temperature of 550 0 C. The synthesized catalysts {{were characterized by}} XRD, SEM and EDS. Based on characterization result, the active phase of Ru in form of RuO 2 was well coated and dispersed on the support surface. The catalysts were then used in photocatalytic oxidation of phenol {{in the presence of}} peroxymonosulphte (PMS) as an oxidant and UV-light from Mercury lamp which is categorized as UV-C, with wave length in range of 200 - 280 nm. Both catalyst are effective for application of photocatalytic oxidation of phenol in the present PMS and <b>UV.</b> Further, <b>activation</b> of PMS for the production of sulphate radicals for phenol degradation in this study is generated by the interaction PMSCatalyst and PMS-UV. The photocatalytic catalyst of Ru/TiO 2 and Ru/Al 2 O 3 can increase the removal efficiency of 10 - 15 %. The activity in phenol removal of Ru/TiO 2 -PMS-UV is slightly higher than Ru/Al 2 O 3 -PMS-UV. Both catalysts also showed good performance {{in the second and third}} runs after regeneration for multiple uses. Kinetic studies showed that phenol oxidation on the catalysts, Ru/TiO 2 and Ru/Al 2 O 3 in the present of PMS and UV follows the first order reaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{free radical}} {{polymerization}} of acrylonitrile (AN) initiated by Cu(I 1) 4 -anilino 3 -pentene 2 -one [Cu(II) ANIPO] Cu(II), 4 -p-toluedeno 3 -pentene 2 -one [Cu(II) TPO], and Cu(I 1) 4 -p-nitroanilino 3 -pentene 2 -one [Cu(II) NAPO] was studied in benzene at 50 and 60 °C and in carbon tetrachloride (CCld), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and methanol (MeOH) at 60 °C. Although the polymerization proceeded in a heterogeneous phase, it followed the kinetics of a homogeneous process. The monomer exponents were 22 at two different temperatures {{and in different}} solvents. The square-root dependence of R, on initiator concentration and higher monomer exponents accounted for a 1 : 2 complex formation between the chelate and monomer. The complex formatign was shown by ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> study. The <b>activation</b> energies, kinetics, and chain transfer constants were also evaluated...|$|R
