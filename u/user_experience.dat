To make the device stand out among its competition, the HTC One was developed with a major emphasis on unique hardware and software features; which included a unibody aluminum frame, a 1080p full-HD display, dual front-facing stereo speakers, a camera with a custom image sensor and the ability to automatically generate montages of media, an updated version of HTC’s Sense <b>user</b> <b>experience,</b> BlinkFeed—an aggregator of news and social network content, and an electronic program guide app with the ability to serve as a universal remote via an IR blaster located in the device’s power button.|$|E

40|$|Observations of Information Retrieval (IR) system <b>user</b> <b>experiences</b> {{reveal a}} strong desire for {{collaborative}} search {{while at the same}} time suggesting that collaborative capabilities are rarely, and then only in a limited fashion, supported by current searching and visualization tools. Equally interesting is the fact that observations of <b>user</b> <b>experiences</b> with Group Support Systems (GSS) reveal that although access to external information and the ability to search for relevant material is often vital to the progress of GSS sessions, integrated support for collaborative searching and visualization of results is lacking in GSS systems. After reviewing both <b>user</b> <b>experiences</b> described in IR and GSS literature and observing and interviewing users of existing IR and GSS commercial and prototype systems, the authors conclude that there is an obvious demand for systems supporting multi-user IR [...] It is surprising to the authors that very little attention has been given to the common ground shared by these two important research domains. With this in mind, our paper describes how <b>user</b> <b>experiences</b> with IR and GSS systems has shed light on a promising new area of collaborative research and led to the development of a prototype that merges the two paradigms into a Collaborative Information Retrieval Environment (CIRE). Finally the paper presents theory developed from initial <b>user</b> <b>experiences</b> with our prototype and describes plans to test the efficacy of this new paradigm empirically through controlled experimentation...|$|R
