On June 23, Yeah! was released, followed by the release of Hell Yeah on August 18. Guitarists White and Hodgson were unavailable, so Konietzko recruited Chris Harms from Lord of the Lost to record the guitar parts. Harms, along with Lord of the Lost bandmates Pi (guitar) and Gared Dirge (keyboards), had been slated to perform as the live band for KMFDM's late 2017 tour. Lord of the Lost were unable to secure work visas to enter the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>so</b> Andee Blacksugar was tapped to handle guitar tasks instead.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, C.F. Theodor Steinweg (H.E. Steinweg's son) {{changed his}} name to C.F. Theodore Steinway, and served as the leader and chief {{technician}} of Steinway & Sons for fifteen years. He did not like living in the <b>US,</b> <b>so</b> he kept his home in Braunschweig and traveled back and forth as needed. In 1880 he stopped traveling overseas and started a new Steinway & Sons piano factory in Hamburg, competing with his father's old firm, now called Grotrian-Steinweg, in making pianos for European customers. After establishing the business, Steinway retired to Braunschweig for his last years. He died in 1889, leaving his collection of pianos to the city's museum. The Hamburg factory proved successful in competing against Grotrian-Steinweg—both companies were known for producing premium pianos.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of Villa's attack on Columbus, New Mexico in 1916, Villa's {{military}} power had been marginalized (he was repulsed at Columbus by a small cavalry detachment, albeit after {{doing a lot of}} damage), his theater of operations was mainly limited to western Chihuahua, he was persona non grata with Mexico's ruling Carranza constitutionalists, and the subject of an embargo by the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>so</b> communication or further shipments of arms between the Germans and Villa would have been difficult.|$|E

25|$|If supply equals demand, they {{cease to}} act, {{and for this}} very reason {{commodities}} are sold at their market-values.

25|$|Its {{primary goal}} {{continues}} to be to transform education, by enabling children in low-income countries {{to have access to}} content, media and computer-programming environments. At the time that the program launched, the typical retail price for a laptop was considerably in excess of $1,000 (<b>US),</b> <b>so</b> it was infeasible to achieve this objective without also bringing a low-cost machine to production. This became the OLPC XO Laptop, a low-cost and low-power laptop computer. The project was originally funded by member organizations such as AMD, eBay, Google, Marvell Technology Group, News Corporation, Nortel. Chi Mei Corporation, Red Hat, and Quanta provided in-kind support.|$|E

25|$|ABC, CBS and NBC are {{headquartered}} in New York City, {{which is the}} largest television market in the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>so</b> their respective radio and television stations in that market are considered the overall network flagship stations. As programming schedules increased and modern technology improved transmission to affiliates, the networks set up operations centers in New York City (for the East Coast feed) and Los Angeles (for the West Coast feed). Los Angeles is the second largest television market in the U.S., and traditional home to the motion picture industry and its pool of popular talent, {{one of the reasons the}} radio networks set up operations there in the 1930s and 1940s (just as the medium of television was starting to take off).|$|E

25|$|In many markets from Japan and South Korea, to Europe, to Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, most {{children}} age 8-9 have mobile phones {{and the new}} accounts are now opened for customers aged 6 and 7. Where mostly parents tend to give hand-me-down used phones to their youngest children, in Japan already new cameraphones are on the market whose target age group is under 10 years of age, introduced by KDDI in February 2007. The USA also lags on this measure, as in the <b>US</b> <b>so</b> far, {{about half of all}} children have mobile phones. In many young adults' households it has supplanted the land-line phone. Mobile phone usage is banned in some countries, such as North Korea and restricted in some other countries such as Burma.|$|E
25|$|Also in October 2008 U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines {{announced}} that, {{as part of}} a major {{expansion of}} its route network in Africa, it would begin a once-weekly service between Atlanta and Monrovia, via Sal, Cape Verde. The proposed service would have commenced in June 2009, utilizing a Boeing 757-200 configured for ETOPS operations in a two-class configuration. The news marked the return of an American carrier and direct flights to the United States {{for the first time since}} Pan Am's withdrawal, and would make RIA one of only a handful of African airports with service to the <b>US,</b> <b>so</b> was therefore seen as a major step in the recovery of not just the airport, but Liberia itself. The route was revised in May to originate from New York's JFK and connect via Dakar, beginning on 9 June, Monday, and returning every Tuesday.|$|E
25|$|In Sentell v.

The company claimed that Louisiana law held that only people who licensed their dogs were entitled to sue for compensation if the dog were killed, and that Mr. Sentell was not entitled to damages since he had not licensed his dog. The trial court in Orleans Parish found for Mr. Sentell and awarded him $250 <b>US,</b> <b>so</b> the railroad company appealed to the Louisiana Court of Appeal, which reversed the decision of the trial court. The Louisiana Supreme Court declined to hear the case, so Mr. Sentell then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which agreed to hear the case.|$|E
