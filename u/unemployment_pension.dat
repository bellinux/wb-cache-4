50|$|Those {{eligible}} for unemployment benefits receive them in two ways. A basic daily allowance of about 25 € goes to any person looking for employment. This allowance was meanstested, and {{the income of}} a spouse could disqualify a potential beneficiary. The allowance lasts {{as long as the}} recipient was unemployed. Those unemployed who are members of an unemployment fund (about 80 percent of Finns are) and who have worked for at least 26 weeks in the preceding 2 years are {{eligible for}} more substantial benefits amounting to the daily basic allowance plus 45 percent of the difference between their daily wage and the basic allowance. After 100 days the payment is reduced by 20 percent. Beneficiaries of the income-related allowance could receive it for 500 days in a 4-year period. Workers in their late fifties and older who had been unable to find work can be granted an <b>unemployment</b> <b>pension</b> equal to a disability pension until they reached the age when they would be eligible for an old-age pension. Unemployment benefits are administered by the Social Security Institute. The basic allowance is completely financed by the state. Employers and the state fund equal shares of 95 percent of the income-related payments and the beneficiary is responsible for the remaining 5 percent.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of a Finnish reform in the 1990 s that {{restricted}} the use of particular early retirement channels, <b>unemployment</b> <b>pension</b> and individual early retirement, and simultaneously changed the rules of firm size related experience rating in disability pensions. Our emphasis is on how the reforms affected the incentives of the firms to hire older employees. In a simple model we illustrate how forward-looking behaviour of firms affects the value of a new hire. Simulations with the model illustrate that although the reform in the <b>unemployment</b> <b>pension</b> in principle affected particular age groups, 53 - 54 year olds in the case of <b>unemployment</b> <b>pension</b> and 55 - 57 year olds in the case of individual early retirement, the impacts on hiring may have been felt also in other, younger, age groups. On the other hand, the effects of both reforms are likely to have varied by firm size.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this licentiate thesis is to study {{the theory of the}} nested multinomial logit model and to apply the model in the {{analysis}} of the labour market transitions of ageing unemployed. The nested multinomial logit model is based on the theory of stochastic utility maximisation. According to the theory of stochastic utility maximisation, each type of exit out of unemployment yields a certain amount of utility to an individual. An individual who maximises this utility chooses the type of exit that yields the highest utility. Using a discrete choice model that is based on the theory of stochastic utility maximisation it is possible to estimate the probability with which an individual chooses a particular type of exit from unemployment. The nested multinomial logit model generalises the multinomial logit model by allowing correlation between the random terms related to the utility functions of different exit types. The idea of the model is to divide the exit types into groups so that the types acting as close substitutes to each other belong to the same group. Correlation is allowed between the types that belong to the same group. The model’s idea is well suited for empirical findings about ageing people’s behaviour in the labour market. The empirical part of the study examines the factors affecting the types of exit from unemployment among the ageing. The main focus is on how economic incentives, like the expected wage or type of unemployment benefit, affect the type of exit. A further theme of interest is the effect of manpower policy measures on the type of exit among the ageing. A multinomial logit model and three different nested multinomial logit models were estimated in the empirical part. The best model {{turned out to be one}} where the <b>unemployment</b> <b>pension</b> and manpower policy measures form a group. The implied correlation between <b>unemployment</b> <b>pension</b> and manpower policy measures means that the ageing regard these exit types as substitutes to each other. According to the analysis, economic incentives have a strong impact on the type of exit from unemployment among the ageing. Age at the beginning of a spell of unemployment is also an important explanatory factor. <b>Unemployment</b> <b>pension</b> is the most probable type of exit among those aged 56 or more at the beginning of a spell of unemployment. The most probable type of exit among people aged 49 to 55 at the beginning of an unemployment spell varies according to their type of unemployment benefit. Manpower policy measures are the most probable type of exit among those on earnings-related unemployment benefit. With those on basic unemployment benefit, the most probable type of exit is employment. According to the analysis, manpower policy measures prior to the spell of unemployment do not affect the probability of becoming employed. References: McFadden,D. (1978).

The deadweight costs of such spending, and the taxes behind them, fail to show the predicted upward spiral.

40|$|The Finnish {{pension system}} is {{structured}} mainly with a pay-as-you-go –principle. Accordingly, the working population pays the pensions of the already retired population. If {{there is a}} change in the worker-retiree –ratio, financing of the pension system can become problematic. Therefore, the timing of retirement or the average retirement age matters. The decision to retire is influenced by a number of economic and non-economic factors. This thesis focuses on the economic incentives of retirement. The thesis uses large panel data sets to construct these incentives for the Finnish population. The aim of the study is to assess how much these incentives affect the probability of retirement. The first essay divides retirement into retirement with the disability pension, with the <b>unemployment</b> <b>pension</b> and with the old-age pension. Higher replacement rate increases the conditional probability of retirement, but this relationship is non-monotonic. Most clearly the replacement rate increases the probability of retirement through the <b>unemployment</b> <b>pension,</b> and it has no effect on the timing of the old-age retirement. The second essay shows that ignoring the difference between disability application and transition probability produces results that are halfway between the two. The essay also tests the impact of a number of different life-cycle incentives. Results on the pure life-cycle incentives are counter-intuitive, whereas the option value results are of the expected sign. The third essay considers part-time retirement. Financial compensation is estimated for each individual in full-time work, part-time work and in full-time retirement. Results show that the part-time pension has been financially most advantageous to those who chose this option. The essay also estimates that fifty per cent of the partially retired would have chosen full-time retirement, had they not had the part-time option. The fourth essay takes also the employer incentives into account. It tests an implicit contracts model on a linked employer-employee panel data. Results show that joint incentives of early retirement matter more when the economic conditions are bad. The essay also shows that experience-rating of the displacements affects the firm behaviour.

The job flows are characterised in terms of employee age and education. The outflow of workers from employment occurs mainly through unemployment, unemployment pensions or disability pensions. The purpose is to examine how the pressures for change, caused by depression and restructuring during the 90 s, were reflected in the use of the aged labour force. The study shows that the aged workers had a considerably higher propensity to loose their jobs than Finnish employees in general. The unemployment pensioners and disability pensioners tend to have shorter educational histories than the Finnish workers in general. The withdrawal into unemployment and retirement as a whole does not depend on firm size. Firms instead use the method which is least costly.

With hindsight scholars, judges, journalists, trade union representatives, shareholders or bankers may conclude that an acquisition was too big, an investment too risky, reorganization too late, or that the management was not capable of doing its job. Bad faith might play a role. Administrators 1 often detect fraud or serious negligence. In large bankruptcies like Enron, WorldCom, Parmalat or Lehman Brothers, billions of US dollars were at stake. Such cases are rare. Mostly the amounts are much smaller, but there are definitely many of such small bankruptcies. Severe losses may be suffered by trade creditors, banks, bondholders, the tax authorities and social securities agencies. More important than {{the amount of money}} involved might be the damage inflicted on human beings as a consequence of bankruptcy (Argenti, 1976).

Displacements occur only when joint utility of the two parties are greater for displacement than for continued employment. We use a firm-worker -panel to test two implications of our model. First, we find that firms target their layoffs on employees who lose least when displaced. This targeting is more frequent in firms in financial distress and during a recession. Second, we find that a change in a disability risk affects also the displacement probability.

40|$|Background: A {{substantial}} number of myocardial infarctions (MI) occur at working age. It is, however, insufficiently well known {{how many of these}} patients return to work after their MI. Methods: Sources of information were the Hospital Discharge Register, the Causes of Death Register and the registers for social security benefits. Availability for the labour market was used as the return to work criterion. Altogether 10, 244 persons (8, 733 men, 1, 511 women) aged 35 – 59 years had their first MI or coronary death during 1991 – 1994 in Finland. Persons who survived for 28 days and were not on pension at the time of MI were included in a two-year follow-up.

40|$|The {{extension}} of work careers {{is one of}} the key targets of social policy in the EU as well as in Finnish national policy-making. But how is this objective of lengthened work life received at the workplace level? This study examines the aim of extending working careers at an organizational level. The data comprise interviews with human resources managers, shop stewards, and employees reaching the end of their working life, conducted in ten Finnish work organizations. Four different age policy lines can be distinguished from the data. First, the age policy practices of manufacturing enterprises are very much alike in that a clear turn has occurred from favoring the <b>unemployment</b> <b>pension</b> path in the case of dismissals to extending working careers. Second, the age policy of public sector organizations encourages investment in extending the working careers of older employees, though young people are clearly preferred in recruitment. The third line can be found in private service sector enterprises that utilize age segmentation based on the age of their customers – young waiters for young customers, for example – while the fourth can be described by the words ‘situation-specific’ and ‘passive’. No input is made into extending working careers and the unemployment route is used as the means of dismissal where needed. The study reveals that the organizations’ age policies are strategic in nature: longer working careers are supported and older people are hired only if it is strategically sound. It can be said that workplaces currently determine the boundaries of who and at what age people are fit for work and of ‘working age’...|$|E
