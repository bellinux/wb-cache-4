30|$|In this article, we have <b>proposed</b> <b>the</b> {{variable}} packet {{splitting method}} in the multi-relay cooperative communications with DF and DAF. <b>The</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> obtains <b>the</b> space diversity {{by using the}} multi-relay cooperative communications. Moreover, since <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> uses <b>the</b> error correcting code and interleaving, obtains also the coding gain.

30|$|We {{draw the}} {{following}} conclusions from Tables  2 and  3. First, the new IQA method correlates well with human opinion scores over all four publicly available image databases; the overall results of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> are in <b>the</b> best two results {{except for the}} SROCC on TID 2008. Second, in the first average case <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> performs better than its competitors. In the second average case, <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> performs better than its competitors in LCC. Meanwhile, {{in this case the}} SROCC average performance of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> is only 0.0422 worse than the ILNIQE. Third, the SROCC values of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> are in <b>the</b> best two results for JPEG and GBLUR on LIVE 2, WN and GBLUR on CSIQ, and JEPG 2000 on TID 2008. The LCC values of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> are in <b>the</b> best two values for JPEG and GBLUR on LIVE 2, WN on CSIQ, and JPEG 2000 on TID 2008. Even in other circumstances where the prediction results are not in the best two, the results of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> maintain competitiveness. Fourth, <b>the</b> newly <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> outperforms LQF for almost all distortion types. Hence, the features we choose for the construction of the visual word dictionary are more quality aware. Fifth, when aimed at multiple distortion types, <b>the</b> newly <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> is adaptable and has an obvious advantage; the SROCC and LCC metrics for <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> are among <b>the</b> best two results. Additionally, the two metrics are approximately 0.9 in the comparison experiments conducted on the LiveMD 1 database.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a new {{adaptive}} distributed video coder {{has been}} proposed, with hierarchical GOP structure. In <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> algorithm, <b>the</b> PSI can be reconstructed in the encoder, using reference key frames and MVs without motion estimation. Therefore, we can estimate the exact accuracies of SI frames with the PSI frames. With the PSI frames, <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> performs RD competition and selects the best coding mode. Based on the decided coding mode, the best GOP structure is automatically decided in <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> reduces <b>the</b> {{number of key}} frames when a video has little and/or linear motion, the performance of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> improves. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> reduces <b>the</b> number of WZ frames, if large motion between consecutive frames occurs, because an SI frame of low accuracy requires many parity bits for error correction. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> has higher performance than the several existing <b>methods.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>method</b> requires high computational complexity, according to the initial GOP size. For further work, we would optimize the encoding, decoding, and SI generation modules, for reduction of the delay.|$|R
