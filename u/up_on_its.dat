5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} now {{considered to have}} been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether it could have reared <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> hind legs, using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage. This has been proposed by Bakker and opposed by Carpenter. A study by Mallison (2010) found support a rearing up posture in Kentrosaurus, though not for ability for the tail {{to act as a}} tripod.|$|E

Thirteen people were injured. A signalman was blamed for the accident as he failed to ensure that the line was clear for the passenger train.|$|E
5|$|A full-grown Scelidosaurus {{was rather}} small {{compared}} to most later non-avian dinosaurs, {{but it was a}} medium-sized species in the Early Jurassic. Some scientists have estimated a length of 4metres (13ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a body length of 3.8 metres (12.5ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes. Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> hind legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway from the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism than previously thought.|$|E

5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> hind legs to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, {{in a way it}} resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{an object}} that is either a planet or a brown dwarf in the orbit of the star HIP 78530. It was {{observed}} as early as 2000, but the object was not confirmed as one in orbit of the star HIP 78530 until a direct imaging project photographed the star in 2008. The image {{caught the attention of}} the project's science team, so the team followed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> initial observations. HIP 78530 b orbits a young, hot, bright blue star in the Upper Scorpius association. The planet itself is over twenty-three times more massive than Jupiter, orbiting eighteen times further from its host star than Pluto does from the Sun by the estimates published in its discovery paper. In this predicted orbit, HIP 78530 b completes an orbit every twelve thousand years.|$|E
5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E

5|$|Opisthocoelicaudia {{may have}} been able to rear <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> hindlimbs for foraging, using its tail as a third leg. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka cited several {{skeletal}} features that might have been related to rearing, including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this author, would have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of the pelvis, such as the thickened shelf of the acetabulum, the flaring ilia, and the fused pubic symphysis, may have allowed the pelvis to withstand the stress of rearing.|$|E
