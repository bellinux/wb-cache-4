25|$|By {{the early}} 1980s users began seeing Unix as a {{potential}} universal operating system, suitable for computers of all sizes. The <b>Unix</b> <b>environment</b> and the client–server program model were essential elements {{in the development of}} the Internet and the reshaping of computing as centered in networks rather than in individual computers.|$|E
25|$|RNA-Seq {{experiments}} {{generate a}} {{large volume of}} raw sequence reads, which have to be processed to yield useful information. Data analysis usually requires a combination of bioinformatics software tools (see also List of RNA-Seq bioinformatics tools) that {{vary according to the}} experimental design and goals. The process can be broken down into four stages: quality control, alignment, quantification, and differential expression. Most popular RNA-Seq programs are run from a command-line interface, either in a <b>Unix</b> <b>environment</b> or within the R/Bioconductor statistical environment.|$|E
25|$|Adobe Acrobat is {{one example}} of {{proprietary}} software that allows the user to annotate, highlight, and add notes to already created PDF files. One UNIX application available as free software (under the GNU General Public License) is PDFedit. Another GPL-licensed application native to the <b>unix</b> <b>environment</b> is Xournal. Xournal allows for annotating in different fonts and colours, as well as a rule for quickly underlining and highlighting lines of text or paragraphs. Xournal also has a shape recognition tool for squares, rectangles and circles. In Xournal annotations may be moved, copied and pasted. The freeware Foxit Reader, available for Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux, allows annotating documents. Tracker Software's PDF-XChange Viewer allows annotations and markups without restrictions in its freeware alternative. Apple's macOS's integrated PDF viewer, Preview, does also enable annotations as does the freeware Skim, with the latter supporting interaction with LaTeX, SyncTeX, and PDFSync and integration with BibDesk reference management software. Freeware Qiqqa can create an annotation report that summarizes all the annotations and notes one has made across their library of PDFs.|$|E

2500|$|Instead of the [...] and [...] keys, Apple Keyboards have [...] (command) and [...] keys. The [...] key is used {{much like}} the , and the [...] key like the [...] on IBM PCs, to access menu options and shortcuts. Macs have a [...] key for {{compatibility}} with programs that expect a more traditional keyboard layout. It is especially useful when using a terminal, X11 (a <b>Unix</b> <b>environment</b> included with OS X as an install option) or MS Windows. The key can generally be used to produce a secondary mouse click as well. There is also a [...] key on modern Mac keyboards, which is used for switching between use of the , , etc. keys either as function keys or for other functions like media control, accessing dashboard widgets, controlling the volume, or handling exposé. [...] key can be also found on many IBM PC laptops, where it serves a similar purpose.|$|E
