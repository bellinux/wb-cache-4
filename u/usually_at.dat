5|$|After {{incubating}} {{for around}} 80 days, hatchlings dig through the sand to the surface, <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> night, when darkness increases {{the chance of}} escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced. Hatchlings enter the ocean by navigating toward the brighter horizon created by {{the reflection of the}} moon and starlight off the water's surface.|$|E
5|$|Beetles are {{the most}} widely eaten insects, with about 344 species used as food, <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> the larval stage. The {{mealworm}} (the larva of the darkling beetle) and the rhinoceros beetle are among the species commonly eaten.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the smaller}} insectivorous birds {{including}} the warblers, hummingbirds and flycatchers migrate large distances, <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> night. They land {{in the morning and}} may feed for a few days before resuming their migration. The birds are referred to as passage migrants in the regions where they occur for short durations between the origin and destination.|$|E
50|$|The two {{government}} regulated {{educational qualifications}} are the Junior Certificate (<b>usually</b> taken <b>at</b> 15/16) and the Leaving Certificate (<b>usually</b> taken <b>at</b> {{between the ages}} of 17 and 19).|$|R

5|$|T.chatareus {{are known}} to occur in shaded areas with {{vegetation}} overhead, <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> {{the top layer of}} the water column. They are found only where there is an intact riparian area, as this is a major source of their food. T.chatareus are usually not found in fast-flowing streams.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{far from}} land are tracked by weather satellites capturing visible and infrared images from space, <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> half-hour to quarter-hour intervals. As a storm approaches land, {{it can be}} observed by land-based Doppler weather radar. Radar {{plays a crucial role}} around landfall by showing a storm's location and intensity every several minutes.|$|E
5|$|According to Expanded Universe material, the {{peaceful}} Mon Calamari converted their passenger liners into warships {{to support the}} rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Expanded Universe texts state that the ships are crewed almost entirely by Mon Calamari due to the ships' Mon Calamari-oriented controls and interface. The primary opponent of Mon Calamari cruisers are the Imperial Star Destroyers. Although Mon Calamari cruisers are roughly {{the same size as}} most Imperial Destroyers, in head-to-head engagements the Mon Calamari cruisers are <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> a disadvantage, due to their thinner armor. Even so, Mon Calamari cruisers are still a formidable threat to the Imperial fleet; their large numbers of fighter squadrons, modular weapons systems and overlapping shields make them ideal for hit-and-run attacks on Imperial ships, bases, and military outposts.|$|E

5|$|April 8 through April 10. The Feast of the Three Days of the Writing of the Book of the Law. These {{three days}} are {{commemorative}} {{of the three}} days in the year 1904 during which Aleister Crowley wrote the Book of the Law. One chapter was written each day, the first being written on April 8, the second on April 9, and the third on April 10. Although there is no official way of celebrating any Thelemic holiday, this particular feast day is usually celebrated by reading the corresponding chapter {{on each of the}} three days, <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> noon.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{climbing}} {{walls are}} used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> climbing gyms. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on 26 June 1922, Asama resumed making {{training}} cruises, <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> two-year intervals, {{that took}} her to Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean Sea among other places. They {{came to an end}} after she ran aground on the night of 13 October 1935 north north-west of the Kurushima Strait in the Inland Sea. Her bottom was badly damaged and she was deemed no longer seaworthy after repairs were completed at Kure Naval Arsenal. The ship was then assigned as a stationary training ship for the Kure Naval Corps on 5 July 1938.|$|E

50|$|Suicides on tracks {{may take}} place through the person either jumping onto, walking, lying or {{sitting on the}} tracks. Lying on the tracks may result in decapitation. Accidents {{resulting}} from people jumping onto the tracks <b>usually</b> occur <b>at</b> daytime. Accidents including people walking, lying or sitting on the tracks <b>usually</b> occur <b>at</b> night when the driver's visibility is reduced, reducing {{the chance of a}} failed suicide. People who commit suicide in this manner <b>usually</b> stay <b>at</b> or around the place for the suicide {{for an extended period of}} time before the actual suicide.|$|R
5|$|Bridges {{and other}} key points were {{prepared}} for demolition at short notice by preparing chambers filled with explosives. A Depth Charge Crater was a site in a road (<b>usually</b> <b>at</b> a junction) prepared with buried explosives that could be detonated to instantly form a deep crater as an anti-tank obstacle. The Canadian pipe mine (later known as the McNaughton Tube after General Andrew McNaughton) was a horizontally bored pipe packed with explosives– once in place this {{could be used to}} instantly ruin a road or runway. Prepared demolitions had the advantage of being undetectable from the air—the enemy could not take any precautions against them, or plot a route of attack around them.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during {{the last half of}} the night, and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night. During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal torpor.|$|E
5|$|In {{science as}} in everything, {{small-scale}} synthesizers usually get credit from all constituent parties, but truly great synthesizers can fall between {{the cracks in}} the cycle of scientific credit. Ledyard Stebbins was in the latter category; neither fish nor fowl, he frequently failed to receive credit for work in some areas, <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> the hands of narrower colleagues. Few, however, have challenged his contributions to plant evolutionary biology, nor questioned his ability to synthesize disparate literature into a coherent framework. His ability to read quickly, recognize novel insights, digest new material, and then integrate the knowledge were the hallmarks of his scientific work style. He was a masterful synthesizer and master of the review essay or synthetic thought piece.|$|E

In the next match against New South Wales, Harvey played with Neil {{for the first}} time at {{first-class}} level, and pair played together for their state’s two remaining matches of the season, although they never batted together as Merv was always out before Neil came in, <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> No. 6. Merv made 30 and 44, failing to capitalise on his starts to make a big score with a Test vacancy beckoning; incumbent opener Sid Barnes was injured and unavailable for the Fourth Test.|$|E
5|$|Mobile data {{terminal}} – Some ambulances are fitted with Mobile {{data terminal}}s (or MDTs), which are connected wirelessly {{to a central}} computer, <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> the control center. These terminals can function instead of or alongside the two-way radio {{and can be used}} to pass details of jobs to the crew, and can log the time the crew was mobile to a patient, arrived, and left scene, or fulfill any other computer based function.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Green flees {{her wedding}} day and seeks out {{childhood}} friend Monica Geller, a New York City chef. They become roommates, and Rachel joins Monica's social circle of single people in their mid-20s: struggling actor Joey Tribbiani, business professional Chandler Bing, masseuse and musician Phoebe Buffay, and newly divorced paleontologist Ross Geller, Monica's older brother. To support herself, Rachel becomes a waitress at Central Perk, a Manhattan coffeehouse where the group often hangs out; when not there, the six are <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> Monica and Rachel's nearby West Village apartment, or Joey and Chandler's across the hall.|$|E

A second series broadcast {{the following year}} included Live Fast Die Young about famous musicians who died {{before the age of}} 30, Legendary Labels about major record labels and From Cleethorpes to California about record producer Rod Temperton. The station's documentaries won a bronze award in the Programmes and Series Promotion category at the 2009 New York Festivals International Radio Program Awards.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Air Patrol's core cadet {{activity}} is the summer encampment. Typically a seven to ten day event, cadets {{are put into}} an intense, military-structured environment with emphasis on physically and mentally demanding tasks, in addition to required classes and activities. These classes include aerospace education, United States Air Force organization, cadet programs, and drug demand reduction. Activities include the classroom courses, physical training, leadership development, and drill & ceremonies. Encampments are usually held at the wing (state) level and, when available are <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> military installations, preferably active United States Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command or Air National Guard installations, with military support.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Ministry {{estimated}} {{there were}} 750,000 Mischlinge as of April 1935 (studies done {{after the war}} put the number of Mischlinge at around 200,000). As Jews {{became more and more}} excluded from German society, they organised social events, schools, and activities of their own. Economic problems were not so easily solved, however; many Jewish firms went out of business due to lack of customers. This was part of the ongoing Aryanization process (the transfer of Jewish firms to non-Jewish owners, <b>usually</b> <b>at</b> prices far below market value) that the regime had initiated in 1933, which intensified after the Nuremberg Laws were passed. Former middle-class or wealthy business owners were forced to take employment in menial jobs to support their families, and many were unable to find work at all.|$|E
