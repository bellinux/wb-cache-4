40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{different}} tax systems adopted by countries, foreign-sourced income earned by taxpayers may be subject to double taxation. This may therefore impede cross-border trade and investment. Double taxation relief is provided unilaterally, in terms of a countryâ€™s domestic laws or bilaterally in terms of Double Taxation Agreements. South African residents earning income from the Democratic Republic of Congo may be subject to tax in both countries. To eliminate such double taxation the South African Income Tax Act, No 58 of 1962, provides for <b>unilateral</b> <b>relief</b> from double taxation in the form of exemptions, rebates and deductions. The double tax agreement between South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo came into effect recently and double taxation relief for South African residents is now also available in terms of tax treaty law. The objective of the research was to determine whether the combination of the unilateral measures and the double tax agreement provide relief in respect of all types of income earned by South African residents in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was concluded that the double tax agreement, together with the <b>unilateral</b> <b>relief</b> provided for in the Income Tax Act will grant relief for all types of income earned by South African residents in the Democratic Republic of the Congo...|$|E
40|$|I {{discuss the}} tax {{treatment}} of transborder capital income, focussing on prevailing arrangements rather than de novo design of optimal tax arrangements. These comprise <b>unilateral</b> <b>reliefs</b> from double taxation under credit or exemption systems, and treaty reliefs (largely following the OECD model treaty) which jointly lower withholding tax rates on interest, dividends, and royalties in both host and source countries. I {{suggest that these}} arrangements involve both seemingly non-strategic unilateral actions and cooperative arrangements which are difficult to reconcile both with tax competition literature and with national interest. I pose four puzzles in this regard. The first is that from a national welfare point of view, the <b>unilateral</b> <b>reliefs</b> in use seem inferior to no relief since with competitive markets investors equate the private return on investments at home and abroad, while tax revenues largely accrue to the foreign government. Private returns are equated, but national returns are not. The second is that tax treaties only have lump sum effects between national governments if the more common credit arrangements of <b>unilateral</b> <b>reliefs</b> apply and if tax rates are similar in host and source countries (approximately the OECD situation). This raises the issue of why governments negotiate them. The third is the sharp contrast to international treaty arrangements for goods flows under the WTO; and the fourth {{is the absence of}} side payments in tax treaties. The picture emerging is that making sense of present arrangements from a national welfare point of view and in terms of efficient instrument design seems difficult. The gap relative to optimal tax considerations also seems large. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for analyzing international-income taxation. The standard approach, involving the user cost of capital, is extended to incorporate the role of tax policy implemented by the home country. Tax provisions of home countries vary significantly. Of particular relevance are: (a) whether remitted earnings are taxed at home; (b) if so, whether they receive any <b>unilateral</b> tax <b>relief,</b> that is, deduction or foreign tax credit; (c) whether the home country accepts tax sparing; and (d) the scope and extent of deductible expenses, which generally {{differ from those of}} the host. Also of interest to the host are firms'international tax planning opportunities. Thailand has sought and achieved double-taxation agreement with most of its trading partners. It has attracted substantial foreign investments and collected the attendant revenue. Its tax policy remains vulnerable in many areas, however. There are, for example, inadequate safeguards against excessive leverage, transfer pricing, and treaty shopping. Its strategy concerning tax incentives could also be strengthened to remove the barriers for extending the treaty network and enhancing regional coordination.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Spinal intradural-extramedullary {{neoplasms}} are uncommon lesions {{that usually}} cause pain or neurological deficit secondary to neural compression. Tradi-tional treatment of these tumors includes open laminectomy with intradural resection. We describe an alternative minimally invasive surgical technique in a consecutive series of patients undergoing treatment for symptomatic lesions. METHODS: Six patients (four men, two women) presented with symptoms including pain (five out of six) and/or neurological deficit (two out of six) with radiographic evidence of intradural pathology. All patients underwent surgical resection using a minimally invasive, <b>unilateral</b> approach. Pain <b>relief</b> was analyzed using the visual analog scale and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} to evaluate the extent of resection. Traditional laminectomy for tumor resection disrupts the muscular, ligamentous, and bony structures of the spine, which may contribute to pain and instability. Minimally invasive resection of intradural tumors offers the option of reducing approach mor-bidity when resecting these lesions. Using a tubular retractor system (X-Tube, Medtronic Sofamor-Danek, Memphis, TN) and microscopic surgical techniques, w...|$|R
