40|$|The {{management}} of massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears is challenging. They {{are associated with}} persistent defects, weakness, and poor outcomes, and can cause an <b>uncoupling</b> of <b>forces</b> across the glenohumeral joint, with unstable shoulder kinematics. There has been much interest {{in the development of}} scaffolds to bridge massive rotator cuff tears. As allograft materials may produce inflammatory responses in the host, there is notable interest in developing synthetic grafts for surgical use. Benefits and limitations of the available synthetic scaffolds for augmentation of rotator cuff tears are reported in the present review...|$|R
40|$|We review both {{present and}} past motions at major plate boundaries, {{which have the}} {{horizontal}} component in average 10 to 100 times faster (10 &ndash; 100 &nbsp;mm/yr) than the vertical component (0. 01 &ndash; 1 &nbsp;mm/yr) in all geodynamic settings. The steady faster horizontal velocity of the lithosphere {{with respect to the}} upward or downward velocities at plate boundaries supports dominating tangential forces acting on plates. This suggests a passive role of plate boundaries with respect to far field forces determining the velocity of plates. The forces acting on the lithosphere can be subdivided in coupled and uncoupled, {{as a function of the}} shear at the lithosphere base. Higher the asthenosphere viscosity, more significant should be the coupled forces, i. e., the mantle drag and the trench suction. Lower the asthenosphere viscosity, more the effects of <b>uncoupled</b> <b>forces</b> might result determinant, i. e., the ridge push, the slab pull and the tidal drag. Although a combination of all forces acting on the lithosphere is likely, the decoupling between lithosphere and mantle suggests that a torque acts on the lithosphere independently of the mantle drag. Slab pull and ridge push are candidates for generating this torque, but, unlike these boundary forces, the advantage of the tidal drag is to be a volume force, acting simultaneously on the whole plates, and being the decoupling at the lithosphere base controlled by lateral variations in viscosity of the low-velocity layer...|$|R

40|$|Ourability to skillfullymanipulate anobject often {{involves}} themotor system learning {{to compensate for}} thedynamics of theobject. When the two arms learn tomanipulate a single object they can act cooperatively, whereas when theymanipulate separate objects they control each object independently. We examined how learning transfers between these two bimanual contexts by applying force fields to the arms. In a coupled context, a single dynamic is shared between the arms, and in anuncoupled context separate dynamics are experienced independently by each arm. In a composition experiment, we found that when subjects had learned <b>uncoupled</b> <b>force</b> fields theywere able to transfer to a coupled field that was {{the sum of the}} two fields. However, the contribution of each arm repartitioned over time so that, when they returned to the uncoupled fields, the error initially increased but rapidly reverted to the previous level. In a decomposition experiment, after subjects learned a coupled field, their error increased when exposed to uncoupled fields that were orthogonal compo-nents of the coupled field. However, when the coupled field was reintroduced, subjects rapidly readapted. These results suggest that the representations of dynamics for uncoupled and coupled contexts are partially independent. We found additional support for this hypothesis by showing significant learning of opposing curl fields when the context, coupled versus uncoupled, was alternated with the curl field direction. These results suggest that the motor system is able to use partially separate representations for dynamics of the two arms acting on a single object and two arms acting on separate objects.

40|$|The {{safety factor}} (SF) is an {{indicator}} of the safeness of electrical conduction in the myocardium. In the present work, we have studied the sensitivity of the SF defined by Shaw and Rudy to the integration interval (II) using computer simulations, and then defined and evaluated a new and simplified method to calculate SF (SFm). Our results reveal that the sensitivity of the SF to the II is negligible outside the depolarization phase, delimited by the instant when membrane potential derivative (dV/dt) reaches 1 % of its maximum (t 1 %) and the instant when membrane potential is maximum (tVmax), so we have computed the SF considering this II. Our SFm shows a desirable behaviour as a) it drops below unity when propagation failure occurs and b) the SFm registered during normoxia decreases when membrane excitability is reduced, and increases when high cell <b>uncoupling</b> is <b>forced.</b> This computational simplification could facilitate the use of the SF in heterogeneous 2 D and 3 D tissues...|$|R
40|$|Exposure of relaxed rat {{extensor}} digitorum longus (EDL; predominantly fast-twitch) {{muscle to}} {{temperatures in the}} upper physiological range for mammalian skeletal muscle (43 - 46 °C) led to reversible alterations of the contractile activation properties. These properties were studied using the mechanically skinned fibre preparation activated in Ca 2 +-buffered solutions. The maximum Ca 2 +-activated force (maximum force per cross-sectional area) and the steepness of force-pCa (-log 10 [Ca 2 +]) curves {{as measured by the}} Hill coefficient (nH) reversibly decreased by factors of 8 and 2. 5, respectively, when the EDL muscle was treated at 43 °C for 30 min and 5 and 2. 8, respectively, with treatment at 46 °C for 5 min. Treatment at 47 °C for 5 min produced an even more marked depression in maximum specific force, which fully recovered after treatment, and in the Hill coefficient, which did not recover after treatment. After all temperature treatments there was no change in the level of [Ca 2 +] at which 50 % maximum force was generated. The temperature-induced depression in force production and steepness of the force-pCa curves were shown to be associated with superoxide (O 2 −) production in muscle (apparent rate of O 2 − production at room temperature, 0. 055 ± 0. 008 nmol min− 1 (g wet weight) − 1; and following treatment to 46 °C for 5 min, 1. 8 ± 0. 2 nmol min− 1 (g wet weight) − 1) because 20 mm Tiron, a membrane-permeant O 2 − scavenger, was able to markedly suppress the net rate of O 2 − production and prevent any temperature-induced depression of contractile parameters. The temperature-induced depression in force production of the contractile apparatus could be reversed either by allowing the intact muscle to recover for 3 - 4 h at room temperature or by treatment of the skinned fibre preparation with dithiothreitol (a potent reducing agent) in the relaxing solution. These results demonstrate that mammalian skeletal muscle has the ability to <b>uncouple</b> <b>force</b> production reversibly from the activator Ca 2 + as the temperature increases in the upper physiological range through an increase in O 2 − production...|$|R
40|$|The pen {{is a very}} useful, comfortable, {{quick and}} {{portable}} output device. Even in a world with Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and laptops in abundance, many people still prefer pens for situations like taking notes in a lecture or a business meeting or for sketching an idea. A pen product has been developed that takes writing and produces voltages related to the direction vectors of the writing. The idea to use direction vectors to produce ASCII characters through handwriting recognition is unique. Though {{it seems like a}} complex problem, there are few ambiguities in the direction vectors used to write letters. Additionally many of the ambiguities of similar-looking letters would not exist because the strokes used to write them are different. Tests show that the X- and Y- coordinates of the outputs are <b>uncoupled</b> when <b>forces</b> are applied while the pen is held vertical and stationary but somewhat coupled while one is writing. Preliminary tests also show that the voltage plots can distinguish between the lines in a box, a horizontal line and a diagonal line, the two lines in an X, and the letters U and V. by Adrian N.

40|$|Wetting paths {{imparted}} by {{the natural}} environment and/or human activities affect the state of soils in the near-surface, promoting transitions across different regimes of saturation. This paper discusses a set of techniques aimed at quantifying the role of hydrologic processes on the hydro-mechanical stability of soil specimens subjected to saturation events. Emphasis {{is given to the}} mechanical conditions leading to coupled flow/deformation instabilities. For this purpose, energy balance arguments for three-phase systems are used to derive second-order work expressions applicable to various regimes of saturation. Controllability analyses are then performed to relate such work input with constitutive singularities that reflect the loss of strength under coupled and/or <b>uncoupled</b> hydro-mechanical <b>forcing.</b> A suction-dependent plastic model is finally used to track the evolution of stability conditions in samples subjected to wetting, thus quantifying the growth of the potential for coupled failure modes upon increasing degree of saturation. These findings are eventually linked with the properties of the field equations that govern pore pressure transients, thus disclosing a conceptual link between the onset of coupled hydro-mechanical failures and the evolution of suction with time. Such results point out that mathematical instabilities caused by a non-linear suction dependent behaviour {{play an important role in}} the advanced constitutive and/or numerical tools that are commonly used for the analysis of geomechanical problems in the unsaturated zone, and further stress that the relation between suction transients and soil deformations is a key factor for the interpretation of runaway failures caused by intense saturation events...|$|R
40|$|Ionic Polymer Metal Composites (IPMCs) {{consist of}} an ionomeric membrane, {{including}} mobile counterions, sandwiched between two thin noble metal electrodes. IPMCs find application as sensors and actuators, where an imposed mechanical loading generates a voltage across the electrodes, and, vice versa, an imposed electric field causes deformation. Here, {{we present a}} predictive modelling approach to elucidate the dynamic sensing response of IPMCs subject to a time-varying through-the-thickness compression ("compression sensing"). The model relies on the continuum theory recently developed by Porfiri and co-workers, which couples finite deformations to the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system governing the IPMC electrochemistry. For the "compression sensing" problem we establish a perturbative closed-form solution along with a Finite Element (FE) solution. The systematic comparison between these two solutions is a central contribution of this study, offering insight on accuracy and mathematical complexity. The method of matched asymptotic expansions is employed to find the analytical solution. To this end, we <b>uncouple</b> the <b>force</b> balance from the modified PNP system and separately linearise the PNP equations in the ionomer bulk and in the boundary layers at the ionomer-electrode interfaces. Comparison with FE results for the fully coupled nonlinear system demonstrates {{the accuracy of the}} analytical solution to describe IPMC sensing for moderate deformation levels. We finally demonstrate the potential of the modelling scheme to accurately reproduce experimental results from the literature. The proposed model is expected to aid in the design of IPMC sensors, contribute to an improved understanding of IPMC electrochemomechanical response, and offer insight into the role of nonlinear phenomena across mechanics and electrochemistry...|$|R
40|$|Endogenous {{hydrogen}} sulfide (H 2 S) {{is involved in}} the regulation of vascular tone. We hypothesized that lowering of calcium and opening of K channels as well as calcium-independent mechanisms are involved in H 2 S-induced relaxation in rat mesenteric small arteries. Amperometric recordings revealed that free [H 2 S] after addition to closed tubes of NaSH, Na 2 S, and GYY 4137 were, respectively, 14 %, 17 %, and 1 % of added amount. The compounds caused equipotent relaxations in isometric myographs, but based on the measured free [H 2 S], GYY 4137 caused more relaxation in relation to released free [H 2 S] than NaSH and Na 2 S in rat mesenteric small arteries. Simultaneous measurements of [H 2 S] and tension showed that 15 μM of free H 2 S caused 61 % relaxation in superior mesenteric arteries. Simultaneous measurements of smooth muscle calcium and tension revealed that NaSH lowered calcium and caused relaxation of norepinephrine-contracted arteries, while high extracellular potassium reduced NaSH relaxation without corresponding calcium changes. In norepinephrine-contracted arteries, NaSH (1 mM) lowered phosphorylation of myosin light chain, while phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT- 1) remained unchanged. Inhibitors of guanylate cyclase, protein kinase A and G failed to reduce NaSH relaxation, while blockers of voltage-gated KV 7 channels inhibited NaSH relaxation, and blockers of mitochondrial complex I and III abolished NaSH relaxation. CONCLUSION: the present findings suggest that low micromolar concentrations of free H 2 S by a dual mechanism opens K channels followed by lowering of smooth muscle calcium and by a mechanism involving mitochondrial complex I and III leads to <b>uncoupling</b> of <b>force,</b> and hence vasodilation...|$|R
40|$|The land surface {{component}} of the hydrological cycle is fundamental to the overall functioning of the atmospheric and climate processes. Spatially and temporally variable rainfall and available energy, combined with land surface heterogeneity cause complex variations in all processes related to surface hydrology. The characterization of the spatial and temporal variability of water and energy cycles are critical to improve our understanding of land surface-atmosphere interaction {{and the impact of}} land surface processes on climate extremes. Because the accurate knowledge of these processes and their variability is important for climate predictions, most Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) centers have incorporated land surface schemes in their models. However, errors in the NWP forcing accumulate in the surface and energy stores, leading to incorrect surface water and energy partitioning and related processes. This has motivated the NWP to impose ad hoc corrections to the land surface states to prevent this drift. A proposed methodology is to develop Land Data Assimilation schemes (LDAS), which are <b>uncoupled</b> models <b>forced</b> with observations, and not affected by NWP forcing biases. The proposed research is being implemented as a real time operation using an existing Surface Vegetation Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (SVATS) model at a 40 km degree resolution across the United States to evaluate these critical science questions. The model will be forced with real time output from numerical prediction models, satellite data, and radar precipitation measurements. Model parameters will be derived from the existing GIS vegetation and soil coverages. The model results will be aggregated to various scales to assess water and energy balances and these will be validated with various in-situ observations...|$|R

We hypothesized that the lowering of calcium and opening of potassium (K) channels as well as calcium-independent mechanisms are involved in H 2 S-induced relaxation in rat mesenteric small arteries. Amperometric recordings revealed that free [H 2 S] after addition to closed tubes of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), Na 2 S, and GYY 4137 [P-(4 -methoxyphenyl) -P- 4 -morpholinyl-phosphinodithioic acid] were, respectively, 14 %, 17 %, and 1 % of added amount.

40|$|The recent {{trend towards}} {{the design of}} {{flexible}} footbridges, characterized by a low ratio between permanent and variable load, has made them more sensitive to dynamic forces induced by pedestrians. While walking, the pedestrian moves on the flexible structure adapting his gait to the bridge motion and interacting with the footbridge. At contact points, the pedestrian transmits contact forces to the bridge that, in turn, imposes a set of displacements and velocities to the pedestrian’s feet. The pedestrian is here described with an increasing accuracy. Neglecting the interaction with the bridge, the pedestrian is described with a refined force model, that simulates the force pattern transmitted by each foot. The position of the two forces reproduces the sequence of single and double support phases, typical of the human gait. Interaction is accounted for when both systems are described as mechanical systems (having proper mass, stiffness and damping matrices). In this work a newly proposed bipedal pedestrian mass-spring-damper model is adopted, sharing with the force model {{the same type of}} locomotion. The mechanical system is excited by an equivalent bio-mechanical force and its equation of motion takes into account the interaction with the bridge. The coupled equations of motion of the bridge-pedestrian system are then derived; with a <b>forced</b> <b>uncoupling</b> of the equations, the two systems can be analyzed separately. The case study concerns a lively footbridge, whose dynamic response is computed with the different modeling approaches...|$|R
40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the representation of}} the intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) in three simulations with the ECHAM 4 atmosphere general circulation model (GCM). First, the model is forced by AMIP sea surface temperatures (SST),. then coupled to the OPYC 3 global ocean GCM and third forced by OPYC 3 SSTs to clarify possible air-sea interactions and connections of the ISO and the ENSO cycle. The simulations are compared to ECMWF reanalysis data and NOAA outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) observations. Although previous {{studies have shown that the}} ECHAM 4 GCM simulates an ISO-like oscillation, the main deficits are an overly fast eastward propagation and an eastward displacement of the main ISO activity, which is shown with a composite analysis of daily data between 1984 to 1988 for the reanalysis and the AMIP simulation, 25 years of the coupled integration, and a five year subset of the coupled SST output used for the OPYC 3 forced atmosphere GCM experiment. These deficits are common to many atmospheric GCMs. The composites are obtained by principal oscillation pattern (POP). The POPs are also used to investigate the propagation speed and the interannual variability of the main ISO activity. The present coupled model version reveals no clear improvements in the ISO simulation compared to the <b>uncoupled</b> version <b>forced</b> with OPYC 3 SSTs, although it is shown that the modeled ISO influences the simulated high-frequency SST variability in the coupled GCM. Within the current analysis, ECHAM 4 forced by AMIP SSTs provides the most reasonable ISO simulation. However, it is shown that the maximum amplitudes of the annual cycle of the ISO variability in all analyzed model versions are reached too late in the year (spring and summer) compared to the observations (winter and spring). Additionally, the ENSO cycle influences the interannual variability of the ISO, which is revealed by 20 years of daily reanalysis data and 100 years of the coupled integration. The ENSO cycle is simulated by the coupled model, although there is a roughly I K cold bias in the East Pacific in the coupled model. This leads to a diminished influence of the ENSO cycle on the spatial variability of the modeled ISO activity compared to observations. This points out the strong sensitivity of the SST on the ISO activity. Small biases in the SST appear to cause large deterioration in the modeled IS...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} total knee {{arthroplasty}} are inferior in younger patients. The challenge today is therefore to develop designs and concepts {{that will last}} at least 25 years. This thesis has evaluated the fixation to bone of modern designs of knee prostheses uring RSA analysis. Coating implant surfaces with hydroxy-apatite have proven to enhance fixation to bone. Addition of screws for fixation of the tibial component enhances the fixation, but has negative side effects such as osteolysis around the screws, in turn leading to {{a higher risk of}} component loosening. The magnitude and pattern of migration was studied in a randomized study of uncemented tibial implants coated with hydroxy-apatite with and without additional screw fixation in patients younger than 65 years. The uncemented implants migrated initially more than the cemented implants that constituted the control group. Both uncemented groups stabilized at 3 monthes with no further migration, while the cemented implants showed a continuous migration up to the 2 year follow-up, indicating continuous bone resorption at the implant-bone interface, a fact that might lead to an increased risk of late implant loosening. This may not be a problem in older patients, but may have consequences for long-term fixation in younger patients. There was no difference between the two uncemented groups indicating that screws do not improve fixation. Hydroxy-apatite coated knee implants might be well suited for younger patients. Mobile bearing total knee arthroplasty theoretically <b>uncouples</b> the <b>forces</b> at the implant-bone interface, thus improving fixation of the implant to bone. The magnitude and pattern of migration of a cemented mobile bearing knee arthroplasty and a fixed bearing total knee arthroplasty was compared in a randomized study. The results showed that mobile bearings did not improve fixation. Trabecular metal, a new material recently introduced for total knee arthroplasty, has several theoretical advantages. Trabecular metal tibial implants were evaluated in a randomized study in patients younger than 60 years. The implants displayed the typical migration pattern for uncemented implants with greater migration initially followed by early stabilization. The majority of the trabecular metal implants subsided into the bone with no lift-off. Lift-off has the potential of exposing the interface to joint fluid with the potential risk of bone resorption and late loosening, and is commonly seen in metal-backed implants. The finding of absence of lift-off is regarded beneficial for uncemented fixation. Trabecular metal tibial implants might be suited for younger patients. The optimal mode of fixation of the femoral component is yet to be established. Comparing cemented femoral components with uncemented femoral components in a randomized study in patients younger than 60 years revealed no differences of the magnitude or the pattern of migration. Uncemented femoral component seems equally as good as cemented components in younger patients...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the same}} coupled {{formulation}} of the vehicle-bridge dynamic system, written in total displacements and including {{the effect of the}} pavement roughness profile, two numerical iterative procedures, named WTH and STS, were previously derived, relying {{on the same}} <b>forced</b> <b>uncoupling</b> of the equations of motion. The uncoupled formulation is characterised by time-independent, symmetric matrices. A sufficient generality in the modelling of the two subsystems is retained. A numerical model, not restricted to a particular choice of the adopted elements, describes the bridge; the vehicle is modelled as a multi-body system. Since, in general, the contact points do not coincide with a mesh node, a constraint equation is adopted to relate physical quantities at contact points and at nodes. This work presents the two iterative procedures, that differ in the iteration scheme, performed either on the whole time history (WTH) or in the single time step (STS). The numerical studies concern a 3 D finite element model of a RC bridge, 30 m long, and a 3 D 7 -DOFs model of a vehicle. To highlight the significance of the present work, at first previous results are summarized: a direct comparison of the two procedures, where a good agreement is found, has pointed out the validity of the proposed uncoupled approach, allowing the evaluation of the effects of some parameters, such as vehicle damping, bridge static deflection and the choice of the shape functions adopted to impose the constraint equation. Two important effects are investigated in this work. One is the effect of the transverse distribution of the roughness profiles: a non uniform profile under the left and right wheels is adopted, respecting an isotropic PSD function. The other is the effect of the vehicle position over the bridge deck, considered to be eccentric with respect to the longitudinal symmetry axis of the bridge. Both effects reveal to be important and provides better insight into the bridge-vehicle dynamic interaction...|$|R
