40|$|Tourism is {{a highly}} {{important}} and diverse economic sector. All tourism activity relies directly and indirectly on water resources. While direct water use in hotels, golf courses and other tourism establishments is relatively well researched, the more substantial volumes of water used indirectly to produce goods which cater for tourism demand are poorly understood. The thesis develops and tests three innovative approaches {{as part of its}} overall aim of comprehensively quantifying total (direct and indirect) water demand and water productivity (water use in relation to economic output) across different tourism products. The first approach is based on the water footprint concept and uses readily available data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the Water Footprint Network. The second approach uses statistical segmentation and secondary tourism expenditure data, along with Environmental Input-Output (EIO) analysis, to create distinct tourist groups whose water use and productivity is subsequently compared. The third approach employs primary survey data along with a novel EIO model, in order to quantify the specific impacts of tourist dietary choices. The water scarce island of Cyprus, a popular tourism destination, serves as the central case study. The contribution of the thesis is primarily methodological, producing three methods of differing complexity thus offering a previously <b>unavailable</b> <b>choice</b> to academics and policy makers. Additionally, the approaches generate results with important theoretical and policy implications. Firstly, when both indirect and direct water use is taken into account, cheaper mass tourism is shown to have a higher water productivity compared to higher-spending tourists. With many destinations currently investing in attracting the latter group, this finding is of immediate relevance. Secondly, the findings highlight the importance of obtaining accurate information on dietary preferences in order to better manage the supply chain of key products which account for a significant amount of water consumption...|$|E
5000|$|Goldwyn wanted Grace Kelly for Sarah Brown, the Save-a-Soul sister. When {{she turned}} the part down because of other commitments, Goldwyn tried Deborah Kerr, who was also <b>unavailable.</b> The third <b>choice</b> was Jean Simmons, who had {{recently}} played opposite Brando in Désirée. Goldwyn was surprised by Simmons' sweet voice and strong acting and ultimately believed the love story worked better in the film than onstage. [...] "I'm so happy" [...] he said after seeing the rushes one day [...] "that I couldn't get Grace Kelly". Director Joe Mankiewicz later called Simmons [...] "the dream ... a fantastically talented and enormously underestimated girl. In terms of talent, Jean Simmons is so many heads and shoulders above most of her contemporaries, one wonders why she didn't become the great star she could have been." ...|$|R
40|$|Adequacy of {{antimicrobial}} {{therapy in}} urinary tract infections (UTI) Urinary tract infections {{are one of}} the most common reasons for antimicrobial prescriptions, however urine cultures are often <b>unavailable</b> and the <b>choice</b> of antibiotics is therefore empiric. The ideal antimicrobial agent must have specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics and an adequate spectrum of activity in order to obtain the potential eradication of the pathogen from the site of infection, minimizing the risk of recurrences and ensuring the best safety profile. There are several factors to be considered in the therapy choice: the type of infection, the increasing presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria showing resistance to most antibiotics and the problem of the bacterial internalization, that is a frequent cause of treatment failure and early recurrences. Prulifloxacin is a recent oral fluoroquinolone antibiotic approved in several European countries for the treatment of lower urinary tract infections and shows some interesting advantages in comparison with other antibiotics...|$|R
30|$|Those {{impairments}} {{are also}} related to the ownership of a driving licence, i.e. another factor influencing mode choice. Relatively frequent driving skill assessments in older age may result in losing a driving licence and driving ceasing. In addition, {{not being able to}} drive a car is more and more frequent with the increasing age of seniors. Driving cessation in return significantly influences individual’s lifestyle, especially because of its pressure to change well-established and previously functional behavioural pattern of a car driving [2]. Driving cessation (along with <b>unavailable</b> alternative mode <b>choices)</b> could be challenging since active lifestyle is mobility-demanding [3]. In the case {{of not being able to}} drive anymore, some seniors may turn to their relatives or other persons within their social network [18]. However, the social network may not have the capacity to cover all the trips. Furthermore, this issue has a gender dimension as fewer women own driving licenses in comparison to their male counterparts. The lack of transportation alternatives burdens older women more than older men [3].|$|R
40|$|The {{epidemiologic}} {{pattern of}} cancers {{in developing countries}} differs in many aspects from that of industrialized nations. Cancer natural history, microbiologic environment, patient's immune system, and drug availability may differ as well. Four of five new cases of cervical cancer and most of cervical cancer deaths occur in developing countries. Where chemoradiation and supportive care facilities are unavailable, it would be logical to consider an inexpensive effective drug. In locally advanced cases, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery should be considered the treatment of choice. For ovarian cancer, it may be reasonable to maintain a secure supply of platinum and/or taxanes. For endometrial cancer, platinum compounds are proved active chemotherapic single agents. Oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) may represent a good chance for treating an advanced or recurrent disease. For vulvar/vaginal cancer, the role of chemotherapy alone is currently considered limited, and it is mostly used as palliative treatment in advanced or recurrent cases. Whenever possible, standard western chemotherapic regimens should be applied in developing countries as well. When standard therapies are <b>unavailable,</b> drugs of <b>choice</b> should be easily accessible, inexpensive, and effective. The most commonly used drugs are cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and MPA. © 2006, Copyright the Authors...|$|R
50|$|While {{some of the}} {{collaborators}} were civilians, {{others were}} given choice of enlisting for paramilitary service beginning in September 1941 from the Soviet POW camps, due to ongoing close relations with the Ukrainian Hilfsverwaltung. In total, over 5,000 native Ukrainian soldiers of the Red Army signed up for training with the SS at a special Trawniki training camp, {{to assist with the}} Final Solution. Another 1,000 of them defected during field operations. Trawniki men took major part in the Nazi plan to exterminate European Jews during Operation Reinhard. They served at all extermination camps, and {{played an important role in}} the annihilation of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (see the Stroop Report) and the Białystok Ghetto Uprising among other ghetto insurgencies. Ukrainian natives were offered <b>choice</b> <b>unavailable</b> to Russian soldiers dying of starvation and exposure in the POW camps for the Red Army. The men who were dispatched to death camps and Jewish ghettos as guards were never fully trusted, and always overlooked by Volksdeutsche. Occasionally, along with the prisoners they were guarding, they would kill their commanders in the process of attempting to defect.|$|R
40|$|In this {{position}} paper, we provide a preliminary assessment of {{hardware and software}} solution stack choices available to developers of resource-oriented web services on commodity embedded devices. As {{part of an ongoing}} interdisciplinary research project on air and water quality in a major urban ecosystem, we are developing an information infrastructure amounting to a role-based hierarchy of individually addressable, interconnected resources, ranging from sensors, analyzers, and other monitoring devices to aggregators and publishers. This infrastructure follows the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern and integrates non-networked or non-RESTful monitoring devices through RESTful proxy resources running on low-cost, low-energy, possibly wireless, always-on embedded servers. Commodity wireless routers running a suitable embedded Linux distribution are a good choice for this purpose, and we have started to survey the landscape of supported solution stacks, including programming languages and RESTful frameworks: Not only were our preferred, familiar <b>choices</b> <b>unavailable</b> for medium-end routers, but we had to develop our own lightweight REST layer for lower-end routers. Given the growing popularity of embedded Linux devices, however, we argue that language designers and framework architects should support them to a much greater extent than they do now. In addition, as the demand for green computing grows, we argue that memory- and processor-efficient languages and frameworks become increasingly important...|$|R
5000|$|This {{piece is}} {{characteristic}} of existentialism, the prevalent school of thought among the era's literature. It also presents Camus' concept of absurdism, {{as well as many}} examples of human choices. The dilemmas faced by Daru are often seen as representing the dilemmas faced by Camus regarding the Algerian crisis and there are many similarities between the character of Daru and his creator Camus. Both are French Algerians exiled by the choices they have made.The main themes of [...] "The Guest" [...] are of choice and accountability. Camus emphasizes, characteristically of existentialist philosophy, that there is always a choice, that the only <b>choice</b> <b>unavailable</b> is not to choose. Daru chooses how he will handle Balducci and whether he will turn in the prisoner; the prisoner chooses whether to go to jail or to freedom. More important, however, is the theme of accountability. The essence of Camus's philosophy is that everyone is [...] "condemned" [...] to an eventual, inevitable death, and accepting this allows for a certain freedom; the prisoner, having achieved self-awareness when Daru gave him the choice to flee or go to jail, realizes the futility of fleeing from the inevitable punishment and goes willingly to jail, thus revolting against the inevitable by making the decision of his own accord and holding himself accountable for the murder.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Cranioplasty is a {{reconstructive}} procedure used {{to restore}} skull anatomy and repair skull defects. Optimal skull reconstruction {{is a challenge}} for neurosurgeons, and the strategy used to achieve the best result remains a topic of debate, especially in pediatric patients for whom the continuing skull growth makes the choice of material more difficult. When the native bone flap, which is universally accepted as the preferred option in pediatric patients, is <b>unavailable,</b> the authors' <b>choice</b> of prosthetic material is a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) implant designed using a custom-made technique. In this paper the authors present {{the results of their}} clinical series of 12 custom-made PMMA implants in pediatric patients. METHODS: A retrospective study of the patients who had undergone cranioplasty at Gaslini Children's Hospital between 2006 and 2013 was conducted. A total of 12 consecutive cranioplasties in 12 patients was reviewed, in which a patientspecific PMMA implant was manufactured using a virtual 3 D model and then transformed into a physical model using selective laser sintering or 3 D printing. All patients or parents were administered a questionnaire to assess how the patient/parent judged the aesthetic result. RESULTS: Patient age at craniectomy ranged from 5 months to 12. 5 years, {{with a mean age of}} 84. 33 months at cranioplasty. The mean extension of the custom-made plastic was 56. 83 cm 2. The mean time between craniectomy and cranioplasty was 9. 25 months. The mean follow-up duration was 55. 7 months. No major complications were recorded; 3 patients experienced minor/moderate complications (prosthesis dislocation, granuloma formation, and fluid collection). CONCLUSIONS: In this patient series, PMMA resulted in an extremely low complication rate and the custom-made technique was associated with an excellent grade of patient or parent satisfaction on long-term follow up...|$|R
