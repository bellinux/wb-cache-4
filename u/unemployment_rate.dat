40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{an issue}} that has been neglected in the vast array of literature focusing on the determination of and differences in regional <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates.</b> The issue of whether causal relationships exist between disaggregated <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> is considered. A multivariate vector autoregression model is estimated separately for <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> of ten states and nine regions. The resulting impulse response functions indicate that significant causal relationships exist between <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> of the states and regions analyzed. The results suggest that a mechanism allowing for causal relationships between disaggregate <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> should be incorporated into future analyses. ...|$|R

40|$|Using recent {{developments}} in time-series econometrics, this paper investigates the behavior of fertility over the business cycle. The sex-specific <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates,</b> the divorce rate and the fertility rate are shown to be governed by stochastic trends. Furthermore, fertility is determined to be co-integrated with the divorce and <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates.</b> In the bivariate vector-autoregressions between fertility and unemployment, {{an increase in the}} female or male <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> generate a decrease in fertility, which confirms the findings of previous time-series research concerning the procyclical behavior of fertility. However, when the models include the divorce rate and the proportion of young marriages as additional regressors, shocks to the <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> bring about an increase in fertility, implying the countercyclicality of fertility. ...|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} noted, though, that in {{contrast}} to the United States and Canada, where male rates are higher than female <b>rates,</b> female <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> are higher than male rates in both the EU and the Eurozone; this seems particularly the case in Southern Europe. In the latest data release from Eurostat, female <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> were higher than male <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> in ten countries: Austria, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain. 1 Though there is clearly a tendency towards convergence of youth <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> by gender between 2012 and 2015, southern European countries typically have female youth <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> that are significantly higher than their male equivalents, with Greece being the most extreme case. The ratio has narrowed {{since the beginning of the}} recession, but it still exceeds those in our comparison countries. The large number of females among the unemployed may have conditioned the social and political response.|$|R

40|$|In the study, the {{relationship}} between <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> of regions of Turkey and regions’ share in trade volume are analyzed by taking into account annual data of 26 regions that are defined as NUTS 2 by Turkish Statistical Institute {{for the period of}} 2004 - 2009. The share of regions in trade volume denotes rate of trade volumes of the cities included by the region in Turkey’s total trade volume. After the necessary tests are applicated to satisfy assumptions, fixed effect panel data and generalized method of moments are used for consistent and efficient estimation. In conclusion, in determining <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> of the regions, positive correlation is found between lag of <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> and related periods’ <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates.</b> Meanwhile, when shares of the regions in trade volume increase, <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> decrease.
