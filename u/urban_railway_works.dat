30|$|With the {{development}} of <b>urban</b> <b>railway</b> transportation, the metro and lower floor light rail vehicles {{have been widely used}} in many cities. Whereas, compared with the main line <b>railway</b> vehicles, the <b>urban</b> <b>railway</b> vehicles meet more challenges because of the limitation of circumstance [1, 2, 3], which means that the <b>urban</b> <b>railway</b> vehicles may encounter a large number of curved tracks in daily operations, especially tight curves. Therefore, <b>urban</b> <b>railway</b> vehicles require a good steering capability to negotiate the curve with small radius. However, according to the previous operation experience of <b>urban</b> <b>railway</b> vehicles, the conventional wheelset cannot provide sufficient self-steering capability to negotiate the sharp curve, which may leads to severe wheel/rail wear and noise [2, 3, 4].|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An {{effective}} traffic access system of <b>urban</b> <b>railway</b> will greatly increase {{the accessibility of}} transportation system. This paper analyzes the distribution between the access modes choice and the access distance and access time by a revealed preference survey for the ingress and egress of <b>urban</b> <b>railway</b> in Beijing. Then a joined nested mode choice logit model is sets up using the survey data. Three factors of access time, access cost and access distance on the traffic access mode choices of <b>urban</b> <b>railway</b> are analyzed. It is confirmed to be effective based on the combined estimated methodology by the comparison between the joined model and the ML model. The elasticity analysis of the model’s variables is conducted to analyze to what extent each variable influences the access mode choice of travelers. The conclusions provide an analytical tool for <b>urban</b> <b>railway</b> planning and construction, also advices on policy application. [Researcher. 2009; 1 (5) : 52 - 57].
