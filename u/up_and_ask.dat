500|$|Stan's new dog Sparky {{follows the}} boys {{to the bus stop}} one morning. Stan {{believes}} Sparky to be the toughest dog in South Park; but, when Sparky suddenly jumps on top of another male dog and begins humping him energetically, Cartman declares that Sparky is homosexual. At football practice for the school's team, the South Park Cows, Stan's Uncle Jimbo and his friend Ned show <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> Coach Chef whether the boys can beat the betting spread of 70 points for the Cows' game against the Middle Park Cowboys. Impressed by a play from Stan, who is the quarterback and star of the team, Jimbo and Ned go to the bookmaker, where Jimbo bets $500 on the Cows. As a result, everyone else bets all their money on the team, and they threaten Jimbo if the Cows lose. Intimidated, Jimbo and Ned seek a back-up plan and learn that John Stamos' brother Richard will be singing [...] "Lovin' You" [...] at half-time. Consequently, they plan to detonate the mascot for Middle Park, by placing a bomb to explode when Richard Stamos sings the high F note in the song.|$|E
2500|$|After {{leaving her}} job as a {{reporter}} at the UPI, Thomas became more likely to air her personal, negative views. In a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she quipped, [...] "I censored myself for 50 years when I was a reporter. Now I wake <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> myself, 'Who do I hate today?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 1, 2010, Jackson, {{after giving}} it {{tremendous}} thought and consulting with his doctors over health concerns, {{announced that he}} would return to coach the Lakers for the 2010–11 season. On August 2, 2010, Jackson signed a new contract with the Lakers to return for what he mentioned was [...] "his last stand", meaning the 2010–11 season would be his last. In January 2011, he reiterated that it would be his final season, explaining that in the past there was the possibility that maybe he would reconsider. [...] "This year, there's no maybe", said Jackson. He retired after the Lakers were swept out of the playoffs in the conference semifinals by that season's eventual NBA champions, the Dallas Mavericks, meaning that he would not get a fourth three-peat (after previously achieving that feat in 1993, 1998 and 2002). In his final news conference that season, he noted {{that he did not have}} much of a relationship with Jerry or Jim Buss, and said, [...] "When I leave here, I don't anticipate Lakers management will call me <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> my advice." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{leaving the}} seminary, Fernandes moved to Bombay in 1949 {{in search of}} a job. His life was tough in Bombay, and he had to sleep on the streets, until he got a job as a {{proofreader}} for a newspaper. He relates to the beginning of his career by saying, [...] "When I came to Bombay, I used to sleep on the benches of Chowpatty Sands. In {{the middle of the night}} policemen used to come and wake me <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> me to move on." [...] He came into contact with veteran union leader Placid D'Mello, and the socialist Rammanohar Lohia, who were the greatest influences on his life. Later, he joined the socialist trade union movement. He rose to prominence as a trade unionist and fought for the rights of labourers in small scale service industries such as hotels and restaurants. Emerging as a key figure in the Bombay labour movement in the early 1950s, Fernandes was a central figure in the unionisation of sections of Bombay labour in the 1950s. As a labour organiser, he served many prison terms when his workforce engaged in fights with company goons. He served as a member of the Bombay Municipal Corporation from 1961 to 1968. He won in the civic election in 1961 and, until 1968, continuously raised the problems of the exploited workers in the representative body of the metropolis.|$|E

60|$|The {{next day}} George was setting {{out on a}} visit to Grant when a man rode <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> for the team.|$|R
60|$|So I gave it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> {{him about}} himself. He {{said he was}} a Mezop, and that his name was Ja.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked back}} to the place, and entered it. Back of the counter stood a young who came <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> what was wished.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't use {{black or}} white," [...] said the girl, {{deliberately}} {{getting off the}} barrel. [...] "Guess I'll go <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> Miss Huckins if she has any red." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She doesn't, she can't!' cried Ellen vehemently; 'I {{know she}} doesn't, {{or she could}} never go about as she does. I'll call her <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> her, to satisfy you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{at any of}} the {{diplomatic}} receptions, I suppose," [...] he said, seeing that I was in earnest. [...] "He is rather a pal of Freddy's. Why don't you ring <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> him?" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{could not}} help it; I {{believed}} him. My own judgment seemed suddenly to rise <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> me why I should leave the solid deck of the steamer for that perilous little boat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank ye, Kelly, for the compliment, and {{especially}} for the good company. But let me hear how on earth you ever got face enough to go <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> Anty Lynch to marry you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are the stairs, then," [...] said Tunstall, coolly; [...] "go <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> Mrs. Marget of our master just now, and {{see what}} sort of a face he will wear under his hood." ...|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> me how I had got on with Dingaan, {{not being}} sorry, as I think, of {{an excuse to}} pause in his {{clerical}} labours.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, she has {{discovered}} that. She knows {{you have been}} hunting her <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>asking</b> questions about her. She is very much tickled by it. That's rather annoying." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Pasmer read it, {{not only}} without indignation, but {{apparently}} without displeasure. But, she understood perfectly what the trouble was, {{when she looked}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked,</b> cheerfully, [...] "Well?" ...|$|R
