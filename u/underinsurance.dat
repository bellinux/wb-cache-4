50|$|<b>Underinsurance</b> is {{the state}} of an {{individual}} having some form of health insurance that does not offer complete financial protection. This results in the underinsured individual to therefore lack the ability to cover out-of-pocket healthcare expenses.There is not yet one clear definition that has been established to include all of the domains that must be addressed. There are three domains that are included when considering <b>underinsurance</b> in healthcare. They include; (1) the economic characteristics of health insurance, (2) the benefits that are or are not covered, and (3) actual access to health services and resources. All of these aspects must be considered when defining, measuring, and identifying instances of <b>underinsurance.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{economic}} {{definition of}} <b>underinsurance</b> is a person’s actual {{ability to pay}} for their recommended health care and services. This includes the cost of the insurance premiums, co-payments, and deductibles. An economic definition of <b>underinsurance</b> specifically defines a certain monetary limit above which the expenses of health care coverage become a significant financial burden, and interfere with access to care. This definition of <b>underinsurance</b> is utilized and identified when an individuals' out-of-pocket expenses for necessary medical care are above a specified percent of that individual’s income, within a given time frame. This definition is also used when a person chooses to delay, or not receive necessary health care services solely because of the out-of-pocket costs associated with the services.|$|E
50|$|Condition {{of average}} (also called <b>underinsurance</b> in the U.S., or {{principal}} of average, subject to average, or pro rata condition of average in Commonwealth countries) is the insurance term used when calculating a payout against a claim where the policy undervalues the sum insured. In {{the event of}} partial loss, the amount paid against a claim {{will be in the}} same proportion as the value of the <b>underinsurance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Structural {{definitions}} of insurance, generally consider both {{the type of}} benefits that are offered by the healthcare insurance program, {{as well as the}} number and range of providers whose services are covered under the identified plan. A structural approach to defining <b>underinsurance</b> uses a benchmark benefits package as a basis of comparison. Structural <b>underinsurance</b> is utilized when at least one benefit in the benchmark package is not covered by the individual’s health insurance plan.|$|E

50|$|Children with Special Healthcare Needs (CSHCN) {{have been}} the most highly {{research}} population that experiences the effects of <b>underinsurance.</b> CSHCN have been routinely been defined as those who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally. All children who have been identified as CSHCN must be considered and taken into account when research is being conducted to further identify who is at risk for experiencing <b>underinsurance.</b>|$|E

50|$|Attitudinal {{definitions}} {{are derived}} from the consumers' perceptions, (as opposed to factual monetary limits) {{as well as their}} satisfaction in regards to health care. This definition leaves more opportunities for individual interpretation as compared to that of the economical and structural <b>underinsurance</b> definitions. The attitudinal <b>underinsurance</b> definition is recognized when; (1) at least one health benefit that the individual would prefer to receive is not covered by insurance, (2) when {{there is at least one}} symptom that the person believed required treatment for which insurance coverage treatment was not provided, or (3) when a person is dissatisfied with their insurance plan. Because there adequate room for personal interpretation in this definition, surveys that are conducted using this definition often are not always as well accepted when compared to surveys that are conducted using the structural and economical definitions.|$|E
5000|$|... where Payout is {{the amount}} paid out by the policy, Claim {{is the amount}} claimed against the policy after a loss, Sum Insured is the maximum amount to be paid out by the policy, and Current Value is the value the policy should be insured for. <b>Underinsurance</b> occurs when Sum Insured is less than Current Value.|$|E
50|$|Sum Insured is {{the maximum}} amount that can be paid out and is only paid out in cases of total {{destruction}}. Where partial destruction occurs (a more common occurrence than total destruction), Payout is pro rata {{in line with the}} <b>underinsurance.</b> This is due to insurance companies basing the premiums on their risk of losing the full Sum Insured against total destruction events.|$|E
5000|$|The term “uninsured” {{is often}} better known {{and more often}} discussed. This is {{because it has a}} clear {{definition}} of an individual not possessing health insurance coverage. This clearly defined term allows for accurate measurements of the number of uninsured people, and more reliable research results. However, an individual being underinsured, or experiencing <b>underinsurance</b> is much more difficult to research and measure. This is because there is not one simple clear-cut definition of <b>underinsurance.</b> Rather there are three different types of definitions that are most commonly discussed; economical, attitudinal and structural. This difficulty and inconsistency in defining the term has led to a lack of research and knowledge of the topic. [...] It has been established that individuals who are categorized as underinsured, are at high financial risk, and face barriers in the level of access to care. This difficulty in access to care is similar to those who are completely uninsured.|$|E

5000|$|When {{concerned}} with {{medical care and}} services, {{it has been shown}} that people who are experiencing the repercussions of <b>underinsurance</b> behave a lot like those individuals who are uninsured. Individuals often don’t visit the doctor, don’t fill prescriptions, and don’t undergo preventive checkups and lab tests. [...] Even when they go without preventive care and necessary prescriptions, many of the undersinsured are still unable to cover all their medical expenses. Some of the most common medical expenses that underinsured people are not able to cover include rising health care premiums, deductibles, and copayments, as well as limits on coverage for various services or other limits and excluded services that can increase out-of-pocket expenses.|$|E
50|$|When {{contents}} insurance {{states that}} new-for-old applies, this {{increases the likelihood}} of under insurance. For example, a quantity of items amongst the contents might have a low resale value but a high new-for-old value. This can happen if quantities of used or second-hand goods are collected; their resale value may be low, but to replace as-new would require a high payout against the policy. In such a case, if the policy is subject to average, any claim will be reduced by the value of the <b>underinsurance.</b> Crucially, this occurs with partial loss of the contents, even where the low-resale value contents are completely undamaged and may even be stored separately, as in an undamaged outhouse covered as part of the policy.|$|E
5000|$|Coverage gaps {{also occur}} among the insured population. Johns Hopkins University {{professor}} Vicente Navarro stated in 2003, [...] "the problem {{does not end}} here, with the uninsured. An even larger problem is the underinsured" [...] and [...] "The most credible estimate {{of the number of}} people in the United States who have died because of lack of medical care was provided by a study carried out by Harvard Medical School Professors Himmelstein and Woolhandler. They concluded that almost 100,000 people died in the U.S. yearly because of lack of needed care." [...] Another study by the Commonwealth Fund published in Health Affairs estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. The study defined <b>underinsurance</b> as characterized by at least one of the following conditions: annual out-of-pocket medical expenses totaling 10% or more of income, or 5% or more among adults with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level; or health plan deductibles equaling or exceeding 5% of income. The underinsured were significantly more likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care, report financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that <b>underinsurance</b> disproportionately affects those with lower incomes - 73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level. Another study focusing on the effect of being uninsured found that individuals with private insurance were less likely to be diagnosed with late-stage cancer than either the uninsured or Medicaid beneficiaries. A study examining the effects of health insurance cost-sharing more generally found that chronically ill patients with higher co-payments sought less care for both minor and serious symptoms while no effect on self-reported health status was observed. The authors concluded that the effect of cost sharing should be carefully monitored.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the number}} of {{employers}} who offer health insurance has declined and costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising: from 2001 to 2007, premiums for family coverage increased 78%, while wages rose 19% and prices rose 17%, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the impact of}} moral hazard for estimating relative rates of <b>underinsurance</b> and to present an adjustment method to correct for this source of bias. Individuals or households are often classified as underinsured if out-of-pocket spending on medical care relative to income exceeds some threshold. We show that, without adjustment, this common threshold measure of <b>underinsurance</b> will underestimate the number {{with low levels of}} insurance coverage due to moral hazard. We propose an adjustment method and apply it to the specific case of estimating the difference in rates of <b>underinsurance</b> among small- versus large-firm workers with full-year, employer-sponsored insurance. Using data from the 2005 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we find that after applying the adjustment, the <b>underinsurance</b> rate of small-firm households increases by approximately 20 % with the adjustment for moral hazard and the difference in <b>underinsurance</b> rates between large firm and small firm households widens substantially. Adjusting for moral hazard makes a sizeable difference in the estimated prevalence of <b>underinsurance</b> using a threshold measure. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{estimate}} the extent of <b>underinsurance</b> among Malaysian families in 2012. <b>Underinsurance</b> is quantified by {{the extent to which}} the citizens in a country are inadequately covered by the life insurance protection. To measure <b>underinsurance,</b> we use the concept of the life insurance protection gap as proposed by Swiss Re (2004). The mortality protection gap is the difference between the resources needed and the resources available. The resources needed refer to the resources the surviving dependents require for income replacement, debt repayment and other major expenses. The resources available refer to those resources actually available to the dependents from financial assets, social security and life insurance coverage. The data collected are simulated using the Monte Carlo simulation process.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the adequacy of}} life insurance among married American couples approaching retirement. It improves upon previous work in two ways. First, {{it is based on}} recent, high quality data (the 1992 Health and Retirement Survey with matched Social Security earnings histories). Second, it employs new financial planning software to evaluate the life insurance needs of each household. This software embodies an elaborate life- cycle planning model that accounts for a broad array of demographic, economic, and financial characteristics. We find that a sizable minority of couples in the HRS sample are significantly underinsured. Almost one third of wives and more than 10 percent of husbands would have suffered living standard reductions of 20 percent or more had their spouses died in 1992. <b>Underinsurance</b> tends to be more common among low income households, couples with asymmetric earnings, younger households, couples with dependent children, and non-whites. In general, households with greater vulnerabilities do not appear to compensate adequately for these vulnerabilities through greater life insurance holdings. Among some groups, the frequency of <b>underinsurance</b> exceeds two-thirds, and the frequency of severe <b>underinsurance</b> (a reduction in living standard of 40 percent or greater) exceeds one-quarter. ...|$|E
40|$|Relative {{consumption}} {{has been}} found to be crucial in many areas, such as asset pricing, the design of taxation, and economic growth. This article extends this line of research to the individual's insurance decision. We first define "keeping up with the Joneses" in the purchase of insurance and find that jealousy does not necessarily give rise to "keeping up with the Joneses. " We also identify several sufficient conditions that cause the optimal coverage in the private market to be less than the social optimum (equilibrium <b>underinsurance).</b> Jealousy is found to be neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for equilibrium <b>underinsurance.</b> We further show that a social welfare maximizing government could adopt a tax system to correct for the consumption externality and make individuals better off.

40|$|We {{explore the}} demand for {{insurance}} for particular cases where public sentiment assumes <b>underinsurance</b> is prevalent. Our purpose is to theoretically and empirically investigate {{the extent to which}} <b>underinsurance</b> represents rational behavior on the part of individuals. In this proposal, we briefly outline our theory, which is based upon a simple binomial model of {{the demand for}} insurance. Our theory enables us to derive an insurance demand equation and generate comparative statics which we plan to empirically test in time for the upcoming meeting of the American Risk and Insurance Association. Media narratives concerning natural catastrophes and health care costs frequently identify the lack or paucity of insurance coverage for such events. These gaps in insurance coverage are especially troubling given the public policy implications which demand catastrophe relief from state and federal governments. Three specific loss exposures which generate significant interest are flood insurance (especially following the 2005 hurricane season), earthquake insurance and health insurance.

40|$|This article explores some of {{the issues}} raised by the new {{evidence}} of <b>underinsurance.</b> Part I explores the initial theoretical question: why do people buy life insurance? Put differently, what function does life insurance serve? Part II provides some background on the life insurance market as it currently exists. Thus, Part II summarizes the major types of life insurance that are currently offered and summarizes the main elements of the current regulatory regime for life insurance companies. Part III then provides support for the claim that households tend to drastically underconsume life insurance. Section A of that Part summarizes the existing empirical evidence, which finds substantial and widespread <b>underinsurance.</b> As I will point out, however, the scholars conducting those studies take pains to avoid reaching any normative conclusions based on their findings. In other words, although they do find substantial and widespread <b>underinsurance,</b> (almost paradoxically) they assert that such a finding does not imply that too little insurance is being bought. There is no paradox, however. The economists are simply demonstrating their awareness of the theoretical difficulty of specifying the 2 ̆ 2 right 2 ̆ 2 amount of life insurance coverage. Although it is impossible to answer that question definitively, in section B, this article favors a baseline that defines adequacy as that amount of life insurance necessary to maintain the survivors 2 ̆ 7 standard of living, which happens to be the baseline that the researchers used in their empirical studies. That standard-of-living baseline will be controversial in some circles and, after a period of public debate, may be ultimately rejected. That outcome would be perfectly acceptable, so long as the debate takes place and households are forced to think seriously about what the right amount of life insurance is for their needs. Indeed, the main objective {{of this article is to}} start such a discussion. However, this article seeks to push the debate one step beyond the adequacy question. Therefore, Part IV reviews a number of theoretical reasons why the economists 2 ̆ 7 empirical evidence should be given a normative slant; that is, why the evidence should be interpreted as indicating a true <b>underinsurance</b> problem and why, therefore, further government intervention may indeed be appropriate. These 2 ̆ 2 reasons to be worried 2 ̆ 2 include the same sort of externality and behavioral rationales that have been offered for government intervention in other contexts...|$|E

40|$|While {{there is}} still much {{disagreement}} on the causes underlying recent emerging markets' crises, one factor that most observers have agreed upon is that contracting dollar' (foreign currency) denominated external debt as opposed to domestic currency debt created balance sheet mismatches that led to bankruptcies and dislocations that amplified downturns. Much of the analysis of the currency-balance sheet channel' hinges on the assumption that companies contract dollar denominated debt. Yet there has been little systematic inquiry into why companies must or choose to take on dollar debt. In this paper we cast the problem as one of microeconomic <b>underinsurance</b> with respect to country-wide aggregate shocks. Denominating external debt in domestic currency is equivalent to contracting the same amount of dollar-debt, complemented with insurance against shocks that depreciate the equilibrium exchange rate. The presence of country-level international financial constraints justify the purchase of such insurance even if all agents are risk neutral. However, if domestic financial constraints also exist, domestics will undervalue the social contribution of contracting insurance against country-wide shocks. Foreign lenders will reinforce the <b>underinsurance</b> problem by reducing their participation in domestic financial markets. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{focus on the}} uninsured from national and state levels. There are also many Americans who have health insurance but are unable to afford their recommended care and are considered underinsured. This {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of under-insurance among patients seen in primary care clinics. Methods: Patients in 37 primary care practices in 3 practice-based research networks completed a survey to elicit the prevalence of <b>underinsurance</b> among those who had insurance for a full 12 months, including private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. Being underinsured was based on patients report-ing the delay or omission of recommended care because of their inability to afford it. Results: Of those with insurance for a full year, 36. 3 % were underinsured. Of those who were under-insured, 50. 2 % felt that their health suffered because they could not afford recommended care, a rate similar among those who were uninsured. Conclusions: When evaluating <b>underinsurance</b> in primary care offices, using an experiential defini-tion based on self-reports of patients about their inability to pay for recommended health care despite having insurance, the prevalence is quite high. It is important for the primary care physician to under-stand that a substantial percentage of their patients may not follow through with their recommendation...|$|E
