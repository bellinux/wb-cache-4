40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{implementation}} of a highly efficient <b>universal</b> <b>index</b> of textual documents. Universal stands {{for an opportunity to}} configure structures of index records and methods of the index data processing (without recompiling an application). Furthermore, it means that the index library can be used even for other purposes, for example to implement a thesaurus, to represent bibliographic relationships or even for generic representation of a specific class of functions in other areas than documentographic systems. The index is implemented using the dynamic inverted file which can be efficiently updated without need of the data structure rebuilding. Specific issue is on-line index compression and failure recovery via the transactional log. It is shown that the amortized complexity of the data structure is linear. This fact is afterwards experimentally verified. Other experiments address the compression methods and the impact of the data structure parameters on its efficiency.

40|$|The time {{course of}} the center of {{pressure}} (CoP) during human quiet standing, corresponding to body sway, is a stochastic process, influenced by a variety of features of the underlying neuro-musculo-skeletal system, such as postural stability and flexibility. Due to complexity of the process, sway patterns have been characterized in an empirical way by a number of indices, such as sway size and mean sway velocity. Here, we describe a statistical approach with the aim of estimating "universal" indices, namely parameters that are independent of individual body characteristics and thus are not "hidden" by the presence of individual, daily, and circadian variations of sway; in this manner it is possible to characterize the common aspects of sway dynamics across healthy young adults, in the assumption that they might reflect underlying neural control during quiet standing. Such <b>universal</b> <b>indices</b> are identified by analyzing intra and inter-subject variability of various indices, after sorting out individual-specific indices that contribute to individual discriminations. It is shown that the <b>universal</b> <b>indices</b> characterize mainly slow components of sway, such as scaling exponents of power-law behavior at a low-frequency regime. On the other hand, most of the individual-specific indices contributing to the individual discriminations exhibit significant correlation with body parameters, and they can be associated with fast oscillatory components of sway. These results are consistent with a mechanistic hypothesis claiming that the slow and the fast components of sway are associated, respectively, with neural control and biomechanics, supporting our assumption that the universal characteristics of postural sway might represent neural control strategies during quiet standing...|$|R

In [5] {{we showed}} nonvaninishing of the <b>universal</b> <b>index</b> {{elements}} in the K-theory of the maximal C ∗-algebras of the fundamental groups of enlargeable spin manifolds.
