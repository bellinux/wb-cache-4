Method: The study employed a non-blinded randomised controlled trial to test the effect of IJS on early-phase substance use and sanctioning rates. All participants accepted onto the Parramatta Drug Court program between March 2010 and March 2011 were randomly allocated into either an IJS or supervision as usual (SAU) condition. The IJS group had phase 1 of their program extended from three to four months and appeared before the judge two times per week during phase 1. The SAU group appeared once per week for three months during phase 1. Results: Participants in the IJS group were significantly less likely to return positive <b>urinalysis</b> <b>tests</b> and had a significantly greater number of episodes of abstinence than participants in the SAU group.

Aim: early diagnosis of nephrosclerosis formation in children up to 3 years of age with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis without anatomical congenital urinary tract defects {{in the period of}} its complete remission. Materials and methods. We have examined 65 children with acute pyelonephritis in the period of complete remission, without any anatomic developmental urinary tract defects. Children underwent general clinical examination, evaluation of the markers of functional state of the tubular epithelium and glomerular part of the nephrons, oxyproline in the urine, urinalysis. Results. <b>Urinalysis</b> <b>tests</b> revealed higher frequency of excretion of all indicators in the urine of children in the main group in comparison with healthy children. The creatinine level in the urine of patients with pyelonephritis was lower in 21. 5 % of the examinees as compared to 2. 5 % of healthy children. 9. 2 % of the children with pyelonephritis had elevated levels of oxyproline, which is the marker of connective tissue dysfunction in the renal parenchyma. Glycosaminoglycan secretion analysis reveals that in children of all age groups with pyelonephritis, it was not significantly higher. Conclusions.

OBJETIVOS: Explorar a microbiologia e a freqüência de infecção urinária por cocos em adultos sintomáticos, relacionando-as com o resultado de nitrito urinário, para traçar o perfil epidemiológico desses pacientes. MATERIAL E MÉTODO: Um estudo retrospectivo foi conduzido na Secretaria de Saúde do município de Maringá-PR, no período de abril de 2004 a março de 2005.

RESULTS: Urine specimens from 3, 426 patients were collected and examined. A total of 448 (13. 1 %) samples had positive culture results.

40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: A anticoagulação com varfarina é usada na hipercoagubilidade e como profilaxia para o tromboembolismo. O tempo e atividade de protrombina e a relação normatizada internacional (TAP/RNI) são os exames padrões para acompanhamento laboratorial da taxa de anticoagulação. A hemorragia é uma complicação desta terapia. Dessa forma, especula-se a possibilidade de diagnosticar casos em que haja excesso de anticoagulação, por meio da análise da hematúria no exame dos elementos anormais e sedimentoscopia da urina (EAS) e a associação com TAP/RNI. OBJETIVO: Analisar a existência de correlação entre hematúria no EAS e TAP /RNI elevados, nos usuários do anticoagulante varfarina. METODOLOGIA: Estudo descritivo, analítico, primário, quantitativo e transversal. Incluíram-se 128 pacientes, sendo 63 tratados com varfarina, formando um grupo anticoagulado (GAC) e 65 que não faziam uso de anticoagulantes, grupo não anticoagulado (GNAC). Colheram-se 152 amostras de sangue e urina; das quais 24 pacientes do GAC contribuíram duas vezes para exames TAP/RNI e EAS, em dois momentos distintos. Todos os participantes do GNAC também se submeteram aos exames TAP/RNI e EAS. Excluíram-se pacientes com suspeita clínica de condições que causassem hematúria. Analisaram-se os dados sociodemográficos e fez-se a mensuração e a análise das variáveis numéricas hematúria e de outros parâmetros do EAS e RNI. Calculou-se a prevalência e a correlação entre hematúria e níveis de TAP/RNI. Os dados oriundos de exames, consultas médicas e dos prontuários dos pacientes recrutados na sala de coleta do Laboratório Clinico do HC-UFG, foram avaliados estatisticamente, com ênfase na correlação de Spearman para hematúria e TAP/RNI (IC 95 %; p< 0, 05). O projeto foi aprovado pelo Comitê de Ética e Pesquisa Humana do HC-UFG sob o nº 016 / 2012. RESULTADOS: A quantidade de varfarina semanal variou de 10 a 65 mg. Considerando-se o valor de RNI entre 2 e 3, 9, como valor aceitável para adequada anticoagulação, 59, 77 % estavam adequadamente anticoagulados, 35 % insuficientemente e, com efeito anticoagulante excessivo, 5, 75 %. A prevalência de hematúria no GAC foi de 26, 44 % (IC 95 % 17, 98 – 36, 43) e no GNAC, foi de 29, 23 % (IC 95 % 19, 16 – 41, 11). O coeficiente de correlação entre hematúria e RNI foi de 0, 012 (p= 0, 887). CONCLUSÕES: A maioria dos pacientes (59, 7 %) tinha a RNI na faixa terapêutica preconizada para anticoagulação. Não houve correlação entre hematúria ao exame EAS e os níveis de anticoagulação medidos pela RNI. INTRODUCTION: Anticoagulation with {{warfarin}} {{is used in}} {{the presence}} of hypercoagulability and as prophylaxis for thromboembolism. Prothrombin time and activity and the international normalized ratio (PTA/INR) are the standard tests for laboratory follow up of the anticoagulation rate. Hemorrhage is one complication of this therapy. Therefore, one speculates on the possibility of diagnosing cases in which there is excess anticoagulation, by means of the analysis of hematuria in urinalysis and the association with PTA/INR. OBJECTIVE: Analyze the existence of a correlation between hematuria in urinalysis and high PTA/INR, among users of warfarin. METHODOLOGY: This is a descriptive, analytical, primary, quantitative and cross-sectional investigation. The study included 128 patients, 63 of whom were being treated with warfarin, and formed the group of anticoagulated patients (ACG). The remaining 65 patients who were not using anticoagulants formed the non anticoagulated group (NACG). For this study, 152 blood and urine samples were collected; 24 patients of the ACG contributed twice for the PTA/INR and urinalysis, at two different times. All the participants of the NACG also had the PTA/INR and <b>urinalysis</b> <b>tests</b> done. Patients with a clinical suspicion of conditions that might cause hematuria were excluded. The social and demographic data of these individuals were analyzed and the numerical variables of hematuria and of other urinalysis and INR parameters were measured and analyzed. The prevalence and the correlation between hematuria and PTA/INR levels were calculated. Data from the tests, medical appointments and the records of patients recruited in the collection room of the Clinical Laboratory of the HC-UFG were evaluated statistically, and emphasis was placed on the Spearman's correlation for hematuria and PTA/INR (IC 95 %; p< 0. 05). The study was approved by the Committee on Ethics and Human Research of the HC-UFG, protocol No. 016 / 2012. RESULTS: The amount of warfarin given on a weekly basis ranged from 10 to 65 mg. If one considers the INR between 2 and 3. 9 acceptable for adequate anticoagulation, 59. 77 % of the individuals were adequately anticoagulated, 35 % were insufficiently anticoagulated and 5. 75 % were excessively anticoagulated. The prevalence of hematuria among the ACG members was 26. 44 % (CI 95 % 17. 98 – 36. 43) and among NACG members, 29. 23 % (CI 95 % 19. 16 – 41. 11). The correlation coefficient between hematuria and INR was 0. 012 (p= 0. 887). CONCLUSIONS: The most of the patients (59. 7 %) were within the recommended therapeutic range for controlling patients. There was no correlation between hematuria as measured by urinalysis and anticoagulation levels measured by the INR...|$|E
