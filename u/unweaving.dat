In the poem, one line reads [...] "Alas! For this gray shadow, once a man." [...] VanWinkle argues that in The X-Files episode, this line is paralleled by Alfred Fellig's tendency to see those about to die in a monochromatic vision. Furthermore, both the poem and the episode stress that death is not appealing because it is simply [...] "a means to an end". Rather, it is to be sought because it [...] "is the event that most fully unites us with other humans." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his role}} as {{professor}} for public understanding of science, Dawkins has been a critic of pseudoscience and alternative medicine. His 1998 book <b>Unweaving</b> the Rainbow considers John Keats's accusation that by explaining the rainbow, Isaac Newton diminished its beauty; Dawkins argues for the opposite conclusion. He suggests that deep space, the billions of years of life's evolution, and the microscopic workings of biology and heredity contain more beauty and wonder than do [...] "myths" [...] and [...] "pseudoscience". For John Diamond's posthumously published Snake Oil, a book devoted to debunking alternative medicine, Dawkins wrote a foreword in which he asserts that alternative medicine is harmful, if only because it distracts patients from more successful conventional treatments and gives people false hopes. Dawkins states that [...] "there is no alternative medicine. There is only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't work." [...] In his 2007 Channel 4 TV film The Enemies of Reason, Dawkins concluded that Britain is gripped by [...] "an epidemic of superstitious thinking".|$|E

[...] Sharon R. Yang, in her essay [...] "Weaving and <b>Unweaving</b> the Story," [...] writes that Mulder is using affluent literature to [...] "justify his passionate dedication to questing for knowledge in arcane areas scorned by mainstream intellectual authority". In addition, Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, argue that the episode functions as a fairy tale, and that its conclusion {{is an example of a}} happy ending; Exley bleeds red blood as he lays dying, granting the alien his wish to become human. In addition, the two mused that the meta nature of the episode is similar to the way fans of the series reacted to new episodes of The X-Files.|$|E

[...] In {{an examination of}} Fish's arguments, Hirsch attempts to demonstrate that [...] "not only was a restoration of New Critical methods unnecessary, but that Fish himself had not managed to rid himself of the shackles of New Critical theory." [...] Hirsch compares Fish's work to Penelope's loom in the Odyssey, stating, [...] "what one critic weaves by day, another unweaves by night." [...] "Nor," [...] he writes, [...] "does this weaving and <b>unweaving</b> constitute a dialectic, since no forward movement takes place."

6000|$|So {{said the}} wicked elf, {{as she looked}} into her own great eyes in the little square of mirror shaded by a misty {{asparagus}} bush; and to this end there were various braidings and adornings of the lustrous black hair, and coquettish earrings were mounted that hung glancing and twinkling just by the smooth outline of her glowing cheek,--and then Sally looked at herself in a friendly way of approbation, and nodded at the bright dimpled shadow {{with a look of}} secret understanding. The real Sally and the Sally of the looking-glass were on admirable terms with each other, and both of one mind about the plan of campaign against the common enemy. Sally thought of him as he stood kingly and triumphant on the deck of his vessel, his great black eyes flashing confident glances into hers, and she felt a rebellious rustle of all her plumage. [...] "No, sir," [...] she said to herself, [...] "you don't do it. You shall never find me among your slaves,"--"that you know of," [...] added a doubtful voice within her. [...] "Never to your knowledge," [...] she said, as she turned away. [...] "I wonder if he will come here this evening," [...] she said, as she began to work upon a pillow-case,--one of a set which Mrs. Kittridge had confided to her nimble fingers. The seam was long, straight, and monotonous, and Sally was restless and fidgety; her thread would catch in knots, and when she tried to loosen it, would break, and the needle had to be threaded over. Somehow the work was terribly irksome to her, and the house looked so still and dim and lonesome, and the tick-tock of the kitchen-clock was insufferable, and Sally let her work fall in her lap and looked out of the open window, far to the open ocean, where a fresh breeze was blowing toward her, and her eyes grew deep and dreamy following the gliding ship sails. Sally was getting romantic. Had she been reading novels? Novels! What can a pretty woman find in a novel equal to the romance that is all the while weaving and <b>unweaving</b> about her, and of which no human foresight can tell her the catastrophe? It is novels that give false views of life. Is there not an eternal novel, with all these false, cheating views, written in the breast of every beautiful and attractive girl whose witcheries make every man that comes near her talk like a fool? Like a sovereign princess, she never hears the truth, unless it be from the one manly man in a thousand, who understands both himself and her. From all the rest she hears only flatteries more or less ingenious, according to the ability of the framer. Compare, for instance, what Tom Brown says to little Seraphina at the party to-night, with what Tom Brown sober says to sober sister Maria about her to-morrow. Tom remembers that he was a fool last night, and knows what he thinks and always has thought to-day; but pretty Seraphina thinks he adores her, so that no matter what she does he will never see a flaw, she is sure of that,--poor little puss! She does not know that philosophic Tom looks at her as he does at a glass of champagne, or a dose of exhilarating gas, and calculates how much it will do for him to take of the stimulus without interfering with his serious and settled plans of life, which, of course, he doesn't mean to give up for her. The one-thousand-and-first man in creation is he that can feel the fascination but will not flatter, and that tries to tell to the little tyrant the rare word of truth that may save her; he is, as we say, the one-thousand-and-first. Well, as Sally sat with her great dark eyes dreamily following the ship, she mentally thought over all the compliments Moses had paid her, expressed or understood, and those of all her other admirers, who had built up a sort of cloud-world around her, so that her little feet never rested on the soil of reality. Sally was shrewd and keen, and had a native mother-wit in the discernment of spirits, that made her feel that somehow this was all false coin; but still she counted it over, and it looked so pretty and bright that she sighed to think it was not real.|$|E

This project will eliminate the weaving movements of I-694 at its interchange with U.S. Highway 10 (US 10) and MN 51 in Arden Hills. This interchange often creates one of the worst bottlenecks in the Twin Cities because drivers need to change at least one lane to continue either direction on I-694 between MN 51 (Snelling Avenue) and US 10. When the construction project is completed, the roadway of I-694 will include three thru-lanes in each direction from I-35W at New Brighton to US 10 at Arden Hills; four thru-lanes in each direction from US 10 in Arden Hills to Rice Street at Shoreview-Little Canada; and five thru-lanes in each direction from Rice Street to the I-694-I-35E interchange, compared with the current two to three lanes throughout the I-694 corridor.|$|R
