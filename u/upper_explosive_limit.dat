25|$|Like other hydrocarbons, {{gasoline}} {{burns in}} a limited range of its vapor phase and, coupled with its volatility, this makes leaks highly dangerous when sources of ignition are present. Gasoline has a lower explosive limit of 1.4% by volume and an <b>upper</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> of 7.6%. If the concentration is below 1.4%, the air-gasoline mixture is too lean and does not ignite. If the concentration is above 7.6%, the mixture is too rich and also does not ignite. However, gasoline vapor rapidly mixes and spreads with air, making unconstrained gasoline quickly flammable.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} small energy, often {{as little as}} 0.2–2 millijoules, is needed to ignite a flammable mixture of a fuel and air. For the common industrial hydrocarbon gases and solvents, the minimum ignition energy required for ignition of vapor-air mixture is lowest for the vapor concentration roughly in the middle between the lower explosive limit and the <b>upper</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limit,</b> and rapidly increases as the concentration deviates from this optimum to either side. Aerosols of flammable liquids may be ignited well below their flash point. Generally, liquid aerosols with particle sizes below 10 micrometers behave like vapors, particle sizes above 40 micrometers behave more like flammable dusts. Typical minimum flammable concentrations of aerosols lay between 15 and 50 g/m3. Similarly, presence of foam {{on the surface of}} a flammable liquid significantly increases ignitability. Aerosol of flammable dust can be ignited as well, resulting in a dust explosion; the lower explosive limit usually lies between 50 and 1000 g/m3; finer dusts tend to be more explosive and requiring less spark energy to set off. Simultaneous presence of flammable vapors and flammable dust can significantly decrease the ignition energy; a mere 1 vol.% of propane in air can reduce the required ignition energy of dust by 100 times. Higher than normal oxygen content in atmosphere also significantly lowers the ignition energy.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Upper</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> (UEL): Highest {{concentration}} (percentage) {{of a gas}} or a vapor in air {{capable of}} producing a flash of fire in presence of an ignition source (arc, flame, heat). Concentrations higher than UFL or UEL are [...] "too rich" [...] to burn. Operating above the UEL is usually avoided for safety because air leaking in can bring the mixture into combustibility range.|$|E
5000|$|Whether {{a mixture}} of air and gas is {{combustible}} depends on the air-to-fuel ratio. For each fuel, ignition occurs only within the explosive range (i.e. the Lower and <b>upper</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limits).</b> For example, for methane and gasoline vapor, the explosive range is 5-15% and 1.3-6.0% gas to air, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{air-fuel ratio}} determines whether a mixture is {{combustible}} at all, how much energy is being released, {{and how much}} unwanted pollutants are produced in the reaction. Typically a range of fuel to air ratios exists, outside of which ignition will not occur. These are known as the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{models to}} predict the upper/lower <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> of a mixture {{composed}} of hydrocarbon and inert carbon dioxide (CO 2) are proposed in this study. It is found theoretically that there are linear relations between the reciprocal of the upper/lower flammability limits and the reciprocal of the molar fraction of hydrocarbon in the hydrocarbon/inert gas mixture. These theoretical linear relations are examined by existing experimental results reported in the literature, which include the cases of methane. The experiments were performed in a 20 L closed explosion vessel. The mixtures were ignited by using spark permanent wire that placed at {{the centre of the}} vessel. Inthis study, the result shows the lower <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> (LEL) and <b>upper</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> (UEL) is from 5 vol% to 20 vol% of methane (CH 4) and have revealed that the addition of suppression agent as 5 vol% and 10 vol% carbon dioxide (CO 2) in methane extends the lower LEL and UEL initially 9 vol% to 18 vol% and 3 vol% to 16 vol%...|$|R

50|$|Below {{a certain}} value, the lower {{explosive}} limit (LEL), there is simply insufficient dust to support the combustion at the rate required for an explosion. A combustible concentration at or below 25% of the LEL is considered safe. Similarly, if the fuel/air ratio increases above the <b>upper</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> (UEL), there is insufficient oxidant to permit combustion to continue at the necessary rate.|$|E
50|$|The {{properties}} of some ignitable liquids make them dangerous fuels. Many ignitable liquids have high vapor pressures, low flash points and a relatively wide range between their <b>upper</b> and lower <b>explosive</b> <b>limit.</b> This allows ignitable liquids to ignite easily, and when mixed {{in a proper}} air-fuel ratio, readily explode. Many arsonists who use generous amounts of gasoline have been seriously burned or killed igniting their fire.|$|R
50|$|Explosive atmospheres have {{different}} chemical properties {{that affect the}} likelihood and severity of an explosion. Such properties include flame temperature, minimum ignition energy, <b>upper</b> and lower <b>explosive</b> <b>limits,</b> and molecular weight. Empirical testing is done to determine parameters such as the maximum experimental safe gap (MESG), minimum igniting current (MIC) ratio, explosion pressure and time to peak pressure, spontaneous ignition temperature, and maximum rate of pressure rise. Every substance has a differing combination of properties but {{it is found that}} they can be ranked into similar ranges, simplifying the selection of equipment for hazardous areas.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Using the {{experimental}} measurements of explosion limits of gas mixture containing H 2, CH 4 and CO at different {{composition of the}} gas mixture components, a BP Neural Network (BPNN) model is proposed to predict the minimum and maximum explosion limits of flammable gas mixture containing H 2, CH 4 and CO. In the present study, the volumetric content of the H 2, CO, CH 4 in the gas mixture are chosen as the input of the BPNN model, while the lower and <b>upper</b> concentration <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> as the output, respectively. The predications for lower and upper explosion limits are found to present good agreement with that observed in experiment. For example, the maximum relative error between the predictions of the lower and upper explosion limits and the experiment are only 3. 90 % and 3. 57 %, and the correlation coefficient for lower and upper explosion limits are respectively 0. 971 and 0. 981, which are much more accurate than the prediction by the Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) and various empirical correlations. For given volumetric content of the H 2, CO, CH 4 in the gas mixture, the explosion limits can be then determined by using the BPNN model with good accuracy...|$|R
50|$|A {{flooded engine}} is an {{internal}} combustion engine that has been fed an excessively rich air-fuel mixture that cannot be ignited. This {{is caused by the}} mixture exceeding the <b>upper</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> for the particular fuel. An engine in this condition will not start until the excessively rich mixture has been cleared. It is also possible for an engine to stall from a running state due to this condition.|$|E
5000|$|Flammable gases are not {{generally}} explosive under all conditions, and indeed, must be present within specific ranges {{in order to}} be explosive, or flammable. Additionally, oxygen must be present. [...] The flammability limits of gases are expressed in proportions to the other gases present. For example, for methane, the lower explosive limit (LEL) is 4.4% and the <b>upper</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> (UEL) is 17%. A positive pressure enclosure works by making sure that the methane present in the work area never approaches the 4.4% LEL.|$|E
50|$|Engine {{flooding}} was {{a common}} problem with carbureted cars, but newer fuel-injected ones are immune to the problem when operating within normal tolerances. Flooding usually occurs during starting, especially under cold conditions or because the accelerator has been pumped. It can also occur during hot starting; high temperatures may cause fuel in the carburetor float chamber to evaporate into the inlet manifold, causing the air/fuel mixture to exceed the <b>upper</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limit.</b> High temperature fuel may also result in a vapor lock, which is unrelated to flooding but has a similar symptom.|$|E
40|$|Mter a methane {{explosion}} in a coal mine a pre-determined crisis management procedure is instigated. As the process rapidly evolves the inevitable question arises -are personnel trapped underground, are they alive and {{can they be}} rescued without putting {{the lives of the}} rescue crew at risk? This is a very emotive question with many sub-questions such as; could anybody have survived, is there the potential for a secondary explosion and is there a 2 ̆ 7 window of opportunity 2 ̆ 7 before that secondary explosion occurs? To detemline if that window of opportunity exists two fundamental elements must be in place; a method of determining the atmosphere at key points in the mine and a method of predicting the course of change of that atmosphere with respect to time. The first element can be achieved if the tube bundle system is intact and drawing samples from known points, alternatively boreholes can be drilled from the surface. The second element can be realised by utilising a sequence of computer generated control charts which have a time axis, a percentage combustibles axis, the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> of the cUITent atmosphere and a prediction option which allows the user to look at the potential changes in the atmosphere over a set period of time. These control charts would be part of the mines on-going crisis management system rather than a tool to be used after an explosion had occurred...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are to {{determine}} the <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> of LPG/ air and to investigate the effect on <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> of LPG/ air when addition of hydrogen and dilution of nitrogen at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature.

The explosion pressure data is used to determine the <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> which flame propagation is considered occurred if explosion pressure greater than 0. 1 bar. From the explosion pressure data, the maximum explosion pressure is determined also. In this study, the result shows the <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> of LPG is from 2 vol% to 8 vol % of LPG. The addition of 2 and 8 vol% hydrogen in 7 vol% nitrogen reduce the lower explosive limit(LEL) initially 1 vol% to 0 vol% of LPG/air mixture. For safety aspect, the addition too much hydrogen seems very dangerous for application because the mixture is in very flammable condition.

These include: the representativeness of the sampling location(s), the rapidity of getting an underground sample analysed and the rate of change of the atmosphere being monitored.

This knowledge involves the properties of the gas itself, an awareness of where these accumulations are likely to occur, and facts on how methane mixes safely into the mine air. The other chapters in this handbook address the handling of methane under a variety of specific circumstances, such as at continuous miner faces or coal storage silos. This chapter addresses some broad concepts that serve as a foundation for the suggestions provided in other chapters. THE EXPLOSIBILITY OF METHANE GAS MIXTURES Methane entering a mine or tunnel often enters as a localized source at high concentration. Figure 1 - 1 depicts a cloud of methane being diluted into a moving air stream. In this illustration, methane enters the mine from a crack in the roof. As the methane emerges from the crack, it progressively mixes with the ventilation air and is diluted. In the event that this progressive dilution reduces the concentration from 100 % to 1 %, 2 as shown in Figure 1 - 1, the methane passes through a concentration range of 15 % to 5 %, known as the explosive range. In the explosive range, the mixture may be ignited.
