To date the m-FISH is the best setup for the assessment of the chromosome structural damage: it allows stable and instable aberrations to be detected all over the karyotype.

40|$|Background: Chemotherapy is the {{treatment}} of cancer with drugs, often used as either adjuvant or neoadjuvant or in conjunction with radiation and surgery. Unfortunately, majority of the drugs are toxic to normal tissues, the toxicity being resulting from multidrug protocol used to induce remissions and achieve tumor care. While it has been demonstrated for compounds like the 2 -deoxy-glucose (2 -DG) used as a modulator for radiation-induced damages, such studies were rarely reported for chemotherapeutic drugs. Objective: To study the effect of 2 -DG on radiation-and chemotherapeutic drug-induced chromosomal aberrations in normal and tumor cells exposed in vitro. Materials and Methods: The peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and BMG- 1 cells were exposed to radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs (bleomycin and mitomycin-C) in the presence and absence of 2 -DG. The treated cells were cultured for various durations, arrested at either metaphase or cytokinesis stage of the cell cycle. The stable and <b>unstable</b> <b>aberrations</b> were recorded using Giemsa staining and FISH technique. The cell cycle kinetics was studied using fluorescence plus Giemsa (FPG) staining. Results: The presence of 2 -DG reduced stable and <b>unstable</b> chromosome <b>aberrations</b> (CA) significantly (P < 0. 001), in PBLs induced by radiation, bleomycin and mitomycin-C, when compared to cells treated with radiation or the drugs and increased significantly in BMG cells (P < 0. 001). Furthermore, the presence of 2 -DG altered the cell cycle kinetics in the PBLs and BMG- 1 cells. Thus the overall results showed protection effect on the normal cell damages induced by radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, while sensitizes the tumor cell. Conclusion: The obtained results suggest that 2 -DG in combination with radiotherapy/chemotherapy could lead to an improvement in tumor therapy by sensitizing the tumor cells while protecting the normal cells...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — There {{have been}} several {{suggestions}} of biomarkers that are specific to high LET radiation. Such a biomarker could significantly increase the power of epidemiological studies of individuals exposed to densely-ionising radiations such as alpha particles (e. g. radon, plutonium workers, individuals exposed to depleted uranium) or neutrons (e. g. radiation workers, airline personnel). We discuss here a potentially powerful high LET biomarker (the H value) which is the ratio of induced inter-chromosomal aberrations to intra-arm aberrations. Both theoretical and experimental {{studies have suggested that}} this ratio should differ by a factor of about three between high LET radiation and any other likely clastogen, and will yield more discrimination than the previously suggested F value (ratio of inter-chromosomal aberrations to intra-chromosomal inter-arm aberrations). Evidence of the long-term stability of such chromosomal biomarkers has also been generated. Because these stable intra-arm and inter-chromosomal aberrations are (1) frequent and (2) measurable at long times after exposure, this H value appears to be a practical biomarker of high LET exposure, and several in vitro studies have confirmed the approach for <b>unstable</b> <b>aberrations.</b> The approach is currently being tested in a population of Russian radiation workers exposed several decades ago to high- or low LET radiation...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a study to}} verify an earlier report of excess chromosomal damage in the blood lymphocytes of uranium miners. Coded blood samples from 10 miners and 10 controls were analyzed conventionally for <b>unstable</b> <b>aberrations</b> and by FISH for translocations. Conventional analysis, scoring 1000 metaphases per subject, showed {{no significant difference between}} miners and controls in the frequencies of chromosome- and chromatid-type aberrations. Investigators at two laboratories undertook FISH analyses, each scoring 4000 metaphases per subject. When the data from each laboratory were examined separately, one found slightly more translocations in the miners while the other found fewer. In neither case was the difference significant at the 95 % level of confidence. Combining the data likewise showed no significant excess of damage in the miners. This applied to simple one- and two-way translocations and to cells with complex exchanges. There was no correlation between levels of translocations and total lifetime doses from occupational and/or background irradiation. A borderline significant excess of rogue cells was found in the miners. This may be a chance observation, as these rare, highly abnormal cells are considered to be unrelated to radiation exposure and are probably due to a virus. The overall conclusion is that the frequency of chromosomal damage in the miners did not exceed that in the controls. Therefore, the result of the earlier study was not confirmed. © 2001 by Radiation Research Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Damage from {{occupational}} or {{accidental exposure}} to ionising radiation is often assessed by monitoring chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and these procedures have, in several cases, assisted physicians {{in the management}} of irradiated persons. Thereby, circulating lymphocytes, which are in the G 0 stage of the cell cycle are stimulated with a mitogenic agent, usually phytohaemagglutinin, to replicate in vitro their DNA and enter cell division, and are then observed for abnormalities. Comparison with dose-response relationships obtained in vitro allows an estimate of exposure based on scoring: <b>Unstable</b> <b>aberrations</b> by the conventional, well-established analysis of metaphases for chromosome abnormalities or for micronuclei; So-called stable aberrations by the classical G-banding (Giemsa-Stain-banding) technique or by the more recently developed fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) method using fluorescent-labelled probes for centromeres and chromosomes. Three factors need to be considered in applying such biological dosimetry: (1) Radiation doses in the body are often inhomogeneous. A comparison of the distribution of the observed aberrations among cells with that expected from a normal poisson distribution can allow conclusions to be made with regard to the inhomogeneity of exposure by means of the so-called contaminated poisson distribution method; however, its application requires a sufficiently large number of aberrations, i. e. an exposure to a rather large dose at a high dose rate. (2) Exposure can occur at a low dose rate (e. g. from spread or lost radioactive sources) rendering a comparison with in vitro exposure hazardous. Dose-effect relationships of most aberrations that were scored, such as translocations, follow a square law. Repair intervening during exposure reduces the quadratic component with decreasing dose rate as exposure is spread {{over a longer period of}} time. No valid solution for this problem has yet been developed, although, in theory, both deterministic damage and aberrations might be repaired to a similar degree; a comparison of aberrations following a linear dose relationship might also help when the doses have been sufficiently large. (3) Investigations might have been possible only a certain time after the exposure. The relatively rapid disappearance of lymphocytes carrying <b>unstable</b> <b>aberrations</b> limits their use in retrospective dosimetry, years after exposure. Scoring stable aberrations, thought to persist in the circulating lymphocytes, might appear more appropriate in such situations. However, the examination of a representative number of cells by G-banding is extremely laborious, and the FISH method is not only expensive but has not yet been fully validated in different laboratories. In conclusion, biological dosimetry has serious limitations exactly for situations where the need for information is most urgent. It renders its most useful results when an individual has been exposed to a rather homogeneous high-level radiation over a short time interval, i. e. accidents at high-intensity radiation devices. On the other hand, it yielded less satisfactory information even when the most recent techniques were used for situations, where a low level, low dose rate exposure has occurred at some time in the past, for example for persons living in areas contaminated from the Chernobyl accident. Such negative experiences should be kept in mind in order to avoid futile and expensive investigations in the case of populations exposed from radioactivity and, notably, also from potentially clastogenic chemical agents...|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that rearrangements of {{chromosomes}} through breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles may cause variability of phenotypic and genetic traits within a cell population.

The temporal variation of dicentric frequency shows an inexplicable tendency towards the increase of dicentrics rate for the period of 8 - 12 years after irradiation. The association between the frequency of different types of chromosomal aberrations and such variables as smoking habits, coffee, tea, alcohol consumption, etc. was also analysed using a stepwise multiple regression analysis.

40|$|Ionising {{radiation}} (IR) is a known carcinogen and poses {{a significant}} {{risk to the}} haematopoietic system {{for the development of}} leukaemia in part by induction of genomic instability. Induction of chronic oxidative stress has been assumed {{to play an important role}} in mediating the effect of IR on the haematopoietic system. However, there was no direct evidence to support this hypothesis prior to our studies. In our recent studies, we showed that exposure of mice to total body irradiation (TBI) induces persistent oxidative stress selectively in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at least in part via up-regulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) 4. Now, we found that post-TBI treatment with diphenylene iodonium (DPI), a pan NOX inhibitor, not only significantly reduces TBI-induced increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative DNA damage and DNA double-strand breaks in HSCs but also dramatically decreases the number of cells with <b>unstable</b> chromosomal <b>aberrations</b> in the clonal progeny of irradiated HSCs. The effects of DPI are comparable to Mn (III) meso-tetrakis (N-ethylpyridinium- 2 -yl) porphyrin, a superoxide dismutase mimetic and a potent antioxidant.

40|$|In vivo {{methods are}} {{described}} to detect clastogenic and aneugenic effects of chemical agents in {{male and female}} germ cells in vivo. The knowledge of stages of germ cell development and their duration for a given test animal is essential for these experiments. Commonly, mice or rats are employed. Structural chromosome aberrations can be analyzed microscopically in mitotic cell divisions of differentiating spermatogonia, zygotes, or early embryos {{as well as in}} first meiotic cell divisions of spermatocytes and oocytes. Numerical chromosome aberrations are scorable during second meiotic divisions of spermatocytes and oocytes. The micronucleus test is applicable to early round spermatids and to first cleavage embryos, and as in somatic cells, it assesses structural as well as numerical chromosome aberrations. In contrast to the somatic micronucleus assay, the timing of cell sampling determines whether the micronuclei scored in round spermatids were formed from structural or numerical aberrations, i. e. with short treatment sampling intervals the micronuclei are formed by exposed meiotic divisions and represent induced non-disjunction. On the contrary, after longer intervals of 12 – 14 days micronuclei are formed from induced <b>unstable</b> structural <b>aberrations</b> in differentiating spermatogonia or during the last round of DNA synthesis in early spermatocytes. Furthermore, labelling with fluorescent DNA-probes can be used to confirm these theoretical expectations. The mouse sperm-FISH assay is totally based on scoring colour spots from individual chromosomes (e. g. X, Y, and 8) hybridized with specific DNA-probes. The most animal demanding assay described here is the dominant lethal test. It is commonly performed with treated male laboratory rodents and allows the determination of the most sensitive developmental stage of spermatogenesis to a particular chemical under test. Theoretically, <b>unstable</b> structural chromosome <b>aberrations</b> in sperm will lead to foetal deaths after fertilization at around the time of implantation in the uterus wall. These can be scored as deciduomata or early dead foetuses in the uterus wall of the females at mid-pregnancy. None of the tests described in this chapter provide data for a quantitative estimate of the genetic risk to progeny from exposed germ cells. The only tests on which such calculations can be based, the heritable translocation assay and the specific locus test, are so animal and time-consuming that they can no more be performed anywhere in the world and thus are not described here...|$|R

Results Colorectal cancer patients, as compared to controls, had a relatively higher frequency of chromosome 1 translocations (median: 3. 5 versus 1. 0 / 1000 cells, p = 0. 006), stable aberra-tions (3. 8 versus 1. 0 / 1000 cells, p = 0. 007) and total aberrations (p = 0. 009). There were no differences observed for chromosomes 2 and 4. Our results showed an increase in the odds of having colon cancer by about 50 – 80 % associated with an increase by 1 / 1000 cells in the number of chromosome 1 aberrations. Conclusions The results revealed that the frequency of chromosomal aberrations, especially transloca-tions in chromosome 1, seems to be a promising method to show a colon cancer risk...|$|R
40|$|Angiocardiography is an X-ray {{examination}} of the blood vessels or chambers of the heart. Cardiologists and staff members applying this procedure are exposed {{to high levels of}} scattered radiation. In our previous study the incidence of <b>unstable</b> chromosomal <b>aberrations</b> and cytokinesis-blocked micronuclei were found to be significantly higher in exposed individuals than the age and sex matched controls. In the present study we assessed cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the above cases and the percentage of Treg cells. According to film dosimeter analysis, personnels received 0. 25 - 15 mSv during the previous year (average of 3 mSv/y). Isolated PBMCs from the test and control groups were stimulated with Phorbol Myristate Acetate/ Ionomycin (PMA/I). Cytokine production was measured in the supernatants of cultured lymphocytes. The percentage of Treg cells was studied by flow cytometry. The production of IL- 10 and IL- 5 was significantly down-regulated in the test group compared to the control group. In contrast, IL- 12 was up-regulated. Yet, no statistically significant difference was found for IFN- γ between two groups. In addition, we found higher percentage of CD 4 +CD 25 +bright Treg cells in the study group compared to the controls. Taken together, it was shown that low doses of scattered X-rays could skew cytokine profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in favour of inflammatory response causing the increase of Treg cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{sensitivity}} at low {{and high}} dose exposure to X-rays was investigated by means of chromosomal aberration (CA) analysis in heterozygous ATM mutation carrier and A-T patient (biallelic ATM mutation) lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Targeted and non-targeted responses to acutely delivered irradiation were examined by applying a co-culture system that enables study of both directly irradiated cells and medium-mediated bystander effects in the same experimental setting. No indication of radiation hypersensitivity was observed at doses of 0. 01 Gy or 0. 1 Gy for the ATM mutation carrier LCL. The A-T patient cells also did not show low-dose response. There was significant increase in unstable CA yields for both ATM mutation carrier and A-T LCLs at 1 and 2 Gy, the A-T cells displaying more distinct dose dependency. Both chromosome and chromatid type aberrations were induced at an increased rate in the irradiated A-T cells, whereas for ATM carrier cells, only <b>unstable</b> chromosomal <b>aberrations</b> were increased above the level observed in the wild type cell line. No bystander effect could be demonstrated {{in any of the}} cell lines or doses applied. Characteristics typical for the A-T cell line were detected, i. e., high baseline frequency of CA that increased with dose. In addition, dose-dependent loss of cell viability was observed. In conclusion, CA analysis did not demonstrate low-dose (≤ 100 mGy) radiosensitivity in ATM mutation carrier cells or A-T patient cells. However, both cell lines showed increased radiosensitivity at high dose exposure...|$|R
40|$|There {{is still}} an open {{question}} how to predict colorectal cancer risk before any morphological changes appear in the colon. The purpose was to investigate aberrations in chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 in peripheral blood lymphocytes analyzed by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} technique as a tool to assess the likelihood of colorectal cancer. A hospital-based case-control study included 20 colon cancer patients and 18 hospital-based controls. Information about potential covariates was collected by interview. The frequency of stable and <b>unstable</b> chromosome <b>aberrations</b> in chromosome 1, 2 and 4 was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization technique. Colorectal cancer patients, as compared to controls, had a relatively higher frequency of chromosome 1 translocations (median: 3. 5 versus 1. 0 / 1000 cells, p = 0. 006), stable aberrations (3. 8 versus 1. 0 / 1000 cells, p = 0. 007) and total aberrations (p = 0. 009). There were no differences observed for chromosomes 2 and 4. Our results showed an increase in the odds of having colon cancer by about 50 - 80 % associated with an increase by 1 / 1000 cells in the number of chromosome 1 aberrations. The results revealed that the frequency of chromosomal aberrations, especially translocations in chromosome 1, seems to be a promising method to show a colon cancer risk. Additionally, our study suggests the reasonableness of use of biomarkers such as chromosome 1 aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes in screening prevention programs for individuals at higher colon cancer risk to identify those who are at increased risk and require more frequent investigations, e. g. by sigmoidoscopy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose:	The {{possibility}} of genotoxicity of radiofrequency radiation (RFR) applied {{alone or in}} combination with x-rays was investigated in vitro using several assays on human lymphocytes. The chosen specific absorption rate (SAR) values are near the upper limit of actual energy absorption in localized tissue when persons use some cellular telephones. The purpose of the combined exposures was to examine whether RFR might act epigenetically by reducing the fidelity of repair of DNA damage caused by a well-characterized and established mutagen. Methods: Blood specimens from 14 donors were exposed continuously for 24 h to a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) basic 935 MHz signal. The signal was applied at two SAR; 1 and 2 W/Kg, alone or combined with a 1 -min exposure to 1. 0 Gy of 250 kVp x-rays given immediately {{before or after the}} RFR. The assays employed were the alkaline comet technique to detect DNA strand breakage, metaphase analyses to detect <b>unstable</b> chromosomal <b>aberrations</b> and sister chromatid exchanges, micronuclei in cytokinesis-blocked binucleate lymphocytes and the nuclear division index to detect alterations in the speed of in vitro cell cycling. Results:	By comparison with appropriate sham-exposed and control samples, no effect of RFR alone could be found for any of the assay endpoints. In addition RFR did not modify any measured effects of the x-radiation. Conclusions: This study has used several standard in vitro tests for chromosomal and DNA damage in Go human lymphocytes exposed in vitro to a combination of x-rays and RFR. It has comprehensively examined whether a 24 -h continuous exposure to a 935 MHz GSM basic signal delivering SAR of 1 or 2 W/Kg is genotoxic per se or whether, it can influence the genotoxicity of the well-established clastogenic agent; x-radiation. Within the experimental parameters of the study in all instances no effect from the RFR signal was observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} of chromosome aberrations per traversal of a nucleus by a charged particle {{at the low}} dose limit increases proportionally to {{the square of the}} linear energy transfer (LET), peaks at about 100 keV/μm and then decreases with further increase of LET. This has long been interpreted as an excessive energy deposition over the necessary energy required to produce a biologically effective event. Here, we present an alternative interpretation. Cell traversed by a charged particle has certain probability to receive lethal damage leading to direct death. Such events may increase with an increase of LET and the number of charged particles traversing the cell. Assuming that the lethal damage is distributed according to a Poisson distribution, the probability that a cell has no such damage is expressed by e^, where c is a constant, L is LET, and x is the number of charged particles traversing the cell. From these assumptions, the {{frequency of}} chromosome aberration in surviving cells can be described by Y = αSD + βS^ 2 D^ 2 with the empirical relation Y = αD + βD^ 2 in the low LET region, where S = e^, αis a value proportional to LET, βis a constant, and D is the absorbed dose. This model readily explains the empirically established relationship between LET and relative biological effectiveness (RBE). The model can also be applied to clonogenic survival. If cells can survive and they have neither <b>unstable</b> chromosome <b>aberrations</b> nor other lethal damage, the LET-RBE relationship for clonogenic survival forms a humped curve. The relationship between LET and inactivation cross-section becomes proportional to the square of LET in the low LET region when the frequency of a directly lethal events is sufficiently smaller than unity, and the inactivation cross-section saturates to the cell nucleus cross-sectional area with an increase in LET in the high LET region...|$|R
40|$|From 1995 to 1996 about 15 people {{suspected}} of being overexposed to ionizing radiation were referred to the Institute for Nuclear Safety and Protection in Fontenay-aux-Roses, France, for investigation by chromosome aberration analysis. Biological estimates of accidental overexposure were first obtained by scoring radio-induced <b>unstable</b> structural chromosome <b>aberrations</b> (dicentrics, centric rings, and fragments) in peripheral blood lymphocytes. For dose estimates, the yield of these chromosomal aberrations observed in 500 metaphases was compared with the laboratory dose-response relationship established from human blood irradiated in vitro (gamma-rays, 60 Co, 0. 5 Gy/min). To extend the possibilities of detecting DNA damage from earlier exposures by visualizing stable chromosome aberrations, chromosome painting by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH painting) was developed using a cocktail of three composite whole human chromosome-specific DNA probes (numbers 2, 4, and 12). A laboratory calibration curve for scoring terminal and/or reciprocal translocations was established for the same radiation quality and dose rate as those used for conventional cytogenetics (gamma-rays, 60 Co, 0. 5 Gy/min). For dosimetry purposes, it was also important to verify whether FISH painting could be applied to each human blood sample assessed for conventional expertise. For each individual, 2000 metaphases were scored for {{the presence or absence of}} reciprocal and terminal translocations. We present here a comparison between the results obtained by the two technologies for each of the cases studied separately. We describe their similarities or differences and discuss the suitability of using FISH painting for routine expertise analysis...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} whether non-thermal levels of radiofrequency (RF) fields, characteristic of some mobile phones, might be directly genotoxic when applied in vitro to unstimulated G 0 or stimulated human lymphocytes. Also, the study aimed to investigate the possibility that RF fields might act epipigenetically when combined with x-rays, by modifying their effect when applied in vitro to G 0 lymphocytes. In addition, the possibility of RF fields inducing apoptosis in murine neuroblastoma (N 2 a) cells was also examined. G 0 lymphocytes from 4 donors were exposed for a total of 24 h to a continuous or an intermittent RF signal. The signals were 935 MHz GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) Basic, 1800 MHz GSM Basic, 935 MHz continuous wave (CW) carrier frequency, and 935 MHz GSM Talk. Stimulated lymphocytes were exposed for a total of 48 h to intermittent 1800 MHz RF signals that were GSM Basic or the carrier frequency only. The RF fields used for the 24 h exposure of N 2 a cells were all at 935 MHz and consisted of GSM Basic, GSM Talk and a CW signal. The chosen Specific energy Absorption values of the signals were either 1 or 2 W/kg. These values are near the upper limit of actual energy absorbed in localised tissue by a person from some mobile phones. The field was applied to G 0 human lymphocytes either alone or combined with an exposure to 1 Gy x-rays given immediately before or after the RF field. A dose of 4 Gy x-rays was used as a positive control for apoptosis induction in N 2 a cells and in the study with stimulated lymphocytes no x-rays were used. The lymphocytes were assayed by several standard methods to demonstrate genotoxicity. <b>Unstable</b> chromosome <b>aberrations</b> (stimulated lymphocytes and those exposed in G 0), sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and cytokinesis blocked micronuclei (MN) (lymphocytes exposed in G 0). In addition the SCE and MN assays allowed nuclear division indices (NDI) to be calculated as NDI defines the cell cycle progression of lymphocytes after PHA stimulation and how this might be affected by RF exposure. N 2 a cells were assessed by fluorescence microscopy for levels of apoptosis at a number of time points post RF field or x-ray exposure, between 0 and 48 h. Three independent assays that detect different stages of the apoptotic pathway were used, the Annexin V binding, caspase activation and in situ end labelling. By comparison with appropriate sham exposed samples no effect of RF fields alone could be found in G 0 or PHA stimulated lymphocytes exposed in vitro. Also, RF fields did not modify any measured effects of x-rays either given before or after RF exposure. No statistically significant difference in apoptosis levels were observed between RF exposed and sham exposed N 2 a cells in either a proliferating or differentiated state for any assay at any time point post exposure.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the risk for biological damage of an individual after overexposure to ionizing radiation due to an accident or a terroristic attack passes through {{the evaluation of the}} absorbed dose received from the person/s involved. This evaluation, corresponding also to how dangerous the overexposure is, using methodologies typical of the biological dosimetry, is done with the help of reference calibration curves and it presumes that all individuals exposed have the same individual radiosensitivity, which is true when the biological system into account are human lymphocytes of the peripheral blood (PBL). It supposes that a certain dose of radiation produces the same quantity of variation (chromosomal aberrations) in that biological system in all the exposed. The goal of this Ph. D. thesis is the application of various cytogenetic methodologies to detect in a reliable and possibly fast way chromosomal aberrations non stable (dicentrics and centromeric rings) in the lymphocytes of the human peripheral blood after gamma irradiation and the construction of calibration curves dose effect able to give rapidly a response of the absorbed dose in case of radiation accident. The time needed to give a reliable response on the absorbed dose is crucial and {{this is especially true in}} radiation emergency medicine. The objective was to standardize, develop and apply sophisticate, sensitive and reliable methodologies for the estimation of the absorbed doses after accidental gamma radiation overexposures for radiation protection purposes. Specifically, in the present study the following were performed: I. 	Application of the classic “golden standard” methodology of biological dosimetry which provides stimulation of the lymphocytes and Giemsa staining of the chromosomes at mitosis II. 	Development, consolidation and application of original methodologies in biological dosimetry using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes for painting specifically chromosome telomers and centromeres III. 	Application and consolidation of the method of premature chromosome condensation (PCC) where no stimulation at lymphocytes is needed IV. 	Development of a fast, sensitive and reliable methodology, absolutely original in the field of biological dosimetry for dose evaluation combining the PCC method with the FISH using PNA probes for centromers and telomers V. 	Construction for all the above methodologies, using in vitro experiments, of calibration curves dose-effect where <b>unstable</b> chromosomal <b>aberrations</b> where plotted against gamma dose given. The dose interval investigated was between 0. 3 Gy and 8 Gy; more than 12. 500 slides with metaphases and interphases were scored using Microscopic analysis of chromosome aberrations. Dose effect curves are linear quadratic and for their construction a minimum of 500 cells or 100 dicentrics per dose were analysed. The Poisson distribution of the chromosomal aberrations was tested for every dose and the coefficients alpha and beta of the linear quadratic equation, their errors and p value were calculated. Finally, all calibration curves obtained with the different methodologies were compared and the advantages of each methodology reported. ...|$|R
