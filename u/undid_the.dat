25|$|The new {{government}} decided {{to concentrate on}} developing agriculture, while doing little to help the industrial sector. Agriculture responded well with stricter quality-control being introduced and the passing of a Land Act to help farmers buy their farms. Also, the Irish Sugar Company and the Agricultural Credit Corporation were established to encourage growth. However, the economic depression that hit in the 1930s soon <b>undid</b> <b>the</b> good work of Cosgrave and his ministers. Industry was seen as secondary to agriculture and little was done to improve it. The loss of the industrialised north-east of Ireland had a bad effect on {{the country as a}} whole. However, the Electricity Supply Board, with the first national grid in Europe, was established to provide employment and electricity to the new state.|$|E

25|$|Rommel {{lost contact}} with General Hermann Hoth, having disobeyed orders by not waiting for the French to {{establish}} a new line of defence. The 7th Panzer Division continued to advance north-west to Avesnes-sur-Helpe, just ahead of the 1st and 2nd Panzer divisions. The French 5th Motorised Infantry Division had bivouacked {{in the path of the}} German division, with its vehicles neatly lined up along the roadsides and the 7th Panzer Division dashed through them. The slow speed, overloaded crews and lack of battlefield communications <b>undid</b> <b>the</b> French. The 5th Panzer Division joined in the fight. The French inflicted many losses on the division but could not cope with the speed of the German mobile units, which closed fast and destroyed the French armour at close range. The remaining elements of the 1st DCR, resting after losing all but 16 of its tanks in Belgium, were also engaged and defeated, the 1st DCR retiring with three operational tanks for a German loss of 50 out of 500 tanks.|$|E
25|$|By {{the events}} of , seven years after The Sands of Time, he has become callous and {{depressed}} due to being deprived of proper food and sleep by the Dahaka's pursuit. He decides {{to travel to the}} island where the Sands of Time were found and prevent their creation. Travelling to the time when the Sands were created, he encounters Kaileena, the Empress of Time who was created by the gods and is destined to create the Sands. The Prince kills Kaileena, but he unknowingly creates the Sands in doing so. Using an artifact called the Mask of the Wraith, the Prince travels back in time and forces Kaileena into his time, hoping to kill her there and create the Sands while saving himself. In the game's canon ending, the Prince obtains a magical sword and uses to kill the Dakaha when it attacks Kaileena after he brings her to his time. In The Two Thrones, the Prince returns to Babylon with Kaileena and finds that his actions in Warrior Within <b>undid</b> <b>the</b> death of the Vizier. The Vizier kills Kaileena, absorbing the Sands and turning into a god-like monster. The Prince is also partially infected by the Sands, which turns him into a Sand Monster hybrid and helps manifests an alternate Dark Prince personality. During his adventure, he reunites with Farah and struggles against his Dark Prince persona. Upon finding his father's body, the Prince decides to accept the consequences of his actions, gaining control over his Dark Prince self. He kills the Vizier and frees Kaileena's spirit, who purges the Sands from him and leaves with the Sands for another world. When the Dark Prince makes a final attack, Farah helps the Prince finally overcome his dark self.|$|E
25|$|A {{second major}} {{educational}} issue which arose during Chavous' third term was {{another round of}} reform aimed at the D.C. Board of Education. On September 24, 2003, Mayor Williams announced that the city's public school system was so dysfunctional and provided such low-quality education that he was introducing legislation to strip the Board of nearly all its power. Control over the school system would {{be given to the}} mayor, who would have the right to hire and fire the superintendent, principals, teachers, and other workers and who would gain significant new powers to reconstitute programs, operations, curriculum, and schools. Although Chavous was working on his own bill to give the Council and mayor more power over the school system, he immediately threw his support behind Williams' plan. But little action on the mayor's plan had been taken by January 2004. Chavous argued that Williams had not been forceful enough in making the case for his proposal, and journalist Craig Timberg linked Chavous' lack of activity on the measure to a reluctance to take on a controversial issue in an election year. (Chavous' own bill was also delayed, and he said it would not be ready until at least March 2004.) Williams said he might seek a third term as mayor merely to fight for his school reform bill, if the council did not act more expeditiously. In February 2004, Chavous announced he no longer supported the mayor's bill. The school district was without a superintendent, and Chavous argued that no individual would want the job if the council was considering such a significant change to the position. He also said that giving the mayor hiring and firing authority over the superintendent would require congressional approval or a voter referendum, and both processes would take too long. Chavous then introduced a bill which largely <b>undid</b> <b>the</b> 2000 reforms. The new bill provided for a nine-member board, with eight elected members (one from each ward) and a president elected citywide. Chavous' committee approved the bill in April 2004 without a hearing. Although Mayor Williams submitted an altered form of his original proposal two weeks after the defeat, it was rejected in mid-May and the Chavous bill approved by the council in July on a close 7-to-6 vote.|$|E

Just as the Johannine view of Jesus as the incarnate Logos proclaims the universal relevance of his birth, the Pauline perspective emphasizes {{the birth of}} a new man and a new world in the birth of Jesus. Paul's eschatological view of Jesus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to Adam. Unlike Adam, the new man born in Jesus obeys God and ushers in a world of morality and salvation.|$|E

The New Testament Gospels, composed during the late 1st century, contain the first references to the life of Mary; the New Testament Epistles, composed earlier, make no mention of her by name. There are, however, references to Mary in the Epistles, most notably in Galatians. In the 2nd century, St. Irenaeus of Lyons called Mary the [...] "second Eve" [...] because through Mary and her willing acceptance of God's choice, God <b>undid</b> <b>the</b> harm that was done through Eve's choice to eat the forbidden fruit.

2500|$|Though {{she looks}} sixteen, Fanta is {{actually}} 172 years old (since one Avalon year is about 10 earth years). She can be manipulative, especially since her innocent and sweet appearances allows others to trust her. Despite the handicap {{of being a}} half-faerie, Fanta is extremely powerful, and was even able to summon a master class gown {{in the middle of}} a magical battle against her rival Medea and the exiled god Neptune, despite the fact such a feat should have been impossible. Fanta likes life in the mortal realm so much she completely torn her dress in half to stay longer, which was why summoning a master class dress was such an impressive feat, considering how badly her regular dress was damaged. Beyond her impressive magical powers, Fanta is very agile and strong, something that comes in handy more than once while fighting evil affinities. [...] Furthermore, her body possesses the unique quality of being to absorb, store, and then release vast amounts of magical energy. [...] Because the power was dangerous, it was sealed off when Fanta was very young and she <b>undid</b> <b>the</b> seal only when Oreadia's life was threatened. [...] This quality is shared by the King of Avalon and one of the primary reasons why he wants to marry her; since both he and Oreadia noticed this aspect of Fanta before it was sealed off, Fanta has become instrumental in both their plans.|$|E
2500|$|In 724, Arab general al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami inflicted a {{crushing}} defeat on the Khazars {{in a long}} battle between the rivers Cyrus and Araxes, {{then moved on to}} capture Tiflis, bringing Caucasian Iberia under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named Barjik, launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and defeated Arab forces at Ardabil, killing the general al-Djarrah al-Hakami and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at Mosul, where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head [...] In 737, Marwan Ibn Muhammad entered Khazar territory under the guise of seeking a truce. He then launched a surprise attack in which The Qaghan fled north and the Khazars surrendered. The Arabs did not have resources to influence affairs of Transcaucasia. The QaÄŸan was forced to accept terms involving conversion to Islam, and to subject himself to the Caliphate, but the accommodation was short-lived as a combination of internal instability among the Umayyads and Byzantine support <b>undid</b> <b>the</b> agreement within three years, and the Khazars re-asserted their independence. The suggestion that the Khazars adopted Judaism as early as 740 is based on the idea that, in part, it was, a re-assertion of independence with regard to both Byzantium and the Caliphate, while conforming to a general Eurasian trend to embrace a world religion.|$|E
2500|$|The Commonwealth had {{remained}} neutral in the Seven Years' War (1756â€“1763), yet it sympathized with the alliance of France, Austria, and Russia, and allowed Russian troops {{access to its}} western lands as bases against Prussia. Frederick II retaliated by ordering enough Polish currency counterfeited to severely affect the Polish economy. Through the Polish nobles whom Russia controlled and the Russian Minister to Warsaw, ambassador and Prince Nicholas Repnin, Empress Catherine the Great forced a constitution on the Commonwealth at the so-called Repnin Sejm of 1767, named after ambassador Repnin, who effectively dictated the terms of that Sejm (and ordered the capture and exile to Kaluga of some vocal opponents of his policies, including bishop JÃ³zef Andrzej ZaÅ‚uski and others). This new constitution <b>undid</b> <b>the</b> reforms made in 1764 under StanisÅ‚aw II. The [...] and all the old abuses of the last {{one and a half}} centuries were guaranteed as unalterable parts of this new constitution (in the so-called Cardinal Laws). Repnin also demanded religious freedom for the Protestant and Orthodox Christians, and the resulting reaction among some of Poland's Roman Catholics, as well as the deep resentment of Russian intervention in the Commonwealth's domestic affairs, led to the War of the Confederation of Bar of 1768â€“1772, formed in Bar, where the Poles tried to expel Russian forces from Commonwealth territory. The irregular and poorly commanded Polish forces had little chance {{in the face of the}} regular Russian army and suffered a major defeat. Adding to the chaos was a Ukrainian Cossack and peasant rebellion, the Koliyivshchyna, which erupted in 1768 and resulted in massacres of noblemen (...) , Jews, Uniates, and Catholic priests, before it was put down by Polish and Russian troops.|$|E
