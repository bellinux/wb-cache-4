5|$|Initially, Littell {{thought that}} his book would sell around {{three to five}} {{thousand}} copies. Éditions Gallimard, his publishing house, was more optimistic and decided to print 12,000 copies. Word of mouth and the enthusiastic reviews soon catapulted sales {{to such an extent}} that Gallimard had to stop publishing the latest Harry Potter novel in order to meet the demand for The Kindly Ones, which ended <b>up</b> <b>selling</b> more than 700,000 copies in France by the end of 2007.

5|$|Prior to the 1918–19 season, {{ownership}} of the Senators changed. While Ted Dey negotiated with Percy Quinn for a lease for The Arena, Dey was also negotiating with Rosenthal over the lease, causing Rosenthal to seriously consider moving the team from The Arena back to Aberdeen Pavilion. However, {{it turned out that}} Dey was engineering a takeover of the club and Rosenthal ended <b>up</b> <b>selling</b> his share of the club to Dey, making Dey the majority owner in both the Arena and the hockey club. Rosenthal, a prominent local jeweller, had been involved with the club since 1903. Dey's machinations also helped the NHL in its continuing fight against Blueshirts owner Livingstone. The Senators instigated an agreement with the other NHL clubs, binding them to the NHL {{for the next five years}} and locking out any rival league from their arenas.|$|E
5|$|The Drug in Me Is You was speculated by news source Perez Hilton to sell {{anywhere}} from 17,000 to 20,000 copies in the United States {{during its first}} week of sales, placing it close behind predicted debuting chart toppers Eric Church (Chief), Kelly Rowland (Here I Am), and Joss Stone (LP1). The album ended <b>up</b> <b>selling</b> 18,120 copies in its first week in the United States, charting at number 19 on the Billboard 200. This almost exactly matched the first week sales of Escape the Fate (2010), the third album by Radke's former band, though Escape the Fate only charted at number 25, six spots lower than The Drug in Me Is You, despite equal sales. In its second week on sales, The Drug in Me is You dropped about 70% in the United States, selling 5,870 copies. This dropped the album 60 spots to number 79 on the Billboard 200, and brought total US sales for the album to around 24,000 copies.|$|E

40|$|Differential pricing of air {{transportation}} {{plays an important}} role in the current theories of airline seat inventory management. The ability to recognize those passengers willing to "sell up". or pay more for a seat on a given flight is also important, yet it has received little research attention. The proper detection and booking management of these passenger types can allow air carriers to realize higher flight revenues. This dissertation begins with an overview of airline pricing policies and seat inventory control management practices. Current fare structures and fare class designations are described in detail. Airline demand and consumer utility measures are then presented. Consumer behavior during the booking process. particularly in relation to <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> behavior, is discussed. Price elasticities of demand also play an important role in the prediction of <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> behavior. An in-depth description of <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> and its measurement follow. Once specific flights have been identified as having <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> potential, a <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> strategy can be implemented. Methods of testing the revenue benefits/costs of a particular <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> strategy were developed and used in an actual airline environment. A study consisting of a preliminary <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> test followed by an expanded study incorporating different <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> strategies was performed. Revenue results of the <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> strategies are presented and the impacts of each policy are discussed. Price elasticities of demand were estimated for individual fare classes. In general, <b>sell</b> <b>up</b> was found to be flight specific and more prevalent in the highest two fare classes (in terms of fare values) while being almost non-existent in lower fare classes. 1990 Also issued as an M.

Delivered in December 1900, it operated on a brass track and was powered by a battery and a motor Cowen originally intended to use in an electric fan. Cowen hoped to use the public's fascination with railroads and electricity to capture the public's attention and direct it to the goods for sale. Members of the public started approaching store owners about buying the trains instead, prompting Lionel to begin making toy trains for the general public.

25|$|A {{company called}} American Model Toys {{brought out a}} line of realistic, {{detailed}} cars beginning in 1948. In 1953 it released a budget line.

The tooling was then sold to a small company run by Andrew (Andy) Kriswalus in Endicott, New York, who operated as Kris Model Trains, or KMT. Andy Kriswalus only produced the box, stock, and refrigerator cars from the Kusan dies, and {{on some of these}} cars he mounted die-cast trucks from the Kusan tooling. After Kriswalus' death, the tooling was sold to K-Line and Williams Electric Trains, who continued to use it to produce parts of their budget lines.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} some criticisms of fair trade {{specific}} to coffee. Colleen Haight of the Stanford Innovation Review argues that fair trade coffee is merely a way to market the idea of ethical consumerism. Quality and transparency concerns regarding coffee are increasingly common amongst some consumers and coffee companies, as seen through {{the rise of the}} third wave coffee movement. Maintaining a balance between ethical and higher-quality coffee may be difficult with fair trade coffee due to what some coffee roasters deem as insufficient quality incentive within many fair-trade certified coffee farms. Deborah Sick’s research, involving interviews with coffee farmers in Costa Rica, finds that many farmers often produce more fair trade coffee than they can sell, so will often end <b>up</b> <b>selling</b> to independent buyers that will often pay more than fair trade buyers can. Some scholars are concerned of the artificial stimulation of coffee production, especially since worldwide demand for coffee is relatively inelastic.|$|E

However, Mick's music career failed and he has ended <b>up</b> <b>selling</b> CD's on a market stall in the Square, as well as running the Bridge Street café's night bistro. Josie, who has high aspirations for herself and her family, is not pleased to find out that her son has been lying about his professional status, but Josie also harbours a few secrets of her own. Josie's husband recently died, but before his death he was defrauded in a Jamaican property scam, leaving Josie bankrupt. Josie fosters a young girl named Kim (Krystle Williams), whom she claims is a distant relative of Mick's. Kim is the illegitimate daughter of her philandering husband, and after her mother's death, Josie kindly took her in instead of seeing her go into care. When Mick is finally made privy to this information he is extremely shocked and even more surprised to find out that both Josie and Kim plan to stay in Walford instead of returning to Jamaica. Despite his initial misgivings, Mick soon welcomes his mother and new sister into his home. Josie and Kim later move into number 3c Albert Square, where Josie becomes friendly with her downstairs neighbours, Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh), although Josie and Dot bicker constantly.|$|E
25|$|In Philadelphia on February 22, 1898, the estranged Mokarzel {{published}} {{the first issue}} of his second newspaper Al-Hoda (The Guidance), which became the longest-running Arabic newspaper in the United States. The first issue consisted of 18 pages of three columns each and appeared on a weekly basis. The publication expanded in November 1898 to 24 pages including six full pages of advertisement and was distributed in over forty countries. In early 1899, Mokarzel boasted that the circulation of Al-Hoda surpassed that of its main competitor, the Orthodox-inclined Kawkab America. Although claiming to be a non-sectarian publication, Al-Hoda was, like most of the New York-based Arabic newspapers, a mouthpiece to voice the confessional stances of the paper's owner. Al-Hoda was aimed primarily at the Arabic-speaking Levantine immigrants, especially the Maronite community; it reported on Ottoman politics in the Levant, political reform in Lebanon and on the environment of immigrant-run businesses. Mokarzel's brother Salloum traveled to the United States and joined the enterprise that same year. The format of the publication changed after Salloum's arrival; Al-Hoda began appearing twice weekly and was reduced to eight pages with more space reserved for paid advertisements. Despite his standing in the American Maronite community, infamy and controversy still followed Mokarzel. In 1899, the newlyweds published in Al-Hoda an apologetic article of Sophie's divorce from her previous husband and their subsequent marriage. However, Mokarzel's marriage was failing; he separated from Sophie on the same year that their defensive article was published and they divorced in 1902. Sophie returned to New York and took <b>up</b> <b>selling</b> linens before moving to South California where she started a linen shop and married her third husband, a Levantine confectioner. The Mokarzel brothers continued to print Al-Hoda in Philadelphia until late 1902.|$|E
