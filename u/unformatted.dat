25|$|Fortran {{sequential}} <b>unformatted</b> files {{created with}} one endianness usually cannot be read {{on a system}} using the other endianness because Fortran usually implements a record (defined as the data written by a single Fortran statement) as data preceded and succeeded by count fields, which are integers equal {{to the number of}} bytes in the data. An attempt to read such file on a system of the other endianness then results in a run-time error, because the count fields are incorrect. This problem can be avoided by writing out sequential binary files as opposed to sequential <b>unformatted.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{many cases}} {{diskette}} hardware was marketed based on <b>unformatted</b> capacity, and the overhead required to format sectors {{on the media}} would reduce the nominal capacity as well (and this overhead typically varied based {{on the size of}} the formatted sectors), leading to more irregularities.|$|E

The articles are indexed and were converted from scanned images using {{optical character recognition}} technology.

50|$|The Mirror, Undelete, and <b>Unformat</b> {{utilities}} were {{licensed by}} Central Point to Microsoft {{for inclusion in}} MS-DOS version 5.0. Central Point Anti-Virus and VDefend were licensed as Microsoft AntiVirus and VSafe, respectively, in MS-DOS versions 6.0 through 6.22.|$|R
25|$|In the Atari 8bit {{version of}} Ultima IV {{one of the}} floppy disks had an <b>unformatted</b> track. In its absence the player would lose on every fight, which would not be obvious as a copy {{protection}} effect right away as one could assume {{that this was just}} due to either lack of experience or proper equipment. The protection mechanism was subtle enough to be overlooked by the German distributor which originally delivered Atari 8bit packages with floppies that were formatted regularly, and thus these paid copies acted like unlicensed copies, causing players to lose every battle.|$|E
25|$|A blank <b>unformatted</b> {{diskette}} has a {{coating of}} magnetic oxide with no magnetic {{order to the}} particles. During formatting, the magnetizations of the particles are aligned forming tracks, each broken up into sectors, enabling the controller to properly read and write data. The tracks are concentric rings around the center, with spaces between tracks where no data is written; gaps with padding bytes are provided between the sectors {{and at the end}} of the track to allow for slight speed variations in the disk drive, and to permit better interoperability with disk drives connected to other similar systems. Each sector of data has a header that identifies the sector location on the disk. A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is written into the sector headers {{and at the end of}} the user data so that the disk controller can detect potential errors. Some errors are soft and can be resolved by automatically re-trying the read operation; other errors are permanent and the disk controller will signal a failure to the operating system if multiple attempts to read the data still fail.|$|E

50|$|In 1985 CPS {{released}} PC Tools, {{an integrated}} graphical DOS shell and utilities package. PC Tools {{was an instant}} success and became Central Points flagship product, and positioned the company as the major competitor to Peter Norton Computing and its Norton Utilities and Norton Commander. CPS later manufactured a Macintosh version called Mac Tools. CPS licensed the Mirror, Undelete, and <b>Unformat</b> components of PC Tools to Microsoft for inclusion in MS-DOS versions 5.x and 6.x as external DOS utilities. CPS File Manager was ahead of its time, with features such as view ZIP archives as directories and a file/picture viewer.|$|R
2500|$|Disk {{formatting}} {{is usually}} {{done by a}} utility program supplied by the computer OS manufacturer; generally, it sets up a file storage directory system on the disk, and initializes its sectors and tracks. Areas of the disk unusable for storage due to flaws can be locked (marked as [...] "bad sectors") so that the operating system does not attempt to use them. This was time consuming so many environments had quick formatting which skipped the error checking process. When floppy disks were often used, disks pre-formatted for popular computers were sold. The <b>unformatted</b> capacity of a floppy disk {{does not include the}} sector and track headings of a formatted disk; the difference in storage between them depends on the drive's application. Floppy disk drive and media manufacturers specify the <b>unformatted</b> capacity (for example, 2 MB for a standard 3½-inch HD floppy). It is implied that this should not be exceeded, since doing so will most likely result in performance problems. DMF was introduced permitting 1.68 MB to fit onto an otherwise standard 3½-inch disk; utilities then appeared allowing disks to be formatted as such.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{sizes of}} floppy disks are {{mechanically}} incompatible, and disks can fit only one size of drive. Drive assemblies with both 3½-inch and 5¼-inch slots were available {{during the transition}} period between the sizes, but they contained two separate drive mechanisms. In addition, there are many subtle, usually software-driven incompatibilities between the two. 5¼-inch disks formatted for use with Apple II computers would be unreadable and treated as <b>unformatted</b> on a Commodore. As computer platforms began to form, attempts were made at interchangeability. For example, the [...] "Superdrive" [...] included from the Macintosh SE to the Power Macintosh G3 could read, write and format IBM PC format 3½-inch disks, but few IBM-compatible computers had drives that did the reverse. 8-inch, 5¼-inch and 3½-inch drives were manufactured {{in a variety of}} sizes, most to fit standardized drive bays. Alongside the common disk sizes were non-classical sizes for specialized systems.|$|E
2500|$|The DEC Rainbow 100 (all variations) {{supported}} one FAT12 format on 80-track, single-sided, quad-density 5.25" [...] drives. The {{first two}} tracks were {{reserved for the}} boot loader, but didn't contain an MBR nor a BPB (MS-DOS used a static in-memory BPB instead). The boot sector (track 0, side 0, sector 1) was Z80 code beginning with DI 0xF3. The 8088 bootstrap was loaded by the Z80. Track 1, side 0, sector 2 starts with the Media/FAT ID byte 0xFA. <b>Unformatted</b> disks use 0xE5 instead. The file system starts on track 2, side 0, sector 1. There are 2 copies of the FAT and 96 entries in the root directory. In addition, there is a physical to logical track mapping to effect a 2:1 sector interleaving. The disks were formatted with the physical sectors in order numbered 1 to 10 on each track after the reserved tracks, but the logical sectors from 1 to 10 were stored in physical sectors 1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 9, 5, 10.|$|E

5000|$|Primarily in Japan {{there are}} 3.5" [...] {{high-density}} floppy drives that support three modes of disk formats {{instead of the}} normal two - 1440 KB (2 MB <b>unformatted),</b> 1.2 MB (1.6 MB <b>unformatted)</b> and 720 kB (1 MB <b>unformatted).</b> Originally, the high-density mode for 3.5" [...] floppy drives in Japan only supported a capacity of 1.2 MB instead of the 1440 KB capacity that was used elsewhere. While the more common 1440 KB format spun at 300 rpm, the 1.2 MB format instead spun at 360 rpm, thereby closely resembling the 1.2 MB format with 15 sectors per track previously found on 5.25" [...] high-density floppy drives. Later Japanese floppy drives incorporated support for both high-density formats (as well as the double-density format), hence the name 3mode. Some BIOSes have a configuration setting to enable this mode for floppy drives supporting it.|$|E

50|$|As {{early as}} 1988, Brier Technology {{announced}} the Flextra BR3020, which boasts 21.4 MB (a value used for marketing: its true size is 21,040 kB, 2 sides × 526 cylinders × 40 sectors × 512 bytes or 25 MB <b>unformatted).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Storage Module Drive (SMD) is {{a family}} of storage devices (hard disk drives) that were first shipped by Control Data Corporation in December 1973 as the CDC 9760 40 MB (<b>unformatted)</b> storage module disk drive.

50|$|Commodore's Amiga used {{an unusual}} format which {{got closer to}} the disk's raw (<b>unformatted)</b> {{capacity}} by eliminating the gaps between sectors and simplifying the identification data.

5000|$|The {{formatted}} disk capacity is always {{less than the}} [...] "raw" [...] <b>unformatted</b> capacity specified by the disk's manufacturer, because some portion of each track is used for sector identification and for gaps (empty spaces) between sectors {{and at the end}} of the track.|$|E
