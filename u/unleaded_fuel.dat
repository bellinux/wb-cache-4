5|$|In 1984, Holden {{introduced}} the VK Commodore, with significant styling changes {{from the previous}} VH. The Commodore was next updated in 1986 as the VL, which had new front and rear styling. Controversially, the VL was powered by the 3.0-litre Nissan RB30 six-cylinder engine and had a Nissan-built, electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Holden even went to court in 1984 to stop local motoring magazine Wheels from reporting on the matter. The engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia after 1986 had to consume unleaded petrol. Because it was unfeasible to convert the existing six-cylinder engine to run on <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuel,</b> the Nissan engine {{was chosen as the}} best engine available. However, changing exchange rates doubled the cost of the engine and transmission {{over the life of the}} VL. The decision to opt for a Japanese-made transmission led to the closure of the Woodville, South Australia assembly plant. Confident by the apparent sign of turnaround, GM paid off Holden's mounted losses of A$780million on 19 December 1986. At GM headquarters' request, Holden was then reorganised and recapitalised, separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process. This involved the splitting of Holden into Holden's Motor Company (HMC) and Holden's Engine Company (HEC). For the most part, car bodies were now manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, with engines as before, confined to the Fishermans Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder Family II engines for use in cars built overseas. The final phase of the Commodore's recovery strategy involved the 1988 VN, a significantly wider model powered by the American-designed, Australian-assembled 3.8-litre Buick V6 engine.|$|E
25|$|Lead Replacement Petrol (LRP) was {{developed}} for vehicles designed to run on leaded fuel and incompatible with unleaded. Rather than tetraethyl lead it contains other metal such as potassium compounds or methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT); these are purported to buffer soft exhaust valves and seats {{so that they do}} not suffer recession due to the use of <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Leaded petrol was {{withdrawn}} from sale in Britain after 31 December 1999, {{seven years after}} EEC regulations signalled the end of production for cars using leaded petrol in member states. At this stage, {{a large percentage of}} cars from the 1980s and early 1990s which ran on leaded petrol were still in use, along with cars which could run on <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuel.</b> However, the declining number of such cars on British roads saw many petrol stations withdrawing LRP from sale by 2003.|$|E

25|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) {{is used in}} Canada and in Australia {{to boost}} octane. It also helps old cars designed for leaded fuel run on <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuel</b> without need for additives to prevent valve problems. Its use in the US has been restricted by regulations. Its use in the EU is restricted by Article 8a of the Fuel Quality Directive following its testing under the Protocol {{for the evaluation of}} effects of metallic fuel-additives on the emissions performance of vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In Europe and Australia, the {{customer}} selects {{one of several}} color-coded nozzles {{depending on the type}} of fuel required. The filler pipe of <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuel</b> is smaller than the one for fuels for engines designed to take leaded fuel. The tank filler opening has a corresponding diameter; this prevents inadvertently using leaded fuel in an engine not designed for it, which can damage a catalytic converter. In European Union countries leaded fuel is no longer available, with LRP (lead replacement petrol) being the only fuel available for engines which need it.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 the car gained {{rear light}} units from the Citroën Ami 6, and also {{standardised}} a third side {{window in the}} rear pillar on 2CV6 (602cc) models. From 1970, only two series were produced: the 2CV 4 (AZKB) with 435 cc and the 2CV 6 (Azka) with 602 cc displacement. All 2CVs from this date can run on <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuel.</b> 1970s cars featured rectangular headlights, except the Spécial model. In 1971 the front bench seat was replaced with two individual seats. In 1972 2CVs were fitted with standard three-point seat belts. In 1973 new seat covers, a padded single-spoke steering wheel and ashtrays were introduced.|$|E

CNG buses (300- and 600-series buses) and the 900-series buses operate {{out of the}} Yale Transit Department on 601 Yale Blvd. SE, while the 700-series buses, Rapid Ride buses (6400-series, 6600-series, and 6900-series), and the paratransit fleet operate out of the Daytona Transit Facility on Daytona Rd near Unser Blvd. and I-40. Daytona operates {{seven days a week}} except on city-observed holidays. Yale operates on weekdays only. On May 1, 2015, the 900-series buses were moved temporarily to Daytona due to renovations at Yale; however, they went back to operating out of the Yale facility beginning October 19, 2015. The Yale Transit Department is now equipped with <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuel</b> to fuel shuttle cars.|$|E
25|$|At {{the launch}} of the Ninety Land Rover had insisted that there would not be a 2.5-litre {{development}} of the petrol engine. However, buyer demand and economics made the change inevitable. The larger petrol engine was launched in 1985 (having been developed under the codename 'Project Harrier') and, like its 2.25-litre predecessor it had much in common with the diesel engine. The block was identical, as were most ancillary parts. The key difference was that the petrol engine retained its timing chain, since it lacked the need to drive an injector pump. The cylinder head was adapted to use <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuel.</b> As before, the engine was smooth and refined, and provided the Land Rover with adequate road performance. However, as fuel prices rose and diesel engines improved sales of the petrol engines fell, especially in Europe. It remained a popular option in Africa and other areas where fuel prices or the simplicity of the engine made it an attractive option. It remained available until 1994; although by this time sales had dwindled to almost nothing {{in the face of a}} new generation of refined diesel engines. By this time buyers were limited to those with specific reasons to buy petrol-engined vehicles- for example several police forces in the UK bought fleets of 2.5 petrol Defenders in the mid-1990s because a diesel-engined vehicles would have caused maintenance and logistical problems when operated alongside the fleet of standard patrol cars, all of which were petrol fuelled.|$|E
500|$|By this stage, Holden's 24‑year‑old six-cylinder was {{thoroughly}} outmoded {{and would have}} been difficult to re-engineer to comply with pending emission standards and the introduction of <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuel.</b> This led Holden to sign a deal with Nissan of Japan to import their RB30E engine. This seemed a good idea in 1983 when the Australian dollar was strong; however by 1986 the once viable prospect became rather expensive. The public quickly accepted what was at first a controversial move, as reports emerged of the improvements in refinement, 33percent gain in power and 15percent better economy over the carburettor version of the VK's Black straight-six. An optional turbocharger appeared six months later and lifted power output to [...] In October 1986, an unleaded edition of Holden’s carburettored V8 engine was publicised. Holden had originally planned to discontinue the V8 to spare the engineering expense of converting to unleaded. However, public outcry persuaded them to relent. VLs in New Zealand were also available with the 2.0-litre six-cylinder RB20E engine.|$|E

40|$|The {{aviation}} industry is under pressure by the EPA {{to phase out}} leaded aviation gasoline, but traditional <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuels</b> do not work in aircraft. Purdue’s National Test Facility for fuels and propulsion in the Department of Aviation Technology has been working to help develop standards for, and certify, a replacement fuel. A bio-based synthetic fuel has been recently developed at The Purdue Research Park,as a drop in replacement for aviation gasoline. Unfortunately, at present the American Society of Test and Measurement (ASTM) has no specification for approving non-petroleum aviation fuels, but {{is in the process}} of creating that new specification...|$|R
2500|$|While {{the rest}} of the world saw 1500s with the {{compression}} ratio reduced to 8.0:1, the American market model was fitted with a single Zenith-Stromberg carburettor and a compression ratio reduced to 7.5:1 to allow it to run on lower octane <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuel,</b> and after adding a catalytic converter and exhaust gas recirculating system, the engine only delivered [...] (DIN) with a slower 0–60 time of 16.3 seconds. The notable exception to this was the 1976 model year, where the compression ratio was raised to 9.1:1. This improvement was short-lived, however, as the ratio was again reduced to 7.5:1 for the remaining years of production.|$|E
2500|$|Starting {{with the}} 2014 Formula 1 season the engines have {{changed from a}} 2.4-litre {{naturally}} aspirated V8 to turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 [...] "power-units".

Engines run on <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuel</b> closely resembling publicly available petrol. The oil which lubricates and protects the engine from overheating is very similar in viscosity to water. The 2006 generation of engines spun up to 20,000rpm and produced up to [...] For , engines were restricted to 19,000rpm with limited development areas allowed, following the engine specification freeze from the end of [...] For the 2009 Formula One season the engines were further restricted to 18,000rpm.|$|E
2500|$|The 455cubic-inch (7.46 L) Rocket V8 {{was carried}} over from {{previous}} models {{as the standard}} Toronado engine. The introduction of the second-generation Toronado coincided {{with the implementation of}} a GM corporate edict that took effect with the 1971 models; all engines had to run on lower-octane regular leaded, low lead or unleaded gasoline to meet increasing more stringent Federal (and California) emission control regulations, a goal that was reached by reducing compression ratios. This was a first step toward the introduction of catalytic converters in 1975, which mandated the use of <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuel.</b> The 1971 Toronado's 455cubic-inch V8 (7.46 L) was rated at [...] (down from 375 in 1970) with a compression ratio of 8.5:1 (down from 10.5:1 in 1970).|$|E

25|$|The {{octane rating}} of typical commercially {{available}} gasoline varies by country. In Finland, Sweden, and Norway, 95 RON {{is the standard}} for regular unleaded gasoline and 98 RON is also available as a more expensive option. In the UK, ordinary regular unleaded gasoline is 95 RON (commonly available), premium unleaded gasoline is always 97 RON, and super unleaded is usually 97–98 RON. However, both Shell and BP produce fuel at 102 RON for cars with high-performance engines and in 2006 the supermarket chain Tesco began to sell super unleaded gasoline rated at 99 RON. In the US, octane ratings in <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuels</b> can vary between 85 and 87 AKI (91–92 RON) for regular, through 89–90 AKI (94–95 RON) for mid-grade (equivalent to European regular), up to 90–94 AKI (95–99 RON) for premium (European premium).|$|R
2500|$|The 86's engine, {{known by}} the Toyota code 4U-GSE and Subaru code FA20, is a {{naturally}} aspirated four-cylinder engine that uses Subaru's horizontally opposed boxer engine design, {{with the addition of}} Toyota's D-4S injection system, which uses both direct and port fuel injection. Given its placement, the 86 can be considered having a front engine, rear wheel drive drivetrain layout. The engine runs on 98 RON (premium <b>unleaded)</b> <b>fuel</b> and features a 12.5:1 compression ratio and a bore and stroke of [...] that results in [...] at 7,000 rpm and [...] of torque at 6,000 rpm. As part of the 86's low-weight design, the car utilizes an aluminium hood, a solid roof, and a trunk as opposed to a hatchback. [...] The boxer engine sits as far back and as low as possible in the engine bay for a weight distribution of 53% in front and 47% in the rear. The low-sitting engine provides a lower center of gravity, allowing the engine to sit lower than the Nissan GTR and just 0.6 inches higher than the Lexus LFA.|$|E
2500|$|NASCAR {{has been}} the target of {{criticism}} on various topics from various sources. Some critics note the significant differences between today's NASCAR vehicles and true [...] "stock" [...] cars. Others frequently cite the dominance of the France family in NASCAR's business structure, policies, and decision making. Recently, the increased number of Cup drivers competing consistently in the Xfinity Series races has been hotly debated. Another general area of criticism, not only of NASCAR but other motorsports as well, includes questions about fuel consumption, emissions and pollution, and the use of lead additives in the gasoline. Originally scheduled for 2008, NASCAR adopted the use of <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuel</b> in all three of its top series in 2007. In 2011, NASCAR switched to E15 [...] "green" [...] fuel (15% ethanol and 85% gasoline) for all three touring series. As NASCAR has made moves to improve its national appeal, it has begun racing at new tracks, and ceased racing at some traditional ones– a sore spot for the traditional fan base. Most recently, NASCAR has been challenged on the types and frequency of caution flags, with some critics suggesting the outcome of races is being manipulated, and that the intention is not safety, as NASCAR claims, but closer racing.|$|E
2500|$|The engine has {{increased}} crankcase breathing, a low-pressure fuel return {{system and a}} baffled oil sump, to prevent engine lubricant cavitation at high engine speeds and high-G cornering. It has four valves per cylinder (instead of five on the earlier variant) and two overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank (so it is 'quad cam') and these are driven by roller chains with variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust camshafts, along with a cast magnesium alloy fixed tract length intake manifold with adjustable tumble flaps (to improve low engine speed combustion). On 98RON (93AKI) Super-Unleaded petrol it produces [...] at 7,800rpm giving it a specific power output of [...] per litre. [...] Based on a kerb weight of , {{this results in a}} power-to-weight ratio of 0.184 kW per kilogram. This engine also produces [...] of torque at 5,500rpm, 90percent of the total torque being available between 2,250 and 7,600rpm. (Using lower 95RON (91AKI) standard <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuel</b> slightly reduces engine output, and therefore performance, and slightly worsens fuel economy). Exhaust gas escapes through two '4-into-2-into-1' fan-branch alloy steel exhaust manifolds and four high-flow metallic sports catalytic converters, into twin oval tail pipes with integral dynamic silencer/muffler valves. [...] The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic MED9.1 electronic engine control units (working as 'master' and 'slave', because of the high-revving nature of the engine), and uses Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic throttle control (also known as drive by wire), comprising throttle device, accelerator-pedal module, and ECU. [...] The ignition system uses eight individual single-spark coils, using mapped direct ignition, with Bosch single iridium electrode or NGK triple-electrode long-life spark plugs. Ignition timing is monitored with the aid of four knock sensors. The engine complies with the Euro4 European emission standards. The saloon version produces 322-329grams of CO2 per kilometre (g/km), and the Avant starts from 324g/km.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{its unique}} {{position}} as the only {{area of the world}} which extensively utilizes ethanol, air quality issues in Brazil relate more to ethanol-derived emissions. With about 40% of fuel used in Brazilian vehicles sourced from ethanol, air pollution in Brazil differs from that of other nations where predominately petroleum or natural gas-based fuels are used. Atmospheric concentrations of acetaldehyde, ethanol and possibly nitrogen oxides are greater in Brazil than most other areas of the world due to their emissions being higher in vehicles using ethanol fuels. The larger urban areas of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Brasilia suffer from substantial ozone issues because both acetaldehyde and nitrogen oxides are significant contributors to photochemical air pollution and ozone formation. On the other hand, by the mid-1990s, lead levels in the air had decreased by approximately 70% after the widespread introduction of <b>unleaded</b> <b>fuels</b> in Brazil in 1975.|$|R
