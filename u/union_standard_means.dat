However, the influence of sunbeds compliant with the recent European <b>Union</b> <b>standard</b> EN- 60335 - 2 - 27 on 25 (OH) D serum levels is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the impact of standard sunbed use compliant with the European <b>Union</b> <b>standard</b> on 25 (OH) D serum modulation and well-being. METHODS: In a randomized controlled study, 25 (OH) D serum levels were measured at enrollment, after 1 week, and after completion of the 12 -week period of sunbed use with twice weekly exposure and compared with the control group without any sunbed exposure. RESULTS: In the sunbed intervention group (N = 31), a 27...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the assessment of the performance of a robust Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) chart, which is called the Trimmed CUSUM Chart. A standard CUSUM chart is based on <b>standard</b> <b>mean</b> whilst the robust CUSUM chart is based on the trimmed mean. A series of simulations have been carried out to compare the performance of trimmed <b>mean</b> and <b>standard</b> <b>mean</b> CUSUM procedures by looking at the values of the average run length (ARL) and the ratio between the ARL with a mean shift and ARL without. The results show that for normal process and a sample size of 5, the <b>standard</b> <b>mean</b> CUSUM performs better than the trimmed mean CUSUM, but their performances are equally well as sample size is increased. However, for data with one outlier and highly skewed process, which is sample are simulated from a Student T and Chi Square distributions with 4, 6 and 7 degree of freedom (suitably shifted and scaled to produce common mean and variance, i. e. m = 0 and s 2 = 1), the trimmed mean seems to perform better than the <b>standard</b> <b>mean</b> CUSUM...|$|R
