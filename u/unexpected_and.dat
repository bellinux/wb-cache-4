5|$|Like the Tom Swift, Jr. series, {{the series}} portrays Tom as a {{scientist}} {{as well as an}} inventor whose inventions depend on a knowledge of theory. The series differs from previous versions of the character, however, in that Tom's inventive genius is portrayed as problematic and sometimes dangerous. As Robert Von der Osten argues, Tom's inventions for this series often have <b>unexpected</b> <b>and</b> negative repercussions.|$|E
5|$|As for the Harii, {{quite apart}} from their strength, which exceeds {{that of the other}} tribes I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they cause panic, since no enemy can bear a sight so <b>unexpected</b> <b>and</b> hellish; in every battle the eyes are the first to be conquered.|$|E
5|$|Pinafore {{opened in}} New York on 1 December 1879 (with Gilbert onstage in the chorus) {{and ran for}} the rest of December. After a {{reasonably}} strong first week, audiences quickly fell off, since most New Yorkers had already seen local productions of Pinafore. This was <b>unexpected</b> <b>and</b> forced Gilbert and Sullivan to race to complete and rehearse their new opera, The Pirates of Penzance, which premiered with much success on 31 December. Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest, playing Pinafore alongside Pirates.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Wilma in The Bahamas were {{generally}} <b>unexpected</b> <b>and</b> primarily {{concentrated on the}} western portion of Grand Bahama. Hurricane Wilma developed on October15, 2005 in the Caribbean Sea, and after initially organizing slowly it explosively deepened to reach peak winds of 185mph (295km/h) and a record-low pressure of 882mbar (hPa). It weakened and struck eastern Mexico as a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, and accelerated northeastward to make landfall on southwestern Florida on October24. After crossing the state, Wilma briefly restrengthened in the open Atlantic Ocean, moving north of The Bahamas before weakening and later becoming an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} was <b>unexpected,</b> <b>and</b> {{almost certainly}} began some days {{before it became}} apparent at the surface. The sea floor at the eruption site is 130metres (426ft) below sea level, and at this depth volcanic emissions and explosions would be suppressed, quenched and dissipated by the water pressure and density. Gradually, as repeated flows built up a mound of material that approached sea level, the explosions {{could no longer be}} contained, and activity broke the surface.|$|E
5|$|Although Kirchner {{was known}} to have health problems, his death was <b>unexpected,</b> <b>and</b> had {{a great impact on}} the {{politics}} of Argentina. Kirchner died at an early age, while still being a highly influential figure in politics, despite not being president at the time. Presidents Manuel Quintana, Roque Sáenz Peña and Roberto María Ortiz died in office, but none of them had a political clout comparable to that of Kirchner. President Juan Perón had a similar power and died in office, but his death was not unexpected, as he had already reached the life expectancy of the time. Other figures of the history of Argentina who achieved great political clout, such as José de San Martín, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Julio Argentino Roca, Carlos Pellegrini and Hipólito Yrigoyen, all died when they were already retired from politics, or even abroad.|$|E

5|$|Based on estimations of the {{primordial}} mass required to form Uranus and Neptune, {{as well as}} bodies as large as Pluto (see below), earlier models of the Kuiper belt had suggested {{that the number of}} large objects would increase by a factor of two beyond 50AU, so this sudden drastic falloff, known as the Kuiper cliff, was <b>unexpected,</b> <b>and</b> to date its cause is unknown. In 2003, Bernstein, Trilling, et al. found evidence that the rapid decline in objects of 100km or more in radius beyond 50AU is real, and not due to observational bias. Possible explanations include that material at that distance was too scarce or too scattered to accrete into large objects, or that subsequent processes removed or destroyed those that did. Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University claimed that the gravitational attraction of an unseen large planetary object, perhaps the size of Earth or Mars, might be responsible.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{rapid advance}} south had been <b>unexpected,</b> <b>and</b> the {{perceived}} threat of invasion {{led to a}} major expansion of the Australian military. By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions, three armoured divisions {{and hundreds of other}} units. Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps, which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively. However, Australia's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once the threat of invasion had passed, and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943.|$|E
5|$|This work {{led to an}} {{interesting}} discovery. When an engine was optimized specifically for high speed, it burned perhaps twice as much fuel at that speed than when it was running at subsonic speeds. However, the aircraft would be flying as much as four times as fast. Thus its most economical cruise speed, in terms of fuel per mile, was its maximum speed. This was entirely <b>unexpected</b> <b>and</b> implied {{that there was no}} point in the dash concept; if the aircraft was able to reach Mach3, it may as well fly its entire mission at that speed. The question remained whether such a concept was technically feasible, but by March1957, engine development and wind tunnel testing had progressed enough to suggest it was.|$|E

5|$|Tzipori {{later wrote}} in his book that Sharon tricked the Cabinet into believing that the {{confrontation}} with the Syrians was <b>unexpected,</b> <b>and</b> that Sharon had in fact been planning the attack since {{the eve of the}} war. Sharon maintained that on June 6 he had ordered the IDF not to cross the Awali River and to avoid a confrontation with the Syrians. Sharon said he did order the army to prepare for a contingency plan, however, to drive on the Beirut-Damascus highway in case the Syrians attacked first. Eitan claimed that on the night before the operation, he had agreed with Sharon to prepare the IAF for the attack, in case the Cabinet approved it. Senior Israeli commanders said after the operation that Operation Peace for Galilee could have been achieved without confronting the Syrians.|$|E
