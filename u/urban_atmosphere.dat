500|$|The {{majority}} of Michigan State's academic and residential buildings are {{north of the}} Canadian National Railway. South of the CN line are service buildings such as the T. B. Simon Power Plant, laundry services, and the campus incinerator. Nevertheless, there are {{a growing number of}} academic buildings south of the railroad. The MSU Clinical Center and the Life Sciences Building are both in this part of campus, as is a nature preserve known as the Baker Woodlot. South still of the university service buildings and the CSX railroad lie thousands of acres of university-owned farmland and agricultural research related facilities such the MSU Pavilion. The proximity of the farmland to campus helps MSU retain a rural feel in keeping with its roots as an agricultural college that mixes with the more <b>urban</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of East Lansing just a mile north. Recently, The Demmer Center has been added to Michigan State University's campus.

My presentation acts in the assumption that research should establish a typology of atmospheres {{if it wants to}} besom an instrument for planners. I will present three types of <b>urban</b> <b>atmospheres</b> that result from a research project. Discussing the conditions of the emergence of the tree types of atmospheres I will show {{that there are a number}} of environmental factors that cannot be controlled by urban planners.

2500|$|The {{paintings}} are in [...] "dry fresco", painted {{on top of}} a dry plaster surface rather than into wet plaster. All the paintings appear to be the work of painters supported by discriminating connoisseurship and sophisticated patrons from an <b>urban</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> We know from literary sources that painting was widely practised and appreciated in the Gupta period. Unlike much Indian mural painting, compositions are not laid out in horizontal bands like a frieze, but show large scenes spreading in all directions from a single figure or group at the centre. The ceilings are also painted with sophisticated and elaborate decorative motifs, many derived from sculpture. The paintings in cave 1, which according to Spink was commissioned by Harisena himself, concentrate on those Jataka tales which show previous lives of the Buddha as a king, rather than as deer or elephant or another Jataka animal. The scenes depict the Buddha as about to renounce the royal life.|$|E
2500|$|As cities {{struggle}} {{to comply with}} air quality standards, the ways that trees can help to clean the air should not be overlooked. The most serious pollutants in the <b>urban</b> <b>atmosphere</b> are ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfuric oxides (SOx) and particulate pollution. Ground-level ozone, or smog, is created by chemical reactions between NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) {{in the presence of}} sunlight. High temperatures increase the rate of this reaction. Vehicle emissions (especially diesel), and emissions from industrial facilities are the major sources of NOx. [...] Vehicle emissions, industrial emissions, gasoline vapors, chemical solvents, trees and other plants are the major sources of VOCs. Particulate pollution, or particulate matter (PM10 and PM25), is made up of microscopic solids or liquid droplets that can be inhaled and retained in lung tissue causing serious health problems. Most particulate pollution begins as smoke or diesel soot and can cause serious health risk to people with heart and lung diseases and irritation to healthy citizens. Trees are an important, cost-effective solution to reducing pollution and improving air quality.|$|E
2500|$|Hassam became {{close friends}} with fellow American Impressionist artists J. Alden Weir and John Henry Twachtman, {{whom he met}} through the American Water Color Society, and over the {{following}} months he made many connections in the art community through other art societies and social clubs. He contributed works from his European stay to several exhibitions and shows. Hassam enthusiastically painted the genteel <b>urban</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of New York that he encountered {{within walking distance of}} his apartment, and avoided the squalor of the lower-class neighborhoods. He proclaimed that [...] "New York is the most beautiful city in the world. There is no boulevard in all Paris that compares to our own Fifth Avenue...the average American still fails to appreciate the beauty of his own country." [...] He captured well-dressed men in bowler hats and top hats, fashionable women and children out and about, and horse-drawn cabs slowly making their way along crowded thoroughfares lined by commercial buildings (which were generally less than six stories high at that time). Hassam's primary focus would forever continue to be [...] "humanity in motion". He never doubted his own artistic development and his subjects, remaining confident in his instinctual choices throughout his life.|$|E

Research focussed on two cities: Geneva (Switzerland) and Grenoble (France). Starting from a simple question - what prompts us to walk in town? - and an innovative methodological protocol we call the three-person walk - the author queries the implicit relations between the act of walking and atmospheres. How {{and to what extent}} do architectural and <b>urban</b> <b>atmospheres</b> affect our decisions when walking in town and influence a pedestrian's gait? By constituting two lexicons - one describing sensory configurations that are more or less favourable to walking, the other describing the types of relation possible between pedestrians and the city - the author makes two contributions to the debate on urban walking: first that there are many ways of walking; and secondly that we adapt our gait to suit - it is perhaps even shaped by - architectural and <b>urban</b> <b>atmospheres...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the ability of}} artificial neural network (ANN) models to simulate the pollutant dispersion characteristics in varying <b>urban</b> <b>atmospheres</b> at different regions. ANN models are developed based on twelve meteorological (including rainfall/precipitation) and six traffic parameters/variables that have significant influence on emission/pollutant dispersion. The models are trained to predict concentration of carbon monoxide and particulate matters in <b>urban</b> <b>atmospheres</b> using field meteorological and traffic data. Training, validation, and testing of ANN models are conducted {{using data from the}} Dhaka city of Bangladesh. The models are used to simulate concentration of pollutants as well as the effect of rainfall on emission dispersion throughout the year and inversion condition during the night. The predicting ability and robustness of the models are then determined by using data of the coastal cities of Chittagong and Dhaka. ANN models based on both meteorological and traffic variables exhibit the best performance and are capable of resolving patterns of pollutant dispersion to the atmosphere for different cities...|$|R
