Phytolithic analysis provides a meaningful method for identifying this important crop. In this paper, the silicon structure patterns in the glumes, lemmas, and paleas from inflorescence bracts in 16 modern plants of <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> and green <b>foxtail</b> from China and Europe are examined using light microscopy with phase-contrast and a microscopic interferometer. Our research shows that the silicon structure of Omega III from upper lemmas and paleas in <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> and green <b>foxtail</b> can be correspondingly divided into two groups. The size of Omega III type phytolith of <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> is bigger than that from green foxtail. Discriminant function analysis reveals that 78. 4 % of data on <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> and 76. 9 % of data on green foxtail are correctly classified. This means certain morphotypes of phytoliths are relatively reliable tools for distinguishing <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> from green <b>foxtail.</b> Our results also revealed that the husk phytolith morphologies of <b>foxtail</b> <b>millets</b> from China and Eastern Europe are markedly different from those from Western Europe.

Genetic structures were analyzed by transposon display (TD) using 425 accessions of <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> and 12 of the wild ancestor green foxtail (Setaria italica subsp. viridis (L.) P.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.), one of {{the most}} ancient domesticated crops, is {{becoming}} a model system for studying biofuel crops and comparative genomics in the grasses. However, knowledge on the level of genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) is very limited in this crop and its wild ancestor, green foxtail (Setaria viridis (L.) P. Beauv.). Such information would help us to understand the domestication process of cultivated species and will allow further research in these species, including association mapping and identification of agricultural significant genes involved in domestication. Results In this study, we surveyed DNA sequence for nine loci across 50 accessions of cultivated <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> and 34 of its wild progenitor. We found a low level of genetic diversity in wild green foxtail (θ = 0. 0059), θ means Watterson's estimator of θ. Despite of a 55 % loss of its wild diversity, <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> still harbored a considerable level of diversity (θ = 0. 0027) when compared to rice and sorghum (θ = 0. 0024 and 0. 0034, respectively). The level of LD in the domesticated <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> extends to 1 kb, while it decayed rapidly to a negligible level within 150 bp in wild green foxtail. Using coalescent simulation, we estimated the bottleneck severity at k = 0. 6095 when ρ/θ = 1. These results indicated that the domestication bottleneck of <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> was more severe than that of maize but slightly less pronounced than that of rice. Conclusions The results in this study establish a general framework for the domestication history of <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet.</b> The low level of genetic diversity and the increased level of LD in <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> are mainly caused by a population bottleneck, although gene flow from <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> to green <b>foxtail</b> is another factor that may have shaped the pattern of genetic diversity of these two related gene pools.

In Europe and North America it is planted at a moderate scale for hay and silage, and to a more limited extent for birdseed.|$|R
50|$|Karuo is {{the site}} of the oldest {{permanent}} settlement in Tibet and represents the earliest evidence for agriculture on the Tibetan Plateau. Agriculturally, the people at Karuo relied primarily on <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet,</b> while some evidence for broomcorn millet was also discovered. The oldest evidence for <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> at Karuo dates to around 3000 BC. The people of Karuo also supplemented their diet with hunting.|$|R
50|$|Setaria viridis {{is often}} {{confused}} with S. faberi, (Chinese or Giant Foxtail), which has sparse, soft {{hairs on the}} leaves and a nodding inflorescence. Setaria viridis {{is closely related to}} S. italica (<b>Foxtail</b> <b>Millet),</b> which has larger spikelets about 3 mm long and usually smooth, shiny upper lemmas. <b>Foxtail</b> <b>Millet</b> was cultivated in China by 2700 B.C. and during the Stone Age in Europe.|$|R
40|$|The {{prominent}} {{attributes of}} <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> (Setaria italica L.) including its small genome size, short life cycle, inbreeding nature, and phylogenetic proximity to various biofuel crops {{have made this}} crop an excellent model system to investigate various aspects of architectural, evolutionary and physiological significances in Panicoid bioenergy grasses. After release of its whole genome sequence, large-scale genomic resources in terms of molecular markers were generated {{for the improvement of}} both <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> and its related species. Hence it is now essential to congregate, curate and make available these genomic resources for the benefit of researchers and breeders working towards crop improvement. In view of this, we have constructed the <b>Foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> Marker Database (FmMDb...|$|R
