25|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007–2008 {{with the collapse}} in the commodities market saw the US$ gain strongly against currencies backed by weakening commodities exports. With palm oil and rubber prices falling from their peak by more than half, the rupiah came under pressure, Bank Indonesia spent US$7 billion of its $57 billion reserves in October defending the currency. Despite this, the rupiah slipped below Rp 10,000 on 23 October {{for the first time}} since 2005, and then below Rp 11,000 on 2 November, a mark last reached in 2001. On 13 November, Bank Indonesia introduced new regulations requiring foreign currency purchases over US$100,000 a month to be backed by documentation of an <b>underlying</b> <b>transaction</b> and a tax number. The rupiah closed below Rp 12,000 {{for the first time since}} 1998 on 20 October, with intraday lows below Rp 13,000. Subsequently, however, the cut in the Federal Reserve rate to 0–0.25% and Bank Indonesia support for the currency, saw the rupiah strengthen slightly to a range around Rp 11,000.|$|E

50|$|Businesses {{using the}} accrual method of {{accounting}} may recognize revenue or expense in one period and receive or pay it in another. In the intervening period {{the exchange rate}} may have changed. When an accrued item is settled, the difference due to exchange rate movement in the amount accrued and the amount settled is treated as foreign exchange gain or loss. This gain or loss is recognized {{in the same manner}} as the <b>underlying</b> <b>transactions,</b> such as an ordinary travel expense.|$|R
5000|$|An option {{should only}} be {{exercised}} {{if it is in}} the money by {{at least as much as}} the fees associated with the <b>underlying</b> <b>transaction</b> (e.g. the fee for subsequently selling an underlying which has been physically delivered). The exercise usually costs money as well.|$|E
50|$|All {{derivatives}} {{within the}} scope of FAS133 must be recorded at fair value as an asset or liability.

50|$|In trading, {{clearing}} {{is necessary}} because {{the speed of}} trades is much faster than the cycle time for completing the <b>underlying</b> <b>transaction.</b> It involves the management of post-trading, pre-settlement credit exposures to ensure that trades are settled in accordance with market rules, even if a buyer or seller should become insolvent prior to settlement. Processes included in clearing are reporting/monitoring, risk margining, netting of trades to single positions, tax handling, and failure handling.|$|E
5000|$|Taxation in Panama, {{which is}} governed by the Fiscal Code, is on a {{territorial}} basis; this is to say, that taxes apply only to income or gains derived through business carried on in Panama itself. [...] The existence of a sales or administration office in Panama, or the re-invoicing of external transactions at a profit, does not of itself give rise to taxation if the <b>underlying</b> <b>transactions</b> take place outside Panama. Dividends paid out of such earnings are free of taxation.|$|R
5000|$|Major {{differences}} distinguish {{letters of}} credit from [...] "demand guarantees"; {{in the latter}} instrument the obligation to pay is conditioned within {{the terms of the}} bank’s promise, therefore if the demand guarantee is payable upon the beneficiary’s written first demand he is assured payment notwithstanding any defence related to any other <b>underlying</b> <b>transactions.</b> Proof of default is not needed and issuers are not concerned with the underlying contract nor can they raise any defence available to the underlying contracting party.|$|R
50|$|The {{interpretation}} of the economics <b>underlying</b> a <b>transaction</b> and even {{the wording of the}} accounting standards can vary between firms. This, along with the fact that a firm's financial statements are the responsibility of the firm's management, allows management to structure transactions to achieve desired accounting results, by choosing an {{interpretation of}} the economics <b>underlying</b> the <b>transactions</b> that may be different from another party's. This use of judgment by management thus increases the chances that the earnings presented in a firm's financial statements may have been manipulated.|$|R
50|$|Transaction {{verification}} is {{the generic}} term {{to describe the}} Internet-based security method of verifying that the actual content of a transaction has not been altered by the fraudulent techniques known as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) and Man-in-the-Browser (MitB). This form of transaction protection is alternatively known as Transaction Intent Verification (TIV). Transaction Verification must utilise either Out-of-band technology (the use of two separate channels) or an independent signing device, e.g. a programmable card-reader, capable of having transactional information re-keyed into {{it in order to}} create a code cryptographically linked to the <b>underlying</b> <b>transaction</b> detail.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, {{even where}} account stated is {{recognized}} {{as a cause of}} action in and of itself, defenses such as fraud or mistake may still be asserted to the [...] "account stated," [...] as with any settlement of parties to complex transactions. In situations where no account has been proven as stated, or where the existence of an agreement between the parties on a particular amount as being correct is effectively denied, all of the defenses or counterclaims that may exist with respect to the <b>underlying</b> <b>transaction</b> are preserved, and therefore may still be litigated.|$|E
50|$|In July 2008, the Association of Financial Guaranty Insurers (“AFGI”), {{the trade}} {{association}} of financial guaranty insurers and reinsurers, estimated that, {{since its inception}} in 1971, the bond insurance industry has saved municipal bond issuers $40 billion. In addition to credit enhancement, bond insurance provides other benefits to investors, including improved liquidity for the insured securities, surveillance of the underlying transactions, and remediation of the <b>underlying</b> <b>transaction,</b> should that prove necessary. Significantly, uninsured transactions are often not monitored by rating agencies following issuance of the initial ratings and, in the event of default, bond trustees often fail to take appropriate remedial actions absent direction and indemnity from the bondholders, which is typically not forthcoming.|$|E

50|$|Andrews {{filed suit}} against TRW on October 21, 1996, {{approximately}} 17 months after she {{became aware of the}} inaccurate information on her credit report and more than two years after TRW made the two initial disclosures. Andrews alleged that TRW’s failure to verify, prior to disclosing information to creditors, that she initiated the requests or was otherwise involved in the <b>underlying</b> <b>transactions</b> was in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act’s requirement that credit reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures to avoid improper disclosures. By failing to verify that Andrews was the initiator of the requests, Andrews alleged that TRW facilitated the identity theft. She sought injunctive relief, punitive damages and other compensation.|$|R
50|$|The British Columbia Court of Appeals {{found there}} was a clear {{inequality}} between the parties due to Harry's lack of education and physical handicap, as well as the difference in class, culture, and economic circumstances between the two parties. Kreutziger's actions clearly demonstrated his power; he was very aggressive in the negotiations and was able to unilaterally modify the price for his own benefit. Kreutziger was also unable to demonstrate that the deal was in any way fair, as the price was one-quarter of the true value of the boat and license. The court rescinded the contract because of the unconscionability of the <b>underlying</b> <b>transaction,</b> ruling that the buyer was trying {{to take advantage of the}} seller's lack of knowledge of the value of the license, and ordering Kreutziger to return the boat and license to Harry, and Harry to return the payment of $3,930 to Kreutziger.|$|E

Using data on three million US patents granted between 1967 and 1999, and their citations received between 1975 and 2002, we construct {{a number of}} measures of GPTs, including generality, number of citations, and patent class growth, for patents themselves and for the patents that cite the patents. A selection of the top twenty patents in the tails {{of the distribution of}} several of these measures yields a set of mostly ICT technologies, of which the most important are those <b>underlying</b> <b>transactions</b> on the internet and object-oriented software. We conclude with a brief discussion of the problems we encountered in developing our measures and suggestions for future work in this area. ...|$|R

40|$|Contracts within {{governance}} classes, e. g. alliances or {{supply chain}} contracts, display {{a great degree}} of variation in contractual design. Different propositions have been advanced {{on the influence of}} repeated interactions on contractual complexity. In this paper, we explore the alignment between provisions in functional classes and the <b>underlying</b> <b>transaction</b> attributes. The transaction cost impact of learning via standardization of contract provisions is examined in this context. Evidence from 42 service contracts shows that contracts exhibit both a safeguarding and a coordinating function.

40|$|For {{very large}} {{databases}} {{such as those}} used by banks and airlines, cost considerations may forbid shutting down the service {{for a long period}} of time and reor-ganizing off-line. Similarly, the size of the database may preclude constructing another copy with the de-sired organization on another disk collection. Such databases need incremental on-line reorganization. References to records occur in many places in the database. If the identifier used for the record changes due to reorganization, all of these references must be changed. This paper concentrates on the problems of updating references to enable on-line parallel incre-mental reorganization to be correct while reusing ex-isting code and making minimal changes to <b>underlying</b> <b>transaction</b> processing software. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{question}} of reputational risk from an insurance industry perspective. The paper discusses the sources of reputational risk in the insurance context and points to reputational concerns that arise at both the individual firm and industry level. The paper suggests that many reputational risks arise from economic and social factors outside the industry but still carry significant implications for the industry and for insurers operating within it. The paper finally discusses some {{of the implications of}} reputational risk for public policy issues facing the insurance industry today and offers thoughts on how those risks must be addressed. The paper concludes that reputational risk is a particularly important issue for the insurance industry, given the nature of the <b>underlying</b> <b>transactions</b> themselves and the public policy challenges the industry faces. The paper concludes that the industry must continue to build its capabilities for addressing this risk. The Geneva Papers (2006) 31, 382 – 394. doi: 10. 1057 /palgrave. gpp. 2510096...|$|R
40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen on one hand an {{explosion}} in the number of e-marketplaces, including a variety of electronic exchanges in the B 2 B arena, {{and on the other hand}} the closing of or near collapse of several prominent exchanges (e. g., Chemdex/Ventro). The question addressed in this paper is what are the underlying factors that affect which transactions are likely to be supportable by eexchanges. In particular, we identify and study three factors, supplier management, idiosyncratic investments in information systems, and codifiability (i. e., digitalizability) of product and order-fulfillment specifications <b>underlying</b> <b>transactions.</b> We show that transaction codifiability plays a fundamental role in influencing the nature of sustainable contracting and IT investments in e-markets.
