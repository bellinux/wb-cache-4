5|$|The International Reborn Doll Artists (IRDA) {{originated}} at {{the first}} conference for reborn doll artists on January 21, 2005. The IRDA group was assembled in order to offer education for improved skills {{in the art of}} reborn doll creation. They offer skill building tutorials and instruction so reborners can remain <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>on</b> the newest techniques and meet others who share a common interest in reborn doll fabrication. A reborn artist can join the organization at any skill level, but members are asked to uphold a list of standards that were created by the IRDA's executive board. This ethical code stipulates the guidelines members are to follow in advertising, listing, and describing their dolls in order to divide credit fairly between manufacturers, sculptors, and artists.|$|E
5|$|Although Bede's {{narrative}} is widely accepted, an alternative chronology {{has been proposed}} by D.P. Kirby. Kirby points out that Boniface's letter to Æthelburg {{makes it clear that}} the news of Eadbald's conversion is recent, and that it is unthinkable that Boniface would not have been kept <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>on</b> the status of Eadbald's conversion. Hence Eadbald must have been converted by Justus, as is implied by Boniface's letter to Justus. The pallium accompanying that letter indicates Justus was archbishop by that time, and the duration of Mellitus's archiepiscopate means that even if Bede's dates are somewhat wrong in other particulars, Eadbald was converted no earlier than 621, and no later than April 624, since Mellitus consecrated a church for Eadbald before his death in that month. The account of Laurence's miraculous scourging by St Peter can be disregarded as a later hagiographical invention of the monastery of St Augustine.|$|E

500|$|Prior to serialisation, an {{announcement}} {{ran in the}} 4 January 1929 edition of , proclaiming, [...] "e are always eager to satisfy our readers and keep them <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>on</b> foreign affairs. We have therefore sent Tintin, one of our top reporters, to Soviet Russia." [...] The illusion of Tintin as a real reporter for the paper, and not a fictional character, was emphasised by {{the claim that the}} comic strip was not a series of drawings, but composed of photographs taken of Tintin's adventure. Biographer Benoît Peeters thought this a private joke between staff at alluding to the fact that Hergé had originally been employed as a reporter-photographer, a job that he never fulfilled. Literary critic Tom McCarthy later compared this approach to that of 18th-century European literature, which often presented fictional narratives as non-fiction.|$|E

He remained in Ethiopia until 1978, when he was sent to Port of Spain as information officer, with responsibility for editing a magazine aimed at promoting British trade. Penfold returned to London in 1981, serving as first secretary in the West Africa Department of the FCO.

500|$|In early 1944, New York mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia {{ordered a}} check on the books of all major city night clubs. City tax {{accountants}} soon investigated the Stork Club, the Copacabana, and other city night spots. By July, auditors turned in a report claiming that the clubs were overcharging patrons on tax, sending the city the proper amount and keeping the overbilled sums. On a Saturday in July, city officials arrived at the Stork Club with a court order granting permission for them to seize the club's property for the amount which was claimed to be overcharged as taxes, plus penalties. [...] The total for the Stork Club was $181,000. Billingsley, out of town with his family, was notified. [...] The club's employees refused to turn anything over to the officials, who were intent on closing it. Upon his return, Billingsley firmly protested that the Stork Club did not owe the city any money and was <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>on</b> its tax payments. A compromise was reached: the club could stay open as long as a custodian for the city was allowed to be on the premises. Billingsley was eventually able to get a court order to eject the custodian, but the case dragged on for five years, costing Billingsley $100,000.|$|E

2500|$|To maintain, and in {{some areas}} regain, contact with enemy forces, Ridgway allowed each corps to start toward line Kansas as it {{completed}} preparations.

MacArthur agreed with the Operation Rugged and Operation Dauntless concept, urging in particular that Ridgway make a strong effort to hold the Kansas line. At the same time, MacArthur believed that the two operations would move the battlefront to that [...] "point of theoretical stalemate" [...] he had predicted in early March. He intended to limit offensive operations, once Ridgway's forces reached their Kansas-Wyoming objectives, to reconnaissance and combat patrols, none larger than a battalion.|$|E
