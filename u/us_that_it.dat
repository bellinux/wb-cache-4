5|$|In May 1958, Britain had {{informed}} that <b>US</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would be willing}} to join a testing moratorium on 31 October 1958, by which point it would have finished its hydrogen-bomb testing, conditional on the US providing Britain with nuclear information following amendment of the McMahon Act. The US Congress approved amendments permitting greater collaboration in late June. Following Soviet assent on 30 August 1958 to the one-year moratorium, the three countries conducted a series of tests in September and October. At least 54 tests were conducted by the US and 14 by the Soviet Union in this period. On 31 October 1958 the three countries initiated test-ban negotiations (the Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Tests) and agreed to a temporary moratorium (the Soviet Union joined the moratorium shortly after this date). The moratorium would last for close to three years.|$|E

That is, special relativity gives the right formula for computing such relative velocity.|$|E
25|$|Regarding the {{quotation}} in Jude, most of early Christianity considered it an independent quotation pre-dating the flood. Regarding the Book of Enoch itself Origen, Jerome and Augustin mention it, {{but as of}} no authority. Justin, Athenagoras, Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Lactantius, and others borrowed an opinion out of this book of Enoch, that the angels had sexual relations with the daughters of men, of whom they had offspring ('the giants of the past'). Tertullian, in several places, speaks of this book with esteem and would persuade <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was preserved by Noah during the deluge.|$|E
25|$|The Hurrians had a {{reputation}} in metallurgy. The Sumerians borrowed their copper terminology from the Hurrian vocabulary. Copper was traded south to Mesopotamia from the highlands of Anatolia. The Khabur Valley had a central position in the metal trade, and copper, silver and even tin were accessible from the Hurrian-dominated countries Kizzuwatna and Ishuwa situated in the Anatolian highland. Gold was in short supply, and the Amarna letters inform <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was acquired from Egypt. Not many examples of Hurrian metal work have survived, except from the later Urartu. Some small fine bronze lion figurines were discovered at Urkesh.|$|E

500|$|On {{both of his}} Philippine trips as Secretary of War, Taft went to Japan, and {{met with}} {{officials}} there. The meeting in July 1905 came {{a month before the}} conference which would end the Russo-Japanese War with the Treaty of Portsmouth. Taft met with Japanese Prime Minister Katsura Tarō. After that meeting, the two signed [...] a memorandum, with Japan indicating it had no desire to invade the Philippines, and the <b>U.S.</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> did not object to Japanese control of Korea. There were U.S. concerns about the number of Japanese laborers coming to the American West Coast, and during Taft's second visit, in September 1907, Tadasu Hayashi, the foreign minister, informally agreed to issue fewer passports to them.|$|E
500|$|James I, {{who was a}} {{confirmed}} dog-lover, also built a huge kennel (about [...] long) and dog-yard (over half an acre in size) at Royston. [...] He seems to have loved Royston and spent considerable time there, hunting and feasting and enjoying himself—so much so that his favourite dog, Jowler, returned one evening with a note tied to his collar. [...] The note read: [...] "Good Mr Jowler, we pray you {{to speak to the}} King (for he hears you every day and so he doth not <b>us)</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will please His Majesty to go back to London, for else the country will be undone; all our provision is spent already and we are not able to entertain him longer." ...|$|E

[...] Reyes informs Scully she is a [...] "9" [...] which means she has risen above the other numbers and understands that there is more to life than this world. [...] The clock shows <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is 9:09 pm. [...] In a nearby Italian neighborhood, an Italian festival is in progress. [...] Two men sing a jovial song in Italian and lead a crowd through the streets. [...] The camera zooms out to reveal that the entire neighborhood, when viewed from above, suggests the appearance of Burt's face, hinting at the fact that he might be God.|$|E

500|$|Dylan's contemporaries in 1965 {{were both}} startled and {{challenged}} by the single. Paul McCartney remembered going around to John Lennon's house in Weybridge to hear the song. According to McCartney, [...] "It seemed {{to go on and}} on forever. It was just beautiful... He showed all of <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was possible to go a little further." [...] Frank Zappa had a more extreme reaction: [...] "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it {{in the way that they}} should have." [...] Nearly forty years later, in 2003, Elvis Costello commented on the innovative quality of the single. [...] "What a shocking thing to live in a world where there was Manfred Mann and the Supremes and Engelbert Humperdinck and here comes 'Like a Rolling Stone'".|$|E
500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E
500|$|Clayton's {{findings}} did {{not have}} any practical application {{until the end of the}} 18th century. The gas produced during the coking of coal was allowed to escape unused until William Murdoch began to promote coal gas as an illuminant. Other such experiments, though limited in depth, had been done by: George Dixon in 1780 in Cockfield, Jean-Pierre Minckelers in 1785 in Louvain, and Archibald Cochrane in 1787 at his estate Culross Abbey. The true prototypes for later gasworks were first constructed in 1802 at the Soho Foundry and in 1805 at George Lee's cotton mill in Salford close to Manchester. However innovative the new technology, it was met with great skepticism by many critics. As late as 1810 Murdock was asked in a committee of the House of Commons: [...] "Do you mean to tell <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will be possible to have a light without a wick?" [...] Not until the second decade of the 19th century did gaslight spread from industrial mills to urban street lighting and domestic lighting. Accum played a crucial role in this unfolding revolution.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many praising the developing relationship between Pam and Jim. Travis Fickett from IGN praised the episode and compared Jim and Pam's {{relationship in the}} first season {{to that of the}} fourth, saying, [...] "Jim and Pam simply work better before they were a couple. The fact that Roy can come between them here is fun – and reminds <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was more interesting when something could still come between them!" [...] In summary, he concluded that, [...] "is one of the better early episodes of the show, and going out with Dwight talking to the camera – his hair dyed blonde – is genius and gives us (up to this point) the most perfect 'Dwight' moment of the show so far." [...] Television critic Robin Pierson noted that in the episode, [...] "The Jim and Pam relationship begins to take real shape here." [...] He later called the moment when Roy nearly attacks Jim as [...] "a much more 'real' moment {{that the rest of the}} episode." [...] Furthermore, Pierson criticized the characterization of Dwight, noting that his actions were [...] "stupidly naïve". [...] Miss Alli from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A.|$|E
500|$|.....a {{great number}} of citizens, {{in various parts of}} the United States, are preparing, and many have {{actually}} emigrated to this Territory, to get free from a Government which does tolerate slavery ... And although it is contended by some, that, at this day, there is a great majority in favor of slavery, whilst the opposite opinion is held by others, the fact is certainly doubtful. But when we take into consideration the vast emigration into this Territory, and of citizens, too, decidedly opposed to the measure, we feel satisfied that, at all events, Congress will suspend any legislative act on this subject until we shall, by the constitution, be admitted into the Union, and have a right to adopt such a constitution, in this respect, as may comport with the wishes of a majority of the citizens.... The toleration of slavery is either right or wrong; and if Congress should think, with <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is wrong, that it is inconsistent with the principles upon which our future constitution is to be formed, your memorialists will rest satisfied that, at least, this subject will not be by them taken up until the constitutional number of the citizens of this Territory shall assume that right.|$|E
500|$|David Lynch uses various {{methods of}} {{deception}} in Mulholland Drive. A shadowy figure named Mr. Roque, {{who seems to}} control film studios, is portrayed by dwarf actor Michael J. Anderson (also from Twin Peaks). Anderson, who has only two lines and is seated in an enormous wooden wheelchair, was fitted with oversized foam prosthetic arms and legs in order to portray his head as abnormally small. During Adam and Camilla's party, Diane watches Camilla (played by Harring) with Adam on one arm, lean over and deeply kiss the same woman who appeared as Camilla (Melissa George) before the blue box was opened. Both then turn and smile pointedly at Diane. Film critic Franklin Ridgway writes that the depiction of such a deliberate [...] "cruel and manipulative" [...] act makes it unclear if Camilla is as capricious as she seems, or if Diane's paranoia is allowing the audience only {{to see what she}} senses. In a scene immediately after Betty's audition, the film cuts to a woman singing without apparent accompaniment, but as the camera pulls backwards, the audience sees that it is a recording studio. In actuality, it is a sound stage where Betty has just arrived to meet Adam Kesher, that the audience realizes as the camera pulls back further. Ridgway insists that such deception through artful camera work sets the viewer full of doubt about what is being presented: [...] "It is as if the camera, in its graceful fluidity of motion, reassures <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> (thinks it) sees everything, has everything under control, even if we (and Betty) do not." ...|$|E

500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment {{published}} by HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of the episode, Benioff spoke {{about the relationship between}} Sansa Stark and Jon Snow {{at this point in the}} season, saying [...] "Over the course of this season they've come to really rely upon each other, but she doesn't really trust him completely. She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about that and a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. So I think we have to be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|E
