5|$|An ambush predator, the Pacific {{angelshark}} conceals {{itself on}} the sea floor and waits for approaching prey, primarily bony fishes and squid. Prey are targeted visually and, with a quick <b>upward</b> <b>thrust</b> of the head, snatched in protrusible jaws. Individual sharks actively choose ideal ambush sites, where they stay for several days {{before moving on to}} a new one. This species is more active at night than during the day, when it stays buried in sediment and seldom moves. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, with the embryos hatching inside the mother's uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac until birth. Females give birth to an average of six young every spring.|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinctive}} four-flippered body-shape {{has caused}} considerable speculation {{about what kind}} of stroke plesiosaurs used. The only modern group with four flippers are the sea turtles, which only use the front pair for propulsion. Conybeare and Buckland had already compared the flippers with bird wings. However, such a comparison was not very informative, as the mechanics of bird flight in this period were poorly understood. By {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, it was typically assumed that plesiosaurs employed a rowing movement. The flippers would have been moved forward in a horizontal position, to minimise friction, and then axially rotated to a vertical position in order to be pulled to the rear, causing the largest possible reactive force. In fact, such a method would be very inefficient: the recovery stroke in this case generates no thrust and the rear stroke generates an enormous turbulence. In the early twentieth century, the newly discovered principles of bird flight suggested to several researchers that plesiosaurs like turtles and penguins made a flying movement while swimming. This was e.g. proposed by Eberhard Fraas in 1905, and in 1908 by Othenio Lothar Franz Anton Louis Abel. When flying, the flipper movement is more vertical, its point describing an oval or [...] "8". Ideally, the flipper is first moved obliquely to the front and downwards and then, after a slight retraction and rotation, crosses this path from below to be pulled to the front and upwards. During both strokes, down and up, according to Bernoulli's principle, forward and <b>upward</b> <b>thrust</b> is generated by the convexly curved upper profile of the flipper, the front edge slightly inclined relative to the water flow, while turbulence is minimal. However, despite the evident advantages of such a swimming method, in 1924 the first systematic study on the musculature of plesiosaurs by David Meredith Seares Watson concluded they nevertheless performed a rowing movement.|$|E

For example, WebMD recommends the rescuer placing his or her fist just above the person's bellybutton and grasping it with the other hand. To assist a larger person, more force may be needed.

From {{the time of the}} first appearance of the Dervishes the fat clergyman of Birmingham had looked like a man in a cataleptic trance. He had neither moved nor spoken. But now he suddenly woke at a bound into strenuous and heroic energy. It may have been the mania of fear, or it may have been the blood of some Berserk ancestor which stirred suddenly in his veins; but he broke into a wild shout, and, catching up a stick, he struck right and left among the Arabs with a fury which was more savage than their own. One who helped to draw up this narrative has left it upon record that, of all the pictures which have been burned into his brain, there is none so clear as that of this man, his large face shining with perspiration, and his great body dancing about with unwieldy agility, as he struck at the shrinking, snarling savages.

50|$|A {{stressed}} {{ribbon bridge}} (also stress-ribbon bridge or catenary bridge) is a tension structure (similar {{in many ways}} to a simple suspension bridge). The suspension cables are embedded in the deck which follows a catenary arc between supports. Unlike the simple span, the ribbon is stressed in traction, which adds to the stiffness of the structure (simple suspension spans tend to sway and bounce). The supports in turn support <b>upward</b> <b>thrusting</b> arcs that allow the grade to be changed between spans (where multiple spans are used). Such bridges are typically made from concrete reinforced by steel tensioning cables. Where such bridges carry vehicle traffic {{a certain degree of}} stiffness is required to prevent excessive flexure of the structure, obtained by stressing the concrete in compression.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{studying}} {{the transition of}} annular lift fan aircraft through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The oscillations of lift and drag, the optimization for the figure of merit, and the characteristics of drag, yawing, rolling and pitching moments in transition are studied. The results show that a two-stage upper and lower fan lift system can generate oscillations of lift and drag in transition, while a single-stage inner and outer fan lift system can eliminate the oscillations. The characteristics of momentum drag of the single-stage fans in transition are {{similar to that of}} the two-stage fans, but with the peak of drag lowered from 0. 63 to 0. 4 of the aircraft weight. The strategy to start transition from a negative angle of attack − 21 ° further reduces the peak of drag to 0. 29 of the weight. The strategy also reduces the peak of pitching torque, which needs <b>upward</b> extra <b>thrusts</b> of 0. 39 of the weight to eliminate. The peak of rolling moment in transition needs differential <b>upward</b> <b>thrusts</b> of 0. 04 of the weight to eliminate. The requirements for extra thrusts in transition lead to a total thrust–weight ratio of 0. 7, which makes the aircraft more efficient for high speed cruise flight (higher than 0. 7 Ma) ...|$|R
5000|$|The taxi {{also has}} a limited fuel supply. The fuel level resets {{at the end of}} each level, but on some of the more {{complicated}} screens it is necessary to refuel. This is accomplished by flying to a special platform marked with an [...] "F" [...] and containing a gas pump. The player must pay for fuel out of the money he has earned. Passengers do not make allowances for pitstops, and their tip will continue to decrease as the player tanks up. The taxi's fuel consumption is based upon the time spent in the air, not how much the thrusters are used, so if a player needs to get from one side of the screen to the other, it consumes less fuel (though is more dangerous) to accelerate halfway across the screen and then reverse thrust, than to use one small thrust to move slowly across the screen and occasional <b>upward</b> <b>thrusts</b> to maintain altitude.|$|R

50|$|The {{advanced}} {{medical procedure}} to remove such foreign objects is {{inspection of the}} airway with a laryngoscope or bronchoscope, and removal of the object under direct vision. Severe cases where there is an inability to remove the object may require cricothyrotomy (emergency tracheostomy). Cricothyrotomy involves making an incision in a patient's neck and inserting a tube into the trachea in order to bypass the upper airways. The procedure is usually only performed when other methods have failed. In many cases, an emergency tracheostomy can save a patient's life, but if performed incorrectly, it may end the patient’s life. Multiple evidence suggest, that one of promising approaches for self treatment during choking could be by applying the head-down (inversed) position The Heimlich Maneuver (abdominal thrusts) can be performed on oneself with one's own hands the same way one would perform it on another person; this can also be affected by positioning one's own abdomen over a chair, railing, or countertop and driving the abdomen upon the object with sharp, <b>upward</b> <b>thrusts</b> {{as a substitute for}} thrusts made with the hands.|$|R

50|$|Deflected {{slipstream}} is {{an approach}} to creating an aircraft that can take off and land vertically (VTOL), or at least with a very short runway (STOL).

50|$|For aircraft, {{the method}} was {{originally}} envisaged to provide <b>upward</b> vertical <b>thrust</b> {{as a means}} to give aircraft vertical (VTOL) or short (STOL) takeoff and landing ability. Subsequently, it was realized that using vectored thrust in combat situations enabled aircraft to perform various maneuvers not available to conventional-engined planes. To perform turns, aircraft that use no thrust vectoring must rely on aerodynamic control surfaces only, such as ailerons or elevator; craft with vectoring must still use control surfaces, but to a lesser extent.|$|R
