40|$|AbstractThere is {{a current}} need for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (<b>UAV)</b> <b>systems</b> {{architecture}} generation and assessment models. Architecture assessment models that presently exist {{tend to be}} fractional and do not account for all dynamic attributes {{that should be considered}} in the architecture assessment. There are infinite possibilities of architecture assessment modeling methods {{that can be used to}} assess conceptual systems architecture. Developing a good architecture assessment model for evaluating the functional and systems architecture reduces system ambiguity while increasing the tangibility of the system. This paper will present an assessment model specifically for <b>UAV</b> <b>systems</b> and this model can also be adapted to virtually any type of complex adaptive system. On new complex <b>UAV</b> <b>systems</b> it is essential evaluate the appropriate Level of Autonomy (LOA) required to satisfy customer and mission requirements. The assessment model detailed in this paper combines known design heuristics with quantitative, qualitative, and visual representations that assess the probability that the generated architecture will meet performance and capability requirements. The architecture assessment model will assess and generate a combined score that will indicate if the architecture is acceptable or unacceptable. Future <b>UAV</b> <b>systems</b> may reach a LOA that would be considered as Artificial Intelligence (AI); and this pursuit will increase the need for advanced LOA architecture modeling and assessment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} secure control architecture for <b>UAV</b> control <b>system</b> {{for multiple}} operator environments. Multiple access of UAV is necessary because UAV must capture and process various data and UAV's functions become {{more complex and}} diverse. From this perspective, <b>UAV</b> control <b>system</b> needs to be secure because new control system will be exposed to multiple operators. To discuss this issue, the paper proposes new control architecture for UAV using RBAC (Roll Based Access Control). Generally, RBAC is applied and contributes {{to the security of}} computer systems, thus, we modified RBAC to apply to <b>UAV</b> control <b>system.</b> In this paper, we present how the modified RBAC model can be applied to <b>UAV</b> control <b>systems</b> and implement a prototype <b>UAV</b> control <b>system</b> based on the modified RBAC model...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} <b>UAV</b> <b>systems</b> {{is an active}} {{research}} area with potential for development and enhancement in various perspectives. This thesis investigates different {{issues related to the}} design, operation and control of <b>UAV</b> <b>systems</b> with a focus on the application side of each proposed solution where the implementation side and applicability of the proposed solutions are always considered with high priority. The thesis discusses unmodeled actuator dynamics and their effect on <b>UAV</b> <b>systems</b> when using feedback linearisation to linearize nonlinear models of UAVs. The analysis shows potential risk when implementing feedback linearisation and neglecting actuator dynamics even for first order actuator system. A solution algorithm of two stage feedback linearisation is proposed to handle actuator dynamics and linearize the main dynamics of the system. In the field of design and operation of UAVs, this thesis proposes a systematic design procedure for electric propulsion systems that are widely used in UAVs. The design procedure guides the designer step by step to achieve minimum propulsion system weight or maximum flight time or a trade off between the two factors from the supplied solution sets. On the navigation side, the thesis proposes a new indoor navigation system that is easy to implement and less costly compared with other indoor navigation systems. The proposed system can be classified under computer-vision based navigation systems, however, it needs less information and less computational capacity. The thesis also contributes to the structure design of <b>UAV</b> <b>systems</b> by producing a novel tri-rotor UAV platform. The proposed UAV is novel in structure and design and has a centralized control system that stabilizes and tracks both rotational and transitional motion of the vehicle simultaneously...|$|R
