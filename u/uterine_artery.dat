25|$|<b>Uterine</b> <b>artery</b> ligation, {{sometimes}} also laparoscopic occlusion of uterine arteries are {{minimally invasive}} methods to limit blood {{supply of the}} uterus by a small surgery that can be performed transvaginally or laparoscopically. The principal mechanism of action may be similar like in UAE but is easier to perform and fewer side effects are expected.|$|E
25|$|Surgery {{may be used}} if medical {{management}} fails or in case of cervical lacerations or tear or uterine rupture. Methods used {{may include}} <b>uterine</b> <b>artery</b> ligation, ovarian artery ligation, internal iliac artery ligation, selective arterial embolization, B-lynch suture, and hysterectomy. Bleeding caused by traumatic causes should be management by surgical repair.

25|$|<b>Uterine</b> <b>artery</b> {{embolization}} (UAE) is a noninvasive {{procedure that}} blocks of {{blood flow to}} fibroids and thus can treat them.

One review found that UAE doubles the future risk of miscarriage. UAE also appears to require more repeat procedures than if surgery was done initially. A person will usually recover from the procedure within a few days.|$|E
40|$|Chronic hypoxia during {{gestation}} has profound {{adverse effects}} on the adaptation of uteroplacental circulation in pregnancy. Yet, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The present study tested the hypothesis that enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> plays {{a critical role in}} the maladaptation of uterine circulation associated with chronic hypoxia. <b>Uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> were isolated from nonpregnant and near-term pregnant sheep maintained at sea level (, 300 m) or exposed to high-altitude (3801 m) hypoxia for 110 days. Hypoxia significantly increased ROS production in <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> of pregnant, but not nonpregnant, sheep. This was associated with a significant increase in NADPH oxidase (Nox) 2, but not Nox 1 or Nox 4, protein abundance and total Nox activity in <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> of pregnant animals. Chronic hypoxia significantly increased pressure-dependent uterine arterial myogenic tone in pregnant sheep, which was abrogated by a Nox inhibitor apocynin. Additionally, the hypoxia-induced increase in myogenic reactivity of <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> to phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate in pregnant sheep was blocked by apocynin and tempol. In consistence with the myogenic responses, the hypoxia-mediated down-regulation of BKCa channel activity in <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> of pregnant animals was reversed by apocynin. The findings suggest that heightened oxidative stress in <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> {{plays a key role in}} suppressing the BKCa channel activity, resulting in increased myogenic reactivity and maladaptation of uteroplacenta...|$|R

25|$|Treatment is {{typically}} not needed {{if there are}} no symptoms. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may help with pain and bleeding while paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with pain. Iron supplements may be needed in those with heavy periods. Medications of the gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist class may decrease the size of the fibroids but are expensive and associated with side effects. If greater symptoms are present, surgery to remove the fibroid or uterus may help. <b>Uterine</b> <b>artery</b> embolization may also help. Cancerous versions of fibroids are very rare and are known as leiomyosarcomas. They do not appear to develop from benign fibroids.|$|E
25|$|Decreased inhibin {{feedback}} after hysterectomy is {{hypothesized to}} contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause. Hastened ovarian aging has been observed after endometrial ablation. While {{it is difficult to}} prove that these surgeries are causative, it has been hypothesized that the endometrium may be producing endocrine factors contributing to the endocrine feedback and regulation of the ovarian stimulation. Elimination of this factors contributes to faster depletion of the ovarian reserve. Reduced blood supply to the ovaries that may occur as a consequence of hysterectomy and <b>uterine</b> <b>artery</b> embolisation has been hypothesized {{to contribute to}} this effect.|$|E
25|$|Blood is {{supplied}} to the vagina via the vaginal arteries, {{branches of the}} internal iliac arteries. These form two vessels called the azygos arteries which lie on the midline of the anterior and posterior vagina. Other arteries which supply the vagina include branches of the <b>uterine</b> <b>artery,</b> the middle rectal artery, and the internal pudendal artery, all branches of the internal iliac artery. Three groups of lymphatic vessels accompany these arteries; the upper group accompanies the vaginal branches of the uterine artery; a middle group accompanies the vaginal arteries; and the lower group, draining lymph from the area outside the hymen, drain to the inguinal lymph nodes.|$|E
30|$|In around 6 % of patients, fibroid size {{could not}} be reduced despite correct embolisation.

40|$|Introduction: This is {{the first}} case of total rectal and anal canal {{necrosis}} following <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> embolization described in the literature. Presentation of case: A 34 year-old woman suffered from massive Post Partum Haemorrhage. A vascular surgeon performed bilateral <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> embolization with absorbable gelatin sponge which did not allowed a sufficient control of the bleeding, leading to hysterectomy. Perineal gangrene was diagnosed on day 10 on CT scan, pelvic MRI, and rectosigmoidoscopy. The etiology was a rectal ischaemia going from {{the level of the}} second sacral vertebra to the anal canal. Drainage and a lateral laparoscopic sigmoidostomy were associated to antibiotherapy. Discussion: Ornan et al. described complications of bilateral <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> embolization in a serie of 28 patients with post partum haemorrhage. One of these patients presented a necrotic segment of small bowel 7 days after the embolization, she required a surgery. The hypothesis for these kinds of complications is the migration of the gelatine sponge particles. Conclusion: This rare but life-threatening complication has never been reported before and should be known when considering perineal pain after bilateral <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> embolization...|$|R

25|$|<b>Uterine</b> <b>artery</b> {{embolization}} (UAE) is a {{minimally invasive}} procedure for treatment of uterine fibroids. Under local anesthesia a catheter is introduced into the femoral artery at the groin and advanced under radiographic control into the uterine arterty. A mass of microspheres or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) material (an embolus) is injected into the uterine arteries in order to block {{the flow of blood}} through those vessels. The restriction in blood supply usually results in significant reduction of fibroids and improvement of heavy bleeding tendency. The 2012 Cochrane review comparing hysterectomy and UAE did not find any major advantage for either procedure. While UAE is associated with shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to normal daily activities, it was also associated with a higher risk for minor complications later on. There were no differences between UAE and hysterectomy with regards to major complications.|$|E

[...] Larvae of an infected foetus will move to the liver until birth at which point migration continues with movement to the intestine via the circulation and lungs as previously described. [...] Alternatively A. caninum larvae evading exit from the circulation at the lungs may instead be carried to the mammary glands and transmitted from the mother in her colostrum or milk to her pups; infection then proceeds in an identical manner to infection by ingestion from the environment. [...] Infected bitches {{have been found to}} only rarely give prenatal transmission to pups while the likelihood of nursing of pups causing transmission (via the lactational route) is much higher.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} tested the {{hypothesis}} that gestational hypoxia up-regulates protein kinase C (PKC) and inhibits calcium-activated potassium channels (KCa) -mediated relaxations of <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> in pregnancy. Study design: <b>Uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> were isolated from nonpregnant (NPUA) and pregnant (PUA) (~ 140 day gestation) sheep maintained at either sea level or high altitude (3, 820 m for 110 days, PaO 2 : 60 mmHg). Contractions of <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> were determined. Key findings: In normoxic PUA, selective inhibition of large-conductance KCa (BK) channels significantly enhanced PKC activator phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate (PDBu) -induced contractions. This effect was abrogated by chronic hypoxia in gestation. Unlike BK channels, inhibition of small-conductance KCa (SK) channels had no significant effect on PDBu-mediated contractions. In normoxic PUA, activation of both BK with NS 1619 or SK with NS 309 produced concentration-dependent relaxations, which were not altered {{by the addition of}} PDBu. However, in <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> treated with chronic hypoxia (10. 5 % O 2 for 48 h), both NS 1619 - and NS 309 -induced relaxations were significantly attenuated by PDBu. In NPUAs, inhibition of BK channels significantly enhanced PDBu-induced contractions in both normoxic and hypoxic animals. Conclusion: The results suggest that in the normoxic condition BK inhibits PKC activity and uterine vascular contractility, which is selectively attenuated by chronic hypoxia during gestation. In addition, hypoxia induces PKC-mediated inhibition of BK and SK activities and relaxations of <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> in pregnancy...|$|R
50|$|In {{pregnant}} women, {{there is}} a 30% increase in intracellular 2,3-BPG.

30|$|A new {{alternative}} approach leading to effective restriction of blood circulation in leiomyoma is bilateral laparascopic ligation of both <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> and anastomotic sites of <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> with ovarian arteries [22, 23]. One {{of the major}} advantages of this method is that complications due to dispersal of occluding particles into {{other parts of the}} body can be avoided. Clipping or bipolar coagulation of <b>uterine</b> <b>arteries</b> and anastomotic sites can be performed under sight control. Further advantages of a laparascopic approach are that other causes of clinical symptoms such as pelvic pain may be diagnosed and treated simultaneously. Moreover, although malignancy of myoma is rare, in some cases malignancy has been overlooked in the course of embolotherapy [20]. During laparascopy, on the contrary, misdiagnosing can easily be avoided by taking biopsies if there are doubts about the dignity of fibroids.|$|R
