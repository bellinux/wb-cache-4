5|$|The agung {{is usually}} {{performed}} while {{standing beside the}} instrument, holding the <b>upper</b> <b>edge</b> of its flange between the thumb and other fingers with the left hand while striking the knob with the right hand. The mallets, called balu, are made from short sticks about half a foot in length and padded with soft but tough material such as rubber at one end. Using these balus, players handle the agung {{similar to the way}} a brass tom-tom is played.|$|E
5|$|At higher elevations, {{mountain}} hemlock and subalpine fir are {{the most}} common trees. Alaska cedar and whitebark pine are also present. However, as the elevation increases, the forest becomes increasingly fragmented, and is interspersed with meadows consisting of grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Scree slopes are also common. Temperatures can vary greatly within one day due to the high altitude of the habitat and lack of forest cover. For the same reasons, the parkland also experiences increased solar radiation. At the <b>upper</b> <b>edge</b> of the parkland, trees tend to be stunted, and grow in small clumps. Common shrubs include heather and mountain huckleberry. Off-trail hiking can be very destructive in the sub-alpine zone.|$|E
5|$|The blackmouth {{catshark}} (Galeus melastomus) is {{a species of}} catshark, {{and part of the}} family Scyliorhinidae, common in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from Iceland to Senegal, including the Mediterranean Sea. It is typically found over the continental slope at depths of , on or near muddy bottoms. The youngest sharks generally inhabit shallower water than the older juveniles and adults. This slim-bodied species is characterized by the black interior of its mouth, a marbled pattern of pale-edged brownish saddles or blotches along its back and tail, and a prominent saw-toothed crest of enlarged dermal denticles along the <b>upper</b> <b>edge</b> of its caudal fin. It reaches lengths of , with sharks in the Atlantic growing larger than those in the Mediterranean.|$|E
30|$|A typical first {{example of}} an <b>upper</b> <b>edges</b> {{continuous}} mapping is the <b>upper</b> <b>edges</b> contraction on the <b>upper</b> <b>edges</b> transversal space (X, ρ). For further facts on the <b>upper</b> <b>edges</b> continuous mappings, see Tasković [6].|$|R
30|$|An <b>upper</b> <b>edges</b> {{transversal}} space (or <b>upper</b> <b>edges</b> space) {{is a set}} X {{together with}} a given <b>upper</b> <b>edges</b> transverse on X. The function ψ: [a,b]^ 2 →[a,b] in (A) is called an upper bisection function.|$|R

5|$|Unable to {{maneuver}} the Soyuz to dock with the station, Stone ejects herself via explosive decompression {{and uses a}} fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to travel the final metres to Tiangong, which is rapidly deorbiting. Stone then enters the Shenzhou capsule just as Tiangong starts to break up on the <b>upper</b> <b>edge</b> of the atmosphere. Stone radios that she is ready {{to head back to}} Earth. After re-entering the atmosphere, Stone hears Mission Control, which is tracking the capsule and sending a rescue. But due to a harsh reentry and the premature jettison of the heat shield, a fire starts inside the capsule.|$|E
5|$|The beak is very distinctive. From {{the side}} the beak is broad and {{triangular}} but viewed from above it is narrow. The half nearest the tip is orange-red and the half nearest {{to the head}} is slate grey. There is a yellow chevron-shaped ridge separating the two parts and a yellow, fleshy strip {{at the base of}} the bill. At the joint of the two mandibles there is a yellow, wrinkled rosette. The exact proportions of the beak vary with the age of the bird. In an immature individual, the beak has reached its full length but it is not as broad as that of an adult. With time the bill deepens, the <b>upper</b> <b>edge</b> curves and a kink develops at its base. As the bird ages, one or more grooves may form on the red portion. The bird has a powerful bite.|$|E
5|$|The two dorsal fins {{are roughly}} equal {{in size and}} placed far back on the body: the first {{originates}} behind {{the midpoint of the}} pelvic fin bases and the second behind the midpoint of the anal fin base. The pectoral fins are large, while the pelvic fins are small and low, with angular margins. The anal fin is much larger than either dorsal fin; its base measures 13–18% of the total length and greatly exceeds the distance between the pelvic and anal fins, or between the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle is laterally compressed, {{with the end of the}} anal fin very close to the caudal fin. The caudal fin comprises around a quarter of the total length; the upper lobe is low with a ventral notch near the tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is very thick and covered by well-calcified dermal denticles. There is a prominent row of enlarged denticles, resembling saw teeth, along the <b>upper</b> <b>edge</b> of the caudal fin. The body is grayish-brown above, with 15–18 dark, rounded saddles, blotches, and/or spots that run onto the tail; each marking is highlighted by a paler border. The underside is white, as are the tips of the dorsal and caudal fins. The inside of the mouth is black.|$|E
30|$|T-space {{is a pair}} (X,ρ), where X is a {{transversal}} <b>upper</b> <b>edges</b> space and where the <b>upper</b> (<b>edges)</b> transverse ρ[u,v]=M_u,v(x) satisfies M_u,v=M_v,u, M_u,v(c)=b for some c∈R and (Eq).|$|R
30|$|A {{fundamental}} third {{example of}} a transversal <b>upper</b> <b>edges</b> space is a transversal <b>upper</b> <b>edges</b> r-space for r> 1. Indeed, in 1998 this space {{was known as a}} transversal upper space. For ψ(s,t):=rs+rt (r> 1), we obtain directly in this case the transversal <b>upper</b> <b>edges</b> r-space. This space is well known for r> 1 as an r-metric space (or as almost metric space) introduced in 1989 by Bakhtin [14]. Also see Czerwik [15].|$|R
30|$|Next, {{the concept}} of a {{neighborhood}} can be introduced and defined with the aid of the <b>upper</b> <b>edges</b> transverse.
