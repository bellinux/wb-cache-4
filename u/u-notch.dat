40|$|AbstractA brittle {{fracture}} criterion is proposed for predicting fracture toughness of U-shaped notches under pure mode II loading.

The UMTS criterion can be generally used for determining the mode II fracture toughness of <b>U-notched</b> components {{as well as the}} fracture initiation angle in U-shaped notches under pure mode II loading. To verify the validity of the proposed criterion, a set of experiments were carried out on the <b>U-notched</b> Brazilian disc (UNBD) specimens made of PMMA and also soda-lime glass.

To a certain extent, it is a generalisation of Glinka's NSIF for mode I, where sigma(tip) is replaced by sigma(max).

50|$|Open sights {{generally}} are used where the rear sight is at significant {{distance from the}} shooter's eye. They provide minimum occlusion of the shooter's view, but {{at the expense of}} precision. Open sights generally use either a square post or a bead on a post for a front sight. To use the sight, the post or bead is positioned both vertically and horizontally {{in the center of the}} rear sight notch. For a center hold, the front sight is positioned on the center of the target, bisecting the target vertically and horizontally. For a 6'oclock hold, the front sight is positioned just below the target and centered horizontally. A 6'oclock hold is only good for a known target size at a known distance and will not hold zero without user adjustment if these factors are varied. From the shooter's point of view, there should be a noticeable space between each side of the front sight and the edges of the notch; the spaces are called light bars, and the brightness of the light bars provides the shooter feedback as to the alignment of the post in the notch. Vertical alignment is done by lining up the top of the front post with the top of the rear sight, or by placing the bead just above the bottom of the V or <b>U-notch.</b> If the post is not centered in the V or U notch, the shot will not be accurate. If the post extends over the V or <b>U-notch</b> it will result in a high shot. If the post does not reach the top of the V or <b>U-notch</b> it will result in a low shot.|$|E

The common feature of these two notched specimens was that cracks were seen to initiate, within the material, away from the stress raisers, even though obvious stress concentrations existed at notch tip. The performed validation exercise confirms the accuracy and reliability of the linear-elastic TCD in estimating the fracture initiation position and static strength of standard notched round bars and double-side <b>U-notched</b> flat plate specimens.

Some small holes used to detecting pressure were arranged on a sleeve that can be shifted and rotated in preset locations.

The effect of this {{test apparatus}} on the flow field inside the valve is limited to the minimum to improve the accuracy of the method proposed. The experimental results of pressure distribution are agreed well with the CFD results as a whole, particularly in diverging flow direction in notch (called ‘FLOW-OUT’).

U notches were introduced through broaching, and hardness traces and optical microscopy on cross-sections through the U notch broaching showed that the broaching process had introduced a deformed, work hardened layer. Fatigue tests were conducted under load control using a 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 trapezoidal waveform, on specimens with as-broached and polished U-notches. Multi-site crack initiation occurred in the notch root. Many of the cracks initiated at bulge-like features formed by volume expansion of oxidising (Nb,Ti) C particles. In unstressed samples, oxidation of (Nb,Ti) C particles occurred readily, producing characteristic surface eruptions. Scanning electron microscopy on metallographic sections revealed some sub-surface (Nb,Ti) C oxidation and localised matrix deformation around oxidised particles. A mechanism for crack initiation by carbide expansion during oxidation is discussed.
