50|$|The disease {{cycle of}} Puccinia schedonardii does not vary from other rust disease cycles. This {{pathogen}} is heteroecious and exhibits a polycyclic disease cycle. Puccinia schedonnardii overwinters as teliospores that are produced in telia on the alternate host. In the spring, the teliospores germinate to produce basidiospores. The basidospores are then windblown to the cotton host where they enter via stomata. When basidiospores germinate, they produce a mycelium from which flask-shape pycnia {{as well as}} receptive hyphae are formed. From here, nothing happens until the pycniospores produced by the pycnia fertilize receptive hyphae of a different mating type. Over a period of five to ten days the dikaryotic mycelia formed by the joining of the receptive hyphae and the pycniospore grows through the cotton leaf to produce aecia. Aecia are the pustules seen on {{the leaves of the}} cotton. When conditions are right, and adequate moisture is achieved, aeciospores are released from the aecia. These aeciospores land on the alternate grass host and infect it via a germ tube. Eventually, a <b>uredium</b> is formed from this germ tube. The uredospores released by the <b>uredium</b> are then able to do one of two things. As a polycyclic disease, the uredospores present an opportunity for secondary infection in a single season. The spores can either reinfect grasses by spreading uredospores that become uredia which leads to more uredospores and a likely epidemic; or they can become overwintering teliospores, thus preparing for the cycle to begin again in the spring.|$|E
40|$|Several oat cultivars (Avena sp.) were inoculated on the lst, 2 nd and 4 th {{leaves with}} race 264 of P, coronata f. sp. avenae to {{characterize}} and determine components of partial resistance (slow rusting). Panfive {{was the only}} cultivar to exhibit partial resistance. It gave a moderately susceptible reaction but expressed a lower infection efficiency, fewer and smaller uredia, and a lower spore production compared to the susceptible cultivars Algerian and Sual for all three leaf ages tested. In the field this cultivar has consistently shown partial resistance. Garry, a cultivar reported to be slow rusting but highly susceptible {{in the field in}} Queensland, expressed a significantly lower infection efficiency and <b>uredium</b> density than Algerian and Sual on the first leaf. Older leaves of Garry, however, did not show a significant reduction in the components of partial resistance when compared to Algerian and Sual. Results suggested that <b>uredium</b> density gave the best indication of partial resistance across the three leaf ages tested for Panfive. A significant difference was present between <b>uredium</b> densities on upper and lower surfaces of the 4 th leaf only for the susceptible and partially resistant cultivars. In general, the resistance of all cultivars tended to increase with an increase in leaf age...|$|E
40|$|New {{disease of}} {{bunching}} onion (Allium fistulosum) with typical symptoms as rust disease {{was found in}} the sub-district of West Tompaso and Modoinding, District of South Minahasa, North Sulawesi in June 2016. Infected plants in the field showed yellowish brown pustules on leaf surface, followed by leaf yellowing and drying out started from the tip. Disease incidence in surveyed area reached 100 % with disease severity between 30 %– 50 %. Based on microscopic observation of the fungal morphological characteristic, i. e. <b>uredium</b> dan urediniospora, the causal agent was identified as Puccinia allii Rud. </p...|$|E
40|$|Efficacy of Verticillium lecanii {{to prevent}} the {{incidence}} of rust on coffee leaf disks in the laboratory.   In the coffee plantations, Verticillium colonies often develop on the <b>uredium</b> and urediospores of H. vastatrix causing coffee leaf rust.   The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the efficacy of V. lecanii to prevent disease incidence on coffee leaf disks in the laboratory.   Leaf samples showing lesions with H. vastatrix uredospores and whitish mycelium expected to be Verticillium were taken from two coffee fields at Sumberjaya Subdistrict, West Lampung, and transported in ice chest to the laboratory.   Verticillium was isolated with a sterilized needle and grown on PDA-lactic acid media (PDA-L).   Verticillium was identified as V. lecanii as reported previously.   In the first test, each of two isolates of V. lecanii was grown on media containing yeast extract, malt, peptone-water, and dexytrose (YMPD) to produce conidia.   In the second and third tests, each of five antagonistic isolates was grown on PDA-L.    Suspension with 107 conidia ml- 1 was sprayed into leaf disks and then the disks were inoculated with urediospores (104 ml- 1).   In the first test, disease incidence was significantly reduced.   However, in the second and third tests, the disease was not significantly reduced...|$|E
