60|$|So, what I mean to say, {{although}} the providence which watches over good men {{saw to it}} that I was enabled to complete the homeward journey unscathed except in the billowy portions, removing from my path all goats, elephants, and even owls that looked like my Aunt Agatha, it was a frowning and jaundiced Bertram who finally came to anchor at the Brinkley Court front door. And when I saw a dark figure emerging from the porch to meet me, I prepared to let myself go and <b>uncork</b> all that was fizzing in the mind.|$|E

I could spot what he was thinking as clearly as if he had confided it to my personal ear. He wanted to sit down and call it a day, I mean, but the thought that gave him pause was that, if he did, he must then either <b>uncork</b> Gussie or take the Fink-Nottle speech as read and get straight on to the actual prize-giving.|$|E

60|$|Despite {{this fine}} practice, however, {{he was the}} shyest of mankind in the {{presence}} of women, and this shyness grew upon him with the years. Was it because he never tried to <b>uncork</b> himself? Oh, no! It was about this time that he, one day, put his arm round Clara, the servant--not passionately, but with deliberation, as if he were making an experiment with machinery. He then listened, as if to hear Clara ticking. He wrote an admirable love-letter--warm, dignified, sincere--to nobody in particular, and carried it about in his pocket in readiness. But in love-making, as in the other arts, those do it best who cannot tell how it is done; and he was always stricken with a palsy when about to present that letter. It seemed that he was only able to speak to ladies when they were not there. Well, if he could not speak, he thought the more; he thought so profoundly that in time the heroines of Pym ceased to thrill him.|$|E
60|$|Now, don't you in {{your own}} heart and soul quarrel with me for this long silence? Not half so much as I quarrel with myself, I know; but if you could read half the letters I write to you in imagination, you would swear by me for the best of correspondents. The truth is, that when I have done my morning's work, down goes my pen, and from that minute I feel it a {{positive}} impossibility to take it up again, until imaginary butchers and bakers wave me to my desk. I walk about brimful of letters, facetious descriptions, touching morsels, and pathetic friendships, but can't {{for the soul of}} me <b>uncork</b> myself. The post-office is my rock ahead. My average number of letters that must be written every day is, at the least, a dozen. And you could no more know what I was writing to you spiritually, from the perusal of the bodily thirteenth, than you could tell from my hat {{what was going on in}} my head, or could read my heart on the surface of my flannel waistcoat.|$|E
6000|$|When old Mr. Scott was {{informed}} what had happened, {{he put down}} his newspaper, took off his spectacles, and smiled a strange, wide smile.

And then he can <b>uncork</b> it, and out will come all you have said in your very words and voice, with the sniffles and sneezes that might have got in accidental. So that {{if one of the}} Old Testament Egyptians that they've been diggin' up lately had had one of these boxes with him it might have been uncorked and people could have heard in his own voice just who he was and what was his personal opinion of Moses and his brother Aaron. Now, when an old man like me has just come to know of a thing of this kind, it isn't for him to have a word to say when he is told that Lilian Budworth is to be his step-grandmother; he must take it in along with the other wonders." ...|$|E

60|$|He made tracks heavily, {{slowly with}} a dumpy {{sort of a}} gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there {{was out of the}} shelter and bore due left. While he was in the act of getting his {{bearings}} Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship's rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and <b>uncork</b> it or unscrew and, applying its nozz1e to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction {{in the shape of a}} female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool 100 pounds a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver. He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if--a big if, however--he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.|$|E

5000|$|The 1972 Miami Dolphins {{became the}} only NFL team to have a perfect winning season, capped by winning Super Bowl VII. It is a well-travelled urban legend that each year the {{surviving}} {{members of the team}} had made a ritual of getting together and drinking champagne when the last unbeaten team loses. In actuality, only a small group of ex-players - namely Bob Griese, Nick Buoniconti and Dick Anderson, who all live in Coral Gables, Florida - gathered to <b>uncork</b> the champagne and have a celebratory drink. The Dolphins never made the now traditional post-game Super Bowl champion visit to the White House during the Watergate scandal in the administration of President Richard Nixon. MSNBC reported that this was a deliberate snub by Nixon, who was a fan of the Washington Redskins, who lost Super Bowl VII to the Dolphins. But finally on August 20, 2013, four decades after their accomplishment, Barack Obama hosted the team, noting that they [...] "never got their White House visit".|$|E
