40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} and characterization of improved fire-retardant ethylene-acrylate foams. A commercial formulation, usually employed in the cable industry sector, Casico, was modified using two different synergistic flame retardant (FR) systems: silica/zinc borate micro-sized particles (M) and montmorillonite/graphene nanoplatelets (N). The different composites were prepared by melt-blending and the foams by a compression-molding chemical foaming process (Casico-based foams). All Casico-based foams presented a mainly closed-cell structure. The presence of the nanoparticles system (N) promoted the formation of microcellular foams, with cell sizes lower than 100 µm, and narrow cell distributions. Nevertheless, when both flame retardant systems were added a higher cell collapse was noticed. Due to the foam's Casico-N structure {{and the presence of}} the stiff layered nanoparticles an increase of the temperature of ß and a relaxations and specific loss modulus was registered for that foam respect to the Casico foam. In a general way, the Casico-based foams presented a thermal decomposition behavior similar to that of <b>unfoamed</b> Casico. Only a slight increase of the thermal stability of the step associated to the ionomer decomposition was observed respect to the Casico. Significant fire behavior improvements were observed for Casico-M-N foam.

Strength properties of wood particle composites made with foamed adhesive were found to be equivalent to those with adhesive applied as a spray. Applying foamed adhesive was superior to mixing particles with <b>unfoamed</b> adhesive. Strength properties were not correlated to adhesive distribution according to particle size.

40|$|International audiencePolystyrene (PS) foams with {{isotropy}} {{cell morphology}} and oriented cell morphology {{were prepared to}} investigate {{the relationship between the}} cell morphologies and the mechanical properties (tensile and impact properties). For the isotropy cell morphologies, the tensile strength, tensile modulus and impact strength of PS foams all increase with the increase of relative density. When the relative density is constant, the cell size does not affect the tensile strength and modulus but has a modest effect on the impact strength. The solid area (cell walls) fraction on the fracture-surface and the cell walls finely dispersed by the bubbles are the main reasons for the toughening of isotropy PS foams. For oriented foams, the cell morphologies oriented perpendicular to the impact direction could significantly enhance the toughness of PS foams. The oriented bubbles and the matrix perpendicular to the fracture propagation direction are expected to absorbed large impact energy during the fracture process and make sample more ductile. The impact strength of the highly oriented PS foam in this work is about 1. 5 times that of the <b>unfoamed</b> one while its relative density is 0. 3. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements indicate that the molecular chains can be oriented by the shearing of the bubbles by oriented foaming, which leads to the improvement of tensile strength along oriented direction.

40|$|In this work, {{blend of}} starch and poly-e-caprolactone (PCL) doped with {{different}} concentrations of 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate ([BMIM]Ac) or 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl) was studied. The blends {{were characterized by}} mechanical analysis, infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS), evaluating the IL doping effect. The samples were submitted to supercritical carbon dioxide foaming and the morphology of the structures was assessed. DSC shows a single glass transition and melting endotherm for foamed and <b>unfoamed</b> samples, undergoing no effect upon IL doping, and DRS shows increased molecular mobility for blends with higher IL concentrations, and some hindrance for lower ones. Conductivity for SPCL doped with 30 % [BMIM]Cl, before and after foaming, is comparable to conductivity of the IL but exhibiting more stable conductivity values, opening doors for applications as self-supported conductive materials.

40|$|A {{binder system}} {{containing}} polyurethane precursors {{was used to}} in situ foam (direct foam) a (La{sub 0. 6 }Sr{sub 0. 4 }) {sub 0. 98 } (Co{sub 0. 2 } Fe{sub 0. 8 }) O{sub 3 -{delta}} (LSCF) cathode composition upon a yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte coated with a porous # 3; 10 mm thick cathode active layer. The YSZ electrolyte was # 3; 110 mm in thickness, and a full cell was created by application of a Ni/(Ce{sub 0. 9 }Gd{sub 0. 1 }) O{sub 2 } cermet as the baseline anode. Cells possessing the foamed LSCF cathode were compared to cells constructed via standard methods in terms of resultant microstructure, electrochemical performance, and introceptive character. The foamed cathode tended to possess {{a high level of}} tortuous porosity which was ellipsoidal and interconnected in character. Both the standard and foamed cathode structures were subjected to an infiltration process, and the resultant microstructure was examined. The impregnation efficiency of the foamed cathode was at least # 3; 10 % greater per deposition than that of an <b>unfoamed</b> porous LSCF cathode. The SOFC with the Pt nano-catalyst impregnated foamed cathode demonstrated a maximum power density of 593 mW/cm{sup 2 } utilizing wet H{sub 2 } fuel, which is 52 % higher than a SOFC with the baseline Pt-impregnated LSCF cathode (# 3; 390 mW/cm{sup 2 }) at 800 {degrees}C. The cathode compositional and microstructural alterations obtainable by foaming led to the elevated power performance, which was shown to be quite high relative to standard SOFCs with a thick YSZ electrolyte...|$|E
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{the application of}} High Power Ultrasonic Microembossing Technology (HPUMT) in producing microfeatures on polymer substrates. The work reviews a novel method of obtaining flash free and precise microfeatures by manipulating the material density through microcellular foaming. The microfeatures created on the polymer substrates were further characterized by analyzing the feature depth {{with respect to the}} critical ultrasonic embossing operating parameters such as embossing heating times (s), embossing amplitude (ym) at a constant embossing trigger force (N). An experiment design was constructed and performed to characterize the parameters on foamed and <b>unfoamed</b> (or regular) versions of polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP) sample materials. Results indicated feature depth was proportional to heating times, amplitude and force. It was also seen the maximum depth was achieved in the shortest cycle times with higher amplitudes and forces of operation. HPUMT was further studied to create functional network of microchannels functioned as reservoirs, reaction chamber and burst or gate valves to form a centrifugal biosensing platform that is also referred to as a lab-on-CD or a bio-CD device. The surface energy of the polymer substrates was increased to enable fluid flow by using a surfactant based organic coating to facilitate hydrophilicity. Using an organic light emitting diode (OLEDs) as an electroluminescence source provided luminescence decay results in good agreement with stern-volmer relationship. The functionality of the OLED-coupled lab-on-CD device was further tested in measuring unknown concentrations of a particular analyte in corn slurry sample which contained numerous contaminants. Combinatorial multianalyte sensing was also made possible on a single bio-CD using a four photodetector (PD) quad preamp disk sensor...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Physical properties and morphology of extruded semicrystalline polymers can be significantly affected by modification and change in die design and melt viscosity of the molten polymer. Further modifications to physical properties (i. e. density and open cell fraction) of foamed material occur, following the modification of melt viscosity by melt blending of polypropylene and high density polyethylene). The main object of this research project was {{to carry out a}} systematic examination of rheological properties of polymer/gas mixture, affect of die design, polymer molecular weight (melt viscosity), and processing conditions on density, open cell fraction, cell morphology (i. e. cell size and cell size distribution) and micromorphology of polyolefin foams. Also attention was given to method of stabilisation of extruded foam, where, it was found support of the extrudated foam (by adding a specially designed die adapter {{to the end of the}} die) prior to entering the cooling tank could result not only to a specimen with uniform cross section, but also due to drop in melt temperature, the cell walls are to some extent rigidized, hence, the collapse of bubbles are limited. From commercial point of view control of cell collapse, density and open cell fraction, will make these foamed materials valuable for their filtration characteristics. Microstructural analysis of polypropylene (<b>unfoamed</b> state) by X-ray diffraction and Differential Scanning Calorimetry revealed 13 -spherulites are only formed in skin layer, and beneath the thickness of 500 pm from the surface, the crystal structure of this polymer is only consist of B-spherulites. On the other hand, the chemical blowing agent (Hydrocerol CF- 20), was found to have nucleating affect on microstructure of polypropylene, where, it has resulted in reduction of size of spherulites together with a drop in recrystallisation temperature and formation of P and a spherulites through the thickness of extrudated foam. The foregoing chemical blowing agent was found to have no significant affect on the crystal structure of the high density polyethylene...|$|E
