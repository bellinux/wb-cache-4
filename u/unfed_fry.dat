40|$|Recruitment {{failure of}} lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in the Great Lakes has been {{attributed}} {{in part to}} the consumption of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) by adult lake trout, leading to Thiamine Deficiency Complex (TDC) and early mortality in fry. The current understanding of thiamine deficiency in lake trout fry is based on information from culture and hatchery settings, which do not represent conditions fry experience in the wild and may influence the occurrence of TDC. In the wild, lake trout fry have access to zooplankton immediately following hatching; previous studies found that wild fry begin feeding before complete yolk-sac absorption. However, hatchery-raised fry are not provided with food until after yolk-sac absorption, long after the development of TDC. Zooplankton are a potential source of dietary thiamine for wild fry in the early life stages that has not previously been considered in the occurrence of thiamine deficiency. We postulated that wild-hatched fry could mitigate thiamine deficiency through early feeding on natural prey. Specifically, we hypothesized 1) feeding should increase thiamine concentrations relative to <b>unfed</b> <b>fry</b> and 2) feeding should increase survival relative to <b>unfed</b> <b>fry.</b> Feeding experiments were conducted on lake trout fry reared from eggs collected from Lake Champlain in 2014 and Cayuga Lake in 2015. A fully crossed experimental design was used to determine the effect of early feeding by lake trout fry in thiamine replete and thiamine deplete treatments before and after feeding. Overall, thiamine concentrations and survival did not significantly differ between fed and <b>unfed</b> <b>fry.</b> Thiamine concentrations increased from egg stage to hatching in both years, suggesting a potential source of thiamine, which had not previously been considered, was available to the lake trout eggs during development...|$|E
40|$|All {{species of}} fish are able to {{propagate}} and maintain their numbers provided that no adverse influence occurs to change the compatible environment, the salmon is no exception. Propagation of fish by artificial means {{has long been a}} subject of discussion amongst fishery workers and views have been expressed (both favourable and unfavourable) on the merits of the various methods employed. In an attempt to discover whether artificial propagation was necessary and also to find the best methods of propagation to adopt in the various rivers, a phased programme of investigation into natural spawning efficiency and the results obtained by various methods of artificial propagation was started in the Lancashire River Board area during 1957. The object being to seek information on: (1) The survival of ova from natural spawnings to the eyed and alevin stages. (2) The population density of feeding fry (from natural spawnings) at various intervals of development. (3) The viability of green ova and eyed ova- when planted artificially. (4 a) The survival to 0 + parr from implants of eyed ova <b>unfed</b> <b>fry</b> and fed fry. (4 b) Populations per unit area of 0 + parr from various planting densities of eyed ova, <b>unfed</b> <b>fry</b> and fed fry. Sampling stations were selected on the Rivers Ribble, Lune and Wyre watersheds for the purpose of marking and examination of natural salmon redds...|$|E

(2013) : Umpqua Coho Salmon Genetic Pedigree. Oregon State University Libraries. Dataset. doi: 10. 7267 /N 9 H 41 PB 9. "Data, pedigrees, {{reports and}} manuscripts herein are from an {{investigation}} conducted with coho salmon of the Umpqua River in southern Oregon from 2001 - 2009. They relate {{to a study}} investigating several areas of uncertainty {{about the use of}} salmon hatcheries to increase the abundance of wild populations. At that time, there was considerable interest in using hatcheries to speed the recovery of wild populations. However the value of such an approach was untested. Substantial literature indicated that hatchery programs may pose high risks to wild populations, rather than aid them (see the following reviews: Hindar et al 1991, Waples 1991, Waples 1999, and Lichatowich 1999 and literature cited therein). If these risks were real, hatcheries may interfere with recovery, rather than speed it up. Until the early 2000 s, analytical methods to explore the critical questions and risks associated with hatchery programs were unavailable because {{we were not able to}} track lineages in streams once hatchery and wild fish were allowed to spawn together. New molecular genetics methods, however, allowed the use of DNA fingerprints to pedigree entire populations under some circumstances and develop lineages that continue for multiple generations under natural spawning conditions. The objective of the study was to conduct an experimental supplementation project for coho salmon in Calapooya Creek, a tributary of the Umpqua River, using the following hatchery scenarios: a. Rock Creek hatchery stock released as smolts (a “conventional hatchery program”); b. Rock Creek hatchery stock released as <b>unfed</b> <b>fry</b> (a low- intervention hatchery program); c. First-generation wild-type hatchery stock released as smolts; and d. First-generation wild-type hatchery stock released as <b>unfed</b> <b>fry...</b>|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{performances}} of newly-established gravel incubation systems designed to use unfiltered water for production of <b>unfed</b> salmon <b>fry</b> were evaluated at Netarts Bay, Oregon, and at Little Port Walter, Alaska. Research {{was divided into}} two phases. The first consisted of laboratory studies to develop fry quality testing procedures and to concurrently investigate effects of substrate, stocking density, water velocity, exposure to light, and incubator design on fry quality. The second consisted of field comparisons of gravel incubator fry to parent stock wild fry at the two sites. Fry quality criteria included egg and alevin mortality, frequency of physical abnormalities, migration pattern and timing, post-emergence growth, size and stage of development, and performance in stress tests; size was the primary criterion. Chum salmon incubated without substrate support and exposed periodically to light experienced intense photonegative reaction leading to yolk-sac malformation, high mortality, and loss of fry size; provision of a shallow gravel substrate negated these adverse effects. By comparison, chinook salmon treated similarly experienced milder photonegative reaction arid insignificant mortalities and yolk-sac malformation; fry size and post-emergence growth appeared to be unaffected by substrate rugosity. Apparent water velocities of 50 to 100 cm/hr and stocking densities of 1. 29 to 2. 58 pink salmon eggs/cm² produced equivalent fry size without accelerated developmental rates. Increasing velocity to 300 cm/hr or density to 5. 16 pink salmon eggs/cm² accelerated developmental rates without affecting fry size. The influence was more significant for velocity (p<O. 025) than for density (p<O. 10). Incubator design or substrate rugosity and depth had little influence on relative fry size of chum salmon given favorable conditions of low stocking density and darkness; gravel incubator fry, however, performed better in stress tests than fry incubated on a smooth substrate. Deep and shallow matrix gravel incubator designs at Little Port Walter and two types of shallow matrix gravel incubator designs at Netarts Bay produced fry of at least equivalent size to wild fry; the deep gravel incubator tested at Little Port Walter was stocked at 0. 23 eggs/cm³, which is up to nine times higher than stocking densities used in similar systems elsewhere. At Little Port Walter, hatchery fry migrated at a stage of development similar to wild fry, but at Netarts Bay, hatchery fry migrated mostly at less mature developmental stages than wild fry. Although no difference in size was detected between fry incubated in shallow matrix or deep matrix gravel incubators in laboratory or field studies, judgments on the preferred system must await evaluation at the adult stage...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Relative {{growth and}} {{survival}} of offspring from matings of hatchery and wild Deschutes River (Oregon) summer steelhead trout, Salmo gairdneri, were monitored to determine if hatchery fish differ genetically from wild fish in traits which can affect the stock-recruitment relationship of wild populations. Four natural streams and a hatchery pond were each stocked with genetically marked eyed-eggs or <b>unfed</b> <b>fry</b> from each of three matings: hatchery x hatchery (HH), hatchery x wild (HW) and wild x wild (WW). In the hatchery pond, HH fish exhibited the greatest survival and were larger than fish in the other groups. WW fish had the greatest survival and HW fish were largest in streams where {{there were significant differences}} in survival or length. The hatchery fish were genetically different from wild fish and can have an adverse effect on the stock-recruitment relationship of the wild population when they interbreed with wild fish. Hatchery procedures can be modified to lessen this effect by minimizing the genetic differences between hatchery and wild fish...|$|E
40|$|Captive rearing often {{alters the}} phenotypes of organisms that are destined for release into the wild. Natural {{selection}} on these unnatural phenotypes could have important {{consequences for the}} utility of captive rearing as a restoration approach. We show that normal hatchery practices significantly advance the development of endangered Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fry by 30 + days. As a result, hatchery fry {{might be expected to}} face strong natural selection resulting from their developmental asynchrony. We investigated patterns of ontogenetic selection acting on hatchery produced salmon fry by experimentally manipulating fry development stage at stocking. Contrary to simple predictions, we found evidence for strong stabilizing selection on the ontogeny of unfed hatchery fry, with weaker evidence for positive directional selection on the ontogeny of fed fry. These selection patterns suggest a seasonally independent tradeoff between abiotic or biotic selection favoring advanced development and physiological selection linked to risk of starvation in <b>unfed</b> <b>fry.</b> We show, through a heuristic exercise, how such selection on ontogeny may exacerbate problems in restoration efforts by impairing fry productivity and reducing effective population sizes by 13 – 81 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{decline of}} anadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) populations makes it imperative {{to research the}} underlying cause and to develop mitigation measures. One of the most vulnerable phases in the life-cycle of salmon is the fry stage in early spring. Survival rates of juveniles emerging from the gravel of riverbeds {{are related to the}} three-dimensional complexity of bottom morphology and hence the variety of microhabitats within the nursery area. However, anthropogenically increased sediment supply due to changes in agricultural land-use reduces complexity, especially the roughness of the streambed. This study used a series of controlled manipulative field experiments conducted in a purpose built raceway system, to provide quantitative data on the impact of sediment pollution on salmon production in freshwaters. The comparison of in-stream habitat with an increased sediment load and control (i. e. simulated natural) situations revealed that increased sedimentation drastically reduced the salmon fry carrying capacity of a stream. A modest increase in sand bed load (15 %) in semi-natural streams reduced the fry density by 50 % ten days after stocking with <b>unfed</b> <b>fry.</b> Emigration patterns of fry from sedimented habitat and control habitat were significantly different. Fry from both habitat types showed unusual active upstream migration which compensated for densities exceeding the carrying capacity. Riverine habitat was optimised on a reach scale to complement the raceway results and to provide a temporary mitigation measure. The in-stream habitat of a mill leat was manipulated to build the first Eco-Hatchery for salmon in the UK based, on results from the raceway and on an extensive literature review. The hatchery achieved high survival rates of salmon juveniles throughout their freshwater life stages. Furthermore, in-stream sediment traps were developed to offer effective protection for key fry nursery habitat from excess sand bed load. The data provided by the raceway system and the Eco-Hatchery inform riparian management plans. However, addressing sedimentation related issues in salmon rivers is a politically sensitive issue and will take time. Stocking with <b>unfed</b> <b>fry</b> is being used in the interim to temporarily enhance or restore populations. But stocking programmes based on conventional hatchery methodology as a response to declining stocks have frequently failed in both respects. A semi-natural incubator for salmon eggs, the Bamberger-box, was developed to address extremely low survival of newly stocked fry from conventional hatcheries. The new incubator mimics a natural salmon redd and aims in essence to produce wild fish in a hatchery environment. The results of five years field experiments using genetically different broodstock were encouraging. There was {{a significant increase in the}} average length and body mass of fry emerging from Bamberger-boxes and the mean eyed-egg-to-fry survival was 93 % - greatly exceeding published data for egg-to-fry survival in the wild. Fry from Bamberger-boxes showed a significantly different and more natural rheotactic behaviour, and fewer fry had deformities when compared with fry incubated in conventional hatchery troughs. Seasonal and diurnal emergence patterns from Bamberger-boxes correlated with natural emergence patterns. A potentially crucial advantage of this new semi-natural incubation system was to ensure larvae survival during environmental extremes when all juveniles incubated in conventional hatchery troughs did not survive. Large-scale commercial incubators based on the same principles as the Bamberger-Box were developed and proved equally effective in producing ecologically viable fry. Low costs of production and operation render the new incubators an economically viable alternative to traditional incubation systems. Exploratory research on the influence of hyporheic invertebrates abundance on fry size at emergence was carried out as a next step in continuously improving semi-natural incubation technology...|$|E
