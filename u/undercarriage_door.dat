50|$|The Arsenal VG 90 was a carrier-based fighter {{aircraft}} {{built in}} France in 1949, but {{which was not}} developed past the prototype stage. It was to compete against the SNCAC NC 1080 and Nord N.2200 for an Aéronavale contract, but both VG 90 prototypes were destroyed in fatal crashes early in the development programme. The first crash occurred on 25 May 1950, when an <b>undercarriage</b> <b>door</b> tore off in flight and struck the aircraft's tail. Pilot Pierre Decroo {{was killed in the}} crash. The second crash claimed the life of pilot Claude Dellys and took place on 21 February 1952 after the tail of the aircraft was torn off due to aerodynamic flutter. Dellys' ejection seat malfunctioned and did not fire. A third prototype, then under construction, was abandoned at this juncture.|$|E
25|$|The {{undercarriage}} mountings were redesigned and the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors</b> were bowed {{in cross}} section allowing the legs to sit lower in the wells, eliminating the upper-wing blisters over the wheel wells and landing gear pivot points.|$|R
50|$|Incorporating {{many of the}} {{improvements}} developed for the SA 366 G1 (HH-65 Dolphin), this version introduced upgraded 526 kW (705 shp) Arriel 1C1 turboshafts, an improved 11-blade Fenestron with wider-cord blades (which reduced the AS365 N1's noise signature), movable <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors</b> replaced by simplified fairings and a higher gross weight of 4100 kg.|$|R
5|$|In June 2010 diving {{operations}} {{were carried out}} and the survey report indicated that the aircraft was largely complete, although 5K+AR lay inverted on the seabed, indicating that it ground-looped on landing. The port rudder, starboard stabiliser, forward nose glazing, <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors</b> and engine cowling were missing, but {{the discovery of a}} small debris field associated with the wreck indicates that some or all of those parts may still be present at the site. Some items, including two of the Dornier's six MG 15 machine guns, are missing and are believed to have been stolen by unauthorized divers sometime after the aircraft's discovery.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a landing}} {{accident}} {{in which the}} retractable landing gear failed to extend, the P.111 was modified during its repairs to improve the flight characteristics, and was re-designated the P.111A. Four [...] "petal" [...] airbrakes {{were added to the}} fuselage to lower landing speeds and the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors</b> were changed to reduce the trim change. A long nose probe carrying a pitot head was added. The most immediately obvious change was the new bright yellow overall paint scheme, the P.111 having been unpainted or silver coloured. The P.111A soon gained the nickname of the [...] "Yellow Peril".|$|R
50|$|After initial {{production}} George Applebay {{announced the}} Zuni II, with improved control, performance and lighter structure, introducing Kevlar (aramid fibre/epoxy) main spars and carbon-fibre (Carbon-fibre/epoxy), in varying quantities as production continued, for wing structure and main <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors.</b> The Kelvar spar {{was built in}} cooperation with DuPont and saved over 70 lb in {{the weight of the}} aircraft compared to traditional fiberglass layups of the time. Other changes included a dihedral increase to 2o, tighter tolerances on the aileron control circuit, re-positioned mainwheel to improve ground handling, orthodox control stick to remove unwanted roll during high g manoeuvres, as well as a redesigned cockpit with forward opening canopy on parallel linkages.|$|R
40|$|Chord-wise {{openings}} in the skin between the spars of the wing are designed in some aircraft for <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors,</b> bomb bay doors, and the wing fold joints of naval Aircraft. Stress concentrations exist {{in the region of}} these cut-outs where the load is transferred from the stringers and skin into the concentrated load carrying members. Two theories have evolved to predict the resulting behaviour of the structure. The stringer sheet' theory predicts an infinite shear stress in the corners of the sheet; the 'finite stringer' theory predicts a high, finite shear stress in the corners, the magnitude of which increases with the number of stringers...|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} {{rolled out}} of Filton in mid-1938. Problems immediately arose with the Taurus engines continually overheating during ground testing. New, more conventional engine cowlings, with circumferential cooling gills had to be designed and installed, delaying the first flight which took place on 15 October 1938. As flight testing progressed {{it was found that}} the large apron-type <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors,</b> similar to those on the Blenheim, were causing the aircraft to yaw on landing. These doors were taken off for subsequent flights. On the second prototype and all production aircraft more conventional split doors, which left a small part of the tyres exposed when retracted, were used.|$|R
50|$|Various {{electrical}} faults {{disrupted the}} April 2008 test flights - on the 14th {{a trip to}} RAF Cottesmore resulted in the crew declaring an emergency and landing at Cottesmore believing the auxiliary power unit (APU) was on fire, only to find later {{it was simply a}} faulty warning light. Another flight two days later had to be ended because one of the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors</b> failed to close, found to be micro-switch malfunction. Major technical issues discovered {{during the first year of}} flight included difficulties with interfacing modern airport electrical systems with the Vulcan's electrical systems, and ingress of water into the airframe in wet weather.|$|R
2500|$|For this maiden flight, E0234, {{weighing}} , {{took off}} from the grass airstrip at the Hatfield site. The takeoff was reported as [...] "straightforward and easy" [...] and the undercarriage was not retracted until a considerable height was attained. The aircraft reached , with the only problem being the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors</b> – which were operated by bungee cords attached to the main undercarriage legs – that remained open by some [...] at that speed. This problem persisted for some time. The left wing of E0234 also {{had a tendency to}} drag to port slightly, so a rigging adjustment, i.e., a slight change in the angle of the wing, was carried out before further flights.|$|R
50|$|Beech 18s {{were used}} {{extensively}} by Air America during the Vietnam War; initially more-or-less standard ex-military C-45 examples were used, {{but then the}} airline had 12 aircraft modified by Conrad Conversions in 1963 and 1964 to increase performance and load-carrying capacity. The modified aircraft were known as Conrad Ten-Twos, as the maximhttps://www.utdallas.edu/library/specialcollections/hac/cataam/Leeker/aircraft/vtb.pdfum takeoff weight (MTOW) was increased to 10200 lb. The increase was achieved by several airframe modifications, including increased horizontal stabilizer angle-of-incidence, redesigned <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors,</b> and aerodynamically improved wingtips. Air America then had Volpar convert 14 aircraft to turboprop power, fitted with Garrett AiResearch TPE-331 engines; modified aircraft were called Volpar Turbo Beeches, and also had a further increase in MTOW to 10286 lb.|$|R
2500|$|The {{undercarriage}} mountings were redesigned and the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors</b> were bowed {{in cross}} section allowing the legs to sit lower in the wells, eliminating the upper-wing blisters over the wheel wells and landing gear pivot points. Stronger undercarriage legs were raked 2inches (5.08cm) forward, making the Spitfire more stable {{on the ground and}} reducing the likelihood of the aircraft tipping onto its nose. During production of the Mk VIII and Mk IX a new undercarriage leg was introduced which had external v-shaped [...] "scissor-links" [...] fitted {{to the front of the}} leg; this also led to small changes in the shape of the undercarriage bay and leg fairings. Because the Spitfire was no longer to be used as a night fighter, the retractable landing lights were no longer fitted.|$|R
50|$|Preparing the Vampire for {{take-off}} {{would only}} require pilots to perform six vital actions: setting the trim to neutral, opening {{the high and}} low-pressure fuel cocks, activating the booster pump, setting the flaps, and retracting the air brakes. If laden with external fuel tanks or bombs, pilots would have to retract the undercarriage quite quickly, else increasing airflow as the aircraft picked up speed would prevent the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors</b> from closing. Landing procedure was similarly free of complexity: disengaging the wheel brakes, lowering the undercarriage, setting the flaps to fully down, and effecting the air brakes. Typically, power-on landings were conducted due to the slow response of the engine to throttle changes, while the wheel brakes had to be applied carefully {{in order to avoid}} locking the wheels; there was no anti-lock braking system present.|$|R
5000|$|For this maiden flight, E0234, {{weighing}} 14150 lb, {{took off}} from a 450 ft field beside the shed it was built in. John E.

50|$|Colonel Johnnie Driscoll, {{head of the}} NATO Mutual Weapons Development Program noted Petter's light fighter concept. NATO was {{interested}} in ground-attack aircraft that could be operated from improvised airfields and could be manufactured by postwar European industry. Driscoll formalised a NATO requirement in August 1954 that would become the NATO light fighter competition. It was based on Petter's concept but included the requirement to use low-pressure tyres. However, the Gnat was designed to operate from concrete runways and used high-pressure tyres. Petter refused to modify the undercarriage because this would mean bulging the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors</b> and spoiling the Gnat's clean aerodynamic lines. Stanley Hooker urged him to 'Just say that you will try to do it, but Petter's moral code would not let him make false claims. As a result, the Gnat was eliminated from the competition in June 1955. Ironically, the Gnat trainer design would show that the wider tyres could be used without increasing drag.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} the [...] "universal wing" [...] the new design was {{standard}} on the majority of Spitfires built from mid 1942. This wing was structurally modified to reduce labour and manufacturing time and {{it was designed to}} allow mixed armament options: A type, B type, or four 20 mm Hispano cannon. The undercarriage mountings were redesigned and the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors</b> were bowed in cross section allowing the legs to sit lower in the wells, eliminating the upper-wing blisters over the wheel wells and landing gear pivot points. Stronger undercarriage legs were raked 2 inches (5.08 cm) forward, making the Spitfire more stable on the ground and reducing the likelihood of the aircraft tipping onto its nose.

Because the Spitfire was no longer to be used as a night fighter, the retractable landing lights were no longer fitted.|$|R
5000|$|The Universal wing {{also took}} into account {{the fact that the}} Hispano cannon had been {{converted}} to belt-feed, a move which allowed each cannon to carry double the ammunition load, or 120 rpg in ammunition trays instead of 60 rpg as in the original drum-fed cannon of the F.Mk Vb. This also eliminated the need for under- and over-wing blisters to accommodate the large-diameter ammunition drum, instead only requiring a small blister to cover the electrical [...] "Chattellerault" [...] feed mechanism.The undercarriage mountings were redesigned and the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors</b> were bowed in cross section allowing the legs to sit lower in the wells, eliminating the upper-wing blisters over the wheel wells and landing gear pivot points.The stronger undercarriage legs were angled 2 inches (5.08 cm) forward when extended, making the Spitfire more stable on the ground and reducing the likelihood of the aircraft tipping onto its nose. In addition the retractable landing lights were no longer fitted. Structural hard-points were added outboard of the wheel-wells, allowing racks to be fitted under each wing which were capable of carrying one 250 lb (113 kg) bomb each.|$|R
50|$|On 26 August 1940, 5K+AR {{was taking}} part in a raid by KG 2 and KG 3, {{targeting}} the RAF stations RAF Debden and RAF Hornchurch. While flying over clouds, the aircraft became separated from the bomber formation and lost its bearings; it was then attacked by Boulton Paul Defiant fighters of No. 264 Squadron RAF. One of the Dornier's engines was disabled and the other damaged, so the wounded pilot, Feldwebel (Flight Sergeant) Willi Effmert, elected to make a crash landing on the Goodwin Sands. He and another crew member survived and were taken prisoner. The other two crew were killed; one is buried at Cannock Chase German war cemetery and the other in the Netherlands. The identity of the Defiant that shot down the Dornier is not certain - it may have been one of three 264 Squadron aircraft that was shot down soon after in a battle with Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter escorts from Jagdgeschwader 3. In June 2010 diving operations were carried out and the survey report indicated that the aircraft was largely complete, although 5K+AR lay inverted on the seabed, indicating that it ground-looped on landing. The port rudder, starboard stabiliser, forward nose glazing, <b>undercarriage</b> <b>doors</b> and engine cowling were missing, but the discovery of a small debris field associated with the wreck indicates that some or all of those parts may still be present at the site. Some items, including two of the Dornier's six MG 15 machine guns, are missing and are believed to have been stolen by unauthorized divers sometime after the aircraft's discovery.|$|R
2500|$|The HPR.3 {{could carry}} up to 44 {{passengers}} in its pressurised cabin, {{which could be}} quickly converted to allow the carrying of freight, with the aircraft's high wing, nosewheel <b>undercarriage</b> and large <b>doors</b> at {{the front and rear}} of the cabin making the loading of cargo relatively simple. Large flaps were fitted to give good short takeoff and landing characteristics. It was designed to cruise at a speed of 224mph (360km/h), had a range of 1,640mi (2,640km), could land and take off in a distance of less than 500yards (460m) and [...] had an initial rate of climb of over 1,800ft/min.|$|R
