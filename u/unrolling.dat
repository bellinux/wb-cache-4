25|$|Proceedings {{start at}} around 3pm with the {{throwing}} of twelve Sack Hoods. These are rolled hessian sacks sewn up {{to prevent them}} <b>unrolling.</b> This is a prequel to the main game, mainly for children. The youngsters in the crowd run for them when thrown and attempt {{to get them off}} the field. If they are tackled then they must immediately throw it in the air unless the challenger is a Boggin in which case the hood is ‘boggined’ and it is returned to the Lord who starts it off again.|$|E
25|$|In the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, the {{cauldron}} {{resembled the}} end of a scroll that lifted out from the stadium rim and spiralled upwards. It was lit by Li Ning, a Chinese gymnast who was raised to the rim of the stadium by wires. He ran around the rim of the stadium while suspended and as he ran, an <b>unrolling</b> scroll was projected showing film clips of the flame's journey around the world. As he approached the cauldron, he lit an enormous wick, which then transferred the flame to the cauldron. The flame then spiralled up the structure of the cauldron before lighting it at the top.|$|E

25|$|Code {{optimization}} can be also broadly {{categorized as}} platform-dependent and platform-independent techniques. While the latter ones are effective on {{most or all}} platforms, platform-dependent techniques use specific properties of one platform, or rely on parameters depending on the single platform or even on the single processor. Writing or producing {{different versions of the}} same code for different processors might therefore be needed. For instance, in the case of compile-level optimization, platform-independent techniques are generic techniques (such as loop <b>unrolling,</b> reduction in function calls, memory efficient routines, reduction in conditions, etc.), that impact most CPU architectures in a similar way. Generally, these serve to reduce the total instruction path length required to complete the program and/or reduce total memory usage during the process. On the other hand, platform-dependent techniques involve instruction scheduling, instruction-level parallelism, data-level parallelism, cache optimization techniques (i.e., parameters that differ among various platforms) and the optimal instruction scheduling might be different even on different processors of the same architecture.|$|E
25|$|Each February, Tim Hortons holds a {{marketing}} campaign called Roll Up the Rim to Win. As of 2007, over 31 million prizes were distributed each year, including vehicles, televisions, and store products. Customers {{determine if they}} have won prizes by <b>unrolling</b> the rim on their paper cups when they have finished their drink, revealing the result underneath. Prizes are not distributed randomly country-wide; each of the company's distribution regions has distinct prize-winning odds. The idea for the campaign began in 1985 when Roger Wilson of one of Tim Hortons' supplier of cups, Lily Cup company, approached Tim Hortons with a new idea to increase their sales. Wilson explained his company had created a new cup design that allowed a message to be printed under the rim; the cup type cost {{no more than the}} current one and could enable a promotion, like a contest. Recognizing the opportunity to promote coffee in the normally weak sales period in the spring, the Roll Up the Rim to Win campaign was first held in 1986 when the biggest prize was a snackbox of Timbits. In 2008, over 88% of major prizes were redeemed.|$|E
25|$|Nicholson {{approached}} {{the problem by}} constructing a development of the intrados of the arch from the plan and elevation drawings, effectively <b>unrolling</b> and flattening the surface, then drawing the courses perpendicular to the faces, adding the header joints perpendicular to the courses, then finally rolling up the development diagram by projecting the detail of the intrados back onto the plan and elevation drawings, a technique also used by others who would later offer alternative solutions to the problem. This method resulted in the courses of stone voussoirs making up {{the barrel of the}} skew arch following parallel helical paths between the abutments, giving the view along the barrel an attractive rifled appearance. Although these courses meet the arch faces at right angles at the crown of the arch, the nearer they are to the springing line the greater their deviation from perpendicularity. Thus Nicholson's method is not the perfect solution, but it is a workable one that has one great advantage over more purist alternatives, namely that since the helical courses run parallel to each other, all the voussoir stones can be cut to the same pattern, the only exceptions being the ring stones, or quoins, where the barrel meets the faces of the arch, each of which is unique but has an identical copy in the other face.|$|E

While the men are jogging, a truck splashes mud into Forrest's face, and the salesman gives him a yellow shirt to wipe the mud off. Forrest rolls up the shirt and hands it back, saying [...] "{{have a nice day}}". <b>Unrolling</b> the shirt, the man finds a smiley face outlined on it. Thus the film credits Forrest Gump with inventing the Smiley logo and the have a nice day slogan.|$|E
500|$|The {{paper and}} {{pigments}} in ukiyo-e paintings {{are sensitive to}} light and seasonal changes in humidity. [...] Mounts must be flexible, as the sheets can tear under sharp changes in humidity. [...] In the Edo era, the sheets were mounted on long-fibred paper and preserved scrolled up in plain paulownia boxes placed in another lacquer wooden box. [...] In museum settings display times must be limited to prevent deterioration from exposure to light and environmental pollution. [...] Scrolling causes concavities in the paper, and the <b>unrolling</b> and rerolling of the scrolls causes creasing. [...] Ideal relative humidity for scrolls should be kept between 50% and 60%; brittleness results from too dry a level.|$|E
500|$|North American {{cultures}} have traditionally depicted spiders. The Native American Lakota people's oral tradition {{also includes a}} spider-trickster figure, which is known by several names. As chronicled in the legend of The [...] "Wasna" [...] (Pemmican) Man and the Unktomi (Spider), [...] a man encounters a hungry spider family, and the hero Stone Boy is tricked out of his fancy clothes by Unktomi, a trickster spider figure. The spider is also present as the deity Iktomi, which is occasionally depicted in this form. In Native American mythology, the spider is also seen in the legend about {{the birth of the}} constellation Ursa Major. The constellation was seen as seven men transformed into stars and climbing to paradise by <b>unrolling</b> a spider's web. The Hopi have the creation myth of Spider Grandmother. In this story, Spider Grandmother thought the world into existence through the conscious weaving of her webs. Spider Grandmother also {{plays an important role in}} the creation mythology of the Navajo, and there are stories relating to Spider Woman in the heritage of many Southwestern native cultures as a powerful helper and teacher.|$|E

Jing Ke {{continued}} to advance toward the king, while explaining that his partner [...] "has never set eyes on the Son of Heaven", {{which is why he}} is trembling. Jing Ke had to present both gifts by himself. While <b>unrolling</b> the map, a dagger was revealed. The king drew back, stood on his feet, but struggled to draw the sword to defend himself. At the time, other palace officials were not allowed to carry weapons. Jing Ke pursued the king, attempting to stab him, but missed. King Zheng drew out his sword and cut Jing Ke's thigh. Jing Ke then threw the dagger, but missed again. Suffering eight wounds from the king's sword, Jing Ke realized his attempt had failed and knew that both of them would be killed afterwards. The Yan state was conquered by the Qin state five years later.|$|E
2500|$|The cost of {{the project}} was $21 million US dollars which was raised entirely by Christo and Jeanne-Claude selling studies, drawings, collages, works from the 1950s and 1960s. They do not accept any sponsorship, nor did the city of New York have to provide any money for the project. Christo and Jeanne-Claude donated all the money raised from the sale of souvenirs such as postcards, T-shirts and posters to [...] "Nurture New York's Nature, Inc." [...] While the engineering, {{manufacturing}} and set-up took over a year, about 750 paid employees erected the project in five days and then deployed the fabric of all the gates in half an hour. Around 600 more ("Gate-keepers") distributed 1 million free samples of the fabric to visitors.

More workers uninstalled the project in one week, leaving almost no trace and shipping all the materials for recycling.|$|E
2500|$|The trilogy {{would appear}} {{to belong to a}} context of tragic poetry and epic drama, albeit {{distinctly}} postmodern at the same time. It explores the deep structure of tragedy instead of its formal characteristics, having thus been called a post-tragic work. [...] Homer, Aeschylus and Dante as well as the darker aspects of romantic poetry together with symbolism, expressionism, and an intense religious and philosophical interest permeate the work. Poena Damni has thus been related, despite its postmodern traits, more to the High Modernist tradition of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf The first of the three pieces, [...] (Z213: ΕΞΟΔΟΣ), accounts a man's escape from a guarded city and his journey through dreamlike, sometimes nightmarish, lands. In the second book, With the People from the Bridge (Με τους ανθρωπους απο τη γεφυρα) the protagonist of [...] becomes a first-degree Narrator appearing as one spectator in a makeshift play performed under the arches of a derelict train station.

2500|$|Not deterred by {{his earlier}} rebuttal, Churchill set out his [...] "constructive plan" [...] in a {{memorandum}} headed Operation Jupiter dated 1 May 1942, addressed to Major General Hastings [...] "Pug" [...] Ismay, the Secretary of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. In that document, Churchill explained his objectives {{for the proposed}} operation, which he considered was of [...] "high strategic and political importance" [...] and {{should be considered as}} an alternative to Operation Sledgehammer, the US proposal for an invasion of France, which was scheduled for later that year. Churchill wrote: [...] "If we could gain possession of these airfields [...] and establish an equal force there, not only would the northern sea route to Russia be kept open, but we should have set up a second front on a small scale from which it would be most difficult to eject us. If the going was good we could advance slowly southward, <b>unrolling</b> the Nazi map of Europe from the top". As a preliminary, six squadrons of British fighters would be based at Murmansk in Russia. Abandoning the idea of taking Trondheim, Petsamo area on the north coast of Finland would be the site of an initial seaborne assault by a division-sized force, while a brigade would capture the airfield at Porsanger Fjord. Churchill thought that surprise could be achieved by the invasion transports being disguised as an Arctic convoy and that the troops could be accommodated on board the same ships during the winter. He claimed that careful planning could avoid an [...] "undue strain" [...] being put upon the Home Fleet. As instructed, the Chiefs of Staff referred the memo to the Joint Planning Staff.|$|E
