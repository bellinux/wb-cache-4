5|$|Nanako Kato, a {{spokesperson}} from Sony Computer Entertainment, addressed the matter from Tokyo. She {{pointed out that}} historical buildings are often used in entertainment, such as in iconic movie scenes involving Godzilla and the Tokyo Tower and King Kong in Manhattan. She acknowledged {{the church in the}} game holds a resemblance to Manchester Cathedral, but that the point was to depict a backdrop of an old church, not to illustrate a specific church. She added that Sony <b>understands</b> <b>why</b> the Church of England was offended especially because of its efforts to reduce the serious problem of gun violence in Manchester. She did not answer on whether Sony would donate money to the Cathedral's anti-gun program as the Church has demanded. At the time, over 2million copies of the game had been sold.|$|E

Prushevsky does not follow suit. A girl asks him to teach her knowledge, and he leaves the worksite with her.

Suddenly, Marceline's father <b>understands</b> <b>why</b> she is upset, and the two reconnect.

In 2012, Capcom's Street Fighter producer Yoshinori Ono {{said he is}} {{getting a lot of}} requests for Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat and <b>understands</b> <b>why</b> people want it, [...] "but it's easier said than done. Having Chun Li getting her spine ripped out, or Ryu's head bouncing off the floor...it doesn't necessarily match." [...] In 2014, martial artist Frankie Edgar opined Mortal Kombat has been far superior to Street Fighter.|$|E

There is no question of us separating ourselves from Rome, nor of putting ourselves under a foreign government, nor of establishing a sort of parallel church as the Bishops of Palmar de Troya have done in Spain.

In the morning, the window is covered with frost and the Snowman cannot see the stove. He is stove-sick and cannot enjoy the frosty weather. [...] The dog warns the snowman of an {{imminent}} change in the weather. A thaw descends, and, one morning, the snowman collapses.

500|$|Record {{companies}} have described bootlegs as [...] "grey area, live recordings", describing them as [...] "semi-condoned". Research into bootleg consumers {{found that they}} are committed fans of the artist; a study of Bruce Springsteen fans showed 80% felt some bootlegs were essential purchases despite owning every official release. Springsteen has said he <b>understands</b> <b>why</b> fans buy bootlegs, but dislikes the market {{due to the lack}} of quality control and making profit over pleasing fans. Frank Zappa hated bootlegs and wished to control his recordings, so he created the Beat The Boots boxed sets, each containing eight LPs that were direct copies of existing bootlegs. He set up a hotline for fans to report bootlegs and was frustrated that the FBI were not interested in prosecuting. The first set included As An Am Zappa, in which he can be heard complaining about bootleggers releasing new material before he could.|$|E
500|$|Louis XIV {{gave the}} exiled King and Queen {{the use of}} Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, where they set up court-in-exile. Mary soon became a popular fixture at Louis XIV's court at Versailles, where diarist Madame de Sévigné {{acclaimed}} Mary for her [...] "distinguished bearing and her quick wit". Questions of precedence, however, marred Mary's relations with the Dauphine of France, Maria Anna of Bavaria. Because Mary was accorded the privileges and rank of a queen, Maria Anna was outranked by her. Therefore, Maria Anna refused to see Mary, etiquette being a sensitive issue at Versailles. In spite of this, Louis XIV and his secret wife, Madame de Maintenon, became close friends with Mary. As there was no queen at the French court, nor a dauphine after 1690, Mary took precedence over all the female members of the French court and French royal house, as did her daughter in her capacity of a royal princess until the next French dauphine appeared in 1711. James was largely excluded from French court life. His contemporaries found him boring, and French courtiers frequently joked that [...] "when one talks to him, one <b>understands</b> <b>why</b> he is here." [...] Mary gave birth to Princess Louise Mary in 1692. She was to be James and Mary's last child.|$|E

500|$|Susan meets Jim at the {{hospital}} and remembers him from the work he did on Lyn Scully's (Janet Andrewartha) house. They get talking and Jim reveals he just had a melanoma removed and he is a bit [...] "bewildered" [...] by {{the hospital}} process and Susan helps him out. Jim's condition grows worse and he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Susan learns he has no family and Woodburne said she instinctively wants to look after him. The actress said Susan crosses boundaries as she starts to neglect certain areas of her life, like her marriage. She tells Karl not to be selfish and that the situation is not about him or her, it is about Jim. Woodburne explained to Channel 5 that Karl's reaction to Susan's friendship with Jim changes and he starts thinking he should not be selfish. However, when he notices his wife becoming more involved with Jim and neglecting her responsibilities, Karl gets angry as she is not thinking about anything else. Susan and Karl's eldest son, Malcolm, returns to Erinsborough to help his parents work through their issues. Woodburne thought Malcolm was initially on Susan's side because he can see she is helping someone who is ill, but as he looks more closely he <b>understands</b> <b>why</b> his father is so upset with Susan's behavior. Susan is upset when she misses Jim's last moments and blames Karl. They begin rowing, which becomes worse due to Susan's grief. Susan Hill of the Daily Star revealed Karl and Susan were to separate following a make-or-break holiday. Their decision leaves Malcolm devastated and he takes his anger out on his mother, but Karl then admits it was his decision to end the marriage. Woodburne said the Jim Dolan plot was [...] "a tremendous story which highlighted problems with Susan and Karl's marriage." [...] The actress said the storyline was challenging to play because it was emotional and she had to slap Fletcher. Of Susan's future, Woodburne said [...] "2012 will be a huge year of adjustment for Susan. She is now single and moves into an apartment of her own – and she has to find her own way. She discovers things about herself that will surprise people." ...|$|E

Champion believes that the owners are doing a disservice to the real history, the people who should be honoured [...] "by remembering who they really were and what they actually did". He <b>understands</b> <b>why</b> people report strange occurrences, the ship still creaks and groans, and people's imaginations can get away from them such that they start seeing and hearing all kinds of things, attributing them to the paranormal which they have been primed for. [...] "Ghost stories are fine", concludes Champion [...] "when presented as such.

Ashton said of the verdict, [...] "Obviously, it's not the outcome we wanted. But {{from the perspective of}} what we do, this was a fantastic case." [...] He disagrees with those who state the prosecution overcharged the case, saying, [...] "The facts that we had... this was first-degree murder. I think it all came down to the evidence.

[...] Ashton additionally explained that if the jury did not perceive first-degree murder when they saw the photograph of Caylee's skull with the duct tape, [...] "then so be it". He said he accepts the jury's decision and that it has not taken away his faith in the justice system. [...] "You can't believe in {{the rule of law and}} not accept that sometimes it doesn't go the way you think it should", stated Ashton, and explained that he <b>understands</b> <b>why</b> the case [...] "struck such a nerve" [...] with the public. [...] "I think when people see someone that they believe has so gone away from , it just outrages them." [...] Ashton also made appearances on several other talk shows in the days following, and complimented Jose Baez on his cross-examinations and as having [...] "the potential to be a great attorney".|$|E
