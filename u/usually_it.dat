5|$|Despite the warlike {{customs of}} the Vikings, {{there was an}} element of fear {{surrounding}} death and what belonged to it. If the deceased was a revenant or draugr, such a sight was frightful and ominous and <b>usually</b> <b>it</b> was interpreted {{as a sign that}} additional family members would die. It was first and foremost in times of starvation, when communities were struck with a series of misfortunes, that rumours about revenants began to flourish. The sagas tell of drastic precautions being taken after a revenant had appeared. The dead person had to die anew; a stake could be put through the corpse, or its head might be cut off in order to stop the deceased from finding its way back to the living.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is closely {{associated}} with humans. They {{are believed to have}} become associated with humans around 10,000 years ago. Subspecies P. d. bactrianus is least associated with humans and considered to be evolutionarily closer to the ancestral noncommensal populations. <b>Usually,</b> <b>it</b> is regarded as a pest, since it consumes agricultural products and spreads disease to humans and their domestic animals. Even birdwatchers often hold it in little regard because of its molestation of other birds. In most of the world, the house sparrow is not protected by law. Attempts to control house sparrows include the trapping, poisoning, or shooting of adults; the destruction of their nests and eggs; or less directly, blocking nest holes and scaring off sparrows with noise, glue, or porcupine wire. However, the house sparrow can be beneficial to humans, as well, especially by eating insect pests, and attempts at the large-scale control of the house sparrow have failed.|$|E
5|$|Though {{not highly}} {{dangerous}} to humans, the pink whipray's venomous sting {{makes it difficult}} to handle when it is thrashing in a fishing net. <b>Usually,</b> <b>it</b> must be thrown overboard before the rest of the catch can be sorted. Throughout Indonesia and Malaysia, and probably elsewhere in its range, this species is a regular incidental catch of coastal fisheries using tangle nets, bottom trawls, gillnets, seine nets, {{and to a lesser extent}} longlines. When retained, the meat, skin, and cartilage are utilized. Fishing activity in Southeast Asia is intense and largely unregulated, and this large ray may be more vulnerable to depletion than its smaller relatives because of its slower reproductive rate. The population in the Arafura Sea is thought to have been particularly affected by an Indonesian fishery targeting wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus), and Indonesian fishers are also increasingly operating illegally in Australian waters. Off northern Australia, the pink whipray is caught incidentally by the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), but bycatch levels have likely fallen significantly since the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) became compulsory in 2000.|$|E

25|$|<b>Usually,</b> <b>it</b> is {{asserted}} that the dissolution came about as Stalin wished to calm his World War II allies (particularly Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill) and keep them from suspecting the Soviet Union of pursuing a policy of trying to foment revolution in other countries.|$|E
25|$|A {{launch vehicle}} is a rocket that throws a {{satellite}} into orbit. <b>Usually</b> <b>it</b> lifts {{off from a}} launch pad on land. Some are launched at sea from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform, or aboard a plane (see air launch to orbit).|$|E
25|$|Hungarocomix. A fair {{showcasing}} the publishers' yearly {{work and}} products, also {{organized by the}} Hungarian Comic Publishers' Association. <b>Usually</b> <b>it</b> takes place {{a few weeks before}} Christmas. In 2010 it was merged with the Christmas season anime, video game, role playing events in a large event hall, causing overall mixed critical responses.|$|E

25|$|The erotic {{aspect of}} nudity {{in the arts}} has been an {{important}} factor in its attraction, and has come to be associated with certain states and emotions, such as innocence, playfulness, vulnerability, etc. Pornography does not necessarily involve a naked person, but it involves sexualized scenes, and <b>usually</b> <b>it</b> does not claim to have any artistic merit.|$|E
25|$|Caesarean {{sections}} {{are commonly}} performed in dogs, cats, horses, sheep, and cattle. <b>Usually</b> <b>it</b> is done {{as an emergency}} surgery due to difficulties in the birthing process. Certain dog breeds such as Bulldogs often need to have this surgery {{because of the size}} of the puppy's head relative to the width of the bitch's birth canal.|$|E
25|$|Orichalcum : is used {{primarily}} by the Solar Exalted. Orichalcum is rarely found in pure deposits; <b>usually,</b> <b>it</b> is created out of gold that has been heated by lava and sunlight reflected from mirrors of occult design. Orichalcum weapons excel at no one thing; instead of adding a large bonus to speed, damage or defense, they add a small bonus to all.|$|E

50|$|Committee for Contacts with Other Civilizations (ComCon or COMCON) is an {{organization}} that directs the diplomatic negotiations between Earth and alien civilizations {{as well as the}} progressors' actions towards human ones. Officially, the Earth World Council makes all decisions, but <b>usually</b> <b>it's</b> up to COMCON to decide which actions should be discussed there and which not.|$|R
25|$|Portables - Portable applications: Similar to RIPs, but in {{this case}} they're {{software}} applications instead of video games. The point of portable software {{is the fact that it}} can be placed on removable media (or any place on the local hard drive) and doesn't need installing; <b>usually</b> <b>it</b> is compressed into one executable file, by using software like VMware ThinApp or MoleBox.|$|E
25|$|These {{drugs are}} {{efficient}} for acute poisoning of arsenic, {{which refers to}} the instantaneous effects caused by arsenic poisoning. For example, headaches, vomiting or sweating {{are some of the}} common examples of an instantaneous effect. In comparison, chronic poisonous effects arise later on, and unexpectedly such as organ damage. <b>Usually</b> <b>it</b> is too late to prevent them once they appear. Therefore, action should be taken as soon as acute poisonous effects arise.|$|E
25|$|Lectionary 183, {{designated}} by siglum ℓ 183 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering) is a Greek manuscript of the New Testament, on parchment, written in uncial letters. Westcott and Hort labelled it by 38e, Scrivener by 257e. Paleographically <b>usually</b> <b>it</b> {{has been assigned}} to the 10th century. The manuscript has some lacunae {{at the end and}} inside, but they were supplied by a later hand. It is faded in parts.|$|E

Winter extreme records {{can be as}} low as -45 C, while summer heat may reach up +40 C, but <b>usually</b> <b>it's</b> about between -5 C and -20 C during winter and between 15 C and 30 C during summer in Kaluga.|$|R
5000|$|Godrich {{produced}} both of Radiohead singer Thom Yorke's solo albums, The Eraser (2006) and Tomorrow's Modern Boxes (2014). Describing his {{collaborative process}} with Godrich, Yorke said: [...] "song 'Black Swan', {{back in the}} day, was a six-minute load of crap. Except for this one juicy bit, and Godrich goes past and goes, 'That bit. Fuck the rest.' <b>Usually</b> <b>it's</b> something like that." ...|$|R
25|$|Romanization {{includes}} any {{use of the}} Latin alphabet {{to transliterate}} Hebrew words. <b>Usually</b> <b>it</b> is to identify a Hebrew word in a non-Hebrew language that uses the Latin alphabet, such as German, Spanish, Turkish, and so on. Transliteration uses an alphabet to represent the letters and sounds of a word spelled in another alphabet, whereas transcription uses an alphabet to represent the sounds only. Romanization can do both.|$|E
25|$|He fired {{only when}} {{he thought he could}} destroy. Two hundred and fifty yards was the {{distance}} from which he liked best to fire. A couple of short, hard burst from there and that was <b>usually</b> <b>it.</b> He picked his targets off cleanly and decisively, swinging his sight smoothly through them as a first-class shot strokes driven partridges out of the sky. It was a fluent and calculated exercise... For Beurling the confirmed kill was the thing.|$|E
25|$|First a new lyrical form called imayō (今様, modern style, {{a form of}} ryūkōka) emerged. Imayō {{consists}} of four lines in 8-5 (or 7-5) syllables. <b>Usually</b> <b>it</b> was sung {{to the accompaniment of}} instrumental music and dancing. Female dancers (shirabyōshi) danced to the accompaniment of imayō. Major works were compiled into the Ryōjin Hishō (梁塵秘抄) anthology. Although originally women and commoners are thought to be proponents of the genre, Emperor Go-Shirakawa was famed for his mastery of imayō.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the role}} of the {{executive}} varies from country to country, <b>usually</b> <b>it</b> will propose the majority of legislation, and propose government agenda. In presidential systems, the executive often has the power to veto legislation. Most executives in both systems are responsible for foreign relations, the military and police, and the bureaucracy. Ministers or other officials head a country's public offices, such as a foreign ministry or defence ministry. The election of a different executive is therefore capable of revolutionising an entire country's approach to government.|$|E
25|$|Closest to {{the enemy}} are several lines of {{anti-tank}} obstacles and minefields. <b>Usually</b> <b>it</b> means a V or U-trench and a wall or dragon’s teeth row, while moats, hedgehogs and berms have been used very rarely because they are difficult to be camouflaged. Behind this lies an extensive, at least 30-meter-wide anti-infantry entanglement, which is a mixed system of apron fences, wire concertinas, electric fences, traps, mines, nail spikes and spike pits. Both elements are well camouflaged by good location (relief) and by plants (e.g. small height bushes in front of ditches).|$|E
25|$|Libraries are {{important}} in the program linking or binding process, which resolves references known as links or symbols to library modules. The linking process is usually automatically done by a linker or binder program that searches a set of libraries and other modules in a given order. <b>Usually</b> <b>it</b> is not considered an error if a link target can be found multiple times in a given set of libraries. Linking may be done when an executable file is created, or whenever the program is used at run time.|$|E
