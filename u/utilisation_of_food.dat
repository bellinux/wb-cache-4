40|$|Available {{evidence}} {{suggests that there are}} at least two locations for dormancy mechanisms in primary dormant seeds: mechanisms based within the embryo covering structures, and mechanisms based within the embryo. Mechanisms within the covering structures may involve mechanical, permeability and chemical barriers to germination. Mechanisms within the embryo may involve the expression of certain genes, levels of certain plant growth regulators, the activity of important respiratory pathways or the mobilisation and <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> reserves. In addition, some embryos may be too immature to germinate immediately and must undergo a further growth phase before germination is possible. An individual species could have one or several of these various dormancy mechanisms and these mechanisms need to be understood when selecting treatments to overcome dormancy. The way in which certain dormancy breaking agents are thought to work is discussed and practical applications of such agents in field situations are explained...|$|E

40|$|Food {{is often}} cited {{as a form of}} soft power, with Joesph Nye {{explicitly}} mentioning food in his initial writings upon soft power. However, the understanding of food as a form of soft power remains questionable with most academics glossing over food’s soft power in preference to other forms that possess greater politically visibility. This paper addresses this lack of scholarly discussion that surrounds the subject of food as a source of soft power, providing a comprehensive guide to the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> as a vehicle for soft power. Citing contemporary academic and real world conceptualisations of soft power, this paper creates a framework to identify how soft power is implemented by political actors, allowing food to become both a source and a means of implementing coercion at different political levels. Case studies will validate this framework and cover the full spectrum of political actors including nation states (America and Japan); corporations (McDonalds and Monsanto); interest groups and organisations (Slow Food); as well as individuals (Michal Pollan and Jamie Oliver). This paper summates that food can be a useful soft power vehicle, and when applied correctly can produce control and coercion in both the political and social spheres. ...|$|E
40|$|The global goal of ‘Food for All’, {{considered}} a fundamental human right {{by most of}} the countries, remains an unfinished item on the agenda of national governments and the international development community. In developing countries, household food insecurity is still widespread and its human and social consequences are most visible in rural areas. Poverty is one of the root causes for household food insecurity. Many poor people in rural areas directly or indirectly depend on small scale agriculture for their livelihood. At the same time, these people have limited access to livelihood securing assets that reduce their vulnerability to bio-physical, economic and social shocks. As the global interest in organic agriculture grows, an obvious question is to what extent the employment of organic agriculture principles and practices mitigate people’s vulnerability to food insecurity. The answer to this question is still contested, often political and influenced by the people’s beliefs and traditional position. For example, to agricultural experts and observers associated with conventional schools of thought, organic agriculture is associated with high labour cost and declining crop yields. According to this conventional proposition, organic agriculture results in temporal or permanent food shortages at household level. On {{the other side of the}} spectrum, agricultural experts and observers associated with alternative viewpoints on agricultural development argue that organic agriculture is a viable strategy that ensures household food security. Unfortunately both propositions are simplistic. By using examples from East Africa, the purpose of this presentation is to discuss the various linkages between organic agriculture and household food security. It seems that these linkages can be positive, neutral or negative. Based on the standard definition of household food security, which addresses three essential dimensions: the availability of food (i. e. sufficient agricultural production), access to food (i. e. the ability of obtain food for cash resources or in kind) and the proper <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> (i. e. the ability to make use of available food for a balanced diet), a closer examination of the food security “equations” of organic agriculture is being conducted. This examination suggests that organic agriculture project philosophies and cultures have an impact on people’s availability, access and <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> differently, hence food security “equations” vary across organic agriculture projects and schemes. Given the diverse food security implications of organic agriculture in developing countries, a fact that is hardly recognised by consumers in the industrialised countries, a plea for more research into the food security implications of organic agriculture is made. There is no doubt that organic agriculture in developing countries substantially contributes to the development of food security of small scale farmers. This household food security potential, however, is not always fully realised which may limit the contribution of organic agriculture towards the goal ‘Food for All’...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{relatively}} new {{approach is the}} use of insects as a source of animal protein in fish nutrition. Houseflies larvae utilise decaying organic waste to produce animal protein and the larvae can be used to produce a meal (magmeal). Interestingly study of the use of magmeal as substitute for fish meal in fish diets have increased in recent times. In the present work, a feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the potential of housefly maggot meal (magmeal) as a protein source for Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus niloticus). The {{results of the present study}} revealed that all the experimental diets were accepted by O. niloticus niloticus. This implies that the different experimental feed ingredients did not affect the palatability of the diets. The good overall growth performances and no mortality obtained in both experimental group of this study confirm the suitability of chosen nutritional composition for tilapia. FCR values below 1 have been reported here, indicating the most efficient <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> by Oreochromis niloticus niloticus. The fish fed on maggot diet exhibited a higher K value compared to those fed on commercial diet. The results suggested that dietary maggot meal promoted the growth of Nile tilapia and enhanced nutrient utilization which is reflected in improved length gain, weight gain, FCR, and SGR. Progressive increment in length gain, weight gain and SGR were observed in maggot meal based diet, recording better growth than commercial based diet...|$|E

The results of this thesis show that algae differ in their attractiveness and quality for Collembola and even euedaphic species benefit from them. Sympatric species of Collembola show differences in their food choice behaviour as well as in the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> ingested <b>food.</b> The lipid analysis of consumers and their recourses assigned two new trophic biomarkers for Collembola reared on algal diets. Furthermore, this study provided proof that living algal cells can be detected in the faeces of Collembola. This confirms the assumption that Collembola contribute to the dispersal of algae. Simultaneously, fatty acid pattern of faecal pellets suggested that faeces are enriched with gut-associated microorganisms which were also deposited.

40|$|High {{levels of}} {{hydrological}} connectivity during seasonal flooding provide significant opportunities for movements of fish between rivers and their floodplains, estuaries and the sea, possibly mediating food web subsidies among habitats. To determine {{the degree of}} <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> sources from different habitats in a tropical river with a short floodplain inundation duration (* 2 months), stable isotope ratios in fishes and their available food were measured from three habitats (inundated floodplain, dry season freshwater, coastal marine) in the lower reaches of the Mitchell River, Queensland (Australia). Floodplain food sources constituted {{the majority of the}} diet of largebodied fishes (barramundi Lates calcarifer, catfish Neoarius graeffei) captured on the floodplain in the wet season and for gonadal tissues of a common herbivorous fish (gizzard shad Nematalosa come), the latter suggesting that critical reproductive phases are fuelled by floodplain production. Floodplain food sources also subsidised barramundi from the recreational fishery in adjacent coastal and estuarine areas, and the broader fish community from a freshwater lagoon. These findings highlight the importance of the floodplain in supporting the production of large fishes in spite of the episodic nature and relatively short duration of inundation compared to large river floodplains of humid tropical regions. They also illustrate the high degree of food web connectivity mediated by mobile fish in this system in the absence of human modification, and point to the potential consequences of water resource development that may reduce or eliminate hydrological connectivity between the river and its floodplain.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} a field study in Block Jaisinagar, Madhya Pradesh (MP), India and analyses to what extent the Public Distribution System (PDS) and the Mid-Day Meals Scheme (MMS) help women and their children to improve their food and nutrition security (FNS) sit-uation. The effective functioning of the food schemes with regards to inclusion and exclusion of High Caste, Dalit and Tribal women and the access and <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> are assessed. The field work has been conducted with the support of Self-Reliant Initiatives through Joint Action (SRIJAN), an Indian grassroots implementation and support organisation committed to promote sustainable and self-reliant models of rural development. This thesis will argue that the PDS and MMS do not function efficiently enough and that the most vulnerable population groups – Dalit and Tribal women and children – often face major problems in the access to the food schemes due to low financial and social capital, frequently resulting in their exclusion. There are incidents of High Caste women having higher financial capital and social status who bribe officials responsible for the schemes to be included and thus have a favourable position in the PDS. Dalit and Tribal women are further denied the position of the MMS cook, as caste-based social exclusion and discrimination prevails in the research area and also affects Dalit children during the food distribution in the MMS. The food schemes thus fail to guarantee the right to food to everyone and to those who depend on it the most...|$|E
40|$|Calanoid copepods of {{the genus}} Pseudocalanus {{constitute}} important members of the zooplankton in the northern hemisphere and {{play a major role}} in the recruitment and stock dynamics of commercially used fish. This study analyses the population dynamics of the calanoid copepod Pseudocalanus spp. in the Baltic and North Sea ecosystems in the framework of the GLOBEC Germany Project. It compares life cycle characteristics, vital rates and secondary production of the two congener species, P. acuspes from the Baltic Sea and P. elongatus from the North Sea. Reproduction, growth and secondary production of these species are interpreted in the light of the nutritional environment and hydrography. The comparison of P. acuspes from the Baltic Sea and P. elongatus from the North Sea revealed strong differences in the population dynamics of this morphologically similar congener species. The highly stratified Baltic Sea makes high demands on the distribution of the glacial relict P. acuspes, which is adapted to a life at high latitudes. To reach optimal temperature conditions, a vertical distribution below the summer thermocline is compellent. This vertical innidation prevents <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> from the euphotic zone by this primarily herbivorous species. The food limitation, the low salinity and the low temperatures in the Baltic Sea lead to diminished growth rates of all stages of P. acuspes, which is indicated by the stage structure and the slow development in May and July. Compared to that, the growth of P. elongatus seemed to be unlimited by food particularly during spring and summer, which is indicated by lower stage durations and higher growth rates and results in a higher max. secondary production. These differences emphasise the importance of careful identification and studies of key species for an understanding of their role in the marine ecosystem...|$|E

The essential oils of seven Lamiaceae species were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and assayed for their antibacterial, antifungal and mutagenic activities. Monoterpenes in the oils ranged between 82. 47 % (hyssop oil) and 97. 48 % (thyme oil), being mainly represented by oxygenated compounds. The antibacterial activity was evaluated against six pathogenic and five non-pathogenic bacterial strains. Oregano and thyme oils showed the strongest antibacterial activity against the pathogenic ones. The antifungal activity was evaluated against six fungal strains of agrifood interest: the oils tested exhibited variable degrees of activity.

40|$|Food losses occur {{throughout}} the entire food chain, from primary production via postharvest handling and storage, to food processing, distribution, retailing and consumption. Globally, food losses account for about one third <b>of</b> the total <b>food</b> produced for human consumption. The aim of this report was to map the production and <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> co-streams in the food processing industry in Norway and to discuss possibilities for alternative utilisation based on qualitative aspects of the co-streams, and current legislation. This report is produced by work package 3 in the CYCLE project (2013 - 2016), “Total <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> raw materials in the supply chain for food with a bioeconomical perspective”. The CYCLE project aims to improve resource utilisation in the Norwegian food chain by developing sustainable eco-friendly bio-processes and novel technology, in close relationship with food industry partners. Inputs and outputs of organic materials were roughly mapped at selected food processing plants presenting three Norwegian food chains: 1) Vegetables and potatoes; 2) white and pelagic fish; and 3) poultry. Data was collected during plant visits in June 2013, and later checked by staff from the described plants. The report describes the qualitative properties of co-streams, and their current utilisation as feed, fertiliser and as substrate for bioenergy production. We also present relevant regulations in EU and Norway regarding processing and <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> co-streams, and discuss alternative utilisation. Altogether, the food processing plants had significant market shares in Norway within fresh potatoes (38 %), lettuce (17 %), poultry meat (24 %) and white and pelagic fish, where export makes up a large proportion. Generally, {{a large proportion of}} the raw materials were utilised as food and feed. On average for all plants, 75 % of the raw material was utilised in food products, 21 % in feed products, 1 % in fertiliser and bioenergy production and 3 % was deposited in landfill. The plants used in average 8. 6 tonnes of process water per tonne <b>of</b> <b>food</b> produced, but the amount varied considerably between the plants. Possible improvements in the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> raw materials and co-streams include a higher degree <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> in <b>food</b> products, and developing new or improved feed components from co-streams with increased nutritional value. Due to the current high degree <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> in <b>food</b> and feed applications with high economic values, the potential for bioenergy and fertiliser production is limited to certain risk materials. Feed potatoes and vegetables and feathers, bones, blood, viscera and skin from fish or poultry have considerable potential for better utilisation for food or feed. Relevant processing methods for these co-streams are fractionation, hydrolysis, fermentation and drying...|$|R
40|$|Food {{security}} {{is not only}} a problem in sub-Saharan Africa; also Latin American countries still face hunger and malnutrition. In Peru, a draft legislation on the promotion of local farmers’ markets shall improve the situation of the poor Andean farmers by obliging local municipalities to organise regular markets. Based on a fieldwork in Huánuco, Peru, this thesis illustrates the relation between the commercialisation of agricultural products in local farmers’ markets and the food security of the participating farmers. Taking the draft legislation as a framework, a survey with the markets participants in the three markets of Huánuco was used to clarify what impact the commercialisation can have on the farmers’ access to and the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> This thesis shows that the farmers sell a relatively high share of their production, including tubers, animals, fruits and vegetables. Instead of consuming their own produce, the farmers rely on food purchases where they spend a good portion of their earnings on processed aliments like rice, oil, pasta, sugar and salt. Most of the farmers base their diet on a small variety of aliments such as rice, maize, potato, beans and pasta. Although the farmers also consume regional products frequently, many of them only consume a small share of their own production. The consumption patterns indicate that the farmers do not balance their diet appropriately. The farmers have knowledge about the nutritional value of the aliments they consume but the consumption habits are dominated by local perceptions of an adequate diet that includes the daily consumption of rice. It is recommended to include a thorough educational aspect when markets are to be established under the new law. Both municipalities and the associations that organise the markets need to ensure that farmers can increase their knowledge on nutrition, marketing and sanitation. Thereby, famers can be incentivised to consume their most nutritious aliments, instead of selling them...|$|E
40|$|While {{most studies}} of the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> {{resources}} in aquatic ecosystems have focused on comparing the diets of closely related taxa, {{the present study was}} aimed at elucidating whether the diets of five species, representing two distant taxa, were correlated and overlapped. We have thus compared the diets of a fish species (the flathead, Platycephalus speculator) with those of two small species of cormorant (little pied, Phalocrocorax melanoleucos, and little black, P. sulcirostris) and two larger species of cormorant (pied, P. varius, and black, P. carbo) in a temperate southwestern Australian estuary. The flathead and the two smaller cormorants consumed predominantly shrimp and small, short-lived teleosts, whereas the two larger cormorants fed almost exclusively on larger species of teleost. Although the diet of flathead were correlated with and overlapped those of the two smaller cormorant species, there was no correlation or overlap between the diets of these three species and those of either of the larger species of cormorant. Our observations of P. speculator are consistent with the results of previous studies which have shown that platycephalids are ambush predators, whereas cormorants are pursuit surface plungers, with the little pied cormorant feeding solitarily and the little black cormorant feeding communally. Flathead preyed on both demersal and mid-water teleosts. The little pied cormorant fed almost exclusively on demersal teleosts and the little black cormorant exploited predominantly mid-water schooling fish. Thus, differences in the fish components of the diets of these three predators can be related to differences in the mode of foraging and the level in the water column in which feeding takes place. The respective daily consumption of shrimp and teleosts in the estuary was estimated as 1, 000 kg and 450 kg by flathead and as 180 kg and 150 kg by the four species of cormorants combined. The results of this study show that, in estuaries, the degree to which diets were correlated and overlapped amongst predatory vertebrates can be greater between representatives of distant taxa than between species within the same genus...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Market lamb {{production}} usually requires {{a short period}} of time. The success of production is therefore dependent upon the growth rate of the lambs which is influenced by milk yields of the ewes. Different growth potentials of animals result from a difference in their <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> Since metabolism affects the blood constituents which can be measured, it was the objective of this experiment to study the variations of blood amino acid and urea nitrogen levels of lambs and their dams during the suckling period. The relationship between constituents and the relationship of each constituent with weight and age of lambs were studied. Also relationships of blood constituents of ewes with blood constituents, weights and ages of lambs were studied. Five breeds of sheep were used: Willamette, Suffolk, Columbia, Dorset Horn and Border Cheviot. Weights of lambs were recorded {{at the same time as}} blood samples were taken from lambs and their dams. The experiment was conducted for seven two-week periods during the Winter and Spring of 1962. Blood amino acid and urea nitrogen levels were found to be associated with growth of lambs. Blood amino acid nitrogen levels of lambs were different due to breeds (P <. 01) but not due to periods, while urea nitrogen levels of the blood were different due to periods and types of birth (P <. 01). Suffolks showed the highest level of blood amino acid nitrogen, a level of 7. 84 mg. whereas Columbias gave a value of 7. 23 mg. per 100 ml. of blood which was the lowest level. Twins had lower levels of blood urea nitrogen than singles and both groups showed a steady decrease in the concentrations of urea as they became older and larger. The correlation coefficient between these constituents was highly significant, whereas no relationship was found within periods between either constituent and weights or ages of lambs. Body weight of the lambs was highly correlated with age. In the case of ewes, blood constituents were associated with milk yields and growth of lambs. Both constituents showed effects of breeds and periods. While blood amino acid levels were not extremely variable, blood urea nitrogen levels markedly increased at the second period then steadily decreased until the end of the experiment. Blood amino acid nitrogen levels of ewes were highly correlated with those of lambs (P <. 01), while this relationship was not detected for blood urea nitrogen. A negative correlation coefficient between blood urea nitrogen levels of ewes and body weights of lambs was highly significant (P <. 01) in Willamettes, Suffolks, and Columbias, while in Dorset Horns and Border Cheviots it was not significant. However, the average correlation coefficient within breeds and periods was not significant...|$|E

40|$|The ADI as a {{tool for}} risk {{management}} and regulation <b>of</b> <b>food</b> additives and pesticide residues is not readily applicable to inherent food plant toxicants: The margin between actual intake and potentially toxic levels is often small; application of the default uncertainty factors used to derive ADI values, particularly when extrapolating from animal data, would prohibit the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>food,</b> which may have an overall beneficial health effect. Levels of inherent toxicants are difficult to control; their complete removal is not always wanted, due to their function for the plant or for human health. The health impact of the inherent toxicant is often modified by factors in the food, e. g. the bioavailability from the matrix and interaction with other inherent constituents. Risk-benefit analysis should be made for different consumption scenarios, without the use of uncertainty factors. Crucial in this approach is analysis of the toxicity of the whole foodstuff. The relationship between the whole foodstuff and the pure toxicant is expressed in the ‘product correction factor' (PCF). Investigations in humans are essential so that biomarkers of exposure and for effect can be used to analyse the difference between animals and humans and between the food and the pure toxicant. A grid of the variables characterising toxicity is proposed, showing their inter-relationships.

40|$|The {{ecology and}} biology of Nemobius bivittatus Walker was studied {{both in the}} {{laboratory}} and in the field. This species exhibits a univoltine and a semivoltine life-cycle, the semivoltine cycle lasting 19 to 20 months. N. bivittatus shows considerable adaptation to varying climatic conditions. Females lay pigmented, diapausing eggs in summer and autumn; and unpigmented non-diapausing eggs in the spring. Day-length and temperature influence the types of eggs layed. High temperatures intensify diapause during summer and autumn, and low temperatures weaken or terminate diapause during winter. In the laboratory, high initial temperatures intensify egg diapause and low initial temperatures weaken or terminate diapause. Absorption of water occurs before diapause commences. Diapausing and non-diapausing eggs both hatch in the field during summer and autumn, but hatching nymphs show great variation in their development with periods ranging from 8 weeks to 1. 5 years. In the laboratory, nymphs develop {{over a period of}} 8 to 35 weeks. The eggs, nymphs and adults all show cold-hardiness during winter, with increased levels of glycerol allowing supercooling. The adults survive for 2 to 3 months. The food comprises mainly plants, with some animal material. There is a seasonal variation in the composition of food eaten. The consumption, digestion and <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> by 6 th, 7 th and 8 th instars and adults were also determined These factors vary with the different stages of development. Gross efficiency of food utilization is higher in the nymphs, but the net efficiency is higher in the adult. Calorific values of food plants were determined in different seasons. Food plants measured were grasses, forbes, rushes and mosses. Calorific values were also determined for eggs, nymphs and adults. Oxygen consumption of 7 th and 8 th instar nymphs and adults was determined at different temperatures. Oxygen consumption of 7 th and 8 th instars and adults was also determined in the field from the density biomass of these categories in the population. In addition, secondary production of 7 th and 8 th instar nymphs and adults was determined. Energy budgets at the individual and population levels were calculated from the equation: I = R+P+E Where I represents incoming energy; R the respiratory loss of energy; P energy stored as secondary production; and E energy egested as faeces. Sexual and aggressive behaviour and hierarchical relationships were also studied as was analysis of various kinds of song. The orientation and location of sound signals by females were also completed in this study of behaviour. Circadian locomotory rythms were determined the major activity occurring during daytime.

40|$|Food {{security}} is a condition whereby “all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (FAO World Food Summit, 1996). Globally, food production has kept ahead of demand for many years, yet about one billion people currently do not have such access.

New research concepts, tools and methods are needed to understand, and improve governance of, the complex interactions between these factors if such food in{{security is}} to be overcome. This is especially the case at the regional (sub-continental) level where many stakeholder groups and actors are involved in setting policies and taking decisions that affect food security outcomes. Based on six publications, this thesis therefore addresses three questions:   What are the essential characteristics of a research agenda to address food security? Why is research at the regional level important? Who needs to be involved in research design and delivery, and how are they best engaged?   The food system concept, which integrates an understanding of the activities of producing, distributing, trading and consuming food with the food security outcomes relating to access, availability and <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food,</b> provides a robust framework for analysis of these questions. A synthesis of the publications reveals an effective food security research agenda needs to not only encompass all these activities and outcomes, but also note the range of biophysical, socioeconomic and political food system drivers across and along spatial, temporal and jurisdictional scales. This is because food insecurity arises from vulnerability of the food system to combinations of stresses induced from changes in these drivers. Analysis in this thesis has shown that the ability to overcome these stresses, and thereby enhance food security, would be increased if policy and technical options were considered more specifically at regional level, in addition to at local and global levels. This is however challenging, due to the diversity of stakeholder groups operating at this level (e. g. government and NGOs; researchers and research funders; and business and civil society) all of whom have their own objectives. Further, there are numerous interactions with higher and lower levels on these scales, and insufficient knowledge and awareness of actions taken at these other levels often leads to ‘scale challenges’. Participatory research methods (e. g. surveys, consultations and scenario exercises) have been found in this research to help overcome these ‘scale challenges’.  Improved understanding of how food systems operate will help food security planning by identifying where, when and how vulnerability arises; and hence what sorts of adaptation interventions are needed, and where and when they would be most effective. Understanding can be enhanced by integrating concepts from production ecology, agroecology and human ecology with concepts of food systems and scales, to develop the notion of ‘food system ecology’. This not only helps identify the many biophysical and socioeconomic interactions across the range of activities and drivers that determine food security, but also provides a framework for two key research avenues: increasing the efficiency with which inputs to the food system are used, and enhancing food system governance.  ...|$|E
40|$|Master of Consumer Sciences, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Food {{security}} is essential amongst households as it enables consumers {{to live a}} healthy and productive life. Determining factors for households to be classified as food secure is the availability, accessibility and <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> in a sustainable manner as food availability and accessibility alone are not enough for households to be food secure. The food utilisation aspect of food security, which includes the type of food consumed, food knowledge and food handling practices, should therefore also be considered as it determines the quantity, quality and safety of food. High percentages {{of the population in}} the Northern Cape province of South Africa has inadequate access to food, is unemployed, poorly educated, and living below the poverty line. All these aspects contribute to food insecure households. A specific community within the Northern Cape was chosen to do research regarding households‟ food security status, namely the employees of the Vaalharts Irrigation Scheme (VIS). The VIS was approached as consumers at the Vaalharts region indicated a need to improve their awareness regarding hygiene and the consumption of adequate and a variety of food. Objective: The aim {{of the study was to}} explore employees of the VIS‟ food security status. The focus of the study was therefore on consumers who earn a stable income. As food access and utilisation are fundamental aspects in determining household food security, self-production activities, food knowledge, and consumption were investigated. Methodology: A quantitative method was used to explore the study population‟s food security status with the use of a purposive sample and interviewer-administered questionnaires (n= 162). The study was conducted at the premises of VIS over a period of three weeks. Data analysis was performed by Statistical Consultation Services of the North-West University using the Statistical Program for Social Sciences. Results: Nearly one third (29. 6 %) of respondents‟ households were classified as food secure while almost half (48. 8 %) of households were at risk of being food insecure and 21. 6 % were food insecure. Only a few respondents were engaged in self-production activities with limited space being the main problem. Good basic food knowledge was identified amongst respondents and food secure respondents had better food knowledge than food insecure respondents. Food insecure respondents mainly consumed monotonous diets consisting of maize meal, chicken and milk. There was a tendency that at risk respondents consumed a larger variety of food high in protein which is also more expensive. Overall food secure respondents consumed a larger variety of food groups. There was an additional problem identified. Respondents at risk as well as food insecure respondents either do not use their income effectively or do not use resources bought, such as food optimally. Conclusions: Although all of the respondents were employed, and earned an income, only a small percentage were food secure. According to the findings, basic food knowledge, food consumption practices and income have an influence on respondents‟ food security status. These aspects which had an influence on respondents‟ food security status should be addressed especially amongst at risk and food insecure respondents through food related healthcare information. Food related healthcare information should be made available to the community via several sources (schools, clinics, churches) to improve consumers‟ awareness regarding aspects which negatively influence their food security status as well as how to improve it.

40|$|This is {{the first}} study on the epi- and hyperbenthic fauna of the surf zone of sandy beaches of the Belgian coast. Therefore, as a first {{objective}} of this thesis, {{a lot of attention}} has been paid to the inventarisation (species composition), and to the investigation of the temporal and spatial distribution patterns of both communities. A temporal and a spatial campaign were performed during which the hyper- and epibenthos was sampled. During the temporal campaign monthly samples were taken at 4 selected stations and the spatial campaign involved sampling of 12 stations along the Belgian coast. All in all, the surf zone of the Belgian coast is a habitat for a considerable number of species. The surf zone harbours a rich hyperbenthic fauna and also the epibenthic assemblage is diverse. Total hyper- and epibenthic densities were comparable or even higher than those of the adjacent, subtidal regions. It seems that the Belgian surf zone can be seen as an extension of the rich shallow sand bank system in front of the coast. Differences in total hyperbenthic densities with other European sandy beaches might be linked to the degree of exposure. An attempt was made to elucidate the major environmental variables structuring the communities. Therefore several environmental variables were measured at the moments of sampling. Different uni- and multivariate statistical techniques were used for the analyses of the data. Although clear temperature-related seasonal distribution patterns were observed, the hyper- and epibenthic communities of the surf zone can also be influenced severely by hydrodynamic factors and this both by short-term events (e. g. storm) and long-term effects (influence on morpho- dynamics of the beach). Spatial differences were found both in species richness and in density. In general, highest hyper- and epibenthic densities were found on flat, wide beaches, but also intermediate sites and sites with a high turbidity were characterised with high densities and a high number of species. Although clear distribution patterns could be observed, the much lower densities of the epibenthos compared to the hyperbenthos, might require a higher sampling effort with replicate sampling in future research. Furthermore, this study indicates that both intertidal and subtidal characteristics should be considered if the (mobile) surf zone fauna is investigated. Stomach/gut content analyses were performed on five common flatfish fish species from epibenthic samples taken during the temporal campaign in order to unravel part of the surf zone food web. Additional fish were obtained from commercial fishermen. Prey items of all species included hyperbenthic (e. g. mysids), endobenthic (e. g. polychaetes) and epibenthic (e. g. shrimps) species. Little dietary overlap was observed. If diet overlap did occur, it mainly involved prey species that are dominant in the surf zone of the studied beaches, such as shrimps and mysids. These results confirm the opportunistic utilisation by flatfish of the available food resources in surf zone ecosystems. Such opportunistic <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> resources can be important for teleosts frequenting physically stressed environments such as surf-exposed beaches. The diets of turbot Scophthalmus maximus and brill Scophthalmus rhombus reveal part of the main interactions between the hyper- and epibenthos, whereas those of plaice Pleuronectes platessa, dab Limanda limanda and sole Solea solea reveal important links between the epibenthos and the macro-endobenthos within the local surf zone food web. Three 24 -hours sampling cycles were performed to study short term migration patterns. Again the hyper- and epibenthos was sampled alternatingly each hour. Stomach content analyses were performed on juvenile plaice Pleuronectes platessa of the first 24 h-cycle (spring tide). Possible interactions between the epi- and hyperbenthic organisms are discussed. Despite the turbulent conditi...|$|E
40|$|If {{the main}} road to global {{environmental}} law began at Stockholm in 1972, {{it could be argued}} it came to an end at the neighbouring Scandinavian city of Copenhagen in 2009. Despite a return from the brink of collapse of the multilateral environmental agreement (MEA) negotiating system in relation to climate change, and possibly more widely, in Cancun in 2010 and Durban in 2011, only tentative, modest steps have been taken towards a post-Kyoto regime at these meetings. The negotiations seem destined to limp slowly forward for some years yet. The failure of the international negotiating process to produce a post-Kyoto regime that embodies commitments on a global scale to the effective reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reflects a deeper malaise in global environmental law and governance. Essentially, the global treaty system has failed to establish and implement the concept of sustainable development by establishing appropriate limits on the underlying drivers of unsustainability – namely, unconstrained economic growth, consumption, population growth and poverty. The 2012 Rio + 20 Conference is very much {{a step in the right}} direction in addressing this challenge by seeking to focus on two key themes – the “green economy” and global environmental governance. But, just as the original Rio Earth Summit Conference in 1992 saw the substantial diminution of a proposed, binding Earth Charter by producing instead the soft-law Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, there are strong concerns that the Rio + 20 conference will fail to achieve a consensus on the kind of path-breaking change in the direction of human civilisation that is needed to avoid a major ecological crisis, or even collapse, within the next one to two generations. Whilst there is no single, simple solution to the challenge of addressing the unsustainability of humanity’s current mode of existence on Earth, there are two aspects of this existence that cry out for urgent attention and which, if effectively addressed, could greatly contribute to the goal of sustainable development, or “sustainability” as it might now be more appropriately termed. The first relates to the production and consumption of energy, which underpins most human activity and particularly represents the single, greatest source of GHG emissions. The second is food production and distribution, where the limits of the Green Revolution are being reached at the same time as current levels of food production are being threatened by the loss of fertile farmlands to urbanisation, degradation and desertification, and through the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> crops for new generation biofuels. This paper will address the first of these two areas, by exploring the option of developing a new, global treaty on renewable (or “clean”) energy. The proposed treaty would be based on firm commitments by States, in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility, to achieve a transition from dependence on fossil fuels to a decarbonised, clean energy economy. It would thereby contribute to both of the key goals of Rio + 20 – by enhancing a shift by States to a green economy based firmly on renewable energy and also by providing significant, fresh impetus to the stalled global effort to reduce GHG emissions substantially over the next 10 - 20 years (thereby restoring or reinforcing confidence in global environmental governance). In proposing a global clean energy treaty, the paper will seek to identify and address the obstacles that quite obviously need to be overcome. These include technical and economic constraints that it is often suggested prevent the uptake of renewable energy on the scale required to replace fossil fuels and to meet ongoing energy demand. It will also address the common excuse of “treaty fatigue” as a reason for not pursuing new MEA’s and focussing instead on enhancing the “synergies” between existing MEA’s. Its conclusion is that these obstacles are surmountable, particularly if the concept of a global clean energy treaty is presented as an opportunity for a positive step forward towards a new, visionary future for humanity, in contrast to the unfortunate depiction of the currently proposed climate change regime, involving targets and timetables for GHG reductions, as a negative and uneconomic constraint on human activity. Environmental psychology is a critical tool in this context. If it were to be adopted, a global clean energy treaty might represent possibly the most promising and feasible pathway to avoiding extreme climate change and achieving the elusive goal of sustainability...|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} of the ecological role of lipids in the life-strategy of the pteropod Clione limacina and the adaptations to the Arctic environment. Since the sea butterfly Limacina helicina is the only food of C. limacina {{and the development of}} both species occurs simultaneously, lipid biochemical investigations of L. helicina are as well important for the assessment of the life-strategy of C. limacina. The basic questions of this thesis were studied by combining field work and experiments. The results about the seasonal lipid dynamics of C. limacina and L. helicina clearly demonstrate that lipids {{play a key role in}} both species during the ontogenetic development and reproduction. Limacina helicina is a true omnivore feeding on available particles. The fatty acid composition reflects its diet which ranged from mostly phytoplankton in spring and summer to degraded organic material in late autumn and winter. In autumn the large females of L. helicina die after spawning, and the lipid-rich veligers develop to juveniles which both are overwintering stages. For Clione limacina the seasonal field studies have shown that the fatty acids originating from the food correlate with tri-acylglycerols (TAG), whereas the odd-chain fatty acids and the monounsaturates 16 : 1 (n- 7) and 18 : 1 (n- 7) correlate with 1 -O-alkyldiacylglycerols (DAGE) and hence were mostly synthesised de novo. Both lipid classes were depleted during the ontogenetic development, maturation and reproduction in summer which underlines their importance as energy source within these processes. Due to enhanced accumulation of DAGE during autumn and a more slowly catabolism than TAG during long-term starvation this lipid class is most likely of major importance during food scarcity and over-wintering. Until now only little is known about the life-cycle of the Arctic Clione limacina. The length-frequency distribution of C. limacina revealed no unequivocal population structure why it was assessed by principal component analysis (PCA). From the seasonal lipid accumulation, de novo lipid biosynthesis and the population structure defined by the fatty acid based PCA it was concluded that C. limacina has at least a two-year life cycle or even longer. In contrast, a life cycle of one year was proposed for Limacina helicina which based on the strong depletion of lipids in females, the relatively high presence of lipids in veligers, but also on the disappearance of larger specimens in late September. The feeding experiment showed that Clione limacina assimilated up to 80 % of the ash-free dry mass of Limacina helicina. This high assimilation rate supports the very effective <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> After 5 respectively 7 days of digestion of one specimen of L. helicina, C. limacina showed highest lipid contents. Since the uptake of lipids by food ingestion accounted only for one third of the increase of lipids in C. limacina most of the lipids must be synthesised de novo from non-lipid constituents like proteins and carbohydrates. Because odd-chain fatty acids are absent in the only food of C. limacina they have to be synthesised de novo. The feeding experiment also demonstrates that C. limacina is also capable to synthesise de novo considerable amounts of 16 : 1 (n- 7), 18 : 1 (n- 7) and the alkyl moieties 16 : 0 and 15 : 0. Important knowledge about the life-strategy of Clione limacina was obtained by two different approaches of starvation experiments. The first experiment was carried out to investigate the role of lipids during long-term starvation, whereas the second was performed to examine the major sites of lipid storage, the significance of lipid droplets and the utilisation of non-lipid constituents during food-absence. The studies revealed that the lipid catabolism of C. limacina is depended on the ontogenetic stage and reproduction (egg-production). Lipid-rich animals which obviously were in gonad- or egg-development utilised lipids more quickly than post-reproductive or immature animals. These experiments also clearly demonstrated that the long-term starvation ability of C. limacina was determined by the lipid content and composition. In both experiments DAGE were utilised more slowly than TAG which shows that DAGE serve as long-term energy. The digestive gland exhibited much higher lipid levels than the lipid-droplets containing trunk. During long periods of starvation Clione limacina utilised body constituents obviously not essential for survival which are cells of the body-wall and gonads. To survive extremely long periods of starvation, respectively food scarcity, the combination of various physiological strategies seems indispensable. For C. limacina the most important strategies to withstand almost one year (exactly 356 days) without any food are very low metabolic rates in close connection with a low lipid catabolism and utilisation of body constituents not essential for survival...|$|E

Through a thorough literature review a model establishing {{the link between the}} two areas of research was created. Natural resource abundance can lead to food insecurity, if the country has low institutional quality before a resource boom. The combination of resource abundance and lack of quality institutions can then contribute to a dependence on natural resources and increased corruption. These can lead to economic decline. Accepting FAO's dimensions <b>of</b> <b>food</b> insecurity, economic decline thus causes a decrease in the availability <b>of,</b> access to, <b>utilisation</b> and stability <b>of</b> <b>food,</b> all which lead to food insecurity. This model was then tested for its applicability on the current food crisis in Venezuela, a country with one of the highest proven oil reserves worldwide.

Diatoms (Eucampia antarctica, Corethron inerme and Navicula spp.) constituted {{the bulk of the}} protists whereas microzooplankton (i. e. ciliates and dinoflagellates) were in very low abundance. Copepod grazing on phytoplankton ranged from 0. 3 to 2. 6 µgC ind- 1 d- 1 and reflected low <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>food</b> stocks (1 - 10 % of total Chlorophyll a d- 1) and low daily rations (0. 2 - 3. 3 % body C d- 1). Copepod grazing resulted in a 1. 7 - 2. 3 -fold increase in Fe regeneration. Fe speciation determined by extraction onto C 18 columns showed that less than 1 % of the regenerated Fe was complexed with hydrophobic organic ligands. This suggests that Fe was regenerated as inorganic species and/or bound to freely soluble organic ligands. The biogenic Fe budget established from our study and literature based data indicates that most of the primary production is recycled through the detrital pool, which represents the largest Fe pool (49 % of total Fe). Our iron budget further indicates that mesozooplankton and diatoms represent the dominant Fe biomasses above the Kerguelen plateau. The rate of Fe regeneration accounts for half of the Fe demand, strengthening the need for new Fe sources to sustain the massive phytoplankton bloom above the Kerguelen plateau...|$|R
