40|$|This paper compares {{results of}} lidar and Umkehr measurements, made during 1985 - 1991, which include 110 coincidences. The Umkehr ozone {{profiles}} were retrieved using the conventional <b>Umkehr</b> <b>method</b> (Gotz et al., 1934; Mateer and Dutsch, 1964), the short <b>Umkehr</b> <b>method</b> (De Luisi, 1979), and the recently developed new-conventional <b>Umkehr</b> <b>method</b> (Mateer and De Luisi, 1992) {{in which the}} conventional method {{is referred to as}} the ' 1964 algorithm' and the new-conventional method as the ' 1991 algorithm'. Results obtained show good agreement between the ozone profiles derived using the new-conventional <b>Umkehr</b> <b>method</b> and lidar ozone profiles, emphasizing the influence of the temperature dependence of the ozone cross-sections on the Umkehr ozone retrievals...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Umkehr</b> <b>method</b> for {{retrieving}} {{the gross}} {{features of the}} vertical ozone distribution requires measurements of the ratio of zenith-sky radiances at two wavelengths in the near-UV region while the solar zenith angle (SZA) changes from 60 to 90 degrees. A Brewer spectrophotometer was used for taking such measurements extending the SZA range down to 96 degrees. Analyzed data from the Spring of 1991 imply that observations at twilight are of great significance in improving ozone retrievals in the upper stratosphere. Judged by the variance reduction for Umkehr layers 9 to 12 (25 - 30 percent for layer 11) {{and the increase in}} separation and amplitude of the averaging kernels for the relevant layers, the ozone retrievals in the upper stratosphere are shown to be in better agreement with climatological means...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} Dobson Umkehr methodology {{to retrieve}} coarse-resolution ozone profiles {{used by the}} National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration uses designated solar zenith angles (SZAs). However, some information may be lost if measurements lie outside the designated SZA range (between 60 ° and 90 °), or {{do not conform to}} the fitting technique. Also, while Umkehr measurements can be taken using multiple wavelength pairs (A, C and D), past retrieval methods have focused on a single pair (C). Here we present an <b>Umkehr</b> inversion <b>method</b> that uses measurements at all SZAs (termed operational) and all wavelength pairs. (Although, we caution direct comparison to other algorithms.) Information content for a Melbourne, Australia (38 ° S, 145 ° E) Umkehr measurement case study from 28 January 1994, with SZA range similar to that designated in previous algorithms is shown. When comparing the typical single wavelength pair with designated SZAs to the operational measurements, the total degrees of freedom (independent pieces of information) increases from 3. 1 to 3. 4, with the majority of the information gain originating from Umkehr layers 2 + 3 and 4 (10 – 20 km and 25 – 30 km respectively). In addition to this, using all available wavelength pairs increases the total degrees of freedom to 5. 2, with the most significant increases in Umkehr layers 2 + 3 to 7 and 9 + (10 – 40 and 45 – 80 km). Investigating a case from 13 April 1970 where the measurements extend beyond the 90 ° SZA range gives further information gain, with total degrees of freedom extending to 6. 5. Similar increases are seen in the information content. Comparing the retrieved Melbourne Umkehr time series with ozonesondes shows excellent agreement in layers 2 + 3 and 4 (10 – 20 and 25 – 30 km) for both C and A + C + D-pairs. Retrievals in layers 5 and 6 (25 – 30 and 30 – 35 km) consistently show lower ozone partial column compared to ozonesondes. This is likely due to stray light effects that are not accounted for in the forward model, and under represented stratospheric aerosol...|$|R
40|$|Aerosol {{optical depth}} in the visible range is {{affected}} by ozone absorption (Chappuis band). In order to derive reliable information from extinction measurements of solar irradiance, a suitable correction has to be considered. Ozone correction based on climatological data sets has been proved ineffective. Better results are typically obtained {{on the basis of}} indirect methods which, nevertheless, require some nd hoc assumptions such as the wavelength dependence on aerosol optical depth. A validation of these indirect methods is provided in this paper. Direct estimations of ozone profiles have been derived from ultra-violet and visible spectral scattered solar radiation. The <b>Umkehr</b> <b>method</b> was resorted for implementing a suitable inversion scheme for the ozone profile. Our results show that indirect ozone correction procedures are really capable of yielding absorption ozone-free aerosol optical depth. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A new {{method is}} {{presented}} to determine vertical ozone profiles from measurements of spectral global (direct Sun plus upper hemisphere) irradiance in the ultraviolet. The method {{is similar to the}} widely used Umkehr technique, which inverts measurements of zenith sky radiance. The procedure was applied to measurements of a high-resolution spectroradiometer installed near the centre of the Greenland ice sheet. Retrieved profiles were validated with balloon-sonde observations and ozone profiles from the space-borne Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). Depending on altitude, the bias between retrieval results presented in this paper and MLS observations ranges between − 5 and + 3  %. The magnitude of this bias is comparable, if not smaller, to values reported in the literature for the standard Dobson <b>Umkehr</b> <b>method.</b> Total ozone columns (TOCs) calculated from the retrieved profiles agree to within 0. 7 ± 2. 0  % (± 1 σ) with TOCs measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on board the Aura satellite. The new method is called the Global-Umkehr method...|$|E
40|$|A global {{ozone data}} set {{covering}} {{the two years}} from November 1978 until October 1980, {{with an average of}} 1200 profiles per day, has been produced and archived from the solar backscattered ultraviolet (SBUV) instrument flown on the NIMBUS 7 spacecraft. The SBUV ozone profiles are compared with measurements from chemical and optical sensors launched on balloons and rockets and with ozone profiles obtained from the ground-based Dobson spectrophotometers using the <b>Umkehr</b> <b>method.</b> The biases between the SBUV results and the balloon and Umkehr results are generally less than 10 percent. These biases are functions of layer height and latitude and are believed to be largely due to inconsistencies in the ozone absorption cross sections used for the various measurement systems. The precision of the SBUV measurements is found to be better than 8 percent for pressures between 1 and 64 mbar and better than 15 percent from 64 to 253 mbar...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{standard}} retrieval <b>Umkehr</b> <b>method</b> to estimate the vertical distribution of ozone was updated using a statistical approach to the mathematical inversion scheme. The vertical ozone profile covariance matrix {{was used as a}} priori information for the inverse problem. A new method of the ozonesonde data organization according to air mass types helped to improve the covariance matrix quality. A retrieval method was developed using eigenvector technique. An optimal vertical ozone profile resolution was determined from the mathematical inversion scheme analysis based on the same technique. The sun radiation transfer was accounted for multiple scattering and atmospheric sphericity in this calculation. The retrievals using actual Umkehr Dobson spectrophotometer observations were also performed to provide the comparison of the standard and updated methods with concurrent ozone sound data at Boulder U. S. The comparison has revealed that the present method has some advantages in both resolution and accuracy, as compared to the standard one, especially for the atmospheric layers below ozone maximum...|$|E
40|$|A {{retrieval}} {{method was}} developed to estimate the solar backscatter ultraviolet (SBUV) satellite albedo for the ozone profiler wavelengths using ground-based ultraviolet measurements. For the present investigation the Umkehr {{was used as the}} ground-based ultraviolet measurement. Simulated SBUV data and Umkehr data theoretically computed from a priori ozone profiles observed by the SAGE II satellite were used to develop the retrieval algorithm and to test its capability. The test indicated that albedos for the SBUV ozone profiler wavelengths should allow estimates to a precision of +/- 5 percent or better, depending on the accuracy of the ultraviolet measurement. Retrievals using actual Umkehr observations were also performed to provide a preliminary look at the magnitude and annual variation of retrieved albedos. A case study was performed, comparing retrieved albedos with SBUV-measured albedos. The SBUV albedo change was seen to be approximately twice as large as the albedo changes estimated by the <b>Umkehr</b> <b>method.</b> Results of the investigation suggest that the method of estimation may be useful for determining the drift rate of the SBUV calibration...|$|E
40|$|From an {{examination}} of the agreements and differences between different satellite instruments, it is difficult to believe that existing satellite instruments determine upper stratospheric ozone much better than 4 pct.; by extension, it probably would require at least a 4 pct. change to be reliably detected as a change. The best estimates of the vertical profiles of ozone change in the upper stratosphere between 1979 and 1986 are judged to be those given by the two SAGE satellite instruments. SAGE- 2 minus SAGE- 1 gives a much lower ozone reduction than that given by the archived Solar Backscatter UV data. The average SAGE profiles of ozone changes between 20 and 50 degs north and between 20 and 50 degs south are given. The SAGE- 1 and SAGE- 2 comparison gives an ozone reduction of about 4 pct. at 25 km over temperate latitudes. Five ground based Umkehr stations between 36 and 52 degs north, corrected for the effects of volcanic aerosols, report an ozone reduction between 1979 and 1987 at Umkehr layer 8 of 9 + or - 5 pct. The central estimate of upper stratospheric ozone reduction given by SAGE at 40 km is less than the central value estimated by the <b>Umkehr</b> <b>method</b> at layer 8...|$|E
40|$|Total ozone (TO 3) {{and ozone}} {{vertical}} profile (by the <b>Umkehr</b> <b>method)</b> have been measured at Belsk (51. 84 &#x 00 B 0;N, 20. 78 &#x 00 B 0;E), Poland, since March 1963. The monthly mean data are analysed {{for the long-term}} changes in the period 1975 &#x 2013; 1996 and 1997 &#x 2013; 2012, that is, in the increasing and decreasing phases of the ozone-depleting substances (ODS) concentration in the mid-altitude stratosphere over the NH mid-latitudes. Standard explanatory variables are selected for the ozone variability attribution to chemical and dynamical processes. A triad of regression models with various formulae for the trend term is examined to get a synergetic effect. The trend term could be: (1) proportional to ODS, (2) piecewise linear (with the turning points in 1975 &#x 2013; the trend onset and in 1997 &#x 2013; the trend overturning), (3) represented by any smooth curve fitted to the ozone time series having &#x 2018;natural variations&#x 2019; removed. Confirming the results from previous studies on the midlatitudinal ozone, the analyses show a weakening of the TO 3 trend and the statistically significant positive trend in the upper stratospheric region (33 &#x 2013; 43 &#x 2009;km) since 1997. The TO 3 depletion in summer and autumn for the period 1997 &#x 2013; 2012 {{is found in the}} Umkehr data due to the ozone decrease in the lower and mid-stratosphere. A novel statistical-simulation-based test is proposed. It uses the bootstrap sample of the smooth trend pattern to calculate statistical significance of hypotheses for the trend variability.

The evaluation was basically restricted to ozone absorption cross-sections in the UV range with particular focus on the Huggins band. Up until now, the data of Bass and Paur published in 1985 (BP, 1985) are still officially recommended for such measurements. During the last decade it became obvious that BP (1985) cross-section data have deficits for use in advanced space-borne ozone measurements. At the same time, it was recognized that the origin of systematic differences in ground-based measurements of ozone required further investigation, in particular whether the BP (1985) cross-section data might contribute to these differences. In ACSO, different sets of laboratory ozone absorption cross-section data (including their dependence on temperature) of the group of Reims (France) and, 1992, 1995, abbreviated as BDM, 1995) and those of [8], and [7], (abbreviated as SER, 2014) were examined for use in atmospheric ozone measurements in the Huggins band. In conclusion, ACSO recommends:- The spectroscopic data of BP (1985) should no longer be used for retrieval of atmospheric ozone measurements. - For retrieval of ground-based instruments of total ozone and ozone profile measurements by the <b>Umkehr</b> <b>method</b> performed by Brewer and Dobson instruments data of SER (2014) are recommended to be used.
