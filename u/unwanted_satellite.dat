40|$|The CLIC Test Facility 3 (CTF 3), {{built at}} CERN by an {{international}} collaboration, aims at demonstrating the feasibility of the CLIC scheme by 2010. The CTF 3 drive beam generation scheme relies {{on the use of}} a fast phase switch of a sub-harmonic bunching system in order to phase-code the bunches. The amount of charge in <b>unwanted</b> <b>satellite</b> bunches is an important quantity, which must be minimized. Beam dynamic simulations have been used to study the problem, showing the limitation of the present CTF 3 design and the gain of potential upgrades. In this paper the results are discussed and compared with beam measurements taken during the first operation of the system...|$|E
40|$|In the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) the RF {{power for}} the {{acceleration}} of the Main Beam is extracted from a high-current Drive Beam that runs parallel to the main linac. The main feasibility issues of the two-beam acceleration scheme are being demonstrated at CLIC Test Facility 3 (CTF 3). The CTF 3 Drive Beam injector consists of a thermionic gun followed by the bunching system and two accelerating structures all embedded in solenoidal magnetic field and a magnetic chicane. Three sub-harmonic bunchers (SHB), a prebuncher and a travelling wave buncher constitute the bunching system. The phase coding process done by the sub-harmonic bunching system produces <b>unwanted</b> <b>satellite</b> bunches between the successive main bunches. The beam dynamics of the CTF 3 Drive Beam injector is reoptimised {{with the goal of}} improving the injector performance and in particular decreasing the satellite population, the beam loss in the magnetic chicane and the beam emittance in transverse plane compare to the original model based on P.

40|$|AbstractIn the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) the RF {{power for}} the {{acceleration}} of the Main Beam is extracted from a high-current Drive Beam that runs parallel to the main linac. The longitudinal and transverse beam dynamics of the Drive Beam injector has been studied in detail and optimized. The injector consists of a thermionic gun followed by a bunching system, some accelerating structures, and a magnetic chicane. The bunching system contains three sub-harmonic bunchers, a prebuncher, and a traveling wave buncher all embedded in a solenoidal magnetic field. The main characteristic of the Drive Beam injector is the phase coding process done by the sub-harmonic bunching system operating at half the acceleration frequency. This process {{is essential for the}} frequency multiplication of the Drive Beam. During the phase coding process the <b>unwanted</b> <b>satellite</b> bunches are produced that adversely affects the machine power efficiency. The main challenge is to reduce the population of particles in the satellite bunches in the presence of strong space-charge forces due to the high beam current. The simulation of the beam dynamics has been carried out with parmela with the goal of optimizing the injector performance compared to the existing model studied for the Conceptual Design Report (CDR). The emphasis of the optimization was on decreasing the satellite population, the beam loss in the magnetic chicane and limiting the beam emittance growth in transverse plane...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{investigates the}} usage of {{established}} interference cancellation techniques applied to the simultaneous reception of geostationary satellite broadcast signals from two or more satellites. In particular the reduction of interference from adjacent satellites is of interest, which would allow a reduction of the antenna size and the requirements on the directivity of the installation. The rejection of <b>unwanted</b> adjacent <b>satellite</b> interferers can imply a large equivalent parabolic reflector size to achieve the required spatial separation of the signals. The usage of small and cheap reception antennas at the end-user premises can be facilitated by {{the reduction of the}} requirements on the antenna characteristics in terms of adjacent satellite interference rejection, in particular for the joint reception of signals from two or more simultaneous geostationary orbital locations. In this study the novel approach of using simple decision directed interference reduction techniques at the symbol detection level is considered to relax the requirements on the reception system front-end...|$|R
40|$|Over nine {{thousand}} {{satellites and}} other large objects are currently in orbit around the Earth, along with many smaller particles. As the low Earth orbit is not a limitless resource, some sort of debris mitigation measures are needed {{to solve the problem}} of unusable satellites and spent upper stages. It has been suggested that every satellite deployed should carry extra propellant to bring it down once completed its mission. On the other hand, electrodynamic tethers, potentially able to rapidly remove <b>unwanted</b> <b>satellites</b> and upper stages from low Earth orbits with a low mass requirement, have been recently proposed as an alternative solution. Nevertheless, electrodynamic tethers introduce unusual problems when viewed from the space debris perspective. In particular, because of their small diameter, tethers of normal design may have a high probability of being severed by impacts with relatively small meteoroids and orbital debris. The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) recognized this demanding task and a new action item (AI 19. 1) was opened, in 2001, to investigate the potential benefits and risks of using tethers in space. This action item was successively focused on electrodynamic tethers to de-orbit spacecraft, while a study proposal was addressed to assess the tethers survivability concerns. The institute ISTI of the Italian National Research Council (CNR), together with the Kyushu University, in Japan, and NASA participated in the IADC study. Different models and techniques were developed and applied to compute the fatal impact rate of meteoroids and orbital debris on space tethers in circular orbits, at different altitudes and inclinations, as well as to assess the survival probability of electrodynamic tether systems during some baseline de-orbiting missions. This work compares the results obtained at ISTI with those computed at the Kyushu University and NASA concerning the vulnerability to debris impacts of a specific electrodynamic tether during some typical de-orbiting missions. Besides the single line tether design, double line solutions were analysed as well to reduce the tether vulnerability. The orbital debris and meteoroid fluxes models adopted included ORDEM 2000, MASTER 2001, DAS 1. 5. 3 and Grun 1985. The results obtained were similar for a single line tether, confirming that the survivability concern is fully justified and that no de-orbiting mission, from the altitudes and inclinations considered, is possible if the tether diameter is smaller than a few millimetres. The survival probability may significantly increase for a double line configuration with a sufficiently high number of loops. The results strongly depend on the debris environment model adopted. The more pessimistic results were obtained with ORDEM 2000. The MASTER 2001 and DAS 1. 5. 3 fluxes resulted in comparable survival probabilities higher than ORDEM 2000...|$|R
40|$|A new photo-injector, capable {{to deliver}} a long pulse train with a high charge per bunch for CTF 3, has been {{designed}} and installed by a collaboration between LAL, CCLRC and CERN {{within the framework of}} the second Joint Research Activity PHIN of the European CARE program. The demonstration of the high charge and the stability along the pulse train are the important goals for CTF 3 and the CLIC drive beam. The nominal beam for CTF 3 has an average current of 3. 5 A, a 1. 5 GHz bunch repetation frequency and a pulse length of 1. 27 μs (1908 bunches). The existing CTF 3 injector consists of a thermionic gun and a subharmonic bunching system. The PHIN photo-injector is being tested in a dedicated test-stand at CERN to replace the existing CTF 3 injector that is producing <b>unwanted</b> <b>satellite</b> bunches during the bunching process. A phase-coding scheme is planned to be implemented to the PHIN laser system providing the required beam temporal structure by CTF 3. RF photo-injectors are high-brightness, low-emittance electron sources. One of the main beam dynamics issues for a high brightness electron source, is the optimization of beam envelope behavior in the presence of the space charge force in order to control the beam emittance. Beam based measurements, such as single shot emittance measurement with a multi-slit configuration, have been performed during the commissioning runs in 2008 and 2009. In this work the photo-injector will be describe d and the first beam test results will be presented and compared with simulations...|$|E
