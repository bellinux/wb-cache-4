Environmental justice researchers, with substantial experience in addressing racial and ethnic inequities in environmental risk from technological and other hazards, should consider similar inequities in risky substance <b>use</b> <b>environments</b> as an environmental justice issue.

5000|$|The {{underlying}} {{fault with}} all {{lead acid batteries}} is the requirement for an excessively long charge time arising from a two-stage process: bulk charge and float charge. All lead acid batteries, irrespective of type, are quick to charge to 70% of capacity within 2 or 3 hours, but require another 9 to 10 hours to [...] "float charge" [...] after the initial charge. If users fail to float charge, battery capacity is dramatically reduced. All types of batteries have a [...] "memory" [...] in that every time a user charges to less than 100% charge, battery capacity is shortened. A lead acid battery could reach 4,600 cycles if it were kept on a shelf and kept at the right state of charge. To ensure a life of 8 years, a lead acid battery should be kept at full charge when stored (or dry), and, when working, kept at depth of discharge of less than 20%. In addition, its discharge rate should be not {{more than three hours}} and its charge rate should be not more than three hours (C0.333), and it should be float charged properly. With less careful use, a lifetime of two to three years or 700-800 cycles might be expected, dependent upon the <b>use</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction. This article {{results from}} a {{qualitative}} study of 1) information behavior in community problem-solving framed as a distributed information <b>use</b> <b>environment</b> and 2) approaches used by a best-practice library to anticipate information needs associated with community problem solving. Method. Several approaches to data collection were used - focus groups, interviews, observation of community and library meetings, and analysis of supporting documents. We focused first on the information behaviour of community groups. Finding that the library supported these activities we sought to understand its approach. Analysis. Data were coded thematically for both information behaviour concepts and themes germane to problem-solving activity. A grounded theory approach was taken to capture aspects of the library staff's practice. Themes evolved from the data; supporting documentation - reports, articles and library communication - was also coded. Results. The study showed 1) how information <b>use</b> <b>environment</b> components (people, setting, problems, problem resolutions) combine in this distributed information <b>use</b> <b>environment</b> to determine specific information needs and uses; and 2) how the library contributed to the viability of this distributed information <b>use</b> <b>environment.</b> Conclusion. Community problem solving, here explicated as a distributed IUE, {{is likely to be}} seen in multiple communities. The library model presented demonstrates that by reshaping its information practice within the framework of an information <b>use</b> <b>environment,</b> a library can anticipate community information needs as they are generated and where they are most relevant...|$|E
