2500|$|It was {{not until}} Universal {{executive}} Sidney Sheinberg suggested Scheider, that Friedkin finally managed to employ an actor for the leading role of Jackie Scanlon. They had previously worked on The French Connection together; however, they had lost contact after Friedkin—at William Peter Blatty's insistence—had refused to cast Scheider as Father Karras in The Exorcist. With Universal unenthusiastic about the project, acquiring Scheider, who had recently enjoyed enormous success in Steven Spielberg's Jaws, made the studio more hopeful and inclined to let the film materialize. Production notes on the 1998 <b>Universal</b> <b>DVD</b> release tell a different story, noting that the casting of Scheider as Scanlon/Dominguez was a [...] "foregone conclusion" [...] and [...] "the ideal (perhaps the only) choice for the role" [...] since Friedkin had directed him previously in The French Connection. After casting Scheider in the main role, Lino Ventura refused to take second billing to him. On the other hand, the actor chosen by Friedkin to replace Ventura {{turned out to be}} Bruno Cremer, who, among other pictures prior to Sorcerer, had played in Costa-Gavras's Section spéciale and whom Friedkin described as a [...] "good actor". The only actor who was Friedkin's original choice was the French-Moroccan Amidou, who played the Palestinian terrorist, Kassem. Friedkin was so impressed with his performance in Claude Lelouch's La Vie, l'amour, la mort (released in 1968) that he wrote down his name immediately upon seeing the movie, expecting to collaborate with him one day.|$|E

Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features.As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with a built-in FireWire port.Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video. The initial release of the Apple TV used {{a modified version of}} Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services. On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, {{with the exception of the}} Intel release dropping support for the Classic environment.Only PowerPC Macs can be booted from retail copies of the Tiger client DVD, but there is a <b>Universal</b> <b>DVD</b> of Tiger Server 10.4.7 (8K1079) that can boot both PowerPC and Intel Macs.|$|E
50|$|Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was {{initially}} {{available in a}} PowerPC edition, with an Intel edition released beginning at Mac OS X 10.4.4 Tiger. There is no universal version of the client operating system, although Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger Server was made available on a <b>universal</b> <b>DVD</b> from version Mac OS X 10.4.7 Tiger. While Apple shipped the PowerPC edition bundled with PowerPC-based Macs and also sold it as a separate retail box, {{the only way to}} obtain the Intel version was to buy an Intel-based Mac bundled with it. However, it was possible to buy the ‘restore’ DVDs containing the Intel version through unofficial channels such as eBay, and officially through Apple if you could provide proof of purchase of the appropriate Intel Mac. These grey colored ‘restore’ DVDs supplied with new Macs, are designed to only restore on the model of Mac that they are intended for. However, they can be modified to work on any Intel Mac. The retail PowerPC-only DVD can be used on any PowerPC-based Mac supported by Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.|$|E
