40|$|The {{permissible}} {{sound level}} of road vehicles {{is part of the}} EU vehicle type approval legislation, as laid down in EU Directive 70 / 157 /EEC [1] and in the <b>UN-ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> No 51 [2], which specifies the test method for the noise emission test. Since 1984 several studies [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] showed that the test method, that had been in force with amendments since 1970, did no longer reflect the real life driving behaviour in urban traffic. In particular the contribution of tyre rolling noise to the total noise emission was underestimated in the test method. This fact was stated in official documents (e. g. the Green paper concerning the Future Noise Policy – 1996 [39]) {{and the development of a}} revised test method started in ISO TC 43 WG 42 “Measurement of noise emission (external) from road vehicles”. This resulted in 2007 in a new version of the standard ISO 362 [4]. The UN-ECE GRB (Groupe Rapporteur Bruit = Working Party on Noise) has published a new test method in 2007 based on the revised ISO standard with the purpose to monitor the application of this new method in parallel with the existing test method and to evaluate the qualities of the new method. During a period of three years the new method has been used for monitoring purposes. The monitoring period under <b>UN-ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> No 51 lasted from 1 July 2007 until 1 July 2009, while the monitoring period under Directive 2007 / 34 /EC [3] started on 6 July 2008 and expired on 6 July 2010. During the monitoring periods the results of the current and of the new test method were submitted to the European Commission. By this procedure a database of parallel test results has been collected that offers a good opportunity to investigate the qualities of the new method and to quantify the differences between the results of the two methods. At the request of the European Commission, DG Enterprise and Industry, Unit Automotive Industry, TNO has executed a study into the differences between the current type approval test method A and the proposed new test method B. The goal of the study was to “assess the available noise data in relation to the draft new test protocol and to provide possible new limit values for each category of vehicles, as well as for the derogations currently granted for certain types of vehicles. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the FIMCAR (Frontal Impact and Compatibility Assessment Research) project are to answer the remaining open questions identified in earlier projects (such as understanding of {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of force based metrics and barrier deformation based metrics, confirmation of specific compatibility issues such as structural interaction, investigation of force matching) and to finalise the frontal impact test procedures required to assess compatibility. Research strategies and priorities were based on earlier research programs and the FIMCAR accident data analysis. The identified real world safety issues were used to develop a list of compatibility characteristics which were then prioritised within the consortium. This list was the basis for evaluating the different test candidates. This analysis resulted in the combination of the Full Width Deformable Barrier test (FWDB) with compatibility metrics and the existing Offset Deformable Barrier (ODB) as described in <b>UN-ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> 94 with additional cabin integrity requirement as being proposed as the FIMCAR assessment approach. The proposed frontal impact assessment approach addresses many of the issues identified by the FIMCAR consortium but not all frontal impact and compatibility issues could be addressed...|$|E
40|$|According to the German {{road traffic}} {{regulations}} children up {{to the age of}} 12 or a body height below 150 cm have to use approved and appropriate child restraint systems (CRS). CRS must be approved according to <b>UN-ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> No. 44. The regulation classifies CRS in 5 body weight categories. The upper weight group is approved for children from 22 to 36 kg. However, studies show that already today many children weigh more than 36 kg although they have not reached a size of 150 cm. Therefore, no ECE R 44 approved CRS is available for these "overweight " children. In conclusion, today’s sizes and weights of children are no longer represented by the current version of the ECE R 44. The heaviest used dummy (P 10) weighs just 32. 6 kg and has a body height of 137. 9 cm. Statistical data of German children show that already 5 % of the children at a size of 137. 9 cm have a body weight above 45. 3 kg. Regarding children at a body height of 145 cm, the 95 th percentile limit is at a weight of 53. 3 kg. Based on these data 4 dummies with different heights and weights were defined and produced. Two of them are “overweight”. Up to now, there is no experience how current child restraint systems perform in a car crash if they are used by children with a body weight above 36 kg and a size smaller than 150 cm. In the future, different child restraint systems will be tested with respect to the ECE R 44 regulation using these “overweight ” dummies...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of safety belts in the passengers’ seats of coaches could have important repercussions increasing their safety under frontal impact and rollover. This type of vehicles has a particularity from cars or trucks: the safety belts are fixed {{directly to the}} seats {{and not to the}} vehicle structures. A lot of work has been made in Europe (and it is being made) to define requirements for seats, seats’ anchorages, restraint systems and safety belts’ anchorages to guarantee the correct retention of the passengers in their seats under frontal impacts. In case of rollover, the belted passengers increase the energy that must be absorbed by the superstructure because some of their mass must be considered us rigidly joined to the vehicle. This situation has been taking into account in the current European legislation (<b>Regulation</b> <b>UN-ECE</b> 66, Revision 01). This version of the Regulation has increased the requirements for the superstructure to assure that the behaviour of the superstructure is as good as in the vehicles without belted passengers preserving the survival space. This new revision is going to be mandatory for new types from October 2010 (and for new matriculations from October 2017), but a considerable number of coaches’ manufactures are modifying their structures under this new revision because they take in mind that if the safety belts are yet included in the coaches, the superstructure must be in accordance. This is an important effort of redesign: more resistant structures but without weight increase...|$|R
40|$|The off-set {{assessment}} procedure potentially {{contributes to the}} FIMCAR objectives to maintain the compartment strength and to assess load spreading in frontal collisions. Furthermore it provides the opportunity to assess the restraint system performance with different pulses if combined with a full-width {{assessment procedure}} in the frontal assessment approach. Originally {{it was expected that}} the PDB assessment procedure would be selected for the FIMCAR assessment approach. However, {{it was not possible to}} deliver a compatibility metric in time so that the current off-set procedure (ODB as used in UNECE R 94) with some minor modifications was proposed for the FIMCAR Assessment Approach. Nevertheless the potential to assess load spreading, which appears not to be possible with any other assessed frontal impact assessment procedure was considered to be still high. Therefore the development work for the PDB assessment procedure did not stop with the decision not to select the PDB procedure. As a result of the decisions to use the current ODB and to further develop the PDB procedure, both are covered within this deliverable. The deliverable describes the off-set test procedure that will be recommended by FIMCAR consortium, this corresponds to the ODB test as it is specified in <b>UN-ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> 94 (R 94), i. e. EEVC deformable element with 40 % overlap at a test speed of 56 km/h. In addition to the current R 94 requirements, FIMCAR will recommend to introduce some structural requirements which will guarantee sufficiently strong occupant compartments by enforcing the stability of the forward occupant cell. With respect to the PDB assessment procedure a new metric, Digital Derivative in Y direction - DDY, was developed, described, analysed, and compared with other metrics. The DDY metric analyses the deformation gradients laterally across the PDB face. The more even the deformation, the lower the DDY values and the better the metric’s result. In order analyse the different metrics, analysis of the existing PDB test results and the results of the performed simulation studies was performed. In addition, an assessment of artificial deformation profiles with the metrics took place. This analysis shows that there are still issues with the DDY metric but it appears that it is possible to solve them with future optimisations. For example the current metric assesses only the area within 60 % of the half vehicle width. For vehicles that have the longitudinals further outboard, the metric is not effective. In addition to the metric development, practical issues of the PDB tests such as the definition of a scan procedure for the analysis of the deformation pattern including the validation of the scanning procedure by the analysis of 3 different scans at different locations of the same barrier were addressed. Furthermore the repeatability and reproducibility of the PDB was analysed. The barrier deformation readings seem to be sensitive with respect to the impact accuracy. In total, the deliverable is meant to define the FIMCAR off-set assessment procedure and to be a starting point for further development of the PDB assessment procedure...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} FIMCAR (Frontal Impact and Compatibility Assessment Research) {{project was}} to propose a frontal impact {{assessment}} approach addressing self- and partner protection. Research strategies and priorities were based on earlier research programs and the FIMCAR accident data analysis looking at modern cars. The identified real world safety issues – such as structural interaction (especially under-/override), high acceleration loading of the occupant especially in large overlap accidents and insufficient horizontal and vertical load spreading were used for evaluating the different test candidates. In addition to the issues mentioned above, the FIMCAR accident analysis suggested that frontal force compartment integrity matching is less of an issue as originally expected. FIMCAR developed a car-to-car test program that investigated the performance of vehicle structures. Results of the test program show {{that the presence of}} a lower load path contributes to a more robust performance of the vehicle. The rearward offset of a lower load path could be reviewed and used to quantify when a lower structure design can contribute to structural interaction in both frontal and side impact configurations. In addition to the car crash test programme, numerical models of actual cars and barriers were developed and used. As car-to-car simulations with models of different car manufacturers are almost impossible because of confidentiality, Parametric Car Models (PCM) and Generic Car Models (GCM) were developed. Due to the parametric design of the PCMs it is possible to modify the models in an easy and fast way. The GCMs model virtual cars which represent an average real car of the respective category in a comparable way to the OEM models. Within the FIMCAR project, different frontal impact test candidates were analysed regarding their potential for future frontal impact legislation. The research activities focused on car-to-car frontal impact. Test procedures were developed with both a crash test programme and numerical simulations. This analysis resulted in the combination of the Full Width Deformable Barrier test (FWDB) with compatibility metrics and the existing Offset Deformable Barrier (ODB) as described in <b>UN-ECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> 94 with additional cabin integrity requirement as being proposed as the FIMCAR assessment approach. The advantages of the FWDB compared to the rigid wall are the more representative pulse and deformation pattern as well as the better assessment of load paths. The introduction of a (M) PDB without compatibility metrics (that FIMCAR was unable to deliver in time) was considered as not being appropriate. The proposed frontal impact assessment approach addresses many of the issues identified by the FIMCAR consortium (impact alignment, high acceleration pulse loading, maintenance of compartment strength requirements, etc.) but not all frontal impact and compatibility issues could be addressed (load spreading). A benefit analysis estimated the benefit of the following three options: no change, introduction of full width test with compatibility assessment in addition to current ECE R 94 and introduction of full width test with compatibility assessment and replacement of current ODB test by PDB test with load spreading metric. The comparison of calculated break even costs for option 2 with estimated costs for achieving the benefit from previous projects suggests a positive cost benefit ratio.
