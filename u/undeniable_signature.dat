40|$|Abstract. <b>Undeniable</b> <b>signatures</b> were {{proposed}} {{to limit the}} verification property of ordinary digital signatures. In fact, the verification of such signatures cannot be attained {{without the help of}} the signer, via the confirmation/denial protocols. Later, the concept was refined to give the possibility of converting a selected signature into an ordinary one, or publishing a universal receipt that turns all <b>undeniable</b> <b>signatures</b> publicly verifiable. In this paper, we present the first generic construction for convertible <b>undeniable</b> <b>signatures</b> from certain weakly secure cryptosystems and any secure digital signature scheme. Next, we give two specific approaches for building convertible <b>undeniable</b> <b>signatures</b> from a large class of pairingbased signatures. These methods find a nice and practical instantiation with known encryption and signature schemes. For instance, we achieve the most efficient <b>undeniable</b> <b>signatures</b> with regard to the signature length and cost, the underlying assumption and the security model. We believe these constructions could be an interesting starting point to develop more efficient schemes or give better security analyses of the existing ones.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is on the design and {{analysis}} of <b>undeniable</b> <b>signature</b> schemes in certiﬁcate-free settings, namely, identity-based setting and certiﬁcateless setting. <b>Undeniable</b> <b>signature</b> is a special type of digital signatures which is not universally veriﬁable. Identity-based cryptography overcomes the costly issues in traditional public key cryptography by computing the users’ public keys directly from their publicly available information. However, identity-based systems suffer from an inherent private key escrow problem. Certiﬁcateless cryptography was later proposed to bridge between identity-based cryptography and traditional public key cryptography by eliminating the use of certiﬁcates while addressing the private key escrow problem at the same time. Firstly, two attacks are mounted on an efﬁcient identity-based <b>undeniable</b> <b>signature</b> scheme. A provably secure and efﬁcient identity-based <b>undeniable</b> <b>signature</b> scheme with short signature is then proposed. Secondly, cryptanalysis is presented on a newly proposed efﬁcient certiﬁcateless <b>undeniable</b> <b>signature</b> scheme. More precisely, security ﬂaws are found on the invisibility and non-impersonation properties of the scheme. A revised scheme is then proffered which tackles both of the attacks while enjoys from an equally efﬁcient Sign algorithm. Independently, a provably secure certiﬁcateless <b>undeniable</b> <b>signature</b> scheme which is more efﬁcient than the only existing scheme that is secure in the strong security model is proposed. Lastly, in our effort in proposing certiﬁcateless <b>undeniable</b> <b>signature</b> schemes with additional features, the security model of convertible certiﬁcateless <b>undeniable</b> <b>signature</b> schemes is formally deﬁned and an instance of such schemes is presented for the ﬁrst time...|$|E

However, the public verifiability of digital signatures may have undesirable consequences when manipulating sensitive and private information. <b>Undeniable</b> <b>signatures,</b> whose verification requires the cooperation of the signer in an interactive way, were invented due to such considerations. Whereafter, designated confirmer signatures (DCS) were introduced as an improved cryptographic primitive when the signer becomes unavailable in <b>undeniable</b> <b>signatures.</b> This thesis is mainly devoted to the modelling, design and analysis of designated confirmer signatures. By exploiting the existing security notions, we theoretically analyse the relations among unimpersonation, invisibility, non-transferability and transcript-simulatability. To this end, we develop formal proofs to demonstrate the implications of those properties. After providing the theoretical results related to the security model, we develop both concrete and generic DCS constructions that adapts to a full verification setting. On one hand, by supporting the signer’s ability to disavow, we can achieve an efficient designated confirmer signature by using bilinear maps, and such a construction is secure in the random oracle model under a new computational assumption.
