40|$|Abstract A {{numerical}} model developed to simulate stable and unstable flows in unsaturated porous media is described. Results of numerical studies {{carried out to}} simulate laboratory experiments with the assumption of stable flow demonstrate the occurrence of unstable flow for the initial conditions of both air dry and field capacity for unsaturated infiltration in sands. This indicates that the Richards flow equation based on moisture content and potential variables averaged over total crosssectional area may not be applicable for flow under instability-prone boundary conditions. The unstable flow due to wetting front instability is modelled using the steady-state theory proposed by Hillel & Baker (1988). Simulation results for fingered flux calculated with the theory represent the experimental data reasonably well. The pore water velocity remains constant irrespective of the incident flux {{as long as the}} flux is smaller than the hydraulic conductivity value at the water entry suction of the porous media. The effect of antecedent wetness on the <b>unstable</b> <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour</b> is to reduce the pore water velocity drastically from air dry to field capacity conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of a confined flow field generated through two separated injecting walls carried out by studying {{the effect of a}} mass flow rate difference between the two walls. Such a parameter has been found {{to play a major role}} in <b>unstable</b> <b>flow</b> field <b>behaviour.</b> Concretely speaking, we have identified two vortex shedding phenomena, i. e; the main flow and the wall vortex shedding phenomena. Results clearly show that when the mass flow rate is increased at the second injecting wall, wall vortex coherence is enhanced and impinging of such structures forces a coupling phenomenon to develop between flow field dynamics and acoustics. On the other hand, only a 15 % mass flow rate difference of the first injecting block is sufficient to prevent such coupling between acoustics and vortex shedding phenomenon. Consequently, the resonance phenomenon is pronouncedly weakened and significant oscillation reduction is achieved...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{pneumatic}} conveying performance of granular {{materials in the}} transition zone between dilute- phase and dense-phase still lacks full understanding and assessment, especially the mechanism {{for the formation of}} <b>unstable</b> <b>flow,</b> tests have been carried out on poly pellets (particle diameter = 4. 7 mm, particle density = 897 kg/m 3) and two different stainless steel pipelines (60. 3 and 98. 4 mm ID, each 21 m long). By careful observation and analysis of <b>flow</b> <b>behaviours</b> (covering dilute-phase, <b>unstable</b> zone and low-velocity slug-flow), five different flow modes (as the air velocity is decreased) : fully suspended flow; strand flow; stable or <b>unstable</b> strand <b>flow</b> over a stationary layer for low solid mass flow rates; strand flow over a slowly moving bed for high solid mass flow rates; low-velocity slug-flow are identified. The mechanism involved in the formation of unstable zone was explored...|$|R
40|$|Invar 36 samples {{have been}} {{fabricated}} by {{selective laser melting}} at a constant laser power but with varied laser scanning speeds. Some samples were further heat treated or hot isostatically pressed (HIPed). The obtained microstructures were studied using optical and electron microscopes, X-ray diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction techniques and the properties evaluated through both tensile testing and thermal expansion measurement. It {{was found that the}} as-fabricated samples show very low porosity (< 0. 5 %) when the laser scanning speeds are below 3200 mm/s but show remarkably increased porosity above 3200 mm/s (at 400 W). Increased scanning speed also led to increasingly irregular-shaped laser scanned tracks together with an increased number of pores on sample surfaces and keyhole features within the samples, all indicative of increasingly <b>unstable</b> melt <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The as-fabricated microstructure was dominated by columnar γ grains decorated by nanosized α precipitates, resulting in development of texture. Heat treatment did not change microstructure significantly while HIPing closed the majority of pores but also caused pronounced coarsening of α precipitates especially those located at grain boundaries during subsequent slow cooling. With the presence of elongated pores, the vertically built samples were found to show much lower elongation than horizontally built samples while in the absence of pores their ductility has been significantly improved but their tensile strengths are still lower than the latter. The vertically built samples generally failed in a transgranular mode while the horizontally built samples failed in an intergranular mode. HIPing greatly degraded tensile properties due to the presence of coarse grain boundary α precipitates weakening the bonding between grains. Irrespective of building orientations, the as-fabricated samples show low coefficients of thermal expansion below 300 °C comparable to conventionally manufactured Invar 36...|$|R
40|$|Severe {{slugging}} and <b>unstable</b> <b>flow</b> in an S-Shaped riser {{has been}} investigated in three research themes - experiments, criterion modelling and transient code modelling. A series of experiments were carried out on the Cranfield University Three Phase Facility and Riser Rig using a 10 m high riser over the pressure range 2, 4 and 7 bar(a). The collected information was used to characterise the <b>unstable</b> <b>flows</b> in terms of pressure cycling, riser liquid inventory and fluid production characteristics. From analysis of the <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour,</b> {{it was found that}} in terms of slug characteristics, transitional severe slugging and oscillation flows are as potentially problematic as `classical' severe slugging. This is due to the magnitude of peak flow in excess of the average fluid throughput in the riser {{and the size of the}} liquid slugs generated. A criterion for the occurrence of <b>unstable</b> <b>flows</b> in an S-Shaped riser was developed based upon considerations of bubble penetration at the riser base. This proved to be successful at predicting the experimental results from this work and an independent source. Comparisons were made between the experimental results and a transient code. The code could predict the occurrence of `classical' severe slugging however the detailed characteristics of the experiments were not predicted by the code. The results for transitional severe slugging and oscillation flow showed further differences between the code prediction and the experiments. Drawing all simulation results together it was concluded that the prediction of pipeline behaviour and the propagation of flow regimes local to the riser base and in the curved riser pipe were significant sources of error in the simulation...|$|R

40|$|We {{present results}} from a {{computational}} study of predictability in fully-developed baroclinically <b>unstable</b> laboratory <b>flows.</b> This <b>behaviour</b> is studied in the Met Office/Oxford Rotating Annulus Laboratory Simulation – {{a model of the}} classic rotating annulus laboratory experiment with differentially heated cylindrical sidewalls, which is firmly established as an insightful laboratory analogue for certain kinds of atmospheric dynamical behaviour. This work is the first study of "predictability of the first kind" in the annulus experiment. We devise an ensemble prediction scheme using the breeding method to study the predictability of the annulus in the perfect model scenario. This scenario allows one simulation to be defined as the true state, against which all forecasts are measured. We present results from forecasts over a range of quasi-periodic and chaotic annulus flow regimes. A number of statistical and meteorological techniques are used to compare the predictability of these flows: bred vector growth rate and dimension, error variance, "spaghetti plots", probability forecasts, Brier score, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. These techniques gauge both the predictability of the flow and the performance of the ensemble relative to a forecast using a climatological distribution. It is found that in the perfect model scenario, the two quasi-periodic regimes examined may be indefinitely predictable. The two chaotic regimes (structural vacillation and period doubled amplitude vacillation) show a loss of predictability on a timescale of hundreds to thousands of seconds (65 – 280 annulus rotation periods, or 1 – 3 Lyapunov times) ...|$|R

40|$|Different {{types of}} sludge (primary, {{secondary}} and digested) undergo mixing throughout the {{waste water treatment}} process. As such, its <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour</b> prior to and after mixing is altered dramatically. Although the <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour</b> of activated and digested sludge has been extensively studied, there is little knowledge on the <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour</b> of primary sludge as well as mixtures of {{the different types of}} sludge. This paper investigates the impact of different sludge types variation in the mixture on the <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the final blend. First, the <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour</b> of primary, secondary and digested sludge was studied over a wide total solids concentration (2. 8 to 9. 0 %TS). Next, the <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour</b> of mixtures of different types of sludge were studied over a wide volume fraction (0 - 1) and total solids concentration. The flow curves and apparent viscosity curves of primary, secondary and digested sludge at a similar total solids concentration (5, and 4. 2 % TS respectively) as well as mixtures of primary and secondary sludge (5 %TS) and mixtures of primary, secondary and digested sludge (4. 2 %TS) are presented. The flow curves and apparent viscosity curves of mixtures of different types of sludge demonstrate that the yield stress and apparent viscosity of the mixture depends on the particle interactions between the flocs. The flow curves were modelled using a dimensionless form of the Herschel bulkley model such that a master curve was developed for different types of sludge mixtures. In turn, the <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour</b> of any sludge could be predicted from the master curve...|$|R

40|$|Speed-flow {{relationships}} {{have traditionally been}} used to describe non-interrupted traffic operations on basic freeway segments. Such relationships typically show that when traffic flow is stable, speed reduces as traffic flow increases up to the maximum flow or capacity of the freeway. However, when traffic <b>flow</b> is <b>unstable,</b> the inverse of the above relationships is obtained. In this paper, an innovative approach to the traditional speed-flow relationship is discussed. It is shown that the traffic on freeways can be analysed in terms of travelling queues or platoons. The queue or platoon lengths are dependent on the traffic flow and it is therefore possible to develop queue length- flow relationships. Speeds {{can be related to}} the queue length and it is therefore possible to develop speed-queue relationships. The combination of these relationships provides the traditional speed-flow relationship. The advantage of the queuing approach is that {{it can be used to}} explain and clarify many of the operational characteristics of freeways. Queues or platoons form because of speed differentials between fast and slow vehicles. Faster vehicles therefore travel at lower speeds in these queues with the result that the average speed of the traffic stream reduces. Long queues create the problem that any disturbances along a freeway typically result in shock waves within the queues and in <b>unstable</b> <b>flow.</b> Various factors can contribute to such <b>unstable</b> <b>flows,</b> such as accidents and other incidents. Mostly, however, <b>unstable</b> <b>flow</b> occurs typically at interchanges where large volumes of traffic enter the freeway or where queues of traffic spill back from the interchange onto the freeway. <b>Unstable</b> <b>flow</b> can also occur on steep upgrades on which climbing lanes have not been provided. 1...|$|R

40|$|Reformulation of blended {{particulate}} materials {{has been}} always {{a problem for}} powder industry because formulators have difficulty in measuring, controlling and/or modifying the bulk flow properties of powders. A recently developed powder flow tester (PFT) by The Wolfson Centre for Bulk Solids Handling Technology, University of Greenwich is now available for industry to measure quickly and accurately the <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour</b> of single and blended particulate materials. This new powder flow tester helps to characterise quantitatively the blends which show good <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the industrial process lines and define the desirable standards for blends with poor <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour.</b> However, the current process of reformulation is basically a trial and error procedure based on the prior experience of the formulator with other blends reformulated. There is clearly a lack of practical understanding of the links between the particle and bulk scale of powders and how changes in the particle properties and/or blend compositions would affect the <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour</b> of blended powders. The aim of this research work was to develop an “empirical understanding” of the links between the particle properties and bulk flow properties in order to predict the bulk flow properties of blended powders based on changes to the particle properties or blend components.

The Coulter aperture {{is defined by}} a non-coaxial sheath of a conductive sample liquid that is surrounded on three sides by a non-conductive sheath liquid. The main advantage {{of this approach is}} that it prevents channel blocking, since the channel’s physical dimensions can be much larger than the Coulter aperture. Furthermore, the dimensions of the aperture can be dynamically adapted {{to the size of the}} particle by changing the flow-rates of the sample liquid and the sheath liquid. Both the sample and the sheath liquid are aqueous to prevent <b>unstable</b> <b>flow</b> conditions due to surface tension effects at the interface of the sheath liquid and the sample liquid. Diffusion of ions from the sample liquid into the sheath liquid is limited as long as a minimum flow-rate of 0. 5 l/s is used. The maximum flow-rate is determined by the occurrence of instable <b>flow</b> <b>behaviour</b> at flow-rates higher than 10 l/s. The device can be made in a simple process requiring only four lithographic steps.

This paper presents an analysis of flow stability in standpipes with gas counterflow, supported by small-scale experiments.
