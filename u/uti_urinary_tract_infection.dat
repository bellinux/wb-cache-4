Seventy nine children with urinary tract infection were divided into two groups based on the result of Tc- 99 m dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan: acute pyelonephritis (n= 33) and lower <b>UTI</b> (<b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection)</b> (n= 46) groups. White blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum C-reactive protein (CRP), PCT and IL- 1 β concentrations of both groups were measured and compared. WBC count, neutrophil count, ESR, serum CRP, PCT and IL- 1 β concentrations were higher in acute pyelonephritis patients than in the lower UTI group (P< 0. 05). The sensitivity and specificity of serum PCT and IL- 1 β for diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis were 31, 84. 7 % and 27. 2, 90 % respectively (using a cut-point value of 0. 5 ng/ml for PCT and 6. 9 pg/ml for IL- 1 β). The sensitivity of PCT and IL- 1 β for diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis was less than that of conventional markers such as ESR and CRP. This study revealed that serum PCT and IL- 1 β are not good biologic markers for differentiating acute pyelonephritis from lower UTI. It seems that conventional inflammatory markers such as ESR and CRP besides the clinical findings are more reliable for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>UTI</b> (<b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections)</b> {{represent}} a central pathology for a urological service. Antibiotic resistance {{is growing at}} a steady and alarming rate worldwide and especially in Romania. Method and materials: We have analyzed all the patients that were admitted to our clinic for continuous hospitalization between January 2015 and October 2015. All patients undergone urine culture and all cultures positive had an antibiogram worked up. We have selected all patients that had antibiotic resistance to at least an antibiotic. Results: From 1745 patients admitted for continuous hospitalization, we had 180 positive urine cultures at admission from which 125 had at least an antibiotic resistance. Conclusions: Antibiotic resistance is a serious phenomenon, with potential lethal complications, which we encounter daily in urological practice...|$|R
40|$|CDATA[Background: <b>UTI</b> (<b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection)</b> is {{the most}} common among all {{hospital}} acquired infections world wide. In UTI, most common organism is E. coli. Organism responsible for the hospital acquired infection may have tendency to develop multiple drug resistance. E. coli acquired from the hospital source and community source may differ in their resistant against antibiotics Aim: to study and to compare the antibiotic resistant pattern with special reference to ESBL (extended spectrum ? lactamase) in the community acquired and hospital acquired common gram negative bacilli causing UTI. Methods and materials: E. coli from symptomatic UTI cases from both community acquired and hospital acquired UTI were tested for the antimicrobial susceptibility testing against 18 drug of various groups performed by Kirby Bauer's disc diffusion method. Isolates resistant to third generation cephalosporin were tested for ESBL production by double disk synergy test method. Results: Overall E. coli was (70. 96 %) among the all gram negative bacilli of UTI patients. The majority (67 %) of the isolates were from female. ESBL prevalence was 16. 67 % and 30 % among community acquired and hospital acquired E. coli respectively. Cephalosporin group of sensitivity was widely varied among both the group compare to other groups of antibiotics and more resistance was found in hospital strain Discussion and Conclusion: Almost double prevalence of ESBL among hospital strain compared to community strain leads to change in line of management when a hospitalized patient has tendency to develop UTI, plain cephalosporin should not be administered in other diseases also. ]]...|$|E
40|$|In a {{research}} project undertaken to describe the content of adult primary care, episodes of illness for six common primary care conditions were analyzed: URI (upper respiratory infection, <b>UTI</b> (<b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection),</b> HYP (hypertension), AP (abdominal pain), CP (chest pain), and PE (physical examination). Data from the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Care Program-Oregon Region {{were used in the}} project. Episode of the six conditions studied tended to be of brief duration; {{at least half of the}} episodes of each condition except hypertension involved only a single medical visit. The physical examination episodes typically involved both laboratory and radiology services, but these services were less frequently used for the other five conditions. Few episodes involved a referral to a consultant physician, the use of sophisticated ancillary procedures, repeat tests, or a hospitalization. If patients had been billed for the episode-related care involved in treating each episode, the average charge incurred (in 1980 dollars) would have bee: URI $ 38. 67, UTI and HY $ 52. 27 each, AP $ 66. 59, CP $ 46. 54, and PE $ 91. 65, excluding the costs of pharmaceuticals. Ancillary services accounted for one-third or more of the costs for each type of episode except URI. The results suggest that cost savings in primary care are likely to depend less on the control of sophisticated medical technology than on efficiently meeting patient-initiated demands for care and on influencing physician-generated ordering of simple ancillary procedures. The results also suggest the utility of analyzing the distinctive demands on the medical care system that are generated by diverse primary care conditions...|$|E
40|$|No {{prospective}} data {{exist on}} the risk of microbiologically confirmed urinary tract infection (UTI) and asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) in relation to diabetes mellitus and its characteristics. The authors prospectively (1998 – 2002) followed 218 diabetic and 799 nondiabetic Washington State women aged 55 – 75 years for UTI and AB. The baseline examination and two annual follow-up examinations included urine culture, measurement of hemoglobin A 1 c and postvoid residual bladder volume, and a survey of diabetes and other characteristics. Surveillance for UTI included self-reports confirmed by microbiologic culture and medical record review. UTI incidence per 100 person-years was 12. 2 for diabetic women and 6. 7 for nondiabetic women (relative risk (RR) 1. 8, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 2, 2. 7). AB incidence per 100 person-years was 6. 7 for diabetic women and 3. 0 for nondiabetic women (RR 2. 3, 95 % CI: 1. 3, 3. 9). In Cox models adjusted for multiple covariates, the increased UTI risk occurred mainly in women taking insulin (RR 3. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 8, 7. 3) and women with a longer diabetes duration (10 years; RR 2. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 3, 5. 1) compared with nondiabetic women. No clear linear trend between hemoglobin A 1 c and UTI or AB risk was seen.

The ideal antimicrobial agent must have specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics and an adequate spectrum of activity in order to obtain the potential eradication of the pathogen from the site of infection, minimizing the risk of recurrences and ensuring the best safety profile. There are several factors to be considered in the therapy choice: the type of infection, the increasing presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria showing resistance to most antibiotics and the problem of the bacterial internalization, that is a frequent cause of treatment failure and early recurrences.

40|$|AbstractEscherichia coli is {{the major}} causative agent of human cystitis. In this study, a {{preliminary}} molecular analysis carried out by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) demonstrated that 100 % of 31 E. coli strains isolated from patients with recurrent <b>UTIs</b> (<b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections)</b> showed {{the presence of the}} curli fimbria gene (csgA). Curli fimbria is known to be associated with bacterial biofilm formation but not with the adhesion of human cystitis-associated E. coli. Therefore, this work aimed to study how curli fimbria is associated with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) as an adhesion factor. For this purpose, the csgA gene was deleted from strain UPEC- 4, which carries three adhesion factor genes (csgA, fimH and ompA). The wild-type UPEC- 4 strain and its mutant (ΔcsgA) were analyzed for their adhesion ability over HTB- 9 (human bladder carcinoma), Vero (kidney cells of African green monkey) and HUVEC (human umbilical vein) cells in the presence of α-d-mannose. All the wild-type UPEC strains tested (100 %) were able to adhere to all three cell types, while the UPEC- 4 ΔcsgA mutant lost its adherence to HTB- 9 but continued to adhere to the HUVEC and Vero cells. The results suggest that curli fimbria has {{an important role in the}} adhesion processes associated with human UPEC-induced cystitis...|$|R
40|$|Aims: In {{patients}} with idiopathic detrusor overactivity (DO) who showed storage symptoms worsening with time, we checked whether and Which Urodynamic parameter changes {{are associated with}} an increased urgency degree. Materials and Methods: We analyzed retrospectively the urodynamic findings in 54 women - 27 with storage symptoms (Group A, mean age 32 +/- 7 years) and 27 controls (Group B, mean age 30 9 years). These latter had a history of recurrent <b>UTIs</b> (<b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections),</b> but when seen by its had no <b>UTI,</b> DO, lower <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> symptoms, or any other pathological finding. Group A had a first urodynamic examination when first referred (time 1) and were re-assessed a mean of 16 months later (time 2) for worsened storage symptoms. Results: In Group A, an idiopathic DO was shown at both times 1 and 2; urgency of voiding could be delayed during cystometry for >= 2 min (=moderate urgency) at time 1 and for < 2 min (=severe urgency) at time 2; detrusor contraction strength or contractility proved higher than in Group B (P< 0. 001) and increased from time 1 to time 2 (P< 0. 001), detrusor shortening velocity being always the major component of the higher contractility levels. Conclusions: A DO-related increase in bladder contractility may have been further enhanced by severe urgency through a positive feedback mechanism.

40|$|Background: Hysterectomy is the commonest major {{surgical}} procedure performed in gynecology. It {{can be done}} by abdominal or vaginal route {{and with the help of}} laparoscopy. Laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) and total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) although gaining more popularity now a days, though it is associated with higher cost, longer duration of operation, and need general anaesthesia. The latest value study concluded that major haemorrhage, hematoma, ureteric injury, bladder injury, and anesthetic complications were more in laparoscopic assisted hysterectomy (LAVH) group when compared to abdominal and vaginal hysterectomies. In addition LAVH was accomplished in twice the time required for vaginal hysterectomy. The objective of the study was to analyse the indication and to study the complications of nondescent vaginal hysterectomy. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study. 60 women who underwent nondescent vaginal hysterectomy in the department of OBG, B. G. S. Global Institute of Medical Sciences, Banglore, India were included in the study. Patients' records were retrieved. Data regarding patient's age, parity, indications for hysterectomy, uterine size in weeks, previous surgeries in the past, duration of surgery and complications were recorded. Data collected on a semi structured proforma and the same was analysed using suitable statistical analysis. Results: A total of 60 cases were operated for different indications. Among the study participants majority were in the age group of 41 - 45 years with 28 (46. 7 %). Most common indication for hysterectomies were dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) with 27 (45 %), followed by fibroid uterus 15 (25 %). The mean duration of surgery time taken was 50 + 10 minutes. Majority of the women who underwent hysterectomies had bulky uterus with 42 (70 %). Complications were very few. Fever, <b>UTI</b> (<b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection)</b> and headache were seen in 3 (5 %) cases. There was one case of vault sepsis and one case of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). In one patient vaginal hysterectomy could not be completed and abdominal hysterectomy was carried out. Mean hospital duration was 4 days. Conclusions: Vaginal hysterectomy is the least invasive with fewer complications and most economical route for hysterectomy. Nondescent vaginal hysterectomy should be the gynaecologists first choice for hysterectomy. [Int J Reprod Contracept Obstet Gynecol 2016; 5 (7. 000) : 2126 - 2129...|$|E
40|$|CydDC of Escherichia coli is an ABC {{transporter}} that exports cysteine and glutathione {{from the}} cytoplasm to the periplasm to maintain redox homeostasis; its loss elicits a pleiotropic phenotype and causes the periplasm to become ‘over-oxidising’. In addition, the CydDC transporter {{is required for}} the assembly of cytochrome bd-I, a respiratory complex that provides tolerance to nitric oxide, a toxic radical produced by the host immune system in response to bacterial infection. The contribution of CydDC to nitric oxide tolerance and the pleiotropic phenotype of cydDC mutants implicates this exporter complex as a potential target for future therapies to combat E. coli infections. Indeed, given the rising incidence of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, it is becoming increasingly important to develop novel strategies to combat infection. This thesis reports an investigation into the contribution of CydDC to NO tolerance, the relationship between CydDC expression and cytochrome bd-I assembly, adaptations resulting from loss of CydDC, and the requirement for CydDC for survival during infection. To {{gain a better understanding of}} how CydDC expression influences cytochrome bd-I assembly, cydDC cells were grown in the presence of exogenous cysteine and/or reduced glutathione. This work demonstrates for the first time that addition of cysteine and glutathione (i. e. both CydDC substrates) is necessary for cytochrome bd-I assembly in a cydDC strain. In vitro growth curves utilising a nitric oxide donor show that CydDC-mediated reductant export contributes to the tolerance of nitric oxide (NO) both via permitting cytochrome bd-I assembly and through a mechanism independent of this respiratory complex. This work is consistent with a model whereby NO-reactive thiols (i. e. cysteine and glutathione) exported to the periplasm can diminish the levels of NO that can enter the cytoplasm. The transcriptional response of cydDC mutants to exogenously added cysteine and glutathione was explored through microarray analysis in an attempt to gain a greater insight into the role of reduced thiol export to the periplasmic space. The addition of thiols affected genes involved in cell metabolism, respiration and led to the down-regulation of motility-related genes, providing insights into how the presence of CydDC substrates contribute to diverse cellular processes. To investigate the contribution of CydDC to survival during infection, macrophage survival assays were performed along with an infection study using a mouse model of <b>UTI</b> (<b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection).</b> This work demonstrates that CydDC does not contribute to bacterial survival within NO-producing macrophage cells, and that loss of CydDC has no significant effect on the ability to colonise the mouse lower urinary tract. We therefore conclude that while CydDC is important for cytochrome bd-I assembly and NO tolerance in vitro, it may not be a suitable drug target to combat pathogenic strains of E. coli...|$|E

Objetivo:O objetivo desse estudo é associar achados ultrassonográficos antenatais do sistema nefrourinário com a ocorrência de desfechos clínicos nos períodos pósnatal, infância e adolescência, em pacientes com CAKUT. Pacientes e Métodos:Trata-se de um estudo de coorte retrospectivo, com 823 pacientes com CAKUT detectados por ultrassom (US) realizado no Centro de Medicina Fetal do Hospital das Clínicas da UFMG (HC-UFMG) e seguidos por um tempo médio de 58, 7 meses na Unidade de Nefrologia Pediátrica HC-UFMG. Os achados ecográficos do último US que antecedeu o parto foram associados com os desfechos clínicos cirugia, hipertensão (HAS), infecção do trato urinário (ITU), infecção do trato urinário em vigência de quimioprofilaxia, doença renal crônica (DRC), doença renal crônica {{terminal}} e óbito. Para análise estatística, utilizou-se teste Qui-Quadrado de Pearson exato e o teste de Fisher exato. Para a determinação dos valores de prognóstico dos achados ultrassonográficos em relação aos desfechos clínicos, utilizou-se o cálculo de Odds Ratio. Resultados:Os achados ultrassonográficos antenatais do sistema nefrourinário em pacientes com CAKUT que apresentaram associação significativamente estatística com os desfechos clínicos, quando comparados com pacientes com CAKUT sem os respectivos achados foram: hidronefrose unilateral (redução de 42, 5 % na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia, 82. 9 % na chance de DRC, 89, 8 % na chance de doença renal terminal e de 2, 8 % na chance de óbito); hidronefrose unilateral isolada (redução de 57 % na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia, 89, 5 % na chance de DRC, 87, 7 % na chance de doença renal terminal e de 2, 5 % na chance de óbito);hidronefrose bilateral isolada (redução de 30, 7 % na chance de cirurgia e 90, 7 % na chance de doença renal terminal); achado ecográfico compatível com doença cística unilateral (redução de 66, 1 % na chance de cirugia);hidronefrose bilateral (aumento de 1, 7 vezes na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia, 4, 3 vezes na chance de DRC, 4, 7 vezes na chance de doença renal terminal e de 4, 8 vezes na chance de óbito); megaureter unilateral (aumento de 2, 9 vezes na chance de ITU); megaureter bilateral(aumento de 5, 9 vezes na chance de cirurgia, 7, 7 vezes na chance de HAS, 3, 5 vezes na chance de ITU, 3, 6 vezes na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia, 11, 8 vezes na chance de DRC, 17, 9 vezes na chance de doença renal terminal e de 14, 5 vezes na chance de óbito); megabexiga (aumento de 7, 9 vezes na chance de cirurgia, 10, 6 vezes na chance de HAS, 3, 9 vezes na chance de ITU, 4, 4 vezes na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia, 24, 7 vezes na chance de DRC, 35, 8 vezes na chance de doença renal terminal e de 15, 4 vezes na chance de óbito); oligodrâmnio (aumento de 6 vezes na chance de cirurgia, 4, 9 vezes na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia, 30 vezes na chance de DRC, 40 vezes na chance de doença renal terminal e de 14, 5 vezes na chance de óbito); hidronefrose unilateral com megaureter (aumento de 2, 9 vezes na chance de ITU e 2, 4 vezes na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia); hidronefrose bilateral com megaureter (aumento de 6, 8 vezes na chance de DRC, 10, 8 vezes na chance de doença renal terminal e de 13, 3 vezes na chance de óbito); hidronefrose bilateral com megaureter e megabexiga (aumento de 10, 8 vezes na chance de cirurgia, 12, 7 vezes na chance de HAS, 4 vezes na chance de ITU, 4, 3 vezes na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia, de 10, 1 vezes na chance de óbito, de 12, 2 vezes na chance de DRC e 15, 5 vezes na chance de doença renal terminal);hidronefrose bilateral com megabexiga e oligodramnio (aumento de 5, 2 vezes na chance de cirurgia, 23 vezes na chance de óbito, 150, 8 vezes na chance de DRC e de 93, 8 vezes na chance de doença renal terminal).

Background: Recent {{advances in}} obstetric ultrasound {{have led to}} early diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) during antenatal care. Patients with CAKUT may present with unfavorable clinical outcomes thoroughout life. Objectives:this study aimed to associate antenatal nephrourinary ultrasonographic findings with clinical outcomes during postnatal period, childhood and adolescence, in patients with CAKUT. Patients and Methods:Retrospective cohort study of 823 patients with CAKUT seen at the Fetal Medicine Center of Hospital das Clínicas Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (HC-UFMG) and referred to the Pediatric Nephrology Unit of HC-UFMG after delivery. Median follow-up time was 58. 7 months.

The <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> (<b>UTI)</b> involves infection in the kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. These are the organs that urine passes through when eliminated from the body. Women are especially prone to UTIs, even though they generally have anatomically and physiologically normal <b>urinary</b> <b>tract.</b> [1] Reasons for this are not yet well understood. These infections can be very serious when they do occur in men; however, UTIs in men are not as common as in women. A <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> (<b>UTI)</b> also known as Fearnes syndrome is a microbial infection that affects any part of the <b>urinary</b> <b>tract.</b> Normally, urine is sterile. It is usually free of microbes but does contain fluids, salts and waste products. The main cause agent in at least 90 % of uncomplicated infections is Escherichia coli, which live in the bowel (colon) and around the anus. An infection occurs when bacteria get into the bladder or kidney and begin to grow. The infection often starts {{at the opening of the}} urethra where the urine leaves the body and moves upward into the <b>urinary</b> <b>tract.</b> Abnormalities of the <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> that hinder the flow of urine set the stage for an infection.

This study sought to contribute to this end, describing and comparing the technical, bio-psycho-social and familial factors related to the use of IC. The study included 100 Brazilian individuals and 100 German individuals, of which 108 were female and 92 were male, with an age range of 0 to 55 years and a mean age of 14 years. Data were collected using questionnaires, printed (Brazil) and online (Germany), and analyzed using statistical tests, i. e. multivariate logistical regression and analysis of variance. Predictive factors for self-catheterization were defined, such as having six years of schooling or more, not having hydrocephalus, having a lower level of SB (sacral and lumbar), and differences related to country. The study also demonstrated that the non-application of IC was directly influenced by temporary interruptions of the procedure, the daily frequency of IC and the existence of technical difficulties. Also, {{it is important to note}} that continence, even partial, was achieved by 61. 5 % of the participants and that self-catheterization was responsible for increasing the likelihood of continence up to 3 times. The benefits of IC were statistically proven, such as reducing the number of <b>UTIs</b> (<b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections),</b> which were on average higher in Germans than in Brazilians. Interestingly, there was no difference in the number of UTIs among the Germans who performed disinfection (octenidine, polyhexanide), those who cleaned with soap and water and those who did not perform any cleaning before the introduction of the urethral catheter. The preparation of the transition to adulthood starts in childhood also for individuals with SB. Self-catheterization is part of the process of autonomy in self-care and social participation, and therefore deserves to be studied. Cooperative studies between different countries and cultures contribute to understanding the development and rehabilitation of people with SB...|$|R

The control group was created using one-to-one matching for age and menopausal status. The prevalence of recurrent UTI in these patients were compared. Results: The mean age of the 210 participants was 54. 64 ± 5. 15 years. We found no association between POP and recurrent UTI. In the prolapse group, 22 women (21 %) had recurrent UTI compared with 19 women (18 %) in the control group (P= 0. 316).

Patients and methods: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 18, 2015 to March 25, 2015. Clean-catch midstream urine specimens were collected from 186 pregnant women using sterile containers. Then, culture and antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by standard disk diffusion method. Patient information was obtained using pretested structured questionnaire. Data were entered and cleaned using EpiData Version 3 and then exported to Statistical Package for Social Science (Version 16) for further analysis. Results: The prevalence of significant bacteriuria was 14 %. Gram-negative bacteria were more prevalent (73 %). Escherichia coli (34. 6 %), coagulase-negative staphylococci (19. 2 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15. 4 %), and Klebsiella spp. (11. 5 %) were common bacterial isolates, where most of them were resistant against ampicillin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Multidrug resistance (resistance in ≥ 2 drugs) was seen in 100 % of the isolated bacteria. A majority of the bacterial isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, and gentamicin. Conclusion: This study found a number of bacterial isolates with very high resistance to the commonly prescribed drugs from pregnant women with and without symptoms of UTI. Therefore, the early routine detection of causative agents of UTI and determining their drug susceptibility pattern are important for pregnant women to avoid complications in mother and fetus.

Increasing concern about the association between the use of antimicrobials and acquired antimicrobial resistance has highlighted the need for rational pharmacotherapy of common infections in general practice. METHODS: Management of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> in general practice was studied prospectively over 8 weeks. Patients presenting with suspected UTI submitted a urine sample and were enrolled with an opt-out methodology. Data were collected on demographic variables, previous antimicrobial use and urine samples. Appropriateness of different treatment scenarios was assessed by comparing treatment with the laboratory report of the urine sample. RESULTS: A total of 22 practices participated in the study and included 866 patients. Bacteriuria was established for 21 % of the patients, pyuria without bacteriuria for 9 % and 70 % showed no laboratory evidence of UTI. An antimicrobial agent was prescribed to 56 % (481) of the patients, of whom 33 % had an isolate, 11 % with pyuria only and 56 % without laboratory evidence of UTI. When taking all patients into account, 14 % patients had an isolate identified and were prescribed an antimicrobial to which the isolate was susceptible. The agents most commonly prescribed for UTI were co-amoxyclav (33 %), trimethoprim (26 %) and fluoroquinolones (17 %). Variation between practices in antimicrobial prescribing as well as in their preference for certain antimicrobials, was observed. Treatment as prescribed by the GP was interpreted as appropriate for 55 % of the patients. Three different treatment scenarios were simulated, i. e. if all patients who received an antimicrobial were treated with nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim or ciprofloxacin only. Treatment as prescribed by the GP was no more effective than treatment with nitrofurantoin for all patients given an antimicrobial or treatment with ciprofloxacin in all patients. Prescribing cost was lower for nitrofurantoin. Empirical treatment of all patients with trimethoprim only was less effective due to the higher resistance levels. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be considerable scope to reduce the frequency and increase the quality of antimicrobial prescribing for patients with suspected <b>UTI.</b> ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: <b>Urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> (<b>UTIs)</b> are {{the second most}} common bacterial infections in general practice and a frequent indication for prescription of antimicrobials.

40|$|Purpose: Objective {{diagnosis}} of symptomatic <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> in patients prone to asymptomatic bacteriuria is compromised by local host responses {{that are already}} present and the positive urine culture. We investigated interleukin- 6 as a biomarker for nonfebrile <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> severity and diagnostic thresholds for interleukin- 6 and 8, and neutrophils to differentiate between asymptomatic bacteriuria and <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b> Materials and Methods: Patients with residual urine and neurogenic bladders due to spinal lesions included in a long-term Escherichia coli 83972 asymptomatic bacteriuria inoculation trial were monitored for 2 years. Symptom scoring and urine sampling to estimate interleukin- 6 and 8, and neutrophils were performed regularly monthly and at <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> episodes. Results: Patients were followed in the complete study for a mean of 19 months (range 10 to 27) and those with asymptomatic bacteriuria with E. coli 83972 were followed a mean of 11 months (range 4 to 19). A total of 37 nonfebrile <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> episodes with complete data on interleukin- 6 and 8, neutrophils and symptom scoring were documented. Interleukin- 6 was the only marker that persistently increased during <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> compared to asymptomatic bacteriuria in pooled and paired intra-individual comparisons (p < 0. 05). Interleukin- 6 above the threshold (greater than 25 ng/l) correlated to more severe <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> symptoms (p < 0. 05). The sensitivity and specificity of all biomarkers were poor/moderate when differentiating asymptomatic bacteriuria vs all <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> episodes. However, in <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> with worse symptoms interleukin- 6 and neutrophils demonstrated equal good/excellent outcomes.

Design of study Cross sectional study Methods Between March and June 2011 80 women (aged 12 years and older) whose urine was investigated because of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> complaints in one of the four participating primary practices were included. Symptoms, urine clarity and smell and dipstick results for nitrite and leukocyte-esterase were documented.

Results <b>Urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> was diagnosed in 57, 5 % of included women. Dysuria, frequency and nitrite were associated with <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b> The positive predictive value of this combination of variables was 100 % and specificity was also 100 %. When nitrite was negative, the positive predictive value and specificity of dysuria and frequency were too low to confirm <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> (59 % and 54 %).
