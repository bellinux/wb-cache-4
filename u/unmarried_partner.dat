40|$|Family law is now {{replete with}} {{proposals}} advocating {{for the legal}} recognition of nonmarital relationships: those between friends, relatives, <b>unmarried</b> intimate <b>partners,</b> and the like. The presumption underlying these proposals is that legal recognition is financially beneficial to partners. This assumption is sometimes wrong: Legal recognition of relationships can be harmful to <b>unmarried</b> <b>partners</b> — a reality whose impact on policy concerning regulation of nonmarital unions has not been explored. As this Article shows, {{a significant number of}} people benefit financially from nonrecognition of their relationships. While in most cases the state turns a blind eye to this financial gain, {{when it comes to a}} particular set of benefits, the state routinely recognizes partners against their will in order to withhold or terminate benefits, a subset of ascriptive recognition that I call “deprivative recognition. ”Deprivative recognition is unjust because it is asymmetrical: It deprives couples of benefits they would receive if they were unpartnered while they nevertheless remain ineligible to receive benefits granted to married couples in similar arenas. This asymmetry is particularly troublesome because those who enjoy the benefits of nonrecognition often belong to particularly vulnerable populations, such as those who qualify for means-tested programs. This Article recognizes and provides a normative assessment of deprivative recognition and the distributive injustices it creates. Identifying deprivative recognition, in turn, unearths a larger set of theoretical questions about the interplay between cultural recognition and distributive justice in the law of <b>unmarried</b> <b>partners,</b> including a question about what kind of law promotes both cultural recognition and distributive justice for <b>unmarried</b> <b>partners.</b> The Article builds on Nancy Fraser’s theory of recognition and redistribution as a “folk paradigm of justice,” explaining why it is essential for the law of <b>unmarried</b> <b>partners</b> to adopt both of these aspects of justice and how this can be done...|$|R

Scholars of public administration have extensively studied whether women and racial minorities receive fair representation and pay in the public sector, but we have generally ignored {{lesbians and gay}} men, largely because we lack data on the sexual orientation of government employees. Using a 5 percent sample of the 2000 Census, this paper provides new insights into one group of lesbian and gay employees: full-time workers with same-sex <b>unmarried</b> <b>partners.</b> It first determines whether they are as likely to hold jobs in the public and nonprofit sectors as workers who are married, have different-sex <b>unmarried</b> <b>partners,</b> or have never been married. Second, it explores whether lesbians' and gay men's representation is concentrated in particular occupations. It then examines whether workers with same-sex partners earn as much as other workers, and whether any disparities can be explained by race, gender, education, age, occupation, and location.
