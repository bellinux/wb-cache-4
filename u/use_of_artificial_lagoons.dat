40|$|The {{potential}} {{environmental hazard}} of acid mines drainages (AMD) {{is a problem}} {{that need to be addressed}} in mining regions worldwide; biological treatments catalyzed by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) present an interesting alternative because they are much cheaper and more efficient than conventional chemical and physical treatments. The objective of this research was to evaluate the metabolic activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria present in anaerobic samples collected near mining areas and different inoculum in batch assays amended with sulfate (2000 mg L- 1) as electron acceptor and acetate (2. 5 g COD acetate L- 1) as carbon source under environmental control conditions of pH and temperature. A physical, chemical and microbiological characterization of samples collected near mining regions was also carried out with samples collected from different sectors of Portovelo-Zaruma the most important mining region in Ecuador. Then, the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the same samples was evaluated through the measurement of sulfide production and sulfate reduction. Bioassays were conducted to determine the highest sulfate-reducing activity between the granular sludge of: the treatment plant of the National Brewery, the <b>artificial</b> <b>lagoon</b> <b>of</b> the University San Francisco de Quito (USFQ); and the sample collected near Oroporto mine (homogenized of the sediments and supernatant). The best inoculum evaluated was the sediment <b>of</b> the <b>artificial</b> <b>lagoon</b> at University San Francisco de Quito, showing a sulfate reducing activity of 7821. 67 mg SO 42 - kg- 1 VSS d- 1 and a sulfide production of 4855. 69 mg S 2 - kg- 1 VSS d- 1. The production of methane in the sediments <b>of</b> the <b>artificial</b> <b>lagoon</b> at USFQ was also monitored to study microbial competition under anaerobic conditions; obtaining a methanogenic activity of 0. 0115 of g COD-CH 4 g VSS- 1 d- 1...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the need for}} artificial tears by glaucoma patients under topical hypotensive treatment and to identify risk factors associated with it. METHODS: The charts of 175 glaucoma patients under medical treatment and 175 age-matched controls were reviewed. Age, gender, <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> tears, number <b>of</b> glaucoma medications <b>used,</b> and duration <b>of</b> treatment were recorded. RESULTS: Significantly more glaucoma patients (n= 92; 52. 6 %) used artificial tears compared to age-matched controls (n= 31; 17. 7 %) (p 2 (OR= 1. 92), and duration of treatment > 5 years (OR= 2. 93) were risk factors for the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> tears (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Topical treatment with antiglaucoma medication is {{a risk factor for}} the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> tears.
