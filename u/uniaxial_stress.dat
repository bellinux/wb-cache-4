2500|$|Tensile {{strength}} {{represents the}} ability for a geomembrane to resist tensile stress. [...] Geomembranes are most commonly tested for tensile strength using one of three methods; the uniaxial tensile test described in ASTM D639-94, the wide-strip tensile test described in ASTM D4885-88, and the multiaxial tension test described in ASTM D5617-94. [...] The difference in these three methods lies in the boundaries imposed into the test specimens. [...] Uniaxial tests do not provide lateral restraint during testing and thus tests the sample under <b>uniaxial</b> <b>stress</b> conditions.

Using the deformation potential theory, key quan-tities that affect threshold-voltage (electron affinity, bandgap, and valence band density of states) are expressed {{as a function of}} strain. The calculated threshold-voltage shift is in agreement with uniaxial wafer bending and published biaxial strained-Si on relaxed-Si 1 Ge experimental data [1], [2] and explains the technologically important observation of a significantly larger (4) threshold-voltage shift for biaxial relative to <b>uniaxial</b> <b>stressed</b> MOSFETs.
