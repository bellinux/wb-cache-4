It's too little, too late. It's fine to apologise afterwards. They just don't want their names in any more sleaze. No, his apology doesn't mean a thing to me.|$|E
500|$|In January 2005, Ferguson and Wenger were {{embroiled in}} a new row over what had {{happened}} in the tunnel after Pizzagate. Ferguson alleged that Wenger called his players [...] "cheats" [...] and never apologised for his team's behaviour: [...] "It's a disgrace, but I don't expect Wenger to ever apologise, he's that type of person." [...] Wenger then claimed Ferguson was guilty of bringing the game into disrepute; he told reporters that he [...] "will never answer any questions any more about this man," [...] but went further to question the motive of the press: [...] "What I don't <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he does what he wants and you are all at his feet." [...] Both managers came under pressure from the Metropolitan Police Service, then Sports Minister Richard Caborn and Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore {{to put an end to}} the bickering. Ferguson and Wenger agreed to tone down their words, in an attempt to defuse the rivalry. In later years, Ferguson said Arsenal's defeat [...] "scrambled Arsène’s brain" [...] and caused their relationship to breakdown for almost five years.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{causes of}} the Oldham riots are widely disputed, with blame being placed and denied by various groups. What <b>is</b> <b>understood</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the riots stemmed from {{multiple}} causes and incidents, both historic and short-term.|$|R

[...] "What you have to <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the elite have now moved on to a sort of new updated version of this, a new technique. It's not eugenics anymore. Now it's called global warming. The elite need global warming in order to pursue their reduction in population goals." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soomekh became {{close with}} Lionsgate after {{appearing}} in their film Crash (2004) {{and they wanted}} her in their next big film. Not a fan of horror films she found the role challenging. [...] "I had nightmares the first month I was on set. We were shooting it for two months. People say because you're an actor it's {{not a big deal}} because you go in there and it's fake or whatever. But what they don't <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's actually the opposite because, as an actor, when you go in there you have to believe it's real to make your performance real. You have to get lost in the mindframe of this character", she said.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, the Applebys {{could not}} {{understand}} every detail of what the well-bred Carters had said. [...] "Interior decoration"--that didn't mean anything to them. All <b>that</b> they <b>understood</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> fools and failures, {{in the beginning of}} their old age; that they belonged to the quite ludicrously inefficient.|$|R

2500|$|In 1991, {{professor}} and New York Times writer Jay Dolan critiqued Generations for not talking more about class, race and sex, to which Neil Howe replied that they [...] "are probably generalizations not even {{as effective as}} a generation {{to say something about}} how people think and behave. One of the things to <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> most historians never look at history in terms of generations. They prefer to tell history as a seamless row of 55-year-old leaders who always tend to think and behave the same way -- but they don't and they never have. If you look at the way America's 55-year-old leaders were acting in the 1960s -- you know, the ebullient and confidence of the JFKs and LBJs and Hubert Humphreys -- and compare them with today's leaders in Congress -- the indecision, the lack of sure-footedness -- I think you would have to agree that 55-year-olds do not always act the same way and you're dealing with powerful generational forces at work that explain why one generation of war veterans, war heroes, and another generation which came of age in very different circumstances tend to have very different instincts about acting in the world.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Condoleezza Rice criticized Spain for {{not doing}} more to support dissidents in {{communist}} Cuba. American officials were irked {{by the fact that}} Miguel Ángel Moratinos, Minister of Foreign Affairs, chose not to meet with Cuban dissidents during a visit to the United States in April 2007. [...] "There is no secret that we have had differences with Spain on a number of issues, but we have also had very good cooperation with Spain on a number of issues", Rice remarked. Moratinos defended his decision, believing it better to engage with the Cuban regime than by isolating it. [...] "The U.S. established its embargo", he remarked. [...] "We don't agree with it but we respect it. What we hope is that they respect our policy", Moratinos remarked. [...] "What Spain is not prepared to do is be absent from Cuba. And what the U.S. has to <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> given they have no relations with Cuba, they should trust in a faithful, solid ally like Spain." [...] On the relationship between Cuba and Spain, Daniel Fried, U.S. Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, has commented in 2007 that: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Hillary {{is missing}} in action from the Palin-hating brigade", opines a writer at the Weekly Standard. Former Democratic presidential {{candidate}} Hillary Clinton referred to Palin's VP nomination as [...] "historic," [...] stating, [...] ""We should all be proud of Governor Sarah Palin's historic nomination, and I congratulate her and Senator McCain...While their policies would take America in the wrong direction, Governor Palin will add an important new voice to the debate." [...] Wisconsin Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin expressed a different view: [...] "To the extent that this choice represents an effort to court supporters of Hillary Clinton's historic candidacy, McCain misjudges the reasons so many voters rallied around her candidacy. It was Senator Clinton's experience, skill and commitment to change, especially {{in the areas of}} health care and energy policy, that drew such strong support. Sarah Palin's opposition to Roe v. Wade and her support of big oil will not draw Democrats from the Obama-Biden ticket." [...] President of the National Organization for Women (NOW) Kim Gandy said [...] "What McCain does not <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> women supported Hillary Clinton not just because she was a woman, but because she was a champion on their issues. They will surely not find Sarah Palin to be an advocate for women." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{major reason}} why this piece of code <b>was</b> hard to <b>understand</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it {{depended}} on a quirk {{of the way the}} C-compiler for the PDP-11 saved registers in procedure calls.

2500|$|Representatives Ed Royce, the {{chairman}} of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Eliot Engel, members of different parties released a statement that read:The decision by the Egyptian military to take state authority {{out of the hands of}} the ruling Muslim Brotherhood government marks another sharp turning point in Egypt's incomplete revolution. [...] What the Brotherhood neglected to <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> democracy means more than simply holding elections. [...] Real democracy requires inclusiveness, compromise, respect for human and minority rights, and a commitment to the rule of law. [...] Morsi and his inner circle did not embrace any of these principles and instead chose to consolidate power and rule by fiat. [...] As a result the Egyptian people and their economy suffered greatly. It is now up to the Egyptian military to demonstrate that the new transitional government can and will govern in a transparent manner and work to return the country to democratic rule. [...] We are encouraged that a broad cross-section of Egyptians will gather to rewrite the constitution. [...] All parties in Egypt must show restraint, prevent violence, and prepare to be productive players in the future democratic Egypt. [...] We encourage the military to exercise extreme caution moving forward and support sound democratic institutions through which the people and future governments can flourish.|$|E

Ramdass has often told {{me as much}} as he knew of these matters, but it all {{seemed to me to be}} confusion; and the only thing I could <b>understand</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> always {{intriguing}} against each other, instead of putting all their forces in the field, and fighting it out fairly, and so deciding who was to be the chief lord of the Mahrattas." ...|$|R
