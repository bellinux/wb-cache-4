5|$|Advocates for {{the diet}} {{recommend}} {{that it be}} seriously considered after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%. The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular <b>usefulness.</b> These include Dravet syndrome, infantile spasms, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis complex.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{is mostly}} {{used to treat}} anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and nausea due to chemotherapy. Alprazolam may also be {{indicated}} {{for the treatment of}} generalized anxiety disorder, {{as well as for the}} treatment of anxiety conditions with co-morbid depression. The FDA label advises that the physician should periodically reassess the <b>usefulness</b> of the drug.|$|E
5|$|Ashwatha tree (sacred fig tree) is {{also known}} as Kalapvriksha where the deities and Brahma are stated to reside, and it is where sage Narada taught the rishis on the {{procedure}} for worshipping the tree and its <b>usefulness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{validation}} {{therapy is}} based on acceptance of the reality and personal truth of another's experience, while sensory integration {{is based on}} exercises aimed to stimulate senses. There {{is no evidence to}} support the <b>usefulness</b> of these therapies.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} {{of some of}} the southern brochs may date to the Antonine advance, the hypothesis being that whether or not they had previously been symbols of Roman patronage they had now outlived their <b>usefulness</b> from a Roman point of view.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{ends in the}} {{parallel}} universe where Olivia, having broken Walternate's conditioning making her believe herself to be Fauxlivia, is told that no further tests are needed. A vision of Peter warns Olivia that her <b>usefulness</b> to Walternate has ended and her life is in danger.|$|E
5|$|The <b>usefulness</b> of many {{red flags}} are poorly {{supported}} by evidence. The most useful for detecting a fracture are: older age, corticosteroid use, and significant trauma {{especially if it}} results in skin markings. The best determinant {{of the presence of}} cancer is a history of the same.|$|E
5|$|The <b>usefulness</b> of the committee's {{work was}} subject of great debate. While some members thought the {{language}} {{had too many}} compromises and {{was the result of}} design by committee, others felt it was better than the three languages examined. Some felt the language was too complex; others, too simple.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{prospect}} of significant new PD treatments {{in the near}} future. Currently active research directions include the search for new animal models {{of the disease and}} studies of the potential <b>usefulness</b> of gene therapy, stem cell transplants and neuroprotective agents.|$|E
5|$|Tolcapone {{inhibits}} {{the activity}} COMT, an enzyme which degrades dopamine. It {{has been used}} to complement levodopa; however, its <b>usefulness</b> is limited by possible complications such as liver damage. A similarly effective drug, entacapone, has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function. Licensed preparations of entacapone contain entacapone alone or in combination with carbidopa and levodopa.|$|E
5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges. It {{is often said}} that sponges produce {{chemical}} defenses against such predators. However an experiment showed {{that there is no}} relationship between the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the <b>usefulness</b> of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E
5|$|Although it lost <b>usefulness</b> {{for long}} distances, the National Roads system has {{acquired}} local importance: EN13 that cuts {{the city in}} half, in a north-south direction, is used by commuters originating from the northern suburbs and from Vila do Conde, in the south, to travel downtown. The EN205 and the EN206 are used by commuters starting from {{the interior of the}} municipality.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} ISSF pistol events, special {{supportive}} clothing and shoes are not permitted. Optical aids are allowed {{as long as}} they are not mounted on the pistol, which may only have open sights. Ear protection is recommended by the ISSF as well as by coaches, who sometimes stress their <b>usefulness</b> in shutting out distracting noise rather than their necessity for safety reasons (paramount in other shooting disciplines).|$|E
5|$|Following the First World War, it surged in {{popularity}} and {{was associated with}} Hollywood stars {{and members of the}} British Royal Family. Its numbers have dropped significantly since then, with the breed listed as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club; an all-time low was recorded in 2008 when only 43 puppies were registered in the United Kingdom. This decline has been blamed on an influx of foreign and designer breeds, and the Sealyham's reduced <b>usefulness</b> as a working dog.|$|E
5|$|If the ylide carbon is {{substituted}} with an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), the reagent {{is referred}} to as a stabilized ylide. These, similarly to sulfoxonium reagents, react much slower and are typically easier to prepare. These are limited in their <b>usefulness</b> as the reaction can become prohibitively sluggish: examples involving amides are widespread, with many fewer involving esters and virtually no examples involving other EWG's. For these, the related Darzens reaction is typically more appropriate.|$|E
5|$|It also {{provides}} a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of the <b>usefulness</b> of the duality results {{from the fact that}} it is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, {{a nearby}} Army {{reconnaissance}} team conducted a failed {{assault on the}} town {{on the basis that}} the audibly nearby Naval forces—which they did not know were then in retreat—would bring support. The outcome left the Union forces with a combined 5 casualties and 21 wounded. Dialogue between officers following the conflict left the Union navy questioning the <b>usefulness</b> of gunboats in joint expedition settings in which they would not be capable of supporting themselves.|$|E
5|$|The chassis {{was derived}} from the T1E2 chassis, an earlier version of the M13. Based on an M3 Half-track chassis, it {{replaced}} the M13 MGMC half-track after early 1944. As aircraft became more advanced, the <b>usefulness</b> of the M16 was reduced. In the Korean War, it was relegated primarily to the ground-support role, being put out of service in the U.S. Army in 1951.|$|E
5|$|The fortifications {{surrounded}} the entire harbour area, stretching {{all the way}} from Sliema to Kalkara. The design of the batteries was based on the coastal batteries and entrenchments built by the Order in the 18th century, while most of the entrenchments consisted of long stretches of rubble walls. They were armed by guns taken from coastal fortifications such as Saint Mary's Tower. The <b>usefulness</b> of the fortifications was tested in 1799 when a French counter-attack from Fort Manoel was repelled by the insurgent batteries.|$|E
5|$|The {{long black}} and white tail fin can be up {{to a third of}} body length. Several {{hypotheses}} attempt to explain the humpback's pectoral fins, which are proportionally the longest fins of any cetacean. The higher maneuverability afforded by long fins and the <b>usefulness</b> of the increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates possibly supported this adaptation.|$|E
5|$|The {{shortcomings}} {{noted above}} limit the <b>usefulness</b> of the Nazarov cyclization reaction in its canonical form. However, {{modifications to the}} reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to be an active area of academic research. In particular, the {{research has focused on}} a few key areas: rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance, directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step, and improving the overall stereoselectivity. These have been successful to varying degrees.|$|E
5|$|Under Spanish Crown rule, {{the town}} of Gibraltar fell into severe decline. The end of Muslim rule in Spain and the Christian capture of the {{southern}} ports considerably decreased the peninsula's strategic value. It derived some minor economic value from tuna-fishing and wine-producing industries but its <b>usefulness</b> as a fortress was now limited. It was effectively reduced {{to the status of}} an unremarkable stronghold on a rocky promontory and Marbella replaced it as the principal Spanish port in the region.|$|E
5|$|While Star Trek {{in general}} {{features}} few overt references to religion, {{there is a}} clear recognition that a laying aside of past hurts is necessary for peace, similar to the concept of shalom in Judaism. Shatner regretted that Kirk's angst at being outmoded was minimized in the final print. A scene where Spock asks Kirk if they have grown so old and inflexible they have outlived their <b>usefulness</b> had two meanings: it was as much Nimoy asking Shatner as it was their characters.|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} of a mnemonic is intentional, suggesting {{that in order to}} successfully use a mnemonic device an individual should be aware that the mnemonic can aid his or her memory. Awareness of how a mnemonic facilitates one's memory is an example of metamemory. Wimmer and Tornquist conducted an experiment in which participants were asked to recall a set of items. Participants were made aware of the <b>usefulness</b> of a mnemonic device (categorical grouping) either before or after recall. Participants who were made aware of the <b>usefulness</b> of the mnemonic before recall (displaying metamemory for the mnemonic's <b>usefulness)</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} use the mnemonic than those who were not made aware of the mnemonic before recall.|$|E
25|$|There are {{arguments}} {{for and against}} the <b>usefulness</b> of fever, and the issue is controversial.|$|E
