500|$|As October {{passed without}} major headway, Rudd grew anxious {{to return to}} the Witswatersrand gold mines, but Rhodes insisted that he could not leave Bulawayo without the concession. [...] "You must not leave a vacuum," [...] Rhodes instructed. [...] "Leave Thompson and Maguire if {{necessary}} or wait <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> join... if we get anything we must always have someone resident". Thus prevented from leaving, Rudd vigorously tried to persuade Lobengula to enter direct negotiations with him over a concession, but was repeatedly rebuffed. The king only agreed to look at the draft document, mostly written by Rudd, just before Shippard was due to leave in late October. At this meeting, Lobengula discussed the terms with Rudd for over an hour. Charles Helm, a missionary based in the vicinity, was summoned by the king to act as an interpreter. According to Helm, Rudd made a number of oral promises to Lobengula that were not in the written document, including [...] "that they would not bring more than 10 white men to work in his country, that they would not dig anywhere near towns, etc., and that they and their people would abide by the laws of his country and in fact be his people." ...|$|E

During {{the development of}} this motor, the German Porsche engineers often asked Donohue if the motor finally had enough power. His answer was [...] "it will never have enough power <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> spin the wheels {{at the end of the}} straightaway in high gear." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Go by all means, Berenice," [...] he answered. [...] "You and I {{are better}} apart. But {{there is one}} thing which I must say to you, and you must hear. What has passed between you and me is the epitome of the love-making of my life. You are the only woman whom I have desired to make my wife. You are the only woman whom I have loved, and shall love <b>until</b> <b>I</b> die. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make you no reparation, none is possible! Yet these things are my justification." ...|$|R

It's a shame because there's tons of music {{unreleased}} that will just sit in a box <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> stomach it." [...] When asked which of his two former bands would ever reform, he said, [...] "Pumpkins. You'll never see Zwan. I'll never go anywhere near those people. Ever. I mean, I detest them. You can put that in capital letters. Bad people. James and D'arcy are good people. They might be misguided people, but they're good people." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Burns {{lacked the}} funds {{to pay for his}} passage to the West Indies, Gavin Hamilton {{suggested}} that he should [...] "publish his poems in the mean time by subscription, as a likely way of getting a little money to provide him more liberally in necessaries for Jamaica." [...] On 3 April Burns sent proposals for publishing his Scotch Poems to John Wilson, a local printer in Kilmarnock, who published these proposals on 14 April 1786, {{on the same day that}} Jean Armour's father tore up the paper in which Burns attested his marriage to Jean. To obtain a certificate that he was a free bachelor, Burns agreed on 25 June to stand for rebuke in the Mauchline kirk for three Sundays. He transferred his share in Mossgiel farm to his brother Gilbert on 22 July, and on 30 July wrote to tell his friend John Richmond that, [...] "Armour has got a warrant to throw me in jail <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find a warrant for an enormous sum...

Sir Geraint Evans possessed considerable talent for comedy and made us laugh in the roles of Falstaff and Leporello, but his career depended every move on his voice. <b>Until</b> Max Boyce, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> think of no-one who has become famous outside Wales for his Welshness.
