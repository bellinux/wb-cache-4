5|$|According to a 1258 chronic, while Sancho II of Portugal was disputing {{the throne}} with his brother, Afonso, who was invited by the knights {{to take over}} the Portuguese throne, Gavião of Varzim used the {{opportunity}} to destroy the king's assets in Lower Varzim. He violently entered in the king's lands, destroyed it significantly, {{in such a way that}} no bread could be sowed, nor a car could cross that place as it often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Sancho II was overthrown, Afonso became king and ordered the resettlement of the royal land and king's chronicler explicitly stated that all the port was property of the king.|$|E
5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's signal {{to the point where}} LIDAR data can be collected at any time of the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E

5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

25|$|An Echinostoma {{infection}} can {{be diagnosed}} by observing the parasite {{eggs in the}} faeces of an infected individual, under a microscope.

To confirm which species is causing the infection adult worms must be recovered from the infected individual, such as with anthelmintic treatment.|$|E

25|$|But {{suppose we}} rename 0 and 1 to 1 and 0 respectively. Then {{it would still}} be Boolean algebra, and {{moreover}} operating on the same values. However it would not be identical to our original Boolean algebra because now we find ∨ behaving the way ∧ <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and vice versa. So there are still some cosmetic differences to show that we've been fiddling with the notation, despite the fact that we're still using 0s and 1s.|$|E
