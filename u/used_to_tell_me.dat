Never, ever, humiliate your husband.' Her motto was to carry on in gracious style". Hayfron died in 1992 from a chronic kidney ailment.|$|E
500|$|The loss of {{her husband}} left Pankhurst with new {{responsibilities}} and {{a significant amount of}} debt. She moved the family to a smaller house at 62 Nelson Street, resigned from the Board of Guardians, and was given a paid position as Registrar of Births and Deaths in Chorlton. This work gave her more insight into the conditions of women in the region. She wrote in her autobiography: [...] "They <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> their stories, dreadful stories some of them, and all of them pathetic with that patient and uncomplaining pathos of poverty." [...] Her observations {{of the differences between the}} lives of men and women, for example in relation to illegitimacy, reinforced her conviction that women needed the right to vote before their conditions could improve. In 1900 she was elected to the Manchester School Board and saw new examples of women suffering unequal treatment and limited opportunities. During this time she also re-opened her store, with the hope that it would provide additional income for the family.|$|E

[...] "You was always such a dear, thoughtless child! Don't you {{remember}} that day when you waded in baby's bath, an' then said you wasn't wet a bit, only a very little, an' you rather liked it? Indeed she did: you needn't laugh, Master Tom, I remember {{it as well as}} if it happened yesterday." ...|$|R

You don't spend {{anything}} on yourself, that's true enough; but there's another name for that. You think {{you are going to}} have what you want out of me for three years, and then cast me off without hearing what I think of you. You think I would have submitted to your airs if I had known you had only a beggarly five hundred pounds in the world. You ought to have told me." ...|$|R

It ain't any <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> a bluejay hasn't {{got a sense of}} humor, because I know better. And memory, too. They brought jays here from all over the United States to look down that hole, every summer for three years. Other birds, too. And they could all see the point except an owl that come from Nova Scotia to visit the Yo Semite, and he took this thing in on his way back. He said he couldn't see {{anything}} funny in it. But then he was a good deal disappointed about Yo Semite, too." ...|$|R
500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy. It scared me, the word 'vibrations.' She told me about dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise {{with the potential for}} hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that {{it would be fun to}} write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E
500|$|Merryman had a {{relationship}} with stock car racing driver Jeff Gordon. She first met Gordon in 2000 while she was employed in Palm Beach, Florida at a Neiman Marcus store in a mall where she advised customers about cosmetics products. Merryman did not recognize the race-car driver at their first meeting, though her friends were excited to meet him during the same encounter. Initially Merryman turned down Gordon's request to take her out for lunch. One year after their initial encounter, they began {{a relationship}}. They were romantically-linked for 11 months. Merryman and Gordon vacationed together in Saint-Jean, Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean in January 2003 to celebrate the New Year. This relationship caused difficulty for his then-ongoing marriage to Brooke Sealy. Sealy discovered Gordon's relationship with Merryman and subsequently divorced the race-car driver. Gordon's wife, who also went by the name Jennifer Brooke Gordon, cited Merryman by name in her divorce papers with the racecar driver. Merryman was featured in the October 2003 issue of Playboy magazine, where she was interviewed about her relationship with Gordon. Merryman stated that Gordon had confided in her: [...] "He got married when he was 23 and has been on the racetrack since he was a kid. He <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all the time he {{never had a chance to}} have fun." [...] She reflected on what she had learned after her period of time with Gordon, saying in the future she would avoid relationships both with men of his occupation and those who were married. Gordon did not comment on Merryman's 2003 appearance in the magazine. When asked about the article, Gordon refused to comment on it. He stated: [...] "It's not even worth commenting on. All I want to talk about is being fast". Gordon's divorce was finalized in June 2003.|$|E

But that blessing is being {{destroyed}} by your immigrants that are going over there. Especially the Jews, they said. The Second World War was started by the Jews and the Third World War, whatever it is, is between Israel and the Arab countries. I was there as well.

But come, Beniah, I am longing to hear what my father commissioned you to say or do." ...|$|R
2500|$|Tracey Ullman {{was born}} Trace Ullman in Slough, Buckinghamshire, the younger of two daughters, to Dorin (...) and Antony John Ullman.

My mother said it was spelled the American way, but I don't think she can spell! I always wanted a middle name. My mum <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> it was Mary but I never believed her. I looked on my birth certificate and I didn't have one, just Trace Ullman." ...|$|E
2500|$|He first {{planned to}} study forestry. He <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> his {{dreams of a}} life in the open, alone on a hillside, a sea of green tree tops below him. While taking the {{entrance}} exams for Pennsylvania State College {{he found that the}} forestry course would take four years, while there was a fine two-year agricultural course. Beginning to feel, too, {{that he did not want}} to live away from people, but among them, he chose agriculture. His interest in economics and politics developed intensely at this time, and while at college he wrote me constantly for the latest news of the socialist movement. We were always very close to one another, and no matter how many months or years we were apart, we could always pick up where we had left off."

60|$|I had but one wish {{and sense}} of duty at that moment, namely, to carry home those dear remains to the resting-place of his father in Anjou, where I hope myself to rest. It was of no <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that all places would be alike to my Philippe when we should awake on the Resurrection day. I was past reason, and was possessed with a feeling that I would be sacrilege to leave him among the countless unnamed graves of the wounded who, like him, had {{struggled}} as far as Brisach to die. I fancied I should {{not be able to}} find him, and, besides, it was an enemy's country! I believe opposition made me talk wildly and terrify my brother; at any rate, he swore to me that the thing should be done, if only I would return to Nancy and to my child. I fancied, most unjustly, that this was meant to deceive me, and get me out of the way while they buried him whom I loved so much, and I refused to stir without the coffin.|$|R

6000|$|Smoke? I always {{smoke from}} 3 till 5 Sunday afternoons--and in New York {{the other day}} I smoked a week, day and night. But when Livy is well I smoke only those two hours on Sunday. I'm [...] "boss" [...] of the habit, now, and shall never let it boss me any more. Originally, I quit solely on Livy's account, (not that I {{believed}} there was the faintest reason in the matter, but just as I would deprive myself of sugar in my coffee if she wished it, or quit wearing socks if she thought them immoral), and I stick to it yet on Livy's account, and shall always continue to do so, without a pang. But somehow it seems a pity that you quit, for Mrs. T. didn't mind it if I remember rightly. Ah, it is turning one's back upon a kindly Providence to spurn away from us the good creature he sent to make the breath of life a luxury {{as well as a}} necessity, enjoyable as well as useful, to go and quit smoking when then ain't any sufficient excuse for it! Why, my old boy, when they <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I would shorten my life ten years by smoking, they little knew the devotee they were wasting their puerile word upon--they little knew how trivial and valueless I would regard a decade that had no smoking in it! But I won't persuade you, Twichell--I won't until I see you again--but then we'll smoke for a week together, and then shut off again.|$|R

60|$|During {{this time}} my mother <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be {{frequently}} <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> old stories {{of her former}} adventures, which, however, were no ways pleasant to me; for by it, though she did not <b>tell</b> it <b>me</b> in plain terms, yet I could easily understand, joined with what I had heard myself, of my first tutors, that in her younger days she had been both whore and thief; but I verily believed she had lived to repent sincerely of both, {{and that she was}} then a very pious, sober, and religious woman.|$|R

Well, I've been meaning to come for ever so long, and putting it off, and putting it off, and putting it off, as one WILL put things off, you know, when you're not quite sure about them, until last evening. And then our friend, Mr. Arthur Berkeley, who knows everybody, {{talked to me about}} your husband and you, and told me he thought you wouldn't mind my coming to see you, for he fancied you hadn't much society up here that you cared for or sympathised with: though, of course, I'm dreadfully afraid of coming to call upon you, because I know you're the sister of that very clever Mr. Oswald, whose sad death we were all so sorry to hear about in the papers; and naturally, as you've lived so much with him and with Mr. Le Breton, you must be so awfully learned and all that sort of thing, and no doubt despise ignorant people like myself dreadfully. But you really mustn't despise me, Mrs. Le Breton, because, you see, I haven't had all the {{advantages}} that you've had; indeed, the only clever people I've ever met in all my life are your husband and Mr. Arthur Berkeley, except, of course, Cabinet ministers and so forth, and they don't count, because they're political, and so very old, and solemn, and grand, and won't take any notice of us girls, except to sit upon us. So that's what's made me rather afraid to call upon you, because I thought you'd be quite too much in the higher education way for a girl like me; and I haven't got any education at all, except in rubbish, as your husband <b>used</b> always <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> And now I want you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all about Mr. Le Breton, and the baby--Dot, you call her, Mr. Berkeley told me--and yourself, too; for, though I've never seen you before, I feel, of course, like an old friend of the family, having known your husband so very intimately.' ...|$|R
