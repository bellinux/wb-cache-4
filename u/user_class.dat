The comparison focuses on the levels, shares, and composition of employment in the commercial/industrial and government sectors that represent potential classes of land mobile communications users. The major findings of the analysis are as follows: (1) non-metropolitan commercial/industrial <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> of land mobile communication services exist in significant numbers; (2) the compositions of non-metropolitan and metropolitan commercial/industrial <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> of land mobile communication services closely resemble each other; (3) non-metropolitan areas have significant levels of the government <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> that represent potential markets for land mobile communication services; and (4) non-metropolitan local governments have a significantly larger proportion of their employment in the primary <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> of private land mobile radio service than do metropolitan local governments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{analyze the}} user {{accommodation}} capabilities of LTE-A systems with carrier aggregation for the LTE users and LTE-A users, respectively. The adopted performance metric is equivalent capacity (EC), {{defined as the}} maximum number of users allowed in the system given the user QoS requirements. Specifically, both LTE and LTE-A users are divided into heterogeneous <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> with different QoS requirements, traffic characteristics and bandwidth weights. Two bandwidth allocation strategies are studied, i. e., the fixed-weight strategy and the cognitive-weight strategy, where the bandwidth weights of different <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> are prefixed under the former and dynamically changing with the cell load conditions under the latter. For each strategy, closed-form expressions of ECs of different <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> are derived for LTE and LTE-A users, respectively. A net-profit-maximization problem is further formulated to discuss the tradeoff among the bandwidth weights. Extensive simulations are conducted to corroborate our analytical results, and demonstrate an interesting discovery that only a slightly higher spectrum utilization of LTE-A users than LTE users can result in a significant EC gain when the user traffic is bursty. Moreover, the cognitive-weight strategy is shown to outperform considerably the fixed-weight one due to stronger adaptability to the cell load conditions.

A major problem in user modelling is in categorising a new user into known <b>user</b> <b>classes.</b> In this paper we consider user classification as a recognition problem where a new user is an uncertain object of undetermined class and we must determine {{the membership of the}} object in each of a number of prototypical <b>user</b> <b>classes.</b> The temporal nature of user behaviour suggests a belief updating approach to user recognition. We examine the FILUM approach to user recognition and present a more generalised model. We compare the generalised FILUM model to a new interval support version of Einhorn and Hogarth's anchor and adjustment belief updating approach. We present an example using the iterated prisoner 's dilemma problem implemented in the Fril++ object oriented uncertain logic programming language...|$|R
