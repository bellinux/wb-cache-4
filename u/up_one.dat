5|$|At the hospital, {{the family}} learns that Peter's {{condition}} {{has a big}} chance of suddenly failing and thus killing him. They learn that the only other option besides the daily procedures is that one must give <b>up</b> <b>one</b> of their kidneys to Peter. Lois volunteers to give <b>up</b> <b>one</b> of hers, but is informed that she isn't a match. Brian then also volunteers, and they discover {{that he has the}} same kidney type as Peter. However, as dog kidneys are smaller than human's, the donation requires both kidneys. If the procedure was successful, Brian would lose his life. Brian decides {{to go along with the}} procedure to save Peter's life. Reluctant to lose Brian, Stewie kidnaps him and takes him to the local playground, in hopes of staying there the rest of their lives. Brian convinces Stewie to let him go, stating that Stewie needs his father more than he needs his dog. The next day, Brian and Peter prepare to undergo the kidney transfer. However, Dr. Hartman reveals that he is also a match and has decided to donate one of his own kidneys. He also points that it was unlikely Peter would survive the surgery either, as there were doubts that using dog kidneys would work, meaning that Brian would have died for nothing. Thus, Brian's life is spared.|$|E

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} {{reports on the}} relationship between children`s level of achievement and well-being and ability to cooperate between teachers and parents. Kristiansand municipality has conducted training including teacher`s «Taking <b>Up</b> <b>Ones</b> Worries» - method, a dialogue and network based intervention. The method aims to enhance employees skills in addressing anxiety with the parents at earliest possible date. Aim and research question: The study has a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach where the intention was to describe and interpret the participant`s experiences and attitudes towards their participation in «Taking <b>Up</b> <b>Ones</b> Worries» - conversations, by putting this in understandable context. The focus has been: How to describe and interpret teacher`s participation in «Taking <b>Up</b> <b>Ones</b> Worries» - conversations? Method: I used focusgroup as datacollection method and qualitative content analysis to the processing unit of analysis. Result: The study shows three different perspectives on teacher`s approach and position in the talks. In the first perspective, the thesis in teacher`s ongoing dialogical process in relation to their worries. The next is the teacher`s needs of trust and confidence. The latter perspective is how teacher`s encouraged to accountability in their relationships with parents. Conclusion: The study`s findings confirmed earlier research on how attitudes and reflex can be linked to teacher`s approach to «Taking <b>Up</b> <b>Ones</b> Worries» - conversations. Further reflecting the informant`s descriptions and interpretations of the meaning of dialogic elements between teachers and parents, and how teacher`s initiative may seem supportive parents.
