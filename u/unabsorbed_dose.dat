40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the in vitro dermal absorption of ethylene glycol (EG) through dermatomed human abdominal skin (containing epidermis and dermis), obtained from cadavers within 24 hours of death and kept frozen until processed. Three formulations of EG (neat, 50 %, and 10 % aqueous solutions) were applied in triplicate to skin samples from 6 donors, and placed in Teflon Bronaugh flow-through diffusion cells. Barrier integrity of each sample was evaluated with 3 H-H 2 O prior to applying EG and only data from samples passing the test were used. A physiological receptor fluid was pumped beneath the skin samples and collected in a fraction collector at predetermined time points through 24 hours. Possible volatilized EG was trapped in a charcoal basket located above each skin sample. Each skin sample was treated with an infinite dose of 500 mL of EG formulation/cm 2. At the end of 24 hours, volatilized EG trapped in the headspace was collected, the <b>unabsorbed</b> <b>dose</b> was removed from the skin and the skin was rinsed, tape stripped, and solubilized along with a rinse of the flow-through cells, and total radioactivity was determined. Only a small fraction (1 %) of the applied EG was absorbed in 24 hours, of which < 0. 7 % penetrated through the skin and* 0. 4 % remained in the skin. Recovery (mass balance) of the applied EG was between 93 % and 99 %, which further validated the observed low dermal penetration of EG. The net penetration of the applied EG over 24 hours was concentration proportional, comprising 2. 97 + 0. 78, 1. 75 + 0. 62, and 0. 23 + 0. 12 mg/cm 2 of the neat, 50 %, and 10 % formula-tions, respectively. The steady-state flux of EG was established between 16 and 24 hours. The mean steady-state flux of EG through dermatomed skin was 217, 129, and 15 mg/cm 2 h for the neat, 50 %, and 10 % aqueous formulations, respectively, con-sistent with concentration-proportional penetration of EG. The steady-state permeation coefficient (Kp) for EG was low, between 1. 5 104 and 2. 6 104 cm/h. These findings demonstrate that EG dermal penetration is expected to be very low and to be slow, indicating very limited systemic or internal dose of EG due to dermal exposure...|$|E
40|$|This second {{revision}} updates {{the list}} of naled products currently registered in California, revises the dermal absorption rate used in the exposure assessment, and adds {{a list of the}} <b>unabsorbed</b> dermal <b>doses</b> (in µg/cm 2) to account for the localized skin effects considered in the risk characterization document (RCD). This exposure assessment is written to {{be an integral part of}} the Department’s RCD prepared for naled, which is an organophosphate used for control of a great variety of insects and mites. A total of 15 naled products are registered in California, with over 70 % of the total (reported) annual usage being on cotton, fruits, nuts, vegetables, and other agricultural commodities. The non-agricultural uses include applications in aquatic areas, forests, dwellings, and indoor environments. The toxicological endpoints of primary concern are acute and subchronic cholinergic signs and localized skin effects observed in animal studies. Dichlorvos (DDVP), which is the initial metabolite of naled in the biotransformation process and an insecticide itself, is listed under California's Proposition 65 (the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986) as a chemical known to the State to cause cancer. During the 15 -year period between 1982 and 1996, there were a total of 145 illnesses or injuries reported in California as having an association wit...|$|R
