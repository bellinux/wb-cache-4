5|$|Palmer {{publishes a}} study which finds no {{bacteria}} in the human stomach. He concludes earlier discoveries were a result of contamination. Unfortunately, he chooses not to use a silver staining method, which will be later <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> H. pylori by Warren and Marshall.|$|E
5|$|An X-ray of {{swallowed}} barium may be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> {{the size}} and shape of the esophagus, and the presence of any masses. The esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the esophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the esophagus. During an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken. If cancer of the esophagus is being investigated, other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used.|$|E
5|$|The Cat's Eye was {{the first}} {{planetary}} nebula to be observed with a spectroscope by William Huggins on August 29, 1864. Huggins' observations revealed that the nebula's spectrum was non-continuous and made of a few bright emission lines, first indication that planetary nebulae consist of tenuous ionised gas. Spectroscopic observations at these wavelengths are used in abundance determinations, while images at these wavelengths have been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the intricate structure of the nebula.|$|E

50|$|Both Starshines derived {{their powers}} from their bionic Spaceknight armor. In {{addition}} to giving them superhuman {{strength and the}} ability to fly in space across interstellar distances, the armor could channel the extra-dimensional energy known as the Living Light from its eyes, which they could <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the true form of a disguised Dire Wraith, or as destructive energy beams.|$|R
5|$|Ultrasound of {{the thyroid}} may be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> whether {{structures}} are solid or filled with fluid, helping {{to differentiate between}} nodules and goitres and cysts. It may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy may be taken concurrently of thyroid tissue to determine {{the nature of a}} lesion. These biopsies are then sent for histopathology and cytology. When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan may take place. This can determine {{the size and shape of}} lesions, reveal whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active, and reveal and monitor sites of thyroid disease or cancer deposits outside the thyroid.|$|E

25|$|In proteomics, MALDI is {{used for}} the rapid {{identification}} of proteins isolated by using gel electrophoresis: SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, affinity chromatography, strong/weak ion exchange, isotope coded protein labelling (ICPL), and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Peptide mass fingerprinting is the most popular analytical application of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometers. MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometers are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> amino acid sequence of peptides using post-source decay or high energy collision-induced dissociation (further use see mass spectrometry).|$|E
25|$|When space {{efficiency}} {{is not a}} concern, trivial t = n schemes can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> a secret to any desired subsets of the players simply by applying the scheme for each subset. For example, to reveal a secret s to any {{two of the three}} players Alice, Bob and Carol, create three different (2, 2) secret shares for s, giving the three sets of two shares to Alice and Bob, Alice and Carol, and Bob and Carol.|$|E
25|$|On 28 September, the BBC {{unveiled}} a Twitter hashtag (#SaveTheDay) and an ident {{that was used}} to promote the special. Respectively, the hashtag and the ident were shown before and after the premiere of Atlantis on BBC One. The hashtag was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> all subsequent promotional material. On 7 November 2013, a video starring Smith in character as the Doctor was released promoting the hashtag, promising exclusive content. A website was launched to reveal the content.|$|E

25|$|Due to its {{position}} separating the thorax and abdomen, fluid abnormally {{present in the}} thorax, or air abnormally present in the abdomen, may collect {{on one side of}} the diaphragm. An X-ray may reveal this. Pleural effusion, in which there is fluid abnormally present between the two pleurae of the lungs, is detected by an X-ray of the chest, showing fluid collecting in the angle between the ribs and diaphragm. An X-ray may also be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> a pneumoperitoneum, in which there is gas in the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|The {{heads-up display}} shows {{the amount of}} {{ammunition}} for the currently selected weapon, along with the suit's shield status and its energy. The game also features an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of the}} game. On every floor, the player can access to the computer terminal with an ID Card and a Record Card in their possession. ID cards are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> unexplored parts of the floor, while Record Cards hold pre-recorded messages that can be read with the terminal. At certain points in the game, the player can also acquire Armor ROMs to enhance the suit's defense system, which reduces damage from enemy attacks.|$|E
25|$|There are {{echoes of}} Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, and other {{historical}} and biographical writers {{from the ancient}} world. The most frequent intertexts are the Homeric epics. The novel is told in a linear manner; after a brief first person introduction by Chariton, the narrator uses the third person. Much {{of the novel is}} told in direct speech, revealing the importance of oratory and rhetorical display (as in the presentation before the King of Persia) and perhaps as well the influence of New Comedy. Dramatic monologues are also <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the conflicted states of the characters' emotions and fears (what should Callirhoe do, given that she is pregnant and alone?). The novel also has some amusing insights into ancient culture (for instance, the pirates decide to sell Callirhoe in Miletus rather than in the equally wealthy Athens, because they considered Athenians to be litigious busybodies who would ask too many questions).|$|E

50|$|Schaeffer has {{continued}} to encourage a broad understanding of Tibetan culture and tradition, particularly through his 2014 book, The Culture of the Book in Tibet, published through Columbia University Press. This work explores the contours of Tibetan book production, consumption, and <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the significant, yet incredibly variable, role of books in Tibetan cultural life. Through this, Schaeffer reveals not only the crucial role of textual criticism and scholarship in Tibetan Buddhist practice, but also how Tibetan books simultaneously functioned as relics and sites of devotional activity.|$|R
50|$|Dream Chronicles: The Book of Air, Dream Chronicles: The Book of Water and Dream Chronicles: The Book of Fire {{belong to}} the second trilogy of the series named Lyra's Destiny, {{telling the story of}} a mortal young girl named Lyra, who embarks on many {{unforeseen}} quests, just like her mother Faye <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> and <b>to</b> accept her unique destiny: Become the new Fairy Lord.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{improvements}} The Book of Air has over its predecessors is a system of hints for locating difficult items. Although {{it is still possible}} to get hung up on some of the game's more taxing brainteasers, players will no longer find themselves stuck trying to find items thanks to a recharging magnifying glass 'hint power' that can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> an object's location. But if there are not any, the power of hints is not used. There are two difficulty modes to play, Casual and Challenge. Each mode has the same puzzles but their complexities are different. At the beginning, the game offers players the option to play in either Casual or Challenge Mode, and if they want the game to offer the slightest bit of resistance they would pick the former. While Casual Mode offers simpler puzzles and the ability to skip them if players get stuck long enough, Challenge Mode offers slightly harder puzzles, but will not let players skip any. Players cannot change the difficulty once they have chosen it.|$|E
500|$|Isotopes {{can also}} be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the fate of {{various parts of the}} {{substrate}} molecules in the final products. For example, it is sometimes difficult to discern the origin of an oxygen atom in the final product; since it may have come from water or from part of the substrate. This may be determined by systematically substituting oxygen's stable isotope 18O into the various molecules that participate in the reaction and checking for the isotope in the product. The chemical mechanism {{can also be}} elucidated by examining the kinetics and isotope effects under different pH conditions, by altering the metal ions or other bound cofactors, [...] by site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acid residues, or by studying the behaviour of the enzyme in the presence of analogues of the substrate(s).|$|E
500|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are dark brown. A light {{microscope}} may be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> more {{features of the}} spores, including smooth surfaces, a dark brown color, an [...] shape in face view and an egg shape in side view, and dimensions of 7.5–9.5 by 4–4.5µm. The apex of the spore appears [...] {{because of the presence}} of a germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are hyaline (translucent), with dimensions of 14–16 by 6.5–7.5µm. The paraphyses are 9–11 by 8–10µm, hyaline, and collapse readily. The pleurocystidia (cystidia present on the gill face) are abundant, roughly cylindrical, hyaline, and measure 100–150 by 20–35µm. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of an gill) are present in young specimens, and are roughly ellipsoid, measuring 50–80 by 15–25µm. [...] Clamp connections are abundant in the hyphae in all tissues through the fruit body.|$|E

500|$|Ruthenium can be {{oxidized}} to ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2, {{oxidation state}} +4) which can in turn be oxidized by sodium metaperiodate to the volatile yellow tetrahedral ruthenium tetroxide, RuO4, an aggressive, strong oxidizing agent with structure and properties analogous to osmium tetroxide. Like osmium tetroxide, ruthenium tetroxide {{is a potent}} fixative and stain for electron microscopy of organic materials, and is mostly <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the structure of polymer samples. [...] Dipotassium ruthenate (K2RuO4, +6), and potassium perruthenate (KRuO4, +7) are also known. Unlike osmium tetroxide, ruthenium tetroxide is less stable and is strong enough as an oxidising agent to oxidise dilute hydrochloric acid and organic solvents like ethanol at room temperature, and is easily reduced to ruthenate (...) in aqueous alkaline solutions; it decomposes to form the dioxide above 100°C. Unlike iron but like osmium, ruthenium does not form oxides in its lower +2 and +3 oxidation states. Ruthenium forms dichalcogenides only when reacted directly with the chalcogens, which are diamagnetic semiconductors crystallizing in the pyrite structure and thus must contain ruthenium(II).|$|E
500|$|Based in New York City, in 1950 Martello {{founded the}} American Hypnotism Academy, {{continuing}} {{to direct the}} organization until 1954. From 1955 to 1957, he served as treasurer of the American Graphological Society, {{and worked as a}} freelance graphologist for such corporate clients as the Unifonic Corporation of America and the Associated Special Investigators International. He also published a column titled [...] "Your Handwriting Tells" [...] for eight years that ran in the Chelsea Clinton News, and supplied various articles on the subject of graphology to different magazines. In the city, he also began to frequent the gay scene. In 1955, Martello was awarded a Doctorate in Divinity by a non-accredited organization, the National Congress of Spiritual Consultants, a clearing house for registered yet unaffiliated ministers. That year, he founded the Temple of Spiritual Guidance, taking on the role of Pastor, which he would continue in until 1960, when he began to focus on his writing and his new philosophy of [...] "psychoselfism". In 1961 he published his first book, Your Pen Personality, in which he discussed the manner in which handwriting could be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the personality of the writer. Martello corresponded with California-based Pagan Victor Henry Anderson, and it was at Martello's encouragement that Anderson established his Mahaelani Coven circa 1960.|$|E
