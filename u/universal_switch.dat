For increased compliance current (cc) during set from 50 μA to 800 μA, the set current runs into self- limitation while the reset behavior changes from gradual to abrupt.

40|$|Abstract–An FPGA {{switch box}} {{is said to}} be hyper-universal if it is routable for all {{possible}} surrounding multi-pin net topolo-gies satisfying the routing resource constraints. It is desirable to design hyper-universal switch boxes with the minimum number of switches. A previous work, <b>Universal</b> <b>Switch</b> Module, consid-ered such a design problem concerning-pin net routings around a single FPGA switch box. However, as most nets are multi-pin nets in practice, it is imperative to study the problem that involves multi-pin nets. In this paper, we provide a new view of global routings and formulate the most general-sided switch box de-sign problem into an optimum-partite graph design problem. Applying a powerful decomposition theorem of global routings, we prove that, for a fixed, the number of switches in an opti-mum-sided switch box with terminals on each side is, by constructing some hyper-universal switch boxes with switches. Furthermore, we obtain optimum, hyper-universal-sided and-sided switch boxes, and propose hyper-universal-sided switch boxes with less than switches, which is very close to the lower bound obtained for pure 2 -pin net models in [5]. ...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{functional}} imaging {{have provided}} noninvasive techniques to probe brain organization of multiple constructs including language and memory. Because of high overall rates of agreements with older techniques, including Wada testing and cortical stimulation mapping (CSM), some {{have proposed that}} those approaches should be largely abandoned because of their invasiveness, and replaced with noninvasive functional imaging methods. High overall agreement, however, is based largely on concordant language lateralization in series dominated by cases of typical cerebral dominance. Advocating a <b>universal</b> <b>switch</b> from Wada testing and cortical stimulation mapping to {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) ignores the differences in specific expertise across epilepsy centers, many of which often have greater skill with one approach rather than the other, and that Wada, CSM, fMRI, and MEG protocols vary across institutions resulting in different outcomes and reliability. Specific patient characteristics also affect whether Wada or CSM might influence surgical management, making it difficult to accept broad recommendations against currently useful clinical tools. Although the development of noninvasive techniques has diminished the frequency of more invasive approaches, advocating their use to replace Wada testing and CSM across all epilepsy surgery programs without consideration of the different skills, protocols, and expertise at any given center site is ill-advised. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2014 International League Against Epilepsy...|$|E

We present a new hyperuniversal switch box designs with four sides and terminals on each side, which is routable for every multipin net-routing requirement. This new design is proved to be optimum for a I FFF S and close to optimum for T with T &quot;Q switches. We also give a formal analysis and extensive benchmark experiments on routability comparisons between today’s most well-known FPGA switch boxes like disjoint switch blocks (Xilinx XC 4000 Type), Wilton’s switch blocks, <b>Universal</b> <b>switch</b> blocks, and our Hyperuniversal switch boxes. We apply the design scheme to rearrangeable switching network designs targeting for applications of connecting multiple terminals (e. g., teleconferencing). Simply using a-sided hyperuniversal switch block with a crossbar attached to each side, one can build a three-stage one-sided polygonal switching network capable of realizing every multipoint connection requirement on terminals. Besides, due to the fine-grained decomposition property of our design scheme, the new switch box designs are highly scalable and simple on physical layout and routing algorithm implementations.

40|$|Determining the {{regulation}} of metabolic networks at genome scale is a hard task. It has been hypothesized that biochemical pathways and metabolic networks might have undergone an evolutionary process of optimization with respect to several criteria over time. In this contribution, a multi-criteria approach {{has been used to}} optimize parameters for the allosteric regulation of enzymes in a model of a metabolic substrate-cycle. This has been carried out by calculating the Pareto set of optimal solutions according to two objectives: the proper direction of flux in a metabolic cycle and the energetic cost of applying the set of parameters. Different Pareto fronts have been calculated for eight different "environments" (specific time courses of end product concentrations). For each resulting front the so-called knee point is identified, which can be considered a preferred trade-off solution. Interestingly, the optimal control parameters corresponding to each of these points also lead to optimal behaviour in all the other environments. By calculating the average of the different parameter sets for the knee solutions more frequently found, a final and optimal consensus set of parameters can be obtained, which is an indication on the existence of a universal regulation mechanism for this system. The implications from such a <b>universal</b> regulatory <b>switch</b> are discussed in the framework of large metabolic networks...|$|R

40|$|A central {{question}} in developmental biology is how multicellular organisms coordinate cell division and differentiation to determine organ size. In Arabidopsis roots, this balance {{is controlled by}} cytokinin-induced expression of SHORT HYPOCOTYL 2 (SHY 2) in the so-called transition zone of the meristem, where SHY 2 negatively regulates auxin response factors (ARFs) by protein-protein interaction. The resulting down-regulation of PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers is considered the key event in promoting differentiation of meristematic cells. Here we show that this regulation involves additional, intermediary factors and is spatio-temporally constrained. We found that the described cytokinin-auxin crosstalk antagonizes BREVIS RADIX (BRX) activity in the developing protophloem. BRX is an auxin-responsive target of the prototypical ARF MONOPTEROS (MP), a key promoter of vascular development, and transiently enhances PIN 3 expression to promote meristem growth in young roots. At later stages, cytokinin induction of SHY 2 in the vascular transition zone restricts BRX expression to down-regulate PIN 3 and thus limit meristem growth. Interestingly, proper SHY 2 expression requires BRX, which could reflect feedback on the auxin responsiveness of SHY 2 because BRX protein can directly interact with MP, likely acting as a cofactor. Thus, cross-regulatory antagonism between BRX and SHY 2 could determine ARF activity in the protophloem. Our data suggest a model in which the regulatory interactions favor BRX expression in the early proximal meristem and SHY 2 prevails because of supplementary cytokinin induction in the later distal meristem. The complex equilibrium of this regulatory module might represent a <b>universal</b> <b>switch</b> in the transition toward differentiation in various developmental contexts...|$|E

The generic optimum <b>universal</b> <b>switch</b> block design problem is to design a (k, W) -USB with the minimum number of switches for every pair of (k, W). This problem was first proposed and solved for k = 4 in Chang et al. [1996], and then solved for even W or for k ≤ 6 in Shyu et al. [2000] and Fan et al. [2002 b]. No optimum (k, W) -USB is known for k ≥ 7 and odd W ≥ 3. But it is already known that when W is a large odd number, a near-optimum (k, W) -USB can be obtained by a disjoint union of (W − f 2 (k)) / 2 copies of the optimum (k, 2) -USB and a noncompound (k, f 2 (k)) -USB, where the value of f 2 (k) is unknown for k ≥ 8.

The Arabidopsis genome sequence reveals no RAS small GTPase {{and only}} {{one or a few}} heterotrimeric G proteins, two predominant classes of signaling G proteins found in animals. In contrast, Arabidopsis possesses a unique family of 11 Rop GTPases that belong to the Rho family of small GTPases. Previous studies indicate that Rop controls actin-dependent pollen tube growth and H 2 O 2 -dependent defense responses. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the Rop GTPase acts as a versatile molecular switch in signaling to multiple developmental processes in Arabidopsis. Immunolocalization using a general antibody against the Rop family proteins revealed a ubiquitous distribution of Rop proteins in all vegetative and reproductive tissues and cells in Arabidopsis. The cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter-directed expression of constitutively active GTP-bound rop 2 (CA-rop 2) and dominant negative GDP-bound rop 2 (DN-rop 2) mutant genes impacted many aspects of plant growth and development, including embryo development, seed dormancy, seedling development, lateral root initiation, morphogenesis of lateral organs in the shoot, shoot apical dominance and growth, phyllotaxis, and lateral organ orientation. The rop 2 transgenic plants also displayed altered responses to the exogenous application of several hormones, such as abscisic acid-mediated seed dormancy, auxin-dependent lateral shoot initiation, and brassinolide-mediated hypocotyl elongation. CA-rop 2 and DN-rop 2 expression had opposite effects on most of the affected processes, supporting a direct signaling role for Rop in regulating these processes.

40|$|Background: Treatment with Pis (vs no PIs) and d 4 T (vs other NRTIs) {{have been}} {{independently}} {{associated with higher}} risk of fat wasting (lipoatrophy) in HIV-infected patients. We sought {{to determine whether the}} revision of d 4 T and/or PI-containing regimens to ZDV/ 3 TC/ABC would be safe, efficacious and result in prevention (fat sparing) and/or reversibility (fat restoration) of lipoatrophy. Methods: 40 subjects with stable HIV RNA< 400 copies/mL and taking 1 of 3 baseline regimens, d 4 T/ 3 TC/indinavir, d 4 T/ 3 TC/nelfinavir, and ZDV/ 3 TC/indinavir were randomised to continue therapy or switch d 4 T to ZDV and PI to ABC, such that the <b>universal</b> <b>switch</b> regimen was ZDV/ 3 TC/ABC. Primary endpoints included percentage change from baseline in fat in the legs and arms in whole body DEXA scans at 24 and 48 weeks. Secondary endpoints were HIV RNA concentration, adverse events, abdominal fat in single-cut L 4 CT scans, anthropometric and metabolic parameters. Results: At 48 weeks in intention-to-treat analysis, subjects who switched therapy to ZDV/ 3 TC/ABC had a significant mean percentage increase from baseline in percentage of leg fat (+ 0. 45) compared with a mean decrease (- 0. 45) in those who continued any of the baseline regimens (p= 0. 03, t-test). There was also an average increase in percentage of arm fat in the switch groups (+ 0. 95 at 24 weeks,+ 1. 73 at 48 weeks) compared with + 0. 02 at 24 weeks (p= 0. 05, t-test) and + 0. 66 at 48 weeks (p= 0. 08, t-test) in the continue groups. The change from baseline in percentage of arm fat observed on those who switched both d 4 T and PI was significantly greater than that observed in those who switched PI alone or continued therapy (p= 0. 01, t-test). No subjects in the switch groups experienced virological failure. For metabolic parameters, there was a mean decrease in LDL cholesterol in those who switched away from indinavir containing regimens (p= 0. 03, t-test). Conclusions: Switching to ZDV/ 3 TC/ABC maintained virologic control and was associated with objective evidence of fat sparing as well as some fat restoration, compared with continued d 4 T and/or PI therapy...|$|E
40|$|The role of cAMP as {{a second}} {{messenger}} in cellular signalling is well established. In the eukaryotic cell the targets of cAMP are PKA, cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels and Epac. All these proteins have a cAMP-binding domain of same architecture in common. Its function is to bind cAMP and thereby sense the presence of cAMP. Binding of cAMP to this sensor domain is transformed into an altered property of the whole protein. In spite of {{the important role of}} cAMP in regulating cellular events, the knowledge on a molecular level of how cAMP binding is translated into protein action was limited so far. For a long time structural information was available only for cAMP-bound (i. e. active) cAMP-binding domains, but information of cAMP free (i. e. inactive) cAMP-binding domains was missing. We determined the cAMP free crystal structure of the regulatory region of Epac 2 containing two cAMP-binding domains. The high conservation of both sequence and structure between Epac and PKA allows to compare these structures as representatives of the ligand bound and the ligand free state of cAMP-binding domains in general. From these analyses a general model was developed of how cAMP-binding is sensed by cAMP-binding domains. A relative small rearrangement of residues directly involved in cAMP binding is transduced to a reorientation of the C-terminal helical part of the cAMP-binding domain. The helices of the different classes of cAMP-regulated proteins have common features related to the rearrangements induced by cAMP and unique features to allow communication to the respective remote parts of the protein. By adaptation of the C-terminal helix to the individual requirements {{in the context of the}} regulated protein class, the cAMP-binding domain can be used as an <b>universal</b> <b>switch</b> unit. The critical importance of this helix for the regulation of PKA, CAP and cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels is described in the literature and was shown for Epac by various approaches in this thesis. In Epac the helix forms an interface interacting with the catalytic region. This interaction blocks the catalytic centre in the absence of cAMP. This binding and therefore the blockage is terminated after binding of cAMP. To complete the structural investigation, extensive biochemical analysis was undertaken. This confirmed already mentioned the importance of the C-terminal helix and corroborated the mechanism suggested for cAMP sensing. In addition, the requirements for productive cAMP-binding and activation were characterised. Thus, the action of Epac specific activators such as 8 -pCPT- 2 -O-Me-cAMP can be explained. This analogue is able to activate Epac with higher efficiency than normal cAMP, but can neither activate nor inhibit PKA. These studies showed also that it is in principle possible to inhibit Epac with certain cAMP analogues. Based on these findings it should be possible to develop Epac specific inhibitors. This will allow the specific investigation of Epac mediated effects...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} self-stabilizing round-robin token management scheme on an anonymous bidirectional ring of identical processors, where each processor is an asynchronous probabilistic (coin-flipping) finite state machine which sends and receives messages. We show that {{the solution to this}} problem is equivalent to symmetry breaking (i. e., leader election). Requiring only constant-size messages and message-passing model has practical implications: our solution can be implemented in high-speed networks using a <b>universal</b> fast hardware <b>switches</b> (i. e., finite state machines) of size independent {{of the size of the}} network. Our automata-based message-passing model has inherent deadlock possibility (i. e., when all processors are waiting for a message) which we assume is detected by an external timeout mechanism. Provided that there is no deadlock to begin with, we show how starting from an arbitrary con guration, the system never enters a deadlock state and further stabilizes in polynomial time. We note that Dijkstra showed that the last problem does not have a deterministic solution (even when the identical processors possess an arbitrary power) : starting from a ring with a multitude of tokens, any deterministic system will either not stabilize or will enter a deadlock state...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{wide variety}} of {{problems}} in signal processing can be formulated such that decisions are made by sequentially taking convex combinations of vector-valued observations and these convex combinations are then multiplicatively compounded over time. A “universal ” approach to such problems might attempt to sequentially achieve {{the performance of the}} best fixed convex combination, as might be achievable noncausally, by observing all of the outcomes in advance. By permitting different piecewise-fixed strategies within contiguous regions of time, the best algorithm in this broader class would be able to switch between different fixed strategies to optimize performance to the changing behavior of each individual sequence of outcomes. Without knowledge of the data length or the number of switches necessary, the algorithms developed in this paper can achieve the performance of the best piecewise-fixed strategy that can choose both the partitioning of the sequence of outcomes in time as well as the best strategy within each time segment. We compete with an exponential number of such partitions, using only complexity linear in the data length and demonstrate that the regret with respect to the best such algorithm is at most (ln ()) in the exponent, where is the data length. Finally, we extend these results to include finite collections of candidate algorithms, rather than convex combinations and further investigate the use of an arbitrary side-information sequence.

40|$|An FPGA {{switch box}} {{is said to}} be {{universal}} (hyper-universal) if it can detailed route all possible surrounding 2 -pin (multi-pin) net topologies satisfying the global routing density constraints. A switch box is optimum if it is hyper-universal and the switches inside is minimum. It has been shown that if the net topology is restricted to 2 -pin nets, then a 2 -D (4 -way) switch box can be built to be <b>universal</b> with only <b>switches,</b> where is the global routing channel density. As the routing resource is relatively expensive in FPGA chips, study of the optimum switch box designs is clearly a topic with theoretical and commercial value of reducing silicon cost. A previous work has constructed a formal mathematical model of this optimum design problem for switch boxes with arbitrary dimensions, and gave a scheme to produce hyper-universal designs with less than 6. 7 W switches for 4 -way FPGA switch boxes. In this paper, we will further investigate this most common 4 -way switch box case, and will give new theoretical results followed by extensive experimental justification. The results seem to be quite attractive. We show that such an optimum switch box can be built with a very low number of additional switches beyond 6 W for today's practical 's (e. g. just plus 1 or 2 additional switches 's up to 7). Even for arbitrary large 's, the bound can be shown to be under 1. To make experimental comparison, we run today's published best FPGA router VPR on large benchmarks for the popular Disjoint structure and our proposed designs. The results are quite encouraging.
