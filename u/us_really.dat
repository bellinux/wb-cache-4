The <b>U.S.</b> <b>really</b> had no formal organization for providing foreign internal defense (FID) assistance, before {{the creation of}} the United States special operations forces. MAAG activities were intended to be largely advisory (i.e., noncombat), while the Special Forces was designed from the beginning for training and leading guerrillas of the host nation against an occupier.|$|E
500|$|Clinton {{opposed the}} Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both {{military}} and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging that the surge had been successful). In March of that year, she {{voted in favor}} of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton {{was one of those who}} voted against it. Clinton responded to General David Petraeus's September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, [...] "I think that the reports that you provide to <b>us</b> <b>really</b> require a willing suspension of disbelief." ...|$|E

500|$|Evil Dead-actor Bruce Campbell was Kripke's {{first choice}} {{to portray the}} character. However, Campbell was unavailable, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan {{eventually}} received the role. Due {{to the fact that}} Morgan's scene in the pilot episode takes place 22 years before the series, Morgan expected to be replaced by an older actor for subsequent episodes. Being only 12 years older than Jensen Ackles, who portrays the eldest son Dean, Morgan was surprised when he was asked to reprise the role. Ackles and Jared Padalecki often teased him about the age difference during filming. Throughout the season, Morgan became frustrated at times due to his character's avoidance of his sons, stating, [...] "It pissed off everybody, it pissed off us as actors, it pissed off the audience watching, because none of <b>us</b> <b>really</b> knew where we were gonna go." [...] However, he reasoned that John's motivation for his actions was due to having knowledge that nobody else had.|$|E
500|$|Absence as a lyrical {{theme is}} common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also {{explored}} unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt {{with the loss of}} youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: [...] "The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling." [...] Waters commented: [...] "it's about none of <b>us</b> <b>really</b> being there... should have been called Wish We Were Here".|$|E
500|$|Eva Bella and Spencer Lacey Ganus {{were cast}} to portray Elsa {{as a young}} child and as a teenager, respectively. Actress and singer Megan Mullally was {{originally}} cast to voice an adult Elsa. but was replaced by Idina Menzel, a Broadway actress and singer best known for performing as Elphaba in Wicked. Menzel already knew Kristen Bell, who voiced Anna, and had previously auditioned for a lead role in the 2010 Disney film Tangled. She was not cast for the part, but the casting director recorded her singing and later showed the recording to Frozens film executives. Menzel was surprised when she was subsequently asked to audition, and she received the role after reading the script out loud. In interviews, she acknowledged similarities between Elsa, her then-current role, and Elphaba, her previous role. Namely, she said, they were both very powerful and very misunderstood individuals. She further said that she related to the characters, having hidden her singing talent from her peers at school. [...] "I didn't want to alienate anyone," [...] she explained. [...] "If everyone was singing along in the car to a Madonna song, I didn't join in because when we're younger we're afraid of sticking out or showing off, when in fact we should own those things that make <b>us</b> <b>really</b> unique." ...|$|E

500|$|... …And Justice for All is a musically {{progressive}} album featuring {{long and}} complex songs, fast tempos and few verse-chorus structures. Metallica decided to broaden its sonic range, writing songs with multiple sections, heavy guitar arpeggios and unusual time signatures. Hetfield later explained: [...] "Songwriting-wise, [...] was just <b>us</b> <b>really</b> showing off {{and trying to}} show what we could do. 'We've jammed six riffs into one song? Let's make it eight. Let's go crazy with it.'" [...] Music critic Simon Reynolds noted the riff changes and experimentation with timing on the album's epically constructed songs: [...] "The tempo shifts, gear changes, lapses, decelerations and abrupt halts". BBC Music's Eamonn Stack wrote that …And Justice for All sounds different from the band's previous albums, with longer songs, sparser arrangements, and harsher vocals by Hetfield. According to journalist Martin Popoff, the album was less melodic than its predecessors because of its frequent tempo changes, unusual song structures and layered guitars. He argued that the album {{is more of a}} progressive metal record because of its intricately performed music and bleak sound. Music writer Joel McIver called the album's music aggressive enough for Metallica to maintain its place with bands [...] "at the mellower end of extreme metal". According to writer Christopher Knowles, Metallica took [...] "the thrash concept to its logical conclusion" [...] on the album.|$|E
500|$|James Berardinelli of ReelViews called Bridge to Terabithia [...] "easily {{the best}} family {{feature of the}} early year". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post praised the script for being [...] "utterly {{recognizable}} and authentic", and thought Robb and Hutcherson were [...] "perfectly cast". Hornaday wrote that although the final five minutes succumbed to [...] "oversweet sentiment", viewers would remember the film's [...] "warmth and respect with which it pays homage to first love". Jessica Grose of The Village Voice commended director Csupó for omitting [...] "cutesy tween stereotypes", and felt Jess's relationship with his father elevated Bridge to Terabithia from [...] "a good kids movie to a classic contender". The New York Times critic Jeannette Catsoulis believed that the fantasy was kept in the background [...] "to find magic in the everyday", and thought Csupó directed [...] "like someone intimate with the pain of being different, allowing each personality {{more than a single}} characteristic". The reviewer praised all the leads for their strong performances, especially Deschanel and Madison. Catsoulis found the film was able to handle adult topics [...] "with nuance and sensitivity", and being consistently smart and [...] "delicate as a spider web", {{it was the kind of}} children's movie [...] "rarely seen nowadays". Miriam di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Hutcherson and Robb's performances, saying that [...] "the film's heart and soul rests on the abilities of its young lead characters to make <b>us</b> <b>really</b> see the world through children's eyes. The dynamic duo of Hutcherson and Robb do not disappoint." ...|$|E

2500|$|The studio {{increased}} the budget from $6.7 to $8.7 million and gave Linklater {{six months to}} finish the film. Pallotta took charge and instituted a more traditional Disney-esque production ethic that included a style manual, strict deadlines, and breaking the film up into smaller segments. The animation process lasted 15 months. Linklater said, {{in regard to the}} post-production problems, [...] "There's a lot of misinformation out there... Changes took place during the early stages of <b>us</b> <b>really</b> getting going on this had everything to do with management and not art. It was a budgetary concern, essentially." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of this eclectic early career, she widened her circle of friends and {{contacts}} beyond those in society and politics with whom she already had close connections. As one of Anthony Eden's biographers put it, she was [...] "equally at home in the worlds of Hatfield and Fitzrovia", while a reviewer of her memoir wrote that [...] "few lives can have touched so many social worlds, or graced them so elegantly". Even so, Lady Avon did not impress everyone: after the future Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher met her at a Conservative Party ball in 1954, she wrote dismissively to her sister, [...] "Mrs Anthony Eden received <b>us.</b> <b>Really</b> she is a most colourless personality".|$|E
2500|$|The broad {{combination}} of styles in the band's music {{has sometimes been}} referred to as [...] "progressive punk" [...] – or [...] "pronk" [...] – and has led to Cardiacs being labelled the primary exponents of this musical style. Tim Smith rejects the term, and prefers the description [...] "psychedelic" [...] or simply [...] "pop". Musicians which the band have cited as Cardiacs influences include XTC, Van der Graaf Generator, Gong, early Split Enz, Devo, Gentle Giant, Alberto Y Los Trios Paranoias, early Genesis, Deaf School and Wire. Smith has stated, [...] "I don’t know what influences <b>us</b> <b>really,</b> I wouldn’t say that we are influenced by any actual bands in particular".

2500|$|A poll in late May 1988 {{found that}} a {{majority}} of voters were not concerned with whether or not a candidate had a controversial member within their family - a reference to Rosenberg's brother Erhard. The poll, conducted by Chapman University's Chapman College Survey group for The Orange County Register, showed Cox leading in the Republican primary with 15 percent to Rosenberg's 13 percent. 57 percent of voters polled were undecided. Of those that were decided, 36 percent supported Cox, while 30 percent supported Rosenberg. [...] "I think the undecideds will break out {{along the lines of the}} people who have already decided," [...] he said. [...] "We'll get the lion's share. The momentum is all going in the right direction," [...] said Cox. Rosenberg commented on the large number of undecided voters: [...] "What it points out is none of <b>us</b> <b>really</b> has gotten our message out," [...] he said.

2500|$|Rowling {{has stated}} that Harry's {{character}} flaws include anger and impulsiveness; however, Harry is also innately honourable. [...] "He's not a cruel boy. He's competitive, and he's a fighter. He doesn't just lie down and take abuse. But he does have native integrity, which makes him a hero to me. He's a normal boy but with those qualities most of <b>us</b> <b>really</b> admire." [...] For the most part, Harry shows humility and modesty, often downplaying his achievements; though he uses a litany of his adventures as examples of his maturity early in the fifth book. However, these very same accomplishments are later employed {{to explain why he}} should lead Dumbledore's Army, at which point he asserts them as having just been luck, and denies that they make him worthy of authority. After the seventh book, Rowling commented that Harry has the ultimate character strength, which not even Voldemort possesses: the acceptance of the inevitability of death.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} intellectual and political influences on Sullivan is Michael Oakeshott. Sullivan describes Oakeshott's thought as [...] "an anti-ideology, a nonprogramme, a {{way of looking at the}} world whose most perfect expression might be called inactivism." [...] He argues [...] "that Oakeshott requires us to systematically discard programmes and ideologies and view each new situation sui generis. Change should only ever be incremental and evolutionary. Oakeshott viewed society as resembling language: it is learned gradually and without <b>us</b> <b>really</b> realising it, and it evolves unconsciously, and for ever." [...] In 1984, he wrote that Oakeshott offered [...] "a conservatism which ends by affirming a radical liberalism." [...] This [...] "anti-ideology" [...] is perhaps the source of accusations that Sullivan [...] "flip-flops" [...] or changes his opinions to suit the whims of the moment. He has written, [...] "A true conservative—who is, above all, an anti-ideologue—will often be attacked for alleged inconsistency, for changing positions, for promising change but not a radical break with the past, for pursuing two objectives—like liberty and authority, or change and continuity—that seem to all ideologues as completely contradictory." ...|$|E
