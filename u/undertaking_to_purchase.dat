500|$|The Times had inaccurately {{described}} the medal as [...] "the first commemorative medal {{to be issued}} {{in the history of}} the mint". [...] The publicity people for the celebration had billed it as the first medal to be issued pursuant to an act of Congress, but in October 1925, Mint Director Robert J. Grant learned that a medal had been authorized by Congress for the centennial of American independence in 1876, and it had been issued in different sizes. He informed Kvale, who was intrigued by the fact that the independence medal had been issued in a 3-inch (76mm) size. The congressman felt that the larger size would allow the detail of his medal to be better shown, which would help when one was exhibited in a museum display case. Not all members of his board were enthusiastic about the idea, but between 60 and 75 of these larger medals were struck, likely in December at the Philadelphia Mint, with Kvale <b>undertaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> any that were not sold. They were plated in silver by a private firm in Washington, D.C., and about 30 were presented or mailed to dignitaries, including one to President Coolidge.|$|E

50|$|In 1846 {{promoters}} {{were planning}} to submit a Parliamentary Bill for a Paisley, Barrhead and Hurlet Railway and the provisional directors <b>undertook</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> the Paisley and Renfrew line. The offer was in effect guaranteed by the GPK&AR, and when the Paisley, Barrhead and Hurlet line failed to get authorisation, the GPK&AR intervened directly. Its purchase of the Paisley and Renfrew line was ratified on 22 July 1847. The Act of 1847 authorised the conversion of its track to standard gauge. The purchase price was £34,000.|$|R
5000|$|The 1846 {{authorisation}} {{was hardly}} practicable, {{and in the}} 1847 Parliamentary session a further Bill was presented, after consideration with Houldsworth (as the dominant potential customer) as to the way forward. With the Glasgow and Belfast Union Railway scheme abandoned, the A&GR now needed to build from Ayr instead of Smithston. The GPKA&R <b>undertook</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> the shares for £100,500, and the A&GR <b>undertook</b> <b>to</b> construct the section between Drumgrange, near Waterside, and Sillyhole as a first priority, to give Houldsworth {{the connection between the}} iron workings and the works, that he required. The distance was about 2 miles (about 3 km), and the section was [...] "to be given over to company to be worked by horsepower".|$|R

The 2002 plan agreed that the two sections would have different owners (Railtrack for section1, LCR for section2) but with common Railtrack management. Following further financial problems at Railtrack, its interest was sold back to LCR, which then sold the operating rights for the completed line to Network Rail, Railtrack's successor. Under this arrangement LCR became the sole owner of both sections of the CTRL and the St Pancras property, as per the original 1996 plan.

50|$|DayStar Technologies, Inc. is a {{publicly}} traded solar energy company located in Santa Clara, California. Its primary product is a thin film photovoltaic material on a glass or plastic substrate. These thin film solar modules are manufactured using copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS), which has shown a 19.5% NREL efficiency in real world conditions, slightly above CdTe and significantly above amorphous silicon.As part of their initiative to become a more integrated global renewable energy company, Daystar <b>undertook</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> Eco Energy Solutions Australia Pty Ltd on June 4, 2012 with a binding letter of intent. Daystar failed to consummate the transaction by tendering cash and shares as per this agreement. As a result, the Managing Director of Eco Energy Solutions and Daystar Technologies board member were forced to place Eco Energy Solutions into liquidation. This resulted in the lodgement of a lawsuit in the United States to recover losses from Daystar Technologies International.|$|R

40|$|A {{sustainability}} {{assessment of}} the Western Australian (WA) rangelands identified {{a range of issues}} associated with regional economic decline typical of many marginal rangeland regions in Australia. As part of a regional rejuvenation strategy, the WA state government purchased selected pastoral lease properties for incorporation into the conservation estate. It was intended as a means of land-use transition from mono-functional productivism to multi-functionality incorporating protection of significant rangeland bioregions and development of tourism. A 1 -year project was conducted to assess the issues relating to this transition. Archived information was obtained from government relating to the characteristics of the lease properties at the time they were purchased. Site visits were <b>undertaken</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchased</b> leases acquired by the government as well as neighbouring leases. During site visits, interviews with pastoralists and purchased lease managers were conducted. A series of facilitated community discussion groups in the region was held to ascertain the views of landholders and managers, government representatives, indigenous interests and commercial operators in the region. This paper describes how the transition to a combination of protection and consumption exchanged one set of problems for another. This was due partly to the intrinsic character of the land, in terms of previous overgrazing, isolation, large distances, and limited infrastructure and services. More importantly, the top-down approach to land transition failed to allocate adequate management resources to replace those lost when the former pastoral leaseholders left. The consequences of inadequate management included theft and rapid degradation of assets, inadequate control of pests and weeds; inadequate fire prevention management and poor communication between the government and other stakeholders over management decisions. This paper discusses the dynamics of this WA rangeland transition with reference to the multi-functional rural transition concept...|$|R
50|$|Milk chose a {{location}} on the Kankakee River for his homestead. In 1868, he opened a general store in Chebanse, Illinois, which he oversaw until selling his interest in 1883. He continued to expand his holdings until he owned over 25000 acre over {{one hundred and fifty}} farms, making him the largest landowner in the state. Milk specialized in raising Hereford cattle and Percheron horses. In the late 1870s, Milk founded the Waldron Ice Company, which harvested ice from the Kankakee River. Milk was President of the Mound City Cemetery in Kankakee, Illinois from 1882 until his death. Milk's most ambitious <b>undertaking</b> was <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> and drain Beaver Lake in Newton County, Indiana. However, this move was rejected by the state, who argued that they only sold the shoreline to the lake and not the entire property. In Indiana vs. Milk, the Supreme Court of Indiana ruled that the state also sold the land under the lake in the transaction.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} reports an in-depth {{study of the}} due diligence activities that prospective independent small business operators and franchisees in Australia <b>undertake</b> prior <b>to</b> <b>purchasing</b> or starting up their businesses. Although academic literature and industry publications promote undertaking ‘proper due diligence’, {{there is a lack}} of empirical research into the nature of due diligence and its effect on business outcomes. Using a qualitative approach, 60 currently and formerly operating independents and franchisees were personally interviewed, exploring the diversity of approaches <b>to</b> <b>undertaking</b> due diligence prior to entering business. The research revealed that differences occur in both the type and amount of due diligence undertaken by independents and franchisees and highlighted further differences between current and former operators. In general, the due diligence undertaken by participants was relatively unsophisticated with few exceptions of rigour and planning. Where prospective independents and franchisees were entering business for the first time, their appreciation of business was naïve. A steep learning curve followed during which they often recognised flaws in their initial research. As a result of this qualitative in-depth research, we present a set of propositions regarding due diligence and a model for future testing on a large sample. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Until 1935, Federal Reserve Banks {{from time}} <b>to</b> time <b>purchased</b> {{short-term}} securities {{directly from the}} United States Treasury to facilitate Treasury cash management operations. The authority <b>to</b> <b>undertake</b> such <b>purchases</b> provided a robust safety net that ensured Treasury could meet its obligations even {{in the event of}} an unforeseen depletion of its cash balances. Congress prohibited direct purchases in 1935, but subsequently provided a limited wartime exemption in 1942. The exemption was renewed from time to time following the conclusion of the war but ultimately was allowed to expire in 1981. This paper addresses three questions: 1) Why did Congress prohibit direct purchases in 1935 after they had been utilized without incident for eighteen years, 2) why did Congress provide a limited exemption in 1942 instead of simply removing the prohibition, and 3) why did Congress allow the exemption to expire in 1981...|$|R

40|$|Terrestrial laser {{scanners}} {{are becoming}} more and more a part of the surveying industry. The high speed, remote capture of considerable amounts of quality data has made the scanner an attractive and valuable surveying instrument. To date most of the uses for a scanner have been surface based applications. This paper investigates the feasibility of using a scanner at BHPB Cannington underground mine to replace traditional survey measurements. The increased speed of remote data capture could contribute to a safer operation and the increased quantity of data would lead to more accurate 3 -dimensional models which could contribute to better reconciliation and mine design. To this end a number survey tasks were undertaken in the underground environment. The methodology used was to compare surveys of a stope and drive carried out with a scanner to that of surveys carried out with traditional measurements. Aspects of practicality and data were examined. The study found that it is feasible to use a scanner underground but a financial rationalization study would need <b>to</b> be <b>undertaken</b> <b>to</b> justify the <b>purchase</b> of a scanner...|$|R

The interpretation is that they differ only in some characteristic that is entirely irrelevant from a welfare perspective. There are no systematic differences between people with the same income. Taking two samples of people from an income class their political support will be identically distributed. We will show that even with these uniformity assumptions there can be strong incentives for political parties <b>to</b> <b>undertake</b> vote <b>purchasing</b> by favouring one of the identical groups {{at the expense of the}} other...|$|R
