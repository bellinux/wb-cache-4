25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the discontinuation of PSP, the Chinese electronics company Lenkeng released a PSP to HDMI converter called the LKV-8000. The device {{is compatible with the}} PSP-2000, PSP-3000 and PSP GO, but the AV cable packaged with it requires an adapter to plug into the PSP GO's port. Instead of component RCA plugs, the PSP's YPbPr AV signal is carried through a D-sub 9 cable that screws into the converter box, which then converts the signal from analog to digital and upscales it to 720p through HDMI. Lenkeng also released a variant of the LKV-8000 with a button allowing the user to toggle between 720p and 1080p. To overcome the problems of PSP games being displayed in a small window surrounded by a black boarder, the LKV-8000 featured a Zoom button on the connector itself. This allowed players to fill screen natively, without any need to use the television's zoom function. A few other Chinese companies have also released clones of this <b>upscaler</b> under different names, like the Pyle PSPHD42. The LKV-8000 and its variants have become popular among players and reviewers as the only means of playing and recording PSP gameplay in full screen.|$|E

50|$|An {{external}} video selector {{called the}} VS-1 was sold as an accessory for Series II or III DVD Lifestyle systems. It contains three inputs (component, s-video and composite) and an output (either component, s-video or composite) for the TV. The VS-1 contains an <b>upscaler</b> and allows {{each of its}} inputs to be selected using a dedicated button on the system's remote control.|$|E
40|$|We {{interpret}} convolutional networks as adaptive {{filters and}} combine them with so-called MuxOut layers to efficiently upscale low resolution images. We formalize this interpretation by deriving a linear and space-variant {{structure of a}} convolutional network when its activations are fixed. We introduce general purpose algorithms to analyze a network and show its overall filter effect for each given location. We use this analysis to evaluate two types of image upscalers: deterministic <b>upscalers</b> that target the recovery of details from original content; and second, {{a new generation of}} <b>upscalers</b> that can sample the distribution of upscale aliases (images that share the same downscale version) that look like real content...|$|R
50|$|Devices are {{available}} to convert from composite to other standards such as analog VGA or digital HDMI; such devices may be called <b>upscalers</b> or scan converters, although not all devices with these names will handle composite input. Price and quality vary. A converter with electronics is necessary; a simple cable will not do the job.|$|R
50|$|According to Muneki Shimada, Sony Director of the Second Division of Software Development, the {{original}} PCH-1000 series PlayStation Vita already includes an <b>upscaler</b> that supports up to 1080i resolution, however {{it was decided}} that the idea for video output for {{the original}} Vita was to be scrapped in favor for releasing the PlayStation Vita TV as a separate device for television connectivity. The in-built scaler has been removed from the PCH-2000 series PlayStation Vita model.|$|E
50|$|Like the VS-1, the VS-2 is an {{external}} video selector which includes an <b>upscaler.</b> The main {{difference is the}} inclusion of HDMI and support for 1080p resolution. The VS-2 has no audio return to the media center. So while it can accept full HDMI video it does not accept HDMI audio, requiring a separate audio cable (RCA, Fiber Optic or Digital Coax) from the 3rd party device to connect to the Lifestyles media center.|$|E
5000|$|The DNSe sound {{engine was}} {{replaced}} by the new SoundAlive engine, first introduced in June 2010 on the YP-RB (only available in Korea). However, only a [...] "light" [...] version of the SoundAlive effects is embedded. Several features and settings present in higher-range Samsung players like Clarity, Audio <b>Upscaler,</b> Wise Volume and Level Optimizer are lacking. In the end, the U6 SoundAlive are close to the U5 DNSe 3.0 Core, only the EQ presets are different.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{successful}} chip families sold by Zoran include the Vaddis product line that was {{widely used in}} DVD players, especially in earlier brand-name models with upscaled HDMI output (using Zoran's HDXtreme <b>upscaler</b> chip) and by numerous low-cost manufacturers in China, the COACH image processor/video processor product line for digital cameras that saw widespread adoption among both major brands and lower cost manufacturers in Asia and shipped {{hundreds of millions of}} units, and the SupraHD product line of integrated SoC solutions for LCD TVs, primarily supporting the ATSC and NTSC standards for the US market.|$|E
5000|$|The UI {{is almost}} the same as on the YP-U4 but it is much faster and smoother. The U5 {{introduces}} the [...] "Popcon" [...] characters, the fitness feature and the DNSe 3.0 core sound engine. The fitness feature consists of an estimation of burned calories depending on several parameters, including one's weight and the exercise type (walk slow, walk fast, run slow, run fast, hiking, cycle or yoga). There is no physical sensor so the result may be inaccurate. The DNSe 3.0 core is a [...] "light" [...] version of the usual DNSe 3.0 effects first introduced on the YP-Q1. Several features and settings like Clarity, Audio <b>Upscaler,</b> Wise Volume and Level Optimizer are lacking here, making the core version of the DNSe 3.0 worse than the standard version of the DNSe 2.0 embedded in the previous YP-U4 and several other players.|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{presents}} a fast Super-Resolution (SR) algorithm {{based on a}} selective patch processing. Motivated by the observation that some regions of images are smooth and unfocused and can be properly upscaled with fast interpolation methods, we locally estimate the probability of performing a degradation-free upscaling. Our proposed framework explores the usage of supervised machine learning techniques and tackles the problem using binary boosted tree classifiers. The applied <b>upscaler</b> is chosen based on the obtained probabilities: (1) A fast <b>upscaler</b> (e. g. bicubic interpolation) for those regions which are smooth or (2) a linear regression SR algorithm for those which are ill-posed. The proposed strategy accelerates SR by only processing the regions which benefit from it, thus not compromising quality. Furthermore all the algorithms composing the pipeline are naturally parallelizable and further speed-ups could be obtained. I...|$|E
40|$|A video scaler, is {{a module}} that {{receives}} a picture, enlarge or shrink it, and sends it back. The video scaler {{in this thesis}} was made {{to be part of}} an AXI-Stream Video System thatis suited to be implemented on a FPGA. The system is divided into three parts: the video scaler module, the video module andthe communication module, where the final goal was to use the communication mod-ule to send data from memory, to the video scaler, scale the video up or down, send iteither back to memory or to the video module where it could be displayed on a screenby HDMI/VGA. In the video scaler, an algorithm was used to scale up the images by a factor of 4. Thescaler needs to know the pixel-width and pixel-height of the image prior to the scalingto prevent the scaled image from being distorted or askewed. Width and height caneasily be configured to fit new images. For the downscaling, a form of merging was used to scale down by a factor of 4. It wastested on the same images as the <b>upscaler,</b> and both of the scalers use the same inter-faces since they have to fit into the AXI-Stream Video System. The downscaler was simulated and implemented into a system where it communicatedwith memory, which was running on the FPGA, while the <b>upscaler</b> was only simulated...|$|E
40|$|The Bierwang Field {{has been}} used for gas storage for around 20 years. To obtain a better {{understanding}} of the storage performance of the field, Ruhrgas acquired 3 D seismic data and has undertaken a full field integrated geostatistical modeling study to obtain high resolution reservoir flow models. These models form the basis for dynamic modeling. A multi-disciplinary approach to the modeling was taken with special attention paid to proper integration of seismic with petrophysical and geological data to improve the confidence in the final reservoir models. The full 3 D reservoir models incorporate structure, volumetrics, and properties for dynamic flow modeling (porosity and permeability) based on a detailed rock lithofacies model. Multiple models were generated using geostatistical simulation to capture modeling uncertainty. This set of final static reservoir models were transformed from a seismic grid representation to a cell-based POSC RESCUE (REServoir Characterization Using Epicentre) geologic model format to facilitate transfer to the reservoir model <b>upscaler...</b>|$|E
