This study {{is the first to}} undertake a world-wide analysis of illegal and <b>unreported</b> <b>fishing.</b> Reviewing the situation in 54 countries and on the high seas, we estimate that lower and upper estimates of the total value of current illegal and <b>unreported</b> <b>fishing</b> losses worldwide are between $ 10 bn and $ 23. 5 bn annually, representing between 11 and 26 million tonnes. Our data are of sufficient resolution to detect regional differences in the level and trend of illegal fishing over the last 20 years, and we can report a significant correlation between governance and the level of illegal fishing. Developing countries are most at risk from illegal fishing, with total estimated catches in West Africa being 40 % higher than reported catches. Such levels of exploitation severely hamper the sustainable management of marine ecosystems. Although there have been some successes in reducing the level of illegal fishing in some areas, these developments are relatively recent and follow growing international focus on the problem.

40|$|Madagascar, the world's {{fourth largest}} island, {{is one of}} the world's poorest {{developing}} countries, and its people depend heavily on marine resources for subsistence and income. Exports of these resources and foreign fishing access agreements are also important, at least from a large-scale economic perspective. In recent years, concerns have been voiced amongst local fishers and industry groups regarding the growth of the country's fishing effort. Despite these concerns, existing knowledge of the scale, composition and trends of Malagasy fisheries remains poor, and there is negligible information regarding unreported catches and illegal fishing in Madagascar's waters. Small-scale fisheries, which are often substantial in developing countries such as Madagascar, are often unreported or underestimated. Unfortunately, fisheries legislations, management plans and foreign fishing access agreements are often influenced by these incomplete data, leading to serious over-estimations of resource availability. This also appears to be the situation in Madagascar, where the reconstruction of total catches by all Malagasy fisheries sectors conducted here showed that total catches between 1950 and 2008 were twice the volume reported by national fisheries agencies. Most importantly, much of the subsistence sector is missing from official statistics, and signs of decline have already been observed in several stocks, suggesting that current levels of catches are likely to be exceeding sustainable yields. This has profound implications for the economic and ecological sustainability of fisheries, as well as food security in a country where people rely heavily on the ocean for their daily protein needs and livelihoods.

40|$|The European squid Loligo vulgaris is an {{important}} target species of commercial and recreational fisheries in the NW Mediterranean. Handline jigging {{is one of the}} most common fishing gears used by both of these fisheries to catch squid, which are trapped when they try to seize the lure with their tentacles. An unknown but possibly significant number of squid are able to escape from this gear by losing one or both of their tentacles (drop off rate). Between April and July 2010, two sets of experiments under controlled laboratory conditions were carried out to test (n= 15 squid) the indirect effects of tentacle loss on predation success and predation behaviour. The first set of experiments consisted of estimating the number of attacks and time spent until a squid with no (n= 5), one (n= 5) or two tentacles (n= 5) successfully caught a prey item. Independent trials were carried out with two prey types with very different swimming capabilities (fish and shrimp). The second set of experiments consisted of prey-selectivity trials to determine whether squid prefer fish or shrimp when both are available. The results obtained clearly demonstrate not only that squid missing tentacles have a reduced predation performance but also that they can change predation preferences and predation behaviour. These changes might negatively affect the condition of injured squid (reduced fitness). Consequently, the possibility of squid losing their tentacles deserves more attention in the management decisions for the squid fishery. This indirect handline jigging effect may imply <b>unreported</b> <b>fishing</b> mortality (ghost fishing) that should be considered when making management decisions for this important fishery. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|The Polish {{fishing fleet}} in the Baltic Sea {{consists}} to ca. 70 % of small‐scale vessels and is regulated under the European Union‟s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). With about 2000 rules, the CFP {{is one of}} the most comprehensive fisheries governance agreements worldwide. However, from all the countries surrounding the Baltic Sea, Poland has the highest amount of illegal unregulated and <b>unreported</b> <b>fishing</b> (IUU) as a recent study by Rossing et al. (2010) suggests. In some years, the estimated Polish IUU for cod reaches 300 % of the reported cod landings. This indicates the ineffectiveness of the current fisheries governance system that is especially apparent in Poland for a number of reasons. Despite the transformation from socialist to market oriented society, Poland is still characterized by an authoritarian culture, little experience with deliberative decisionmaking and skepticism and distrust towards EU regulations. Local and regional fishermen‟s organizations hardly exist or are highly fragmented. A unifying voice in policy formation is therefore missing. The so‐called “mazonerias” that managed fisheries as local, co‐operative organizations in the command economy before 1991 have almost completely disappeared. Along with these institutions, the cultural norms of localized collaboration and mutual selfhelp vanished as well. In their places emerged an ideology of pure self‐interested behavior on the part of individual fishermen and minimal legitimacy attributed to coordinating, regulating institutions (Marciniak and Jentoft, 1997) including the scientific advisory system (Stöhr and Chabay, 2010). Against this background this talk presents first findings regarding the establishment and institutionalization of the “Polish Baltic Sea Fisheries Roundtable” (PFRT) as the first attempt to move towards more stakeholder participation in Polish fisheries governance. The PRFT is a forum for Polish Fisheries stakeholders, scientists and administrators to discuss current topics of relevance to the Baltic in order to increase trust between the stakeholders and build social capital. As a cross‐link between the local, national and the EU‐level, the PFRT aims to develop a more coherent and effective Polish voice in the Baltic Sea Regional Advisory Council (BS RAC), to the European Commission and to the Polish government. It started in January 2009 as a joint initiative by a fisherman, an environmentalist, a scientist and our group. The talk highlights the most important steps for the successful initiation of the PRFT in the difficult Polish environment and reflects on the results and challenges that have occurred so far. After 7 conducted meetings the PRFT is on its way to become a well established crosslink between different hierarchical and vertical levels with regular participation of fishermen, environmental NGOs (ENGOs), scientists as well as government and BS RAC representatives. The dialogue among the different stakeholder groups is improving and regarded as useful and relevant by both the stakeholders as well as government officials. However, despite early successes there are also challenges that have not been resolved yet. Among those are the development of consensus‐based PRFT position statements and the participation of PFRT members as advisors in government meetings. From a general perspective, the talk addresses the question of the right development speed for the institutionalization process of participatory instruments such as the PRFT...|$|E
40|$|The Savu Sea in the Province of East Nusa Tenggara is an {{important}} area for marine mammals in Indonesia, supporting at least 19 cetacean species {{as well as the}} dugong. The deep inter-island channels of the Savu Sea are sites of upwellings and other oceanographic processes which benefit marine mammal populations. Two traditional communities (Lamalera village on Lembata Island and Lamakera village on Solor Island) hunt whales in the Savu Sea, a practice which impacts on marine mammal populations but which is poorly documented. Through this research, I examine the current status of the whale hunting cultures in the Savu Sea as well as the social construction or perception of several stakeholders concerning traditional hunting practices. I also analyse other anthropogenic activities that might adversely impact on marine mammals in the region, and provide management options for marine mammal conservation in the Savu Sea and Indonesia in general. To gain preliminary information in {{a relatively short period of}} time, I used a RRA (Rapid Rural Appraisal) approach. I conducted my research between May and December 2004, interviewing 60 informants from various places in Solor, Lembata, Alor and Rote Islands, as well as in Kupang (the capital of East Nusa Tenggara), Jakarta and Bandung (West Java). The nature of my research question resulted in qualitative data that I examined using thematic analysis and social construction theory. I conclude that the whale hunting traditions in Lamalera (Lembata Island) and Lamakera (Solor Island) are subsistence whaling according to the IWC (International Whaling Commission) definition. This tradition appears not to be important anymore for the villagers of Lamakera. However, it is still a very important part of the cultural and spiritual identity of the Lamalera villagers. Although recently the whale catch has been relatively low, the Lamalera fishermen have compensated by increasing the catch of small cetaceans and other marine megafauna such as whale sharks, sunfish, manta rays, etc., confirming their high dependency on non-fish products. The preliminary nature of this research did not allow a calculation of the sustainable harvest level or PBR (Potential Biological Removal) of whale hunting in Lamalera thus this practice is still considered a threat to the local whale population. However, the research revealed that there are many other threats to marine mammals in the Savu Sea that should be considered when designing marine mammal management. These threats include IUU (illegal, unregulated and <b>unreported)</b> <b>fishing,</b> marine traffic, oil-gas exploration and exploitation, and commercial displays of marine mammals. Several management options for marine mammals in Savu Sea are proposed. Further investigation is recommended to fully understand the magnitude of each threat to the marine mammal populations, which in the end will affect traditional whale hunting in Lamalera. This research offers insights into issues that could be included in the recently proposed government plan to establish the Solor-Alor Marine Protected Area. Alternative livelihoods for whale hunters and destructive fishers should be appropriately designed. Alternative fisheries to reduce the dependency of Lamalera villagers on marine megafauna products might also be a feasible option. I recommend that Indonesia consider becoming a signatory to the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). As an international body that facilitates the management of migratory species, CMS can assist Indonesia in management of and research into marine mammals, especially the species targeted by whale hunters. So far, Indonesia is an MOU signatory to the CMS. By becoming a CMS signatory, Indonesia is more likely to engage further collaboration with Australia and other countries that have been conducting extensive research on marine mammals...|$|E
