5|$|In Roanoke, Virginia, Wayne Weinsider (Bruce Campbell) and his {{pregnant}} wife Laura (Lisa Jane Persky) learn via an <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> that their unborn child has bizarre physical abnormalities, such as horn-like protrusions. Weinsider appears to be especially distraught after hearing the news. That night, Laura has a terrifying dream in which a demon-like figure snatches the baby from her womb. When she wakes up, the couple discover that Laura has seemingly miscarried. Laura's brother, local deputy sheriff Arky Stevens, reports her story to the X-Files section at the FBI. Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) discards the report, but Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) salvages the case and travels to Virginia, along with Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to interview the Weinsiders.|$|E
5|$|At Zeus Genetics clinic, Scully overhears a {{pregnant}} woman, Mary Hendershot (Saxon Trainor), who is telling her doctor {{that she does}} not want to be under his care any more. In order to avoid being seen, Scully hides in a storeroom, finding it full of preserved fetuses that resemble the alien child seen earlier, but she is discovered by a doctor, Dr. Lev. Scully then phones Dr. Parenti, who is dissecting an alien fetus. She asks him to compare her <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> with the one given to her earlier. Later, while waiting to be attended to by Dr. Parenti, she has another flashback, recalling the time she sought a second opinion about her ova from Dr. Parenti, and was told that her ova might be viable with a sperm donor. In the present, she is called in to be attended to, and she is then assured her scans are in order. Later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Doggett confront Duffy about threatening letters he has been sending to both Mulder and Dr. Lev. However, when the agents leave, Duffy makes a phone call to Lev, warning him that they are being investigated. In another flashback, Scully asks Mulder to be the donor, to which he happily agrees.|$|E

40|$|Serial <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scans</b> and {{conventional}} and diffusion weighted {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) were performed on 16 neonates who presented with seizures. The Apgar scores were normal and subsequently no metabolic or infective cause could be found. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the extent to which early sequential imaging can elucidate the cause of seizures in apparently neurologically normal infants. Fourteen of the infants had haemorrhagic or ischaemic lesions on MRI and these were detected by <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> in 11. Early <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> detected the haemorrhagic lesions but the ischaemic lesions were often not seen until the end of the first week of life. Early MRI, however, was able to detect all the ischaemic lesions. The evolution of the insult could be timed by using serial <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scans</b> and a combination of diffusion weighted {{and conventional}} MRI during the first week of life, confirming a perinatal insult even in the absence of fetal distress. Although the aetiology of these lesions remains obscure, serial <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scans</b> will detect the presence of cerebral lesions in neonates presenting with isolated seizures but additional MRI sequences will give better definition on type, site, and extent of the pathology...|$|R

To stop Andrew from breaking up with her, Natasha tells him she is pregnant. Michael, though initially angry, tells his daughter that he will support her. Andrew books Natasha in for an <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> and after {{trying to get out}} of it, Natasha buys fake ultrasound images over the internet. She convinces Andrew not to come into the doctor's office with her and she gives him the fake pictures. Summer reveals the images are fake and Natasha explains that she lied because Andrew cheated on her. Michael tells Natasha that he no longer trusts her and she becomes ostracised at school. Natasha is thrown off the Mathletes team and Lisa Devine (Sophie Tilson) takes her place as the most popular girl in the school. Chris befriends Natasha and she and Summer apologise to each other for their actions. Chris and Natasha try to get Summer and Andrew back together and Natasha successfully challenges Lisa for the Mathletes captaincy.|$|E

When she was asked if she had any sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E

25|$|An <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> {{of the hip}} {{can easily}} {{demonstrate}} fluid inside the joint capsule (Fabella sign), although {{this is not always}} present in transient synovitis. However, it cannot reliably distinguish between septic arthritis and transient synovitis. If septic arthritis needs to be ruled out, needle aspiration of the fluid can be performed under ultrasound guidance. In transient synovitis, the joint fluid will be clear. In septic arthritis, there will be pus in the joint, which can be sent for bacterial culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing.|$|E
25|$|Transient {{synovitis}} is {{a diagnosis}} of exclusion. The diagnosis {{can be made in}} the typical setting of pain or limp in a young child who is not generally unwell and has no recent trauma. There is a limited range of motion of the hip joint. Blood tests may show mild inflammation. An <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> of the hip joint can show a fluid collection (effusion). Treatment is with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and limited weight-bearing. The condition usually clears by itself within seven to ten days, but a small group of patients will continue to have symptoms for several weeks. The recurrence rate is 4–17%, most of which is in the first six months.|$|E

40|$|Background: Real-time <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> is {{increasing}} in popularity {{as a teaching}} tool for human anatomy because it is non-invasive, offers real-time 3 -D anatomy and is cheaper than dissections. Aim: To assess real-time <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> as a teaching method of human anatomy, and to determine what teaching methods medical imaging and sonography students consider effective for understanding human anatomy. Method: Surveys were distributed to two consecutive cohorts of first year medical imaging and medical sonography students at CQUniversity. Participation was voluntary. Comparisons among teaching methods were made using repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Real-time <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> was the most preferred method of delivery for anatomy classes overall especially compared to computer programs, videos, 3 -D radiological images and dissection. Specifically, students indicated that <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> was the preferred method to encourage learning from experience (F 7, 231 = 2. 942, p = 0. 006), to develop team skills (F 7, 231 = 4. 550, p < 0. 006), to follow complex instructions (F 7, 231 = 4. 656 p < 0. 001) and to appreciate anatomical variation (F 7, 231 = 2. 067, p = 0. 048). Dissection was the least favoured teaching method. Conclusion: Real-time <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> is {{a useful tool for}} teaching anatomy, and animal dissections are a poor substitute for the use of human cadavers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> is {{provided}} by a range of health professionals {{who need to be}} trained to a proficient level. In respect of education and training in <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning,</b> little attention has been given to how scanning skills are acquired and what assists and hinders the learning process. This study aims to develop a framework for guiding learning in <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning.</b> Overt participant observation and semi-structured interviews generated data on four learners undertaking a 12 -month postgraduate ultrasound programme. Narrative analysis of the interview data was used to reveal dominant themes related to stages in learning to scan. Dominant themes associated with learning to scanwere communication with the patient, navigation skills, image interpretation skills, observation of expert practice, feedback on performance and random practise. Detailed interpretation of the themes through narrative analys{{is provided}} characteristics of learning for each stage of a four staged process. This study provides an insight into the key features of scan performance and how scanning skills are acquired over a four-staged approach.

40|$|Objective To {{perform a}} {{systematic}} review evaluating {{the value of}} abdominal radiography, colonic transit time (CTT), and rectal <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> in the diagnosis of idiopathic constipation in children. Study design Eligible studies were those assessing diagnostic accuracy of abdominal radiography, CTT, or rectal <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> in children suspected for idiopathic constipation. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed with the Quality Assessment of studies of Diagnostic Accuracy included in Systematic reviews checklist. Results One systematic review summarized 6 studies on abdominal radiography until 2004. The additional 9 studies evaluated abdominal radiography (n = 2), CTT (n = 3), and <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> (n = 4). All studies except two used a case-control study design, which will lead to overestimation of test accuracy. Furthermore, none of the studies interpreted {{the results of the}} abdominal radiography, <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning,</b> or CTT without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis of constipation. The sensitivity of abdominal radiography, as studied in 6 studies, ranged from 80 % (95 % CI, 65 - 90) to 60 %(95 % CI, 46 - 72), and its specificity ranged from 99 %(95 % CI, 95 - 100) to 43 %(95 % CI, 18 - 71). Only one study presented test characteristics of CTT, and two studies presented test characteristics of ultrasonography.

40|$|Previous {{analyses}} of prenatal screening for neural tube defects have generally found benefits to exceed costs. The usual screening battery follows an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level with high-resolution ultrasound and/or amniocentesis. Current thinking focuses on weighing {{the risk of}} a false-negative (an abnormality missed) against {{the risk of a}}n amniocentesis-induced fetal loss. This thinking neglects the risk of a false-positive (an unaffected fetus labeled abnormal) and individual parents 2 ̆ 7 preferences concerning a false-negative vs a fetal loss. With these risks included, we find that high-resolution ultrasound is appropriate for all women with elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein. Women with moderately elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein who have negative <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scans</b> need no further testing, nor do women with highly elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein and positive <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scans.</b> Further testing using amniocentesis to confirm the ultrasound result is appropriate for women with moderately elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein and positive <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scans,</b> and for women with highly elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein and negative <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scans.</b> The actual cutoffs defining normal, moderately elevated, and highly elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein depend on several parameters, particularly the underlying prevalence of neural tube defects and the parents 2 ̆ 7 preferences...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of routine <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> in pregnancy by a meta-analysis of various outcome measures. DESIGN [...] Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of routine <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> on perinatal mortality and morbidity. Live birth rate (that is, live births per pregnancy) is included as a measure of pregnancy outcome in addition to the conventional perinatal mortality. SUBJECTS [...] 15, 935 pregnancies (7992 in which routine <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> was used and 7943 controls with selective scanning) from four randomised controlled trials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Perinatal mortality, live birth rate, rate of miscarriage, Apgar score < 7 at 1 minute, and number of induced labours. RESULTS [...] The live birth rate was identical in both screening and control groups (odds ratio = 0. 99; 95 % confidence interval 0. 88 to 1. 12) although the perinatal mortality was significantly lower in the group who had routine ultrasonography (0. 64, 0. 43 to 0. 97). Differences in perinatal morbidity between the two groups as measured by the proportion of newborn babies with Apgar score < 7 at 1 minute were not significant (1. 05; 0. 93 to 1. 19). CONCLUSION [...] Routine <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> does not improve the outcome of pregnancy in terms of an increased number of live births or of reduced perinatal morbidity. Routine <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> may be effective and useful as a screening for malformation. Its use for this purpose, however, should be made explicit and take into account the risk of false positive diagnosis in addition to ethical issues...|$|R
