5|$|The climb <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down</b> {{from the}} summit plateau onto Swirral Edge is another well known {{accident}} spot.

5|$|Range {{queries are}} also straightforward. Once {{the ranks of}} the two values are known, the number of {{elements}} {{greater than or equal to}} the first value and less than the second is the difference of the two ranks. This count can be adjusted <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down</b> by one according to whether the endpoints of the range should be considered to be part of the range and whether the array contains keys matching those endpoints.|$|E

5|$|The Stern–Gerlach {{experiment}} of 1922 provided {{further evidence}} of the quantum nature of the atom. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is random, the beam could be expected to spread into a line. Instead, the beam was split into two parts, depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|The current fifth {{edition of}} the Stanford–Binet scales (SB5) was {{developed}} by Gale H. Roid and published in 2003 by Riverside Publishing. Unlike scoring on previous versions of the Stanford–Binet test, SB5 IQ scoring is deviation scoring in which each standard deviation <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down</b> from the norming sample median score is 15 points from the median score, IQ 100, just like the standard scoring on the Wechsler tests.|$|E
5|$|Citizen's Briefing Book {{is a work}} of {{suggestions}} by individuals compiled into a book format and submitted to President Barack Obama after his inauguration on January 20, 2009. Internet users originally posted their suggestions at Change.gov, with the plan that after Barack Obama was sworn in as President the website hosting the recommendations would direct users to Whitehouse.gov. The option to participate in the request for comment format was open until January 20, 2009, where users were able to post suggestions to the President, read others' recommendations, and comment on each other's ideas. Users voted on individual recommendations with an <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down</b> vote for each suggestion.|$|E

5|$|In Flow, {{the player}} guides a small, multi-segmented worm- or snake-like {{creature}} through an aquatic environment. There are no menus or guidelines; the game begins immediately. The game world, which is viewed from a top-down perspective, consists of two-dimensional planes stacked vertically upon each other. A blurred {{version of the}} layer below appears {{in the background of}} each plane. Planes contain organisms of varying sizes; the player's creature automatically attempts to consume them when they are nearby. The majority of these creatures are non-confrontational, and are composed of cells that increase the number of segments in the player's creature when eaten. All planes, except for the highest and lowest, contain two specially colored organisms that move the player's creature <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down</b> one plane when touched.|$|E
5|$|Monodontids {{consist of}} two species: the beluga and the narwhal. They both {{reside in the}} frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber. Belugas, being white, hunt in large pods near the surface and around pack ice, their {{coloration}} acting as camouflage. Narwhals, being black, hunt in large pods in the aphotic zone, but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged when something is looking directly <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down</b> at them. They have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with pack ice.|$|E

5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down</b> ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.|$|E
5|$|Several of the animal's {{physical}} features are adaptions to climbing through trees. It uses its tail to assist balance and has semi-retractable claws that it uses to climb trees in its search for prey. It has semiplantigrade feet, switching between a plantigrade-like gait (when arboreal) and a digitigrade-like one (when terrestrial). The soles of its paws are nearly bare {{and covered with}} strong pads. The fossa has very flexible ankles that allow it to readily grasp tree trunks so as to climb <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down</b> trees head first or to leap to another tree. Captive juveniles {{have been known to}} swing upside down by their hindfeet from knotted ropes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, if the price of a security goes <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down</b> and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E

5|$|The Differential Ability Scales Second Edition (DAS–II) was {{developed}} by Colin D. Elliott and published in 2007 by Psychological Corporation. The DAS-II is a test battery given individually to children, normed for children from ages two years and six months through seventeen years and eleven months. It was normed on 3,480 noninstitutionalized, English-speaking children in that age range. The DAS-II yields a General Conceptual Ability (GCA) score scaled like an IQ score with the median standard score set at 100 and 15 standard score points for each standard deviation <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down</b> from the median. The lowest possible GCA score on DAS–II is 44, and the highest is 175.|$|E
5|$|The Ising {{model is}} used to model the {{behavior}} of magnetic systems. It consists of an array of cells, the state of each of which represents a spin, either <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down.</b> The energy {{of the system is}} measured by a function that depends on the number of neighboring pairs of cells that have the same spin as each other. Therefore, if a cell has equal numbers of neighbors in the two states, it may flip its own state without changing the total energy. However, such a flip is energy-conserving only if no two adjacent cells flip at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Allosaurus, as {{interpreted}} from spiral CT scanning of an endocast, was {{more consistent with}} crocodilian brains {{than those of the}} other living archosaurs, birds. The structure of the vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down.</b> The structure of the inner ear was like that of a crocodilian, and so Allosaurus probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The olfactory bulbs were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.|$|E

5|$|The {{control pad}} {{may be used}} to move the hero in any {{direction}} and to move the flashing cursor in menu displays. Additional buttons confirm and cancel commands. In the English version, players use menu commands to talk to people, check their status, search beneath their feet, use items, take treasure chests, open doors, and go <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down</b> stairs. However, in some of the game's later remakes, certain commands were assigned to buttons, navigating stairs became automatic, and the hero's speed was increased. In the Japanese version, characters always face forward, so players must choose a command and then a direction in which to perform that action. In the North American version, the hero turns to face the direction he is moving, making direction selection unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} the protagonist Leon S. Kennedy from a third-person perspective. The gameplay focuses on action and shootouts involving crowds of enemies in large open areas but still features some Horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms {{in for an}} over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms, instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down,</b> players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons, and headshots instantly kill most human enemies. Players can shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.|$|E
5|$|In Roman {{constitutional}} law, the assemblies are {{a sovereign}} authority, {{with the power}} to enact or reject any law, confer any magistracies, and make any decision. In fact, with a single law, they held the authority to override the norms and precedents of the Republic as well as ancient laws long unchanged. There are two necessary components to any assembly: (1) the convening magistrate and (2) the citizens in the assembly itself. Assemblies did not participate or discuss matters laid before them, they heard the speakers put forth by the presiding officer. And after such discussion, the presiding officer could call for a direct <b>up</b> <b>or</b> <b>down</b> vote. Without a magistrate, there would be nobody to legally call upon the assembly; and without the citizens, there is naught but a magistrate.|$|E
