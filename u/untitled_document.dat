This is a pity because this name would suit the demiurge risen from chaos to a nicety. And perhaps the author of the <b>Untitled</b> <b>Document</b> did not know Aramaic and also supposed as we did once, that baoth {{had something to do with}} tohuwabohu, one of the few Hebrew words that everybody knows. ... It would seem then that the Orphic view of the demiurge was integrated into Jewish Gnosticism even before the redaction of the myth contained in the original Apocryphon of John. ... Phanes is represented with the mask of a lion's head on his breast, while from his sides the heads of a ram and a buck are budding forth: his body is encircled by a snake. This type was accepted by the Mithras mysteries, to indicate Aion, the new year, and Mithras, whose numerical value is 365. Sometimes he is also identified with Jao Adonai, the creator of the Hebrews. His hieratic attitude indicates Egyptian origin. The same is true of the monstrous figure with the head of a lion, which symbolises Time, Chronos, in Mithraism; Alexandrian origin of this type is probable.|$|E

40|$|HTML> <b>Untitled</b> <b>Document</b> A b s t r a c t The aim of {{the present}} study is to give a {{theoretical}} and practical basis for teaching "Visual Literacy" in the framework of media education with emphasis on computer animation. Because of the technical possibility of reproduction and diffusion of pictures, the visual media have gained a stronger influence on our everyday life. The pictures diffused by the media do not directly reflect external reality, they rather create a fictive and simulated reality. These pictures may have a direct influence on the perception and behavior of the children and young persons of today. Hence it is necessary to analyze the effects of these pictures in the framework of media education. "Visual Literacy" offers a new approach for competent dealing with visual media. An intentional promotion of "Visual Literacy" in the framework of media education has up to now been not explicitly taken into consideration. In the present study, a special field of "Visual Literacy", namely computer animation, has been chosen for investigation because digital moving pictures play an increasing role in our media environment today and in the future. The didactic research into computer animation as a special field of "Visual Literacy" has been carried out during art lessons because art is the only school subject which uses pictures for gestalt purposes. The hypothesis for the empirical investigation has been evolved {{on the basis of the}} various fields of "Visual Literacy" with special reference to computer animation. The hypothesis was formulated as follows: As a result of practical dealing with computer animation, the schoolchildren involved in the study may acquire or improve their capacity for conscious perception, critical reception, adequate and meaningful use and of self-reliant and creative shaping during art lessons. The results of the study show that the practical media work during art lessons in the test period promoted the development and the improvement of "Visual Literacy" in schoolchildren involved in the study. On the basis of this investigation the hypotheses should however be tested with a larger sample of students. The present study is a successful contribution to the integration of "Visual Literacy" in the media education field and to further development of media education oriented towards art and aesthetics. Shaping and aesthetically dealing with computer animation during art lessons, as has been investigated in the present study, offers a theoretical and practical new media-didactical approach which may stimulate further research. </HTML...|$|E
40|$|<b>Untitled</b> <b>Document</b> Trail {{following}} behaviour of Dolichovespula saxonica, Vespula vulgaris and Vespa crabro (Vespinae) {{was investigated}} in experiments with an artificial tunnel system. D. saxonica that typically has free nests was found to produce trail pheromones used for nest orientation while walking through the tunnel system as it was known from the obligate cavity breeding species V. crabro and V. vulgaris (chapter 3). In V. vulgaris and D. saxonica, the trail is used for nest orientation mainly by young, inexperienced foragers. Experienced foragers orient themselves visually. Under reduced light regime, they also orient chemically. In V. crabro, however, the majority of foragers use the trail for orientation irrespectively of the light regime (chapter 4). In contrast to V. crabro the terrestrial trails of D. saxonica and V. vulgaris are not colony specific (chapter 5). These differences in trail following behaviour between V. crabro and V. vulgaris despite their similar nest habitats are {{probably due to the}} convergent evolution of cavity breeding in both species. This assumption is supported by phylogenetic data obtained from other authors. Chemical analysis of the trail of V. vulgaris revealed that it consists exclusively of hydrocarbons (C 22 -C 35) that are also found on the cuticle and in the profile of the nest odour. Most likely, the hydrocarbons are transferred by foragers passively from their cuticles to the substrate while walking outside the nest. In this way the nest odour is lengthened as a trail and used for nest orientation. This hypothesis may also apply to V. crabro and could easily explain the existence of a trail in D. saxonica (chapter 6). Biotests with V. vulgaris demonstrate the temporal change of the nest odour. Nestmates removed from the nest and frozen for 17 days were not accepted as colony members and were attacked. On the contrary, nestmates only frozen for few hours were attacked significantly less frequently. In experiments with two V. vulgaris-nests in a twin nest box before and after they were kept simultaneously in the same aerial space it was shown that the change of nest odour can be induced by an exchange of volatile compounds via the aerial surroundings the nest. 10 days after the two colonies had been placed in the same aerial space, members of the neighbouring colony were treated with a similar low rate of aggression as nestmates. Before the two nests were kept together the rate of aggression was significantly higher between both colonies. Since a direct contact of the members of both colonies was prevented, the exchange of volatile compounds was the only possibility for the mutual adjustment of the nest odours (chapter 7). Despite the precise ability of V. vulgaris to distinguish colony members from alien individuals the parasitoide beetle M. paradoxus is able to stay inside the V. vulgaris host colony without being attacked by the wasps. Whether this is achieved by chemical mimicry {{was investigated in}} chemical analyses of the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of the beetle and V. vulgaris. Only 29 of the 95 cuticular compounds of V. vulgaris could be found in M. paradoxus. Thus, the parasitoide does not mimic the whole hydrocarbon profile of the host. However, biotest data show that a beetle from the own nest was attacked less frequently by V. vulgaris-foragers than a beetle from an alien colony. Among the 29 cuticular hydrocarbons of M. paradoxus that are also found on the cuticle of V. vulgaris, there could be key substances mimicking the colony specific quantities of the corresponding compounds of V. vulgaris. The congruence of these key compounds may feign a colony membership of the beetle (chapter 8). </body...|$|E
40|$|<b>Untitled</b> <b>Document</b> SUMMARY After {{completing}} {{genome sequencing}} of organism and after {{identification of the}} coding sequences virtually every protein of the organism can be assigned to its structural or coding gen, provided enough information exists about the primary structure of the protein (amino acid sequence, (e. g. tryptic) peptide masses). Unknown stays yet to which extend {{the appearance of a}} protein depends on its gen and to which extend it depends on further coding DNA-sequences. These are genes, that influence expression or modification of other proteins. In respect of these questions about regulation and modification we performed genetic mapping of polymorphic proteins in the mouse. The investigation of brain proteins of the two mouse species Mus musculus and Mus spretus with high resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis had revealed 1324 quantitative or qualitative protein polymorphisms out of a total number of 8700 cytosolic proteins (Klose 1999 b). An European Collaborative Interspecific Backcross project (EUCIB) was founded for high resolution mapping of the mouse genome, based on 1000 backcross animals from the two species Mus musculus and Mus spretus. DNA-markers were spaced 0. 61 cM on average. The mapping of 1324 protein polymorphisms on the genetic map of the mouse was based on the analysis of the polymorphisms in 64 of the 1000 backcross animals of the EUCIB cross. Because a part of the 64 backcross animals were not sufficiently genotyped with DNA-markers, we started with using additional markers based on IRS-PCR to substantially increase the marker density as a prerequisite for mapping the protein polymorphisms. This aimed at fully revealing the existing recombinations in all of the 64 backcross animals and utilizing them for the mapping of polymorphic proteins. IRS-PCR markers were used because they can be used without knowing any genomic sequence information. They are generated using a single primer, e. g. the primer B 1 R for the repetitive SINE-element B 1 of the mouse. IRS-PCR products of genomic DNA from Mus musculus revealing a quantitative polymorphism between Mus musculus and Mus spretus were used here for genotyping of up to 300 backcross animals from the EUCIB cross. The integration of 70 IRS-PCR markers and 9 microsatellite markers in the markerframework of 90 anchor markers provided by EUCIB established an improved, sound framework for positioning of the polymorphic proteins on the genetic map of the mouse. The software MAPMAKER/EXP 3. 0 was used to build a genetic map out of DNA- and protein polymorphisms. The results showed: 664 of the 1324 polymorphic protein spots could be mapped on the genetic map of the mouse. Spots showing identical inheritence and the same type of variation were given the same name and defined as a 'homogeneous spot family'. The 664 mapped spots represented therefore 409 variants. 360 variants could be placed on the mouse chromosomes. As threshold for the ordering of protein polymorphisms between DNA-markers a logarithmic odds ratio of 2. 5 was applied. 49 of the 409 variants showed only linkage to a chromosome. With the procedure used here for mapping polymorphisms based on mendelian inheritance we could only assess monogenetically caused polymorphisms. For the variants that showed linkage to a chromosome only as well as the 660 of the 1324 polymorphic spots that didn't show a mendelian segregation pattern at all, it can be concluded that the polymorphisms are caused by the effects of not only one but several genes. The polymorphisms of these spots are probably caused by additional loci other than the protein coding gene locus itself. To find out which proteins are represented by the 664 mapped spots or 409 variants mass spectrometry was used to identify the spots. The aim was, to recognize spot families and to find all the isospots that represent the same protein. Until now about 200 protein spots could be identified. Next to spots belonging to homogeneous spot families mentioned above 25 heterogeneous spot families could be recognized. A heterogeneous spot family contains spots that are all identified as the same protein, but the single spots show different types of polymorphisms. The genetic analysis showed, that some of the polymorphic spots mapped to the known position of the coding gene whereas others mapped to an unexpected chromosomal location. These mapping positions reveal probably protein-modifying or regulating genes. The identified proteins belong to several different classes: 103 protein spots represented 70 proteins which were mapped newly in the mouse. 20 proteins had already been mapped and were confirmed in our approach. These polymorphisms were considered as based on coding gene polymorphisms, where the polymorphism reflects different alleles of the gene in the two mouse species. A third class contained 21 proteins that mapped differently from the known mapping position in mouse or the human orthologue. For example, spots of the heterogeneous spot family of 'Gamma Enolase' belong to all three classes: four mobility variants map to the known position of the 'Gamma Enolase' gen on chromosome 6, two variants map to different positions on chromosome 6, one on chromosome 15 and one spot is non-variant, probably due to loss of the coding-gene-based variation during degradation of the protein. Counting single spots that are identified by mass spectrometry 70 % of the polymorphisms are based on the protein-coding gene whereas 30 % can be lead back onto modifying or regulating gene locus. In the examination presented the cytosolic fraction of mouse brain was investigated. Further investigation on the membrane fraction and on several additional mouse tissues (liver, heart, kidney and muscle) will follow. The analysis of liver and heart proteins revealed already that the majority of spots overlap with spots also present in the brain 2 D-pattern. The genetic analysis of the polymorphisms will show to which extend regulating and modificating loci are responsible for organ specificity of proteins. </body...|$|E
