40|$|Despite limited {{government}} {{control over the}} pre- 1914 economy, opposition politicians were enthusiastic in blaming bad economic news on the incumbent. In a study of 458 by-elections between 1857 and 1914, we find that voters typically gave new governments a 'honeymoon' but thereafter held them responsible for high unemployment and high prices. Each 1 % rise in the price level, on average, brought about a 0. 21 % swing against {{the government of the}} day, while each one-point rise in the percentage unemployed had double this effect. Attributing shorter- or longer-term memories to voters, as they used the past to determine what constituted <b>unacceptable</b> <b>price</b> and unemployment levels, makes little difference to this result. We also look at grievance asymmetry - the idea that voters give governments more blame for bad outcomes than they give credit for good ones - and find some evidence in its favour. voting, inflation unemplyment, Britian, elections...|$|E
40|$|High {{performance}} circuit {{techniques such}} as domino logic have migrated from the microprocessor world into more mainstream ASIC designs. The problem is that domino logic comes at a heavy cost in terms of total power dissipation. For mobile and portable devices such as laptops and cellular phones, a high power dissipation is an <b>unacceptable</b> <b>price</b> to pay for high performance. Hence, we study synthesis techniques that allow designers {{to take advantage of}} the speed of domino circuits while at the same time to minimize total power consumption. Specifically, in this paper we present three results related to automated phase assignment for the synthesis of low power domino circuits: (1) We demonstrate that the choice of phase assignment at the primary outputs of a circuit can significantly impact power dissipation in the domino block (2) We propose a method for efficiently estimating power dissipation in a domino circuit and (3) We apply the method to determine a phase assignment that minimizes power consumption in the final circuit implementation. Preliminary experimental results on a mixture of public domain benchmarks and real industry circuits show potential power savings as high as 34 % over the minimum area realization of the logic. Furthermore, the low power synthesized circuits still meet timing constraints. ...|$|E

5000|$|Another {{criticism}} of privatization, particularly {{in regard to}} municipal services such as water utilities, is that some municipalities have seen <b>unacceptable</b> increases in <b>prices</b> of services while seeing also {{a decrease in the}} quality of service and level of maintenance of the utility. For example, in Jacksonville, Florida, a company called United Water Resources owned and operated the municipal water system. After monthly bills increased in 1997 by almost $10 per month, and further requests for rate hikes later as well. The municipality's public utility, JEA, decided to buy the water system for $219 million, projecting that this would actually save customers 25% on monthly bills. [...] On the other hand, publicly managed utilities have occasionally reported trouble as well. The New York Times reported in 2004 that a consortium of citizen's groups had won a suit against the city of Los Angeles to repair 488 miles of sewer lines and conduct other maintenance.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{urban road pricing}} as a demand {{management}} policy that is often regarded as radical and generally <b>unacceptable.</b> Road <b>pricing</b> often gets delayed or abandoned due to low acceptability. This {{may be due to}} the fact that complex interactions and drivers of change affect road transport management and require cooperation within implementation networks. The implementation network is a group of people (referred to as partners and actors) who co-ordinate the introduction of policy tools. The drivers of change include any internal or external influences that have an effect on the time, place, or ‘shape’ of the policy measures being introduced. Demand management measures that focus on 'sustainable transport' usually address a limited set of objectives and are often implemented alone i. e. are not necessarily combined with other policy measures. When combined with other measures, it is not always clear whether the multiple interactions between policy tools and implementation networks have been sufficiently considered. Examples of ongoing implementation of policy package in the UK are the support of road pricing initiatives combined with public transport improvements by the Transport Innovation Fund. The objectives of the paper are twofold. First, we present a review of the UK urban road pricing situation. Second, we contrast the emerging issues against six key implementation factors. The analysis of three existing UK road pricing examples - London, Edinburgh and Durham – shows the importance of combining policy tools. Furthermore, through the above examples and theoretical arguments, we emphasise the additional need of creating and maintaining strong networks when implementing policy packages...|$|R
40|$|Transfer pricing is an {{important}} business tool in the modern world. In the modern era of globalisation, it provides management {{with the opportunity to}} manipulate prices, pursuing the business objective of maximisation of profits. This in turn allows for increased distribution to the shareholders. From a profit maximisation perspective, this concept is certainly tenable. However, businesses need to pay due consideration to the taxation implications of transfer pricing. While allowing for effective repatriation of profits from a high or low tax jurisdiction to a low or no tax jurisdiction, businesses need to be duly consider the taxation consequences if the revenue authorities establish that the tax base of their country is being depleted by such repatriations. In certain jurisdictions, the statutory powers allows for reconstruction with the existence of a mere suspicion of <b>unacceptable</b> <b>price</b> manipulation. Unlike New Zealand, the statutory framework imposes onerous obligations on the Commissioner to challenge the transfer prices by establishing that the adopted transfer pricing method is not comparable to arms length transactions. Largely, transfer pricing involves a degree of price manipulation between a parent and a subsidiary. Against this background, multi-nationals need to balance this against the social obligations of the citizens of the country. The central issue behind almost all transfer pricing disputes between multinationals and revenue authorities is whether the prices charged is consistent with that of independent and un-associated parties. In saying this, it has to be recognised that certain transactions may have little to no comparable transactions, which constraints the search to substantiate the basis for the pricing. To make this concept workable, the transfer pricing rules in most jurisdictions operate on the basis of treating the parent and the subsidiary as separate entities. While this concept is theoretically sound, practically {{it is very difficult to}} “artificially” make the distinction for cross border transactions. Against this practical constraint, multinationals and revenue authorities reliance on commercial databases to corroborate the transfer prices certainly poses more questions. Effectively, the requirement to keep the transfer prices at arms length is discharged through utilisation of a database, designed for purposes other than transfer pricing...|$|E
40|$|In 1994 FOURIE AND SMITH ANALYSED {{the cement}} market in South Africa on a structural, conduct and {{performance}} basis {{and came to}} the conclusion, inter alia, that cement price trends and cement price levels were unacceptably high. They accused cement manufacturers of abusing their market power by setting prices above marginal cost, with the resultant misallocation of resources. They acknowledged that {{due to a lack of}} in-depth information regarding industry, firms and plant data, "it is not possible to determine to what extent these higher price increases were the result of the cartel members abusing their market power and/or various cost factors peculiar to the cement industry" (1994 : 134). They therefore foresaw the possibility of costs peculiar to the cement industry that could have had a contributing effect on <b>unacceptable</b> cement <b>price</b> trends and the unacceptably high price levels of cement. Research by De Wet in 1987 regarding the cement market under price control was made available in 2001 after a 15 -year embargo by the Cement Manufacturers' Association. In his research some cost factors peculiar to the cement industry during the late 1970 s and early 1980 s were identified. These costs include depreciation as a fixed cost and railage as a variable cost. The purpose of this paper is to analyse in more detail the depreciation and railage costs identified by De Wet as peculiar to the cement industry. The impact of depreciation as a fixed cost and railage as a variable cost on the cement price trends and on cement price levels will therefore be the focal point of this research. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{is already}} a large {{component}} of our economy and society. Historically, transport programmes were substantially about developing basic infrastructure networks. Now {{the emphasis is on}} the active management of systems and operating them to maximum advantage in the face of growing travel demand and capacity limitations. Combined developments in technology and the world economy have accelerated change to almost unpredictable levels. The change affects many areas and transport is not an exception. With new vehicle technologies, radical policies and the persistent growth in private and commercial vehicles, a new changing transport landscape is emerging. One of these changes {{comes in the form of}} sustainable transport management - managing the demand of existing infrastructure networks. The role of demand management has been illustrated in many reports and papers and it seems that governments are becoming more aware of it. This paper focuses on one particular demand management policy that is often regarded as radical and generally <b>unacceptable.</b> Road <b>pricing</b> often gets delayed or abandoned due to controversy, disagreements, unanticipated problems and a whole host of other delaying factors. There are complex interactions in transport management - there is a need for cooperation between networks, stakeholders and different authorities. Single measures that focus on 'sustainable transport' usually address a limited set of objectives and are not usually combined with other policy measures. When combined, it is sometimes unclear whether the multiple interactions between policy tools and implementation networks have been considered. An emerging case of implementation of a policy package in the UK is the support of road pricing initiatives combined with public transport improvements by the Transport Innovation Fund.

40|$|When {{the public}} decides that {{a product or}} {{production}} process is socially <b>unacceptable,</b> the share <b>price</b> of the firms involved may suffer. The danger is that, out of distaste, people will refrain from buying the product or the shares. But being able to assess the degree of unacceptability can mean being better able to assess how it will affect a firm’s profitability, and being better able to assess {{the value of a}} firm. Over the past twenty-five years, many psychological studies have considered predictors of unacceptability for one class of industrial activities: those perceived as producing risks to health, safety, and the environment. We compare results from several studies of risk perception conducted from 1975 – 1994 with current consumer boycotts and the screening criteria of socially responsible investment firms—two forms of organized distaste. From both perspectives, high historic ratings on undesirable risk characteristics have predicted current organized aversion. These relationships are discussed in terms of how to make more precise estimates of the direct and indirect effects of social unacceptability on share price. One way is to pay critical attention to the financial disclosures of firms that may have such problems in light of the concurrent state of scientific knowledge. We illustrate these issues with the case of genetically modified organisms...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays. I investigate information dynamics under different settings. In Chapter 1, I consider a market with a profit-maximizing monopolist seller who has K identical goods to sell before a deadline. At each date, the seller posts a price and the quantity available but cannot commit to future offers. Over time, potential buyers with different reservation values enter the market. Buyers can strategically time their purchases, trading off (1) a possibly lower price in the future with {{the risk of being}} rationed and (2) the current price without competition. I analyze equilibrium price paths and buyers 2 ̆ 7 purchase behavior. I show that incentive compatible price paths decline smoothly over the time period between sales and jump up immediately after a transaction. In equilibrium, high value buyers purchase immediately on arrival. Crucially, before the deadline, the seller may periodically liquidate part of his stock via a fire sale to secure a higher price in the future. Intuitively, these sales allow the seller to `commit 2 ̆ 7 to high prices going forward. The possibility of fire sales before the deadline implies that the allocation may be inefficient. The inefficiency arises from the scarce good being misallocated to low value buyers, rather than the withholding inefficiency that is normally seen with a monopolist seller. In chapter 2, I study dynamic bargaining with uncertainty over the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s valuation and the seller 2 ̆ 7 s outside option. A long-lived seller makes offers to a long-lived buyer whose value is private information. There may exist a short-lived buyer, whose value is higher than that of the long-lived buyer. The arrival of a short-lived buyer, if she exists, is determined by a Poisson process. I characterize the unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium. The equilibrium displays price fluctuations: in some periods, the seller charges a high <b>price</b> <b>unacceptable</b> to the long-lived buyer, {{in the hope that the}} short-lived buyer appears in that period; in the other periods, he offers a price attractive to some values of the long-lived buyer. The price dynamics result from the interaction between two learning processes: exogenous learning about the existence of short-lived buyers, and endogenous learning about the long-lived buyer 2 ̆ 7 s value. In chapter 3, I study the dynamics of workers 2 ̆ 7 on-the-job search behavior and its consequences in an equilibrium labor market. In a model with both directed search and learning about the match quality of firm-worker pairs, I highlight the job search target effect of learning: as a worker updates the evaluation of his current job, he adjusts his on-the-job search target, which results in a different job finding rate. I show that this model generates a non-monotonic relation between the employment-to-employment transition rate and tenure, which provides a new explanation of the hump-shaped separation rate-tenure profile. ...|$|R
