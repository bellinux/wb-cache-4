At the junction of the two streets is a semicircular portico, with fluted monolithic Corinthian columns carrying a recessed circular tower. Around the tower is a band of small circular windows, and on the top is a shallow dome. Along {{the sides of the}} church are Corinthian unfluted pilasters, between which are two tiers of windows; the windows in the <b>upper</b> storeys have <b>round</b> <b>heads,</b> and those below have square heads. The only remaining internal feature from the original design is the double staircase with iron balusters under the dome. The interior of the dome is coffered. Outside the building are ornamental iron railings.|$|R

The main eastern facade and entrance to the building is from within the Showgrounds. This is a two-storey section which has food shops at ground level and offices and meeting rooms on the first floor level. The two principal entrances to the building are openings large enough to accommodate trucks and other vehicles. The entrances are emphasised by stylised columns, capitals and entablatures with balconies above. Sets of three French doors open onto the balconies. The food shops have metal security doors that open upwards. The first floor level is delineated on the facade by a rendered stringcourse. All the windows on the <b>upper</b> level have <b>round</b> <b>headed</b> windows containing steel framed eight pane casements. The panels below the windows contain a decorative pattern of brickwork. The building has been extended to the northwest and this extension is distinguished on the facade by mottled patterned brickwork, simplified detailing, large multi-paned window and corrugated metal sun shading.|$|R
