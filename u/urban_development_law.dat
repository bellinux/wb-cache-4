5000|$|Although the Rajapaksas had {{dominated}} {{politics in}} Hambantota District since 1936, national politics had {{been dominated by}} other families such as Senanayakes and Bandaranaikes. This changed in 2005 when Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected president. Since then {{members of the family}} have been appointed to senior political positions. Immediately after being elected president Mahinda appointed his brother Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as Defence Secretary (the most senior civil service position in the Ministry of Defence). Another brother, Basil Rajapaksa, was appointed Senior Presidential Advisor. In 2010 Mahinda Rajapaksa was re-elected President contesting against a grand opposition coalition that included UNP, TNA, JVP. At the 2010 Parliamentary Elections, Chamal Rajapaksa, Basil Rajapaksa and Namal Rajapaksa were elected. Basil Rajapaksa received 425,100 preferential votes from the Gampaha District, the highest by any candidate at the 2010 General election while Namal Rajapaksa obtained 147,568 preferential votes from Hambantota District, the highest majority percentage-wise at the election. Subsequently, Chamal was elected as the Speaker of Parliament unanimously and Basil was appointed as the Minister of Economic Development. Between them the three Rajapaksa brothers are in charge of five government ministries: Defence & <b>Urban</b> <b>Development,</b> <b>Law</b> & Order, Economic Development, Finance & Planning and Ports & Highways. At one point the brothers reportedly directly controlled 70% of the national budget. [...] The Rajapaksas denied having control over such amounts. According to the 2014 budget the brothers have been allocated 47% of the national budget (40% of recurrent budget and 57% of capital budget).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the situation of}} urban renewal policies during Qajar, Pahlavi and the Islamic Republic in the contemporary Iran, based {{on the process of}} legislation of civic organizations, urban legislative bodies and other related organizations. With an emphasis on socio-cultural and political factors, it examines the process of urban renewal policies. During the late Qajar strategic political and economical relationships between Iran and European countries, as well as military conflicts with British and Russia, encouraged the Iranian government to re-organize its administration in response to local and international issues (for example, the development of the Ministry of Interior from Department of Inspection). The Constitutional Revolution and establishment of the first parliament on 0 I / 0311286 AH-June 1907 AD paved the way for civilian rule in urban areas and the introduction of effective civic organizations. Establishment of city councils and municipalities across the country are both the direct result of parliamentary approval of Baladiyah Constitution, which marked new era of urban development. After World War I and during the urban renewal movement in Europe, the controversial Law of Development of Urban Corridors was approved to develop organic urban areas into modem cities, which in this research is considered as the major urban renewal policy and programme during the First Phase of Urban Renewal Policies and Programmes. During World War II the infrastructure and urban areas of the country were severely damaged. Thus, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) financially and technically supported the government to overcome post war difficulties, which led to Iran's Development Programmes to organize reconstruction efforts and urban planning with the help of foreign organizations such as American International Council of Development. Iran's Third Development Programme demanded effective and uniform urban planning, therefore the Urban Planning Organization was introduced, responsible for the planning and improvement of urban areas. 22 / 12 / 1342 All-March 1963 AD announced a major development breakthrough with the introduction of the Ministry of Development and Housing, also approval of the Constitution of <b>Urban</b> <b>Development,</b> <b>Law</b> of Urban Renewal and Civil Improvement and other major urban regulations sped up the Second Phase of Urban Renewal Policies and Programmes. This phase ended with Barn's earthquake on 26112 / 2003 AD. The consequences of this natural disaster enforced the government to elevate urban renewal policies and programmes to national level to prevent another human catastrophe: this is better known as Urban Renewal Movement, which in this research is considered as the Third Phase of Urban Renewal Policies and Programmes. Following the Islamic Revolution and screening of governmental employees and academics, large numbers of senior and experience staff were forced to leave their posts. In this way, universities have been shut down and large numbers of young revolutionary forces without appropriate education or experience have come to occupy key positions. The urban problems sketched out here deepened during twenty-one years of Iran-Iraq war and ceasefire (1980 - 200 I AD) coupled with the employment of lifetime office holders with militarily or religious background in the foremost organizations. Constant cycles of establishment and dissolution, change or modification to constitutions, laws, regulations, chairs of the Ministries and civic organizations, and consequently the lack of urban development policy, are the main characteristics of this era. This period is responsible {{for the development of a}} gap which divided the process of urban renewal policies into two major eras; Pahlavi (relatively unknown) and Islamic Republic (relatively chaotic). Two of the main factors that motivate this research are my academic experience and involvement with civic organizations. There has been a significant lack of work that offers concrete materials to scholars, researchers, authorities and students to allow them to appreciate the socio-historical factors behind 	 legislative bodies, and assist them in understanding urban renewal policies and programmes within a political framework. This research sets out to examine the greatest danger yet faced by Persian cities; bulldozer philosophy (Appendix H - Glossary). To describe the depth of the crisis, large amounts of information have been carefully collected and various issues such as the role of master-planning on regeneration programmes and the quality of executive programmes have been examined. The thesis approaches these various issues by analysing the legislation behind the establishment of the urban decision-making bodies, civic and executive organizations (Appendix H - Glossary), and role of provincial associations. Tracking the development of legislation alongside the analysis of socio-cultural and political events was central to the research process. This approach provided the latitude to cover all relevant aspects of planning and administration. Moreover, it provides a clear logic for the organisation of this thesis, and for others to develop further research with confidence. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{question}} whether {{and to what extent}} <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics make use of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts to tackle tasks and challenges posed by immigration and the presence of migrants in cities. As a start, relevant migration-related issues with a connection to <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> are expounded. This is followed by the analysis of six <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts in terms of any migration and integration – related statements they may contain. The thesis consists of three chapters: in the first chapter, “migration” as the given central topic is identified and discussed following an examination of up-to-date specialist literature. There is a strong emphasis on the terminology used in current debates with particular attention given to the term “integration“. Another aspect of the first chapter is immigration in Germany: since its foundation, the Federal Republic of Germany has been a destination for immigrants; as a result, there are presently 12 million people from migrant backgrounds living in Germany. Among the main destinations were large West German cities, and within these cities specific districts which have consequently become rife with migration-related issues and problems. As a result, there are complex social, economic and spatial developments and phenomena which all have an impact on <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics: Population development, segregation, the housing situation, the educational situation, their economic potential and chances, cultural impact of the presence of migrants. These aspects and the subject of integration and their relevance to <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> are the main topics of the professional debate. “Migration” with its complex spatial and content-related implications thus offers a cross- section view of <b>urban</b> <b>development.</b> The second chapter addresses the subject of “urban development”. A brief retrospective highlights the general framework and paradigms of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> since the 1960 s and, above all, the use and implementation of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. The realisation here is that <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts do provide ideas and possibilities on how to handle migration-related issues and integrate these into <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics. Basic consideration of urban migration topics on one hand and <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics on the other hand have been the basis for developing a “migration evaluation” of selected current <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. Using a uniform investigation raster, it is explored how and to what extent these <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts contain statements on the migration-related topics mentioned above. The concluding examination in the third chapter returns to the initial questions: Is migration an integral part of current <b>urban</b> <b>development?</b> If so, how and to what extent? This will then lead to questions of whether the full potential of migration-related possibilities is being tapped and the restrictions and boundaries that apply. The overall conclusion is that <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics has so far failed to fully realise the importance of “migration” as an issue. <b>Urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts have been used with reserve to implement this issue in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics in an explicit, constructive and stringent manner. There {{can be no doubt that}} this is a difficult task. The appropriate consideration of issues of migration and integration in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts is met with various challenges: the complexity of this task cannot be ignored. However, this should by no means affect the comprehensibility of the problem; the significance of migration issues within <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts and the real life impact of these issues on <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> should correspond; <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts should be closely linked with other (professional) conceptions in the context of migration and integration. Migrants should be involved in the process of creating <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts in order to tap their resources, knowledge and potential for <b>urban</b> <b>development.</b> Finally, the thesis identifies existing gaps and areas in need of further research: <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts give but little indication of actual activity in the respective migration-related communal arenas; also, <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts are the result and expression of ongoing local politics debates, yet a discrepancy remains between the political aims and stances identified in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts and those discussed outside the realm of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. This discrepancy requires further analysis. A third gap has been identified between local politics objectives and actual local activity beyond political agendas. The thesis closes on the note that not only is there a need for migration to be recognised as an urban development-relevant matter but that there is ample reasoning for the integration of migration as a task in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics...|$|R
