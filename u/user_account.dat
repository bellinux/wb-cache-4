5|$|Other {{features}} include Bloodhound technology, which looks for virus-like behavior to better find zero day viruses. The Security Inspector looks for common vulnerabilities, including insecure <b>user</b> <b>account</b> passwords and browser insecurities. Advertisement blocking rewrites a website's HTML to prevent advertisements from being displayed. Parental controls, an optional component, can block certain programs from accessing the Internet, such as IM clients, and restrict newsgroup access. Restrictions {{can be assigned}} to different Windows users accounts. Sites are classified in 31 categories, and the four profiles which can be assigned each block different categories of sites. Supervisors define exceptions, add global blocked sites, or block all access to sites not on a user-created whitelist. Both PC Magazine and PC Pro noted the exclusion of time-based restrictions. Information filtering can be controlled on a per-user basis.|$|E
5|$|Digital: A Love Story is {{a visual}} novel, or {{interactive}} fiction game, where the game's {{story is told}} primarily through text. The game is presented {{as if on a}} computer from the late 1980s running the Amie operating system (the name and visual appearance a reference to 1.x versions of AmigaOS). The player logs into bulletin board systems, or BBSs, where they read and reply to messages from other people. Messages received from other characters in the game are displayed through a different program on the computer screen. Accessing a BBS requires the knowledge of the telephone number for that board, which the player must type in manually. Boards that require a long-distance telephone number to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long-distance calling card numbers found online. Accessing boards also requires the player to either set up a <b>user</b> <b>account</b> for that board or to know the password necessary to enter the system.|$|E

25|$|Protected Mode (available in Windows Vista only), {{whereby the}} browser {{runs in a}} sandbox with even lower rights than a limited <b>user</b> <b>account.</b> As such, it can only write to the Temporary Internet Files folder and cannot install {{start-up}} programs or change any configuration of the operating system without communicating through a broker process.

50|$|Unlike At Ease, {{which allowed}} {{multiple}} password protected <b>user</b> <b>accounts,</b> Navigator only allowed password protection {{on each of}} the sections (only one password).

50|$|The user {{management}} service handles {{the creation and}} management of <b>user</b> <b>accounts</b> {{as well as the}} authentication and authorization of <b>user</b> <b>accounts</b> and <b>user</b> access respectively.

25|$|However, the {{cryptography}} keys for EFS are {{in practice}} {{protected by the}} <b>user</b> <b>account</b> password, and are therefore susceptible to most password attacks. In other words, the encryption of a file is only {{as strong as the}} password to unlock the decryption key.|$|E

25|$|Since Windows Vista is, by default, a {{computer}} administrator that runs everything under limited user privileges, when a program requires administrative privileges, a <b>User</b> <b>Account</b> Control pop-up will prompt {{the user to}} allow or deny the action. This improves on the design used by previous versions of Windows.|$|E

It determines whether an object or resource can be accessed, via the use of access control lists (ACLs), which are themselves made up of access control entries (ACEs).
