As a school graduate, Blair had unsuccessfully auditioned for another role in the serial, but impressed casting director Jan Russ. Six months later, Russ contacted Blair and asked her to audition for the role of Carmella. She was cast immediately, due to the <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> fill the void left by Goodrem. She played Carmella on an episodic basis in 2003, then returned for a longer period in 2004, and briefly in 2005.

Mr. Burns is undeterred by the strike and tries several methods of breaking it up, but fails. On an edition of Kent Brockman's talk show Smartline, Mr. Burns is allowed an opening tirade and he threatens dire events if the strike is not concluded.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebee {{species are}} declining in Europe, North America, and Asia {{due to a}} number of factors, {{including}} land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus. A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the Bombus genus. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species Bombus hortorum in particular {{has been found to be}} impacted by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size.|$|E
