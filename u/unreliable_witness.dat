5|$|After {{completing}} Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci {{suggested to}} Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign, a new gold coin equal to one pound {{that was to}} be struck, would be Saint George. Until the early 20th century, gold coins were struck for circulation, rather than as bullion pieces. Kevin Clancy, in his volume {{on the history of the}} sovereign coin, doubted whether the Spencer commission was truly the inspiration for the George and Dragon design which that coin has long featured, and that the idea might not even have come from Pistrucci. Clancy argued that such motifs were common at the time and that the story originated with Pistrucci, whom he deemed an <b>unreliable</b> <b>witness</b> on his own past.|$|E
25|$|By law in 1946, Peggy {{could not}} be made to testify against her husband, and, because she was {{considered}} as an <b>unreliable</b> <b>witness,</b> Youell was not arrested for murder.

25|$|Briony's apologies are not accepted. Robbie, enraged at her presence, nearly hurts her, but Cecilia calms him down, and {{the couple}} instead demands that Briony confess her lie in writing and have the legal records rectified. Briony {{promises}} to do so. When she tells them the real assailant was Paul {{and that he was}} just married to Lola, Cecilia is disappointed: Paul is now unlikely to be punished, being immune to Lola's testimony as his wife, and with Briony's having become an <b>unreliable</b> <b>witness.</b>|$|E

2500|$|On 31 August 2012, the High Court {{dismissed}} the lawsuit. The High Court judge stated {{that because of}} the nature of the evidence, the case hinged on whether to believe Berezovsky or Abramovich's evidence. The judge found Berezovsky to be [...] "an unimpressive, and inherently <b>unreliable</b> <b>witness,</b> who regarded truth as a transitory, flexible concept, which could be moulded to suit his current purposes", whereas Abramovich was seen as [...] "a truthful, and on the whole, reliable witness".|$|E

Dunn and Alister stated that they intended only to write graffiti at Cameron's home and had no knowledge of the bomb, which they claimed had been brought by Seary. Seary was considered by some to be an <b>unreliable</b> <b>witness,</b> having already given discredited evidence accusing Dunn and Alistair at the initial Hilton bombing inquest, being a drug addict and a [...] "mentally disturbed fantasizer".|$|E

2500|$|The first {{criticism}} of Filbinger's war time record {{dates back to}} 10 April 1972. Two weeks before the Baden-Württemberg state elections, the Der Spiegel magazine published one of Filbinger's verdicts. On 29 May 1945, Filbinger presided at the trial against artillery man Petzold and sentenced him to six months imprisonment for incitement of discontent, refusal of obedience and resistance. In an editorial, the Spiegel also claimed that, based on Petzold's memories, Filbinger had referred to Hitler as [...] "our beloved Führer ... who has brought the fatherland back up". Filbinger immediately reacted by filing {{a lawsuit against the}} Spiegel, demanding that the Spiegel desist from making such a claim. The court decided in favour of Filbinger, since it found Petzold an <b>unreliable</b> <b>witness</b> and the alleged quote in conflict with Filbinger's other utterances and actions.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2015, police {{reputation}} {{suffered a}} further blow {{when a student}} accused by a police officer of attacking him during the clearance of the Mong Kok occupation on 28 November 2014 was acquitted. In three written statements and during questioning at the witness stand, Constable Lau Kam-wing accused the defendant of approaching him from the front and hitting him in the mouth. Video evidence submitted by an independent witness clearly showed that Lau was in a highly agitated state, and that the defendant was behind him and had not assaulted Lau. Lau changed his testimony under questioning, and again {{in light of the}} video evidence. The judge observed that the case was [...] "highly suspicious" [...] and that the defendant had been falsely accused; he criticised Lau's wavering testimony and reproached him for being a dishonest and thus <b>unreliable</b> <b>witness.</b> The judge ordered the incident to be referred to the police complaints department, and asked to be kept informed of the progress of the investigation.|$|E

3000|$|Michael Huemer concludes, that “… {{it would}} be {{unlikely}} that <b>unreliable</b> <b>witnesses</b> would agree, says the coherentist; therefore, the agreement of the witnesses is reason to think their reports true” [19, p. 338]. But {{there are a lot}} of problems within coherentism, e.g., considerations of probability towards the <b>unreliable</b> <b>witnesses</b> and their coherent answers, which are not a big problem for weak coheretism but for a strong coherentism [18, 19]. Nevertheless, concerning an epistemological theory of futures studies, it is not easy to work with a coherentist approach. It is not plausible that one single belief or a bunch of beliefs could justify one’s beliefs about the future if they were all equally in need of justification. Therefore, no belief is stable enough to justify any belief or a system of beliefs about the future. 6 [...]...|$|R
