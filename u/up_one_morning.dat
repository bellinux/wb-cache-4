5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam woke <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe {{promoting}} their film Stargate. A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like Stargate {{if he did not}} believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to {{imagine what it would be}} like to wake <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities.

It implied that she cared for him because he was weak, and he drew a very long face.|$|R
500|$|Vanderbilt {{was drawn}} to the notion that Graysmith went from a {{cartoonist}} {{to one of the most}} significant investigators of the case. He pitched the story as: [...] "What if Garry Trudeau woke <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> and tried to solve the Son of Sam"? As he worked on the script, he became friends with Graysmith. The filmmakers were able to get the cooperation of the Vallejo Police Department (one of the key investigators at the time) because they hoped that the film would inspire someone to come forward with a crucial bit of information that might help solve this decades-old cold case.|$|E
500|$|During {{the editing}} phase, Singer {{thought that they}} had {{completed}} the film two weeks early, but woke <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> and realized that they needed that time {{to put together a}} sequence that convinced the audience that Dean Keaton was Söze — and then do the same for Verbal Kint because the film did not have [...] "the punch that Chris had written so beautifully." [...] According to Ottman, he assembled the footage as a montage but it still did not work until he added an overlapping voice-over montage featuring key dialogue from several characters and had it relate to the images. Early on, executives at Gramercy had problems pronouncing the name Keyser Söze and were worried that audiences would have the same problem. The studio decided to promote the character's name. Two weeks before the film debuted in theaters, [...] "Who is Keyser Söze?" [...] posters appeared at bus stops, and TV spots told people how to say the character's name. [...] Despite these efforts, all the actors in the film consistently mispronounce his name as [...] "Soze" [...] instead of [...] "Söze".|$|E
500|$|In March 2013, {{a two-part}} hip hop track {{entitled}} [...] "Bow Down/I Been On" [...] was released onto Beyoncé's Soundcloud account. [...] "Bow Down", produced by Hit-Boy, was written after Beyoncé woke <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> with a chant stuck in her head, feeling angry and defensive. This was melded with a Timbaland-produced second half, [...] "I Been On", that makes prominent {{use of a}} pitch-distorted vocal as a homage to the Houston hip hop scene. Michael Cragg of The Guardian described the song as [...] "brilliantly odd", commending its loud, abrasive production, while Pitchforks Lindsay Zoladz noted the song's assertiveness and believed it served as an introduction {{of what was to}} come. [...] "Bow Down/I Been On" [...] was perceived as a significant departure from Beyoncé's existing catalogue, particularly for its aggressive nature. The song's atmosphere and its controversial [...] "Bow down, bitches" [...] refrain drew a mixed reaction from those who questioned whether the lyric was aimed at women or merely a moment of braggadocio. Beyoncé clarified after the album's release, where elements of [...] "Bow Down" [...] appear on the track [...] "Flawless", that the song and its refrain were intended as a statement of female empowerment.|$|E

500|$|Science fiction Grand Masters, Sir Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl collaborated for {{the first}} time on The Last Theorem. The novel {{initially}} was Clarke's, and he began working on it in early 2004. But in 2006, at the age of 88, ill health brought on by complications from post-polio syndrome, and writer's block, impeded his progress, and he asked Pohl for help. Pohl explained: [...] "Arthur said to me that he woke <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> and didn't know how to write any of the books he had contracted. The stories had just gone out of his head." [...] Clarke gave Pohl a 40–50 page manuscript plus roughly 50 pages of notes, and over the next two years, Pohl wrote the book. Pohl said that [...] "Everything in the novel is something he either suggested or wrote or I discussed with him." [...] Some of Clarke's notes were so obscure that even Clarke himself could not understand them. Pohl, only two years younger than Clarke, had health problems of his own: he could no longer type and wrote the book out in longhand, leaving it up to his wife to translate his [...] "indecipherable scribbles". Clarke reviewed and approved the final manuscript of The Last Theorem in early March 2008, just days before he died. Pohl died five years later in September 2013.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inverted}} spectrum thought experiment, {{originally developed}} by John Locke, {{invites us to}} imagine that we wake <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> and find that {{for some unknown reason}} all the colors in the world have been inverted. Furthermore, we discover that no physical changes have occurred in our brains or bodies that would explain this phenomenon. Supporters of the existence of qualia argue that since we can imagine this happening without contradiction, it follows that we are imagining a change in a property that determines the way things look to us, but that has no physical basis.

2500|$|Adams {{described}} himself as a [...] "radical atheist", adding [...] "radical" [...] for emphasis so he would not be asked if he meant agnostic. He told American Atheists that this conveyed the fact that he really meant it.

In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!" [...] to demonstrate his view that the fine-tuned Universe argument for God was a fallacy.|$|E

Huey, Dewey and Louie wake <b>up</b> <b>one</b> Christmas <b>morning</b> {{and open}} their presents, {{even though they}} are {{supposed}} to wait first for Aunt Daisy, Uncle Scrooge and Aunt Gertie to arrive. After the boys take their new sleds from their Uncle Donald (not reading the included gift card) they go sledding and have Christmas dinner in which Donald yells at them to learn their manners. While Donald, Daisy, Uncle Scrooge and Aunt Gertie sing carols, the boys play with their new toys.|$|R
2500|$|... {{imagine a}} puddle waking <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> and thinking, 'This is an {{interesting}} world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must {{have been made to}} have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.|$|E
2500|$|Before the 1984 season got underway, Boros' notoriety {{from his}} use of a {{computer}} became a distraction {{in the eyes of}} team management and baseball traditionalists. Longtime friend Phil Regan recalled, [...] "He received some criticism for using computers in the mid-1980s and now everyone in the game uses computers." [...] In their book on baseball's fascination with statistics, Alan Schwartz and Peter Gammons wrote:"Baseball's conservatives howled in horror. As 1984 neared, you'd think that George Orwell was in the press box: Almost every article on baseball and computers used a silly, futuristic lead, with machines replacing managers and robots turning double plays[...] [...] [...] Steve Boros woke <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> as the standard bearer of baseball's on-field information revolution.

He is an executive at A.T. & Love, a company that also makes many appearances in unrelated sketches. In one sketch, his armpit odor becomes a best-selling, world-changing product. In another, he wakes <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> and reads the newspaper, which states he has been kidnapped, after which he desperately gathers money to pay his own ransom. In yet another, Danny is summoned to the office of his boss, who needs to be consoled upon discovering [...] "brown stuff" [...] oozing from his mouth. Husk is successful in his consolation when he tells his boss that there is [...] "no need to see a doctor" [...] since the substance is odorless, and therefore, not [...] "poo-based". Another appearance has Danny's boss discover that he used to be a porn star by the name of Blade Rogers. In many of his appearances, Husk serves as a straight man to the wacky antics of one of the others. Dave Foley had a recurring role as Husk's rotund boss. Danny Husk ended up appearing in approximately a dozen sketches through seasons 1, 3, 4 and 5. Additionally, a variation of Husk, named Wally Terzinsky, appeared in the Kids' 1996 movie Brain Candy.|$|E
