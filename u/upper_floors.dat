5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the upper and lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to the <b>upper</b> <b>floors,</b> holding the records, was removed, and a window on the first floor was turned into a doorway so that the <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E

His granddaughter Susan Morrow would manage the Princess from 1981 to 1994.|$|E
40|$|This thesis has {{evaluated}} if {{housing is}} a feasible alternative for vacant <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> {{space in the}} central business district of small towns in general and in downtown Burlington, Iowa, specifically. The study required discussing the issue of housing in vacant <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> spaces in general, establishing {{if there was a}} need for additional multi-use housing in the Burlington, Iowa housing market, and finally determining if there was vacant <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> space that would fulfill this need. The analysis determined that housing was indeed a feasible and practical use for vacant <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> space in downtown areas in general and in Burlington, Iowa specifically. The study provided a method {{that could be used to}} ascertain the feasibility of this type of housing in other towns as well. Department of Urban PlanningThesis (M. U. R. P. ...|$|R

5|$|Montacute, {{like many}} Elizabethan mansions, is built in an 'E' shape, a much-used plan in this era.

Over the centuries, the layout and use of rooms changed: drawing and dining rooms evolved on the ground floor.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to {{what many}} outsiders believed, most {{residents}} of the Walled City behaved similarly to other Hong Kong natives. In response to difficult living conditions, the residents formed a tightly knit community, helping one another endure various hardships. Within families, wives often did housekeeping, while grandmothers cared for their grandchildren and other children from surrounding households. The City's rooftops were an important gathering place, especially for residents who lived on <b>upper</b> <b>floors.</b> Parents used them to relax, and children would play or do homework there after school.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{this design}} would prove too {{advanced}} and expensive for Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate {{design of the}} Reynolds Building, {{which was published in}} August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.|$|E
