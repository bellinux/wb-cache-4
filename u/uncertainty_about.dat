5|$|The {{problems}} amongst John's wider family {{continued to}} grow. His elder brother Geoffrey died during a tournament in 1186, leaving a posthumous son, Arthur, and an elder daughter, Eleanor.

40|$|This paper quantifies some of {{the general}} {{equilibrium}} costs of inflation for the UK using a shopping-time model. It tests whether money balances tend to a finite number as nominal interest rates tend to zero, and explores how <b>uncertainties</b> <b>about</b> {{the shape of the}} money demand curve translate into <b>uncertainties</b> <b>about</b> these welfare costs of inflation. A key uncertainty is the existence of a satiation point for money balances. We show that without observations at nominal interest rates close to zero, the power of satiation tests can be low. ...|$|R

Die Zauberflote was started earlier and put aside for the Tito commission, which was completed and performed first and is usually listed as the earlier work despite having a higher Köchel catalogue number.|$|E

5|$|Since its premiere, 2001: A Space Odyssey {{has been}} {{analyzed}} and interpreted by professional film critics, amateur writers and science fiction fans, {{virtually all of}} whom have mentioned its deliberate ambiguity. Questions about 2001 range from <b>uncertainty</b> <b>about</b> its deeper philosophical implications about humanity's origins and final destiny in the universe, to interpreting elements of the film's more enigmatic scenes such as the meaning of the monolith, or the final fate of astronaut David Bowman. There are also simpler and more mundane questions about what drives the plot, in particular the causes of Hal's breakdown (explained in earlier drafts but kept mysterious in the film).|$|E
5|$|Since {{the day of}} the accident, {{there was}} <b>{{uncertainty}}</b> <b>about</b> who boarded the plane and about the exact cargo manifest—all leading to uncertainty as to the identity of the bodies recovered from the crash site; some bodies, including that of Sikorski's daughter, Zofia, were never recovered. Since several bodies were never found and the bodies of several members of Sikorski's entourage were never positively identified, some conspiracy theorists such as journalist and amateur historian Dariusz Baliszewski postulate that some might have been murdered on the ground while others might have been abducted to the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|There is {{considerable}} <b>uncertainty</b> <b>about</b> {{the identities of}} the Grand Dukes of Lithuania between Traidenis' death in 1282 and Vytenis' assumption of power in 1295. This is in part because the two main sources for Lithuanian history in the 13th century, the Hypatian Codex and the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, end in the early 1290s. In 1285, one chronicle mentions Daumantas as Grand Duke. He attacked the Bishop of Tver and was severely wounded or even killed in the battle. However, that is the only information about him.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} <b>uncertainty</b> <b>about</b> which forms of psychosocial and physical treatments {{of people who}} harm themselves are most effective.

Many people who self-harm have moderate or severe depression and therefore treatment with antidepressant medications may often be used. There is tentative evidence for the medication flupentixol; however, greater study is required before it can be recommended.|$|E

His birthplace was 39 John Street, Abercwmboi (then known as Cap Coch) in the South Wales coalfields, the fourth child of Thomas Davies and his wife Esther. Thomas was a miner and trade union activist, who under the {{pseudonym}} Y Llwynog ("the Fox") wrote a column for the Welsh language newspaper Tarian y Gweithiwr ("The Worker's Shield"), in which he berated pit management and safety practices. His general militancy led to his blacklisting by pit owners, and after spells of unemployment he eventually found work as an insurance agent.|$|E

5|$|Along with {{questions}} {{over the new}} ships' nomenclature came <b>uncertainty</b> <b>about</b> their actual role due to their lack of protection.

If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, they were too thin-skinned to be safe from an enemy's heavy guns. The Invincibles were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, the viability of the armoured cruiser was already in doubt. A cruiser that could have worked with the Fleet might have been a more viable option for taking over that role.|$|E
