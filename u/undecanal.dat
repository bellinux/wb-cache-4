50|$|<b>Undecanal,</b> {{also known}} as undecyl aldehyde, is an organic {{compound}} with the chemical formula C10H21CHO. It is an eleven-carbon aldehyde. A colourless, oily liquid, <b>undecanal</b> is a component of perfumes. Although it occurs naturally in citrus oils, it is produced commercially by hydroformylation of decene.|$|E
50|$|The second {{method for}} the {{synthesis}} of 2-methylundecanal begins with the conversion of <b>undecanal</b> to 2-methyleneundecanal by allowing it to react with formaldehyde {{in the presence of}} base. The 2-methyleneundecanal is then hydrogenated to give 2-methylundecanal. The required <b>undecanal</b> is generated from 1-decene by hydroformylation. The resulting solution is over 50% 2-methyleneundecanal. The double bond of this compound is hydrogenated and the resulting 2-methylundecanal is separated from the by-products using fractional distillation.|$|E

50|$|The main {{chemical}} compounds {{found in the}} essential oil of Plectranthus amboinicus according to one analysis are carvacrol (28.65%), thymol (21.66%), α-humulene (9.67%), <b>undecanal</b> (8.29%), γ-terpinene (7.76%), ρ-cymene (6.46%), caryophyllene oxide (5.85%), α-terpineol (3.28%) and β-selinene (2.01%). Another analysis obtained thymol (41.3%), carvacrol (13.25%), 1,8-cineole (5.45%), eugenol (4.40%), caryophyllene (4.20%), terpinolene (3.75%), α-pinene (3.20%), β-pinene (2.50%), methyl eugenol (2.10%), and β-phellandrene (1.90%). Other studies showed carvacrol as the main constituent of P. amboinicus oil, and at even higher concentrations than in the first analysis shown above.

40|$|Bracon hebetor is a larval ectoparasitoid that {{utilizes}} several pests {{belonging to}} the family Pyralidae (Lepidoptera) as hosts. In the present study, we analyzed the kairomonal response of this wasp to the male-produced sex pheromone of a host, the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella, an economically important pest of honeybees, Apis mellifera. Coupled gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) revealed three compounds in headspace collections from male G. mellonella that elicited responses from B. hebetor antennae: decanal and the previously identified sex pheromone components, nonanal and <b>undecanal.</b> Y-tube olfactometer tests that used na < ve, mated wasps showed that females, but not males, were highly attracted to (a) male G. mellonella headspace samples, (b) two synthetic blends of nonanal and <b>undecanal</b> (in ratios matching that found in male moth samples), and (c) the two aldehydes tested individually. Further, female wasps did not discriminate between a blend of aldehydes and male G. mellonella headspace. In dose-response trials that used octanal, nonanal, decanal, and <b>undecanal,</b> no difference in EAG responses of the two sexes was observed, except for <b>undecanal</b> at the second highest dose, for which female antennae showed significantly larger responses than did male antennae. When the two binary blends were tested at different doses, female wasps were significantly attracted to the two highest doses (1 A mu g and 10 A mu g), {{but not to the}} lowest dose (100 ng). Our results show that females of this economically important parasitoid utilize the male-produced sex pheromone of a host as an indirect cue to guide them to potential oviposition sites...|$|E

The odors were presented to captive coyotes at the Hopland Field Station and the length of time coyotes responded to the odors was recorded. Octanal, nonanal, decanal, and <b>undecanal</b> all elicited as much sniffing and rub-rolling as did a known coyote attractant, trimethylammo-nium decanoate (TMAD). Generally male and female coyotes were equally attracted to the odors; however, nonanal was preferred by males in summer and by females in winter. In comparison to TMAD, some alde-hydes were effective in eliciting sniffing and rub-rolling but ineffective in eliciting lick-chewing and biting. Thus, the aldehydes are probably best suited as odor attractants for use with capture devices such as the steel trap, and least suited for use with toxicant-delivery systems such as the M- 44...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric aerosol {{is known}} to have a direct effect on the {{radiative}} forcing of the climate by absorbing and scattering light and an indirect effect by acting as cloud condensation nuclei. Organic aerosol (OA), sometimes the major contributor to atmospheric aerosol, contains highly oxidized, multifunctional, low vapor pressure organic compounds. Carbonyls {{play a significant role in}} the photochemistry of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) as the near-UV absorption spectra of SOA are dominated by the C=O &# 960;*←n transition. SOA photochemistry can be expected to be driven in part by the well known photochemical reactions of carbonyls such as Norrish and Yang mechanisms. Therefore, investigating a model carbonyl, such as a linear chain aldehyde, in an environment that mimics SOA should provide valuable information on the mechanism and rate of photochemical processes occurring in SOA. The pure form of an aldehyde will act as its own SOA-like organic matrix. The quantum yield of photolysis may be suppressed in the condensed-phase, but might still be significantly high to make photolysis relevant. A C 11 aldehyde, <b>undecanal,</b> is investigated in this thesis as a model for this carbonyl photochemistry in OA. <b>Undecanal</b> photolysis was investigated at room temperature in liquid and gas phases. Products were analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry or proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry. The products, quantum yields, and rate constants of <b>undecanal</b> in each environment were compared. Results suggest that the loss of carbonyls due to photolysis in the condensed-phase should be just as important as the photochemistry in the gas-phase...|$|E
40|$|Structural and {{molecular}} dynamics studies {{have pointed out}} the role of aromatic residues in the uptake of ligand by porcine odorant-binding protein (pOBP). The shift of Tyr 82 from its position during {{the opening of the}} binding cavity has been shown, and was supposed to participate in the entrance of the ligand. Several Phe residues in the vicinity of Tyr 82 could also participate in the binding process. To clarify their involvement, we performed molecular dynamics studies to simulate the dissociation of <b>undecanal,</b> a ligand previously co-crystallized with pOBP. The results confirmed the key-role of Tyr 82 and pointed out the participation of Phe 35 in controlling the reorientation of <b>undecanal</b> towards the exit. To bring experimental support to both published (binding) and present simulations (dissociation), we have mutated these two residues and over expressed the wild type pOBP, the two single mutants and the double mutant in the yeast Pichia pastoris. As fluorescence spectroscopy implies the uptake of the fluorescent probe and release in displacement experiments, we monitored the binding ability of the four proteins for 1 -aminoanthracene (1 -AMA). The experimental results indicated that both residues are involved in the uptake of ligand as the three mutated proteins were unable to bind 1 -AMA, contrary to the wild type recombinant pOBP that bound 1 -AMA with the expected affinity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The braconid Dendrosoter protuberans and the pteromalid Cheiropachus quadrum are two parasitoids of {{the olive}} bark beetle, Phloeotribus scarabaeoides. Several {{chemicals}} such as a-pinene, b-pinene, 2 -decanone, 2 -nonanone, decanal, <b>undecanal,</b> and n-butyl acetate {{have been identified as}} attractants in the laboratory for this scolytid. Under red light at 27 ∘C in a laboratory olfactometer both parasitoids oriented positively to both enantiomers of a-pinene, and females also responded to 2 -decanone. Significant responses did not occur under white light or at lower temperatures. These results suggest that a-pinene and 2 -decanone could be involved in the location of P. scarabaeoides by its parasitoids. Consequently an attracticidal control tactic for this scolytid that included these chemicals could eliminate part of the parasitoid population.

Rearing single pregnant females clarified that this species reproduces 71 unisexual offspring and has a preference for fungus as food. 2. Mating behaviors of B. paupera consisted {{of a series of}} stereotyped malebehaviors including intermittent wing fanning (WF), walking with a zigzagapproach (ZA) while continuing WF, abdomen curling (AC) forward beneaththe thorax while using his claspers to grab the female abdomen, pivoting 180 degrees around body axis and mating occurrence (MO). 3. Female flies emit volatile sex pheromone from the body surface from thelater pupal stage until death. Female cuticular sex pheromone evokes aseries of copulating behavior and causes strong chemotaxis flight in malesirrelative of the dial periodicity. 4. Male flies begin sexual responses 30 min after adult eclosion and responseincrease to a maximum at 2 hr after emergence. 5. Low light intensity depresses male flight activity, but not other locomotoractivity, low illumination has no affect on close range mating behavior. 6. Properly setting of antenna preparations and use of the correct saline allowsfor recording of electrophysiological responses from tiny antennae of male B. paupera based on ordinary amplifier facilities. 7. n-Aldehydes of C 6 -C 18, 2 -ketones of C 16 -C 21 and n-hydrocarbons ofC 10 -C 26 were identified from female cuticular lipids. 2 -ketone of C 16 -C 21 and n-aldehydes of C 6 -C 9 are also common in male cuticular lipids. 8. Male antenna responded with comparatively more sensitivity to n-aldehydesthan 2 -ketones and n-hydrocarbons. In n-hydrocarbons males were moresensitive to carbon chains of C 11 -C 12 than longer or shorter ones. Femaleantennae were more sensitive to food related compound s than extracts of amate. 9. n-Aldehydes of C 10 -C 13, n-hydrocarbons of C 11 -C 13 and other chemicalswith structure similar to <b>undecanal</b> elicited typical sex pheromonalbehaviors in males.

These abnormalities include the contractility and hyperproduction of inflammatory proteins. To develop therapeutic strategies, key pathological mechanisms and putative clinical targets need to be identified. In the present study, we demonstrated that the human olfactory receptors (ORs) OR 1 D 2 and OR 2 AG 1 are expressed at the RNA and protein levels in HASMCs. Using fluorometric calcium imaging, specific agonists for OR 2 AG 1 and OR 1 D 2 were identified to trigger transient Ca 2 + increases in HASMCs via a cAMP-dependent signal transduction cascade. Furthermore, the activation of OR 2 AG 1 via amyl butyrate inhibited the histamine-induced contraction of HASMCs, whereas the stimulation of OR 1 D 2 with bourgeonal led {{to an increase in}} cell contractility. In addition, OR 1 D 2 activation induced the secretion of IL- 8 and GM-CSF. Both effects were inhibited by the specific OR 1 D 2 antagonist <b>undecanal.</b> We herein provide the first evidence to show that ORs are functionally expressed in HASMCs and regulate pathophysiological processes.

It has been fairly well established that, in mammals, the activation of olfactory receptors by odorants does not depend on the presence of OBPs but the very large concentration of these proteins in the nasal mucus indicates their importance in the olfactory signaling cascade. Among several possible roles for OBPs in the first events of olfaction, it has been proposed that they function as passive transporters of hydrophobic odorant molecules through the aqueous mucus. However, despite the large amount of experimental information, there was no strong support for this hypothesis and the OBP’s precise physiological role is still elusive.

40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{was developed for}} the rapid determination of sensory quality deviations of hazelnuts. The method {{is based on the}} investigation of aroma spectra via direct thermal desorption of lipids and on the identification of relevant components using a time of flight mass spectrometer after chromatographic separation (DTD/Fast-GC/TOF-MS). The sample preparation is quite simple and the application as fast-GC shortens the analysis time substantially. Small deviations in the sensory impression correlated with measurable changes in the aroma profile obtained by the developed method. A classification and consequently an evaluation {{of the quality of the}} nuts was achieved using different models of statistical evaluation and discriminant analysis. The compounds used as markers for quality deviations of hazelnuts in the DTD/Fast-GC/TOF-MS analysis were identified by applying aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) and olfactory investigations of thermal desorbed oils from hazelnuts (TCT-HRGC-O).

Analysis of the oils by gas chromatography (GC) -mass spectrometry revealed the presence of 43 constituents, of which α-pinene, dodecanal and n-dodecanol were the major components in all cultivars. Solutions containing 100 ppm of the oils exhibited oviposition deterrent activities against gravid Ae. aegypti females. GC analysis with electroantennographic detection indicated that the oil constituents n-decanol, 2 -undecanone, <b>undecanal,</b> dodecanal, trans-caryophyllene, (E) -β-farnesene, α-humulene, n-dodecanol, isodaucene and dodecanoic acid were able to trigger antennal depolarization in Ae. aegypti females. Bioassays confirmed that solutions containing 50 ppm of n-dodecanol or dodecanal exhibited oviposition deterrent activities, while a solution containing the alcohol and aldehyde in admixture at concentrations representative of the oil presented an activity similar to that of the 100 ppm oil solution. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations verified that the interaction energies of the long-chain oil components and Ae. aegypti odorant binding protein 1 were quite favorable, indicating that the protein is a possible oviposition deterrent receptor in the antenna of Ae. aegypti...|$|E
40|$|The greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella (L.), is {{a serious}} and {{widespread}} pest of the honeybee, Apis mellifera L. In contrast to most moths, for which long-range mate finding is mediated by female-produced sex pheromones, G. mellonella males attract conspecific females over long distances by emitting large amounts of a characteristic scent in combination with bursts of ultrasonic calls. The male scent for this species was previously identified as a blend of nonanal and <b>undecanal.</b> When these compounds were bioassayed, characteristic short-range sexual behavior, including wing fanning, was triggered in conspecific females, but the aldehyde blend failed to elicit attraction over longer distances. We identified, via analysis and synthesis, a third male-specific compound, 5, 11 -dimethylpentacosane. We show that it acts as a behavioral synergist to the aldehydes. In wind tunnel experiments, very few female moths responded to the aldehyde blend or to 5, 11 -dimethylpentacosane tested separately, but consistently showed orientation and source contact when {{a combination of all}} three compounds was applied. The level of attraction to the three-component mixture was still lower than that to male extract, indicating that the composition of compounds in the synthetic blend is suboptimal, or that additional pheromone components of G. mellonella are yet to be identified. The identification of 5, 11 -dimethylpentacosane is an important step for the development of an efficient long-range attractant that will be integrated with other environmentally safe strategies to reduce damage to beehives caused by wax moths...|$|E
40|$|High-level {{production}} of membrane proteins, particularly of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in heterologous cell systems encounters {{a number of}} difficulties from their inherent hydrophobicity in their transmembrane domains, which frequently cause protein aggregation and cytotoxicity and thus reduce the protein yield. Recent advances in cell-free protein synthesis circumvent those problems to produce membrane proteins with a yield sometimes exceeding the cell-based approach. Here, we report cell-free {{production of}} a human olfactory receptor 17 - 4 (hOR 17 - 4) using the wheat germ extract. Using the simple method, we also successful produced two additional olfactory receptors. To obtain soluble olfactory receptors and to increase yield, we directly added different detergents in varying concentrations to the cell-free reaction. To identify a purification buffer system that maintained the receptor in a nonaggregated form, we developed a method that uses small-volume size-exclusion column chromatography combined with rapid and sensitive dot-blot detection. Different buffer components including salt concentration, various detergents and detergent concentration, and reducing agent and its concentrations were evaluated {{for their ability to}} maintain the cell-free produced protein stable and nonaggregated. The purified olfactory receptor displays a typical a α-helical CD spectrum. Surface plasmon resonance measurements were used to show binding of a known ligand <b>undecanal</b> to hOR 17 - 4. Our approach to produce a high yield of purified olfactory receptor is a milestone toward obtaining a large quantity of olfactory receptors for designing bionic sensors. Furthermore, this simple approach may be broadly useful not only for other classes of GPCRs but also for other membrane proteins...|$|E
40|$|Olfactory {{receptor}} (OR) {{expression is}} {{also present in}} the sperm cells and could mediate sperm chemotaxis. OR 1 D 2 was the first OR expressed in the testis demonstrated {{to be involved in}} chemotaxis and to be expressed also in the nose with a similar behavior. Bourgeonal is the OR 1 D 2 most potent known agonist. Infertility affects ~ 15 % of couples in western countries and sometimes it is unexplained. This pilot study compared the bourgeonal olfactory thresholds, the ability of sperm to sense the bourgeonal and the frequency of 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of OR 1 D 2 gene in nine males suffering of unexplained infertility with a control group of 15 healthy males. The mean olfactory threshold for bourgeonal was statistically different between the study group (10. 5 ± 3. 7; median 12. 3) and the control group (14. 0 ± 2. 8; median 15. 5) (p = 0. 006). Statistical analysis showed a significantly higher percentage of spermatozoa that migrated toward the capillaries filled with bourgeonal in the control group compared to the study group (p < 0. 0001). Sperm migration was equally inhibited in both groups of subjects when, together with bourgeonal, capillaries were filled with <b>undecanal,</b> a strong bourgeonal inhibitor (p = 0. 42). The 13 SNPs of OR 1 D 2 revealed a statistically significant difference for allele and genotype frequency of rs 769423 in study group versus control group (p = 0. 02). The present preliminary study seems to confirm the important role of OR 1 D 2 both in nose and spermatozoa and may explain the idiopathic infertility of the study group. Further studies on larger series are mandatory to confirm our preliminary evidence...|$|E
40|$|Behavioural and {{electrophysiological}} {{responses of}} winged virginoparous Aphis fabae to volatile compounds of faba bean, Vicia faba, were studied and semiochemicals used in host location identified. In olfactometer bioassays, aphids responded positively to V. faba volatiles from an intact plant. This response also occurred when volatiles from an air entrainment sample of a V. faba plant were tested. Coupled gas chromatography-electroantennography revealed {{the presence of}} 16 electrophysiologically active volatile compounds in the air entrainment sample and 15 of these were identified as (E) - 2 -hexenal, (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, 1 -hexanol, benzaldehyde, 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one, octanal, (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -yl acetate, (R) -linalool, methyl salicylate, decanal, <b>undecanal,</b> (E) -caryophyllene, (E) -β-farnesene, (S) -germacrene D, and (E,E,) - 4, 8, 12 -trimethyl- 1, 3, 7, 11 -tridecatetraene. A synthetic blend consisting of all identified compounds in the same concentration and ratio as in the air entrainment sample elicited a similar behavioural response from the aphids as the air entrainment sample. Each compound was tested for behavioural activity individually at the same concentration as in the air entrainment sample and subsequently over a range of different doses. It {{was found that the}} response to the complete blend was not due to a response to a single compound. Dose response experiments also revealed ten of the compounds elicited negative behavioural responses from aphids. Further behavioural experiments revealed that these responses were context-specific and behavioural activity of individual compounds was different when they were presented alongside other compounds in the blend. It was hypothesised that a blend of host volatiles in a species-specific ratio may be used by A. fabae to recognise its host. To determine whether or not ratios of volatiles could provide a reliable cue to host seeking aphids, intra-specific and diurnal variation of ratios of volatiles emitted were investigated. Although considerable variation in ratios was observed the quantities of some pairs of compounds were positively correlated, indicating a degree of consistency in the ratios.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 A {{practical}} and versatile instrument {{has been developed}} both to optimize the chemistry of bio- and chemiluminescence reactions and to measure ultra-trace quantities of associated analytes. The instrument consists of a pneumatic flow injection system linked to a detection cell and a signal processing and readout system. The disk-like cell is defined {{by a pair of}} transparent polycarbonate plates and an " 0 -ring" seal. The lower plate is fitted with a reflective surface. Relative to conventional cells, this design affords a high light collection efficiency due to the large volume element viewed by an end-on photomultiplier detector. Rapid mixing of reagents within the cell is brought about by injection through concentric ports of a commercial burner assembly at a point immediately below the detector. The signal processing and readout system is interfaced to an IBM compatible personal computer and appropriate software was written to automate the instrument and to acquire, store and manipulate luminescence data. With this instrumentation, the chemistry of marine bacteria biolumin-escence was optimized for the determination of cis- 11 -hexadecenal and, ostensibly, for both the quantification of aldehyde insect pheromones and potential use in the control of insect pests. With the optimized conditions, cis- 11 -hexadecenal was determined to 7 fmol. This value is more than an order of magnitude lower than detection limits for aldehyde pheromones reported in the literature. In this research, the less ideal substrates <b>undecanal</b> and heptanal were determined to 570 fmol and 65 pmol, respectively. Marine bacteria bioluminescence was used to quantify several epoxide analytes derivatized to aldehydes. 1, 2 -epoxyhexadecane and 1, 2 - epoxytetradecane were determined to 55 and 51 fmol, respectively. 1, 2 - epoxyoctane and cis- 7, 8 -epoxy- 2 -methyloctadecane were determined to 100 and 3 pmol, respectively. The latter compound is the sex pheromone of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), a well-known and serious agricultural pest. Epoxides have not been quantified previously with either chemi- or bioluminescence. The instrument was modified for use with corrosive solutions and for possible interfacing with a high performance liquid chromatograph. Lophine chemiluminescence was optimized for the analysis of Cr(VI) samples. With the optimized conditions, aqueous solutions of Cr(VI) were determined to 50 μg /L. A plausible explanation is offered for the dependence of lophine chemiluminescence on the concentration of the chromium species...|$|E
40|$|A cold fiber {{solid phase}} microextraction device was {{designed}} and constructed based {{on the use of}} a thermoelectric cooler (TEC). A three-stage thermoelectric cooler was used for cooling a copper rod coated with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) hollow fiber, which served as the SPME fiber. The copper rod was mounted on a commercial SPME plunger and exposed to the cold surface of the TEC, which was enclosed in a small aluminum box. A heat sink and a fan dissipated the generated heat at the hot side of the TEC. By applying an appropriate DC voltage to the TEC, {{the upper part of the}} copper rod, which was in contact to the cold side of the TEC, was cooled and the hollow fiber reached a lower temperature through heat transfer. A thermocouple was embedded in the cold side of the TEC for indirect measurement of the fiber temperature. A portable cold fiber SPME device was made by using a car battery as the power supply. The cold fiber SPME device with thermoelectric cooling was applied in quantitative analysis of off-flavors in rice. Hexanal, nonanal, and <b>undecanal</b> were chosen as three test analytes in rice. These analytes were identified according to their retention times and analyzed with a GC/FID instrument. Headspace extraction conditions (i. e. extraction temperature and extraction time) were optimized. Standard addition calibration graphs were obtained at the optimized conditions and the concentrations of the three analytes were calculated. The developed method was compared to a conventional solvent extraction method. The applicability of the portable cold fiber SPME with TEC for field sampling was tested. The effect of cooling on extraction recovery and the reproducibility of extraction were examined for extractions from an n-alkane flow through system. It was found that the extraction recoveries were significantly higher when the fiber was cooled. To further investigate the effect of cooling on the sensitivity of SPME in field sampling, the portable cold fiber SPME was used for extraction of volatile components from living wisteria flowers. Both the number of identified compounds and the related peak areas increased for extractions with cold PDMS fiber relative to without cooling and commercial PDMS and PA fibers. The portable cold fiber SPME device was also used for field sampling of volatile components of living lily-of-the-valley flowers and the extracted compounds were analyzed with GC/MS. The desorption kinetics of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) from environmental solid matrices was investigated using cold fiber SPME with CO 2 cooling. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and selected volatile organic compounds (i. e. toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene) were used as test analytes. Sand, silica gel, and clay were used as laboratory model solid matrices and were contaminated by the test analytes. Certified sediments were used as naturally contaminated samples. In this approach, the organic compounds, released from contaminated solid samples at different elevated temperatures, were exhaustively extracted with cold fiber SPME over different extraction times. The extraction data were used to obtain desorption and Arrhenius plots. The rate constants of desorption and activation energies of desorption were measured for each contaminant using these plots. The results were comparable to those reported in the literature...|$|E
