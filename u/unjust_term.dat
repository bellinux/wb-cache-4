5000|$|The High Court {{rejected}} Telstra’s {{interpretation of}} Section 152EB {{by stating that}} the said provision refers to determinations that would [...] "result in" [...] an acquisition of property on <b>unjust</b> <b>terms,</b> and not to determinations that would [...] "effect" [...] such an acquisition. The High Court also pointed {{to the fact that}} Telstra’s argument involves a dispute about the terms and conditions of complying with the service access obligations fixed by ACCC determinations, thus enabling the operation of Section 152EB.|$|R
50|$|Telstra {{rejected}} {{the regulation of}} ULLS and LSS under Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act, alleging that the wholesale access price caps imposed on it by the ACCC do not allow it to recover the operating costs of the actual service being accessed and retailed by a competitor, alleging that this amounted to a compulsory acquisition of Telstra property by the Commonwealth, and access-seeking competitors, on <b>unjust</b> <b>terms</b> contrary to Section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. Section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution states that the Parliament has legislative power to create laws relating to:the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there is the}} {{potential}} for inefficient, and even <b>unjust,</b> <b>terms</b> to be accepted by signatories to these contracts. Such terms might be seen as unjust if they allow the seller to avoid all liability or unilaterally modify terms or terminate the contract. These terms often come in the form of, but are not limited to, forum selection clauses and mandatory arbitration clauses, which can limit or foreclose a party's access to the courts; and also liquidated damages clauses, which set a limit to the amount that can be recovered or require a party to pay a specific amount. They might be inefficient if they place the risk of a negative outcome, such as defective manufacturing, on the buyer who is not {{in the best position to}} take precautions.|$|R
50|$|The {{movement}} received impetus after Hungary's {{defeat in}} World War I. Under {{the terms of}} the Treaty of Trianon (1920), the new Hungarian state constituted only 32.7% of the territory of historic, pre-treaty Hungary, and lost 58.4% of its total population. More than 3.2 million ethnic Hungarians - one-third of all Hungarians - resided outside the new boundaries of Hungary, in the successor states, under oppressive conditions. Old Hungarian cities of great cultural importance like Bratislava (a former capital of the country), Kassa, and Kolozsvár were lost. Under these circumstances no Hungarian government could survive without seeking justice for Magyars and Hungary. Reuniting the Magyars became a crucial point in public life and on the political agenda. Outrage led many to reject Europe and turn towards the East in search of new friends and allies in a bid to revise the <b>unjust</b> <b>terms</b> of the treaty and restore integrity of Hungary.|$|R
6000|$|I have no {{hesitation}} in saying that, {{as compared with}} the ancient and stereotyped conceptions of the [...] "Taking down from the Cross," [...] there is a living feeling in that picture which is of great price. It may perhaps be weak, nay, even superficial, or untenable--that will depend on the other conditions of character out of which it springs--but, so far as it reaches, it is pure and good; and we may gain more by looking thoughtfully at such a picture than at any even of the least formal types of the work of older schools. It would be unfair to compare it with first-rate, or even approximately first-rate designs; but even accepting such <b>unjust</b> <b>terms,</b> put it beside Rembrandt's ghastly white sheet, laid over the two poles at the Cross-foot, and see which has most good in it for you of any communicable kind.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} a {{critical}} analysis of the High Court's decision in Telstra Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth, in which Telstra argued unsuccessfully that {{the application of the}} telecommunications access regime, established under Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act, to the ULLS and LSS, was an acquisition of property on <b>unjust</b> <b>terms,</b> contrary to s 51 (xxxi) of the Constitution. Although the article does not disagree with the High Court's decision on the facts of this case, it contends that the narrow focus of the judgment, which is based mainly on the historically contingent circumstances that a telecommunications access regime was implemented prior to the privatisation of Telstra, provides little guidance {{about the extent to which}} future regulatory interventions may breach s 51 (xxxi). The court's expansive understanding of what amounts to an 'acquisition of property' under s 51 (xxxi), however, suggests that proposals for greater regulatory intervention, such as proposals for structural separation involving, for example, divestiture of the CAN, may well amount to a breach of s 51 (xxxi), thereby requiring payment of compensation to Telstra...|$|R
50|$|The {{argument}} made on Telstra’s behalf focused {{directly on}} Sections 152AL(3) and 152AR of the Trade Practices Act, and asked whether these two Sections, in their applications to ULL and LSS, were beyond the legislative powers of parliament {{by way of}} Section 51(xxxi). Therefore, rejecting the validity of Sections 152AL(3) and 152AR which it claimed affect an unconstitutional acquisition of Telstra property by the Commonwealth on <b>unjust</b> <b>terms.</b> As mentioned earlier these two Sections provide for the declaration of services by the ACCC and impose standard access obligations, terms and conditions which include the monetary price bracket limiting what Telstra is allowed to charge its competitors for access to declared services. If then, as Telstra continued to argue, terms and conditions may be fixed for its compliance with standard access obligations in respect to local loops, ULL and LSS, which are terms that differ from those that would be fixed in arm’s length (all parties being independent and equal) bargaining {{between it and the}} access seeker, the provisions that lead to that result provide for an acquisition of property otherwise than on just terms.|$|R
5000|$|Telstra {{submitted}} {{that this}} conclusion is not denied by the provisions of Section 152EB which deal expressly with the subject of just terms. If a Commonwealth law provides for the acquisition of property on <b>unjust</b> <b>terms,</b> then Section 51(xxxi) renders that law invalid, since it is beyond the legislative powers of the Commonwealth to create such a law, then Section 152EB, the final provision of Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act, acts to save that law from invalidity, via reasonable compensation by the Commonwealth. Telstra argued that this provision did not save the impugned provisions from invalidity stating that relevant acquisitions [...] "occur by the imposition of the standard access obligations on carriers or providers pursuant to Section 152AR" [...] and not by any ACCC determination. Furthermore, any acquisition only comes into operation when a relevant request for the service is made by a provider, and not by any ACCC determination. Telstra stated that Section 152EB should be considered engaged only in respect to determinations that effect an acquisition, {{and that the only}} relevant determinations are those made by the ACCC. Thus, Telstra argued, this provision did not apply to any acquisition effected by Section 152AR since the relevant acquisition is effected by the provider’s request for access engaging the standard obligations under Section 152AR, and not by any determination made by the ACCC.|$|R
40|$|En diciembre de 2011, Australia promulgó la Tobacco Plain Packaging Act (TPP Act), que ordena distribuir los cigarrillos en cajetillas uniformes, con mensajes sobre los peligros de fumar y con un espacio mínimo para la marca, todas en igual tipografía y sin derecho a incluir elementos distintivos. Las grandes tabacaleras demandaron esta ley alegando que era inconstitucional o pidiendo que no se les aplicara por constituir adquisición de propiedad sin condiciones justas, en su caso propiedad industrial. El presente artículo empieza contando la historia del empacado llano. Describe el sistema legal australiano, el fallo y algunos resultados posibles. Además, propone una serie de conclusiones como una reflexión sobre distintos aspectos de la llamada nueva economía.

All of these packs were to use the same font and no distinctive elements. Big tobacco companies challenged the constitutionality of this act. These companies asked that, if the act were to be considered constitutional, it should not be applied to them because it would amount to an acquisition of property—industrial property in this case—on <b>unjust</b> <b>terms.</b> This article begins by telling the story of plain packaging.

5000|$|The High Court {{held that}} there were three key factors {{on the history of}} the Australian {{communications}} industry that led to the conclusion that operation of the access regime did not result in an acquisition of property on <b>unjust</b> <b>terms.</b> Firstly the PSTN (including the local loops in dispute) which Telstra now [...] "owns" [...] was originally owned by the Commonwealth itself. Secondly, prior to the vesting of the PSTN (and local loops) in Telstra’s predecessor, the Telecommunications Act 1991 had commenced on 1 July 1991, establishing the access regime that gave competitors the rights to interconnect to the PSTN and to obtain access to services it supplies. Thirdly, at the time the PSTN was vested in Telstra, Telstra was wholly owned by the Commonwealth. And so it was maintained that when the PSTN was transferred from the Commonwealth to Telstra’s predecessor, Telstra’s right over the network were always subject to the access rights of its competitors to its network and services. Thus, the High Court unanimously dismissed Telstra’s case holding that Sections 152AL(3) and 152AR of the Trade Practices Act were not invalid and that Telstra never actually owned any of the assets that comprise the PSTN except under and in accordance with the legislative provisions for [...] "promoting ... competition in the telecommunications industry generally and among carriers". Furthermore, it was stated that Telstra’s argument was [...] "synthetic and unreal" [...] because it was based on an assumption that Telstra has greater rights over the PSTN than it actually has.|$|R

60|$|There is a {{sentiment}} in the human mind that regulates benevolence in its application as a principle of action. This {{is the sense of}} justice. Justice, as well as benevolence, is an elementary law of human nature. It is through this principle that men are impelled to distribute any means of pleasure which benevolence may suggest the communication of to others, in equal portions among an equal number of applicants. If ten men are shipwrecked on a desert island, they distribute whatever subsistence may remain to them, into equal portions among themselves.

40|$|Standard form {{contracts}} are drafted in advance by the supplier of {{goods or services}} and presented to the consumer on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. The consumer’s only choice is to adhere to, or refuse to adhere to, {{the terms of the}} standard form contracts. They have various advantages for both contracting parties such as cost saving and uniformity. They also have some disadvantages as they are one-sided against consumers and impose unfair terms to the contracting party. Once a contract is signed, it must be honoured. However, public policy can be used to rescue the person from greatly unfair obligations that arise from the contracts. Public policy derives from the Constitution and the fundamental values it enshrines. Consequently, a contractual term that violates the Constitution is contrary to public policy and unenforceable. The Consumer Protection Act (CPA) has a significant impact on standard form contracts. It imposes a duty on the supplier to draw the attention of the customer to the exemption clauses or other contractual terms that oust common law protection. However, the CPA applies only to transactions between suppliers and consumers. The prohibition of unfair, unreasonable or <b>unjust</b> contract <b>terms</b> should apply to every contract. Parliament should intervene and enact legislation to prevent the abuse of freedom of contract by the strong party, to the detriment of other contracting party...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how a wiki {{can be used}} to deliver greater justice {{in the form of a}} fairer grade to students who report that not all members of their group made a reasonable contribution to an assignment. While group assessment has many pedagogical and professional benefits, it is fraught with potentially <b>unjust</b> outcomes in <b>terms</b> of the marks assigned to individual students. Free-riders can unjustly receive marks for work that they have not contributed to and they may even drag down the group marks due to their non-performance. We describe how a wiki was used in an auditing group assignment to provide evidence of individual student contributions following reports of unequal contributions by group members. It was found that the wiki provided a relatively more objective basis than traditional document-based assignments to inform the decision as to whether or not all students in the group would receive the same grade and if not, how the grades should be modified. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{memorandum of}} decision was rendered by Hon •. Samuel 0.

The action which is now pending in that Court is for the loss of goods shipped by the,plaintiff over defendant 2 ̆ 7 s railroad. The plaintiff stated in one count that the goods were delivered to the defendant as a common carrier at common law; that at the time of the delivery of the goods certain bills of lading were also delivered to and accepted by the defendant, but that there was no consideration for the bills of lading, that they were unreasonable and <b>unjust</b> in their <b>terms,</b> and that therefore they were not binding contracts, and that the defendant had no right to the limitation of liability expressed therein. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff claimed that, in spite of the bills of lading, the defendant was liable as a common carrier at common law, and alleged the failure of the defendant to carry and deliver the goods. The plaintiff went on to say that if the bills of lading were valid, then the defendant was liable because the goods were lost through its negligence...|$|R
