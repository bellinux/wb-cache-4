5|$|As in 1884, the {{election}} {{focused on the}} swing states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana. But <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> year, when Cleveland had triumphed in all four, in 1888 he won only two, losing {{his home state of}} New York by 14,373 votes. The Republicans won Indiana, largely {{as the result of a}} fraudulent voting practice known as Blocks of Five. Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to return to private life.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly larvae, caterpillars, {{have a hard}} (sclerotised) {{head with}} strong mandibles used for cutting their food, most often leaves. They have {{cylindrical}} bodies, with ten segments to the abdomen, generally with short prolegs on segments 3–6 and 10; the three pairs of true legs on the thorax have five segments each. Many are well camouflaged; others are aposematic with bright colours and bristly projections containing toxic chemicals obtained from their food plants. The pupa or chrysalis, <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of moths, is not wrapped in a cocoon.|$|E

5|$|He {{was found}} guilty and punished posthumously for the crime of treason. The Senate had his {{property}} proscribed, forbade mourning on his account, removed images of his likeness, such as statues and portraits, and his name was erased {{from the base of}} one statue in particular as part of his damnatio memoriae. Yet, in a show of clemency not <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of the emperor, the Senate had Piso's property returned and divided equally between his two sons, on condition that his daughter Calpurnia be given 1,000,000 sesterces as dowry and a further 4,000,000 as personal property. His wife Placina was absolved.|$|E
5|$|Her {{education}} was extremely limited. She {{was able to}} attend a Congregationalist Sunday school where she learned to read and write. Congregationalist doctrine, <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of the Church of England at the time, emphasised {{the importance of education}} for the poor. Her prized possession was a bound volume of the Dissenters' Theological Magazine and Review, in which the family's pastor, the Reverend James Wheaton, had published two essays, one insisting that God had created the world in six days, the other urging dissenters to study the new science of geology.|$|E
5|$|Like the House of the Lake, most {{houses in}} the crowded Theatre Quarter of Delos have irregular-shaped floor plans (such as {{trapezoidal}} designs), as opposed to square or rectangular designs. The narrow and irregular street grid is <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of other quarters, where streets usually meet at approximately right angles. Similar {{to the majority of}} excavated homes of Delos, those in the Theatre Quarter feature an open courtyard without porticoes, instead of the peristyle layout with columns. Some of the {{houses in the}} Theatre Quarter lack interior decoration altogether, with neither wall murals nor mosaics, which is unusual for most Delian homes.|$|E

5|$|Sherlock Holmes Baffled is a {{very short}} American silent film created in 1900 with {{cinematography}} by Arthur Marvin. It is the earliest known film to feature Arthur Conan Doyle's detective character Sherlock Holmes, albeit in a form <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of later screen incarnations. The inclusion of the character also makes it the first recorded detective film. In the film, a thief who can appear and disappear at will steals a sack of items from Sherlock Holmes. At each point, Holmes's attempts to thwart the intruder end in failure.|$|E
5|$|Sigurd {{was in the}} {{fortunate}} position that on his accession to the earldom there {{seem to have been}} no other serious contenders.

5|$|The Zong {{massacre}} {{has inspired}} several works of literature. Fred D'Aguiar's novel Feeding the Ghosts (1997) {{tells the story}} of an African who survives being thrown overboard from the Zong. In the novel, the journal of the slave—Mintah—is lost, <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of Granville Sharp. According to the cultural historian Anita Rupprecht, this signifies the silencing of African voices about the massacre.|$|E
5000|$|... "The unique {{characteristics}} they exhibit just don't {{fit into the}} other groups of apes", says Williams.

5|$|The adult sarus crane is {{very large}} with grey wings and body; a bare red head {{and part of}} the upper neck; a greyish crown; and a long greenish-grey pointed bill. In flight, the long neck is held straight, <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of an heron, which folds it back, and the black wing tips can be seen; the crane's long pink legs trail behind them. This bird has a grey ear covert patch, an orange-red iris and a greenish-grey bill. Juveniles have a {{yellowish}} base to the bill and the brown-grey head is fully feathered.|$|E
5|$|The {{systemic}} {{heart has}} muscular contractile walls {{and consists of}} a single ventricle and two atria, one for {{each side of the}} body. The blood vessels consist of arteries, capillaries and veins and are lined with a cellular endothelium which is quite <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of most other invertebrates. The blood circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the vena cavae, after which the blood is pumped through the gills by the auxiliary hearts and back to the main heart. Much of the venous system is contractile, which helps circulate the blood.|$|E
5|$|Though {{a myriad}} of bones was {{available}} by 1969, many important ones were missing or hard to interpret. There were few postorbital skull elements, no femurs, no sacrum, no furcula or sternum, missing vertebrae, and (Ostrom thought) only a tiny fragment of a coracoid. Ostrom's skeletal reconstruction of Deinonychus included a very unusual pelvic bone– a pubis that was trapezoidal and flat, <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of other theropods, but which was the same length as the ischium and which was found right next to it.|$|E

5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>that</b> of his contemporary, the Finn Jean Sibelius, Nielsen's {{reputation}} abroad did {{not start}} to evolve until after World War II. For some time, international interest was largely directed towards his symphonies while his other works, many of them highly popular in Denmark, have only recently started {{to become part of}} the world repertoire. Even in Denmark, many of his compositions failed to impress. It was only in 1897 after the first performance of Hymnus amoris that he received support from the critics, to be substantially reinforced in 1906 by their enthusiastic reception of Masquerade.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens have a {{wide range}} of vocalizations which are of {{interest}} to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant prruk-prruk-prruk call, which to experienced listeners is <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking toc-toc-toc, a dry, grating kraa, a low guttural rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the viper dogfish captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape {{allows it to}} swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of other dogfish sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines and bottom trawls. The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E

5|$|Following its predecessors, Brawl uses {{a battle}} system <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of typical {{fighting}} games. Players {{can choose from}} a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents off the screen as they fight on various stages. The characters in Brawl include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as the well-known Mario and Pikachu. Instead of using traditional health bars that start at a maximum value and lose value, Brawl characters start the game with 0%; the value rises as they take damage and may rise over 100% {{to a maximum of}} 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies further back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a life, a point, or coins, depending on the mode of play. Brawl includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with their chosen username.|$|E
5|$|Mycena mustea {{is similar}} to the North American species M.umbrinovinosa, which is {{distinguished}} by having a vinaceous-brown to purplish-black cap, irregularly shaped cheilocystidia that are covered at their tips with long, flexuous excrescences, and clamp connections. Mycena mustea is also similar to the European species M.urania, which differs in its blackish-violet cap, broadly club-shaped cheilocystidia covered with numerous, evenly spaced warts, and clamp connections. Mycena mustea also resembles the Japanese M.fonticola, a species described concurrently with M.mustea. <b>Unlike</b> <b>that</b> of M.fonticola, the cap of M.mustea typically becomes pale grayish-purple when mature; the cheilocystidia have several short finger-like excrescences at their tips; and the stem cuticle is made up of smooth hyphae. In contrast, the cap of M.fonticola becomes dark violet-brown when mature; there are no excrescences on the cheilocystidia; and the hyphae of the stem cuticle are sparsely covered with diverticulae that resemble warts or fingers.|$|E
5|$|The {{season was}} one of the best in the team's history, with 20 {{victories}} and a Tour de France with multiple noteworthy performances. Team leader Thomas Voeckler wore the yellow jersey as race leader for ten days; the second such occurrence of his career, after also leading for ten days in 2004. <b>Unlike</b> <b>that</b> race, however, Voeckler poised himself as a serious overall contender and took fourth place overall; the best result by a French rider since 2000. While he spent most of the Tour riding in Voeckler's service, Pierre Rolland won one of the marquee stages, up Alpe d'Huez, eventually finishing 11th overall and winning the young rider classification.|$|E
