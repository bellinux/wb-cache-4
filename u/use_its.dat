5|$|A second Overmind {{is created}} in Brood War, formed from {{the merging of}} several cerebrates. This second Overmind never reaches full maturity, and thus lacks the power and {{intelligence}} of the original and is much weaker; attacks that were superficial to the first Overmind send the second into remission, although dark templar energies are still needed to kill it. The second Overmind is captured and drugged by the United Earth Directorate, who <b>use</b> <b>its</b> control of the Swarm to bolster its own forces in the Koprulu Sector, but it is ultimately slain by Zeratul.|$|E

5|$|Because {{its feet}} are located so far {{back on its}} body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, but it can <b>use</b> <b>its</b> feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of {{covering}} ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea. It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above {{the surface of the}} water.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the class}} was {{designed}} with reconnaissance, small scale minelaying and special operations in mind, it does not possess any offensive weapons such as torpedoes. The submarine was to <b>use</b> <b>its</b> small dimensions to easily maneuver in the relatively shallow waters of the Adriatic sea, staying undetected and transporting up to six special forces personnel who had 612 limpet mines and four AIM-M70 (M70/1) bottom mines or four R-1 submersibles at their disposal. Velebit had a crew of four.|$|E

The animals conserve energy in the colder winter months by reducing movement, often {{to the point of}} complete inactivity.|$|E
