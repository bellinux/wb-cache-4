5|$|After {{considerable}} {{debate and}} various experiments, {{the law was}} changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play the new version, which is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances {{if they did not}} attempt to hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.|$|E

There are encouraging developments in cellulosic decomposition that might enable grass or tree crops to be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> end in future and which may prove to have lower net carbon emissions than other production techniques.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, the German surgeon Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844–1924) {{published}} a paper describing {{the first successful}} elective human tracheotomy to be performed {{for the purpose of}} administration of general anesthesia. In 1888, Sir Morell Mackenzie (1837–1892) {{published a}} book discussing the indications for tracheotomy. In the early 20th century, tracheotomy became a life-saving treatment for patients afflicted with paralytic poliomyelitis who required mechanical ventilation. In 1909, Philadelphia laryngologist Chevalier Jackson (1865–1958) described a technique for tracheotomy that is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, the Estonian {{astronomer}} Ernst Öpik gave {{a distance}} determination {{that supported the}} theory that the Andromeda Nebula is indeed a distant extra-galactic object. Using the new 100inch Mt. Wilson telescope, Edwin Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too distant {{to be part of the}} Milky Way. In 1936 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, {{research}} chemists in Heilmeier {{group at}} RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed {{only in the}} number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of Schiff base compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22–105°C. Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made. The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points. This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide operating temperature range eventually became the industry standard and is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> very day to tailor materials to meet specific applications.|$|E

5|$|Hitler invited Riefenstahl to {{film the}} 1936 Summer Olympics {{scheduled}} {{to be held in}} Berlin, a film which Riefenstahl claimed had been commissioned by the International Olympic Committee. She visited Greece to take footage of the route of the inaugural torch relay and the games' original site at Olympia, where she was aided by Greek photographer Nelly's. This material became Olympia, a hugely successful film which has since been widely noted for its technical and aesthetic achievements. She {{was one of the first}} filmmakers to use tracking shots in a documentary, placing a camera on rails to follow the athletes' movement. The film is also noted for its slow motion shots. Riefenstahl played with the idea of slow motion, underwater diving shots, extremely high and low shooting angles, panoramic aerial shots, and tracking system shots for allowing fast action. Many of these shots were relatively unheard of at the time, but Leni’s use and augmentation of them set a standard, and is the reason why they are still <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day. Riefenstahl's work on Olympia has been cited as a major influence in modern sports photography. Riefenstahl filmed competitors of all races, including African-American Jesse Owens in what later became famous footage.|$|E

25|$|In 1738, Swiss {{physicist}} and mathematician Daniel Bernoulli published Hydrodynamica which laid {{the basis for}} the kinetic theory of gases. In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, still <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what we experience as heat is simply the kinetic energy of their motion.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} phlogiston (a {{substance}} {{at the root}} of all combustion) was propounded by the German Georg Ernst Stahl in the early 18th century and was only overturned {{by the end of the}} century by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, the chemical analogue of Newton in physics; who did more than any other to establish the new science on proper theoretical footing, by elucidating the principle of conservation of mass and developing a new system of chemical nomenclature <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day.|$|E
25|$|For killer whales, {{researchers}} arbitrarily {{chose the}} left side of the animal as the one to be used for identification. Bigg's team of killer whale photographers and spotters quickly grew to include hundreds of volunteers from along the coast, a project that was eventually formalized in 1999 as the B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network. In 1975, researchers examining thousands of black-and-white photographs began to assemble a catalog containing a photograph of every killer whale in British Columbia's waters, a catalog that has been continually updated and <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day.|$|E
25|$|Dogs {{were often}} used as unit mascots for {{military}} units. The dog in question might be an officer's dog, an animal that the unit chose to adopt, or one of their canines employed in another role as a working dog. Some naval dogs such as Sinbad and Judy were themselves enlisted service members. Some units also chose to employ a particular breed of dog as their standard mascot, with new dogs replacing the old when it died or was retired. The presence of a mascot was designed to uplift morale, and many were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> effect in the trenches of World War I.|$|E
