40|$|Discourse marker {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} research topics in recent years. Many researchers from home and abroad have explored it from various perspectives, including the perspective of discourse coherence; the perspective of syntax-pragmatics; the perspective of cognitive pragmatics and the perspective of metapragmatics. At the same time researchers at home mainly make specific analysis on certain discourse markers in terms of their pragmatic function. Besides, Systemic Functional Linguistics is a branch of Functional Linguistics, being further divided into systemic grammar and functional grammar. Systemic grammar regards language as a system network or meaning potential to explain; while functional grammar intends to prove language is a social interaction manner, emphasizing the function of language. However, at present a few researchers have combined the two fields to study together. Based on the fact and the above theoretical foundation, the paper introduces discourse marker to a broader category and studies it in a new perspective. The paper selects “Honest Phrases ” in two different communication interaction—daily conversation and police interrogation to analyze discourse marker-“Honest Phrases ” using three metafunctions in Systemic Functional Linguistics, aiming to explore its multifunctional mechanism in discourse from perspectives of ideational metafunction, interpersonal metafunction and textual metafunction so as to make up the shortage of the former study perspectives of “Honest Phrases ” and to help people <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>deeply...</b>|$|E
40|$|Music {{composition}} {{is a highly}} interdisciplinary process. To <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>deeply,</b> a number of approaches have been used from different fields, such as musicology, music theory, music cognition and philosophy. During recent decades, numerous techniques based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been proposed. In particular, many AI systems focus on automatic melodic composition. Most of these systems try to generate melodies enjoyable by a human, but they completely ignore {{the way in which}} humans actually compose. Humans create music by exploiting a mixed top-down bottom-up approach, characterised by high-level cognition processes and rules. In this paper, we propose a memetic model for music composition, which considers both psychological and social levels. The former level analyses the actual cognitive mechanisms and procedures involved while composing music: namely, museme network, compositional grammar and evaluation module. The social level puts the figure of the composer into perspective within her musical environment. The introduced memetic model is encoded in a two-step algorithm. Firstly, a top-down approach is used for defining the overall structure of a melody. Secondly, the given structure is filled with musical content, following a bottom-up strategy, that fosters emergent behaviour. The proposed algorithm is the first system we are aware of which can evolve its own compositional style. Stylistic change is achieved by modifying grammar rules and the museme network. Finally, the paper provides an analysis of generated melodies...|$|E
40|$|Agent-based {{models are}} {{becoming}} indispensable tools in building design, safety assessments {{as well as}} management of emergency egress. However, reliable calibrations of these models should be mandatory before they are used in practice. To improve the database for model calibration we present results from two experiments at a T-junction and a corner. In such structures the dynamics of pedestrian streams is complex and up to now not studied systematically. To <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>deeply,</b> series of well-controlled laboratory experiments are conducted. The Voronoi method, {{which is used to}} analyze the experiments, allows high resolution and small fluctuation in time and space. From the results, it is found that the fundamental diagrams of pedestrian flow in T-junction are not the same before and after merging. At the same density, the velocities of pedestrians before merging are smaller than that after merging. To analyze whether turning or merging of the stream is responsible for this discrepancy, we compare the fundamental diagrams of pedestrian flow in T-junction with the flow at a single corner. The fundamental diagrams of the streams in front and behind the corner agree well and are also in accordance with that from T-junction flow after merging. Besides, space-resolved measurements for the density, velocity profiles are obtained using Voronoi method. These maps offer important information about dangerous spots and thus enable to improve egress management and facility design. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E

Obviously, the main point of such a system is to promote and maintain inequality. Conversely, the main point of the Alger myth [...] "is to proclaim that everyone can rise above her station in life. Despite this tension, it is possible for the myth to coexist with social reality. Not surprisingly, then, there are lots of Black folk who subscribe to the Alger myth {{and at the same time}} <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> to be <b>deeply</b> false. They live with the dissonance between myth and reality because both are helpful and healthful in dealing with ‘the adverse events of life. Many Whites, however, have a strong interest in resolving the dissonance in favor of the myth. Far from needing to be on guard against racial [...] "threats or challenges", they would just as soon put the ugliness of racism out of mind. For them, the Horatio Alger myth provides them the opportunity to do just that".|$|R

40|$|There is {{conspicuous}} inequality among World Trade Organisation (WTO) member countries. WTO law {{has responded}} to this by creating {{a set of rules}} (Special and Differential Treatment or S&DT) which permit specially favorable trading treatment to support the participation of developing countries, even though equality of treatment is a central principle and objective of WTO law. Yet, it is widely agreed that S&DT has not succeeded in its aim of advancing trade equality. Insight into the reasons for this relative failure may be drawn from another body of international law which has equality as a core principle and objective and which also permits special treatment, human rights equality law. Analyzing commonly identified flaws in S&DT {{from the perspective of the}} theoretical, conceptual and strategic framework of human rights equality law enables the flaws to be <b>understood</b> more <b>deeply.</b> <b>It</b> also offers a new perspective on the impasse which has been reached in the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations and provides robust guidance as to how S&DT may be made stronger, more effective and more operational.
