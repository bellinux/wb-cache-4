5|$|A limited fauna {{is known}} from the <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> of the Oldman Formation, and Corythosaurus casuarius as well as C. intermedius are among the taxa. Also from {{the section of the}} {{formation}} are the theropods Daspletosaurus, and Saurornitholestes, the hadrosaurids Brachylophosaurus, Gryposaurus and Parasaurolophus, and the ankylosaurid Scolosaurus, and the ceratopsians Coronosaurus and Chasmosaurus. Other genera are known, but do not persist from the <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> of the formation, and therefore are not contemporaries of Corythosaurus.|$|E
5|$|State Route 133, locally called Laguna Canyon Road, {{winds through}} Laguna Canyon {{for the entire}} length of the gorge. California State Route 73 bisects the gorge east-west. The lower section of the canyon is part of the Laguna Coast Wilderness, while the <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> also has a few smaller {{wilderness}} preserves. The <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> contains the Laguna Lakes, a series of small natural lakes formed by groundwater rising along a local fault line, which are the namesake of the canyon. A section of the lower canyon within the city limits of Laguna Beach is heavily developed. The northernmost extreme of the canyon lies near a residential area that adjoins Interstate 405.|$|E
5|$|Work {{commenced}} {{again in}} 1933 {{and the line}} opened on 10 October 1934. At first the line was built with double track from Frøen to Østhorn and single track to Sognsvann. Between 1937 and 1939, the <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> was converted to double track. The construction spurred a massive residential construction along the line giving a good foundation for ridership.|$|E

5|$|As of September 2017, {{reconstruction}} of the damaged lower section of the spillway was about one-third complete, {{with the goal of}} making the spillway operational by November 1. In 2018, the <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> of the spillway which was undamaged by the flood but also has been identified as structurally defective, will be demolished and rebuilt. In addition, crews are working to extend a cutoff wall under the emergency spillway to prevent erosion should that structure be used again in the future.|$|E
5|$|Methods for {{measuring}} retreat include staking terminus location, global positioning mapping, aerial mapping and laser altimetry. The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning {{along the entire}} length of the glacier. This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the glacier no longer has a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive. For example, Easton Glacier in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most likely to fall into disequilibrium with the climate.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Western Canal was {{conceived}} {{as one of}} several competing schemes to alleviate the hazards and delays of coastal sailing ships making a passage around Land's End to get between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel. A canal {{from the mouth of}} the River Exe to Exeter had been opened in 1566; and eight miles of the River Tone had been made navigable in 1638. Navigation of the River Tone had been extended to Taunton in 1717, by the construction of locks on the <b>upper</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{first phase}} of the {{redevelopment}} involved the demolition of the North Stand, the concreting of all terraces and the building a block of turnstiles around the <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> of the East Terrace. This work, begun in October 1981 and completed in 1986, reduced the capacity to 74,370 and cost £3 million. A second phase had been planned to begin in 1988, but the release of the Taylor Report caused the plans to be redrawn and the proposed costs escalated to £25 million. Scotland hosted the 1989 FIFA Under-16 World Cup, with the Scots contesting the final against Saudi Arabia at Hampden.|$|E
5|$|The {{length and}} origin these eruptions has also varied. Events last {{anywhere}} between days and years, and occur {{at a number}} of different sites. Half of all eruptions occur at or near Kīlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century, and after a reprieve between 1894 and 1907, continued onwards until 1924. There have been five historical eruptions at the volcano's relatively southwestern rift zone, and 24 along its more active eastern rift zone, mostly along its <b>upper</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{prospectus}} {{was issued}} which contained a detailed {{breakdown of the}} likely costs, revenue and profits of such a scheme, and the promotors prepared to obtain an Act of Parliament. During this time, someone challenged the original survey and another local surveyor was asked to review it. John Beauchamp suggested that no locks would be required on the <b>upper</b> <b>section,</b> but that costs {{were likely to be}} £15,234. This was later raised to £18,000, and the Act of Parliament, which authorised the construction of a canal that followed Hammett's plans, was obtained on 28 May 1827. The proprietors were empowered to raise £18,000 by the issue of 360 shares of £50 each, with powers to raise another £5,000 by mortgage, or to borrow any part of the £18,000 from the Exchequer Bills Commissioners.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19th century the Glastonbury Canal {{drainage}} problems and competition from the new railways caused a decline in trade, and the town's economy became depressed. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and the lock and aqueducts on the <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854. The lower sections of the canal were given to the Commissioners for Sewers, for use as a drainage ditch. The final section was retained to provide a wharf for the railway company, which was used until 1936, when it passed to the Commissioners of Sewers and was filled in. The Central Somerset Railway merged with the Dorset Central Railway to become the Somerset and Dorset Railway. The main line to Glastonbury closed in 1966.|$|E
5|$|The Bourbon Spanish, meanwhile, were {{planning}} {{to carry out a}} surprise attack. Simón Susarte, a Spanish goatherd who had fled Gibraltar after its capture by Rooke a few months earlier, told Villadarias that there was a secret route by which {{the east side of the}} Rock of Gibraltar could be scaled. It required a climb of around , of which the <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> was near-vertical, but was passable with the use of rope and ladders via the Great Sand Dune. As the east side was considered virtually impregnable, only the west side was fortified; if the Rock could be climbed from the east, an attacker could evade the fortifications and descend directly into the town. The route was reconnoitred and found to be passable by a lightly armed force.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{improvements}} to the river were made between the 1540s and the 1570s, when Arundel became a port, and navigation up to Pallingham was improved, but barges had difficulty negotiating the flash locks that were installed. The work {{was carried out by}} Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel, who made the <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> toll-free. Harbour commissioners managed the lower river from Arundel to the sea from 1732, and major improvements to keep the estuary free from silt were sanctioned by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1793. With the coming of the railways and changes in coastal shipping, Littlehampton superseded Arundel as the port of the Arun, and the Littlehampton harbour commissioners are still responsible for the river up to Arundel, collecting tolls for its use.|$|E

The right-hand wing portrays scenes associated with the Last Judgement: a hellscape at its base, the resurrected awaiting judgement in the centre-ground, and a representation of Christ in Majesty flanked by a Great Deësis of saints, apostles, clergy, virgins and nobility in the <b>upper</b> <b>section.</b> Portions of the work contain Greek, Latin and Hebrew inscriptions. The original gilt frames contain Biblical passages in Latin drawn from the books of Isaiah, Deuteronomy and Revelation. According to a date written in Russian on their reverse, the panels were transferred to canvas supports in 1867.|$|E
5|$|There was {{friction}} between the new owners and the Commissioners of Sewers. The railway company proposed {{the creation of a}} railway between Highbridge and Glastonbury in 1850, and the Somerset Central Railway was authorised by Parliament on 17 June 1852. The canal was transferred to the new company, and was used to speed the construction of the railway, earning £312 in the year ending September 1853. The line followed the route of the canal closely, with much of it built on the towpath. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and the lock and aqueducts on the <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav {{remained}} well offshore, the difference in pressure between it and a high pressure area over the central United States caused strong winds in areas of New Jersey on September 11. Wind gusts ranged from 35–45mph (55–70km/h), with stronger winds reported near the coast. A maximum wind gust of 60mph (100km/h) was reported at Keansburg. The strong winds downed trees and power lines throughout {{the eastern half of}} the state, damaging homes and blocking streets. At least 14,000 homes in the vicinity of Burlington and Ocean Counties were left without power. In West Windsor Township, a man was killed when the <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> of a concrete wall he was working on blew over and crushed him. The other death occurred in West Amwell Township, where a tree limb fell on two elderly women, killing one and injuring the other. Elsewhere, while there were reports of trees falling on vehicles, no other serious injuries or deaths were reported.|$|E

5|$|Like {{a number}} of other delta-wing {{aircraft}} designed to cruise at very high speeds, the Valkyrie included a droop-nose that allowed the pilots to view the ground during the nose-high takeoff and landing. The Concorde or Tupolev Tu-144 both used a design where the entire nose section was angled downward, including outer window panels, exposing interior windows that were more vertically angled. In the B-70 design, only the <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> of the nose moved down into a fixed lower section, and the outer window panels moved with it to become more vertical, at 24degrees slope. With the nose raised into its high-speed position, the outer windows were almost horizontal. A system that blew 600F air from the engines was used for both defogging and rain removal. The lower forward section included a radar bay, and production machines were to be equipped with a refueling receptacle on the upper surface of the nose.|$|E
5|$|New, {{adjoining}} roads gradually {{began to}} appear, such as Lamesley Road, which later became Kells Lane, and Low Fell Road, which became Beaconsfield Road and Belle Vue Bank. In January 1841, local poet Thomas Wilson bought land on Durham Road and opened literary rooms which were opened in November 1841. The <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> {{of the literary}} rooms {{was used as a}} school for local children until the opening of a new school on a site at Kells Lane in 1895. In the 1880s there was a decade of intensive building and the population of the village increased accordingly. The relative tranquility of the village, coupled with scenic views of surrounding hills and countryside, attracted rich industrialists from nearby NewcastleuponTyne, seeking an alternative to the dirt and noise of industrial Newcastle and Gateshead. These individuals duly built and lived in mansion property in the area. One such property, Heathfield, was a mansion located on Durham Road which was built and owned by a wealthy chemical manufacturer who kept bears in his substantial adjoining grounds.|$|E
5|$|There are 26 {{species of}} native and {{introduced}} {{fish in the}} lower Central Valley portion of the river, including Sacramento sucker, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and carp. Anadromous fish species found in the lower river are chinook salmon, Pacific lamprey and striped bass. The <b>upper</b> <b>section</b> of the river, defined as the stretch from Lake McClure to the headwaters, has 11 species of fish. Historically, the range of anadromous fish extended to the waterfalls {{at the head of}} Yosemite Valley, but dams have blocked their migration since the early 1900s, and diversions frequently dewater their remaining spawning habitat in {{the lower part of the}} river. Environmental measures enacted in the late 20th century have had some success in boosting chinook salmon populations, from a record low of 500 fish during several years in the 1950s, to a high of 30,000 in 1984. Since the 1970s, the annual chinook run has averaged about 5,300.|$|E

The <b>upper</b> <b>sections</b> generally have thick [...] "beards" [...] that filter solid lumps out of their food, as spiders can take only liquid food. Scorpions' pedipalps generally form large claws for capturing prey, while those of spiders are fairly small appendages whose bases also act {{as an extension of}} the mouth; in addition, those of male spiders have enlarged last sections used for sperm transfer.|$|R
