5|$|The Cold War {{continues}} to influence world affairs. The post-Cold War world {{is considered to}} be <b>unipolar,</b> with the United States the sole remaining superpower. The Cold War defined the political role of the United States after World WarII—by 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries, with 526,000 troops stationed abroad, with 326,000 in Europe (two-thirds of which in west Germany) and 130,000 in Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea). The Cold War also marked the zenith of peacetime military–industrial complexes, especially in the United States, and large-scale military funding of science. These complexes, though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century, snowballed considerably during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebellar}} cortex {{is divided into}} three layers. At the bottom lies the thick granular layer, densely packed with granule cells, along with interneurons, mainly Golgi cells but also including Lugaro cells and <b>unipolar</b> brush cells. In the middle lies the Purkinje layer, a narrow zone that contains the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and Bergmann glial cells. At the top lies the molecular layer, which contains the flattened dendritic trees of Purkinje cells, along with the huge array of parallel fibers penetrating the Purkinje cell dendritic trees at right angles. This outermost layer of the {{cerebellar cortex}} also contains two types of inhibitory interneuron: stellate cells and basket cells. Both stellate and basket cells form GABAergic synapses onto Purkinje cell dendrites.|$|E
5|$|The main {{driver of}} Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} is the planet's rotation. In this respect Jupiter {{is similar to}} a device called a <b>Unipolar</b> generator. When Jupiter rotates, its ionosphere moves relatively to the dipole magnetic field of the planet. Because the dipole magnetic moment points {{in the direction of the}} rotation, the Lorentz force, which appears as a result of this motion, drives negatively charged electrons to the poles, while positively charged ions are pushed towards the equator. As a result, the poles become negatively charged and the regions closer to the equator become positively charged. Since the magnetosphere of Jupiter is filled with highly conductive plasma, the electrical circuit is closed through it. A current called the direct current flows along the magnetic field lines from the ionosphere to the equatorial plasma sheet. This current then flows radially away from the planet within the equatorial plasma sheet and finally returns to the planetary ionosphere from the outer reaches of the magnetosphere along the field lines connected to the poles. The currents that flow along the magnetic field lines are generally called field-aligned or Birkeland currents. The radial current interacts with the planetary magnetic field, and the resulting Lorentz force accelerates the magnetospheric plasma in the direction of planetary rotation. This is the main mechanism that maintains co-rotation of the plasma in Jupiter's magnetosphere.|$|E
25|$|The {{measurement}} of a voltage requires two contacts and so, electrically, the <b>unipolar</b> leads are measured {{from the common}} lead (negative) and the <b>unipolar</b> lead (positive).|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} on {{the effectiveness}} of ECT in <b>unipolar</b> and bipolar depression was conducted in 2012. Results indicated that although patients with <b>unipolar</b> depression and bipolar depression responded to other medical treatments very differently, both groups responded equally well to ECT. Overall remission rate for patients given a round of ECT treatment was 51.5% for those with <b>unipolar</b> depression and 50.9% for those with bipolar depression. The severity of each patient’s depression was assessed at the same baseline in each group.|$|E

25|$|A study {{looking at}} 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or <b>unipolar</b> depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in {{creative}} professions {{for those with}} bipolar disorder {{as well as for}} undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with <b>unipolar</b> depression or their relatives.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{problem with}} antidepressants {{is the chance}} of antidepressant-induced mania in patients with bipolar disorder. Many cases of bipolar depression {{are very similar to}} those of <b>unipolar</b> depression. Therefore, the patient can be misdiagnosed with <b>unipolar</b> depression and be given antidepressants. Studies have shown that antidepressant-induced mania can occur in 20–40% of bipolar patients. For bipolar depression, antidepressants (most frequently SSRIs) can exacerbate or trigger symptoms of hypomania and mania.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-20th century, {{researchers}} {{theorized that}} depression {{was caused by}} a chemical imbalance in neurotransmitters in the brain, a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of reserpine and isoniazid in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms. During the 1960s and 70s, manic-depression came to refer to just one type of mood disorder (now most commonly known as bipolar disorder) which was distinguished from (<b>unipolar)</b> depression. The terms <b>unipolar</b> and bipolar had been coined by German psychiatrist Karl Kleist.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 12 new-generation antidepressants showed that sertraline and escitalopram {{are the best}} in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of adults with <b>unipolar</b> MDD. Reboxetine was significantly worse.|$|E

25|$|The magnet is held {{to prevent}} it from rotating, while the disc is spun on its axis. The result is that the {{galvanometer}} registers a direct current. The apparatus therefore acts as a generator, variously called the Faraday generator, the Faraday disc, or the homopolar (or <b>unipolar)</b> generator.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{positive}} lightning flashes {{do not necessarily}} originate from the anvil or the upper positive charge region and strike a rain-free area outside of the thunderstorm. This belief {{is based on the}} outdated idea that lightning leaders are <b>unipolar</b> in nature and originating from their respective charge region.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 review about {{lamotrigine}} {{concluded that}} it is recommended in bipolar maintenance when depression is prominent and that {{more research is needed}} in regards to its role in the treatment of acute bipolar depression and <b>unipolar</b> depression. Furthermore, no information to recommend its use in other psychiatric disorders was found.|$|E
25|$|A bipolar {{junction}} transistor (bipolar transistor or BJT) {{is a type of}} transistor that uses both electron and hole charge carriers. In contrast, <b>unipolar</b> transistors, such as field-effect transistors, only use one kind of charge carrier. For their operation, BJTs use two junctions between two semiconductor types, n-type and p-type.|$|E
25|$|A {{clinical}} trial conducted at Harvard Medical School {{in the mid-1990s}} demonstrated {{that a majority of}} persons with non‑psychotic <b>unipolar</b> depression who were refractory to conventional antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy could be successfully treated with buprenorphine. Clinical depression is currently not an approved indication for the use of any opioid.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{aripiprazole}} {{was approved}} by the FDA for the treatment of <b>unipolar</b> depression when used adjunctively with an antidepressant medication. That same year, BMS settled a case with the U.S. government in which it paid $515 million; the case covered several drugs but the focus was on BMS's off-label marketing of aripiprazole for children and older people with dementia.|$|E
25|$|As the {{successor}} to a former superpower, Russia's geopolitical status has often been debated, particularly in relation to <b>unipolar</b> and multipolar views on the global political system. While Russia is commonly accepted {{to be a great}} power, in recent years it has been characterized by a number of world leaders, scholars, commentators and politicians as a currently reinstating or potential superpower.|$|E
25|$|Another study {{involving}} {{more than}} one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, <b>unipolar</b> depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers {{were also more likely to}} have bipolar disorder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unipolar</b> - One {{end of the}} {{secondary}} winding is connected to a single high voltage terminal, the other end is grounded. This type is used in modern coils designed for entertainment. The primary winding is located near the bottom, low potential end of {{the secondary}}, to minimize arcs between the windings. Since the ground (Earth) serves as the return path for the high voltage, streamer arcs from the terminal tend to jump to any nearby grounded object.|$|E
25|$|Biological {{psychiatry}} is {{a branch}} of psychiatry where the focus is chiefly on researching and understanding the biological basis of major mental disorders such as <b>unipolar</b> and bipolar affective (mood) disorders, schizophrenia and organic mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. This knowledge has been gained using imaging techniques, psychopharmacology, neuroimmunochemistry and so on. Discovering the detailed interplay between neurotransmitters and {{the understanding of the}} neurotransmitter fingerprint of psychiatric drugs such as clozapine has been a helpful result of the research.|$|E
25|$|The field-effect {{transistor}} (FET) is a transistor that uses an electric field {{to control the}} electrical behaviour of the device. FETs are also known as <b>unipolar</b> transistors since they involve single-carrier-type operation. Many different implementations of field effect transistors exist. Field effect transistors generally display very high input impedance at low frequencies. The conductivity between the drain and source terminals is controlled by an electric field in the device, which is generated by the voltage difference between {{the body and the}} gate of the device.|$|E
25|$|A {{round of}} ECT is {{effective}} for about 50% {{of people with}} treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, whether it is <b>unipolar</b> or bipolar. Follow-up treatment is still poorly studied, but about half of people who respond relapse within 12 months. Aside from effects in the brain, the general physical risks of ECT {{are similar to those}} of brief general anesthesia. Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and memory loss. ECT is considered one of the least harmful treatment options available for severely depressed pregnant women.|$|E
25|$|Particularly strong links {{have been}} {{identified}} between creativity and mood disorders, particularly manic-depressive disorder (a.k.a. bipolar disorder) and depressive disorder (a.k.a. <b>unipolar</b> disorder). In Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament, Kay Redfield Jamison summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in writers, poets, and artists. She also explores research that identifies mood disorders in such famous writers and artists as Ernest Hemingway (who shot himself after electroconvulsive treatment), Virginia Woolf (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer Robert Schumann (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed visual artist Michelangelo.|$|E
25|$|Although {{thyristors}} {{are heavily}} used in megawatt-scale rectification of AC to DC, in low- and medium-power (from few tens of watts to few tens of kilowatts) applications they have virtually {{been replaced by}} other devices with superior switching characteristics like Power MOSFETs or IGBTs. One major problem associated with SCRs {{is that they are}} not fully controllable switches. The GTO thyristor and IGCT are two devices related to the thyristor that address this problem. In high-frequency applications, thyristors are poor candidates due to long switching times arising from bipolar conduction. MOSFETs, on the other hand, have much faster switching capability because of their <b>unipolar</b> conduction (only majority carriers carry the current).|$|E
25|$|Prominent {{leaders of}} India's freedom {{movement}} had friendly {{relations with the}} United States of America which continued well after independence from Great Britain in 1947. In 1954, United States of America made Pakistan a Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) treaty-ally. India cultivated strategic and military relations with the Soviet Union to counter Pakistan–United States relations. In 1961, India became {{a founding member of}} the Non-Aligned Movement to avoid involvement in the Cold War power-play between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Nixon administration's support for Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 affected relations till the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. In the 1990s, Indian foreign policy adapted to the <b>unipolar</b> world and developed closer ties with the United States.|$|E
25|$|Differences {{lie in the}} {{presentation}} of megaloblastic anemia induced by either folate or B12 deficiency. Megaloblastic anemia related to deficiency in B12 generally results in peripheral neuropathy, whereas folate-related anemia often results in affective, or mood disorders. Neurological effects are not often associated with folate-related megaloblastic anemia, although demyelinating disorders may eventually present. In one study, mood disturbances were recorded {{for the majority of}} patients presenting with megaloblastic anemia in the absence of B12 deficiency. In addition, folate concentrations within blood plasma {{have been found to be}} lower in patients with both <b>unipolar</b> and bipolar depressive disorders when compared with control groups. In addition, depressive groups with low folate concentrations responded less well to standard antidepressant therapy than did those with normal levels within plasma. However, replication of these findings are less robust.|$|E

A long-term case series study by Kelly and Lieberman of 17 patients with major refractory <b>unipolar</b> depression found that 14 patients showed sustained improvement of symptoms over an average timespan of two years, in some cases with higher doses of T3 than the traditional 50µg required to achieve therapeutic effect, with an average of 80µg and a dosage span of 24 months; dose range: 25-150µg. The same authors published a retrospective study of 125 patients with the two most common categories of bipolar disorders II and NOS whose treatment had previously been resistant to an average of 14 other medications. They found that 84% experienced improvement and 33% experienced full remission over a period of an average of 20.3 (standard deviation of 9.7). None of the patients experienced hypomania while on T3.|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{is complex and}} does not lend itself easily to a linear narrative. Accounts of a schizophrenia-like syndrome {{are thought to be}} rare in historical records before the 19th century, although reports of irrational, unintelligible, or uncontrolled behavior were common. A detailed case report in 1797 concerning James Tilly Matthews, and accounts by Philippe Pinel published in 1809, are often regarded as the earliest cases of the illness in the medical and psychiatric literature. The Latinized term dementia praecox was first used by German alienist Heinrich Schule in 1886 and then in 1891 by Arnold Pick in a case report of a psychotic disorder (hebephrenia). In 1893 Emil Kraepelin borrowed the term from Schule and Pick and in 1899 introduced a broad new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between dementia praecox and mood disorder (termed manic depression and including both <b>unipolar</b> and bipolar depression). [...] Kraepelin believed that dementia praecox was probably caused by a long-term, smouldering systemic or [...] "whole body" [...] disease process that affected many organs and peripheral nerves in the body but which affected the brain after puberty in a final decisive cascade. [...] His use of the term [...] "praecox" [...] distinguished it from other forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease which typically occur later in life. It is sometimes argued that {{the use of the term}} démence précoce in 1852 by the French physician Bénédict Morel constitutes the medical discovery of schizophrenia. However, this account ignores the fact that there is little to connect Morel's descriptive use of the term and the independent development of the dementia praecox disease concept at the end of the nineteenth century.|$|E
