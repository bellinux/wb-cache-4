40|$|Using a questionnaire, we objectively {{assessed}} the body image ofdonors who underwent conventional laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (L-DN) or laparoscopic single-site donor nephrectomy (LESS-DN). Subjects were 15 patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> L-DN and 15 who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> LESS-DN. The questionnaire consisted ofthe Body Image Questionnaire (BIQ), including a Body Image Scale (BIS) and Cosmetic Scale (CS), and a Photo-Series Questionnaire (PSQ). A higher score indicated {{a more favorable}} assessment, and patient scores were compared. Subjects were also asked which procedure they preferred {{if they had to}} undergo donor nephrectomy again. Pain was assessed by comparing the number oftimes an analgesic was administered during hospitalization. The average BIS score was 18. 7 points (out of 20) for patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> L-DN and 19. 5 points for patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> LESS-DN; those who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> LESS-DN had a significantly higher score (p＝ 0. 03). Patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> L-DN had a median CS score of 17. 5 points (out of 24) while patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> LESS-DN had a median CS score of 19. 1 points; those who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> LESS-DN had a higher score, but the difference in average CS scores was not significant (p＝ 0. 123). The average PSQ score was 7. 1 points for patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> L-DN and 8. 8 points for patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> LESS-DN; the higher score for LESS-patients was statistically significant (p＝ 0. 01). Patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> L-DN were administered an analgesic a median of 4 times during hospitalization (range : 3 - 10 times) while patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> LESS-DN were administered an analgesic a median of 2 times (range : 0 - 4 times), which was significantly less (p＝ 0. 01). Patients who <b>underwent</b> LESS-DN had <b>a</b> better body image and better cosmetic appearance than those who underwent LDN, thus indicating the usefulness of LESS-DN. However, a more prospective larger study needs to be performed...|$|R
30|$|In Thyolo 898 {{patients}} <b>underwent</b> <b>a</b> {{surgical procedure}} in theatre. Analysis of the ERPC and caesarean section {{data showed that}} only 5 of the 332 patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> ERPC, and 271 of the 394 who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> emergency caesarean section, were admitted. Therefore the admission data does not capture many of the patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>a</b> procedure in theatre. If all patients who had <b>undergone</b> <b>a</b> procedure in theatre had been admitted, {{the total number of}} admissions would have been 6931 with 19.4  % of all hospital admissions being surgical and 18.5  % of all hospital patients requiring surgical input. With a population of approximately 600, 000, the major operation rate for Thyolo was therefore 299 per 100, 000 population per year.|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{investigated}} {{the impacts of}} a partial nephrectomy (PN) or radical nephrectomy (RN) on cardiovascular events and death. However, the association between the type of nephrectomy (PN vs. RN) and cardiovascular disease is still equivocal. This retrospective cohort study aimed to compare the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) between patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>a</b> PN and those who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> RN. We used data from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005. In total, 60 patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>a</b> PN and 545 patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> RN were included. Each patient was tracked for 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, and 5 -year periods to identify those who were subsequently diagnosed with CHD. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for CHD during 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, and 5 -year follow-up periods between these two cohorts. For the 1 -year follow-up period, the adjusted HR was 0. 39 (95 % CI: 0. 05 ~ 2. 90, p = 0. 355) for patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>a</b> PN {{compared to those who}} <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> RN. Additionally, the adjusted HRs of CHD in patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>a</b> PN for 2 -, 3 - and 5 -year follow-up periods were 1. 40 (95 % CI: 0. 62 ~ 3. 16, p = 0. 417), 1. 09 (95 % CI: 0. 52 ~ 2. 31, p = 0. 814), and 1. 02 (95 % CI: 0. 48 ~ 2. 18, p = 0. 961), respectively, compared to those who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> RN.

40|$|International audienceBoth auto-SCT {{and reduced}} {{intensity}} allo-SCT (RIST) {{are employed in}} the treatment of relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL). We have analysed the outcome of these two transplant procedures when used as a first transplant in this setting. We conducted a retrospective comparison of 726 patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> auto-SCT and 149 who <b>underwent</b> <b>a</b> RIST as a first transplant procedure for relapsed FL as reported to the Lymphoma Working Party of the European Bone Marrow Transplant. The non-relapse mortality (NRM) was significantly worse for patients <b>undergoing</b> <b>a</b> RIST (relative risk (RR) 4. 0, P< 0. 001). The 1 -year NRM was 15 % for those <b>undergoing</b> <b>a</b> RIST compared with 3 % for those <b>undergoing</b> <b>an</b> auto-SCT. Disease relapse or progression were significantly worse for those receiving an auto-SCT (RR 3. 1, P< 0. 001).
