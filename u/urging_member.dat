40|$|AbstractSchistosomiasis is a {{water-based}} {{parasitic disease}} that affects over 250 million people. Control efforts {{have long been}} in vain, {{which is one reason}} why schistosomiasis is considered a neglected tropical disease. However, since the new millennium, interventions against schistosomiasis are escalating. The initial impetus stems from a 2001 World Health Assembly resolution, <b>urging</b> <b>member</b> states to scale-up deworming of school-aged children with the anthelminthic drug praziquantel. Because praziquantel is safe, efficacious and inexpensive when delivered through the school platform, diagnosis before drug intervention was deemed unnecessary and not cost-effective. Hence, there was little interest in research and development of novel diagnostic tools. With the recent publication of the World Health Organization (WHO) Roadmap to overcome the impact of neglected tropical diseases in 2020, we have entered a new era. Elimination of schistosomiasis has become the buzzword and this has important ramifications for diagnostic tools. Indeed, measuring progress towards the WHO Roadmap and whether local elimination has been achieved requires highly accurate diagnostic assays. Here, we introduce target product profiles for diagnostic tools that are required for different stages of a schistosomiasis control programme. We provide an update of the latest developments in schistosomiasis diagnosis, including microscopic techniques, rapid diagnostic tests for antigen detection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and proxy markers for morbidity assessments. Particular emphasis is placed on challenges and solutions for new technologies to enter clinical practice...|$|E

40|$|Background: The 58 th World Health Assembly and 56 th WHO Regional Committee for Africa adopted resolutions <b>urging</b> <b>Member</b> States {{to ensure}} that health {{financing}} systems included a method for prepayment to foster financial risk sharing among the population and avoid catastrophic health-care expenditure. The Regional Committee asked countries to strengthen or develop comprehensive health financing policies. This paper presents {{the findings of a}} survey conducted among senior staff of selected Eritrean ministries and agencies to elicit views on some of the elements likely {{to be part of a}} national health financing policy. Methods: This is a descriptive study. A questionnaire was prepared and sent to 19 senior staff (Directors) in the Ministry of Health, Labour Department, Civil Service Administration, Eritrean Confederation of Workers, National Insurance Corporation of Eritrea and Ministry of Local Government. The respondents were selected by the Ministry of Health as key informants. Results: The key findings were as follows: the response rate was 84. 2 % (16 / 19); 37. 5 % (6 / 16) and 18. 8 % said that the vision of Eritrean National Health Financing Policy (NHFP) should include the phrases ‘equitable and accessible quality health services ’ and ‘improve efficiency or reduce waste ’ respectively; over 68 % indicated that NHFP should include securing adequate funding, ensuring efficiency, ensuring equitable financial access, protection from financial catastrophe, and ensuring provider payment mechanisms create positive incentives to service providers...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} {{to a better understanding}} of World Health Organization contribution to process of combating female genital mutilation in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The World Health Organization is well known all over the world for their work in public health. This organization is dealing with many issues concerning health and well being of people, the one of these issues is combating female genital mutilation. 		The practice of female circumcision/female genital mutilation is practiced in many countries in African as in Ethiopia. The variety of reasons, age of the girl circumcised and many other aspects make the process of combating of this practice challengeable. The one of the many strategies for combating female circumcision is legal prohibition of this practice. World Health Organization have contributed to this process by adopting resolutions <b>urging</b> <b>Member</b> states to establish national policies to end traditional practices that are harmful to the health of women and children. However, that the practice of female circumcision is recognized as violation of internationally adopted human rights, for some groups of people is this practice seen as part of their culture, tradition and norm of the behaviour. The focus of this thesis to find out what the World Health Organization does in combating female genital mutilation in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and what kind of experiences World Health Organization has in combating this practice. In addition, I am focusing on the World Health Organization’s cooperation with non-governmental organizations in the process of eliminating this practice...|$|E
40|$|Settings and Aim: The World Health Organization {{launched}} in 1999 an initiative {{to eliminate the}} global avoidable blindness and prevent the projected doubling of avoidable visual impairment between 1990 and 2020 (Vision 2020 : The Right to Sight). The World Health Assembly (WHA) adopted resolutions WHA 59. 25, WHA 56. 26 <b>urging</b> <b>member</b> states to adopt the Vision 2020 principles. More than 90 nongovernmental development organizations, agencies, and institutions, together {{with a number of}} major corporations, are now working together in this global partnership. Two neighboring states in North Western Nigeria provide eye care services using different approaches; one state uses the principles of Vision 2020, the other uses a different strategy. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess awareness and utilization of eye care services in two Nigerian states. Design: A population-based cross-sectional interview of households was conducted in two neighboring states using a structured questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 21 and a P < 0. 05 was considered as significant. Findings: Participation rate was 97 % in the two states. The population in the Vision 2020 -compliant state were significantly more aware about general eye care services (80 % vs. 44 %, P < 0. 0005); had less proportion of households unaware of any eye care service (55 % vs. 69 %, P < 0. 0005); and have a significantly higher felt the need to utilize eye care services (47 % vs. 5. 9 %, P < 0. 0005). The service utilization rate was however low in the two states. Conclusion: The principles of Vision 2020 : The Right to Sight is adaptable to different cultures/societies and has demonstrated a potential to increase awareness and a felt need for eye care in poor resource settings...|$|E

40|$|Protecting {{the poor}} and {{vulnerable}} against the cost of unforeseen ill health has become a global concern culminating in the 2005 World Health Assembly resolution <b>urging</b> <b>member</b> states to ensure financial protection to all citizens, especially children and women of reproductive age. Ghana provides financial protection to its citizens through the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). Launched in 2004, its proponents claim that the NHIS is a pro-poor financial commitment that implements the World Health Assembly resolution. Using 2011 survey data collected in seven districts in northern Ghana from 5469 women aged 15 to 49 the paper explores {{the extent to which}} poor child-bearing age mothers are covered by the NHIS in Ghana’s poorest and most remote region. Factors associated with enrolment into the NHIS are estimated with logistic regression models employing covariates for household relative socio-economic status (SES), location of residence and maternal educational attainment, marital status, age, religion and financial autonomy. Results from the analysis showed that 33. 9 percent of women in the lowest SES quintile compared to 58. 3 percent for those in the highest quintile were insured. About 60 percent of respondents were registered. However, only 40 percent had valid insurance cards indicating that over 20 percent of the registered respondents did not have insurance cards. Thus, a fifth of the respondents were women who were registered but unprotected from the burden of health care payments. Results show that the relatively well educated, prosperous, married and Christian respondents {{were more likely to be}} insured than other women. Conversely, women living in remote households that were relatively poor or where traditional religion was practised had lower odds of insurance coverage. The results suggest that the NHIS is yet to achieve its goal of addressing the need of the poor for insurance against health related financial risks. To ultimately attain adequate equitable financial protection for its citizens, achieve universal health coverage in health care financing, and fully implement the World Health Assembly resolution, Ghana must reform enrolment policies in ways that guarantee pre-payment for the most poor and vulnerable households...|$|E
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis {{that began in}} 2007 can be classified as a health system shock – that is, an unexpected occurrence originating outside the health system that has a large {{negative effect on the}} availability of health system resources or a large positive effect on the demand for health services. Economic shocks present policy-makers with three main challenges: • Health systems require predictable sources of revenue with which to plan investment, determine budgets and purchase goods and services. Sudden interruptions to public revenue streams can make it difficult to maintain necessary levels of health care. • Cuts to public spending on health made in response to an economic shock typically come at a time when health systems may require more, not fewer, resources – for example, to address the adverse health effects of unemployment. • Arbitrary cuts to essential services may further destabilize the health system if they erode financial protection, equitable access to care and the quality of care provided, increasing health and other costs in the longer term. In addition to introducing new inefficiencies, cuts across the board are unlikely to address existing inefficiencies, potentially exacerbating the fiscal constraint. In 2009, WHO’s Regional Committee for Europe adopted a resolution (EUR/RC 59 /R 3) <b>urging</b> <b>Member</b> States to ensure that their health systems would continue to protect and promote universal access to effective health services during a time of economic crisis. To date, there has been no systematic crosscountry analysis of health policy responses to the financial crisis in Europe, although some overviews of health system responses to the crisis have been published. This policy summary aims to address a gap in the literature by presenting a framework for analysing health policy responses to economic shocks; summarizing the results of a survey of health policy responses to the financial crisis in the European Region’s 53 Member States; and discussing the potential effects of these responses on health system performance...|$|E
40|$|Schistosomiasis {{is one of}} {{the major}} Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) in sub-Saharan Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa, two major human {{schistosome}} species namely Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium often occur sympatrically largely affecting children. Recognizing the public health impact of Schistosomiasis, the World Health Organization (WHO) is <b>urging</b> <b>member</b> states to regularly treat at least 75 % and up to 100 %, of all school-aged children at risk of morbidity. For control strategies based on targeted mass drug administration (MDA) to succeed it is essential to have a simple and sensitive test for monitoring the success of these interventions. Current available diagnostic tests, such as egg detection in stool by Kato-Katz (KK) for S. mansoni and detection of eggs or blood (hematuria) in urine for S. haematobium have reduced sensitivity in low intensity settings. The objective of the study was to evaluate active single or duo schistosome infections in school children following MDA using molecular diagnostics (PCR) on filtered urine samples and comparing that against traditional diagnostic tests. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 111 school children aged 7 - 15 years in Chongwe and Siavonga Districts in Zambia. Species-specific cell-free repeat DNA fragment were amplified from 111 filtered urine samples. Our approach detected eight times more positive cases (total 77) than by KK (9) for S. mansoni and six times more (total 72) than by hematuria (11) for S. haematobium and even more against urine filtration (77 compared to only 6). The same pattern was observed when stratified for age group and sex specific analysis with 100 % sensitivity and specificity devoid of any cross amplification. In addition, 69 individuals (62 %) were co-infected by both parasites. We have demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of both species than indicated by the traditional tests and the persistent maintenance of reservoir of infection after MDA. Our approach is an effective means of detecting low intensity infection, which will enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and assess the impact of MDA control programs against schistosomiasis...|$|E
