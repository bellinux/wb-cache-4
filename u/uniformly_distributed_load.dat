40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} is {{intended}} to report results of {{a study on the}} characteristics of the Safe-Domain of the rigid framed structure subjected to <b>uniformly</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>load,</b> continued from his paper, "A study on Safe-Domain, 1. " which was published on studies on the behavior of Safe-Domain of the rigid framed structure under concentrated load and its design method. The method for making up Safe-Domain of the structures under <b>uniformly</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>load</b> is fundamentally equal to that of the structures under concentrated load. The only difference is that-virtual work equation for collapse mechanism in which there are plastic hinges on the members directly subjected to <b>uniformly</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>load</b> represents a group of straight lines which included parameters ξ and η etc. denoting the positions of plastic hinges. The boundary line of Safe-Domain can get from group of straight lines, if ξ and η are so decided that they fulfil the condition of "Statically Admissible". A way to fulfil the above condition is as follows: After partially differentiating virtual work equation with respect to ξ and η, respectively, then we can get the values of ξ and η, and put these values into the original virtual work equation for collapse mechanism. And it is needed check other members. The demonstration of this method are given in this paper as a theoaem. And other theorems indicating the behavior of the Safe-Domain of the fa-emed structure subjected to <b>uniformly</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>load</b> are demonstrated also. These theorem are adaptable for any type of distributed load also...|$|E

40|$|A {{circular}} arch with in-plane radial <b>loads</b> <b>uniformly</b> <b>distributed</b> around the arch axis is primarily sub-jected to uniform compression. Under this action, the arch may suddenly deflect laterally and twist {{out of the}} plane of loading and fail in a flexural-torsional buckling mode. In most studies of the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of arches under uniform compression, the directions of the <b>uniformly</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>loads</b> are assumed to be unchanged and parallel to their initial directions during buckling. In practice, arches may be subjected to hydrostatic or to <b>uniformly</b> <b>distributed</b> directed radial <b>loads.</b> Hydrostatic loads always remain normal to the tangent of the deformed arch axis, while <b>uniformly</b> <b>distributed</b> directed radial <b>loads</b> always remain directed toward a specific point during buckling. These uniform radial loads may act at a load height, such as at the top surface of the cross-section. In this case, the radial loads produce an additional torsional moment during buckling which affects the flexural-torsional buckling of the arch. This paper uses both virtual work and static equilibrium approaches to study the elastic flexural-torsional buckling, effects of the load height on the buckling of {{circular arch}}es under uniform compression (that is, produced by <b>uniformly</b> <b>distributed</b> dead or by directed radial loads), and closed form solutions for the buckling loads are developed. 1...|$|R
