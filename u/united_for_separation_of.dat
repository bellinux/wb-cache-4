5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans <b>United</b> <b>for</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>of</b> Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century in the U.S., however, Decalogue monuments and plaques in government spaces had become a legal battleground between religious as well as political liberals and conservatives. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Americans <b>United</b> <b>for</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>of</b> Church and State launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and the American Jewish Congress), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider culture war between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the Liberty Counsel, have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the U.S. Supreme Court {{as a threat to the}} expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.|$|E
500|$|Legal battles {{concerning}} {{the separation of}} church and state originated in laws dating to 1938 which required religious instruction in school, or provided state funding for religious schools. The Catholic church was a leading proponent of such laws; and the primary opponents (the [...] "separationists") were the ACLU, Americans <b>United</b> <b>for</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>of</b> Church and State, and the American Jewish Congress. The ACLU led the challenge in the 1947 Everson v. Board of Education case, in which Justice Hugo Black wrote [...] "he First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state…. That wall must be kept high and impregnable." [...] It was not clear that the Bill of Rights forbid state governments from supporting religious education, and strong legal arguments were made by religious proponents, arguing that the Supreme Court should not act as a [...] "national school board", and that the Constitution did not govern social issues. However, the ACLU and other advocates of church/state separation persuaded the Court to declare such activities unconstitutional. Historian Samuel Walker writes that the ACLU's [...] "greatest impact on American life" [...] was its role in persuading the Supreme Court to [...] "constitutionalize" [...] so many public controversies.|$|E

40|$|In early June of 2006, an Iowa {{federal judge}} found a publicly-funded prison {{ministry}} {{to be in}} violation of the Establishment Clause and ordered it stopped. The program in question, the InnerChange Freedom Initiative, conceived and maintained by Prison Fellowship Ministries, utilized an overtly Christian model to rehabilitate inmates through spiritual and moral regeneration. In the eyes of the court, the failure of the state of Iowa to provide a reasonable secular alternative had the primary effect of advancing religion and fostered excessive governmental entanglement under a traditional Lemon analysis. Equally important in the court’s decision was the lack of conclusive evidence demonstrating a positive effect upon recidivism rates of InnerChange inmates compared with the rates of inmates within the general Iowa prison population. This comment addresses the seemingly endless problem of inmate recidivism in light of both studies evaluating the effectiveness of the InnerChange program, as well as more general solutions proposed under the Faith-Based Initiative. The fallout from Americans <b>United</b> <b>for</b> a <b>Separation</b> <b>of</b> Church and State v. Prison Fellowship Ministries, 432 F.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{centers on}} the origins and projects of the Baptist Joint Committee (BJC), founded and funded in 1936 by the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), and the Protestants and Other Americans <b>United</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Separation</b> <b>of</b> Church and State (POAU), founded in 1948 as the brainchild of Southern Baptist elites. I argue these organizations were primarily concerned with opposing American Catholic projects, especially those which sought public monies for parochial schools. Ironically, the structures and organizations which greatly aided this effort to expand religious tolerance and liberty in this period had their origins in concerns about the Catholic Church and American Catholicism held by many Baptists. A crisis point for the BJC and the POAU occurred when, in 1963, in the Schempp case, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that the devotional use of the Bible and prayer in public schools was unconstitutional. This decision was deeply unpopular with most evangelical politicians and lay people. Working against pressures and measures to amend the First Amendment “to put God back in the schools” in the post-Schempp U. S., evangelical elites of the BJC and POAU helped save it from emendation by vigorously, systematically, and publicly opposing the Becker Amendment and similar legislation. However, BJC and POAU support for Schempp and its de-Christianization {{of the public schools}} greatly alienated the broad evangelical support for these organizations. By the 1980 s, after the SBC was captured by its right wing, Southern Baptist support was effectively withdrawn from the BJC and the POAU, and these organizations lost their evangelical underpinnings. The BJC and the POAU reinvented themselves and subsequently worked to oppose those projects of the Religious Right they deemed contrary to the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> church and state—a Religious Right where, ironically, the SBC now played a large role...|$|R
