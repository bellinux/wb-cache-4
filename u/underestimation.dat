5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{before the storm}} struck. This was later determined to be because of missing atmospheric sounding data, {{as well as an}} incorrect assessment of the height of the tropopause, which led to an <b>underestimation</b> of the strength of the thunderstorm which produced the tornado. Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.|$|E
5|$|The gross <b>underestimation</b> of Fighter Command's {{strength}} {{issued to}} Luftwaffe units meant the British reaction was {{much stronger than}} expected. During the 24-hour period, Fighter Command flew 927 sorties, slightly fewer than the Germans. Only 41 of these sorties were flown by night, 28 on 17/18 August and 13 on 18/19 August. The remaining 886 sorties were flown by day, a number almost exactly equal to the 861 serviceable Spitfire, Hurricane, Defiant and Gladiator day fighters available to squadrons.|$|E
5|$|According to a Soviet General Staff report, 29 of the 35 major Luftwaffe {{raids on}} Soviet airfields in the Kursk sector in June 1943 were against dummy airfields. According to {{historian}} Antony Beevor, in contrast, Soviet aviation apparently succeeded in destroying more than 500 Luftwaffe aircraft on the ground. The Soviet deception efforts were {{so successful that}} German estimates issued in mid-June placed the total Soviet armoured strength at 1,500 tanks. The result {{was not only a}} vast <b>underestimation</b> of Soviet strength, but a misperception of Soviet strategic intentions.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the possible drawbacks of employing the standard Pearson estimator to measure correlation coefficients between financial {{stocks in the}} presence of non-stationary behavior, and we provide empirical evidence against the well-established common knowledge that using longer price time series provides better, more accurate, correlation estimates. Then, we {{investigate the}} possible consequences of instabilities in empirical correlation coefficient measurements on optimal portfolio selection. We rely on previously published works which provide a framework allowing to take into account possible risk <b>underestimations</b> due to the non-optimality of the portfolio weights being used in order to distinguish such non-optimality effects from risk <b>underestimations</b> genuinely due to non-stationarities. We interpret such results in terms of instabilities in some spectral properties of portfolio correlation matrices. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figures (revised version...|$|R

Louis decided to go first to Lille, and then crossed the border into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, staying in Ghent.

5|$|Armillaria luteobubalina {{was first}} {{described}} in 1978, {{after having been}} discovered several years earlier growing in a Eucalyptus plantation in southeastern Australia. It distinguished itself from other known Australian Armillaria species by its aggressive pathogenicity. It may take years for infected trees {{to show signs of}} disease, leading to an <b>underestimation</b> of disease prevalence. Studies show that the spread of disease in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps left following logging operations. Although several methods have been suggested to control the spread of disease, they are largely economically or environmentally unfeasible. Phylogenetic analyses have determined that A.luteobubalina is closely related to A.montagnei and that both of these species are in turn closely related to the Brazilian species A.paulensis. The distribution of A.luteobubalina suggests that it is an ancient species that originated before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} was {{the only}} unsuccessful operation undertaken by the HV since Operation Winter '94 in November 1994, and was brushed aside in Croatia as an aberration. It still remained a subject of controversy in the Croatian media. According to Croatian historian Davor Marijan, the operation was primarily politically motivated and hastily launched in response to Holbrooke's remarks of 17 September. Nonetheless, Marijan claims that the attack was based on incorrect intelligence, leading to an <b>underestimation</b> of the VRS defenses by the HV. In addition, the HV overestimated its own capacity to execute a difficult operation, and neglected {{the condition of the}} rivers that they intended to cross. The HV never attempted to repeat the crossing, instead choosing to threaten Banja Luka from a different direction in early October in Operation Southern Move.|$|E

5|$|At 13:59, Poling {{radar station}} {{picked up the}} German {{formations}} and reported them as 80 strong. Smaller forces ranging from 9 to 20-plus represented the German fighters moving up behind it. The British estimated the Luftwaffe attack force to be 150 aircraft strong. It was an <b>underestimation</b> by half. No. 10 Group RAF and No. 11 Group alerted their units from their operations rooms at Uxbridge and Box in Wiltshire. No. 10 and 11 Groups dispatched more Squadrons to support the already airborne 11 Hurricanes from No. 601 Squadron. 10 Group dispatched one Squadron each from RAF Middle Wallop, RAF Exeter and RAF Warmwell, and one each from No. 11's RAF Tangmere and RAF Westhampnett. The RAF order of battle included; nine Hurricanes of No. 43 Squadron RAF, led by Squadron Leader Frank Reginald Carey patrolling Thorney Island; No. 602 Squadron RAF protected Westhampnett with 12 Spitfires; No. 152 Squadron RAF and 11 Spitfires patrolled Portsmouth air space; No. 234 Squadron RAF with 11 Spitfires over the Isles of Wight to engage the attackers; No. 213 Squadron RAF with 12 Hurricanes which were to move 80 miles eastward from Exeter and patrol St. Catherine's Point. Finally, No. 609 Squadron RAF and 12 Spitfires remained in reserve around Middle Wallop to meet any unexpected German moves.|$|E

40|$|For certain {{surgical}} procedures (e. g. placement of implants), an accurate localisation of the mandibular canal {{is of utmost}} importance to avoid injuries to the neurovascular bundle. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate, on human fresh cadavers (n = 6), the accuracy of conventional spiral tomography for the localisation of the mandibular canal. By means of the Cranex TOME multifunctional unit (Orion Corporation Soredex, Helsinki, Finland), tomographic slices were taken at 3 different locations in the left posterior mandible (distal to the mental foramen). The mandibles were then sectioned at these 3 sites with a microtome. With a digital sliding caliper, the following 3 measurements were performed both on the tomograms and the bone sections at the three sites: 1) distance from the crest to mandibular canal, 2) overall bone height and 3) bone width. Overestimations of the distance to the mandibular canal (8 / 18) ranged from 1. 05 to 0. 10 mm and <b>underestimations</b> from 0. 30 to 1. 36 mm. The same number of over- and <b>underestimations</b> occurred for the bone height (1. 14 to 0. 14 mm and 0. 15 to 1. 40 mm, respectively). The bone width scored more overestimations (10 / 18), ranging from 1. 40 to 0. 12 mm, while <b>underestimations</b> ranged from 0. 25 to 1. 35 mm. From the present results, it is concluded that spiral tomography using the Cranex TOME multifunctional X-ray unit provides accurate information and sufficient detail for preoperative planning of implant placement in the posterior mandible. status: publishe...|$|R
