She recalled reading a book about sex education under the covers in her bedroom with a flashlight {{at the age of}} 12. Her mother found her and asked what she was doing. When she held <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> her mother allowed her to continue reading and told her to turn on the bedroom light so she could read properly and avoid damage to her eyes.|$|E
5|$|The Book of the Dead {{was part}} of a {{tradition}} of funerary texts which includes the earlier Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts, which were painted onto objects, not papyrus. Some of the spells included were drawn from these older works and date to the 3rd millennium BCE. Other spells were composed later in Egyptian history, dating to the Third Intermediate Period (11th to 7th centuries BCE). A number of the spells which made <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> continued to be inscribed on tomb walls and sarcophagi, as had always been the spells from which they originated. The Book of the Dead was placed in the coffin or burial chamber of the deceased.|$|E
25|$|The book is {{considered}} one of the gems of Jewish apocalyptic literature. Except for the Orthodox Slavonic Bible (Ostrog Bible, Elizabeth Bible, and later consequently Russian Synodal Bible), it was not received into European Christian canons. The chapters corresponding to 4 Ezra, i.e. 2 Esdras 3â€“14, make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> of II Izra, aka Izra Sutuel, canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church; it was also widely cited by early Fathers of the Church, particularly Ambrose of Milan. It may also be found in many larger English Bibles included as part of the Biblical Apocrypha, as they exist in the King James version, the Revised Standard Version, and the earliest editions of the Catholic Douay-Rheims Bible, among others.|$|E

25|$|At the monastery, the men {{find that}} all the monks {{have been killed by}} the plague, but locate the Key of Solomon, an ancient book filled with holy rituals used to defeat evil. The men confront Anna, and Debelzaq begins to perform a ritual used on witches. However, as Anna begins {{precisely}} recounting Behmen's past actions during the Crusades, Debelzaq realizes that she is not a witch, and begins frantically performing an exorcism. However, the demon that is possessing Anna reveals himself and melts the metal of the cage. He fights off the knights effortlessly, but when Debelzaq throws a vial of holy water on him, the demon flies out of sight. As the men search for the demon, they realize he is not trying to escape, but to destroy the book so that nothing can stop his powers. They find a room where the monks were writing copies of the book, where the demon, revealing himself to be Baal, destroys the copies and possesses the dead monks' bodies to use as weapons. The three men fight the possessed monks while Debelzaq continues the exorcism ritual. During the fight, Baal/Anna breaks Debelzaq's neck, then kills Felson. Kay picks <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> and continues the ritual, while Behmen continues fighting Baal/Anna. Behmen is mortally wounded during the fight, but Kay is able to finish the ritual and Baal is expelled from Anna's body, freeing her. Behmen asks Kay to keep Anna safe and then dies of his wounds.|$|E

500|$|The {{reviews for}} Thrilling Cities were broadly good. The critic for The Times thought that Fleming's style was [...] "no {{nonsense}} over fine writing", and summed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> as [...] "Fleming's smooth, sophisticated, personally conducted tours", {{noting that the}} author [...] "has a knack of enjoying himself". John Raymond, in The Sunday Times, wrote that [...] "Mr Fleming's prose arouses the voyeur that lurks {{in all but the}} best of us", and considered that the book remained [...] "supremely readable" [...] throughout. Writing for The Times Literary Supplement, Xan Fielding found {{the title of the book}} to be misleading, noting that apart from a very small win at the casinos of Las Vegas, [...] "his personal experience of thrills seems to have been just as limited everywhere else on his itinerary." [...] Fielding considered that the cities Fleming visited had the potential for thrills, and hoped that the material gathered was used in Fleming's literary works with thrills included.|$|E

Branden {{emphasizes the importance}} of moral values, stating that [...] "there is no way for a psychotherapist to keep his own moral convictions out of his professional work." [...] He does not view this as a flaw, but rather argues that the therapist should guide patients towards values that will improve their self-esteem. [...] "Effective psychotherapy requires a conscious, rational, scientific code of ethics", says Branden, and he identifies that code as the Objectivist ethics of Ayn Rand. He then briefly discusses five different therapeutic techniques and wraps <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> with a concluding section.|$|E

2500|$|Around {{the year}} 1000, {{butterfly}} binding was developed. Woodblock prints allowed two mirror images {{to be easily}} replicated on a single sheet. Thus two pages were printed on a sheet, which was then folded inwards. The sheets were then pasted together at the fold to make a codex with alternate openings of printed and blank pairs of pages. In the 14th century the folding was reversed outwards to give continuous printed pages, each backed by a blank hidden page. Later the sewn bindings were preferred rather than pasted bindings. Only relatively small volumes (...) were bound up, and several of these would be enclosed in a cover called a tao, with wooden boards at front and back, and loops and pegs to close <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> when not in use. For example, one complete Tripitaka had over 6,400 juan in 595 tao.|$|E

[...] He tries to convince the others logically that she didn't make it <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> <b>book</b> hints that he knows more of Narnia than he lets on. He is identified in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader as Professor Kirke, and appears as a young boy, Digory Kirke, a main character in the prequel, in which he witnesses Aslan's creation of Narnia. Although never explicitly stated, there are minor parallels between himself and Aslan on the smaller scale of the house in Dorset; in that he is rarely seen, can be sought for impartial wisdom, provides a sense of stability, and sometimes cannot be found.|$|E
2500|$|Herbert A. Giles wrote some 60 {{publications}} on Chinese {{culture and}} [...] language (see [...] ), {{which may be}} divided into four broad categories: reference works, language textbooks, translations, and miscellaneous writings (Aylmer 1997: 4). His pioneering reference books established new standards of accuracy. Of all his publications, Giles was most proud of (1892) A Chinese Biographical Dictionary and (1892, 1912) A Chinese-English Dictionary. Giles' textbooks for Chinese language learners include (1873) A Dictionary of Colloquial Idioms in the Mandarin Dialect and two Chinese phrasebooks transliterated phonetically according to the English alphabet, [...] "so that anyone could pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> and read off a simple sentence with {{a good chance of}} being understood": the (1872) Chinese without a Teacher and (1877) Handbook of the Swatow Dialect: With a Vocabulary for Teochew dialect (Aylmer 1997: 13). His wide-ranging translations cover many genres of Chinese literature. Probably the best known are (1880, 1916) Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio, (1884, 1922) Gems of Chinese Literature, and (1889, 1926) Chuang TzÅ­, Mystic, Moralist, and Social Reformer. Giles' other writings include some of the first general histories of China, the (1901) A History of Chinese Literature, (1906) Religions of Ancient China, and (1911) The Civilization of China.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{a seven-year}} period, Calvino wrote three realist novels, The White Schooner (1947â€“1949), Youth in Turin (1950â€“1951), and The Queen's Necklace (1952â€“54), but all were deemed defective. During the {{eighteen}} months {{it took to}} complete I giovani del Po (Youth in Turin), he made an important self-discovery: [...] "I began doing what came most naturally to me â€“ that is, following {{the memory of the}} things I had loved best since boyhood. Instead of making myself write the book I ought to write, the novel that was expected of me, I conjured <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> I myself would have liked to read, the sort by an unknown writer, from another age and another country, discovered in an attic." [...] The result was Il visconte dimezzato (1952; The Cloven Viscount) composed in 30 days between July and September 1951. The protagonist, a seventeenth century viscount sundered in two by a cannonball, incarnated Calvino's growing political doubts and the divisive turbulence of the Cold War. Skillfully interweaving elements of the fable and the fantasy genres, the allegorical novel launched him as a modern [...] "fabulist". In 1954, Giulio Einaudi commissioned his Fiabe Italiane (1956; Italian Folktales) {{on the basis of the}} question, [...] "Is there an Italian equivalent of the Brothers Grimm?" [...] For two years, Calvino collated tales found in 19th century collections across Italy then translated 200 of the finest from various dialects into Italian. [...] Key works he read at this time were Vladimir Propp's Morphology of the Folktale and Historical Roots of Russian Fairy Tales, stimulating his own ideas on the origin, shape and function of the story.|$|E

[...] However, unseen by Godvino, Briano has entered and observes Godvino's actions. He grows suspicious: [...] "a friend of Aroldo?", he wonders. [...] The guests flow into the room and Godvino is absorbed within the group. [...] They all express their joy at Aroldo's return. [...] Briano approaches Aroldo and explains what he has seen, pointing across the room to Enrico, Mina's cousin, as the one who planted the letter and who then picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>book.</b> [...] But he is amongst the group and is dressed {{in the same way as}} Godvino, so there is some confusion. [...] Suspicion falls on Enrico as Aroldo reveals that his honour has been betrayed. He tells of a similar situation in Palestine: Aria: Vi fu in Palestina / [...] "In Palestine there was once a certain man....", and confronts Mina, since he knows that she has a key to the book and [...] he believes that it too contains a secret letter. Mina's attempts to stall fail, and Aroldo breaks open the locked book and a letter drops from it to the floor. [...] Quickly stepping forward, Egberto picks it up stating that no one shall see it.
