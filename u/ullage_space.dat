25|$|Some {{degree of}} {{humidity}} is {{required in order to}} keep wines with cork enclosures from drying out. Even when wine bottles are stored on their sides, one side of the cork is still exposed to air. Should the cork begin to dry out, it can allow oxygen to enter the bottle, filling the <b>ullage</b> <b>space</b> and possibly causing the wine to spoil or oxidize. Excessive humidity can also pose the risk of damaging wine labels, which may hinder identification or hurt potential resale value. Wine experts such as Jancis Robinson note that 75% humidity is often cited as ideal but also that there is very little significant research to definitively establish an optimal range. Concern about humidity is one of the primary reasons why wine experts such as Tom Stevenson recommend that wine should not be kept in a refrigerator since the refrigeration process often includes dehumidifying, which can quickly dry out corks.|$|E
25|$|After {{fermentation}} {{the grapes}} are then aged in small oak barrels. In many DOC regions, the wines {{are required to}} age for at least 3 years {{though it is not}} uncommon for producers to age their wines for 5 to 10 years. Traditionally the barrels were made of chestnut instead of oak, which contributed high amounts of wood tannins and was very porous which promoted excessive evaporation in the barrel. Under this same traditional style of winemaking, a large ullage or air space would emerge in the barrel and oxidation took place. This gave the wine its characteristic amber but also flavours and traits that may be characterised as wine faults. Towards the end of the 20th century, more produces began switching to oak barrels while maintaining the tradition of not topping up the barrels and filling in the <b>ullage</b> <b>space.</b> This angel's share still produces some level of oxidation, though not as severe as the style was historically made. Modern winemaking technique also calls for more temperature control and keeping the wine in rooms with a consistent temperature that promotes more fresh flavours in the wine and fewer faults.|$|E
2500|$|Most wine racks are {{designed}} to allow a wine to be stored on its side. The thinking behind this orientation is that the cork {{is more likely to}} stay moist and not dry out if it is kept in constant contact with the wine. Some wineries package their wines upside down in the box for much the same reason. Research in the late 1990s suggested that the ideal orientation for wine bottles is at a slight angle, rather than completely horizontal. This allows the cork to maintain partial contact with the wine in order to stay damp but also keeps the air bubble formed by a wine's ullage at the top rather than {{in the middle of the}} bottle if the wine is lying on its side. Keeping the ullage near the top, it has been argued, allows for a slower and more gradual oxidation and maturation process. This is because the pressure of the air bubble that is the <b>ullage</b> <b>space</b> rises and falls depending on temperature fluctuation. When exposed to higher temperatures the bubble's pressure increases (becomes positive relative to the air outside of the bottle), and if the wine is tilted at an angle, this compressed gas will diffuse through the cork and not harm the wine. [...] When the temperature falls the process reverses. [...] If the wine is completely on its side then this action will eject some wine through the cork. Through this [...] "breathing" [...] which can result from variations in temperature, oxygen may be repeatedly introduced into the bottle and as a result, can react with the wine. [...] An appropriate and constant temperature is therefore preferred. Additionally, oxidation will occur more rapidly at higher temperatures and gases dissolve into liquids faster the lower the temperature.|$|E
25|$|Each {{propellant}} tank has a vent and relief valve at its forward end. This dual-function valve can be opened by {{ground support equipment}} for the vent function during prelaunch and can open during flight when the <b>ullage</b> (empty <b>space)</b> pressure of the liquid hydrogen tank reaches 38 psig (262 kPa) or the ullage pressure of the liquid oxygen tank reaches 25 psig (172 kPa).|$|R
40|$|A reduced {{dynamical}} model describing {{temperature stratification}} effects driven by natural convection in a liquid hydrogen cryogenic fuel tank has been developed. It accounts for cryogenic propellant loading, storage, and unloading in {{the conditions of}} normal, increased, and micro- gravity. The model involves multiple horizontal control volumes in both liquid and <b>ullage</b> <b>spaces.</b> Temperature and velocity boundary layers at the tank walls {{are taken into account}} by using correlation relations. Heat exchange involving the tank wall is considered by means of the lumped-parameter method. By employing basic conservation laws, the model takes into consideration the major multi-phase mass and energy exchange processes involved, such as condensation-evaporation of the hydrogen, as well as flows of hydrogen liquid and vapor in the presence of pressurizing helium gas. The model involves a liquid hydrogen feed line and a tank ullage vent valve for pressure control. The temperature stratification effects are investigated, including in the presence of vent valve oscillations. A simulation of temperature stratification effects in a generic cryogenic tank has been implemented in Matlab and results are presented for various tank conditions...|$|R
50|$|Also {{like some}} styles of Sherry, Vernaccia di Oristano is {{intentionally}} aged in oxidative conditions being stored in barrels {{that are only}} partially filled--leaving substantial <b>ullage</b> or head <b>space</b> for oxygen to {{come into contact with}} the wine. This can add some complexity to the wine and the presence of nutty, sherry-like aromas and a deep golden color, particularly for the sweeter dolce styles.|$|R
50|$|Vapor {{recovery}} {{is also used}} in the chemical process industry to remove and recover vapors from storage tanks. The vapors are usually either environmentally hazardous, or valuable to be recovered. The process consists of a closed venting system from the storage tank <b>ullage</b> <b>space</b> to a vapor recovery unit (VRU) which will recover the vapors for return to the process or destroy them, usually by oxidation.|$|E
50|$|The quad {{vehicle design}} is {{pressure-fed}} in blow down mode from an initial pressure of 320 psi for level 1 (400 psi level 2). The roll thrusters are cross-fed by gas drawn from <b>ullage</b> <b>space</b> {{of the opposite}} tank. The vehicle is able to transfer propellant through connecting pipes between opposite tanks by controlling ullage pressures with the thrusters; this helps it balance, minimizing gas use. The main engine has two-axis thrust vectoring. The vehicle is fully computer controlled; with guidance from GPS and fiber optic gyroscopes.|$|E
5000|$|The name œillade has two {{potential}} origins. The name {{could come}} from the French word ouiller that means [...] "to top up" [...] which can have a winemaking connotation of being a [...] "topping wine" [...] {{that is used to}} fill up wine barrels and other containers to remove <b>ullage</b> <b>space</b> that allows air to seep in and potential wine faults to develop. It could also be derived from the word œil which means eye and may be a viticultural reference to the fruiting bud of a grapevine.|$|E
50|$|An {{external}} {{floating roof}} tank is a storage tank {{commonly used to}} store large quantities of petroleum products such as crude oil or condensate. It comprises an open- topped cylindrical steel shell equipped with a roof that floats {{on the surface of}} the stored liquid. The roof rises and falls with the liquid level in the tank. As opposed to a fixed roof tank there is no vapor <b>space</b> (<b>ullage)</b> in the floating roof tank (except for very low liquid level situations). In principle, this eliminates breathing losses and greatly reduces the evaporative loss of the stored liquid. There is a rim seal system between the tank shell and roof to reduce rim evaporation.|$|R

Inserts were installed in the powder chamber to greatly reduce the <b>ullage</b> volume (empty <b>space)</b> in the chamber.

50|$|The {{design of}} the CRPU was {{extremely}} simple. The tubing was strong enough that the propellants were fed to the engine by pressure alone. This eliminated the need for turbopumps. The engine was ablatively cooled, {{eliminating the need for}} fine fuel passages and heat-resistant kerosene. The engine did not gimbal; instead, the vehicle was steered by throttling one side's CRPUs versus the opposite side. Thus, the engine was simply built into the tube walls, with the only mechanisms being the throttling valves. No separate pressurising system was included; the tanks were simply left with an <b>ullage</b> <b>space,</b> which was then filled with gas to a few hundred psi. Because of the narrow tubing, the bulkheads between sections could be simple plates, instead of domes like virtually all other rocket stages. There was no ignition system; instead, a slug of furfuryl alcohol was injected before the kerosene. The furfuryl alcohol ignited spontaneously upon contact with the nitric acid.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} to evaluate {{the performance of a}} propellant tank pressurization system with the pressurant diffuser intentionally submerged {{beneath the surface of the}} liquid. Propellant tanks and pressurization systems are typically designed with the diffuser positioned to apply pressurant gas directly into the tank <b>ullage</b> <b>space</b> when the liquid propellant is settled. Space vehicles, and potentially propellant depots, may need to conduct tank pressurization operations in microgravity environments where the exact location of the liquid relative to the diffuser is not well understood. If the diffuser is positioned to supply pressurant gas directly to the tank <b>ullage</b> <b>space</b> when the propellant is settled, then it may become partially or completely submerged when the liquid becomes unsettled in a microgravity environment. In such case, the pressurization system performance will be adversely affected requiring additional pressurant mass and longer pressurization times. This {{series of tests}} compares and evaluates pressurization system performance using the conventional method of supplying pressurant gas directly to the propellant tank ullage, and then supplying pressurant gas beneath the liquid surface. The pressurization tests were conducted on the Engineering Development Unit (EDU) located at Test Stand 300 at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). EDU is a ground based Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) test article supported by Glenn Research Center (GRC) and MSFC. A 150 ft 3 propellant tank was filled with liquid hydrogen (LH 2). The pressurization system used regulated ambient helium (GHe) as a pressurant, a variable position valve to maintain flow rate, and two identical independent pressurant diffusers. The ullage diffuser was located in the forward end of the tank and was completely exposed to the tank ullage. The submerged diffuser was located in the aft end of the tank and was completely submerged when the tank liquid level was 10 % or greater. The ullage diffuser tests were conducted as a baseline to evaluate the performance of the pressurization system, and the submerged diffuser tests showed how the performance of the pressurization system was compromised when the diffuser was submerged in LH 2.

40|$|Architectures for {{extended}} duration missions often include an on-orbit replenishment {{of the space}} vehicle's cryogenic liquid propellants. Such a replenishment could be accomplished via a tank-to-tank transfer from a dedicated tanker or a more permanent propellant depot storage tank. Minimizing the propellant loss associated with transfer line and receiver propellant tank thermal conditioning is essential for mass savings. A new methodology for conducting tank-to-tank transfer while minimizing such losses has been demonstrated. Charge-Hold-Vent is the traditional methodology for conducting a tank-to-tank propellant transfer. A small amount of cryogenic liquid is introduced to chill the transfer line and propellant tank. As the propellant absorbs heat and undergoes a phase change, the tank internal pressure increases. The tank is then vented to relieve pressure prior to another charge of cryogenic liquid being introduced. This cycle is repeated until the transfer lines and tank are sufficiently chilled and the replenishment of the propellant tank is complete. This method suffers inefficiencies due to multiple chill and vent cycles within the transfer lines and associated feed system components. Additionally, this system requires precise measuring of cryogenic fluid delivery for each transfer, multiple valve cycling events, and other complexities associated with cycled operations. To minimize propellant loss and greatly simplify on-orbit operations, an alternate methodology has been designed and demonstrated. The Vented Chill / No Vent Fill method is a simpler, constant flow approach in which the propellant tank and transfer lines are only chilled once. The receiver tank is continuously vented as cryogenic liquid chills the transfer lines, tank mass and <b>ullage</b> <b>space.</b> Once chilled sufficiently, the receiver tank valve is closed and the tank is completely filled. Interestingly, the vent valve can be closed prior to receiver tank components reaching liquid saturation temperature. An incomplete fill results if insufficient energy {{is removed from the}} tank's thermal mass and <b>ullage</b> <b>space.</b> The key to successfully conducting the no vent fill is to assure that sufficient energy is removed from the system prior to closing the receiver tank vent valve. This paper will provide a description of the transfer methodology and test article, and will provide a discussion of test results...|$|E
40|$|Void {{formation}} due to volumetric shrinkage and liquid/vapor reorientation during aluminum solidification {{was observed}} in real time by using a radiographic viewing system in normal and reduced gravity. An end-chill directional solidification furnace with water quench was designed and constructed to solidify aluminum samples during the approximately 16 sec of reduced gravity (+/- 0. 02 g) achieved by flying an aircraft through a parabolic trajectory. In the first series of tests the aluminum was contained in a vacuum sealed, pyrolytic boron nitride crucible. An <b>ullage</b> <b>space</b> was present during each test. Void formation was recorded for two cases: a nonwetting system, and a wetting system where wetting occurred between the aluminum and the crucible lid. The void formation in the nonwetting case was similar in normal and reduced gravity, with a single vapor cavity forming {{at the top of}} the crucible. In the wetting case during reduced gravity surface tension caused two voids to form in the top corners of the crucible, but during normal gravity only one large void formed across the top. In the second series of tests the aluminum was contained in a pyrolytic boron nitride crucible that was placed in a stainless steel container and sealed in an environment of argon plus 4 percent hydrogen. An <b>ullage</b> <b>space</b> was present during each test. Void formation was recorded for two cases: a nonwetting system, and a wetting system where wetting occurred between the aluminum and one side wall and the lid. The void for nation in the nonwetting case was similar in normal and reduced gravity, with a single vapor cavity forming {{at the top of the}} crucible, although the meniscus became more convex in reduced gravity. In the wetting case the aluminum did not climb up the corners in 1 g, and one large symmetric void resulted at the top when the aluminum had solidified.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model to predict boil-off of stored propellant in large spherical cryogenic tanks has been developed. Accurate prediction of tank boil-off rates for different thermal insulation systems was {{the goal of}} this collaboration effort. The Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program, integrating flow analysis and conjugate heat transfer for solving complex fluid system problems, was used to create the model. Calculation of tank boil-off rate requires simultaneous simulation of heat transfer processes among liquid propellant, vapor <b>ullage</b> <b>space,</b> and tank structure. The reference tank for the boil-off model was the 850, 000 gallon liquid hydrogen tank at Launch Complex 39 B (LC- 39 B) at Kennedy Space Center, which is under study for future infrastructure improvements to support the Constellation program. The methodology employed in the {{numerical model}} was validated using a sub-scale model and tank. Experimental test data from a 1 / 15 th scale version of the LC- 39 B tank using both liquid hydrogen and liquid nitrogen were used to anchor the analytical predictions of the sub-scale model. Favorable correlations between sub-scale model and experimental test data have provided confidence in full-scale tank boil-off predictions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental and theoretical analysis of crude oil under negative (sub-atmospheric) pressures. The use of negative pressure in the <b>ullage</b> <b>space</b> of tankers has been proposed for the mitigation of cargo losses resulting from accidental hull rupture. This potential application resulted in detailed laboratory tests of various crudes over a range of temperatures and pressures. The findings were then applied to prevent or minimize VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) emissions occurring during transport of crude oil. Equilibrium between liquid and gas/vapor components is reached at moderate hydrocarbon partial pressures. Predictions of liquid-vapor transformation can be made very accurately from known relationships, in the present case, the Peng-Robinson equation of state. The amount of material vaporized in reaching equilibrium is small, and the composition of the source liquid is changed only slightly. It can be shown that the partial pressures of hydrocarbon components are low, and can be accommodated by a closed system. The adverse environmental and economic losses caused by VOC emissions from crude oil tankers are significant. A brief discussion on the design of a closed, negative pressure system for VOC emission minimization is discussed. The closed loop system, along with a seawater heat exchanger, mitigates the effects of temperature and pressures as well and will significantly reduce VOC venting to the atmosphere.

40|$|The {{propellant}} tanks used {{in liquid}} rockets require pressurization gases {{in order to}} maintain tank pressure while the tanks are being drained during engine operation. The pressurization gas, which is typically much warmer than the relatively cold propellants in the tank, must be introduced into the empty <b>ullage</b> <b>space</b> {{at the top of the}} tank. The purpose of the diffuser is to control the flow of the gas into the tank in order to prevent direct impingement of the gas on the liquid surface and/or the tank walls. If the diffuser did not perform those tasks, the warm gas can create excess heat transfer causing an increase in the amount of pressurization mass required. Typical diffusers are long vertical cylinders that create a large exit area in order to minimize gas velocities. However, long vertical cylinders limit the amount of liquid that can be loaded into the tank in order not to have the liquid surface near the diffuser. A design goal for a pressurization diffuser is to create uniform flow in order to prevent jets that can impact the liquid surface and/or tank walls. The purpose of the task was to create a diffuser design that had a lower vertical profile (in order to be able to raise the liquid surface) while still maintaining uniform flow...|$|E
