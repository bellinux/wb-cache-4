40|$|In this paper, {{the design}} and {{development}} of an energy absorbing front underrun protection system with composite crash cones is described and the performance is demonstrated in a 70 kph full-scale car-to-truck frontal collision. The results are compared {{with the results of}} a test with identical vehicles, where the speed was 57 kph and the truck was fitted with a rigid front <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device.</b> Crash cones of composite material can successfully be used as energy absorbers in a structure used as an energy-absorbing truck front underrun protection system. It is demonstrated that the use of an energy-absorbing truck underrun protection system can result in significant improvements in occupant survivability. With a good design, even higher impact velocities than 75 kph may be feasible for modern cars using modern technology...|$|E
40|$|In 1993 the European Experimental Vehicles Committee (EEVC) {{has set up}} Working Group 14 {{to develop}} a test {{procedure}} for energy-absorbing front underrun protection systems (FUPS) for trucks. For this purpose the working group proposed a research programme, describing a stepwise approach to achieve this objective. This paper reports on the first results of the project dealing with accident investigation and results from car-to-truck frontal crash tests with a front <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> (FUPD) according to ECE Regulation No. 93. For the first time accident data of several European countries have been connected to give an overview about the accident scene in Europe with respect to car-to-truck frontal collisions. A representative accident type {{is defined as a}} basis for crash testing. Car-to-truck frontal crash tests with a FUPD according to the ECE Regulation are described and the results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Frontal {{collisions}} between {{passenger cars}} and trucks are the most severe vehicle-vehicle collisions observed in accident statistics. Regulation 93 was developed {{to reduce the risk}} of fatal injury through by preventing passenger cars from underriding heavy truck structures. Although this countermeasure can improve the interaction between the vehicles, the regulation does not fully address the higher energy of content in these collisions where passenger car structures cannot be expected to have sufficient energy absorbing capacity. One solution to problem is to incorporate energy absorbing structures into the Front <b>Underrun</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Device</b> (e. a. FUPD). The performance of such device under crash with a passenger car has to be investigated. This report shows the results obtained by simulations based on finite element method where the performance of the FUPD has been investigated through variation of the size of the FUPD front cross-beam surface, and its vertical and horizontal overlap with front end of a passenger car...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to investigate the possibilities to assess (energy-absorbing) front <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> (FUP) <b>devices</b> with respect to injuries of the car occupant without using a car and dummy in the test procedure. A large number of different crash configurations are simulated to search for a clear relationship between injury and vehicle criteria. Secondly, a representative structure that can replace a car was found. The simulation results show a correlation between injury levels given by the HARM and the accident severity given by the ASI value. Furthermore, the simulation results show that energy absorption in the FUP lowers the ASI level for all crash scenarios, which consequently results in lower injury levels. The main conclusion is that it is possible to assess the eaFUP performance on the basis of vehicle acceleration signals (non-dummy signals). A component test procedure for assessing eaFUP can be developed on the basis of these simulation results. For a future test procedure, a combination of experimental and virtual testing is proposed. With virtual testing, the behaviour of the eaFUP in different crash scenarios can be evaluated...|$|R

40|$|EEVC Working Group 14 is {{investigating}} the effect of fixing energy absorbing front underrun protection systems (eaFUPS) to trucks instead of rigid devices {{in order to reduce}} the injury severity to car occupants in car-to-truck frontal collisions. Three car-to-truck crash tests with cars from different mass groups at a speed of 75 kph are carried out. The results are compared with the results from identical tests carried out earlier with cars at a speed of 56 kph running into a truck with a rigid front <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device.</b> It appears that the deceleration pulses of identical cars in the different tests show almost identical shapes and peak levels. Having almost identical deceleration pulses, identical injury results for the car occupants would have been expected. However, the injury results are not all directly comparable. The deviating signals can be explained. Based on the results of the tests it can be concluded that the positive effect of an eaFUP is not unambiguously proven yet...|$|E
40|$|The {{aggressivity}} {{of trucks}} to other road users in daily traffic is widely known. The incompatibility is the origin mostly of serious and fatal injuries. Much harm can be anticipated by preventing for underride. Most serious and fatal injuries is inflicted to occupants of passenger cars in frontal collisions with trucks. An <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> helps {{to address the}} energy absorbing structure of the passenger car and thus reduces excessive deformation of the occupant compartment. Research on front underrun protection (FUP) for trucks by means of full scale testing, and especially on energy absorbing systems, is extensive and time consuming. Therefore simulation tools are applied in the early stage of the design process {{in order to obtain}} the basic parameters for later testing. In this presentation it is shown how MADYMO was used with combined multibody/finite element models of a truck with different types of FUP and a car in order to evaluate different FUP systems in car-to-truck frontal collisions...|$|E
40|$|Freno AB in Piteå has {{developed}} a tractor with a semi-trailer based on a Volkswagen Crafter chassis. The modifications of the vehicle that are included in this thesis work covers the parking brake system of the semitrailer, the rear <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> of the tractor and the maneuvering of the trailer’s service brake. The manufacturer of the tractor requests an independent analysis of whether these modifications have negative influences on the vehicle. A description of the parking brake system was made and its function was analyzed using force and torque equilibrium. The parking brake of the semi-trailer is maneuvered by an electric signal from the switch controlling the parking brake indicator on the dash board. The results were compared with regulations applicable by {{the date of the}} vehicle’s service entry. In theory, the parking brake meets the legal requirement to keep the vehicle stationary in a hill with 16 % slope and the design requirement of 18 %. Regulations regarding the rear underrun protection were studied and the company’s contact person was interviewed about the modification’s procedure. The <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> has been moved forwards due to the shortening of the rear overhang. No modification has been made to the device itself that can affect its strength. According to EU Directive 70 / 221 /EC, rear underrun protection is not necessary for this vehicle type. For the maneuvering system of the semi-trailer’s service brakes, the designer was interviewed and a system description was formulated. The trailer’s service brakes are maneuvered by a directional valve connected to the tractor’s brake circuits. This valve is the only interface between the tractor and the semitrailer brake circuits. The maximum consumption of brake fluid caused by the directional valve is 0. 3 cm 3. A test method was produced to determine if pressure variations caused by the semi-trailer’s ABS system can be measured in the tractors brake circuits. The measurements are to be implemented with a pressure sensor connected to the master brake cylinder and a data logger which measures the brake pressure during a braking operation. Based on the recorded data the process can be analyzed. The test methodology was inspired by the test made to the vehicle by the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) according to Directive 71 / 320 /EC.

40|$|Truck {{accidents}} {{represent a}} significant factor in the overall road accident scene, namely 25 to 30 % of the fatal accidents in the EU. Collision partners of trucks are mainly passenger cars in car-to-truck frontal collisions. The severity of this kind of accidents is due to the incompatibility of both vehicles. Today's passenger cars are built in a way that occupants stand a high chance of surviving a frontal impact to 56 kph. A truck fit with a rigid Front <b>Underrun</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Device</b> would supply compatibility, which will reduce the number of 4200 fatalities under the car occupants yearly with 900. However, the average relative speed in car-to-truck frontal collisions is approximately 75 kph. To protect cars at these speeds it is essential that the truck bumper absorbs part of the crash energy. If trucks were equipped with an energy-absorbing Front Underrun Protection System, at least 300 car occupants more would not be killed. This paper describes a combined approach of full-scale crash tests and numerical simulations to predict the effects of rigid and energy absorbing front underrun protection of trucks. The reduction of injuries to driver and passenger was verified in a crash test where the truck absorbed part of the impact energy. The activities were carried out by a consortium of research institutes and truck manufacturers, in the framework of the European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee (EEVC) Working Group 14 activities...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Since we {{reported}} about a landmark technique to reopen an occluded subclavian artery, we have faced difficulty in using <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> in the vertebral artery {{to protect against}} thromboembolism from the reversed steal phenomenon after angioplasty and stenting. Therefore, we are presenting an optimal solution in using a <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> while recanalizing the occluded subclavian artery. Materials and Methods: Among 21 cases of stenting for subclavian artery steno-occlusion, we applied the landmark technique {{at the opposite end}} of an occluded segment in 4 patients and used a <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> in two patients. Because the embolic <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> was placed in the vertebral artery via the brachial artery, optimal angioplasty and stenting via the brachial route were limited. Therefore, angioplasty via the trans-brachial approach was needed to be followed by stenting through a trans-femoral approach. We estimated the safe and optimal steps for placement and retrieval of the <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> in addition to stenting. Results: The procedure was safely performed when a stent was introduced via the femoral artery and a <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> was used via the brachial artery.
