60|$|Dermot {{explained}} {{that he had been}} bargaining for the skin, and hoped Mr. Alison would accept it from him, but here Harold's resolution won the day, much as Dermot evidently longed to lay the trophy at his feet. Poor Dermot, I could see hero-worship growing in his eyes, as they talked about horses, endlessly as men can and do talk of them, and diligent inquiries elicited from Harold what things he had done with the <b>unbroken</b> <b>animal</b> in Australia.|$|E
50|$|Training and learning: The size of {{the flight}} zone can depend upon the tameness or level of {{habituation}} of the animal. Completely tame animals have no flight zone for humans; that is, they will allow a person to approach and touch them. Wild, feral, and <b>unbroken</b> <b>animals</b> can have very large flight zones.|$|R
6000|$|I {{had opened}} the volume with some {{expectation}} of a revelation, though of what nature I could not imagine. The first page was disappointing, however, as it contained nothing but {{the picture of a}} very fat man in a pea-jacket, with the legend, [...] "Jimmy Colver on the Mail-boat," [...] written beneath it. There followed several pages which were filled with small sketches of Indians and their ways. Then came a picture of a cheerful and corpulent ecclesiastic in a shovel hat, sitting opposite a very thin European, and the inscription: [...] "Lunch with Fra Cristofero at Rosario." [...] Studies of women and babies accounted for several more pages, and then there was an <b>unbroken</b> series of <b>animal</b> drawings with such explanations as [...] "Manatee upon Sandbank," [...] "Turtles and Their Eggs," [...] "Black Ajouti under a Miriti Palm"--the matter disclosing some sort of pig-like animal; and finally came a double page of studies of long-snouted and very unpleasant saurians. I could make nothing of it, and said so to the Professor.|$|R
