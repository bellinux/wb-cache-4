5|$|Blassingame {{asserts that}} slave parents {{attempted}} to shield infants {{and young children}} from the brutality of the plantation.

5|$|In the Diet, {{the group}} of middle-sized states, known as Mittelstaaten (Bavaria, Württemberg, the grand duchies of Baden and Hesse, and the duchies of Saxony–Weimar, Saxony–Meiningen, Saxony–Coburg, and Nassau), {{supported}} complete demobilization within the Confederation. These individual governments rejected the potent combination of enticing promises and subtle (or outright) threats Bismarck {{used to try to}} gain their support against the Habsburgs. The Prussian war cabinet <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> its only supporters among the German states against the Habsburgs were two small principalities bordering on Brandenburg that had little military strength or political clout: the Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. They also <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> Prussia's only ally abroad was Italy.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> his {{military}} decisions {{would be more}} effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.|$|E

5|$|Castelli <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> the British force only {{aspired to}} annex {{the city to}} the British Empire, and {{resigned}} to avoid swearing allegiance to Britain. Santiago de Liniers liberated Buenos Aires a short time later, but Saturnino Rodríguez Peña helped Beresford escape, hoping to influence an eventual second invasion to implement reforms supported by Burke and Miranda. The second British invasion, however, ended the patriot's hopes of British support, and they fought against their former allies.|$|E
5|$|Commanders in the Tang army were {{familiar}} with the political culture of nomadic empires. Nomadic alliances were formed through distributing war plunder and ensuring the security of tribal property, and grew tenuous when rulers failed to deliver their promises. The Chinese <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> disaffected tribes were vulnerable to switching allegiances, and used this to their advantage.|$|E
5|$|During Michigan's in-home visit, Howard's {{grandmother}} treated Michigan {{head coach}} Fisher, his assistants Mike Boyd and Brian Dutcher, Vocational coach Cook, Vocational assistant coach Donnie Kirskey, Lois Howard (Howard's aunt) and Howard to a soul food dinner. Dutcher had {{the responsibility to}} contact Howard several times a week. Howard grew close to assistant coach Kirskey, often staying at his house and using his car once he got a driver's license. During the summer 1990 30-day visitation period, Dutcher watched Howard practice 28 consecutive days. Dutcher developed {{an understanding of the}} dynamics of Howard's relationship with his grandmother. While other coaches, such as Lute Olsen, almost ignored her during the recruiting, Dutcher <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> she was the key influence on his life, and <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> Kirskey also had sway with Howard. He encouraged Fisher to hire Kirskey for a summer basketball camp that, which became the young athlete's introduction to Ann Arbor, Michigan.|$|E

5|$|For many at the indaba, {{the most}} {{pressing}} motivator was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, he <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> Britain was more prominent on the world stage, and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he would keep his land, and the British would be obliged {{to protect him from}} incursions by the Boers.|$|E
5|$|His grave bears a one-word epitaph: Undefeated. It is <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> {{after the}} war, Hans-Joachim Marseille's remains were brought from Derna and reinterred in the {{memorial}} gardens at Tobruk; {{it was there}} that his mother visited his grave in 1954. His remains are now in a small clay coffin (sarcophagus) bearing the number 4133.|$|E
5|$|If the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of uranium was poorly <b>understood,</b> <b>that</b> of plutonium was practically unknown, {{as it had}} only existed in microscopic amounts. Samples began arriving from the reactors in 1943, and although the locus of the Manhattan Project's investigations into plutonium chemistry was at the Metallurgical Laboratory, the Ames Project investigated methods of separating plutonium metal from uranium and fission products.|$|E

5|$|In October 2001 Adams left Brighton {{to become}} {{assistant}} manager to Dave Bassett at Leicester City. Peter Taylor, the former Leicester manager, was drafted in to complete Brighton's promotion campaign. Adams chose the move {{in an attempt}} to get closer to his dream of managing a Premiership club. He <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> Bassett was to move 'upstairs' {{at the end of the}} season, leaving Adams free to take the management job for 2002–03.|$|E
5|$|Later, the cytological {{basis of}} the gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} extended from about 1900–1944 and was initiated by the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's (1822–1884) laws of plant heredity first published in 1866 in Experiments on Plant Hybridization and based on cultivated pea, Pisum sativum: this heralded the opening up of plant genetics. The cytological basis for gene-chromosome theory was explored through the role of polyploidy and hybridization in speciation and it was becoming better <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> interbreeding populations were the unit of adaptive change in biology.|$|E
5|$|Some {{historians have}} argued that the Ford {{administration}} felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot. But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national security team <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.|$|E

5|$|The French {{were more}} {{successful}} in persuading large landowners to cease support for the rebels and recruit local militias to protect highways from rebel attacks. The French also ultimately <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> in order to quell the revolt in Syria they needed to offer concessions in Anatolia and establish cooperation with the Turks, whose financial, military and moral support was critical to the rebels. When truces were reached with the Turks, the French redeployed large numbers of troops from the Anatolian front to suppress the rebels in Syria.|$|E
5|$|The {{conclave}} remained deadlocked {{until the}} electors were informed of Charles II's death in November. The electors present <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> with Charles' death, the next pope {{would need to}} be politically impartial, so a member of the zelanti was preferred. Giovanni Albani, who had drafted the bull outlawing nepotism, soon became the leading candidate for the papacy.|$|E
5|$|The second Persian {{invasion}} of Greece was {{an event of}} major significance in European history. A large number of historians hold that, had Greece been conquered, the Ancient Greek culture {{that lies at the}} basis of Western civilization would have never developed (and by extension Western civilization itself).
