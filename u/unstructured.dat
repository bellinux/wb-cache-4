5|$|The {{data are}} {{collected}} {{through a combination}} of direct and indirect means: <b>unstructured</b> observation while obtaining the biographical and social information, focused questions about current symptoms, and formalised psychological tests.|$|E
5|$|For live shows, The White Stripes {{were known}} for Jack's {{employment}} of heavy distortion, {{as well as}} audio feedback and overdrive. The duo performed considerably more recklessly and <b>unstructured</b> live, never preparing set lists for their shows, believing that planning too closely would ruin the spontaneity of their performances.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} (in Eucaryota ~33%) contain large <b>unstructured</b> but biologically functional segments and can {{be classified}} as intrinsically disordered proteins. Predicting and analysing protein disorder is, therefore, {{an important part of}} protein structure characterisation.|$|E
5|$|This {{section of}} the MSE covers the patient's level of alertness, orientation, attention, memory, {{visuospatial}} functioning, language functions and executive functions. Unlike other sections of the MSE, use is made of structured tests in addition to <b>unstructured</b> observation.|$|E
5|$|Watson uses IBM's DeepQA {{software}} and the Apache UIMA (<b>Unstructured</b> Information Management Architecture) framework. The system {{was written in}} various languages, including Java, C++, and Prolog, and runs on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 operating system using the Apache Hadoop framework to provide distributed computing.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in England, {{where the}} {{nucleated}} village existed relatively early, {{most of the}} early modern population of Scotland, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small clachans or townships and isolated dwellings. These were <b>unstructured</b> groups of houses, often belonging to between four and six tenants, who were often engaged in common agriculture. As the population expanded, some of these settlements were subdivided to create new clachans and more marginal land was settled, with sheilings (clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing) becoming permanent settlements.|$|E
5|$|Although most proteasomal {{substrates}} must be ubiquitinated {{before being}} degraded, {{there are some}} exceptions to this general rule, especially when the proteasome plays a normal role in the post-translational processing of the protein. The proteasomal activation of NF-κB by processing p105 into p50 via internal proteolysis is one major example. Some proteins that are hypothesized to be unstable due to intrinsically <b>unstructured</b> regions, are degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner. The most well-known example of a ubiquitin-independent proteasome substrate is the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. Ubiquitin-independent mechanisms targeting key cell cycle regulators such as p53 have also been reported, although p53 is also subject to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Finally, structurally abnormal, misfolded, or highly oxidized proteins are also subject to ubiquitin-independent and 19S-independent degradation under conditions of cellular stress.|$|E
5|$|In a loose, <b>unstructured</b> modernist {{narrative}} {{style that}} draws from Christian allegory and oral storytelling, Faulkner explores themes of race, sex, class and {{religion in the}} American South. By focusing on characters that are misfits, outcasts, or are otherwise marginalized in their community, he portrays the clash of alienated individuals against a Puritanical, prejudiced rural society. Early reception of the novel was mixed, with some reviewers critical of Faulkner's style and subject matter. However, over time, the novel {{has come to be}} {{considered one of the most}} important literary works by Faulkner and one of the best English-language novels of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|UIMA: The UIMA (<b>Unstructured</b> Information Management Architecture) is a {{component}} framework for analyzing <b>unstructured</b> content such as text, {{audio and video}} – originally developed by IBM.|$|E
25|$|An {{aggregation}} of fish is {{the general}} term for any collection of fish that have gathered together in some locality. Fish aggregations can be structured or <b>unstructured.</b> An <b>unstructured</b> aggregation might be a group of mixed species and sizes that have gathered randomly near some local resource, such as food or nesting sites.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} to improving classical machine learning with quantum information processing uses amplitude amplification methods based on Grover's search algorithm, {{which has been}} shown to solve <b>unstructured</b> search problems with a quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms. These quantum routines can be employed for learning algorithms that translate into an <b>unstructured</b> search task, as can be done, for instance, {{in the case of the}} k-medians and the k-nearest neighbors algorithms. Another application is a quadratic speedup in the training of perceptron.|$|E
25|$|IF..GOTO. A form {{found in}} <b>unstructured</b> languages, {{mimicking}} a typical machine code instruction, would jump to (GOTO) a label or line number when the condition was met.|$|E
25|$|Like the <b>unstructured</b> if, {{only one}} {{statement}} {{can be specified}} so in many cases a GOTO is needed to decide where flow of control should resume.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{automation}} is {{an emerging}} genus of automation enabled by cognitive computing. Its primary {{concern is the}} automation of clerical tasks and workflows that consist of structuring <b>unstructured</b> data.|$|E
25|$|All other {{approaches}} to homeschooling are subsumed under two basic categories: structured and <b>unstructured</b> homeschooling. Structured homeschooling includes any method or style of home education that follows a basic curriculum with articulated goals and outcomes. This style attempts {{to imitate the}} structure of the traditional school setting while personalizing the curriculum. <b>Unstructured</b> homeschooling is any form of home education where parents do not construct a curriculum at all. Unschooling, as it is known, attempts to teach through the child's daily experiences and focuses more on self-directed learning by the child, free of textbooks, teachers, and any formal assessment of success or failure.|$|E
25|$|Legislation in 1839 {{allowed for}} more than one grammar school in a district, {{triggering}} a rapid but <b>unstructured</b> growth in numbers over the following two decades, rising to 86 in 1861.|$|E
25|$|The volume {{occupied}} by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (the mesh). The mesh may be uniform or non-uniform, structured or <b>unstructured,</b> consisting {{of a combination of}} hexahedral, tetrahedral, prismatic, pyramidal or polyhedral elements.|$|E
25|$|The first theory {{attributed}} to de Kruif and Holt, proposes that nanoclusters of calcium phosphate and the phosphopeptide fraction of beta-casein are the centerpiece to micellular structure. Specifically in this view, <b>unstructured</b> proteins organize around the calcium phosphate {{giving rise to}} their structure and thus no specific structure is formed.|$|E
25|$|NextForm is a data {{migration}} spin-off from CoSort functionality designed to convert between structured file formats such as CSV, ISAM, LDIF, and XML, plus data types such as ASCII, EBCDIC, Unicode, and Packed Decimal. Newer NextForm editions can structure data in <b>unstructured</b> sources, convert COBOL Vision files, and facilitate database migration.|$|E
25|$|With {{the growth}} and spread of large, pagan gatherings and festivals in the 1980s, public {{varieties}} of Wicca continued to further diversify into additional, eclectic sub-denominations, often heavily influenced by the New Age and counter-culture movements. These open, <b>unstructured</b> or loosely structured traditions contrast with British Traditional Wicca, which emphasizes secrecy and initiatory lineage.|$|E
25|$|The plasma was an <b>unstructured</b> Gaussian sphere, with a {{strongly}} converged core that represented a small (~1%) {{part of the}} total volume. Nevins challenged this assumption, stating that the particles would build up angular momentum, causing the dense core to degrade. The loss of density inside the core would reduce fusion rates.|$|E
25|$|YF-17 {{aircraft}} Plot: The featured image displays {{plots of}} a CGNS dataset representing a YF-17 jet aircraft. The dataset {{consists of an}} <b>unstructured</b> grid with solution. The image was created by using a pseudocolor plot of the dataset's Mach variable, a Mesh plot of the grid, and Vector plot of a slice through the Velocity field.|$|E
25|$|Making {{a plan to}} {{complete}} tasks in a rigid schedule format might not work for everyone. There is no hard-and-fast rule to follow such a process {{if it turns out}} to be counter-productive. Instead of scheduling, it may be better to execute tasks in a flexible, <b>unstructured</b> schedule which has time slots for only necessary activities.|$|E
25|$|On {{the high}} {{wavelength}} side, the Hartley band transitions {{to the so-called}} Huggins band, which falls off rapidly until disappearing by ~360nm. Above 400nm, extending well out into the NIR, are the Chappius and Wulf bands. There, <b>unstructured</b> absorption bands are useful for detecting high ambient concentrations of ozone, but are so weak {{that they do not}} have much practical effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{mobile app}} enables groups to collect audio, video, {{photographs}} and other geo-referenced structured and <b>unstructured</b> data. The app design {{relies heavily on}} colours and icons, for use by semiliterate groups. Reports can be uploaded to the investigation dashboard either using the phone (if network is available) or by encrypted zip file. Currently the TIMBY app is only available for Android on the Google Play Store.|$|E
25|$|The random {{nature of}} <b>unstructured</b> sensors {{networks}} has motivated {{the use of}} stochastic geometry methods. For example, the tools of continuous percolation theory and coverage processes {{have been used to}} study the coverage and connectivity. One model that is used to study to these networks and wireless networks in general is the Poisson-Boolean model, which is a type of coverage process from continuum percolation theory.|$|E
25|$|Although histone {{modifications}} occur {{throughout the}} entire sequence, the <b>unstructured</b> N-termini of histones (called histone tails) are particularly highly modified. These modifications include acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, ribosylation and citrullination. Acetylation is the most highly studied of these modifications. For example, acetylation of the K14 and K9 lysines of the tail of histone H3 by histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) is generally related to transcriptional competence.|$|E
25|$|Business process {{management}} (BPM) is a discipline in operations management that uses various methods to discover, model, analyze, measure, improve, optimize, and automate business processes. BPM focuses on improving corporate performance by managing business processes. Any combination of {{methods used to}} manage a company's business processes is BPM. Processes can be structured and repeatable or <b>unstructured</b> and variable. Though not required, enabling technologies are often used with BPM.|$|E
25|$|After enjoying an {{informal}} and <b>unstructured</b> childhood, Elisabeth, who was shy and introverted by nature, and more so among the stifling formality of Habsburg court life, had difficulty {{adapting to the}} Hofburg and its rigid protocols and strict etiquette. Within a few weeks, Elisabeth started to display health problems: she had fits of coughing and became anxious and frightened whenever she had to descend a narrow steep staircase.|$|E
25|$|Data {{storage is}} a database, {{which is a}} {{collection}} of tables with typed columns. SQL Server supports different data types, including primary types such as Integer, Float, Decimal, Char (including character strings), Varchar (variable length character strings), binary (for <b>unstructured</b> blobs of data), Text (for textual data) among others. The rounding of floats to integers uses either Symmetric Arithmetic Rounding or Symmetric Round Down (fix) depending on arguments: SELECT Round(2.5, 0) gives 3.|$|E
25|$|Though {{assessment}} of psychological trauma may {{be conducted in}} an <b>unstructured</b> manner, assessment may also involve {{the use of a}} structured interview. Such interviews might include the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995), Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI; Bryant, Harvey, Dang, & Sackville, 1998), Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress (SIDES; Pelcovitz et al., 1997), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders- Revised (SCID-D; Steinberg, 1994), and Brief Interview for Posttraumatic Disorders (BIPD; Briere, 1998).|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{observation}} – Clinical {{psychologists are}} also trained {{to gather data}} by observing behavior. The clinical interview is {{a vital part of}} assessment, even when using other formalized tools, which can employ either a structured or <b>unstructured</b> format. Such assessment looks at certain areas, such as general appearance and behavior, mood and affect, perception, comprehension, orientation, insight, memory, and content of communication. One psychiatric example of a formal interview is the mental status examination, which is often used in psychiatry as a screening tool for treatment or further testing.|$|E
25|$|Feature models view {{semantic}} categories {{as being}} composed of relatively <b>unstructured</b> sets of features. The semantic feature-comparison model, proposed by Smith, Shoben, and Rips (1974), describes memory as being composed of feature lists for different concepts. According to this view, {{the relations between}} categories would not be directly retrieved, they would be indirectly computed. For example, subjects might verify a sentence by comparing the feature sets that represent its subject and predicate concepts. Such computational feature-comparison models include the ones proposed by Meyer (1970), Rips (1975), Smith, et al. (1974).|$|E
25|$|Close {{scrutiny}} of corporate governance and greater responsibility placed on directors to vouch for the reports {{submitted to the}} SEC and other federal agencies, {{have resulted in the}} growth of software solutions aimed at reducing the complexity, time and expense involved in creating the reports. This trend accelerated in 2008 {{with the passage of the}} Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Software as a service (SaaS) products allow corporate directors and internal auditors to assemble and analyze financial and other relevant data—including <b>unstructured</b> data—and create the needed reports quickly and without the need of an outside vendor.|$|E
25|$|The other {{principal}} thread {{within the}} civil-military theoretical debate was that generated in 1960 by Morris Janowitz in The Professional Soldier. Janowitz agreed with Huntington that separate {{military and civilian}} worlds existed, but differed from his predecessor regarding the ideal solution for preventing danger to liberal democracy. Since the military world {{as he saw it}} was fundamentally conservative, it would resist change and not adapt as rapidly as the more open and <b>unstructured</b> civilian society to changes in the world. Thus, according to Janowitz, the military would benefit from exactly what Huntington argued against – outside intervention.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} studies emphasise {{the potential for}} positive behavioural outcomes of isotretinoin treatment associated with its efficacy in treating acne and subsequent improvements in self-esteem. However, such studies are unable to support the conclusion that acne results in clinical depression, nor that isotretinoin treatment leads to an improvement in clinical measures of depression and/or anxiety. Many of the studies cited to support {{the existence of a}} relationship between isotretinoin treatment and decreased symptoms of depression and/or anxiety have significant methodological flaws. For instance, one of the most commonly cited studies involved just 10 patients assessed with <b>unstructured</b> psychiatric interview, involved no control group and didn't report any statistics.|$|E
