2500|$|His driver, Bobby Unser, {{had been}} testing a new Gurney-designed car at Phoenix International Raceway, and {{was unhappy with}} the car's {{performance}} on the track.

The device was fabricated and fitted in under an hour, but Unser's test laps with the modified wing turned in equally poor times. When Unser was able to speak to Gurney in confidence, he disclosed that the lap times with the new wing were slowed because it was now producing so much downforce that the car was <b>understeering.</b> All that was needed was to balance this by adding additional downforce in front.|$|E

5000|$|Fixing {{understeer}} or oversteer {{conditions is}} achieved by either an increase or decrease in grip on the front or rear axles. If the front axle has more grip than a similar vehicle with neutral steer characteristics, the vehicle will oversteer. The oversteering vehicle may be [...] "tuned" [...] by hopefully increasing rear axle grip, or alternatively by reducing front axle grip. The opposite is true for an <b>understeering</b> vehicle (rear axle has excess grip, fixed by increasing front grip or reducing rear grip).The following actions will have the tendency to [...] "increase the grip" [...] of an axle. Increasing moment arm distance to cg, reducing lateral load transfer (softening shocks, softening sway bars, increasing track width), increasing tire contact patch size, increasing the longitudinal load transfer to that axle, and decreasing tire pressure.|$|E
5000|$|EBD {{may work}} in {{conjunction}} with ABS and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) to minimize yaw accelerations during turns. ESC compares the steering wheel angle to vehicle turning rate using a yaw rate sensor. [...] "Yaw" [...] is the vehicle's rotation around its vertical center of gravity (turning left or right). If the yaw sensor detects more/less yaw than the steering wheel angle should create, the car is <b>understeering</b> or oversteering and ESC activates one of the front or rear brakes to rotate the car back onto its intended course. For example, if a car is making a left turn and begins to understeer (the car plows forward {{to the outside of}} the turn) ESC activates the left rear brake, which will help turn the car left. The sensors are so sensitive, and the actuation is so quick that the system may correct direction before the driver reacts. ABS helps prevent wheel lock-up and EBD helps apply appropriate brake force to make ESC work effectively and easily.|$|E

5000|$|Limousine Slalom: In a new {{variation}} on the show's many slalom challenges, the drivers are required to negotiate a slalom of foam people in the Lincoln Town Car limousine used for the Figure-Eight Challenge earlier in the season. Each driver will have three attempts, and must drive at 70 km/h in their runs. Michael, despite discussing the basic physics behind the challenge at length with Andrew, fails all three of his runs due to him completely releasing the accelerator while turning, which makes the limo's front-end too heavy to properly negotiate the slalom; eventually culminating in him driving into the adjoining field in his final run (something which every driver would do {{at least once in}} this challenge). Dale proves the worst performer on this challenge, and goes far off the track in her first run after hitting the gas rather than the brake when she left the track, then spins out on her second attempt. Andrew asks Dale to remember the techniques Shyamala taught her earlier in the season to help her keep her calm under pressure and remember the lessons, but Dale admits that she didn't actually pay any attention in their therapy session, much to the annoyance of Andrew and the experts. On her final attempt, Dale once again goes violently off the track, with the limo careening sideways for several dozen feet into the adjoining field. Kevin fails all three of his attempts due to gripping the steering wheel incorrectly and <b>understeering</b> on each of his turns. Finally, Sly ends up ensuring a 100% failure rate in this challenge; like Dale he goes far off the track on his first and third attempts, and hits most of the dummies on all three efforts.|$|E
5000|$|Charger Challenge: The Mega Challenge: This year's {{incarnation}} of the Mega Challenge is largely {{the same as those}} used in the previous two years, beginning with an Eye of the Needle and Slalom combo, followed by a precision drive forwards and then backwards through a short course of wheel rims (turning the car around in a section of concrete Jersey barriers in the middle), before attempting a reverse flick, and then navigating a short second Eye of the Needle course into an Icy Corner. Polly gets off to a decent start, carrying out the Eye of the Needle and Slalom combo flawlessly and only hitting two things in the forward precision steering section, but things quickly start going wrong when she turns the car around, as she hits it twelve times, before hitting several things while reversing. She then fails to even make it into the turning space for the Reverse Flick before hitting an arch in the second Eye of the Needle, before her run ends in disaster as she speeds, locks up her brakes and understeers on the Icy Corner, smashing through the wall. Jillian goes too slowly on the Eye of the Needle and Slalom (though doesn't hit anything), before hitting several things in the precision steering section, albeit while doing a much better job of turning the car around than Polly. She then fails the Reverse Flick by <b>understeering,</b> breaks that Charger's passenger-side wing mirror in the second Eye of the Needle, and then speeds and brakes too late in the Icy Corner. Sholom gets off to a terrible start, smashing two of the arches (and another passenger-side wing mirror) in the opening section, but does navigate the Charger through the first precision steering section and turn it around in the concrete barriers without hitting anything. He hits a lot of things while reversing however, and while he comes closest to passing the Reverse Flick, he fails it by clipping the barrier leading into the turning section. He also comes the closest to passing the Icy Corner, but fails after steering too late and hitting {{near the end of the}} boxes.|$|E

The purpose of this research is to analyze whether TLC might enlarge our understanding of the relation between vehicle handling characteristics and a driver's look-ing and lateral control strategy in a straight-lane-keeping task. Earlier results indicated that in the case of a normally <b>understeering</b> car, drivers accept occlusion periods that correlate highly with TLC. The present study shows that drivers are well able to maintain this strategy with a more heavily <b>understeering</b> vehicle.

40|$|The front-to-rear {{wheel torque}} {{distribution}} influences vehicle handling and, ultimately, affects key {{factors such as}} vehicle safety and performance. At a glance, {{as part of the}} available tire-road friction is used for traction on the driven axle, a Front-Wheel-Drive (FWD) vehicle would be expected to be more <b>understeering</b> than a Rear-Wheel-Drive (RWD) vehicle with equivalent characteristics. However, in specific conditions such effect may be counterbalanced, or even reversed, by the yaw moment caused by the lateral contribution, in the vehicle reference system, of the traction forces at the front wheels. This paper discusses the experimental assessment of the phenomenon in steady-state cornering, for a fully electric vehicle with multiple motors, allowing different front-to-rear wheel torque distributions. The results confirm that the yaw moment effect of the front traction forces is significant, especially at low vehicle speeds and high lateral accelerations. In particular, in the case study maneuvers, the RWD configuration of the vehicle resulted more <b>understeering</b> than the FWD one at the speed of 30 km/h...|$|E

40|$|The {{bifurcation}} {{analysis of}} a simple mathematical model describing a road vehicle with a driver is presented. The mechanical model of the car has {{two degrees of freedom}} and the related equations of motion contain the nonlinear tyre characteristics. The driver is described by a well-known model proposed in the literature. The road vehicle model has been validated in a case study. Bifurcation analysis is adopted as the proper procedure for analysing both steady-state cornering and straight ahead motion at different speeds. The importance of properly computing steady-state equilibria is highlighted. The effect of a skilled driver is to broaden the basin of attraction of stable equilibria and, in some cases, to stabilise originally unstable behaviours. Asubcritical Hopf bifurcation is normally found which limits the forward speed of either <b>understeering</b> or oversteering vehicles. A three-parameter bifurcation analysis is performed to understand the influence on stability of driver gain, of driver prediction time, of vehicle speed. It turns out, as expected from practice, that an oversteering vehicle is more challenging to be controlled than an <b>understeering</b> one.

The research provided a framework for an improved method of vehicle handling assessment that included non-linear regions of performance and transient behavior.

Four-wheel, two-axle vehicle models were evolved from simpler models and were extended to include vehicle roll dynamics and lateral load transfer effects. Nonlinearities stem from tire force characteristics that include for tire force saturation. Bifurcations were studied by quasi-static variations of vehicle speed and front steer angle. System models were expanded, assessing overall stability, including vehicle behavior outside normal operating ranges.

30|$|For {{differential}} braking control: (1) In general, to prevent rollover or oversteer accidents, braking on outside wheels on axles {{in front of}} the CG point can generate a larger extra yaw moment than on rear axles. (2) To prevent <b>understeering,</b> braking on the inside wheels on axles after the CG point can generate better effects than braking on the front axles. (3) The largest yaw moment changes generated by braking on each wheel are limited not only by initial forces of the tires, ability of air braking system, and steering angle but also by distances between the axles and CG position. (4) In terms of braking wheel, when the root of the quadratic sum of braking force and lateral force is equal to the radius of Kamm’s Circle, braking wheels on the rear axle need a complex control logic. When the truck is in the danger of drifting, braking on front axles is a better choice.|$|E

The {{traditional}} way of the matching between suspension parameters and vehicle performance is that we assess the matching of suspension design parameters through the driver's subjective experience, this will lead that the vehicle development cycle is long and high cost, meanwhile the matching during the parameters of suspension is blindness. With the development of computer technology, combining the modern design theory and virtual prototyping technology, based on multi-body system dynamics method, the virtual prototyping model of mini passenger car was built.

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} even an {{extremely}} simple nonlinear vehicle and driver model can show complex behaviors, like multi-stability and sensible dependence on the initial condition. The mechanical model of the car has two degrees of freedom, and the related equations of motion contain the nonlinear characteristics of the tires. The driver model is described by a single (nonlinear) equation, characterized by three parameters that describe how the driver steers the vehicle. Namely such parameters are the gain (steering angle per lateral deviation from desired path), the preview distance, and the reaction time delay. Bifurcation analysis is adopted to characterize straight ahead motion at different speeds, considering separately the two cases of <b>understeering</b> or oversteering cars. In the first case, {{we show that}} at suitable speeds the model can have three different attracting oscillating trajectories on which the system can work and that are reached due to different disturbances. In the second case, we confirm that instability arises if the forward speed is too high.

40|$|The {{handling}} behaviour {{of vehicles}} {{is an important}} property for its relation to performance and safety. In 1970 s, Pacejka did the groundwork for an objective analysis introducing the handling diagram and the understeer coefficient. In more recent years, the understeer concept is still mentioned but the handling is actively managed by direct yaw control (DYC). In this paper an accurate analysis of the vehicle handling is carried out, considering also the effect of drive forces. This analysis brings to a new formulation of the understeer coefficient, which is almost equivalent to the classical one, {{but it can be}} obtained by quasi-steady-state manoeuvres. In addition, it relates the vehicle yaw torque to the understeer coefficient, filling up the gap between the classical handling approach and DYC. A multibody model of a Formula SAE car is then used to perform quasi-steady-state simulations in order to verify the effectiveness of the new formulation. Some vehicle set-ups and wheel drive arrangements are simulated and the results are discussed. In particular, the handling behaviours of the rear wheel drive (RWD) and the front wheel drive (FWD) architectures are compared, finding an apparently surprising result: for the analysed vehicle the FWD is less <b>understeering</b> than for RWD. The relation between the yaw torque and the understeer coefficient allows to understand this behaviour and opens-up the possibility for different yaw control strategies...|$|E
40|$|Responding {{to changes}} in the road ahead is {{essential}} for successful driving. Steering control can be modeled using 2 complementary mechanisms: guidance control (to anticipate future steering requirements) and compensatory control (to stabilize position-in-lane). Drivers seem to rapidly sample the visual information needed for steering using active gaze patterns, but the way in which this perceptual information is combined remains unclear. Influential models of steering capture many steering behaviors using just ‘far’ and ‘near’ road regions to inform guidance and compensatory control respectively (Salvucci & Gray, 2004). However, optic flow can influence steering even when road-edges are visible (Kountouriotis, Mole, Merat, & Wilkie, 2016). Two experiments assessed whether flow selectively interacted with compensatory and/or guidance levels of steering control, under either unconstrained gaze or constrained gaze conditions. Optic flow speed was manipulated independent of the veridical road-edges so that use of flow would lead to predictable <b>understeering</b> or oversteering. Steering was found to systematically vary according to flow speed, but crucially the Flow-Induced Steering Bias (FISB) magnitude depended on which road-edge components were visible. The presence of a guidance signal increased the influence of flow, with the largest FISB in ‘Far’ and ‘Complete’ road conditions, whereas the smallest FISB was observed when only ‘Near’ road-edges were visible. Gaze behaviors influenced steering to some degree, but did not fully explain the interaction between flow and road-edges. Overall the experiments demonstrate that optic flow can act indirectly upon steering control by modulating the guidance signal provided by a demarcated pat...|$|E
