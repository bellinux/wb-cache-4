40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the relationship among}} disordered urban sprawl, environmental precariousness and health conditions in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, {{in the first decade}} of the 21 st century, according to the Census data and vital records available for 2009 and 2010. The analysis is performed based on the methodology of the Observatório das Metrópoles and on the categorization of the types of municipality of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. To the capital city of the Metropolitan Region a division of rings is used which allows you to work with the district data in a grouped way and to establish comparisons in an intra urban context. The construction of the typology of municipalities was designed from a factor analysis of the distribution of the working and resident population in 39 municipalities, according to the socio-occupational hierarchy, and it was an important tool for the analysis of living conditions and population health which is unevenly distributed across the metropolitan area and benefits unequally from the community facilities and urban infrastructure. The text also addresses the relationship between habitat and health conditions, pointing to the causes of deterioration of vulnerable social groups living in environmental risk areas or in areas with high concentration of poverty, especially on the periphery. Infant and childhood mortality, by typology of municipality point, in turn, to relevant inequalities in the different areas of the metropolitan region. The <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>urban</b> <b>settlement</b> on fresh water sources sensitive areas compromises the water quality of the population, increases the heat islands, modifying the microclimate and increasing not only rainfall but erosion as well. The urban sprawl area, in synergy with global warming causes increase in rainfall in major growing areas of the metropolis, broadening the risk areas. These events, linked to high population density in the largest metropolitan area in the country, create a scenario of possible implications for public health, including water contamination, either by ingestion, water contact diseases (in case of leptospirosis) or by the proliferation of vector borne diseases (including dengue fever), causing increased vulnerability, especially among children and the elderly...|$|E

40|$|Most {{people in}} the world live in <b>urban</b> <b>settlements,</b> and <b>urban</b> <b>settlements</b> are also the {{location}} of many environmentally damaging activities. A sustainable future is dependent on the design of sustainable <b>urban</b> <b>settlements.</b> It is now widely recognised that sustainability theory and practice must deal with the dynamics and uncertainties of the evolving world in which we live. The dynamics of an evolving world present a challenge to design for sustainable <b>urban</b> <b>settlements,</b> when design is viewed in a conventional way. Conventional ideas tend to assume limited and fully determined outcomes from design. However, experience tells us that designed changes have often brought unintended and unexpected consequences for sustainability. It is argued, therefore, that a new concept of design is required with its roots in the cultural and biophysical interactions of evolving <b>urban</b> <b>settlements.</b> Drawing on theories of non-equilibrium,systems,notably on the theory of dissipative structures, the evolutionary dynamics that integrate cultural and biophysical change in an <b>urban</b> <b>settlement,</b> and are the generators of uncertainty, are described by reference to a case study of the Western Suburbs of Melbourne. The links between theory and the case study are established by application of an adapted version of the Slocombe/Gryzbowski method for identifying and describing the evolutionary dynamics of large scale cultural-biophysical systems. With minor modifications, the method's step-by-step procedure, is used to establish relationships between evolutionary change and the sustainability of the <b>urban</b> <b>settlement,</b> and the role of design in both. The case study supports the idea that design is deeply embedded in the evolution of an <b>urban</b> <b>settlement</b> and its sustainability. Drawing on the findings from the case study, a range of new characteristics of design for sustainable <b>urban</b> <b>settlements</b> are proposed. Together these establish a new model of design for sustainable <b>urban</b> <b>settlements,</b> that incorporates the dynamics of evolving systems, and replaces the conventional and purely deterministic model. In the new model, design is found to be an instrument of change and uncertainty. At the same time it has the capacity to endow <b>urban</b> <b>settlements</b> with the flexibility necessary to persist and adapt to new circumstances. As such it is both a risky and experimental activity, but one with which we must engage if we are to ensure a sustainable futureRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
