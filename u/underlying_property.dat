According to Lazarus and Folkman [(1984). Stress, appraisal and coping. New York: Springer] all meaningful situations that are appraised as stressful will include one of eight properties. These properties are: novelty, predictability, event uncertainty, imminence, duration, temporal uncertainty, ambiguity and timing in relation to the life cycle. Design: This study aimed to examine whether these <b>underlying</b> <b>properties</b> are relevant to the sporting context and if any further properties exist within this context using a qualitative interview approach. Methods: Sixteen national level trampolinists took part in interviews which focused on their most stressful competitive experience. Results: Following deductive content analysis all properties were found to have relevance to a sporting domain. Two further properties of Self and Other Comparison and Inadequate Preparation were also revealed which were proposed to be specific to a sporting context.

The <b>underlying</b> <b>property</b> rights of the landowner in unextracted minerals have not been destroyed in theory, but such rights can no longer be of much practical use. The state, in its custodial role, is endowed with the capacity to regulate access to the resources and is obliged to ensure their optimal exploitation.|$|E
