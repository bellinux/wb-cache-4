5|$|In November 2012, The FreeBSD Security Team {{announced}} that hackers gained <b>unauthorized</b> <b>access</b> {{on two of}} the project's servers. These servers were turned off immediately. More research demonstrated that the first <b>unauthorized</b> <b>access</b> by hackers occurred on 19 September. Apparently hackers gained access to these servers by stealing SSH keys from one of the developers, not by exploiting a bug in the operating system itself. These two hacked servers were part of the infrastructure used to build third-party software packages. The FreeBSD Security Team checked the integrity of the binary packages and {{announced that}} no unauthorized change was made to the binary packages, but they stated that they can't guarantee the integrity of packages that were downloaded between 19 September and 11 November.|$|E
5|$|Convicted {{computer}} {{criminals are}} people who are caught and convicted of computer crimes such as breaking into computers or computer networks. Computer crime can be broadly defined as criminal activity involving information technology infrastructure, including illegal access (<b>unauthorized</b> <b>access),</b> illegal interception (by technical means of non-public transmissions of computer data to, from or within a computer system), data interference (unauthorized damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data), systems interference (interfering with the functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data), misuse of devices, forgery (or identity theft) and electronic fraud.|$|E

In this article we introduce the design and implementation of a load balancer that distinguishes between the traffic coming from clients and the traffic originated from the attackers, in an attempt to simultaneously mitigate the problems of both latency and security.

25|$|Cyberterrorism {{was dealt}} with in various ways. Penalties apply to those who either damage or gain <b>unauthorized</b> <b>access</b> to a {{protected}} computer and then commit a number of offenses. These offenses include causing a person to lose an aggregate amount greater than US$5,000, as well as adversely affecting someone's medical examination, diagnosis or treatment. It also encompasses actions that cause a person to be injured, a threat to public health or safety, or damage to a governmental computer that {{is used as a}} tool to administer justice, national defense or national security. Also prohibited was extortion undertaken via a protected computer. The penalty for attempting to damage protected computers through the use of viruses or other software mechanism was set to imprisonment for up to 10 years, while the penalty for <b>unauthorized</b> <b>access</b> and subsequent damage to a protected computer was increased to more than five years imprisonment. However, should the offense occur a second time, the penalty increases up to 20 years imprisonment.|$|E
40|$|An OLAP (On-line Analytic Processing) {{system with}} {{insufficient}} security countermeasures may disclose sensitive information and breach an individual’s privacy. Both <b>unauthorized</b> <b>accesses</b> and malicious inferences {{may lead to}} such inappropriate disclosures. Existing access control models in relational databases are unsuitable for the multidimensional data cubes used by OLAP. Inference control methods in statistical databases are expensive and apply to limited situations only. We first devise a flexible framework for specifying authorization objects in data cubes. The framework can partition a data cube both vertically based on dimension hierarchies and horizontally based on slices of data. We then study how to control inferences in data cubes. The proposed method eliminates both <b>unauthorized</b> <b>accesses</b> and malicious inferences. Its effectiveness {{does not depend on}} specific types of aggregation functions, external knowledge, or sensitivity criteria. The technique is efficient and readily implementable. Its on-line performance overhead is comparable to that of the minimal security requirement. Its enforcement requires little modification to existing OLAP systems. 1...|$|R

As computer attacks are becoming more and more difficult to identify the need for better and more efficient intrusion detection systems increases. The main problem with current intrusion detection systems is high rate of false alarms. Using honeypots provides effective solution to increase the security.

25|$|Placing {{the hand}} of a dead or {{unconscious}} person on a scanner to gain <b>unauthorized</b> <b>access</b> has become a common plot device.
