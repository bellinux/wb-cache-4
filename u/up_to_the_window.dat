500|$|A {{number of}} other {{successful}} [...] "drive up" [...] businesses have their roots in the 1950s, including McDonald's (expanded c. 1955), which had no dine-in facilities, requiring customers to park and walk <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> taking their order [...] "to go". Automation {{and the lack of}} dining facilities allowed McDonald's to sell burgers for 15 cents each, instead of the typical 35 cents, and people were buying them by the bagful. By 1948, they had fired their carhops, installed larger grills, reduced their menu and radically changed the industry by introducing assembly-line methods of food production, similar to the auto industry, dubbing it the [...] "Speedee Service System". They redesigned their sign specifically {{to make it easier to}} see from the road, creating the now familiar yellow double-arch structure. Businessman Ray Kroc joined McDonald's as a franchise agent in 1955. He subsequently purchased the chain from the McDonald brothers and oversaw its worldwide growth.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain {{returned}} to London in triumph. Large crowds mobbed Heston, {{where he was}} met by the Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of Clarendon, who gave him a letter from King George VI assuring him of the Empire's lasting gratitude and urging him to come straight to Buckingham Palace to report. The streets were so packed with cheering people that it took Chamberlain {{an hour and a}} half to journey the nine miles (14km) from Heston to the Palace. After reporting to the King, Chamberlain and his wife appeared on the Palace balcony with the King and Queen. He then went to Downing Street; both the street and the front hall of Number 10 were packed. As he headed upstairs to address the crowd from a first-floor window, someone called to him, [...] "Neville, go <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and say 'peace for our time'." [...] Chamberlain turned around and responded, [...] "No, I don't do that sort of thing." [...] Nevertheless, Chamberlain recalled the words of his predecessor, Benjamin Disraeli and his return from the Congress of Berlin in his statement to the crowd: ...|$|E

2500|$|All AMCs, {{including}} the Spirit, received a new rust-proofing process called Ziebart Factory Rust Protection.

Eagles were backed by the AMC Buyer Protection Plan, a 12 month/ warranty on everything except the tires.|$|E

2500|$|Night falls; now remorseful, she unburies him but cannot {{remember}} where the wrench is. She helps {{him back to}} the cabin, where she tells him she does [...] "not yet" [...] want to kill him, adding that [...] "when the three beggars arrive someone must die." [...] In a flashback [...] she watches Nic climbing <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> but she does not act, thus displaying her essential evil much like her hypothesis. In the cabin she cuts off her clitoris with scissors. They are visited by the crow, the deer, and the fox. A hailstorm begins; earlier it had been revealed that women accused of witchcraft had been known to have the power to summon hailstorms. Finding the wrench under the floorboards, he is stabbed by her with the scissors, but is able to unbolt the grindstone. Finally free, he shows a vicious face, and strangles her to death. He then burns her on a funeral pyre.|$|E

50|$|In 1860, bishop Motiejus Valančius began {{preparations}} {{for construction of}} a new church in Panevėžys. However, after the Uprising of 1863, the Tsarist authorities implemented Russification policies, including the Lithuanian press ban and suppression of the Catholic Church. The authorities forbade construction of any new Catholic churches and closed the Piarist church leaving only the Church of Saints Peter and Paul <b>to</b> service <b>the</b> Catholic inhabitants of Panevėžys. A permission for construction was obtained in 1904, but the work was delayed by the Russo-Japanese War and the Revolution of 1905 until 1908. Until World War I, a rectory and a temporary chapel were completed while church's walls rose <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> <b>The</b> church was <b>to</b> be named after Saint Stanislaus the Martyr.|$|R
