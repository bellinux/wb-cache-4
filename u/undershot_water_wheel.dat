50|$|Barnack {{water mill}} {{was built in}} the 18th century. Its <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> is in situ but none of the mill's {{interior}} machinery remains.|$|E
50|$|At New Hope, {{engineers}} connected an <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> {{to another}} wheel with buckets, which lifted {{water from the}} Delaware River up into the canal using only {{the force of the}} river current.|$|E
5|$|The Watermill at Opwetten is {{situated}} {{along the river}} Kleine Dommel. Diverted river water flows along a channel with force to drive two wooden <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels,</b> connected to two buildings {{on either side of}} the channel.|$|R
5000|$|The French Mill {{is a rare}} {{example of}} a tidal flour mill on a dam across the Carew inlet. The present {{building}} dates from the 18th century, but the French Mill was mentioned in 1476. The mill has not functioned since the 1930s, but its equipment is all still in place. It has two large <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels,</b> driving seven sets of mill stones.|$|R
5000|$|Clock Mill was {{powered by}} three iron <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels,</b> two of 6.1m {{diameter}} {{and one of}} 5.9m diameter. These wheels drove six pairs of millstones at 130 revolutions per minute. This mill operated until 1952. When the mills were both operating in 1938, the site employed one millwright and four carpenters. During the daily 7-8 hours of tidal power, the <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> ran at 16 revolutions per minute with a working head of 3.0-3.7m. This produced some 7-9kW to turn each millstone.|$|R
50|$|A door leads out {{the back}} to the paper store, a large room now housing an archive of nearly every printed job for a century. At one end the <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> which {{originally}} powered the works has been reconstructed.|$|E
50|$|On the Delaware Division canal, the Delaware River {{was made}} to pump its own water into the canal, using an <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> which was {{connected}} to another wheel which had buckets attached, thereby lifting the river water up to the canal.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Glanworth Mill=== Glanworth mill {{is located}} {{along the banks}} of the River Funcheon and sits below the {{imposing}} Norman castle. Built during the 1840 as part of a famine relief scheme it is the last remaining reverse <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> in Ireland.|$|E
50|$|The {{watermill}} complex {{was made}} up out of two buildings, operating two <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels.</b> One building was a gristmill, while another functioned as oil mill. The gristmill and oil mill are both still in functioning order and are used on a small scale. Vincent van Gogh lived nearby and made several paintings while in the area, including a painting of the mill in 1884. The watermill was listed as a national monument in 1972.|$|R
40|$|Sagebien and Zuppinger <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> are {{hydropower}} converters {{for head}} differences between 0. 3 - 1. 5 m. Today, {{because of the}} renewed demand for micro hydropower utilisation, these <b>undershot</b> low-head <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> may offer an attractive solution. In this paper, comparative model tests at approximately 1 : 10 scale are reported. The Sagebien wheel was extensively tested using 30 instead of the standard 80 blades {{to create a more}} cost-effective solution. The efficiency of Sagebien and Zuppinger wheels was determined as a function of flow rate, wheel speed and head difference. The maximum efficiency of both wheels was 84 %. The performance of the Sagebien wheel was less affected by the flow rate, with the efficiency slightly decreasing with increasing head difference. The maximum efficiency of the Zuppinger wheel reduces with reducing flow rate and head difference. In particular the Sagebien wheel has interesting environmental advantages...|$|R

50|$|The Newtown Pumphouse raised {{water from}} the River Severn to the canal, {{initially}} using an <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> to operate two bucket pumps. This was supplemented by a steam engine for times when the waterwheel failed to provide sufficient power. In time this arrangement {{was replaced by a}} diesel powered pump.|$|E
50|$|A scoop wheel {{produces}} {{a lot of}} spray. They were frequently encased in a brick building. To maintain efficiency when the river into which the water was discharged was of variable level, or tidal, a 'rising breast' was used, a sort of inclined sluice. The basic construction is, of necessity, similar to an <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> and {{overshot}} water wheel, both animal- and water-driven, {{and with}} either a compartmented body (Latin tympanum) or a compartmented rim, were used by Hellenistic engineers between the 3rd and 2nd century BC. Around 300 AD, the Romans replaced the wooden compartments with separate, attached ceramic pots that were tied {{to the outside of}} an open-framed wheel, thereby creating the noria.|$|E
50|$|The present Carew Tidal Mill has two <b>water</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{one with}} the date of 1801, so was {{probably}} built around that time.The floodgates in the causeway dam were opened as the tide rose and filled the mill pond, then closed to contain {{the water in the}} pool when the tide began to ebb. When there was enough difference between the water levels the miller opened the sluice gates so the water would run from the pond through sluices under the mill, driving the water wheels.There are two 4.8 m <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> with wooden bucket paddles.One <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> is 1.65 m wide and the other is 2.1 m wide. Both have 225 mm square shafts.|$|R

Less common types of hydro schemes use water's kinetic energy or undammed sources such as <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels.</b> Tidal power is viable in {{a relatively small number of}} locations around the world. In Great Britain, there are eight sites that could be developed, which have the potential to generate 20% of the electricity used in 2012.|$|R
50|$|In 1789 Smeaton applied an idea by Denis Papin, {{by using}} a force pump to {{maintain}} the pressure and fresh air inside a diving bell. This bell, built for the Hexham Bridge project, was not intended for underwater work, but in 1790 the design was updated to enable it to be used underwater on the breakwater at Ramsgate Harbour. Smeaton is also credited with explaining the fundamental differences and benefits of overshot versus <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels.</b> Smeaton experimented with the Newcomen steam engine and made marked improvements around the time James Watt was building his first engines (ca. late 1770s).|$|R
5000|$|The Mill Museum - This <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> mill found off Shop Street, which traces {{its origin}} to the 17th century, was in {{operation}} until 1964. It {{is the only}} preserved corn mill in the West of Ireland. The Mill Museum complex, located beside the river Nanny, consists of the restored corn mill with operating water wheel, an audiovisual museum and Tourist Information Office.|$|E
50|$|Between barge {{and boat}} well is the <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel,</b> which {{is driven by}} the flowing water of the current. There is also {{evidence}} of water mills for which both sides had a narrower water wheel, similar to an old paddle steamer. The floating platform is anchored at the most intense point in the current, to the bridge piers for easy access to the mill, or to the shore.|$|E
50|$|The former church sawmill (Kirchensäge), {{later called}} the Schütte Sawmill (Schüttesäge), (its owner was the publican of the zur Schütte inn in Wolfach), was first {{mentioned}} {{at this site}} in 1491. It was operated as a sawmill until 1931. Today it still has an <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> with a diameter of 7.20 metres that still drives the transmission machinery. The water-powered facility is a protected monument. The museum was opened in 1989 by the town of Schiltach.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} several {{buildings}} in the watermill complex. One building was a gristmill and sawmill, while another functioned as oil mill and fulling mill. The mill operated two <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels,</b> including the largest <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> in the Netherlands. The gristmill is still in functioning order and is used on a small scale, {{the building of the}} former oil and fulling mill now houses a restaurant. [...] A tannery was located in a building in the back and up to 1910 an inn was located in the miller's house. Vincent van Gogh lived nearby and made several paintings while in the area, including a painting of the mill in 1884. The watermill was listed as a national monument in 1972.|$|R

ABSTRACT: The fascinating mechanical inventions aiming at {{the welfare of the}} human kind started from ancient Egyptians and continued development through different eras. In the medieval centuries, the Islamic civilization paid wonderful attention to mechanical engineering. Banu Mosa invented 100 ingenious devices including automatic fountains and automatic feedback level control systems. Al-Jazari invented 50 mechanical devices including automatic fountains, clocks, positive displacement pumps and robotics. Taqi Al-Din invented a 6 -cylinder positive displacement pump. Those great inventers used clean-energy prime movers in the form of windmills, overshot <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> and <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> (turbines). This paper focuses only on windmills, <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> and automatic fountains...|$|R
50|$|In 1803, Joseph von Baader {{replaced}} {{these works}} by {{more powerful and}} quieter pumping installations which are still operating. From the canal, small headraces feed two <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> in the central section of the Green Pump House. The smaller <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> has a diameter of 4.70 m, a width of 1.27 m and 36 blades. The wheel is connected to a crankshaft operating the pumping works in the adjoining room. Connecting rods raise and lower three large beams (balanciers). Their other end is connected via pumping rods to six pistons {{moving up and down}} in vertical cylinders. The frame of the machine is of oak wood, the beams and rods are made of cast iron, the crank is of wrought iron. The pistons and cylinders are made of brass. The pistons are wrapped in leather envelopes for smooth running and thightening and the leather is kept wet and supple by water from separate little pipes. The pistons' stroke length is 65 cm.|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, Jewel Medlin {{purchased}} the property. His wife Leta and daughter Zoe Medlin Caywood found blueprints and rebuilt the mill {{for the third}} time. The design was modified slightly {{to bring back the}} <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> that had been used over 100 years earlier. War Eagle Mill is the only working watermill in Arkansas, and is powered by an eighteen-foot cypress water wheel. [...] They mill and sell organic grain, cereal and flour products commercially on site.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} the Williams-Droescher Mill, Droescher's Mill is the last {{remaining}} mill on the Rahway River. It was constructed in 1737 by Benjamin Williams as a saw mill alongside a dam. Williams used {{the flow of the}} river to turn an <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> to power his saws. Lumber cut here went into the construction of the first houses built in the area. Shortly before his death in 1779, Williams erected a second building only a few feet from his sawmill for the manufacture of woolens.|$|E
50|$|John Lombe's idea of mill was {{inspired}} by contemporary smaller and less effective mills he studied during {{the period in which}} he worked in Italy: traditionally the spinning wheel was used for producing small quantities of silk thread at the homes of local spinsters, the new machines were capable of producing far greater quantities of silk and provided serious competition for the Italians. The machines required large buildings and a power source. An <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> turned by the mill fleam {{on the west side of}} the new mill drove the spinning machines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} documentary {{reference to}} the Trafford Mill is in the Cheshire Chamberlains' Accounts of 1302-03. Further documentary records of the mill are in 1464 in {{the records of the}} Troutbeck family and in the Land Tax returns between 1784 and 1832. The building was offered for lease in an October 1767 edition of the Chester Chronicle. It was described in that advertisement in the form it is in now as 'this new built corn mill' thus dating the building at around 1760, nearly 100 years older than previously thought. It was sold at the Shrewsbury Sale of 1917 at which time it consisted of a three-floor corn mill, including two <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> (one of which was out of repair), a drying kiln, a barn, a stable and a shippon. [...] In 1952 it ceased to be a working mill and was taken over by the North West Water Authority (now United Utilities). It was in a derelict condition and in the 1970s it was re-roofed and other repairs were made. Further repairs were made in 1998.|$|R
40|$|Energy, {{especially}} electricity, plays a {{vital role}} in global social and economic development. High annual rain rate in Malaysia seems a good potential for electricity generation especially through small hydro powers. <b>Undershot</b> <b>water</b> turbines are one of the hydropower turbines used for many years. However, the effect of blade depth immersed in the flowing water is not fully investigated. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to study the effect of immersed blade depth for straight blade <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> turbine in power generation by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. ANSYS CFX 15. 0 was used to perform three dimensional analysis under steady state, incompressible, and non-isothermal conditions. The <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> with number of blades of 6 and four different immersed depth was applied for each simulation. There are four different immersed depth was applied to each simulation, which are 20 mm, 40 mm, 60 mm and 80 mm. From the simulation result, it was found that the optimum immersed depth is 40 mm where the torque load and power generated were 0. 264 N. m and 1. 318 Watt respectively...|$|R
40|$|During the eighteenth, {{nineteenth and}} {{the first half of}} the twentieth century, <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> were {{important}} hydraulic energy converters. It is estimated that in England 25, 000 – 30, 000 wheels were in operation around 1850; in Germany 33, 500 <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> were recorded as late as 1925. Today, only very few <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> are still in use. Low head hydropower is seldom exploited, since cost-effective energy converters for these conditions are not available. A small number of companies are currently again manufacturing apparently economically attractive over- and <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> wheels; the performance characteristics of these wheels are however unclear so that the assessment of the potential of a site as well as their design and efficient operation relies on estimates. A number of engineering textbooks and three detailed experimental studies of <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> design and performance were published between 1850 and 1935, but nowadays appear to be virtually unknown. A detailed study of these reports was conducted, and the performance characteristics of overshot <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> were analysed in order to assess the application of such wheels for electricity generation. It was found that <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> have to be designed for a given flow rate, head difference and intended operating regime. Properly designed overshot wheels have an efficiency of 85 %, undershot wheels of approximately 75 % for 0. 2 < Q/Qmax < 1. 0, making this type of energy converter suitable for the exploitation of highly variable flows. <b>Water</b> <b>wheels</b> must, however, be operated within certain parameter ranges in order to be able to perform efficiently; they appear to offer an efficient and cost-effective solution for the exploitation of low head hydropower sources...|$|R
50|$|A {{spiral tube}} water wheel {{is a method}} of pumping water by using an <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> which has a scoop {{connected}} to a spiral tube. As the wheel turns the scoop will alternatively introduce either water or air into the spiral tube. The pressure generated from the column of water introduced by the scoop {{is added to the}} pressure from previous scoops and so as the wheel turns it will increase the water pressure with every turn of the spiral. These wheels have only one moving part and have been known to pump water with no maintenance for several years.|$|E
5000|$|The old Stratford Mill {{shown in}} Constable's {{painting}} dates from around 1600. A group of Sudbury Merchants and gentlemen formed [...] "The Stower Navigation Company" [...] in 1708, making the river navigable to bring coal upriver and to transport corn, straw and hay downstream to be offloaded {{and shipped to}} London. It was a busy, prosperous waterway until the railways took away the trade. The mill was demolished about 1850 and replaced by a vast structure of five floors with a 15 ft <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> and an auxiliary steam engine for use when the river was low.|$|E
5000|$|The river {{starts from}} {{the south side of}} Grimwith Reservoir and flows {{south-west}} through Burnett Fold Nook and then south before returning south-west to pass under the B6265 at Dibble's Bridge, which has been the scene of two coach crashes - one in 1925 when seven people were killed, and one in 1975 when 32 people were killed. Below its confluence with Holes Beck, the Ordnance Survey maps show the name of the river changing to Barben Beck. It follows a mostly southerly course through Rough Close Wood and Barnscar Plantation to Rookcroft Wood. It turns west through Sprinsgide Wood and then south-west again past Hartlington Mill, where it was once used to power a 5.5 m-diameter <b>undershot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel,</b> and under Hartlington Bridge before joining the River Wharfe.http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/opendata/viewer/ ...|$|E
5000|$|The Murphys {{invested}} {{a considerable}} sum {{in establishing a}} large distilling operation at the site, which was to become known as James Murphy and Company. A large <b>undershot</b> timber <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> was installed to help power the distillery (which was replaced in 1852, by an iron <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> which survives on-site to this day). In addition, a mammoth 31,618 pot still was constructed at the distillery which remains the largest ever built. The pot still was so large, that {{it needed to be}} assembled on-site with the distillery built around it. The ambition of the Murphys (and the effect of the 1823 excise reforms) is underlined by the fact that just two years earlier, the largest pot still in Ireland had a capacity of just 750 gallons. In 1827, Murphy's distillery is reported to have produced over 188,000 proof gallons of spirit, and by the 1830s, distillery output had risen further, to 400,000 proof gallons per annum, with the distillery having a payroll of nearly 200.In the mid-1800s, the Irish whiskey industry underwent a period of turmoil, with temperance movement of the 1830s, and the Great Famine of the 1840s reducing domestic demand for whiskey. At the time, Cork was home to several distilleries, therefore, in the 1860s, James Murphy (head of the company, and son of the founder), suggested amalgamating the operations of several local distilleries. The other distilleries agreed, so in 1867, Cork Distilleries Company (CDC) was formed, with Murphy at the helm. In 1867, CDC took control of four Cork distilleries: North Mall, The Green, Watercourse and Daly's, and a year later Midleton Distillery joined the fold.In 1886, Alfred Barnard, a British historian visited the distillery, describing its location close to both rail and water carriage, amidst large corn-growing country as a desirable location to establish a distillery. In addition to the 31,618 gallon wash still, Barnard stated that the distillery boasted two 10,000 gallon spirits stills, and unusually for an Irish distillery at the time, a Coffey Still. The distillery, which was lit by gas, was reported to have an output in excess of 1,000,000 gallons per annum, and to produce a whiskey known as [...] "The Cork Whisky Make". In later years, whiskey from the distillery was known as Cork Distilleries Company Old Irish Whisky, before becoming known as simply [...] "Paddy".|$|R
