40|$|This paper {{describes}} a complete fade countermeasure system, designed for thin route user-oriented and fully meshed satellite networks. The signal degradation {{due to the}} residual uplink attenuation after up-power control intervention, plus the down-link attenuation, is compensated for by varying the FEC coding and bit rates of the data. Down and <b>up-link</b> <b>signal</b> degradations are evaluated separately: the former by collecting statistics of quantised levels of the demodulated PSK signal, and the latter by using a narrow band signal level estimator. Measurement times are optimised using a model to evaluate the scintillation variance. The performance evaluation of the whole system {{in the presence of}} additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), shows that very small link power margins can be adopted...|$|E

The Command Receiver and Decoder {{portion of}} this sub-system receives the rf <b>up-link</b> <b>signal</b> and initiates the flight termination action. For launch vehicles for unmanned spacecraft, the range safety up-link command signal is composed of selected IRIG audio tones, in a specified sequence, frequency modulated on an rf carrier. For the Space Shuttle launches, a more sophisticated high-alphabet modulation technique is used. This provides for a better probability against an undesired output caused by interfering signals. The Shuttle system uses a complex command modulation format composed of various audio tones frequency modulated on the standard UHF carrier. The characters in the command word are made up of two simultaneously transmitted tones selected from seven possible frequencies. These seven tones, taken two at a time, provide an alphabet of twenty-one different characters from which a command word is formed. The transmitted sequence of characters is selectable from mission to mission. Approximately 1012 possible code combinations exist for any one mission. For the Space Shuttle launches, the range safety Command Receiver-Decoders will be used on the Solid Rocket Boosters and the External Tank portions of the complex launch vehicle. The receiver section of these units is a single superheterodyne design fixed tuned to the proper rf center frequency at the time of manufacture. The decoder section utilizes a microprocessor to effect the decoding function. The decoder is “programmed” prior to flight to recognize only the code of the mission. In addition, the microprocessor is used to accomplish the audio tone demodulation using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. Solid state output switches provide the decoder output voltages to the flight termination destruct mechanism...|$|E

Today audiovisual communication takes place at different locations and in a large variety of acoustic environments. In consequence, the intelligibility {{as well as the}} quality of speech may significantly be degraded by ambient background noise. In order to improve speech intelligibility and to ensure a convenient communication with high audio quality, speech enhancement techniques are required. In this thesis all critical components contributing to the enhancement of the <b>up-link</b> <b>signal</b> are addressed: • signal capturing at the acoustic front-end with a new near field beam former, • new codebook based speech and noise estimation procedure generating and exploiting reliability information, and • actual noise reduction exploiting spectral dependencies of human speech. For the acoustic front-end of the digital processing chain a novel concept for the filter optimization of a near field beamformer is introduced. The optimization scheme allows to closely approximate a predefined reception characteristic which can be freely chosen according to the application. The output of the beamformer provides a pre-enhanced signal with improved SNR for subsequent single-microphone based speech enhancement. Single-microphone noise reduction usually relies on statistical properties of speech and noise. In general, the noise is assumed to be stationary or only slightly time-varying, which is in practice often not fulfilled. Due to imprecise noise estimation, single-microphone systems are prone to unpleasant artifacts that are called musical tones. In this context different Information Combining methods, merging various estimates, are presented which address specifically the problem of non-stationary noise signals, leading to a significant improved estimation accuracy. On the one hand, the proposed Information Combining is used with respect to spectral dependencies of human speech. On the other hand, it merges the best of several speech and noise estimates depending on their reliability. The necessary estimates are provided by a new statistical noise estimator as well as a codebook driven speech and noise estimation algorithm. The achieved estimation quality opens up the possibility to close the gap between the conflicting goals of high noise attenuation, low speech distortion, and the prevention of undesired musical tone artifacts. Finally, the practical aspects of the proposed enhancement systems are considered and discussed with two implemented real-time demonstrators...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the ecological behaviors of whales, we are developing WEOS (Whale Ecology Observation Satellite) system composed of probes attached to whales, a dedicated satellite and a ground station. In this system, whale locations are estimated from Doppler shifts in <b>up-link</b> <b>signals</b> received by WEOS whose orbit is known pre-cisely enough. In order to localize WEOS itself, we developed an accurate localization technique based on GPS. The trajectory of WEOS is traced every tens of seconds {{for about an hour}} by the GPS receiver loaded on WEOS with accuracy about 30 meters. Since its Keplerian elements stay practically constant during one session of Doppler shift measurement, they can be estimated by minimizing the square deviation between the locations calculated from them and those measured hundreds times by GPS. Resul-tant Keplerian elements provide WEOS location with errors as small as a few meters. 1...|$|R
40|$|Separation of co-channel {{communication}} signals {{using multiple}} antennas and Digital Signal Processing(DSP) based algorithms {{is a topic}} of great interest due to its implications for system capacity and frequency reuse. This thesis proposes two methods for timing and carrier recovery, synchronization, spatial signature estimation and separation of co-channel <b>up-link</b> <b>signals.</b> In some propagation scenarios, {{this is the most}} general problem possible on this topic. The first method proceeds by using an appropriately designed bank of filters to force a well understood synchronous model on the incoming signal. An extended Kalman Filter is then used to obtain estimates of the spatial signatures and carrier offsets which can then be used to separate the co-channel signals. The second method proceeds by oversampling the antenna base-band signals and uses algebraic properties of statistical quantities associated with the signals to estimate relevant parameters and computationally separate the signals of the different users. The modeling, receiver paradigms, optimizations, tradeoffs and compromises necessary are discussed and simulation results presented. ...|$|R

Analog and other smart repeaters are general broadband amplifiers that boost mobile signals of all base stations without control. For example, signals are boosted from these base stations, which cause uncontrolled signal levels on the down-link and <b>up-link.</b> Phone <b>signals</b> on the <b>up-link</b> may be over amplified which cause high levels of Gaussian noise and/or inter-modulation which causes the base station/s capacity to severely drop or fail.|$|R

The <b>up-link</b> command <b>signal</b> is an S-Band carrier phase modulated with the frequency shift keyed (FSK) command data. The command data format is a ternary (S, 1, 0) signal. Command data rates of 1, 2, and 10 Kbps are used. The method presented uses {{direct digital synthesis}} (DDS) to generate the SGLS command data and clock signals. The ternary command data and clock signals are input to the encoder, and an FSK subcarrier with an amplitude modulated clock is digitally generated. The command data rate determines the frequencies of the S, 1, 0 tones. DDS ensures that phase continuity will be maintained, and frequency stability {{will be determined by}} the microprocessor crystal accuracy. Frequency resolution can be maintained to within a few Hz from DC to over 2 MHZ. This allows for the generation of the 1 and 2 Kbps command data formats as well as the newer 10 Kbps format. Additional formats could be accommodated through software modifications. The use of digital technology provides for encoder self-testing and more comprehensive error reporting...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1985 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaCommand Destruct Receivers {{are used}} on all launch {{vehicles}} {{for the purpose}} of initiating flight termination. The <b>up-link</b> command <b>signal</b> is a UHF carrier frequency modulated with Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) audio tones. Typically three commands are used to control and terminate the flight: ARM, DESTRUCT, and OPTIONAL command. The combination and sequence of specified IRIG tones determines the command to be issued. The decoder portion of the command destruct receiver determines the presence and sequence of IRIG tones. Through the use of a microprocessor and digital signalprocessing-technology, Cincinnati Electronics has designed and developed a digital decoder which detects four IRIG tones simultaneously. The digital decoder provides stabilities and repeatabilities unattainable with analog decoders. Reliability and reproducibility are also superior when using the digital approach through the elimination of select and variable components. This improved performance of the decoder is a result of crystal controlled digital filtering and a constant false-alarm rate provided by the microprocessor. The digital filtering is achieved through Finite Impulse Response digital filters. There are a number of additional features provided by the digital decoder. Self-testing of portions of the receiver and correcting for temperature drift can be performed by the decoder. The digital decoder can have its command sequences reprogrammed in the field allowing separate control and termination of each vehicle in a multiple vehicle launch. Also, acceptance test data, date of manufacture, total time unit has been powered up, and other data can be stored inside the Command Destruct Receiver and recalled when needed...|$|R

Most importantly, it can produce a reliable estimate of multiple access interference, whose cancellation is the main objective of multiuser detection schemes. Several schemes have been introduced for user identification in a synchronous CDMA system. The main distinguishing factor between different user identification schemes is the amount of information about each user required to be available in advance at the receiver. The existing schemes require prior knowledge of users' spreading codes or some other forms of assistance. However, the proposed method does not need the prior knowledge of the spreading codes nor relies on any assistance. Thus, using the scheme proposed in the thesis, one will be able to perform complete blind identification for a group of users. This identification involves determination of the spreading codes of active users and estimation of their relative timings. In this thesis, a scheme for blind identification of users in a chip-synchronous Direct Sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA) system is presented. The proposed approach is based on the subspace decomposition and searches for a solution that minimizes a defined cost function. The search is performed over both signal space and time domain. By completing the identification of the users, other important parameters such as user timings and power can be evaluated. Blind identification of users for an asynchronous CDMA system lends itself to several applications such as CDMA <b>up-links,</b> ad-hoc networking, <b>signal</b> interception and non-intrusive tests...|$|R
