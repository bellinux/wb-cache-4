5|$|Independent slinger {{units are}} not attested in the epigraphic {{record of the}} Principate. However, slingers are portrayed on Trajan's Column. They are shown <b>unarmoured,</b> wearing a short tunic. They carry a cloth bag, slung in front, to hold their shot (glandes).|$|E
5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, {{probably}} because {{of the success of}} infantry tactics and changes in weaponry. However, because such tactics left the knight unmounted, the role of the war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a thing of the past, replaced by lighter, <b>unarmoured</b> horses.|$|E
5|$|On 26 September 2010, Norgrove {{and three}} Afghan colleagues were {{travelling}} in the Chawkay District (also known as Tsawkay and Sawkay) of eastern Kunar Province {{when they were}} kidnapped by local insurgents. They were ambushed whilst driving on the main highway from Jalalabad to Asadabad, in the Dewagal valley, in two <b>unarmoured,</b> unmarked Toyota Corollas. A US military convoy was ambushed two months earlier on the same stretch of road. Norgrove wore a burqa to disguise her foreign appearance.|$|E
5|$|The light {{infantry}} of 1,200 velites {{consisted of}} <b>unarmoured</b> skirmishing troops {{drawn from the}} youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and buckler (90cm (3ft) diameter), {{as well as several}} light javelins, each with a 90cm (3ft) wooden shaft the diameter of a finger, with a c.25cm (10in) narrow metal point. Their numbers were swollen by the addition of allied light infantry and irregular rorarii.|$|E
5|$|The pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} in {{its heyday}} was {{the core of a}} very diverse navy. Many older ironclads were still in service. Battleships served alongside cruisers of many descriptions: modern armoured cruisers which were essentially cut-down battleships, lighter protected cruisers, and even older <b>unarmoured</b> cruisers, sloops and frigates whether built out of steel, iron or wood. The battleships were threatened by torpedo boats; it was during the pre-dreadnought era that the first destroyers were constructed to deal with the torpedo-boat threat, though {{at the same time the}} first effective submarines were being constructed.|$|E
5|$|The first dreadnoughts {{tended to}} have a very light {{secondary}} armament intended to protect them from torpedo boats. Dreadnought carried 12-pounder guns; each of her twenty-two 12-pounders could fire at least 15 rounds a minute at any torpedo boat making an attack. The South Carolinas and other early American dreadnoughts were similarly equipped. At this stage, torpedo boats were expected to attack separately from any fleet actions. Therefore, {{there was no need to}} armour the secondary gun armament, or to protect the crews from the blast effects of the main guns. In this context, the light guns tended to be mounted in <b>unarmoured</b> positions high on the ship to minimize weight and maximize field of fire.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{infantry}} of the maniples {{were supported}} {{by a number of}} light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion. The cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest class of equestrians. There was an additional class of troops who followed the army without specific martial roles and were deployed {{to the rear of the}} third line. Their role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in the maniples. The light infantry consisted of 1,200 <b>unarmoured</b> skirmishing troops drawn from the youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and a small shield, as well as several light javelins.|$|E
5|$|HMS Glatton {{was derived}} from the design of the first breastwork monitors, but sacrificed the rear turret for thicker armour and larger guns with which to attack enemy ports. She was given a deep draught to improve her seaworthiness, but her low {{freeboard}} meant that she had very little ability to weather head seas. HMS Hotspur was similar in layout to Glatton, but she was given more freeboard by the addition of an <b>unarmoured</b> structure above her waterline armour belt. Designed as a ram, Hotspur was given a fixed turret with four gun ports as a rotating turret was not thought capable of withstanding the shock of impact. HMS Rupert was an enlarged version of Hotspur, but used a Glatton-type turret instead of the fixed turret and thicker armour than the older ship. The two Conqueror-class ships were enlarged versions of Rupert with heavier guns, thicker armour and a steel hull.|$|E
5|$|Sir Stanley V. Goodall, Director of Naval Construction (DNC), {{proposed}} {{a variety of}} designs, both open and closed hangar. On 8 October 1943, the Board of Admiralty selected a closed-hangar design with an armoured flight deck and five propeller shafts. Reports of American operations in the Pacific convinced the Board to reconsider hangar design; American experience had shown {{that the ability to}} fly off all of a carrier's aircraft in a single airstrike was vital. That required a well-ventilated, open-hangar design, which would reduce the time required to launch the aircraft by allowing them to begin the typical 15-minute engine warm-up while still in the hangar. On 15 May 1944, the Board reversed itself and ordered the DNC to produce an open-hangar design with deck-edge lifts. An <b>unarmoured</b> flight deck was agreed upon in June by the Controller of the Navy and the Fifth Sea Lord.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time {{each of the four}} {{divisions}} in the 2nd AIF was authorised a cavalry reconnaissance regiment equipped with light tanks and scout carriers. While all four divisions were authorised a divisional cavalry regiment, only three regiments were eventually formed as it was believed that the 8th Division did not need armoured support in Malaya due to concerns about operating tanks in the jungle. The cavalry regiments of the 2nd AIF divisions operating in Mediterranean theatre against Italian and German forces were initially equipped with the Universal Carrier and <b>unarmoured</b> trucks before being progressively mechanised using British Army equipment, while carriers were also operated by the infantry battalions. A light armoured tracked vehicle they were armed with Bren light machine guns and Boys anti-tank rifles and were widely used by British Commonwealth forces during the World War II. Meanwhile, the Australian Tank Corps was superseded following the formation of the Australian Armoured Corps in July 1941. In October 1941 two independent light tank squadrons had been formed for service in Malaya; however, neither was deployed {{due to a lack of}} vehicles to equip them.|$|E
5|$|The {{launching}} of the steam-powered ship {{of the line}} Napoléon by France in 1850 began an arms race between France and Britain that lasted for a decade. The destruction of a wooden Ottoman fleet by a Russian fleet firing explosive shells in the Battle of Sinop, early in the Crimean War, followed by the destruction of Russian coastal fortifications during the Battle of Kinburn in the Crimean War by French armoured floating batteries, and tests against armour plates, showed the superiority of ironclads over <b>unarmoured</b> ships. France's launching in 1859 of the first ocean-going ironclad warship, the wooden-hulled , upset {{the balance of power}} by neutralising the British investment in wooden ships of the line and started an invasion scare in Britain, as the Royal Navy lacked any ships that could counter Gloire and her two sisters. The situation was perceived to be so serious that Queen Victoria asked the Admiralty if the navy was adequate for the tasks that it would have to perform in wartime. Warrior and her sister were ordered in response.|$|E
5|$|The more skin left <b>unarmoured</b> and exposed, {{the lower}} a gladiator's {{status and the}} greater his {{perceived}} effeminacy. Likewise, the engulfing net may {{have been seen as}} a feminine symbol. The light arms and armour of the retiarius thus established him as the lowliest, most disgraced, and most effeminate of the gladiator types. Helmets allowed both gladiators and spectators to dehumanise the fighters; when an arena combatant had to kill a comrade-at-arms, someone he probably lived and trained with every day, his opponent's helmet added an extra layer of separation. However, the retiarius was allowed no head protection; his face was visible to all. The emperor Claudius had all net-fighters who lost in combat put to death so that spectators could enjoy their expressions of agony. The retiariuss fighting style was another strike against him, as reliance on speed and evasion were viewed as undignified in comparison to the straightforward trading of blows. The retiarii lived in the worst barracks. Some members of the class trained to fight as Samnites, another gladiator type, in order to improve their status.|$|E
5|$|As regards cavalry, Ammianus {{mentions}} only cataphracti in {{his account}} of the battle. But it is virtually certain that they were only part of his force. In the late army as a whole, only 15% of cavalry regiments were heavily armoured cataphracti. These were suitable for the shock charge. Two tribuni (regimental commanders) of cataphracts were reported killed at Strasbourg. There were thus at least two vexillationes of cataphracts (1,000 horse) engaged. Elsewhere in Ammianus and Zosimus it is stated that Julian had a regiment of Gentiles and a regiment of scutarii under his command. Both these were normal (semi-armoured) units that represented the majority (61%) of the late army's cavalry and were best suited to mêlée combat. There is also mention of light (<b>unarmoured)</b> units of equites Dalmatae (javelineers) and equites sagittarii (mounted archers). Light cavalry was used for harassment and pursuit. The likeliest scenario is that all these were present at Strasbourg, with two vexillationes each of heavy, normal and light cavalry engaged. It is thus likely that cataphracts were about a third of Julian's cavalry at Strasbourg, an unusually high proportion. In addition, Julian had his personal escort of 200 picked cavalry. These were probably a detachment from one of Constantius' scholae (elite cavalry squadrons, believed 500-strong, that served as the imperial horse guard).|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{shortage}} of Brownings, which had been selected as the new standard rifle calibre machine gun for the RAF in 1934, early Spitfires were fitted with only four guns, with the other four fitted later. Early tests showed that while the guns worked perfectly {{on the ground and}} at low altitudes, they tended to freeze at high altitude, especially the outer wing guns. This was because the RAF's Brownings had been modified to fire from an open bolt. While this prevented overheating of the cordite used in British ammunition, it allowed cold air to flow through the barrel unhindered. Supermarine did not fix the problem until October 1938, when they added hot air ducts {{from the rear of the}} wing mounted radiators to the guns, and bulkheads around the gunbays to trap the hot air in the wing. Red fabric patches were doped over the gun ports to protect the guns from cold, dirt and moisture until they were fired. Even if the eight Brownings worked perfectly, pilots soon discovered that they were not sufficient to destroy larger aircraft. Combat reports showed that an average of 4,500 rounds were needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft. In November 1938, tests against armoured and <b>unarmoured</b> targets had already indicated that the introduction of a weapon with a calibre of at least 20mm was urgently needed.|$|E
25|$|The major clades {{were already}} {{established}} by the early Jurassic. The ornithischians divided into armoured thyreophorans and <b>unarmoured</b> ornithopods and marginocephalians.|$|E
25|$|The Defender {{has proven}} to be {{vulnerable}} to land mines and improvised explosive devices, and the army's new specification calls for optional armour. The Army Perenties are being replaced with <b>unarmoured</b> Mercedes G-Wagens.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010, the Canadian Army donated two {{disarmed}} Cougar AVGPs to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia {{for use by}} the Emergency Response Team. They were retrofitted {{to transport}} ERT assault teams into hazardous areas where transport in <b>unarmoured</b> vehicles would not be safe.|$|E
25|$|Work {{on a more}} {{advanced}} armoured fighter, conceived as an armoured version of the Sopwith Snipe, began early in 1918. The forward portion of the fuselage was a 605lb (275kg) box of armour plate, forming {{an integral part of}} the aircraft structure, protecting the pilot and fuel system, with a 0.315 in (8mm) front plate, a 0.433 in (11mm) bottom plate, 0.236 in (6mm) side plates and rear armour consisting of an 11-gauge and 6-gauge plate separated by an air gap. The rear (<b>unarmoured)</b> section of the fuselage was a generally similar structure to the Snipe’s, but flat sided, to match the forepart. The two-bay wings and tailplane were identical in form to those of the Snipe, but were strengthened to cope with the extra weight, while the fin and rudder were identical to the Snipe. The new aircraft used the same Bentley BR2 rotary engine as the Snipe, covered by an <b>unarmoured</b> cowling – the foremost armour plate forming the firewall.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, Bohemond's {{force was}} {{surrounded}} outside Dorylaeum by Kilij Arslan. Godfrey and Raymond had {{separated from the}} vanguard at Leuce, and the Turkish army attacked at dawn, taking Bohemond's army (not expecting such a swift attack) entirely by surprise, shooting arrows into the camp. Bohemond's knights had quickly mounted but their sporadic counterattacks were unable to deter the Turks. The Turks were riding into camp, cutting down noncombatants and <b>unarmoured</b> foot soldiers, who were unable to outrun the Turkish horses and were too disoriented and panic-stricken to form lines of battle. To protect the <b>unarmoured</b> foot and noncombatants, Bohemond ordered his knights to dismount and form a defensive line, and with some trouble gathered the foot soldiers and the noncombatants into {{the centre of the}} camp; the women acted as water-carriers throughout the battle. While this formed a battle line and sheltered the more vulnerable men-at-arms and noncombatants, it also gave the Turks free rein to maneuver on the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|Skirmish horse-archers, usually <b>unarmoured,</b> were {{supplied}} by the Turkic Pechenegs, Cumans and Uzes of the steppes. These troops were ideal scouts and were adept at harassment tactics. They usually attacked as a swarm and were very difficult for a more heavily equipped enemy to bring into close combat. Light horse-archers were also effective as a screening force, preventing an enemy discerning the dispositions of other troops (for example at the Battle of Sirmium).|$|E
25|$|The Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in {{the fifth}} and sixth centuries relied upon the <b>unarmoured</b> {{infantry}} supplied by their tribal levy, or fyrd, and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended. The fyrd was a local militia in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.|$|E
25|$|On {{the fifth}} day of the enquiry, {{managing}} director of Imperial Airways Colonel Frank Searle gave evidence that Imperial Airways pilots had absolute discretion to refuse to fly any aircraft if, in their opinion, the aircraft was unfit for flight for whatever reason. He stated that the petrol pipe supplied by Petro-Flex to Imperial Airways was of an armoured type, but that <b>unarmoured</b> pipes had been fitted to some aircraft taken over when Imperial Airways had been formed, and that spares from these companies were in stock and being used. Both armoured and <b>unarmoured</b> pipes had been approved {{for use by the}} Air Ministry. A representative from Petro-Flex corroborated Searle's evidence in respect of the type of piping supplied to Imperial Airways. Evidence was given that the flight from Lympne to Croydon was with the aircraft lightly loaded, and that the performance of the engine with a restricted fuel pipe would be different from that with a full load. The Chief Engineer of D. Napier & Son gave evidence that Imperial Airways maintenance regime was of the highest standard. The inquiry was then adjourned until the next day.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{contemporary}} foreign battleships and {{the preceding}} Nelson-class battleships, the King George V class had comparatively light conning tower protection with 4inches (100mm) inches sides, 3in (75mm) forward and aft and a 1.47in (38mm) roof plate. The RN's analysis of World War I revealed that command personnel {{were unlikely to}} use an armoured conning tower, preferring the superior visibility of <b>unarmoured</b> bridge positions Stability and weight considerations clearly played {{an important part in}} the British decision to limit superstructure armour. The conning tower armour was sufficient to protect against smaller ship guns and shell fragments.|$|E
25|$|The Light Fleets {{were the}} first British {{aircraft}} carriers where the ship's air group {{was seen as the}} 'main armament'; any mounted weapons were to be for close-range anti-aircraft defence. The Colossus design called for six quadruple barrelled 2 pounder gun mounts, and 16 twin Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. Two 4-inch (102 mm) guns were originally included, but an increase in the design's flight deck length in March 1942 saw them displaced. The ships were <b>unarmoured,</b> as increasing the size of the vessels was deemed more important than protection.|$|E
25|$|The true {{skirmish}} infantry, usually entirely <b>unarmoured,</b> of the Byzantine army {{were the}} psiloi. This term included foot archers, javelineers and slingers, though archers were sometimes differentiated {{from the others}} in descriptions. The psiloi were clearly regarded as being quite separate from the peltasts. Such troops usually carried a small buckler for protection and would have had an auxiliary weapon, a sword or light axe, {{for use in a}} close combat situation. These missile troops could be deployed in open battle behind the protective ranks of the heavy infantry, or thrown forward to skirmish. The light troops were especially effective when deployed in ambush, as at the Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir in 1177.|$|E
25|$|The Bible {{provides}} a famous slinger account, {{the battle between}} David and Goliath from the First Book of Samuel 17:34-36, probably written in the 7th or 6th century BC, describing events having occurred around the 10th century BC. The sling, easily produced, was the weapon of choice for shepherds fending off animals. Due to this, the sling was a commonly used weapon by the Israelite militia. Goliath was a tall, well equipped and experienced warrior. In this account, the shepherd David convinces Saul to let him fight Goliath {{on behalf of the}} Israelites. <b>Unarmoured</b> and equipped only with a sling, 5 smooth rocks, and his staff; David defeats the champion Goliath with a well-aimed shot to the head.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton {{went on to}} be Second Naval Lord in December 1888 and First Naval Lord in July 1889. In {{that role}} he was {{primarily}} concerned with implementing the recommendations contained in {{a report on the}} disposition of the ships of the Royal Navy many of which were <b>unarmoured</b> and together incapable of meeting the combined threat from any two of the other naval powers ("the Two-power Standard"): these recommendations had been enshrined in the Naval Defence Act 1889. He became President of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in September 1891 and retired from the Navy in May 1894. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 25 May 1895.|$|E
25|$|At 12:02 Yavuzs first {{artillery}} officer {{could make}} out the Russian ships through the fog and ordered the crew to target Evstafi. The first salvo overshot the ship, though one shell pierced the center funnel and caused splinter damage to the wireless antennae. The Ottomans' third salvo scored two hits on Evstafi. The first one disabled the forward starboard 6-inch casemated gun and caused casualties among its crew. The second shell penetrated the casemate armour, setting fire to some 6-inch cartridges and detonating in the officers' galley, causing severe damage while some splinters penetrated the deck and went into the boiler room below. A near miss caused extensive splinter damage to an <b>unarmoured</b> part of the ship, destroying a bulkhead in the infirmary.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Arthur William Acland Hood, 1st Baron Hood of Avalon, GCB (14 July 1824 – 16 November 1901) was {{an officer}} of the Royal Navy. As a junior officer he took part in the capture of Acre during the Oriental Crisis in 1840 and went ashore with the naval brigade at the defence of Eupatoria in November 1854 during the Crimean War. He became First Naval Lord in June 1885 and in that role was {{primarily}} concerned with enshrining into law the recommendations contained in a report on the disposition of the ships of the Royal Navy many of which were <b>unarmoured</b> and together incapable of meeting the combined threat from any two of the other naval powers ("the Two-power Standard"): these recommendations were contained in the Naval Defence Act 1889.|$|E
25|$|Experiences {{during the}} early part of the Second World War had {{demonstrated}} to the British that the Royal Navy needed access to defensive air cover for Allied fleets and convoys, which could only be provided by more aircraft carriers. In mid-1941, the Director of Naval Construction was instructed to investigate how best to achieve this without the lengthy construction times normally associated with carriers. The options were to refit the surviving Hawkins-class cruisers with flight decks and aviation facilities, convert additional merchant vessels and passenger liners into vessels similar to but more capable than previous merchant aircraft carriers, or create a new design for a cheap, lightly armed, and <b>unarmoured</b> ship similar to the Woolworth carriers. In December 1941, it was decided that a new design was the best option.|$|E
25|$|After {{promotion}} to rear-admiral on 9 June 1882, Richards was appointed Junior Naval Lord in July 1882 and then Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Station, hoisting his flag in the corvette HMS Bacchante, in May 1885. In that role he organized and equipped a naval brigade {{to support the}} British advance up the Irrawaddy River in November 1885 during the Third Anglo-Burmese War. On his return to England in June 1888, together with two other admirals, {{he was asked to}} investigate the disposition of the ships of the Royal Navy many of which were <b>unarmoured</b> and together incapable of meeting the combined threat from any two of the other naval powers ("the Two-power Standard") and to prepare the report which ultimately led to the Naval Defence Act 1889. He was also a member of a Royal Commission formed to look into Naval and Military administration.|$|E
25|$|Hood was {{appointed}} First Naval Lord in June 1885, advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 19 December 1885 and promoted to full admiral on 18 January 1886. He stood down in March 1886, just {{nine months after}} taking office, when the Marquis of Ripon {{was appointed}} First Lord of the Admiralty but was restored to his position when William Gladstone's Liberal Government fell from power in August 1886. As First Naval Lord he favoured low freeboard turret battleships and was instrumental in ensuring the Trafalgar class battleships entered service. However he was primarily concerned with enshrining into law the recommendations contained in {{a report on the}} disposition of the ships of the Royal Navy many of which were <b>unarmoured</b> and together incapable of meeting the combined threat from any two of the other naval powers ("the Two-power Standard"): these recommendations were contained in the Naval Defence Act 1889. He retired on attaining the age of sixty-five in July 1889.|$|E
25|$|Even in 1940, the Luftwaffe did {{not have}} the command {{structure}} and resources in a number of essential areas. It lacked specialised maritime aircraft designs, a staff interest in naval aviation, and possessed a commander-in-chief who was unwilling to cooperate with the Kriegsmarine. This ensured that those responsible for the direction of German strategy at that time did not immediately recognise the potential damage the Luftwaffe could do to British sea communications. The Luftwaffe command was busy replacing its losses from the Western campaign in which it had lost 28 per cent of its aircraft. Although it could still command over 1,000 medium bombers in July 1940 it did not possess many long-range aircraft or effective air-dropped torpedoes, nor was it experienced in operations against naval vessels. The short comings of the Luftwaffe in this regard were not readily apparent. The threat from German aircraft against <b>unarmoured</b> and slow merchant ships, and even warships on occasion, became apparent in the Norwegian Campaign.|$|E
25|$|In August 1917, the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) {{introduced}} the coordinated large-scale use of single-seat fighter aircraft for low-level ground-attack operations {{in support of}} the offensive at Ypres, with Airco DH.5s, which were unsuitable for high-altitude combat, specialising in this role. The tactic proved effective, and was repeated at the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917 by both DH.5s and Sopwith Camels being used in strafing attacks. While the tactic proved successful, losses of the <b>unarmoured</b> fighters proved to be extremely high, reaching up to 30% per day when aircraft were deployed in such attacks. Most losses were due to ground fire, although low-flying aircraft also proved vulnerable to attacks from above by enemy fighters. On the German side, two-seat fighters such as Halberstadt CL.II, originally designed as escort fighters, were also deployed in a similar ground-attack mission, playing {{an important role in the}} German counter-offensive at Cambrai. While the CL-type fighters were not armoured, the Germans also introduced more specialised heavily armoured two-seat aircraft such as the Junkers J.I for contact patrol and ground-attack work.|$|E
25|$|From {{the time}} of the reign of the Antonine emperors, Roman art {{increasingly}} depicted battles as chaotic, packed, single-plane scenes presenting dehumanized barbarians mercilessly subjugated by Roman military might, at a time when in fact the Roman Empire was undergoing constant invasions from external threats that led to the fall of the empire in the West. Although armed, the barbarian warriors, usually identified as Goths, are depicted as helpless to defend themselves. Various aspects of the execution of the work accentuate the contrast between the Romans and the Goths. The Roman figures are all clean-shaven and wear armour and helmets, which distinguish them clearly from the Goths, who are <b>unarmoured</b> and wear distinctive clothing, beards, and hairstyles. The Romans are given a nobler appearance with idealised physical features which contrast with the Goths who are almost caricatures, with enlarged noses, pronounced cheekbones, and wild expressions on their faces. The alternation of light/dark accentuates the contrast between the two groups. Shadows and deep carving are mostly found in the faces and hair of the Goths whereas the smooth surface of the marble is reserved for the Romans, who are less deeply carved.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish mounted archers {{attacked}} in their usual style - charging in, shooting their arrows, and quickly retreating before the crusaders could counterattack. The archers did little {{damage to the}} heavily armoured knights, but they inflicted heavy casualties on the horses and <b>unarmoured</b> foot soldiers. Bohemond had sent messengers to the other Crusader army and now struggled to hold on until help arrived, and his army was being forced back to {{the bank of the}} Thymbris river. The marshy riverbanks protected the crusaders from mounted charge, as the ground was too soft for horses, and the armoured knights formed a circle protecting the foot soldiers and noncombatants from arrows, but the Turks kept their archers constantly supplied and the sheer number of arrows was taking its toll, reportedly more than 2,000 falling to horse-archers. Bohemond's knights were impetuous - although ordered to stand ground, small groups of knights would periodically break ranks and charge, only to be slaughtered or forced back as the Turkish horses fell back beyond range of their swords and arrows, while still shooting at them with arrows, killing many of the knights' horses out from under them. And although the knights' armour protected them well (the Turks called them 'men of iron') the sheer number of arrows meant that some would find unprotected spots and eventually, after so many hits, a knight would collapse from his wounds.|$|E
