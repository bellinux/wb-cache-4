40|$|Account {{receivable}} of {{the company}} in general {{is one of the}} great of the current assets. Internal control is one of the ways of anticipating the cheating and the possibility of <b>uncollectible</b> <b>account</b> receivable. PT. Suramando is one pharmaceutical wholesaler in North Sulawesi engaged in sales of pharmaceutical goods (pharmaceuticals) and medical devices, so it has a large trade receivable. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of internal control of accounts receivable at PT. Suramando. The method used is qualitative method through the descriptive analysis. The results of the research which refers to the COSO framework on elements of internal control, shows the application of internal control {{of the company}}s trade receivables is effective. It can be seen that the company has implemented internal control elements eligible and adequate accounts receivable, supported by policies and procedures. Suggestions in this study, is that there should be control of the separation of duties between the salesman and the parts collector, and internal audit inspection function should be further improved.

Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for <b>uncollectible</b> <b>accounts</b> can {{have a significant effect}} on net income, and a company using last-in, first-out accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods.|$|R
40|$|We find {{evidence}} that {{initial public offering}} (IPO) firms, on average, have high positive issue-year earnings and abnormal accruals, followed by poor long-run earnings and negative abnormal accruals. The IPO-year abnormal, and not expected, accruals explain the cross-sectional variation in post-issue earnings and stock returns. The results are robust with respect to alternative abnormal accruals and earnings performance measures. IPO firms adopt more income-increasing depreciation policies when they deviate from similar prior performance same industry non-issuers, and they provide significantly less for <b>uncollectible</b> <b>accounts</b> receivable than their matched non-issuers. The results taken together suggest opportunistic earnings management partially explains the new issues anomaly. ...|$|R

The results taken together suggest opportunistic earnings management partially explains the new issues anomaly. Accrual accounting provides managers with discretion in the reporting of earnings. This allows financial reports to reflect managerial information about underlying economic con-ditions more accurately than is possible with a strictly mechanical reporting rule. However, if in some circumstances managers wish to mislead investors, discretion provides greater scope for obscuring true underlying firm performance. The incentives to manage earnings may be especially strong when the firm is planning to sell shares to the market, as in {{an initial public offering}} (IPO) ...|$|R
40|$|The paper uses {{existing}} Markov chain {{theory to}} analyze problem of claim payment delayed process, which serves to estimate a distribution of paid/unpaid claims after payment due. Payment condition patterns {{and timing of}} claim payments play significant role in financial management. First, the corresponding data reported in usual accounting reports are extracted to yield records of delayed payment structures. Data processing procedure issues estimations of transitions probabilities of absorption Markov chain with several transition states and two absorption ones representing paid and unpaid claims, respectively. Fundamental matrix of absorption Markov chain is calculated by matrix inversion operation and used for averaged paid/unpaid claims estimation provided a vector of pending payments distributed in transient states is given. The goal of procedure is to determine bad debt losses expected after accounts receivable are arranged by aging schedule and the payment time forbearance is given. All these calculations are illustrated on the case study analyzing after-payment-due process of accounts receivable in selected SME company from West Bohemia region. The main contribution of the paper is dependence investigation of amount of receivables and expected losses from <b>uncollectible</b> <b>accounts</b> upon variable payment time forbearance defined prospectively by financial management of the company.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "GAO reviewed the Customs Service's management of and practices for collecting civil fines and penalties (CFP) debt. GAO found that Customs' gross CFP debt more than tripled {{from the start of}} fiscal year 1997 to the end of fiscal year 2000, rising from $ 218. 1 million as of October 1, 1996, to $ 773. 6 million as of September 20, 2000. During the same period, Customs annually reserved from 75 to 87 percent of its reported CFP receivables in an allowance for <b>uncollectible</b> <b>accounts.</b> The primary reason for the growth in Customs' reported uncollected CFP debt from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2000 was the bankruptcy of a Customs broker in fiscal year 2000. The broker's bankruptcy resulted in Customs assessing 422 claims for $ 566 million and recording CFP receivables totaling $ 484 million during fiscal years 1999 and 2000. The remaining $ 82 million of assessed amounts was eliminated through the CFP mitigation process, and accordingly these amounts were not recorded as receivables. Customs can strengthen some of its CFP debt collection policies and procedures both by enhancing them and better adhering to them. The Office of Management and Budget stated that it had broad oversight responsibility for monitoring and evaluating governmentwide debt collection activities, but that it is the specific responsibility of the agency's office of inspector general to provide oversight through audits of the agency's debt collection activities. In addition, the Financial Management Service (FMS) officials stated that they rely on agencies to determine what debt should be referred to FMS for collection and offset as required by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, and Customs refers certain delinquent CFP debts to FMS for collection action. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{granting}} of credit {{is a necessary}} risk of doing business. If companies only accepted cash, sales would be negatively impacted. In a perfect world, all consumers would pay their bills when they become due. However, {{the fact is that}} some consumers do default on debt. Companies are willing to accept default risk because the value of defaults does not exceed the value of the additional sales generated. This creates an issue in regards to the valuation of <b>uncollectible</b> <b>accounts.</b> In order for a company to disclose the true value of its accounts receivable, it must establish an allowance for bad debt. Traditionally, companies estimate their bad debt expense and the related allowance for doubtful account by one of two methods: 1) As a percentage of total credit sales or 2) An aging of accounts receivable (that assesses a higher likely rate of default, the older the account becomes past due). By their very nature, these methods take into account only endogenous variables based on past experiences. For many years, the aforementioned methods of estimating bad debt were the only viable ways of determining the allowance for bad debts. However, with the explosion of technology and the easy availability of information, a more comprehensive method of determining bad debts seems appropriate. Neural network computer systems, which mimic some of the characteristics of the human brain, have been developed and may offer an alternative method for estimating the allowance for bad debt. These systems can predict what events may happen, analyze what did happen, and adjust the factor weights accordingly for the next set of event predictions. Thus, it is noteworthy to explore the use of neural networks to predict what a reasonable allowance for bad debt should be for an entity based on an array of interacting variables. Since, a neural network can incorporate both endogenous and exogenous variables one would expect to use such a system to develop a tool which gives a better estimation of the allowance for bad debt than the traditional approaches. In the current study, the findings indicate that neural networks over the balance of the time are better predictors of a company’s ending allowance for bad debt than regression. On a case by case basis, even when neural networks provide a less accurate estimate than regression, statistical analyses demonstrated the neural networks are a less volatile method and their predictions are less likely to result in a significant difference from actual allowance. Neither approach provides results that are exactly the same as the actual ending balance of the allowance for bad debt amount. Even though regression provides a more accurate estimate 45 percent of the time, this result is mitigated by two items: 1) On average, the absolute difference between actual and predicted is much lower when neural networks are used and 2) The standard deviation derived when using neural networks is only a third of the standard deviation derived from regression when applied to the absolute differences between the actual and predicted allowance...|$|R
