40|$|This paper reports {{data from}} a larger study into {{the ways in which}} Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE) {{students}} engaged in professional learning during teaching practice (TP) in Ireland. The study comprised one <b>umbrella</b> <b>case</b> study of Greendale University, schools and PETE students that consisted of five individual cases: tetrads of PETE student teacher, cooperating teacher (CT), University tutor (UT) and School Principal (SP). Each tetrad was defined as a unique community of practice located within the wider structures of school, education and university policies on teacher education. Data were collected over one academic year using qualitative research methods and grounded theory as a systematic data analysis tool. Findings indicate that in each of the five cases, support for PETE student learning was, to some degree, dysfunctional. In particular, it became evident that there were two conflicting teacher-learning curricula in operation. The official curriculum, expressed in policy and by SPs, UTs and CTs (also referred to as mentors), valued a PETE student who cared for pupils, had a rich pedagogical content knowledge, knew how to plan for and assess pupils’ learning, valued reflection, and was an active member of a community of practice. The unofficial but essentially more powerful enacted curriculum, encouraged PETE students to draw upon their own resources to learn pedagogical content knowledge in an isolated and unsupported manner. The data highlight the force of the unofficial curriculum {{and the ways in which}} PETE students were guided to the core of the dysfunctional community of practice by untrained CTs (mentors) and untrained UTs. PETE students in this study learned to survive in a largely unsupportive professional learning environment and, just as theories of social reproduction intimate, indicated that they would reproduce this practice with PETE students in their care in the future. The findings suggest that in cases similar to those studied, there is a need for teacher educators in Ireland, (in both universities and schools) to critically interrogate their personal practices and implicit theories of teacher education and to engage in training for their role. There is also evidence to suggest that PETE students in Ireland could benefit from the development of school–university partnerships that act as fundamental units of high quality professional learning. In the cases studied, this may have led to a stronger focus on the intended or official curriculum of TP, led by the revised maxim: ‘Do as we say and as we do’...|$|E

50|$|Keynes, {{in chapter}} 3 of the TP, used {{the example of}} taking an <b>umbrella</b> in <b>case</b> of rain to express the idea of {{uncertainty}} that he dealt with {{by the use of}} interval estimates in chapters 3, 15, 16, and 17 of the TP. Intervals that overlap are not greater than, {{less than or equal to}} each other. They cant be compared. Is our expectation of rain, when we start out for a walk, always more likely than not, or less likely than not, or as likely as not? I am prepared to argue that on some occasions none of these alternatives hold, and that it will be an arbitrary matter to decide for or against the umbrella. If the barometer is high, but the clouds are black, it is not always rational that one should prevail over the other in our minds, or even that we should balance them, though it will be rational to allow caprice to determine us and to waste no time on the debate.|$|R

40|$|No Identity without Temporality. Why We Need Chronologies Recently, the Dutch National History Museum {{launched}} {{a concept of}} five theme-worlds that would serve as the outline of Dutch history. Critics assume that this concept is at loggerheads with a clear chronology; in their view the museum will become a postmodern stew. This contribution investigates {{the extent to which}} this critique makes sense. One {{of the reasons for the}} critique is that the five-worlds-concept seems to abstract temporality. Indeed, in some theme-worlds different phenomena are gathered under one <b>umbrella.</b> In which <b>case</b> a coherent story with a clear temporality becomes impossible and visitors will get lost. Another reason for the critique is that the concept does not fit the temporality of national political history. There are indeed two theme-worlds which focus on climatic and social-economic processes. However, that does not contradict a chronology, it only indicates a different temporality. <br /...|$|R

60|$|There {{the little}} Chevalier {{of seven years}} old (Emmanuel Theodore was his name, {{and he is now}} a Cardinal) fell ill, and could not go on with his {{brothers}} when they were sent southwards, but was left with a lady named Flechine. By and by, when the Court came to Guienne, Madame de Flechine was afraid of being compromised if she was found to have a son of the Duke of Bouillon in the house. She recollected that there was in a very thick wood in the park a very thick bush, forming a bower or vault, concealed by thorns and briers. There she placed the little boy with his servant Defargues, giving them some bread, wine, water, a pie, a cushion, and an <b>umbrella</b> in <b>case</b> of rain, and she went out herself very night to meet Defargues and bring him fresh provisions. His Eminence has once told me all about it, and how dreadfully frightened he was a thunderstorm in the valet's absence, and when a glow-worm shone out afterwards the poor child thought it was lightning remaining on the ground, and screamed out to Defargues not to come in past it. He says Defargues was a most excellent and pious soul, and taught him more of his religion than ever he had known before. Afterwards Madame de Flechine moved them to a little tower in the park, where they found a book of the LIVES OF THE SAINTS, and Defargues taught his little master to make wicker baskets. They walked out on the summer nights, and enjoyed themselves very much.|$|R
40|$|The present work aims at {{comparing}} {{the assessment of}} umbrella pricing under US antitrust law and EU competition law {{in the aftermath of}} the landmark Kone judgment delivered by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). By {{comparing the}} reasoning of the ECJ and of the US federal courts on the availability of damages for the private plaintiffs in <b>umbrella</b> pricing <b>cases,</b> the article discusses whether umbrella pricing could represent a new example of transatlantic divergence between EU competition law and US antitrust law. The authors demonstrate that umbrella pricing claims have encountered two types of issues: while in the US the main obstacle for an umbrella pricing claim concerns the legal standing of the plaintiff, in Europe the main issue concerns the existence of a direct causal link between the anti-competitive conduct and the harm suffered by the customers of the non-cartelists. In Kone, the Court ruled that national procedural rules cannot exclude a priori an umbrella pricing claim and introduced a presumption on foreseeability of damages that cartellists would have caused to third parties. However, the Court left to the national courts the task of establishing the nexus of causality between anti-competitive conduct and harm suffered by the purchasers of non-cartellists. In the US, owing to a lack of clear guidance from the US Supreme Court, the federal courts have followed diverging approaches on this issue. In this respect * 400 the ECJ’s approach in Kone, if followed by the US courts, could represent another instance of the mutual learning process across the Atlantic in the field of competition law...|$|R
40|$|The {{communicating}} nodes in Ad-hoc {{networks are}} dynamic in nature {{in comparison with}} the traditional network nodes which appears in any fixed network infrastructure and usually Ad hoc networks are deployed in specific environment to achieve certain goals. Due to these features security challenges also increases in comparison with other traditional networks. We can say that the method used in fixed infrastructure networks cannot be directly applied in the case of Adhoc networks. So a short-range wireless channel has security problems that differ from those of more conventional networks. Vehicular Ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a subgroup of Ad hoc networks with the distinguishing property that the nodes are vehicles. This paper focuses on the security issues concerned with Vehicular Ad hoc-networks which are the most emerging forms of Ad hoc networks now days. Basically security is the main concern under the <b>umbrella</b> in the <b>case</b> of Ad hoc networks because user private data need to be protected by the authorities such that from location profiling and from other attacks on their privacy. Features like system availability and security can be achieved only with the coordination among system operators and vehicle manufacturers so that the faulty units can be identified easily...|$|R
60|$|I Have {{received}} a letter from a gentleman who is very indignant at what he considers my flippancy in disregarding or degrading Spiritualism. I thought I was defending Spiritualism; but I am rather used to being accused of mocking the thing that I set out to justify. My fate in most controversies is rather pathetic. It is an almost invariable rule that the man with whom I don't agree thinks I am making a fool of myself, and the man with whom I do agree thinks I am making a fool of him. There seems {{to be some sort of}} idea that you are not treating a subject properly if you eulogise it with fantastic terms or defend it by grotesque examples. Yet a truth is equally solemn whatever figure or example its exponent adopts. It is an equally awful truth that four and four make eight, whether you reckon the thing out in eight onions or eight angels, or eight bricks or eight bishops, or eight minor poets or eight pigs. Similarly, if it be true that God made all things, that grave fact can be asserted by pointing at a star or by waving an <b>umbrella.</b> But the <b>case</b> is stronger than this. There is a distinct philosophical advantage in using grotesque terms in a serious discussion.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} application of Stephen A. Mitchelrs Relational Matrix to personality disorders. Mitchell 2 ̆ 7 s integrated relational model has important advantages over other models when applied to the conceptualization and treatment of personality disordered individuals. The use of the DSM Axis-II categorical, atheoretical approach contributes to personality diagnoses becoming reified and the atheoretical, descriptive approach {{does not provide a}} framework from which treatment can proceed. Two theoretical models applied to personality disorders are discussed, Millon 2 ̆ 7 s Evolutionary model and Benjamin 2 ̆ 7 s Interpersonal model. These two theoretical models serve as a basis from which to examine and apply Mitchell 2 ̆ 7 s relational matrix. A major criticism of these models is that they have difficulty explaining the variations and fluctuations seenin. a person 2 ̆ 7 s personality. A major advantage of Mitchell 2 ̆ 7 s model is that it can explain both the rigidity of personality and the variations and fluctuations. In addition, the application of Mitchell 2 ̆ 7 s relational matrix to personality disorders decreases the likelihood that a personality diagnosis will become reified. This reification can become evident both in the patients view and experience ofhimlherself and in the clinician 2 ̆ 7 s view of the patient. Mit chell 2 ̆ 7 s conceptualization of multiple selves and the use of a time metaphor to capture the variations of subjective experience, decreases the likelihood that a personality disorder diagnosis will become reified. Moreover, Mitchell 2 ̆ 7 s model provides a framework that encourages an expansion in perspective for the client in viewing his or her experience. This model also decreases the likelihood that the client only sees him or herself as 2 ̆ 2 damaged. 2 ̆ 2 This framework also expands the therapist 2 ̆ 7 s view of the client in that it will alert the therapist to look for various ways the client experiences him or herself and interacts with others, beyond those that are characterized under the personality disorder <b>umbrella.</b> A <b>case</b> example is provided to illustrate the advantages of applying the relational matrix to conceptualization and treatment...|$|R
