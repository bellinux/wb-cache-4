If the soil particles in a sample are predominantly in a relatively narrow range of sizes, the sample is <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded.</b> If a soil sample has distinct gaps in the gradation curve, e.g., a mixture of gravel and fine sand, with no coarse sand, the sample may be gap graded.

A two-parameter statistical model is first proposed to describe the distribution of new particles generated from breakage of an initially <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> sample.

The two-parameter statistical model is shown {{to be able to}} capture different breakage patterns such as asperity breakage and particle splitting observed during breakage of <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> samples. In the Markov chain model, it is shown that the concept of ‘effective breakage probability’, proposed to define the relative breakage extent of the whole sample, is comparable to a well-established breakage index in the literature.

40|$|There is {{presently}} no <b>uniformly</b> accepted <b>grading</b> system for mucoepidermoid carcinoma, {{largely due to}} a lack of consensus as to what criteria should be used to formulate histological grades. The present study was undertaken to determine the relationship between histological grade, clinical stage and survival in these neoplasms. Clinical and histological data from 34 patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma were reviewed. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma was most common in the parotid gland (44. 1 %), while 25 % of patients had tumors in the minor salivary glands. Low, intermediate, and high-grade neoplasms accounted for 61. 7 %, 26. 5 %, and 11. 8 % of tumors, respectively. There was a general trend towards increasing clinical aggressiveness with increasing histological grade. Similarly, postoperative tumor recurrences were marginally more common in high-grade than in low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas. However, both of these findings were statistically insignificant, mainly due to small sample size, late clinical presentation, poor clinical follow-up, incomplete management and incomplete records. These factors explain the relatively low survival figures in the present study, as compared to higher survival figures in white patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma...|$|R

The porous structures were infiltrated with epoxy to produce composites. The porous and composite specimens were physically and mechanically characterized. Within {{the capabilities of the}} selective laser sintering machine and the materials used, porosities in the range 5 – 29 % could be obtained in a controlled, repeatable manner. The ultimate tensile strength of the produced uniformly porous polyamide structures ranged from 20 MPa (for 29 % porosity) to 44 MPa (for 5 % por-osity). The graded porous structures exhibited continuously changing porosity grades. As the number of grade incre-ments rose, the grade profile fit closely with the design grade profile. The grades need to be constructed at porosities 9 % or more for clear grade variation. Five percent porosity remained in all epoxy-polyamide composites after infiltration of the polyamide preforms with epoxy resin. Improvement in strength with epoxy infiltration was observed for preform porosities above 9 %. The composite strength varied from 37 MPa to 44 MPa with respect to epoxy resin volume fraction.

40|$|Neuroendocrine {{tumors of the}} rectum were {{regarded}} as benign, when Oberndorfer originally described the entity in 1907. Later, he acknowledged that some neuroendocrine tumors (or carcinoids, the term at that time) behave in a more aggressive manner, {{and a few of}} them even had the potential to metastasize with poor outcome. In the novel World Health Organization (WHO) classification launched in 2010, all neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are malignant. In this classification, tumors of every part of the GI tract are <b>graded</b> <b>uniformly</b> according to proliferation index and mitotic frequency, whereas the TNM-classification (tumor, node, metastasis) is specific for each site. Around 10 % of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) occur in the rectum. The tumor series comprised 73 rectal NETs, with the main objective being to study the prognostic value of the WHO 2010 classification in rectal NETs: additionally, as the WHO classification has been used for a rather short time, tumor markers were tested to find a good, reliable prognostic tool. The WHO 2010 had excellent prognostic significance; none of the G 1 - NETs (grade 1) metastasized, whereas G 2 -NETs were often disseminated, some of them at initial presentation. Metastatic NETs have a poor prognosis. Cell-cycle antigen cyclin A also correlated with prognosis, and G 2 -NETs with high cyclin A expression were all metastatic. Transcription factor prospero homeobox 1 (PROX 1) was immunohistochemically positive in a significant proportion of rectal NETs, and showed a correlation with metastatic potential and survival. It was also possible to conclude that the novel stem cell-associated factor HES 77 (human embryonic stem cell factor 77) correlated well with rectal NETs metastatic potential and prognosis. These results support the validity of the WHO 2010 classification in rectal NETs. In view of this study, for patients with a rectal G 1 -NET, one follow-up endoscopy to exclude local recurrence might suffice. Intensive follow-up does not seem indicated, as metastatic potential is very low. As to G 2 -NETs, a thorough work-up is recommended, since most of these tumors disseminate eventually, some after several years, and a standard 5 -year follow-up may not suffice. PROX 1 -positivity suggests that colorectal adenocarcinoma and rectal NET may, to some extent, share the same pathway in oncogenesis, which could lead to future therapeutic applications...|$|R

This paper {{presents the results}} of a number of drained cyclic triaxial tests on loose, <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> samples of Dogs bay carbonate sand. It is observed that particle breakage is dependent on stress level, cyclic stress ratio, and creep and is directly related to volumetric strain. Drained cycling increases volumetric strain and therefore more breakage occurs when larger numbers of cycles are imposed. The increase in particle breakage from one cycle to the next indicates that while particles may not be loaded to their full capacity in a given cycle, they can be crushed in subsequent cycles without any variation in the amplitude of cyclic loading...|$|E

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{determination of}} particle-level fabric of granular soils from tomography data requires a maximum correct separation of particles. The popular marker-controlled watershed separation method {{is widely used}} to separate particles. However, the watershed method alone is not capable of producing the maximum separation of particles when subjected to boundary stresses leading to crushing of particles. In this paper, a new separation method, named as Monash Particle Separation Method (MPSM), has been introduced. The new method automatically determines the optimal contrast coefficient based on cluster evaluation framework to produce the maximum accurate separation outcomes. Finally, the particles {{which could not be}} separated by the optimal contrast coefficient were separated by integrating cuboid markers generated from the clustering by Gaussian mixture models into the routine watershed method. The MPSM was validated on a <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> sand volume subjected to one-dimensional compression loading up to 32 MPa.

Changes to grain properties of a <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> sand specimen stemming from breakage during compression were studied with the aid of three-dimensional Synchrotron Radiation-based Micro-Computed Tomography. The fast scanning and high-resolution 4 D imaging were utilised to capture images from the interior body of the granular assembly during loading. The fractal distribution of the sand assembly showed that breakage becomes dominant in smaller grains rather than larger ones, where an increase in the amount of newly generated fine fragments leads to high coordination number surrounding the larger grains. More importantly, the results of morphological changes in the particulate assembly revealed that there is a reversal trend in the grain morphology evolution with increasing stress. The sand grains tended to create more spherical fragments with higher aspect ratio whereas by increasing the stress this trend completely shifted...|$|E

While grain interaction and contact dynamics are considered in centrifuge modelling, the soil is treated as a continuum, consistent with standard geotechnical analysis.

The current study considers the response of a granular medium in a centrifuge model by coupling physical tests and equivalent discrete element simulations.

Most variations of the Kozeny–Carman formula compute the parameter d eff based on a given conventional particle size distribution by mass (PSDm), where the validation would normally {{be carried out by}} comparing against laboratory permeability tests conducted on soils having an average coefficient of uniformity (Cu) of about 3.

This study proposes to convert the PSDm into its equivalence in surface area (PSDsa) conforming to the fundamental geometric assumption by which the Kozeny–Carman equation was originally formulated. The estimated deff based on this proposed PSDsa method appears implicitly to incorporate the size, shape and angularity of the natural grains which were traditionally represented by the shape coefficient (α). The results presented in this paper show that the suggested method is capable of predicting k for fully saturated granular soils with Cu of up 20...|$|E

In general, ballast aggregates are considered as <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded,</b> angular shaped with crushed faces.

In previous designs and modeling practices, railroad ballast has usually been treated as a homogeneous and continuous layer.

Further, continuum solutions do {{not take into account}} realistically the morphological characteristics of aggregates such as particle size distribution and shapes. A combined digital image and Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) methodology has been developed in this PhD thesis to study effects of aggregate particle size and morphological characteristics on ballast performances. The approach has been calibrated using actual ballast aggregates through laboratory shear box texts and validated by further laboratory as well as field experiments. Using the DEM ballast model, individual effects of aggregate particle size distributions and shape properties on railroad ballast strength, lateral stability, and settlement potential were studied.

This paper poses two fundamental questions {{that appear to be}} interrelated: (a) whether this stiffness property is dependent on particle size; and (b) whether the effect of testing method exists in terms of laboratory measurements using resonant column (RC) and bender element (BE) tests.

A major part of Polish road network has severely deteriorated and requires that immediate measures be undertaken to improve the safety and comfort of users. Cold In-place Recycling with Foamed Bitumen (CIR-FB) technology uses 100 % of reclaimed material by converting distressed layers into new materials for the stabilization of the subgrade and/or base courses without the need to demolish, haul and manage them. This paper presents a proposal of the reconstruction of the pavement of a road section localized in central Poland (świętokrzyskie province) using traditional and alternative materials. Cost effectiveness and ecological effectiveness of proposed technologies were compared taking into account variable load bearing capacity of the subgrade (frequent in linear construction projects), resulting from its non-uniformity. In the case analysed, due to the presence of various sands (including sand dust and same <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> sand of poor compactibility), the pavement durability was estimated based on the assumption of 50 MPa and 80 MPa subgrade bearing capacity.

40|$|Densification of soil during {{construction}} of earth structures is achieved {{through the process}} of compaction by application of mechanical energy to obtain the required engineering properties of the soil for a particular project such as hydraulic conductivity, soil strength and compressibility. These properties are dependent on attainment of high compaction densities normally achieved at specific moisture contents for a given compactive effort. The optimum moisture content and maximum dry density for a particular soil is determined by means of Proctor tests in the laboratory. A relative compaction index is then used to correlate the laboratory values with the field compaction values obtained using in-situ tests. The Sand Cone (SC) and Nuclear Density Gauge (NDG) are the common field tests used to the dry density and moisture content of the soil for purposes of quality control of the compaction process. The sand cone is a laborious test that involves excavation of part of the compacted layer and requires a 24 -hour waiting period to obtain the moisture content of the soil through the laboratory oven method. The NDG on the other hand is less laborious, however it uses a radioactive source that is a potential health hazard and therefore requires strict handling, storage and maintenance of the equipment to maintain safety standards. The Electrical Density Gauge (EDG) is an alternative in-situ test that is quicker, safer and easier to maintain since it uses electric current to measure the compaction characteristics of the soil. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the repeatability, accuracy and applicability of the EDG on South African soils by comparing its measurements for dry density and moisture content in the laboratory and in the field to the results from the sand cone and oven method. In the laboratory, a clean sand and a clayey sand were tested at the optimum moisture content and at ± 3 % of the optimum moisture content. The soils were compacted to 200 mm using the RT 74 rammer and the compaction values first tested using the EDG then followed by the sand cone test at the centre of the EDG test spot. The moisture content of the excavated sample from the sand cone test was determined using the oven method. For the field tests, the compaction characteristics of a sandy gravel and three <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> sands were tested in-situ using the EDG followed by the sand cone test. Overall, the EDG measurements were repeatable based on test-retest comparison of the paired measurements. EDG results for moisture content were consistent with the values obtained from the laboratory oven method especially in the <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> sands. However, the density measurements differed from the results of the sand cone test, which was considered the reference test for determination of field soil density. It is recommended that the EDG calibration relationship for bulk density be revised in order to improve the accuracy of the density measurements...|$|E

Hanson et al. (2010) analyzed variation in erodibility of different soil materials due to internal erosion in dams by conducting large-scale outdoor model tests. They observed that the rate of erosion in differing soil materials varied in orders of magnitude. Marot et al. (2012) used a triaxial cell device coupled with a hydraulic system to study the influence of angularity of coarse fraction grains on the internal erosion process. They concluded that the angularity of coarse fraction grains may increase the erosion resistance of the tested soils by a factor of five. Richards and Reddy (2012) performed laboratory experiments on the initiation of backward erosion in cohesive and non-cohesive soils using a triaxial test device called a true triaxial test apparatus. They observed that the primary mode of failure of non-cohesive soils was by backward erosion, which required a seepage velocity of 0.8 [*]~[*] 1.1  cm/s to initiate piping in <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> sands. Ke and Takahashi (2012) studied the mechanical effect of internal erosion on gap-graded non-cohesive soils by conducting one-dimensional seepage tests using a fixed-wall permeameter. These authors concluded that the onset of internal erosion is indicated by loss of fine material, coupled with a significant increase in hydraulic conductivity.|$|E
40|$|Mudrocks are {{indurated}} sediments widely encountered {{throughout the}} world, {{often associated with}} opencast mining activities where they are used as backfill. Opencast coal mines are frequently reinstated with substantial depths of fill to provide land for development. However, mudstones tend to change from a brittle crushable nature to a ductile clay material when inundated, causing major settlement problems when used as a fill. Three distinguishable settlement stages exist; primary compression due to immediate placement of the fill, relatively short-term but often very large strain collapse due to inundation and finally long-term creep and consolidation (Reed & Singh, 1986; Hills & Denby, 1996 and Goodwin et al., 2003). To provide a tool for engineers to predict primary and collapse settlements for large areas of mudrock fill, Rowe consolidation cell tests were conducted to analyse the influence of initial moisture content, initial particle size distribution and stress on the collapse settlement and weathering of mudrock. Triaxial isotropic tests were also conducted to investigate the stress-strain characteristics of mudrock under three states: dry, short-term inundated, and long-term. The developed predictive model was then compared with a previous model for mudrock collapse developed by Blanchfield (2000). The Rowe consolidation test results show small changes in void ratio for loading under dry conditions but drastic collapse when inundated at the same stress level. The large strains {{are believed to be}} due to the wetting of the outer part of the particles acting as a lubricant, causing the wetted particles to slide past one another allowing the soil to collapse. Under all three different soil states, {{it can be seen that}} well graded samples show less settlement compared to uniform graded samples. Results of triaxial tests show that well graded specimens always demonstrated the highest maximum deviator stress at failure regardless of the soil states of the specimens. This was followed by <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> specimens with smaller maximum particle sizes and finally the <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> specimens with larger maximum particle sizes. Higher maximum deviator stress at failure means higher load is required in order to fail the soil specimens. This trend is consistent with findings of one-dimensional compression tests· where well graded specimens always exhibited the least settlement in all soil conditions [...] It is observed, however, that the values of the maximum deviator stress appeared to decrease as the soil states changed from dry to wetted to degraded conditions. Furthermore, the dry mudrock is seen to exhibit high curved Mohr-Coulomb failure envelopes with the angle of shearing resistance values decreasing with increasing confining stress. The angle of shearing resistance decreasing from 41. 20 to 31. 30 as the mean effective stress increased from 200 to 700 kPa. This trend is consistent with findings reported by Yasufuku and Hyde (1995) who investigated pile end-bearing capacity in crushable sands. This behaviour which normally exhibited by crushable soil indicated that dry mudrock is crushable and higher effective stress application had caused more crushing to dry mudrock. Results of both Rowe consolidation tests and triaxial isotropic test suggest that the settlement behaviour of mudrock is largely affected by initial moisture content, particle size distribution and soil states.

40|$|In {{rail track}} environments, the loading system is cyclic unlike the steady seepage force that usually occurs in {{embankment}} dams. The mechanisms of filtration, interface behaviour, and time dependent {{changes of the}} drainage and filtration properties occurring within the filter medium require further research to improve the design guidelines. A novel cyclic process simulation filtration apparatus was designed and commissioned at the University of Wollongong, and a standard test procedure was established. The test apparatus was designed to simulate heavy haul train operations. The key parameters that influence the change in porosity and pore water pressure within the subballast layer under cyclic conditions in rail track environments were identified. Crushed basaltic road base {{was used as the}} filter subballast. The slurry form of the base soil, which is a low plasticity and highly erodible silty clay, was pumped {{from the bottom of the}} filter to simulate clay pumping and hydraulic erosion. Grading characteristics such as the uniformity coefficient and the mass of fines, and the external loading factors such as the maximum compressive load and slurry loading rate, were found to be the main factors that influence the mechanical characteristics and seepage hydraulics of subballasts under cyclic conditions. The evidence gathered from laboratory testing suggests that the subballast selection criteria adopted by the railway industry, which are based on mathematical and empirical models generated from static load conditions in embankment dams, does not address the filtration mechanism of subballasts under cyclic conditions. Apart from being a commonly used buffer for the ballast layer against subgrade attrition, subballast is primarily designed to act as a stress dissipation layer (capping layer) and its function as a filter is often regarded as a lesser priority. With more emphasis on the stress reduction function, well graded subballast containing larger particles provides a better skeletal resistance against applied stresses. However, well graded subballasts containing relatively coarse grains (20 % fine sand, 30 % fine gravel) are too porous to effectively Abstract vi capture the fines within its voids. Laboratory findings suggested that <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> subballasts with not more than 30 % fine sands (particle range of 0. 15 to 0. 425 mm) had an enhanced filtering capacity. Due to the lack of mechanical resistance against axial deformation, the application of cyclic stress to <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> subballasts reduces porosity and enables the filter to trap migrating fines more effectively. Moreover, this intrusion of fines changes the PSD of the subballast which reduces its porosity and further inhibits drainage. A multi-layer mathematical approach was used to predict the time dependent permeability of this filter, with (a) a reduction in porosity as a function of compression under cyclic loading, and (b) the amount of fines trapped within the filter voids, being the two main aspects of this proposed model. Laboratory test results conducted on a novel cyclic loading permeameter were used to validate the proposed model. The set of equations that forms an integral part of the proposed model is then presented as compact visual guidelines anticipated to provide a more practical tool for railway practitioners...|$|E

The new methodology proposed enable simulation of reservoir course at stipulated air voids despite details study on water levels and infiltration of porous parking lots system. A <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> choker and reservoir stones functioned as reservoir structure for temporary storm water detention. A specially fabricated water flow simulator allows laboratory simulation of the porous parking lot system. The ability to simulate 1. 24 to 59. 89 cm h - 1 rainfall intensities enable laboratory testing to verify water level and discharge time correlations with different soil infiltration rate at various rainfall intensities. The laboratory tests of vertical infiltration were conducted under conditions of saturated soils. At 59. 89 cm h - 1 simulated rainfall intensity, the highest water level recorded inside the water flow simulators body without reservoir course is 55 cm {{from the surface of}} 0. 254 cm h - 1 soil infiltration rate. A total of 80. 5 h duration was required to completely discharge the stored water between large aggregate particles due to low soil infiltration rate. Utilizing the same laterite soil as bottom layer, the depth increased by approximately 60 % after installation of reservoir course with approximately 40 % air voids. Over a 60 min duration, the soil with coefficient of permeability equaled to 25. 4 cm h - 1 had recorded water level 20 cm in height and completely dried within 32. 2 min only...|$|E
40|$|The {{horizontal}} permeability {{characteristics of}} unbound granular materials {{are important in}} many Civil Engineering applications including as filter in dams, and as unbound layers in highway pavements. In general, the gradation criteria and specification for highway base and sub-base require the aggregates to fall within a given particle-size distribution envelope. Further criteria for the unbound aggregates are the required minimum value of permeability of the aggregates. The horizontal permeability parameters of unbound aggregates {{have been identified as}} the important cause of road failures. In recent years, the cost of maintenance for such road failures has been very high. It can be reduced if we fully understand these important parameters. Two types of aggregate, namely crushed granite for base, and sand for sub-base were examined. From these specimens, three levels of gradation categories were examined: well graded, <b>uniformly</b> <b>graded</b> and gap graded. These grading were related to JKR practice and Singapore practice and also related to the mean of both codes of practices. The horizontal permeability was measured by using horizontal permeameter. This research is intended to characterise horizontal permeability of unbound aggregates in highway base and sub-base. The relative deviation, Dr, from the specified gradation envelope was measured with several new criteria. With these new criteria, their relationship to horizontal permeability of granular material was examined. On the basis of the results obtained, increasing the porosity will increase the permeability, while as increasing relative deviation, Dr, to the specification will decrease the horizontal permeability. However, by increasing the average of 10...|$|E
