500|$|In 2009, Vig and Manson met at {{the funeral}} of Pablo Castelaz, the six-year-old son of Dangerbird Records founder Jeff Castelaz, and had a {{conversation}} where, according to Vig, [...] "we felt like we had some unfinished business, and we realized how precious life is and how important music has been in our lives." [...] Manson suggested calling guitarists Duke Erikson and Steve Marker {{to get together and}} write some songs. One week later, the group informally convened in Los Angeles, where they laughed, drank, and reminisced of the old days, leaving behind the tensions among them and general weariness that was partly responsible for their 2005 breakup; they set up their equipment and [...] "started fucking around." [...] "We were all pleased to notice on the first day there just didn't seem to be any personal tensions," [...] Vig recalled. [...] "Enough time had passed that any sort of weirdness or tension that had risen between us all had dissipated. So it was easy. There was no one telling <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> We weren't signed to a label. We were between managers. So we made this on our own terms." [...] In that session, the group wrote the song [...] "Battle In Me".|$|E
500|$|As Hannah Arendt pointed out, however, (following the {{utilitarian}} John Stuart Mill on this point): a bad conscience {{does not}} necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad conscience and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self. Representing our soul or true self by analogy as our house, Arendt wrote that [...] "conscience is the anticipation of the fellow who awaits you if and when you come home." [...] Arendt believed {{that people who are}} unfamiliar with the process of silent critical reflection about what they say and do will not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can [...] "count on its being forgotten the next moment;" [...] bad people are not full of regrets. Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word consciousness from conscience. One reason, she held, was that conscience, as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like consciousness: [...] "and this conscience is also supposed to tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and what to repent; before it became the lumen naturale or Kant's practical reason, it was the voice of God." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It was 21 {{years ago}} and all I {{remember}} {{was a lot of}} people telling <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and where to put things because of all the medical jargon.

I was off to join the Royal Shakespeare Company {{for the first time and}} Casualty didn't seem that interested in asking me to stay and do any more.|$|E

2500|$|In 1955, Wilson {{acknowledged}} AA's debt, saying [...] "The Oxford Groupers {{had clearly}} shown <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> And just as importantly, {{we learned from}} them what not to do." [...] Among the Oxford Group practices that AA retained were informal gatherings, a [...] "changed-life" [...] developed through [...] "stages", and working with others for no material gain, AA's analogs for these are meetings, [...] "the steps", and sponsorship. AA's tradition of anonymity was {{a reaction to the}} publicity-seeking practices of the Oxford Group, as well as AA's wish to not promote, Wilson said, [...] "erratic public characters who through broken anonymity might get drunk and destroy confidence in us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Their first {{headlining}} tour, The Work Tour, had 27 dates. McFly's Dougie Poynter, Sandford's boyfriend played bass guitar during [...] "Just Can't Get Enough". White tripped on some wires back {{stage and}} had a foot injury, she remained seated on stage for some shows. In 2008 and 2009 the Saturdays appeared in adverts for several products including a brand of deodorant, tampons, mobile phones, an operating system, and hair removal products. The band was named as models for hair removal product, Veet. The band later became new faces of major campaign of Impulse women's deodorant. The Saturdays said that fashion is {{a huge part of}} the band, saying people look up to them as their icons. Sandford stated in an interview with Mail Online [...] "'We aren't models who can't sing. We all sing and we all dance. No one's telling <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> We're all different because we're just ourselves – and that's the way it should be." ...|$|E
2500|$|The strike begun on August 16, 1937, {{and lasted}} (as planned) till August 25. SL leaders kept {{the date of}} the {{beginning}} of the strike as top secret. In his memoirs, an SL activist from Bochnia wrote: [...] "Everything was carefully prepared. Members of Kraków's district of the party came to our village, instructing <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and how to act in case of trouble. We were told to light bonfires on August 14, as a sign that a large meeting of peasants was approaching". Rallies were organized not only in villages and towns, but also in cities. In Kraków, on Sunday, August 15, thousands of peasants with banners and orchestras gathered in the Jablonowski Square. A peasant from Bienczyce, Jakub Pszczola, gave a speech, in which he announced that the strike would begin on the next day. After his speech, leaflets were spread among those gathered, and peasants began singing their informal anthem [...] "Gdy naród do boju" [...] ("When The Nation Fights"). The leaflets informed about demands of the strikers, such as dissolution of the Parliament, release of political prisoners, change of the Constitution, and just distribution of social goods.|$|E

40|$|The quantum {{adiabatic}} {{algorithm is}} a Hamiltonian based quantum algorithm designed {{to find the}} minimum of a classical cost function whose domain has size N. We show that poor choices for the Hamiltonian can guarantee that the algorithm will not find the minimum if the run time grows more slowly than square root of N. These poor choices are nonlocal and wash out any structure in the cost function to be minimized and the best that can be hoped for is Grover speedup. These failures tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when designing quantum adiabatic algorithms. Comment: 12 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
