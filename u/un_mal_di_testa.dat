40|$|Coppa <b>di</b> <b>testa</b> is a {{traditional}} cooked pork salami produced in different Italian regions. The main raw material is deboned meat of pork head {{with the addition of}} tongue and rind. After a long (3 - 5 h) high temperature (97 °C) cooking, additives and flavourings are added and the salami is prepared. After cooling the salami is often portioned and vacuum- packaged. In this study the growth of naturally occurring contamination of Listeria innocua in three batches of vacuum packaged Coppa <b>di</b> <b>testa,</b> stored at 4 °C for 80 days, is described. The average max was 0. 24 (days- 1) and the average doubling time was 2. 87 days. The maximum growth level ranged from 4. 90 to 8. 17 (log 10 cfu/g). These results indicate that Coppa <b>di</b> <b>testa</b> definitely supports the growth of Listeria innocua in the considered storage conditions. Taking into account that at 4 °C Listeria monocytogenes strains are associated with higher grow rates than L. innocua, these results emphasize the importance of preventing Listeria monocytogenes contamination in the production stages following cooking...|$|R
