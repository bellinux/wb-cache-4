Of course I don't want you to perjure yourself; but"--and she fairly brushed him again, at their close quarters, with her fresh {{fragrant}} smile--"I do want you so to like me, and to say it all out beautifully and publicly." [...] "You want me to like you, Princess?" [...] "But, heaven help us, haven't you understood?" [...] Nothing stranger could conceivably have been, it struck him--if he was right now--than this exquisite intimacy of her manner of setting {{him down on the}} other side of an abyss. It was as if she had lifted him first in her beautiful arms, had raised him up high, high, high, to do it, pressing him to her immortal young breast while he let himself go, and then, by some extraordinary effect of her native force and her alien quality, setting him down exactly where she wanted him to be--which was a thousand miles away from her. Once more, so preposterously face to face with her for these base issues, he took it all in; after which he felt his eyes close, for amazement, despair and shame, and his head, which he had some time before, baring his brow to the mild night, eased of its crush-hat, sink to confounded rest on the <b>upholstered</b> <b>back</b> of the seat. The act, the ceasing to see, and if possible to hear, was for the moment a retreat, an escape from a state that he felt himself fairly flatter by thinking of it as [...] "awkward"; the state of really wishing that his humiliation might end, and of wondering in fact if the most decent course open to him mightn't be to ask her to stop the motor and let him down.|$|E
5000|$|A bergère is an {{enclosed}} upholstered French armchair (fauteuil) with an <b>upholstered</b> <b>back</b> and armrests on upholstered frames. The seat frame is over-upholstered, {{but the rest}} of the wooden framing is exposed: it may be moulded or carved, and of beech, painted or gilded, or of fruitwood, walnut or mahogany with a waxed finish. Padded elbowrests may stand upon the armrests. A bergère is fitted with a loose, but tailored, seat cushion. It is designed for lounging in comfort, with a deeper, wider seat than that of a regular fauteuil, though the bergères by Bellangé in the White House (one illustrated) are more formal. A bergère in the eighteenth century was essentially a meuble courant, designed to be moved about to suit convenience, rather than being ranged permanently formally along the walls as part of the decor. [...] The fanciful name, [...] "shepherdess chair", was coined in mid-eighteenth century Paris, where the model developed without a notable break from the late-seventeenth century chaise de commodité, a version of the wing chair, whose upholstered [...] "wings" [...] shielding the face from fireplace heat or from draughts were retained in the bergère à oreilles ("with ears"), or, fancifully, bergère confessionale, as if the occupant were hidden from view, as in a confessional. A bergère may have a flat, raked back, in which case it is à la reine, or, more usually in Louis XV furnishings, it has a coved back, en cabriolet. A bergère with a low coved back that sweeps without a break into the armrests is a marquise.|$|E
5000|$|The Wanganui Herald {{of the day}} {{recorded}} that [...] "the building {{which is}} of wood, resting on massive concrete foundations, all the inside walls being plastered. In size, it compares favorably with any theatre in the colony, the auditorium measuring 60 ft by 60 ft, affording seating accommodation for over one thousand persons. The dress circle and orchestral stall seats are of the latest pattern, with cast-iron frames and <b>upholstered</b> <b>backs,</b> the latter to tip up, thus giving ample room for persons to pass in front of those sitting down…" [...] The circle itself was supported from below by 18 cast iron pillars, painted to imitate marble, and which spoiled the view of patrons. Even today patrons avoid buying seats located {{too close to the}} pillars. Behind the circle was a reception and refreshment room”.|$|R
50|$|A canapé is a {{piece of}} {{furniture}} similar to a couch, and is meant to describe an elegant sofa made out of elaborately carved wood with wooden legs, and <b>upholstered</b> seats, <b>back,</b> and armrests that seats three, that emerged from France in the 18th century. A style created during the Louis XV and Louis XVI periods, similar yet different from designs used by Thomas Chippendale, it later became popular in the United States during the 19th century.|$|R
5000|$|Manufactured in a {{wide range}} of designs, the chair {{features}} an <b>upholstered</b> seat and <b>back</b> element which is supported within a base frame on a rack which permits adjustment of its inclination. The footstool is seat high, and has a base, usually wood, with a lift-off top.|$|R
50|$|The engines were {{equipped}} with a welded, high-performance boiler with a combustion chamber, roller bearings, a mixer preheater and a welded plate frame. Because great {{emphasis was placed on}} the working conditions for the engine driver and stoker, the Class 66 had a fully enclosed driver's cab, skylights, floor heating and <b>upholstered</b> seats with <b>back</b> rests. From autumn 1967 both engines were fitted equipment for working push-pull services.|$|R
50|$|The C. F. Streit Mfg. Co. was a {{furniture}} maker located on Kenner St. in Cincinnati, Ohio. Streit manufactured {{a number of}} adjustable furniture pieces, most notably the Slumber Chair which had a combination <b>upholstered</b> seat and <b>back</b> element which could be inclined at various angles. Streit also manufactured a Slumber Davenport with a fold down back which converted to a bed. The Streit Shakespeare Chair was a shallow theater chair with a flip-up upholstered seat.|$|R

50|$|In 1948, {{she founded}} the Studio de Arte e Arquitetura Palma with Giancarlo Palanti (1906-77) to design {{economical}} furniture of pressed wood or plastic manufactured by Pau Brasil Ltda., the fabrication studio they opened, and {{through which they}} furnished the São Paulo Museum of Art's first headquarters. In the 1950s, Bardi began designing metal-framed furniture with <b>upholstered</b> seats and <b>backs.</b> Later designs, such as her 1967 Cadeira Beira de Estrada (Roadside Chair), embody an unfussy aesthetic with simplicity of design and reduction and rawness of material.|$|R
50|$|The Brno chair {{has become}} a modern {{furniture}} classic. It has very clean lines, consisting of a steel frame in a single piece, bent into a C-shape {{from the middle of}} the back, round past the front edge of seat (to create arms), and back under the seat to create a cantilever, with taut seat and <b>back</b> <b>upholstered</b> in leather. There are two versions of the chair, one in tubular steel and the other in flat steel. The metal was originally polished stainless steel; some modern examples are chrome plated.|$|R
500|$|Informal, galante {{manners and}} a new half-reclining posture that {{replaced}} the former bolt-upright demeanor of court and aristocracy {{in the age of}} Louis XIV went hand-in-hand with new commodious seat furniture, developed in Paris about 1720 (illustration, right). The new Rococo chairs were upholstered à chassis, on removable frames secured by clips, so that changes from winter to summer furniture could be effected without recourse to the menuisier. [...] Off-season upholstered frames were stored in the garde-meuble. These early Louis XV chairs have <b>backs</b> <b>upholstered</b> à la reine, with the back in a flat panel that was ordinarily placed squared to the wall, so that the top-rails' curves complemented those of the boiserie panels behind them.|$|R

From left to right: a Queen Anne tub or corner chair with tapered legs (c. 1730), a Tulbach chair with ball turned legs (c. 1700), a Louis XV or Huguenot tub chair with central back splat and cabriole legs (c. 1750), and a Louis XV or Huguenot chair with caned <b>back,</b> <b>upholstered</b> seat, carved front rail and cabriole legs (c. 1780).

5000|$|Side by {{side with}} these rather {{advanced}} experiments, Jalk developed many simple sets of furniture for manufacturers, including a high desk and stool, a set of shelves in Oregon pine {{and a series of}} chairs with <b>upholstered</b> seats and <b>backs</b> on a curved steel base. Her industrially produced furniture has clear, comfortable lines. The pieces are especially well suited for quick, straightforward production schedules. Economic in their use of materials, they soon became competitive, increasing Denmark's international reputation for furniture design. Firms in the United States and Finland have manufactured some of her lines. The designs she developed for modern homes included a wall-mounted storage system (1961), a living-room set with a coffee table (1962), a [...] "Watch and Listen" [...] unit (1963) with compartments for a home entertainment system to house a stero system, TV, records, tapes and speakers. A 1960s rosewood three-piece suite made EUR 6,500 and Renato Zevi’s chrome rocking chair went for EUR 1,100, double its upper estimate. [...] Best known for her furniture design, including laminated plywood furniture for manufacturer Jeppesen, such as the side chair of 1962, and tubular steel furniture for manufacturer Fritz Henses, such as the easy chair of 1964. [...] In 1963, Jalk designed a moulded teak chair that used two pieces of plywood bent into almost impossible forms. The chair was manufactured for Poul Jeppesen, a company that would help Scandinavia become renowned for fine modern furniture.|$|R
60|$|At {{that time}} I {{used to know}} a podgy, wealthy, bald little man having {{chambers}} in the Albany; a financier too, in his way, carrying out transactions of an intimate nature and of no moral character; mostly with young men of birth and expectations--though I dare say he didn't withhold his ministrations from elderly plebeians either. He was a true democrat; {{he would have done}} business (a sharp kind of business) with the devil himself. Everything was fly that came into his web. He received the applicants in an alert, jovial fashion which was quite surprising. It gave relief without giving too much confidence, which was just as well perhaps. His business was transacted in an apartment furnished like a drawing-room, the walls hung with several brown, heavily-framed, oil paintings. I don't know if they were good, but they were big, and with their elaborate, tarnished gilt-frames had a melancholy dignity. The man himself sat at a shining, inlaid writing table which looked like a rare piece from a museum of art; his chair had a high, oval, carved <b>back,</b> <b>upholstered</b> in faded tapestry; and these objects made of the costly black Havana cigar, which he rolled incessantly from the middle to the left corner of his mouth and back again, an inexpressibly cheap and nasty object. I had to see him several times in the interest of a poor devil so unlucky that he didn't even have a more competent friend than myself to speak for him at a very difficult time in his life.|$|R
