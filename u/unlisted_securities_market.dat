40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{evolution}} of China's <b>securities</b> <b>market</b> regulation from 1980 to 2007 and the dual role of the government in this process. Design/methodology/approach – When the government is simultaneously the owner and regulator of the <b>securities</b> <b>market,</b> the evolution of <b>securities</b> <b>market</b> regulation follows a path of compulsory institutional change. China's Government authorities have played a dual role in this process by acting both as the <b>securities</b> <b>market</b> regulator and the controlling owner of the stock exchanges. The paper uses the evolution of China's <b>securities</b> <b>market</b> regulation from 1980 to 2007 to illustrate this theoretical framework. Findings – Using the case of China, this paper provides unique evidence of how securities regulation evolves in response to government direction and supervision if the government is both the owner and the regulator of the <b>securities</b> <b>market.</b> Originality/value – The paper offers insight into issues of <b>securities</b> <b>market</b> regulation in China and other emerging markets.

40|$|Chapter 4 of the Companies Act of 2008 aims to {{regulate}} offers {{to the public}} of securities and is reviewed against the principles which underscore the regulation of offerings. An overview of {{the historical development of}} the company which is parallel to the regulation of securities shows the crystallized principles which are compared against the development and enactment of the current regulatory regime. The concept of “complete law” as key element to effective regulation is discussed and applied in the review of Chapter 4 determining the effectiveness of the dispensation. The three determining concepts of regulation: the “offer,” “securities” and “public” are studied against the definitions which determine regulation and the inclusion of secondary <b>market</b> regulation of <b>unlisted</b> <b>securities.</b> Serious shortcomings in the process are identified. These errors, together with the practical problems of defining and regulating the secondary market in Chapter 4 read with the remainder of the delineating definitions, concludes that the current system is not in line with the principles of regulation and the Grundnorm of fraud prevention, resulting in Chapter 4 falling under the concept of “incomplete law” resulting in a high probability of enforcement failure and inefficiency.
