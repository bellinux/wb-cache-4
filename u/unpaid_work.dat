5|$|In {{more recent}} years {{there has been}} {{increasing}} attention to this issue, such as recognition of <b>unpaid</b> <b>work</b> within SNA reports and a commitment by the UN to the measurement and valuation of <b>unpaid</b> <b>work,</b> emphasizing care work done by women.

5|$|Efforts to {{calculate}} the true economic value of <b>unpaid</b> <b>work,</b> which {{is not included in}} measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value is enormous. In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20–50%, meaning that the true value of <b>unpaid</b> <b>work</b> is trillions of dollars per year. For other countries, the percentage of GDP may be even higher, such as the United Kingdom, where is may be as high as 70%. Because this <b>unpaid</b> <b>work</b> is largely done by women and is unreported in economic indicators, it results in these contributions by women being devalued in a society.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{potential}} of quantitative research methods for sociologists who research the gender division of <b>unpaid</b> domestic <b>work.</b> To begin, it reflects on {{the emergence of the}} sociological interest in <b>unpaid</b> domestic <b>work</b> and identifies an early core concern with making invisible work visible. It is argued that quantitative research methods provide us with the most valuable opportunities for ‘recognising’ <b>unpaid</b> domestic <b>work</b> since they facilitate larger scale representative projects. However the data in most of the large scale surveys are scant, and fail to reflect developments in the conceptualisation of <b>unpaid</b> domestic <b>work.</b> Four areas of concern to contemporary sociology are identified: domestic work practices, relationships, negotiations and meanings. Given the complex questions that these four sub- topics raise, the paper proposes a range of sub-areas as a focus for ongoing sociological research into <b>unpaid</b> domestic <b>work.</b> It is concluded that despite the methodological challenges presented, detailed indicators of the multiple dimensions of <b>unpaid</b> domestic <b>work</b> need to be agreed so that valid information can be collected as routinely in large scale surveys as are those on paid work...|$|R
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{reducing}} women's greater <b>unpaid</b> care <b>work</b> than men&'s and increasing women's paid employment, this paper examines {{the extent to which}} World Bank investments address <b>unpaid</b> care <b>work.</b> The paper conducts an in-depth gender analysis of 36 World Bank employment-related projects in Malawi, Mali, Niger, and Rwanda. It concludes that the vast majority (92 per cent) of reviewed projects fail to account for <b>unpaid</b> care <b>work.</b> Exceptionally, Malawi's Shire River Basin Management Program and Niger's Community Action Program target women's needs as caretakers.

Yet despite the considerable body of research evidence that demonstrates these clear connections, <b>unpaid</b> care <b>work</b> remains largely invisible in social protection policies and programming. In order to address this challenge, policies must recognise the value of women’s work, shift the burden of care work away from women and families and improve access to the vital services that will help improve women and girls’ wellbeing.

5|$|Feminist economists {{join the}} UN {{and others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, {{as a kind of}} work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both paid and unpaid care work. They argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household <b>unpaid</b> <b>work.</b> Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as paid work, so measures of economic success should include <b>unpaid</b> <b>work.</b> They have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the double burden in Africa {{is that there is}} class divide, meaning that most white families, {{including}} poor ones, employ Africans either as a live-in worker or a part-time worker.

5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of <b>unpaid</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|The term double burden {{arises from}} the fact that many women, as well as some men, are {{responsible}} for both domestic labor and paid labor. However, due to the thinking that a woman's time spent in domestic work is more valuable than a woman's time spent doing paid work, and that a man's time spent doing paid work is more valuable than a man's time spent doing domestic work, there is the issue of women having to do a large amount of both paid and <b>unpaid</b> <b>work,</b> leading to the double burden. Some alternative terms for double burden include : double day, second shift, and double duty.|$|E

5|$|Under communism, {{everyone}} was guaranteed employment. However, women suffered the double burden of paid and <b>unpaid</b> <b>work,</b> leading to lower birth rates. The commitment to social equality {{and the issue}} of declining birth rates allowed women to have some rights, such as child care and child allowances. For example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, their need for welfare support such as child care has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E

40|$|This review {{examines}} selected {{policies and}} {{plans of the}} Government of Bangladesh and available research in Bangladesh {{in response to the}} need to address <b>unpaid</b> care <b>work</b> - the work, mainly done by women and girls, of caring for others (often called reproductive work), at the policy level. Its purpose is to look at whether {{and the extent to which}} <b>unpaid</b> care <b>work</b> is addressed in existing national laws, Government policies and research in Bangladesh. The review was undertaken as part of a collaborative project on ‘Gender, Power and Sexuality’ involving the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) in the UK, SMERU in Indonesia, and the Centre for Gender and Social Transformation (CGST) in Bangladesh, that aims to ensure inclusion of <b>unpaid</b> care <b>work</b> on the national and global policy agendas. The findings from the review reveal that <b>unpaid</b> care <b>work</b> has primarily featured in a limited way, and mostly as background noise both at the research and policy level in Bangladesh. The search for pathways to women’s empowerment in Bangladesh has focused on women’s participation in paid work and this is reflected in both policies and research. In this regard, <b>unpaid</b> care <b>work</b> has mainly featured as a constraint to women’s participation in paid work. Although rarely addressed directly in policies or in research to date, some very recent changes indicate the creation of new spaces in policies for the emergence and recognition of <b>unpaid</b> care <b>work...</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. <b>unpaid</b> <b>work,</b> they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do <b>unpaid</b> <b>work</b> that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{suggestion}} {{by his friend}} and mentor Pedro de Córdoba, Las Casas petitioned a land grant {{to be allowed to}} establish a settlement in northern Venezuela at Cumaná. Founded in 1515, there was already a small Franciscan monastery in Spain, Cumana Mexico, and a Dominican one at Chiribichi, but the monks there were being harassed by Spaniards operating slave raids from the nearby Island of Cubagua. In order to make the proposal palatable to the King, Las Casas had to incorporate the prospect of profits for the royal treasury. He suggested fortifying the northern coast of Venezuela, establishing ten royal forts to protect the Indians and starting up a system of trade in gold and pearls. All the Indian slaves of the New World should be brought to live in these towns and become tribute paying subjects to the King. In order to secure the grant Las Casas had to go through a long fight in court against Bishop Fonseca and his supporters Gonzalo de Oviedo and Bishop Quevedo of Tierra Firme. Las Casas's supporters were Diego Columbus and the new chancellor Gattinara. Las Casas's enemies slandered him to the King, accusing him of planning to escape with the money to Genoa or Rome. In 1520 Las Casas's concession was finally granted, but it was a much smaller grant than he had initially proposed; he was also denied the possibilities of extracting gold and pearls, which made it difficult for him to find investors for the venture. Las Casas committed himself to producing 15,000 ducats of annual revenue, increasing to 60,000 after ten years, and to erecting three Christian towns of at least 40 settlers each. Some privileges were also granted to the initial 50 shareholders in Las Casas's scheme. The King also promised not to give any encomienda grants in Las Casas's area. That said, finding fifty men willing to invest 200 ducats each and three years of <b>unpaid</b> <b>work</b> proved impossible for Las Casas. In the end, he ended up leaving in November 1520 with just a small group of peasants, paying for the venture with money borrowed from his brother in-law.|$|E

50|$|<b>Unpaid</b> {{domestic}} <b>work</b> has {{a positive}} effect on a state's budget. <b>Unpaid</b> domestic <b>work</b> is typically the type of work that a state would provide for its citizens if family members were not already providing for their family. This includes things like child care, elder care, medical care, and nutrition. Because these things are being provided by an unpaid domestic worker, the state does not need to expend resources to provide its citizens with these services. Therefore, <b>unpaid</b> domestic <b>work</b> can decrease the amount of money a state must spend to otherwise provide these services. Note, however, that when a state cuts care services for the young, elderly, sick and disabled, the burden of this care is generally placed on female family members, meaning decreases in a state's spending on care can {{have a negative effect on}} female participation in the workforce.|$|R
