5|$|In AV-TEST's 2011 annual review, Microsoft Security Essentials {{came last}} in {{protection}}, seventh in repair and fifth in <b>usability.</b> In the 2012 review, it came last in protection and best in usability; however, having lost its certificate, {{it was not}} qualified for the <b>usability</b> award. In June 2013, MSE achieved the lowest possible protection score, zero.|$|E
5|$|An {{offer of}} four Type Zero {{airships}} {{was turned down}} due to doubts about their <b>usability</b> above 6,000feet and the expense of replacing the envelopes, which were estimated to have a useful life of only three months in the harsh South African sunshine.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009, AV-TEST {{conducted}} {{a series of}} trials on the final build of the product in which it detected and caught 98.44 percent of 545,034 computer viruses, computer worms and software Trojan horses as well as 90.95 percent of 14,222 spyware and adware samples. It also detected and eliminated all 25 tested rootkits, generating no false-positives. Between June 2010 to January 2013, AV-TEST tested Microsoft Security Essentials 14 times; in 11 out of 14 cases, MSE secured AV-TEST certification of outperforming AV industry average ratings. Microsoft Security Essentials 2.0 was tested and certified on March 2011. The product achieved a protection score of 2.5 out of 6, a repair score of 3.5 out of 6 and a <b>usability</b> score of 5.5 out of 6. Report details show that although version 2.0 was able to find all malware samples of the WildList (widespread malware), it was not able to stop all Internet-based attacks because it lacks personal firewall and anti-spam capabilities. In an April 2012 test, version 2.1 achieved scores of 3.0, 5.5 and 5.0 for protection, repair and <b>usability.</b> Version 4.0 for Windows 7 SP1 (x64) was tested in June 2012 and achieved scores of 2.5, 5.5 and 5.5 for protection, repair and <b>usability.</b> In October 2012, the product lost its AV-TEST certification when Microsoft Security Essentials 4.1 achieved scores of 1.5, 3.5 and 5.5 for its protection, repair and <b>usability.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plutonium–aluminium is an {{alternative}} to the Pu–Ga alloy. It was the original element considered for δ phase stabilization, but its tendency to react with the alpha particles and release neutrons reduces its <b>usability</b> for nuclear weapon pits. Plutonium–aluminium alloy can be also used as a component of nuclear fuel.|$|E
5|$|Stable {{version of}} Debian gets {{released}} approximately every 2 years. It will receive official support for about 3 years with update for major security or <b>usability</b> fixes. Point releases {{will be available}} every several months as determined by Stable Release Managers (SRM).|$|E
5|$|Several {{surveys of}} Catawissa Creek have been {{performed}} by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The first one was in 1957. There were two more surveys of chemical hydrology in 1966 and 1976. In 1997, the commission assessed the creek and its tributaries for <b>usability</b> as fisheries for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Stable is {{the current}} release and targets stable and well-tested {{software}} needs. Stable is made by freezing Testing {{for a few months}} where bugs are fixed and packages with too many bugs are removed; then the resulting system is released as stable. It is updated only if major security or <b>usability</b> fixes are incorporated. This branch has an optional backports service that provides more recent versions of some software. Stables CDs and DVDs {{can be found in the}} Debian website.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} process of Epiphany was mainly focused on numerous small <b>usability</b> improvements. The most notable {{of them was}} the new text entry widget, which first appeared in 1.8 stable version series. The new widget supported icons inside the text area reduced the amount of screen space needed to present the information and improved GNOME integration.|$|E
5|$|While FireRed and LeafGreen are remakes of Red and Green (Pokémon Green {{was only}} {{released}} in Japan, whereas the American version was Blue), they contain <b>usability</b> enhancements {{such as a}} contextual tutorial feature which allows players to look up data {{at any point in}} the game. Additionally, when continuing a saved game, players are shown the last four actions they performed, allowing them to remember what they were doing.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of new laboratory apparatus, Accum positioned himself in the middle market range with respect to cost and <b>usability.</b> Accum developed portable laboratory kits, intended for farmers, for the analysis of soils and stones. With affordable prices ranging from three to eighty pounds sterling, these chests were the first truly portable laboratories.|$|E
25|$|Usability: Aspects of the Drupal 6 {{administration}} interface were {{confusing and}} intimidating to some, particularly for new administrators. According to Dries Buytaert, Drupal 7 addressed 90% {{of the problems}} identified by <b>usability</b> tests conducted at the Universities of Minnesota and Baltimore. To achieve this, Acquia (the company founded by the project lead of Drupal) hired user experience designer Mark Boulton {{to work with the}} Drupal community to design an improved user interface for Drupal's administration interface. The majority of his team's design work has been implemented by the community in Drupal 7. The 2011 <b>usability</b> test results from the University of Minnesota Office of Information Technology show that all of the major <b>usability</b> problems identified in Drupal 6 are either vastly improved or non-existent in Drupal 7. However, some new <b>usability</b> problems were identified. Since the release of Drupal 7 there are now various distributions and applications to enhance the Back-end <b>Usability</b> of Drupal such as Drupal Gardens, Open Enterprise and Mitkom Builder.|$|E

25|$|A {{series of}} surveys were {{conducted}} throughout 2009. This {{began with a}} qualitative environment survey on MediaWiki extensions, followed by a Qualitative Statistical Survey focusing on volume of edits, number of new users, and related statistics. In March 2009, a <b>usability</b> and experience study was carried out on new and non-editors of the English Wikipedia. The aim was to discover what obstacles participants encountered while editing Wikipedia, ranging from small changes to more complicated syntax such as templates. The study recruited 2500 people for in-person laboratory testing via the Wikipedia website, which was filtered down to ten participants. The results were collated and used by the technology team to improve Wikipedia's <b>usability.</b> The <b>Usability</b> and Experience Study was followed up by the <b>Usability,</b> Experience and Progress Study in September 2009. This study recruited different new and non-editors for in-person trials on a new Wikipedia skin.|$|E
25|$|In November 2005 the OpenUsability {{project in}} {{cooperation}} with the Berlin-based Relevantive AG conducted a <b>usability</b> test of the German Wikipedia. The study focused on finding information and included a set of recommendations to change the MediaWiki interface. In February 2006, the open <b>usability</b> project led a second test which focused on the experience of new editors. The reports were published in English.|$|E

25|$|Internet {{linguistics}} is {{a domain}} of linguistics {{advocated by the}} English linguist David Crystal. It studies new language styles and forms that have arisen {{under the influence of}} the Internet and other new media, such as Short Message Service (SMS) text messaging. Since the beginning of human-computer interaction (HCI) leading to computer-mediated communication (CMC) and Internet-mediated communication (IMC), experts have acknowledged that linguistics has a contributing role in it, in terms of web interface and <b>usability.</b> Studying the emerging language on the Internet can help improve conceptual organization, translation and web <b>usability.</b> This study is intended to benefit both linguists and web users.|$|E
25|$|Although solid {{tantalum}} capacitors offered lower ESR and {{leakage current}} values than the aluminum electrolytics, in 1980 a price shock for tantalum {{in the industry}} dramatically reduced the <b>usability</b> of tantalum capacitors, especially in the entertainment industry.|$|E
25|$|Later {{versions}} of CP/M-86 made significant strides in performance and <b>usability</b> and were made compatible with MS-DOS. To reflect this compatibility {{the name was}} changed, and CP/M-86 became DOS Plus, which in turn became DR-DOS.|$|E

25|$|Polyvinylidene {{fluoride}} (PVDF) has a {{very high}} permittivity of 18 to 20, which allows large amounts of energy to be stored in a small space (volumetric efficiency). However, it has a Curie temperature of only 60nbsp&°C, which limits its <b>usability.</b> Film capacitors with PVDF are described for one very special application, in portable defibrillators.|$|E
25|$|Mobile {{search is}} {{important}} for the <b>usability</b> of mobile content for the same reasons as internet search engines became important to the <b>usability</b> of internet content. Early internet content was largely provided by portals such as Netscape. As the depth of available content grew, portals were unable to provide total coverage. As a result, Internet web search engines such as Google and AltaVista proved popular as a way of allowing users to find the increasingly specialist content they were looking for. In an international journal article, 'Exploring the logic of mobile search', Westlund, Gómez-Barroso, Compañó, and Feijóo(2011) outline a thorough review of research on mobile search usage, and also present an in-depth study of user patterns. They conclude that mobile search has started to change mobile media consumption patterns radically. They also emphasize that future developments of mobile search must be sensitive to the mobile logic.|$|E
