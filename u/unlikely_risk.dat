40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to review 32 studies on firefighters and to quantitatively and qualitatively determine the cancer risk using a meta-analysis. Methods: A comprehensive search of computerized databases and bibliographies from identified articles was performed. Three criteria used to assess the probable, possible, or <b>unlikely</b> <b>risk</b> for 21 cancers included pattern of meta-relative risks, study type, and heterogeneity testing. Results: The findings indicated that firefighters had a probable cancer risk for multiple myeloma with a summary risk estimate (SRE) of 1. 53 and 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 1. 21 – 1. 94, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SRE 1. 51, 95 % CI 1. 31 – 1. 73), and prostate (SRE 1. 28; 95 % CI 1. 15 – 1. 43). Testicular cancer was upgraded to probable because it had the highest summary risk estimate (SRE 2. 02; 95 % CI 1. 30 – 3. 13). Eight additional cancers were listed as having a “possible” association with firefighting.

These risks should have a high overall risk score (generally calculated {{as a product of}} the probability of a risk occurring and the impact if it does occur on a scale of 1 to 5).

40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} {{natural or}} induced emergence {{of infectious diseases}} have raised a debate on {{the pros and cons}} of pre-emptive vaccination of populations under uncertain risk. In the absence of immediate risk, ethical issues arise because even smaller risks associated with the vaccine are greater than the immediate disease risk (which is zero). The model proposed here seeks to formalize the vaccination decision process looking from the perspective of the susceptible individual, and results are shown in the context of the emergence of urban yellow fever in Brazil. The model decomposes the individual's choice about vaccinating or not into uncertain components. The choice is modelled as a function of (i) the risk of a vaccine adverse event, (ii) the risk of an outbreak and (iii) the probability of receiving the vaccine or escaping serious disease given an outbreak. Additionally, we explore how this decision varies as a function of mass vaccination strategies of varying efficiency. If disease is considered possible but <b>unlikely</b> (<b>risk</b> of outbreak less than 0. 1), delay vaccination is a good strategy if a reasonably efficient campaign is expected. The advantage of waiting increases as the rate of transmission is reduced (low R 0) suggesting that vector control programmes and emergency vaccination preparedness work together to favour this strategy. The opposing strategy, vaccinating pre-emptively, is favoured if the probability of yellow fever urbanization is high or if expected R 0 is high and emergency action is expected to be slow. In summary, our model highlights the nonlinear dependence of an individual's best strategy on the preparedness of a response to a yellow fever outbreak or other emergent infectious disease...|$|E
40|$|The EFSA Panel on Plant Health {{conducted}} a pest risk assessment for Burkholderia caryophylli for the EU territory under the scenario of current EU legislation and identified and evaluated risk reduction options. B. caryophylli is {{absent from the}} EU territory. The host range of B.  caryophylli includes the genus Dianthus and three other incidental, minor, hosts (statice, lisianthus and gypsophila). Seven entry pathways were identified, with carnation cuttings and cut flowers being the most frequently traded. All pathways were considered unlikely as the pathogen is rarely associated with the pathways at origin mostly {{because of the high}} phytosanitary quality of the plant propagation material. The establishment is unlikely because outdoors the environmental conditions are not favourable to the pathogen and alternative hosts are not present, whereas in protected crops the cultural practices are very effective to keep the crop free from this bacterium. Only very short-distance spread within a crop is likely, and spread between different crops is <b>unlikely.</b> <b>Risk</b> reduction options addressing the sanitary status of the propagation material have the best effectiveness and feasibility.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} different {{concepts of}} a 'warming commitment' {{which is often}} used in various ways to describe or imply that {{a certain level of}} warming is irrevocably committed to over time frames such as the next 50 to 100 years, or longer. We review and quantify four different concepts, namely (1) a 'constant emission warming commitment', (2) a 'present forcing warming commitment', (3) a 'zero emission (geophysical) warming commitment' and (4) a 'feasible scenario warming commitment'. While a 'feasible scenario warming commitment' is probably the most relevant one for policy making, it depends centrally on key assumptions as to the technical, economic and political feasibility of future greenhouse gas emission reductions. This issue is of direct policy relevance when one considers that the 2003 global mean temperatures were 0. 8 C above the pre-industrial mean and the European Union has a stated goal of limiting warming to 2 C above the pre-industrial mean: What is the risk that we are committed to overshoot 2 C? Based on the conventional IPCC uncertainty range for climate sensitivity (1. 5 C to 4. 5 C) and more recent estimates, we found that a (1) constant emission scenario is virtually certain to overshoot 2 C with a central estimate of 2. 0 C by 2100 (4. 2 C by 2400). (2) While for the present radiative forcing levels it seems <b>unlikely</b> (<b>risk</b> between 0 % and 30 %, central estimate 1. 1 C by 2100 and 1. 2 C by 2400), the risk of overshooting is increasing rapidly if radiative forcing is stabilized much above today's levels (roughly 400 ppm CO_ 2 equivalence) in the long-term. (3) From a geophysical point of view, if all human-induced emissions were ceased tomorrow, it seems 'exceptionally unlikely' that 2 C will be overshoot (central estimate: 0. 7 C by 2100; 0. 4 C by 2400). (4) Assuming future emissions according to the lower end of published mitigation scenarios provides (350 ppm CO_ 2 eq to 450 ppm CO_ 2 eq) the central temperature projections are 1. 5 C to 2. 1 C by 2100 (1. 5 C to 2. 0 C by 2400) with a risk to overshoot of 10 % to 50 % by 2100 and 1 %- 32 % in equilibrium. Furthermore, we quantify the 'avoidable warming' to be 0. 16 - 0. 26 C for every 100 GtC of avoided CO_ 2 emissions - based on a range of published mitigation scenarios. (orig.)

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Health was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on 30 pest risk assessments made by France on organisms which are considered by France as harmful in four French overseas departments, i. e. French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion. In particular, the Panel was asked whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful organisms for the endangered area of the above departments, in the meaning of the definition mentioned in Article 2. 1. (e) of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the simplified[2] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Nacoleia octasema with French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as endangered area. Nacoleia octasema Meyrick, the banana scab moth, (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is primarily a pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). In addition, it has been reported to attack, as minor hosts, Heliconia spp., Nypa fruticans (the Nypa palm), Pandanus spp. and maize. The larvae feed on the skin of the banana fruit creating black scars that may greatly reduce their market value. In some parts of its range, primarily the East Indies, it does not feed on bananas. Since no intraspecific taxonomic characteristics have been identified, it is suggested that this is due to races with different host ranges. Serious economic damage has been recorded in Queensland and Fiji. Its distribution is restricted to Australasia, south-east Asia and the Pacific islands. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [3]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 b). The pest risk assessment is short and based very strongly on the CABI Crop Protection Compendium datasheet (2001) but it does provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusions reached. The Panel agrees with the pest risk assessment which states that entry is very unlikely since the pupa is the only stage that could be transported. Any pupae in the fruit bunches are likely to be washed off and plant debris from the base of infested banana trees is very unlikely to occur with young plants. Even if the current ban on banana imports is lifted, the pest will have a very low probability of surviving the specific conditions of transport and trade with countries where the pest occurs. Imports are very unlikely since these countries are so far from the French overseas departments and home-produced fruit is readily available. Passengers are also very unlikely to carry banana fruit that might contain N. octasema the long distances from countries where the pest occurs into the French overseas departments. The Panel agrees that the potential for establishment is very high due to the similarities in climate between the pest’s current area of distribution and the French overseas departments and the abundance of suitable hosts in the PRA area[4]. The Panel agrees with the high risk rating of impacts for Guadeloupe and Martinique because of the potential loss of export markets. However, the impacts in French Guiana and Réunion, that do not have export markets, are likely to be minor. In summary, therefore, N. octasema poses a risk of high impact to Guadeloupe and Martinique and low impact to French Guiana and Réunion but the probability of the impacts occurring is very low. It is very difficult to come to a firm conclusion in situations of very low probability and high impact but the Panel agreed that, on balance, an analysis of risk management options would be appropriate because it could be used to determine whether the very <b>unlikely</b> <b>risk</b> of entry could be reduced to negligible with simple measures. The Panel therefore concludes that N. octasema does have the characteristics of a quarantine pest[5] for Guadeloupe and Martinique and that the analysis of risk management options is appropriate for these two French overseas departments. Using the terminology in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC, this means that the Panel concludes that this species is a harmful organism for Guadeloupe and Martinique and is therefore potentially eligible for listing in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC...|$|E

Findings indicate that the sources of risks in the manufacturing organizations include employees, suppliers, customers and competitors; small risks, risks that are large, and all risks that are not avoided or transferred are retained; risks are assessed and prioritized by determining the severity of loss, and probability of occurrence; Improperly assessed and prioritized risks result in waste of time dealing with risks that {{are not likely to}} occur. Risk management is simply a practice of systematically selecting cost effective approaches for minimizing the effect of threat realization to the organisation.

40|$|Abstract Background In an {{adaptive}} clinical trial (ACT), key trial characteristics may be altered {{during the course of}} the trial according to predefined rules in response to information that accumulates within the trial itself. In addition to having distinguishing scientific features, adaptive trials also may involve ethical considerations that differ from more traditional randomized trials. Better understanding of clinical trial experts’ views about the ethical aspects of adaptive designs could assist those planning ACTs. Our aim was to elucidate the opinions of clinical trial experts regarding their beliefs about ethical aspects of ACTs. Methods We used a convergent, mixed-methods design employing a 22 -item ACTs beliefs survey with visual analog scales and open-ended questions and mini-focus groups. We developed a coding scheme to conduct thematic searches of textual data, depicted responses to visual analog scales on box-plot diagrams, and integrated findings thematically. Fifty-three clinical trial experts from four constituent groups participated: academic biostatisticians (n[*]=[*] 5); consultant biostatisticians (n[*]=[*] 6); academic clinicians (n[*]=[*] 22); and other stakeholders including patient advocacy, National Institutes of Health, and U. S. Food and Drug Administration representatives (n[*]=[*] 20). Results The respondents recognized potential ethical benefits of ACTs, including a higher probability of receiving an effective intervention for participants, optimizing resource utilization, and accelerating treatment discovery. Ethical challenges voiced include developing procedures so trial participants can make informed decisions about taking part in ACTs and plausible, though <b>unlikely</b> <b>risks</b> of research personnel altering enrollment patterns. Conclusions Clinical trial experts recognize ethical advantages but also pose potential ethical challenges of ACTs. The four constituencies differ in their weighing of ACT ethical considerations based on their professional vantage points. These data suggest further discussion about the ethics of ACTs is needed to facilitate ACT planning, design and conduct, and ultimately better allow planners to weigh ethical implications of competing trial designs...|$|R

40|$|The rare {{disaster}} hypothesis {{suggests that}} the extraordinarily high postwar U. S. equity premium resulted because investors ex ante demanded compensation for <b>unlikely</b> but calamitous <b>risks</b> that they happened not to incur. Although convincing in theory, empirical tests of the rare disaster explanation are scarce. We estimate a disaster-including consumption-based asset pricing model (CBM) {{using a combination of}} the simulated method of moments and bootstrapping. We consider several methodological alternatives that differ in the moment matches and the way to account for disasters in the simulated consumption growth and return series. Whichever specification is used, the estimated preference parameters are of an economically plausible size, and the estimation precision is much higher than in previous studies that use the canonical CBM. Our results thus provide empirical support for the rare disaster hypothesis, and help reconcile the nexus between real economy and financial markets implied by the consumption-based asset pricing paradigm...|$|R
40|$|Research {{suggesting}} {{the existence of}} the accrual anomaly runs into the issue that risk serves as a competing explanation for abnormal returns. This paper proposes a novel approach to distinguish between risk and anomaly explanations for the negative association between accruals and returns. The intuition is that high risk stocks should experience relatively high and low returns more often than low risk stocks. Thus, a variable that has the opposite correlations with high returns than with low returns is <b>unlikely</b> to capture <b>risk,</b> which points toward an anomaly. The paper implements this perspective via two logistic regressions predicting relatively high and low returns. Controlling for standard risk measures, we document that low accruals increase the probability of large positive returns, but reduce the likelihood of large negative returns. This finding is inconsistent with the prediction that accruals reflect risk and supports the hypothesis that the accrual “anomaly” is indeed an anomaly...|$|R
50|$|The {{economy of}} South Korea {{is the fourth}} largest economy in Asia and the 11th largest in the world. It is a mixed economy {{dominated}} by family-owned conglomerates called chaebols, however, the dominance of chaebol is <b>unlikely</b> and at <b>risk</b> to support the transformation of Korean economy for the future generations. South Korea {{is famous for its}} spectacular rise from one of the poorest countries in the world to a developed, high-income country in just one generation. This economic miracle, commonly known as the Miracle on the Han River, brought South Korea to the ranks of elite countries in the OECD and the G-20. South Korea still remains {{one of the fastest growing}} developed countries in the world following the Great Recession. It is included in the group of Next Eleven countries that will dominate the global economy in the middle of the 21st century.|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that polymorphisms at two candidate genes that code for angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) {{are associated with}} normal cognitive ageing was tested using a sample (n = 536) of healthy 80 -year-old people who were born in 1921 and whose cognitive ability at age I I was measured in the Scottish Mental Survey 1932. Cognitive ability at age I I and age 80 was assessed using the Moray House Test. Cognitive ageing {{was defined as the}} change in IQ from age I I to 80. There was no significant association between the tested ACE and MTHFR polymorphisms and IQ score at age 11, IQ at age 80, and IQ change (all P > 0. 05). The ACE genotypes deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium proportions (P = 0. 02), which could indicate that this gene is under selection. Polymorphisms at the two studied genes are <b>unlikely</b> to be <b>risk</b> factors for normal cognitive ageing. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
