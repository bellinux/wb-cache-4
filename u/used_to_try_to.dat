5|$|Treatment of {{advanced}} forms of MS {{is more difficult}} than relapsing-remitting MS. A wide range of medications have been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> slow the progression of the disease, with results that have been at best fair.|$|E
5|$|Because DNA {{collects}} mutations over time, {{which are}} then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This {{can be used in}} studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology; For example, DNA evidence is being <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> identify the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.|$|E
5|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure, if severe or threatening vision, {{may require}} therapeutic lumbar puncture (removal of excessive cerebrospinal fluid), medication (acetazolamide), or neurosurgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting). In certain situations, anticonvulsants may be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability {{to move a}} limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E

5|$|In the Diet, {{the group}} of middle-sized states, known as Mittelstaaten (Bavaria, Württemberg, the grand duchies of Baden and Hesse, and the duchies of Saxony–Weimar, Saxony–Meiningen, Saxony–Coburg, and Nassau), {{supported}} complete demobilization within the Confederation. These individual governments rejected the potent combination of enticing promises and subtle (or outright) threats Bismarck <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> gain their support against the Habsburgs. The Prussian war cabinet understood that its only supporters among the German states against the Habsburgs were two small principalities bordering on Brandenburg that had little military strength or political clout: the Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. They also understood that Prussia's only ally abroad was Italy.|$|E
5|$|More recently, an {{alternative}} approach has been applied: rational drug design uses the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors. These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor. This new inhibitor is then <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex {{to show how the}} molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor to try to optimise binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced. Computer-based methods of predicting the affinity of an inhibitor for an enzyme are also being developed, such as molecular docking and molecular mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Research, in 2008, by {{scientists}} from Pennsylvania State University found {{high levels of}} the pesticides fluvalinate and coumaphos in samples of wax from hives, as well as lower levels of 70 other pesticides. These chemicals have been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> eradicate varroa mites, a bee pest that itself has been {{thought to be a}} cause of CCD. Researchers from Washington State University, under entomology professor Steve Sheppard in 2009, confirmed high levels of pesticide residue in hive wax and found an association between it and significantly reduced bee longevity.|$|E

25|$|In many {{countries}} around the world, waterways prone to floods are often carefully managed. Defenses such as detention basins, levees, bunds, reservoirs, and weirs are used to prevent waterways from overflowing their banks. When these defenses fail, emergency measures such as sandbags or portable inflatable tubes are often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> stem flooding. Coastal flooding has been addressed in portions of Europe and the Americas with coastal defenses, such as sea walls, beach nourishment, and barrier islands.|$|E

The Gardaí and the Irish Army were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> impede the activities of republican paramilitary groups throughout the conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles (c. 1968–1998). The paramilitaries' activities in the south included bank robberies, kidnappings and occasional attacks on the Irish security forces (killing 6 gardaí and one Irish soldier) as well as attacks on British forces over the border. Representatives of republican paramilitaries were forbidden from appearing on television or radio by Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, (1971).|$|E
25|$|The {{goals of}} {{treatment}} are to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may {{be helped by}} balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, {{or the use of}} assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Irish {{authorities}} were again party to a settlement, the Good Friday Agreement, which set up power-sharing institutions within Northern Ireland, North-South instructions and {{links between the}} various components of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.

Even {{in the wake of}} the post-Good Friday Agreement incorporation of the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin into electoral politics, there remain several republican paramilitary groups who wish to use force to destabilise Northern Ireland – such as the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA.
