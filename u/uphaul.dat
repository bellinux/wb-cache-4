25|$|Mastering this {{technique}} is imperative when sailing in high winds or in large swell, when uphauling the sail would be difficult or impossible. It is also necessary when sailing on smaller boards, when the board {{does not have enough}} buoyancy for the sailor to stand on it with enough stability to <b>uphaul</b> the sail.|$|E
25|$|A waterstart {{is a key}} windsurfing {{maneuver}} for recovering after a {{fall and}} getting back into sailing position by using wind. It is more efficient than uphauling the sail (standing {{on the board and}} lifting it by the rope, or <b>uphaul),</b> but requires a minimum level of wind to perform. Variations of waterstarting include the clew-first waterstart and the light wind waterstart.|$|E
50|$|The {{topping lift}} (more rarely {{known as an}} <b>uphaul)</b> is a line which applies upward force on a boom on a sailboat.|$|E

25|$|Waterstarting {{is faster}} and less tiring {{compared}} to climbing {{back on the}} board and <b>uphauling</b> the sail, but requires enough wind (about 14 knots or more, depending on the skills, weight and agility of the surfer) to perform. Waterstarting requires flying the sail and getting the mast high enough so that the wind will finish in lifting the sailor's weight up and onto the board.|$|R

5000|$|Having {{remembered to}} insert a skeg this time, Drake added a lanyard (now called an <b>uphaul)</b> {{by which he}} could stand up and haul his own sail out of the water. Returning to Marina del Rey two weeks later, Drake was {{impressed}} enough by the improved prototype to allow Hoyle to arrange a launch party for what they had called the [...] "Skate." ...|$|E
50|$|The cockpit {{itself is}} 7 ft long. Standard racing crew on the mutt is two, but for day sailing the Mutt has a maximum {{capacity}} of 4 people. The Mutt {{can also be}} rigged for single-handing for those with enough experience. The deck is white with a green or yellow hull. Ronstan and Harken hardware comes standard on Nickels Mutineers. The Mutineer 15 {{is equipped with a}} cunningham, boomvang, and jib <b>uphaul</b> system. Depending on the model there is either foam flotation (older) or fully sealed air tanks (Nickels Mutineers) to provide additional flotation.|$|E
50|$|Treffry {{repeated}} {{the technique of}} inclined plane tramways to connect Par Consols mine, located on high ground to the north-west of Par Harbour. It was 870 ft (265 m) long on a gradient of 1 in 7. Although {{the bulk of the}} traffic was downhill, coal had to be brought up to the mine head, and {{it was not possible to}} bring leats to the location, so that Treffry had to install a steam engine (rather than a water wheel) to power the <b>uphaul.</b> The tramway started work in 1841.|$|E
5000|$|Fall Recovery. The rider climbs {{onto the}} board, grabs the pulling rope (<b>uphaul),</b> makes sure the mast foot is between two feet, pulls the sail {{about one third}} out of the water, lets the wind turn the sail-board {{combination}} till he/she has the wind right in the back, pulls the sail all the way out, places the [...] "mast hand" [...] (hand closest to the mast) on the boom, pulls the mast over the center line of the board, places the [...] "sail hand" [...] (hand furthest from the mast) on the boom, then pulling on it to close the sail and power it.|$|E
5000|$|Fall Recovery: In {{strong winds}} it is {{difficult}} to <b>uphaul</b> the sail (pulling it out of the water while standing on the board) so waterstarting is necessary. This is done (while water treading) by positioning the mast perpendicular to the wind, lifting the luff out of the water to allow the wind to catch the sail, and then having the sail pull the sailor onto the board. As the sail becomes powered, it is then trimmed to bring the rider, board, and sail back onto a plane. Occasionally a rider may be unable to waterstart if the wind has dropped. If this happens the rider can wait for a gust and [...] "pump" [...] the sail {{to get back on the}} board. If this becomes hopeless uphauling the sail will be necessary.|$|E
