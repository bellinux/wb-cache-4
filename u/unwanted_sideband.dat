Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the <b>unwanted</b> <b>sideband</b> it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained.

50|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} 8VSB for broadcasters {{is that it}} requires much less power to cover an area {{comparable to that of}} the earlier NTSC system, and it is reportedly better at this than the most common alternative system, COFDM. Part of the advantage is the lower peak to average power ratio needed compared to COFDM. An 8VSB transmitter needs to have a peak power capability of 6 db (four times) its average power. 8VSB is also more resistant to impulse noise. Some stations can cover the same area while transmitting at an effective radiated power of approximately 25% of analog broadcast power. While NTSC and most other analog television systems also use a vestigial sideband technique, the <b>unwanted</b> <b>sideband</b> is filtered much more effectively in ATSC 8VSB transmissions. 8VSB uses a Nyquist filter to achieve this. Reed-Solomon error correction is the primary system used to retain data integrity.|$|E

Calibration vectors can be parameterized in a way that avoids the need for a full two-dimensional (LO and intermediate frequency) measurement matrix. Quantization errors introduced by the digitizer do not degrade sensitivity and sideband suppression as long as the random noise rms voltage is at least 5 sample intervals. The spurious response from the first LO harmonic is about 30 dB down from the fundamental so a switchable low-pass filter at the signal input may be required for operation of the mixer over an LO tuning range greater than about a 1. 8 : 1. ...|$|E
40|$|Josephson effect mixers have {{previously}} been observed to display 'excess' noise both in experiments with point contacts and in numerical simulations using the resistively shunted junction (RSJ) model. This excess noise causes the mixer noise temperature to {{be a factor}} of typically 20 - 100 times the physical temperature of the device. Previously, this excess was ascribed to conversion from <b>unwanted</b> <b>sidebands</b> of the local oscillator and Josephson frequencies and their harmonics. Our numerical modeling of the RSJ equations has led to a new understanding of the excess noise, which is simply due to the intrinsic Josephson oscillations of the device. In addition, we have extended the modeling to include the previously ignored case of finite device capacitance (i. e. RSJ capacitance parameter beta(sub c) does not equal 0, which is more realistic for lithographically defined Josephson such as shunted tunnel junctions or SNS bridges. For some cases, this yields an improvement of a factor of two in noise temperature from the zero capacitance models. We will discuss the device parameters which optimize the mixer performance for frequencies approaching the characteristic frequency of the device, which is given by the Josephson frequency at the I(sub c) R(sub n) voltage (nu = 2 eI(sub c) R(sub n) /h). These modeling results predict good conversion efficiency and a noise temperature within a factor of a few of the physical temperature. Experiments are in progress to determine the accuracy of this modeling using a waveguide mixer at 100 GHz with optimized, resistively shunted Nb tunnel junctions. If the modeling results are valid, they are particularly encouraging for mixers in the submillimeter regime, given the possibility of obtaining non-hysteretic Josephson devices with I(sub c) R(sub n) products in excess of a millivolt, using for instance, high-T(sub c) SNS bridges. We discuss the modifications to the classical RSJ model which are necessary in the quantum regime (h nu greater than kT), and conclude the Josephson mixers may attain noise temperatures less than ten times the quantum limit at high frequencies...|$|R

This laboratory work was conducted to design a system for stabilizing and controlling the frequency of a 2 K 25 klystron. A functional schematic diagram of the system is presented in Figure 1. If the electrical lengths shown by the dotted and full lines of Figure 1 are made equal, the system will be broad-band in frequency. This broadband feature was considered to be the primary feature recommending the system. Stabilization and control of the oscillator over a 30 mcps range with fixed mechanical tuning was achieved. However, the broad-band nature of the stabilized system was not realized in operation. The amplifier output modulates the oscillator signal at Crystal A in Figure 1. the upper-sideband is passed through the cavity and mixed with the oscillator signal at Crystal B for detection. The lower-sideband must be suppressed to prevent its travelling through the waveguide path which does not include the cavity, to Crystal B for detection. Two waveguide assemblies were devised to accomplish this suppression. Neither one was too successful in this respect. Developments of the resultant system of this laboratory work that may be profitable are: a) using a reflection type cavity and both side-bands as in the Found-Saffarano method of stabilization, b) use the conversion of cavity phase-shift to amplifier frequency-shift in measurements, c) improve the waveguide assemblies of this thesis to suppress the <b>unwanted</b> <b>sideband,</b> d) employ this stabilization method in an F.

30|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{there is a}} growing demand for the high speed data rate services, but which cannot be {{supported}} by existing congested frequency spectrum. To overcome the spectral congestion and support future traffic demands, use of  MM-Wave frequency band has been proposed. The MM-Wave band ranging from 30 to 300  GHz provides huge bandwidth (BW) of about 270  GHz, due to this abundant BW it can be used in future wireless communication and space communication to provide long-distance ultra-capacity services [1 – 3]. However, one of the major issues of the MM-Wave communication is the generation and transmission since electrical generation of such high frequency signal is very troublesome process. Hence optical MM-Wave generation and RoF transmission methods have been proposed. Though there are several methods of optical MM-Wave generation techniques, external modulation based optical frequency multiplication techniques have gained much attention due to its higher modulation bandwidth, stability and flexibility [4 – 7]. Several optical frequency upconversion/multiplication techniques have been demonstrated with different frequency multiplication such as four, six, eight, ten and twelve [8 – 16]. Aforementioned techniques have utilized external modulation with optical carrier suppression (OCS) for the better <b>unwanted</b> <b>sideband</b> suppression using Lithium Niobate –Mach-Zehnder Modulators (LN-MZM). Similarly, such a OCS phenomenon can also be achieved using phase modulators (PM) with higher modulation index [17]. The OCS based frequency multiplication will greatly improve RoF transport systems due to its dispersion tolerance. However, MM-Wave generation with higher frequency multiplication factors play major role in limiting the need for high frequency electronic RF LOs at the Central Station. But, single MZM cannot provide sufficient flexibility to select and generate the desired higher order optical sidebands and hence several series parallel configuration have been utilized to achieve high frequency multiplication factors. Hasan et al. have utilized array of four phase modulators to generate frequency octupling and 24 tupling [18]. Recently, several frequency 16 - tupling techniques have been demonstrated using two cascaded MZMs with two tunable lasers [19], dual parallel MZMs [20], two cascaded dual parallel MZMs [21], and dual stage cascaded MZMs [22]. The modulation indices of these schemes are very high and used complex circuit arrangements. The higher modulation indices will have low conversion efficiency. Moreover, RFSSR and OSSRs of the proposals [19 – 21] are low. Hence in this paper, a cascaded combination of four MZMs is utilized to reduce the modulation index and improve the optical and RF sideband suppression ratios.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} RF CMOS circuits required for integrated transceivers, including a downconversion mixer, an image-rejection upconversion mixer and a Q-enhanced LC bandpass filter. The downconversion mixer has a simple architecture consisting of a cross-coupled pair and two source-followers as the core. The mixing property is superior due to the characteristics of unbalanced source-coupled pairs. It is also insensitive to both device mismatches as well as body effect. Independence {{of the first two}} poles allows the input and output bandwidth to be optimized separately. Both downconversion and upconversion mixers have been fabricated in a 0. 8 μm CMOS process. Experimentally, the downconversion mixer achieves an input bandwidth of 1 GHz at which IIP 3 of 23. 5 dBm is measured. Its conversion loss and 1 -dB compression point are measured to be 4. 4 dBm and 14. 5 dBm, respectively. It occupies an active die area of 100 μm x 100 μm, and consumes 2. 5 mW from a single 2. 6 V supply. The image-rejection upconversion mixer is formed by a parallel connection of two identical mixers which have a similar architecture as the downconversion one. The image-rejection property is a consequence of selectively canceling the signals in the <b>unwanted</b> <b>sideband.</b> Within the input bandwidth of 600 MHz, the measured gain mismatches between individual channel is less than 1 dB with a conversion gain of - 11 dB. At this frequency, the l-dB compression point is 11 dBm, and the IIP 3 is 22. 5 dBm. It dissipates 20 mW from a 3. 3 V power supply. Its active area is 290 μm X 150 μm. The classical LC bandpass filter is implemented in CMOS technology using lossy monolithic inductors. It has a fully differential structure with a tunable quality factor using negative resistances and a variable centre frequency based on Miller capacitances. The filter's centre frequency can be varied from 820 MHz to 930 MHz with an adjustable Q-factor up to 880 in the post-simulation. The simulated peak conversion gain is 42 dB. The IIP 3 is - 38 dBm when the Q-factor is 650 and the centre frequency is 900 MHz. Its nominal supply voltage is 3 V with a current consumption of 40 mA, and it occupies an active area of 740 μm x 840 μm...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new predistortion lineariza-tion scheme for single sideband mixers {{to be used}} for removing unwanted harmonics and intermodulation products of the digital intermediate frequency (IF) in an heterodyne transmitter. The proposed algorithm called poly-harmonic predistortion lineariza-tion relies on an orthogonal expansion in the frequency domain of the nonlinearities for the mixer modeling. It takes into account memory effects which are piece-wise quasi-memoryless and enables the independent cancellation of <b>unwanted</b> spurious <b>sidebands</b> of the digital IF harmonics. The poly-harmonic pre-distortion linearization scheme for the weak-nonlinear regime was implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and experimentally investigated for the linearization of a 4 -path polyphase single sideband upconverter. The ability of the poly-harmonic predistortion algorithm to linearize the 4 -path polyphase mixer for input signals with high envelope fluctuation is demonstrated. - 70 dBc/- 62 dBc/- 60 dBc spurious rejection and 18 dB/ 10 dB/ 8 dB linearization improvement of the 3 rd order distortions are achieved for a two-tone RF signal, a 64 -tone 10 MHz bandwidth multisine signal and OFDM signal respectively.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this chapter}} we discuss {{flexible}} cognitive radio circuits for dynamic access of unused spectrum. Ideally, such circuits can work at an arbitrary radio frequency (RF). We review techniques to realize radios {{without resorting to}} frequency selective dedicated filters, in particular a recently proposed polyphase multipath technique canceling harmonics and sidebands [11, 12]. Using this technique, a wideband and flexible power upconverter with a clean output spectrum can be realized on a CMOS chip, aiming at flexible radio transmitter applications. Prototype chips can transmit at an arbitrary frequency between DC and 2. 4 GHz. <b>Unwanted</b> harmonics and <b>sidebands</b> are more than 40 dB lower then the desired signal up to the 17 th harmonic of the transmit frequency. Such polyphase multipath circuits need flexible multi-phase clocking with a large frequency range and low phase errors. We will compare a Shift Register (SR) to a Delay Locked Loop (DLL) for multi-phase clock generation, and motivate why a SR is not only more flexible but often also better [16]. For a given power budget, we show that a SR almost always generates less jitter than a DLL, assuming both are realized with current mode logic. This is {{due to differences in}} jitter accumulation and the possibility to choose latch delays in a SR much smaller than the delays of DLL elements. For N-phase clock generation, a SR also functions as a divide-by-N and requires a VCO with N times higher frequency. However, this does not necessarily lead to more power consumption and can even have advantages like higher Q and less area for the inductors...|$|R
