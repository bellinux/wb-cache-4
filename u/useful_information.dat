5|$|The {{sources for}} this war are mostly of Byzantine origin. Foremost among the {{contemporary}} Greek texts is the Chronicon Paschale by an unidentified author from around 630. George of Pisidia wrote many poems and other works that were contemporary. Theophylact Simocatta has surviving letters {{along with a}} history that gives the political outlook of the Byzantines, but that history only really covers from 582 to 602. Theodore the Synkellos has a surviving speech, which was made during the Siege of Constantinople in 626, that contains <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> for some events. There are some surviving papyri from Egypt from that period.|$|E
5|$|Travelogues of {{contemporary}} foreign travellers have provided <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> about the Chalukyan empire. The Chinese traveller Xuanzang {{had visited the}} court of PulakeshinII. At {{the time of this}} visit, as mentioned in the Aihole record, PulakeshinII had divided his empire into three Maharashtrakas or great provinces comprising 99,000 villages each. This empire possibly covered present day Karnataka, Maharashtra and coastal Konkan. Xuanzang, impressed with the governance of the empire observed that the benefits of the king's efficient administration was felt far and wide. Later, Persian emperor KhosrauII exchanged ambassadors with PulakeshinII.|$|E
5|$|X-rays are {{generally}} filtered (by use of X-Ray Filters) {{to a single}} wavelength (made monochromatic) and collimated to a single direction before {{they are allowed to}} strike the crystal. The filtering not only simplifies the data analysis, but also removes radiation that degrades the crystal without contributing <b>useful</b> <b>information.</b> Collimation is done either with a collimator (basically, a long tube) or with a clever arrangement of gently curved mirrors. Mirror systems are preferred for small crystals (under 0.3 mm) or with large unit cells (over 150 Å).|$|E

5|$|Although {{most of the}} {{writings}} that have survived from this period are religious in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular writing was also popular in the imperial court. Some of these writings carry <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> on urban life, grandeur of the imperial and provincial courts, royal weddings and ceremonies. Other works refer the general town planning, fortifications and ordnance details at Vijayanagara and other important cities, irrigation reservoirs, merchants and shops dealing {{in a variety of}} commodities. On occasion, authors dwell on mythical cities that reflect their idealised views on contemporary life. Commonly found in these works are description of artists and professionals and their relationship with the court. These included poets, bards, composers, painters, sculptors, dancers, theatrical performers and even wrestlers. Others who find mention are political leaders, ambassadors, concubines, accountants, goldsmiths, moneylenders and even servants and door keepers.|$|E

Kilo begins to remember his secret past: he learns that Denham led a Eurocorp team to kill his parents and abduct him as a baby because he has genes ideal for becoming an agent. Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of Eurocorp's agents were abducted as children and their memories were modified so they would remain loyal to Eurocorp. Lily created the DART 6 chip, hoping {{to use it to}} make the syndicates retain their humanity and care about both chipped and un-chipped civilians, but she realizes she was naïve to think that way.|$|E
5|$|Early in the game, {{the player}} is {{provided}} with a personal data assistant (PDA). PDAs contain security clearance levels, allowing the player to access certain areas that are otherwise locked and off-limits. Additionally, the PDA {{can be used to}} read e-mails and play videos that the player's character acquires during the game. Whenever the player picks up any of the other PDAs found throughout the game, its contents are automatically downloaded to the player's own device. Other PDAs often contain e-mails and audio logs for other characters, which can provide <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> such as storage or door key codes, as well as significant plot details.|$|E

Although General deBeauharnais {{was convinced}} of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, {{he was concerned about}} his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents. Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near Neustadt; he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality deBeauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> about Prussian troop movements.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} may {{be studied}} {{by a variety}} of techniques, including both direct and indirect observations. Two experimental techniques that have proved very useful in this area of study are field ion microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. By visualizing the displacement of atoms or clusters over time, it is possible to extract <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> regarding {{the manner in which the}} relevant species diffuse-both mechanistic and rate-related information. In order to study surface diffusion on the atomistic scale it is unfortunately necessary to perform studies on rigorously clean surfaces and in ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions or in the presence of small amounts of inert gas, as is the case when using He or Ne as imaging gas in field-ion microscopy experiments.|$|E
5|$|When the United States entered World War I, Truman {{rejoined the}} National Guard; he helped recruit new {{soldiers}} as his unit expanded, and his success led {{the men of}} his battery to elect him as their first lieutenant. Before deployment to France, Truman was sent for training to Camp Doniphan, Fort Sill, near Lawton, Oklahoma when his regiment was federalized as the 129th Field Artillery. The regimental commander during its training was Robert M. Danford, who later served as the Army's Chief of Field Artillery. Truman later said he learned more practical, <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> from Danford in six weeks than from six months of formal Army instruction, and when Truman later served as an artillery instructor, he consciously patterned his approach on Danford's.|$|E

5|$|In Barden and Grimaldi's article, {{the authors}} could not {{sufficiently}} identify the ant with enough confidence {{to place it}} in a subfamily. Instead, it was incertae sedis within the Formicidae. Although a recent published morphological study provided <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> on the mouthparts of basal ants, placing Cretaceous taxa is still difficult. However, synapomorphies (key diagnostic traits) {{could have been used}} to attempt to place Zigrasimecia. Key synapomorphies for Sphecomyrmine ants include scape (the base segment of the antenna) length; petiole (narrow waist between the thorax and abdomen); and the metapleural gland (secretory glands), as indicated by Barry Bolton's diagnosis. The morphology of Z. tonsora shows a variety of autapomorphies (derived traits) not seen in any other ant species, particularly the structure of the mandibles and mesosomal sculpturing. Another issue in placing Z. tonsora is that the status of Sphecomyrminae had rarely ever been evaluated (perhaps once) via phylogenetic methodology. Due to this, it was possible that the subfamily was not monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA tests available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.|$|E
