5|$|Dendritic cells {{bridge the}} {{innate immune system}} and {{adaptive}} immune system. They are increased in psoriatic lesions and induce the proliferation of T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Targeted immunotherapy as well as psoralen and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>A</b> (PUVA) therapy can {{reduce the number of}} dendritic cells and favors a Th2 cell cytokine secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell cytokine profile. Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to induce the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>A</b> (UVA) {{radiation}} {{is in the}} wavelength range 320 to 400nm. It is present more uniformly throughout the day, and throughout the year, than UVB. Most UVA is not blocked by the atmosphere's ozone layer. UVA causes the release of existing melanin from the melanocytes to combine with oxygen (oxidize) to create the actual tan color in the skin. It is blocked less than UVB by many sunscreens, but is blocked to some degree by clothing. UVA is known both to cause DNA damage and to be carcinogenic. However, it operates not by inducing direct DNA damage, but by producing reactive oxygen species which damage DNA indirectly. UVA (see above) induces a cosmetic tan but little extra melanin protection against sun damage, sun burn, or cancer.|$|E

500|$|Solar urticaria, {{due to its}} {{particular}} features, {{is considered to be}} a type of physical urticaria or light sensitivity. Physical urticaria arises from physical [...] factors in the environment, [...] which in the [...] case of solar urticaria is [...] UV radiation or light. SU may be classified based on the wavelength of the radiative energy that causes the allergic reaction; known as Harber's classification, six types have been identified in this system. Type I solar urticaria is caused by UVB (ultraviolet B) radiation, with wavelengths ranging from 290–320nm. Type II is induced by UVA (<b>ultraviolet</b> <b>A)</b> radiation with wavelengths that can range from 320–400nm. The wavelength range of type III and IV spans from 400 to 500nm, while type V can be caused by UVB radiation to visible light (280–600nm). Type VI has only been known to occur at 400nm.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To assess S. aureus {{in vitro}} {{viability}} after {{the exposure to}} <b>ultraviolet</b> light <b>A</b> (UVA) and riboflavin (B 2). METHODS: Samples of S. aureus in 96 well plates (in triplicate) were exposed to riboflavin (B 2) and <b>ultraviolet</b> light <b>A</b> (365 nm wavelength) at a power density of 3 mW/cm², 8 mm spot diameter, for 30 minutes. Control groups were prepared as well in triplicate: blank control, <b>ultraviolet</b> light <b>A</b> only, riboflavin only and dead bacteria Control. The bacterial viability was measured using fluorescent microscopy. In order to investigate the occurrence of "viable but non-culturable" microorganisms after treatment, the cell viability was also investigated by plate culture procedure onto a broth medium. Statistical analysis was performed using the triplicate values from each experimental condition. RESULTS: No difference was observed among the treatment group and the control samples (p= 1).

5000|$|Psoralen and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>A</b> {{phototherapy}} (PUVA) {{combines the}} oral or topical administration of psoralen with exposure to <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>A</b> (UVA) light. The {{mechanism of action}} of PUVA is unknown, but probably involves activation of psoralen by UVA light, which inhibits the abnormally rapid production of the cells in psoriatic skin. There are multiple mechanisms of action associated with PUVA, including effects on the skin's immune system. PUVA is associated with nausea, headache, fatigue, burning, and itching. Long-term treatment is associated with squamous cell carcinoma (but not with melanoma).

50|$|Exposure to <b>ultraviolet</b> {{light is}} <b>a</b> concern. In {{the early days}} of photocopiers, the {{sensitizing}} light source was filtered green to match the optimal sensitivity of the photoconductive surface. This filtering conveniently removed all <b>ultraviolet.</b> Currently, <b>a</b> variety of light sources are used. <b>As</b> glass transmits <b>ultraviolet</b> rays between 325 and 400 nanometers, copiers with ultraviolet-producing lights such as fluorescent, tungsten halogen, or xenon flash, expose documents to some ultraviolet.|$|R
50|$|Ultraviolet light (UVA) {{treatments}} are normally {{carried out in}} a hospital clinic. Psoralen and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>A</b> light (PUVA) treatment involves taking a drug that increases the skin's sensitivity to ultraviolet light, then exposing the skin to high doses of UVA light. Treatment is required twice a week for 6-12 months or longer. Because of the high doses of UVA and psoralen, PUVA may cause side effects such as sunburn-type reactions or skin freckling.|$|E
50|$|Photoreceptors, {{similar to}} those found in the retina of the eye, detect {{potentially}} damaging ultraviolet radiation (<b>ultraviolet</b> <b>A</b> specifically), inducing increased production of melanin by melanocytes. Thus tanning potentially offers the skin rapid protection from DNA damage and sunburn caused by ultraviolet radiation (DNA damage caused by ultraviolet B). However, whether this offers protection is debatable, because the amount of melanin released by this process is modest in comparison to the amounts released in response to DNA damage caused by ultraviolet B radiation.|$|E
