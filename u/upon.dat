5|$|Reptile's Fatalities in Mortal Kombat II {{consist of}} {{revealing}} his reptilian face {{in order to}} devour the opponent's head, or turning invisible and severing the opponent's torso. Later finishing moves expand <b>upon</b> the concept, ranging from regurgitating acid <b>upon</b> the opponent to leaping <b>upon</b> their body and gnawing the flesh from their skulls. In a series retrospective, the Mortal Kombat development team named Reptile's finishers as some of their favorites from the series.|$|E
5|$|Responses to {{the ruling}} were divided with a {{significant}} number of commentators focusing <b>upon</b> the erosion of Miranda, and others commenting <b>upon</b> the impact of the case on terrorism suspect interviews—a topic where Congress had recently attempted to legislate.|$|E

5|$|Although {{conclusive}} evidence might be wanting either way for whether Hebrew Law allowed for impalement, or just hanging, the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement {{as seen in}} the carvings could, perhaps, equally easily be seen as a form of hanging <b>upon</b> a pole, rather than focusing <b>upon</b> the stake's actual penetration of the body.|$|E

5|$|Curium has {{peculiar}} magnetic properties. Whereas {{its neighbor}} element americium shows no deviation from Curie-Weiss paramagnetism {{in the entire}} temperature range, α-Cm transforms to an antiferromagnetic state <b>upon</b> cooling to 65–52 K, and β-Cm exhibits a ferrimagnetic transition at about 205 K. Meanwhile, curium pnictides show ferromagnetic transitions <b>upon</b> cooling: 244CmN and 244CmAs at 109 K, 248CmP at 73 K and 248CmSb at 162 K. The lanthanide analogue of curium, gadolinium, {{as well as its}} pnictides, also show magnetic transitions <b>upon</b> cooling, but the transition character is somewhat different: Gd and GdN become ferromagnetic, and GdP, GdAs and GdSb show antiferromagnetic ordering.|$|E
5|$|HMS Drake was {{the lead}} ship of her class of {{armoured}} cruisers built for the Royal Navy around 1900.
