50|$|When {{concrete}} on streets, parking lots, or warehouse floors {{begins to}} degrade, {{there are a}} few methods of repair available. Concrete <b>undersealing</b> is a process by which hot asphalt is pumped underneath the concrete slab so it flows into patches that were hollow and eroded. After concrete <b>undersealing,</b> the concrete is more stable and can be overlaid with a thin layer of asphalt to repair cracks, saving the expense and time of replacing the entire surface.|$|E

50|$|Historically a bitumen-based {{compound}} was used, {{but after}} approximately a decade this becomes brittle and water can become trapped between the <b>underseal</b> and body metal, ironically {{creating a more}} favourable environment for rust than if no <b>underseal</b> was applied at all. Wax-based <b>underseals</b> do not have this disadvantage but can be eroded and eventually washed off by enthusiastic use of a hot pressure washer. Rubber-based <b>underseals</b> are also sometimes used.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{for sale}} in some territories are not <b>undersealed,</b> because the climate is not {{sufficiently}} aggressive to warrant it. If such a vehicle is subsequently imported into a country with high rainfall, cold winters and where salting of the roads is common, application of <b>underseal</b> is strongly recommended to ensure the vehicle has a long life.|$|R
50|$|In the factory, car {{bodies are}} {{protected}} with special chemical formulations, typically phosphate conversion coatings. Some firms galvanize part {{or all of}} their car bodies before the primer coat of paint is applied. If a car is body-on-frame, then the frame (chassis) and its attachments must also be rustproofed. Paint is the final part of the rustproofing barrier between the body shell (apart from on the underside) and the atmosphere. On the underside, an <b>underseal</b> rubberized or PVC-based coating is sprayed on. These products will be breached eventually {{and can lead to}} unseen corrosion that spreads underneath the <b>underseal.</b> Old 1960s and 1970s rubberized <b>underseal</b> can become brittle on older cars and is particularly liable to this.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{determine}} the optimal hole pattern needed for <b>undersealing</b> work, and also to determine if it is feasible to underseal a roadway with existing longitudinal subdrains without plugging the subdrain system. At the test site the hole pattern had little effect on the grout distribution. It was found that the hole pattern, to be effective, must locate existing voids and that holes must extend at least 2 in. (5 cm) below the underside of the pavement. It appeared that pavements can be undersealed without significant damage to the existing subdrains, but special care is needed to assure that excess grout is not injected into the drainage system. Recommendations are made concerning the hole pattern, grout efflux time, and procedures for minimizing the risk of plugging the subdrains with grout...|$|E
40|$|The report {{presents}} {{an overview of}} processes and products which are used in auto repair shops, and describes the existing possibilities of implementing cleaner technologies or best available techniques for avoiding or reducing emissions and environmental impacts. Auto repair shops produce noise, waste and wastewater and contribute to air pollution primarily {{from the use of}} volatile organic solvents (VOC) through <b>undersealing</b> of cars and painting of cars, but VOCs are also emitted from degreasing agents, filling agents and glue. Wastewater from auto repair shops may have a high content of oil, heavy metals and other hazardous substances. The amount of waste from auto repair shops may be large and could consist of many types of hazardous waste. Also, there is a significant risk of soil pollution from oil and heavy metals. Cars themselves and many car maintenance products, spare parts and other materials used in auto repair shops contain substances which from an environmental and health point of view are particularly concerning. These substances are of significance to health and safety, and are emitted to the environment not only from the auto repair shops, but also from cars being used and when they are scrapped...|$|E

5000|$|Aftermarket [...] "underseals" [...] {{can also}} be applied. They are {{particularly}} useful in high-impact areas like wheel arches. There are two types - drying and non-drying. The hardening and drying products are also known as [...] "Shutz" [...] and [...] "Anti Stone Chip" [...] with similar potential problems to the original factory <b>underseals.</b> These are available in black, white, grey and red colors and can be overpainted. These are best used for the area below the bumpers on cars that have painted metal body work in that location, rather than modern plastic deep bumpers. The bitumen based products do not dry and harden, so they cannot become brittle, like the confusingly named [...] "Underbody Seal with added Waxoyl" [...] made by Hammerite, which can be supplied in a Shutz type cartridge labelled [...] "Shutz" [...] for use with a Shutz compressor fed gun.

5000|$|Colors and {{treatments}} {{applied to the}} panels from the factory should be considered. Although more original looking, period enamel or cellulose paint will be less capable of protecting the car bodywork than modern paints. A car's owner may wish to have a panel or portion of the car entirely painted when in fact it {{may have come from}} the factory with undercoating or other coating applied to one side, which may be less attractive than a smoothly finished and painted panel. In other cases, the owner might paint or plate a collection of small parts to look similar for a better appearance, when the factory might have installed these as many different colors, since the factory's prime concern was a balance between function and cost and not the appearance of unseen areas. Given the cost of restoration it makes sense to many owners to upgrade the corrosion protection of paints, <b>underseals</b> and anti-rust waxes to far above the original factory standard to protect the time and money invested in the restoration. Some owner's feel these improvements would make the car a [...] "Restomod", and not a restoration. The term [...] "Restomod" [...] is not used in the UK.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} miles of portland cement {{concrete}} pavement in Iowa {{that due to}} normal wear, {{and in some cases}} accelerated wear from studded tires, the surface has become polished resulting in less than desirable friction values. Retexturing the surface may be an economical way to re-establish desirable friction values. Retexturing by grinding with diamond blades and transverse grooving with diamond blades are two methods of rehabilitating p. c. c. surfaces. MU Inc. of Lebanan, Tennessee proposed to provide without charge to the Iowa Department of Transportation, one 1500 ft x 12 ft section each of three methods of texturing. They are longitudinal grinding, transverse grooving and longitudinal grinding followed by transverse grooving. A section of 1500 feet is needed to properly evaluate a texturing method. It was decided by Iowa DOT personnel that due to possible differential friction it would be undesirable to texture only one lane. The decision was made to do test sections of 1500 ft x 24 ft with the cost of the additional texturing paid by the Iowa DOT. Iowa also has areas where the p. c. c. pavement has faulted at the joints and cracks which results in poor riding quality. Methods of correcting the faulting are to <b>underseal</b> the pavement where needed and/or grinding the surface to eliminate the faulted areas. It was decided to include in this research project a section for profiling by grinding...|$|R
50|$|Body shells {{are painted}} in a semi-clean {{environment}} using solvent-based paint. Shells are dipped in chemical tanks to cleanse them of any oils {{picked up on}} the panels during their manufacture in Body Shop. Once bodies have been dipped and cleansed, they are then immersed in an anti-corrosion paint dip called ED (Electrocoat Dip). This 'dip' coats the entire body, both inside and outside, and is the first paint coating it will receive. Once the 'dipped' body has been stoved in the ED oven, the body progresses to the 'Sealing' Booth. In this booth, the body has its interior panel joints, floor, tailgate, hood and door edges sealed with a PVC based sealant, to prevent water ingress and corrosion as the car is driven on the road. Also within this zone, sound pads are added to the floor and boot to reduce road noise (standard practice in the motor industry). The next booth it enters is the 'Underbody' Booth. In this booth, similar to 'Sealing' Booth, the body's wheel arches are sealed using the same PVC based sealant. Robots then apply the <b>underseal</b> to the underfloor and wheel arches. Also robots are used to apply the SGC (Stone Guard Coat) layer to the sills: this coating is designed for abrasion resistance, i.e. preventing stone chips, scuffs, etc. From here, the body proceeds into the Undercoat Oven. The next zone is 'ED Sanding' booth where the body is inspected for any minor imperfections received in the ED Coat. The next zone is the 'Surfacer' Booth, where the body receives its second coat of paint, this being the Surfacer Coat, then into the Surfacer Oven. Next is 'Surfacer Sanding' Booth: the same as ED Sanding, this zone inspects the body for any imperfections picked up within the Surfacer coating. Next comes the 'Topcoat' Booth, where the body receives its final coats of paint, these being Topcoat and Clearcoat layers. After being stoved in the Topcoat oven, the body then enters the 'Touch-up' Booth where the body has its final inspection for any imperfections picked up in the Topcoat process. Once the body leaves here, it then moves on to the PBS (Painted Body Store) above Trim and Chassis to await {{the next step in the}} production process.|$|R
40|$|On the {{concrete}} surfacing monitoring {{section of the}} federal motorway A 5 from Darmstadt to Heidelberg, {{set up by the}} Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) in 1968, short slabs (5 m) were built for the first time without surfacing reinforcement and without running joints. In 8 test sections, each 3 kilometres long, the type of roadbase (bituminous roadbase, concrete roadbase with and without bituminous intermediate layer) and the thickness of {{the concrete}} surfacing (22 and 25 cm) varied. The monitoring section has been subjected to very heavy traffic for almost 30 years - roughly since 1989 in accordance with the building class SV. In cooperation with the BASt, the long-term behaviour of the different construction methods was to be investigated. Larger areas with a very poor condition were not found. The condition of an additional section subjected to the investigation, which was built using the usual construction methods - with 7. 5 metres-long, reinforced, 22 -cm-thick slabs was the worst (larger distortion tensions, greater joint movements). The 25 -cm-thick concrete surfacing was well suited for carrying the traffic load up to now. The 22 -cm-thick concrete surfacing of the traffic lane already had to be <b>undersealed</b> during {{the first few years of}} use. The test results confirm the necessity of the increased requirements placed on the erosion-resistance of roadbases under concrete surfacing in recent years in technical regulations. Not only the bituminous roadbase but also the concrete surfacing (equivalent to an HGT with #beta#_D> 15 N/mm" 2) did not display any damage, and in general it is still attached to the concrete surfacing. The bituminous intermediate layer which was used is not suitable. The investigations show that the condition of the individual sections depends not only on the composition, but also the camber, the point in time and the carrying out of the reapir work, the consistency of the joint, the efficiency of the dowelled joints and anchoring, and also the quality of the construction work and the concrete.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to combine petrophysical and geochemical data in order to {{reconstruct}} the migration history and pathways of mixed microbial-thermogenic gases drilled on the Nile Delta fan, offshore Egypt. While general interest lies in understanding migration routes, rates and mechanisms special attention is dedicated to understanding (1) the origin of gas in both reservoir and non-reservoir units using chemical and isotopic fingerprints and (2) whether a free gas phase supports relatively rapid leakage via bulk flow in non-reservoir units, both above and below commercial accumulations. The Pilocene section in this study is a classic slope environment comprising channels, mud-rich turbidites, mass transport complexes and hemipelagites. Data from seismic and drilled wells suggest that the channel and levee reservoirs are rarely full to spill, implying either a lack of charge and leakage rates which precludes complete filling of the structures. The provided data set enables a quantitative assessment of gas distribution and its genetic fingerprint in the context of both stratigraphic position and lithology. Data is reported from 25 wells, each provided with a conventional wireline log suite and some with borehole images and high-quality core images. Gas concentration data, plus compositional and isotope data are available for isotubes and headspace gas for both reservoir and non-reservoir units. Small-to-medium scale linear and non-linear depth shifts between different techniques (core recovery, core logging, wireline logging) in conjunction with scale and resolution issues demanded logical/stochastic depth synchronisation and well as harmonisation of signal resolution (typically up-scaling). Accordingly, great care was taken to depth-match core, log and gas data. In general, there is evidence of leaking thermogenic and partly biodegraded gas from the reservoirs under investigation, while some microbial methane appears to be retained in the cap rock. Careful assessment of the maturity of the thermogenic gas charge suggests that in a given structure, maturities are similar throughout the sampled section of <b>underseal,</b> reservoir and top seal. Furthermore, compositional temperature stratification suggests a balance between influx of fresh gas and microbial metabolism rates, supporting the concept of a dynamic charge-leak scenario that is sustaining hydrocarbon fermenting microbial communities in the deep biosphere. It was found that microbial recycling of hydrocarbons at depth enables the identification of diffusive gas mixing pathways in the combined analysis of methane and ethane compositional and isotopic data. The proposed diffusion pattern supports the idea of a widely present coupling between both methanogenic and biodegrading microbial communities that exhibit strong carbon isotopic dis-balances at gas-water contacts (GWC) where nutrient supply is in favour of the biodegrading metabolism. Although the hypothesis of coupled diffusive/microbial gas overprints complies with (1) various literature reports that microbial attack on free gas phases is hindered by restricted physical access and (2) segregative isotope fractionation as a consequence of differences on methane and ethane diffusivity, it is conditional to the nature of gas mixing patterns along borehole trajectories in the context of lithology and pore fluid saturations. Undoubtedly, the ubiquitous presence of microbial gas has consequences for vertical net leakage. As classic empirical wireline models for hydrocarbon saturation (i. e. free gas phase volumetrics) are not suited for clay-dominated cap rock sections, an alternative approach presented in this study is based on total gas (TG) modelling from nuclear logs and its solubility in the formation of brine. The calibrated saturation model is scale-independent and implies that free gas occurs on the most of the clay-dominated non-reservoir sections. However, model resolution is not sufficient to capture the suspected filamentary network of free gas phase within the mudrock pore space that enables relatively rapid leakage via Darcy flow. In an unique attempt to validate manual and thereby subjective lithofacies allocations to core images a subset of rock sample properties such as grain size fractions and porosity were successfully modelled using quantitative core image properties. However, model validity appears to be restricted to clay-rich lithofacies due to both an absence of calibration data for sands and occurrence of abnormally dark sandstone units. Further, an artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to propagate the calibrated core fancies along the entire wireline logged borehole section to set the lithological context for a detailed fluid flow analysis. Reproducibility of input (core) facies by output (wireline) facies is similar to the reproducibility by fellow geoscientists but could not be significantly improved to 60 - 80 % of reliability by reduction of facies types. The study shows that a combination of geochemical data with lithological and petro-physical information generates detailed insights into rates, mechanisms, and pathways of two phase flow through the deep biosphere of gas-charged basins. Vertical, geologically rapid flow through mud-rich sequences is a viable migration route for gas if the influence of cap rock bypass systems (permeable faults, sandstone intrusions, mud volcanoes etc.) is restricted. It was found that an adequate quantification of both thermogenic gas fraction and diffusive gas mixing fingerprints is crucial to identity stratigraphic intervals that are not dominated by advective leakage through the pore space and are consequently bypassed.
