40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} {{relationship}} between workplace equality and the technology of egg freezing, which allows women to “bank” their eggs <b>until</b> they are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> them. As the workplace increasingly rewards education and career investment, middle class women postpone family formation until they have attained a measure of financial security and the maturity to balance dual earner arrangements. Yet, as they age, their reproductive potential diminishes dramatically. By contrast, women who do not complete college (and aren’t even thinking about graduate school) bear children at different times in their life cycles, with less leverage with employers, and different understandings about the appropriate tradeoffs between work and family, fathers and mothers, single and dual-parenting. The article contrasts egg freezing’s enormous potential benefits to individual women (and their partners) against the potential dangers. Once egg freezing takes hold as a valuable – and viable – option, pressures are likely to build {{to make it a}} routine one. A fertility industry eager to enhance its market share may well push its services without comprehensive assessment of the potential risks to the health of women and children. Moreover, the availability of egg freezing may make it that much harder to marshal coalitions to push for more family friendly workplaces. It is accordingly likely to exacerbate existing cultural, regional, and class divisions. The result of technological advances in egg freezing will further marginalize those on the losing end of today’s economy, reinforcing the growing disparity between families based on class. We predict that the overall effect will be to slow the needed remaking of workplace and family systems to better accommodate a changing relationship between work and family and reinforce the diverging socioeconomic status and socializations of elite and working-class women. Ultimately, the cultural dilemmas inherent in egg freezing show the need to develop new models of success: for working class women, this means educational and employment opportunities that encourage them to delay childbearing, and for elite women, this means opportunities that foster earlier childbearing...|$|R

40|$|How do I safely {{handle a}} turkey prior to cooking? Safe, minimal {{handling}} and thorough cooking {{will help to}} ensure turkey is safe to eat. After purchasing a turkey, refrigerate (at 4 °C / 40 °F or less) or freeze it (at or below – 18 °C / 0 °F) immediately (Food Safety and Inspection Service, 2003). Plan to use a fresh turkey within 2 days of purchase (Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency, 2002). Remove the giblets (heart, liver and gizzard) and store the turkey in a covered container in the refrigerator <b>until</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> Whole turkeys can be frozen for one year. Complete thawing prior to cooking is a critical step in turkey safety no matter which thawing method is chosen (Lacroix, Li & Powell, 2003). Thawing the turkey in the refrigerator ensures the temperature at {{the surface of the}} bird does not rise above 4 °C while the center thaws. Leaving the plastic wrap on the turkey, place it on a large enough tray or container to catch any raw juice drippings. Place the turkey in the refrigerator. Make sure the raw juices will not contaminate other foods in the refrigerator, especially raw vegetables stored in the crisper under the bottom shelf. Allow 10 hours per kilogram (5 hours per pound) to thaw completely (Canadian Food Inspection Agency, 2002). When thawing the turkey at room temperature (23 - 27 ºC), leave the turkey covered in the plastic wrap or place in a leak proof food grade plastic, or remove the plastic wrap and thaw directly in the roasting pan. A safe way to thaw a turkey at room temperature is to over wrap the plastic with a number of layers of newspaper (approximately 8) (Lee, 1993). This provides an insulating blanket for more even thawing. Make sure that the raw juices do not run on the counter. Do not leave smaller turkeys (4. 7 kg; 10 lb) thawing at room temperature for more than 12 hours or larger turkeys (11. 9 kg; 26 lb) for more than 18 hours (Lee, 1993). Cook immediately. Turkey can also be thawed in the microwave. Cook immediately after defrosting and do not refreeze thawed turkey until it is cooked. It is not necessary to rinse the thawed turkey with water prior to cooking. Although washing the turkey can remove surface bacteria, the recommended roasting temperature easily destroys any bacteria present on th...|$|E

We describe the digestion and dissociation of prostate tissue into single-cell suspensions containing both prostatic epithelial and stromal cells, {{the isolation of}} epithelial cells from the parental population via fluorescence activated cell sorting, and the plating conditions and medium for prostate organoid culture. We also describe the serial passaging and freezing of cultures, which can resume growth after thawing. The dissection and dissociation of prostate tissue and the preparation of cells for plating takes 8 - 9 hours. Organoids that can be quantified and analyzed are obtained after 7 - 10 days. Our culture system supports the growth and serial passaging of both normal and transformed organoids, and should be useful for studies of normal prostate as well as prostate cancer. ### Introduction Three-dimensional “organoid” culture techniques {{have been used for}} culture of stem/progenitor cells from tissues including the small intestine, stomach, liver and pancreas (1 - 4). We have developed a novel method for the culture of prostate epithelial organoids that display tissue architecture resembling that of the normal prostate (5). Our culture system supports the growth and serial passaging of prostate luminal cells, which have historically been difficult to grow, and differs from previous “prostasphere” conditions, which favor the growth of prostate basal cells and fail to display a response to androgen deprivation (6). In particular, our organoid culture conditions allow for the growth of prostate organoids from single luminal stem/progenitor cells, as well as mouse tumor organoids, and thus should be widely applicable for studies of prostate biology. Notably, our culture methods are distinct from recently published conditions for prostate organoid culture using defined media conditions (7, 8). In the following protocol, we describe the digestion and dissociation of prostate tissue into single-cell suspensions containing both prostatic epithelial and stromal cells, the isolation of epithelial cells from the parental population via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using antibodies against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM, also CD 326) and epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin, also CD 324), and the plating conditions and medium for prostate organoid culture using supplemented hepatocyte medium with 5 % Matrigel. We also describe the serial passaging and freezing of cultures, which can resume growth after thawing. ### Materials 1. 1 Prostate dissection and collagenase digestion 1. 1 or 2 male C 57 BL/ 6 mice (or mice of interest) - PBS (for dissection) - 10 x collagenase/hyaluronidase solution (STEMCELL Technologies # 07912) - Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F- 12 (DMEM/F- 12, Gibco # 10565) supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) 1. 2 Enzymatic dissociation to single cell suspension 1. 0. 25 % Trypsin/EDTA (STEMCELL Technologies # 07901) - Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution Modified (HBSS, STEMCELL Technologies # 37150), supplemented with 2 % FBS - Dispase 5 mg/mL (STEMCELL Technologies # 07913) - DNaseI 1 mg/mL (STEMCELL Technologies # 07900) - Trypan blue solution 0. 4 % (Gibco # 15250 - 061) - HBSS + 2 % FBS + 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 (STEMCELL Technologies # 07171) (Critical: We recommend purchasing ROCK inhibitor from STEMCELL Technologies for consistent results.) 1. 3. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) preparation 1. Anti-mouse EpCAM APC antibody (BioLegend 118214) - Anti-mouse E-Cadherin PerCP-Efluor 710 antibody (eBiosciences 46 - 3249 - 82) - 0. 5 mg/mL DAPI - HBSS + 2 % FBS + 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 1. 4. Medium preparation and cell plating 1. 96 -well low-attachment plate (Corning # 3474) - 24 -well flat bottom plate (BD # 353047) (for embedding culture) - Hepatocyte medium (Corning # 355056) (Tip: This reagent has regularly been on back order. Check in advance for availability.) - 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF; comes with Corning # 3555056) - Heat-inactivated, charcoal stripped FBS (Gibco # 12676) (Critical: Charcoal-stripped FBS must be heat-inactivated prior to use by heating in 55 °C water bath for 60 min. Heat-inactivated charcoal-stripped FBS can be aliquoted and stored at - 20 °C.) - 100 x Glutamax (Gibco # 35050) - Thawed matrigel (Corning # 354234) (Critical: After removal of Matrigel from storage at - 20 °C, it must remain on ice at all times until use to prevent polymerization. We recommend placing Matrigel on ice in a 4 °C refrigerator overnight to thaw and keeping it on ice until it is added to media. Unused Matrigel can be refrozen, but avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.) - 5 mM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 - 10 - 5 M dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in ethanol (Sigma #A- 8380) - 100 x antibiotic-antimycotic (Caution: We recommend culturing without antibiotics, but antibiotics can be added during the initial culture period or if there is concern for contamination from other sources.) 1. 5. Passaging and freezing organoids 1. Cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) - 0. 25 % Trypsin/EDTA - HBSS + 2 % FBS - Prepared organoid media (see 2. 4) - Heat-inactivated, charcoal stripped FBS - Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma #D 2650) ### Equipment 1. CO 2 euthanasia chamber - Dissecting microscope - Micro-dissecting instruments - Water baths set at 37 °C and 55 °C - Sterile petri dishes - Eppendorf tubes (1. 5 mL) - Incubator, humidified at 37 °C, with 5 % CO 2 - Laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet - Centrifuges (for Eppendorf and Falcon tubes) - Falcon tubes (15 and 50 mL) - Orbital shaker - Cell strainer 40 uM (Corning # 352340) - Hemocytometer - BD FACSAria cell sorter (or similar) ### Procedure Critical: The volumes detailed below are for dissociation of an intact prostate from an 8 - 12 week wild type mouse. For larger prostate samples such as those from aggressive tumor models, all reagents should be increased proportionally from the volumes suggested below. For example, if a prostate tumor is approximately twice the size of a wild type prostate, 2 x the volume of suggested reagents should be used. 2. 1. Prostate dissection and collagenase digestion 1. In tissue culture hood, combine 200 µL 10 x collagenase/hyaluronidase mixture with 1. 8 mL DMEM/F 12 + 5 % FBS. Place in 37 °C water bath <b>until</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> - Resect mouse prostates and transfer to sterile petri dish containing cold PBS for dissection 6. Using a dissecting microscope, fine forceps, and sharp scissors, remove residual fat from prostate tissue. - Fill 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tube with 1 mL of diluted pre-warmed collagenase/hyaluronidase solution and transfer prostate tissue into the tube. - Using small, sharp sterile scissors, macerate the prostate tissue by rapidly opening and closing the scissors inside the tube to cut the tissue into small pieces. Fill the tube with an additional 400 - 500 µL dilute collagenase/hyaluronidase solution until almost full. - Incubate in 37 °C incubator for 3 hours. (Tip: The Eppendorf tube may be placed on its side in a sterile petri dish to maximize the surface area of prostate tissue exposed to collagenase/hyaluronidase solution. Periodic shaking of the tube to redistribute prostate tissue is helpful.) 2. 2. Enzymatic dissociation to single cell suspension 1. Centrifuge digested tissue at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Resuspend pellet in 1. 5 mL cold 0. 25 % trypsin-EDTA and transfer to 50 mL conical tube. Incubate in 4 °C refrigerator for 1 hour. (Caution: To minimize cell death, keep trypsin ≤ 4 °C prior to and during use. Trypsin can be gently thawed overnight with Matrigel and kept on ice. An orbital shaker can be used during the trypsinization step for optimal digestion.) - During trypsinization, place 900 µL dispase in 37 °C water bath at least 10 minutes prior to use. Immediately before use, add 100 µL DNaseI to dispase solution. - After trypsinization is complete (1 hour), add cold HBSS + 2 % FBS (equal to 2 x volume of trypsin) to quench reaction. Centrifuge at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Add 1 mL of pre-warmed dispase/DNaseI solution. Pipette the sample vigorously for 1 - 2 minutes using P 1000 pipette until solution is homogenously translucent with no visible tissue fragments. (Do not allow digestion to continue for more than 2 minutes.) (Critical: To maximize cell dissociation, this pipetting step should be done continuously.) - Add cold HBSS + 2 % FBS (equal to 5 x volume of dispase) to quench reaction. - Filter cell suspension through a 40 µm cell strainer into a new 50 mL conical tube. - Centrifuge filtered suspension at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Resuspend pellet in 1 mL HBSS + 2 % FBS and transfer to 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tube. - Count viable cells using a hemacytometer and trypan blue. - Centrifuge and resuspend cells in HBSS + 2 % FBS at 100 µL/ 1 × 10 e 6 cells. (If fewer than 1 × 10 e 6 cells are obtained, resuspend in 100 µL) 2. 3. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) *Keep cell suspension and reagents on ice until sorting is finished. 1. Divide cell suspension into four 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tubes as follows - a. Tube 1 (unstained control) : 100 µL (1 × 10 e 6 cells) - b. Tube 2 (PerCP control) : 100 µL (1 × 10 e 6 cells) - c. Tube 3 (APC control) : 100 µL (1 × 10 e 6 cells) - d. Tube 4 (sample for collection) : remaining sample (up to 1 mL) - Add FACS antibodies as follows: - a. Tube 1 : no antibody - b. Tube 2 : 1 µL (1 : 100) anti-mouse E-cadherin PerCP-Efluor 710 antibody - c. Tube 3 : 1 µL (1 : 100) anti-mouse APC-EpCAM antibody - d. Tube 4 : both antibodies at 1 : 100 dilution (1 µL antibody per 100 µL cell suspension). - (Critical: If fewer than 4 × 10 e 6 cells are obtained after enzymatic dissociation, use 10 µL of cell suspension for control tubes 1 - 3 and dilute with 90 µL HBSS + 2 % FBS for a total of 100 µL. Use the same antibody concentrations. Resuspend tubes 1 - 3 in 50 µL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS instead of 500 µL in step 6 of cell sorting and use 1 µL of dilute DAPI instead of 10 µL.) - Cover with foil and incubate on ice for 25 minutes. - Spin tubes at 350 rcf at 4 °C for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Add 500 µL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS to all tubes. Spin at 350 rcf at 4 °C for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Resuspend all tubes in 500 µL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS + 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632. - Prepare a 1 : 100 dilution of 0. 5 mg/mL DAPI by adding 5 µL DAPI to 495 µL HBSS + 2 % FBS. Add 10 µL of dilute DAPI to each tube. - Transfer each suspension into a labeled round-bottom clear rubber-top plastic test tube for loading into sorter. - Prior to sorting, prepare multiple 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tubes pre-filled with 500 µL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS + 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 for collecting cells. - Perform sorting via sterile FACS facility (tubes 1 - 3 will be used to set appropriate gates; tube 4 will be used to collect cells for plating). Collecting cells at 60, 000 cells per tube will facilitate easier plating. Keep collected cells on ice until ready to plate. 2. 4. Medium preparation and cell plating 1. Prepare desired amount of culture medium by combining the following components to the indicated final concentrations (a-d can be combined and stored as a 50 mL aliquot at 4 °C for up to 4 weeks; e-h should be added on the day of use based on the amount of media needed) : - a. Hepatocyte medium (47 mL per 50 mL media) - b. 10 ng/mL EGF (100 µL of 5 µg/mL stock per 50 mL media) - c. 5 % heat-inactivated, charcoal-stripped FBS (2. 5 mL per 50 mL media) - d. 1 x Glutamax (500 µL per 50 mL media) - e. 5 % Matrigel (50 µL per 1 mL media) - f. 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 (2 µL of 5 mM stock per 1 mL media) - g. 100 nM DHT (10 µL of 10 e- 5 M stock per 1 mL media) - h. 1 x antibiotic-antimycotic (10 µL per 1 mL media; optional) - Keep prepared culture media at room temperature until use (rapid warming in 37 °C water bath may cause Matrigel to solidify at top of tube). - Centrifuge sorted cells at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and resuspend in prepared media at 5, 000 cells per 100 µL media. (If cells were collected at 60, 000 cells per Eppendorf tube, resuspend in 1. 2 mL media. If there is concern for cell death, count viable cells prior to centrifuging and resuspend accordingly.) - Add resuspended cells to 96 -well low attachment plate at 100 µL per well for a final plating density of 5, 000 cells per well. - Change media every 4 days by adding 100 µL fresh media to each well on days 4 and 8 after plating. On day 12, when wells are full (300 µL), transfer each well to a 1. 5 ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 250 rcf for 5 minutes. Remove 200 µL of supernatant and add 100 µL fresh media (total volume will be 200 µL). Transfer onto a new 96 -well plate using P 1000 pipet tip (smaller tips may damage organoids). Alternate every 4 days between either adding 100 µL media or spinning down to remove 200 µL and add 100 µL until ready for passage. (Multiple wells can be pooled prior to centrifuging and redistributed evenly if there are many wells.) 2. 5. Cell plating using embedding conditions 1. Medium preparation is the same as in 2. 4. 1 except that component e is not added. Media can be pre-warmed in a 37 °C water bath. This pre-warmed media will be used to cover the solidified Matrigel ring in 2. 5. 7. - Prepare cold media as in 2. 4. 1 except that component e is not added and f is at a final concentration of 25 µM (5 µL of 5 mM stock per 1 mL media). Keep this media on ice and it will be used to resuspend cells. - Pellet cells as in 2. 4. 3 and resuspend in prepared cold media at 5, 000 cells per 40 µL media. (If cells were collected at 60, 000 cells per Eppendorf tube, resuspend in 480 µL media.) (Tip: For the embedding condition, the number of cells plated can be much lower.) - Mix the 40 µL media containing cells thoroughly with 60 µl Matrigel (If 60, 000 cells are resuspended in 480 µL media, mix with 720 µL Matrigel). Avoid bubbles. This step should be done on ice to prevent Matrigel solidification. - Plate the 100 µL media Matrigel mixture around the ring of a well in a 24 -well plate. - Incubate the 24 -well plate in 37 °C incubator for 30 minutes to allow the Matrigel ring to solidify. - Add 400 µL pre-warmed media as prepared in 2. 5. 1 to each well. (Critical: Make sure that the media is warm enough prior to addition to the well to avoid dissolving the Matrigel ring.) - Change media every 4 days by aspirating the media off the Matrigel ring and adding fresh media. (Tip: Aspiration should be performed {{from the middle of the}} well to avoid disturbing the Matrigel ring.) 2. 6. Passaging and freezing organoids 1. When organoids are large (usually 3 - 5 weeks after plating), prepare organoids for passage by transferring into 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tubes and spinning at 250 rcf for 5 minutes. (Multiple wells can be pooled.) Discard supernatant. - Wash cells in cold PBS and spin again at 250 rcf for 5 minutes. (Critical: Without this PBS washing step, the trypsin reaction will not be optimal due to residual FBS in the medium, resulting in incomplete dissociation into single cells.) - Add 1 mL warm 0. 25 % trypsin/EDTA and incubate in a 37 °C water bath for 5 minutes. (Tip: In the context of very large organoids or organoids that are difficult to dissociate, step 3 can be replaced by incubation in cold 0. 25 % trypsin/EDTA at 4 °C for 30 minutes.) - Pipette up and down with P 200 pipet tip for 30 seconds to dissociate cells. - Transfer suspension into a 15 mL conical tube prefilled with 2 mL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS. - Centrifuge at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Resuspend cell pellet in fresh media and plate into a new low-attachment 96 -well plate. Cells can be plated by either replating 4 x the number of wells passaged in 100 µL per well or by counting viable cells and replating at 5, 000 cells/ 100 µL media per well. - Organoids can be frozen at any point during a passage cycle by centrifuging at 250 rcf for 5 minutes and resuspending in 1 mL freezing media in 1. 8 mL cryo tubes (50 % FBS, 40 % hepatocyte media, 10 % DMSO). Gradual freezing to ≤ - 80 ° using an insulated cryofreezing container is recommended. Organoids should be thawed rapidly in a 37 °C water bath and immediately diluted in 10 mL HBSS + 2 % FBS per 1 mL freezing media. Centrifuge thawed organoids at 250 rcf for 5 minutes and resuspend in organoid culture media for plating. 2. 7. Passaging and freezing of embedded organoids 1. Dissolve the Matrigel ring by adding about 125 µL dispase at 5 mg/mL to each well of the 24 -well plate to make the final concentration of dispase 1 mg/ml. - Incubate in 37 °C incubator for 10 minutes. - If the Matrigel ring dissolves, proceed as in 2. 6. 1. If not, incubate at 37 °C for another 5 minutes. ### Timing It should take approximately 8 - 9 hours (depending on experience) from dissection of mouse tissue to plating of sorted epithelial cells. ### Troubleshooting 3. 1. Incomplete cell dissociation after dispase step 1. Check that all reagents are within the use by date - Make sure to thoroughly mince tissues prior to collagenase/hyaluronidase digestion. - During the dispase step, make sure the solution is pre-warmed at 37 °C for at least 10 minutes and perform vigorous pipetting of sample for up to 2 minutes. 3. 2. Organoids fail to form from plated cells 1. Ensure the DAPI aliquot being used results in optimal exclusion of dead cells during sorting. Replace if necessary. - Decrease the speed and pressure used during sorting. 3. 3. Plated cells form adherent cultures instead of organoids 1. Ensure you are using a low-attachment surface plate. - Some low-attachment brands will still result in adherent cultures. We have found that the Costar plates from Corning are optimal for minimizing cell adherence. ### Anticipated Results Organoid formation from plated cells is a rapid process, and small organoids should be identifiable after about 3 days for organoids from wild-type mice, or within 24 hours for organoids derived from mouse models of prostate cancer. Organoid forming efficiency should be quantitated approximately 7 - 10 days after plating of sorted cells. Wild-type cells should generate large cystic structures, while tumor cells will form more solid organoids. If the EpCAM E-Cadherin sorting strategy is utilized, there should not be any evidence of fibroblast cells in organoid cultures. ### References 1. Sato, T. et al.

Belmont This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “Development of Mammalian Cell Lines with lac Operator-Tagged Chromosomes,” Chapter 25, in[*Live Cell Imaging*]([URL] Goldman and Spector). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2005. ### INTRODUCTION The discovery and use of fluorescent proteins to label chromosomal proteins has yielded basic structural information as well as insights into dynamics that were previously inaccessible. This protocol describes a method for tagging specific chromosome sites using the *lac* operator/repressor system, wherein direct repeats of bacterial operator sequences are coupled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged proteins that recognize these sequences. Direct *lac* operator repeats are generated by directional cloning. Although the use of direct repeats, as opposed to inverted repeats, reduces recombination within the bacterial host at high copy number, even the direct repeats are unstable, requiring the use of special bacterial hosts and low-copy-number plasmids for cloning. The introduction of the *lac* operator repeats into eukaryotic cells uses traditional transformation methods. Techniques for the isolation of stable cell clones with varying transgene copy numbers are described in the protocol, as are several methods for visual screening {{of large numbers of}} stable cell clones to isolate rare clones containing labeled chromosomal regions with desired features. ### RELATED INFORMATION In principle, chromosome tagging can be accomplished through the use of any repetitive sequence to which a specific protein binds. The first application of this approach used the bacterial lac operator and Lac repressor combination. The lac operator/Lac repressor-labeling system has been successfully adapted for tagging chromatin in live bacteria, yeast, and mammalian tissue culture cells (Fig. 1), as well as in multicellular organisms including *Caenorhabditis elegans*, *Drosophila*, and *Arabidopsis*. Subsequent approaches have used tet operator or glucocorticoid receptor element repeats. Recently, the lac operator system has been used in combination with the bacteriophage viral replicase translational operator and several color variants of GFP to label DNA, RNA, and protein in living cells. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1. ** Examples of different stable cell lines with lac operator-tagged chromosome regions visualized by GFP-Lac repressor in vivo expression.

Clone the lac operator repeat into a vector. - *This protocol is based on preparations from our laboratory using the pSV 2 -DHFR- 8. 32 plasmid containing a 256 -copy lac operator repeat*. - i. Use Stbl 2 competent cells grown at 30 °C to help maintain full-length lac operator repeats. - ii. Clone the lac operator repeats into low-copy-number vectors (e. g., psv 2 -DHFR- 8. 32). - *Having too many copies in a cell increases the possibility of recombination*. - Purify vector DNA as follows: - The purification of vector DNA should take no more than 3 d to complete (4 d if the optional second minipreps are performed in Step 2. viii). Recombination may occur if plates or cultures from Step 1 are allowed to stand at 4 °C; thus it is important to complete this procedure without delay. However, the plasmid DNA, once prepared from the cells, is stable. Because low-copy-number plasmids are used, expect low yields at every purification step. - i. Streak bacteria from a stab culture onto an LB plate containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL). Store the stab culture in the dark at room temperature. - ii. Incubate the inoculated LB plate for 24 h at 30 °C. - *Even after this length of time, the colonies will be small*. - iii. Inoculate at least 10 3 -mL cultures of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) with well-isolated colonies. Incubate the cultures on a shaker overnight at 30 °C. - iv. Prepare DNA using a miniprep procedure (e. g., QIAGEN) from 1. 5 mL of each culture. Store the remainder of each culture at 4 °C. - v. Digest aliquots of the DNA with SalI and XhoI. Separate the DNA fragments on an agarose gel (0. 7 %). - *At this step, it is critical to be very discerning. Any bands present other than those expected could indicate recombination of the plasmid (in the case of the pSV 2 -DHFR- 8. 32 plasmid containing a 256 -copy lac operator repeat, expect 10 -kb and 5 -kb fragments) *. - vi. Prepare and freeze a glycerol stock, or prepare a stab culture of each positive clone (from the stored cultures in Step 2. iv). - vii. Inoculate 500 mL of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) with the remaining culture from one of the positive clones. Incubate the culture overnight at 30 °C with shaking. - *It may be preferable to prepare two 500 -mL cultures, each from a different positive clone, in the event that one clone is lost during large-scale growth*. - viii. (Optional) Before proceeding with the maxiprep DNA isolation, isolate DNA from an aliquot of the 500 -mL culture by repeating Steps 2. iv- 2. v. While preparing the miniprep DNA, centrifuge the 500 -mL culture. Discard the supernatant, and freeze the bacterial pellet <b>until</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> Use positive cultures for the following step: - ix. Isolate DNA from the 500 -mL culture using a maxiprep procedure. If using QIAGEN maxipreps with Qiafilters, double the volume of P 1, P 2, and P 3 added to each pellet, and then split the prep into two Qiafilters. This prevents the Qiafilter from clogging. - *The yield of DNA will be low. A good yield is ~ 125 μg of DNA per 500 -mL culture*. - x. Digest aliquots of the DNA with SalI and XhoI to confirm that only DNA fragments of the expected size are present. **Making Stable Cell Lines Containing lac Operator Repeats** 3. Grow cells for transfection for ~ 1 wk. - *CHO DG 44 cells are derivatives of CHO K 1 cells and are doubly deleted for the DHFR locus. The product of the DHFR gene is necessary for intermediary metabolism of thymidylates and purines. An imbalance of nucleotides in cells may be the cause of both insert instability due to gene amplification and an abnormal cell cycle due to interference with replication timing*. 4. Purify plasmid DNA for transfection as follows: - i. Transfer 300 μL of vector DNA solution (~ 100 μg/mL) into a 1. 5 -mL microcentrifuge tube. - ii. Add 33 μL of sodium acetate (3 M, pH 5. 5) to the DNA, and thoroughly mix the solution with a pipette. - iii. Add 660 μL of ice-cold 100 % ethanol to the tube, and mix the contents by inverting the tube several times. Let the tube stand on dry ice for 5 min. - *At this step, white fibers of DNA precipitate should be visible*. - iv. Centrifuge the reaction in a microcentrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. For convenience, label the location of the pellet inside the tube with a permanent marker. - v. Remove the supernatant, and wash the pellet with 1 mL of 70 % ethanol at 4 °C by inverting the tube several times. Centrifuge the tube in a microcentrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. - *Carry out all subsequent steps in a sterile environment*. - vi. Remove the supernatant, and immerse the entire open tube in 70 % ethanol for 10 sec. Remove the supernatant. Air-dry the DNA pellet for 10 - 15 min. - vii. Dissolve the dried DNA in 200 μL of sterile H 2 O or TE buffer. - viii. Aliquot DNA dissolved in H 2 O and freeze at - 20 °C for short-term storage. DNA dissolved in TE buffer is stable for at least several weeks at 4 °C. - ix. Remove an aliquot of the DNA, and estimate the concentration and purity of the DNA. 5. Transform cells using calcium-phosphate-precipitated DNA. *Use only chemical transformation with competent cells, not electroporation, because increased recombination following electroporation has been observed. The efficiency of transfection using calcium-phosphate-precipitated DNA strongly depends on the growth state of recipient cells, concentration of calcium and phosphates, concentration of DNA, pH, temperature, and duration of the precipitation reaction. It is advisable to prepare several buffers with slightly different pH values (see Step 5. iii below) *. - i. Plate CHO DG 44 cells in three 75 -cm 2 flasks the day before transfection. - ii. Replace the medium in the flasks with fresh medium 4 h before transfection. Cells should be 50 %- 80 % confluent and be in the log phase of growth for efficient transfection. - iii. Prepare three reaction tubes. In each one, dilute 7 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA (from Step 4. vii) in 0. 5 mL of CaCl 2 (250 mM), mixed with 0. 5 mL of TR buffer, varying only in its pH value (6. 95, 7. 05, or 7. 10). Incubate the reactions for 30 min at room temperature. - iv. Add each DNA mixture dropwise to a flask of cells (from Step 5. ii). Incubate the flasks for 24 h. - v. Replace the transfection medium with F- 12 (HAM) medium supplemented with 10 % defined FBS, and incubate the cells for an additional 24 h. - vi. Replace the medium with selective medium (F- 12 medium lacking thymidine and hypoxanthine, but containing 10 % dialyzed FBS). Stable transformants are obtained after 2 wk of selection. **Enrichment of Stable Cells with Large-Copy-Number Inserts Using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting** *This procedure describes the selection of CHO cells expressing high amounts of exogenous DHFR from a pool of stably transformed cells using cell sorting, a strategy to enrich for cells harboring large chromosome insertions of the DHFR-containing transgene. Selection is based on binding a fluorescent cell-permeable DHFR inhibitor to the pool of cellular DHFR. Cells with high fluorescence show a high total expression of DHFR, which correlates roughly with copy number (as well as chromosome position effects) *. 6. Select and sort the cells as follows: - i. Grow cells in 25 -cm 2 tissue culture flasks until they are in log phase. - ii. Replace the growth medium with fresh F- 12 (HAM) medium supplemented with FBS (10 %) and FMTX (20 μM). Add glycine (100 μM), hypoxanthine (30 μM), and thymine (30 μM) to the medium to relieve the toxic effects of FMTX. Incubate the cells for 8 h. - iii. Harvest cells by trypsinization, and keep them in sterile PBS on ice. - *Because FMTX is retained in cells at concentrations high enough to cause damage, cells are viable in PBS on ice only for several hours*. - iv. Sort the cells into flasks or 96 -well plates. - v. Grow enough cells for freezing, and freeze them after screening. 7. Prepare a large number of clones for screening or subcloning as follows: - i. Plate cells produced in Step 6 onto a Petri dish at a low density, ideally, 20 - 100 cells per 150 -mm dish. To minimize cross-contamination among neighboring colonies, make sure that the density of plating is low enough and that the colonies are spread out. Use several Petri dishes, titrating the cell concentration by factors of 2 - 3 between dishes, to ensure optimal cell density. - *The action of the trypsin (Step 6. iii) must have progressed enough to ensure the absence of cell clumping and the predominance of single cells in suspension. This is aided by mechanical agitation or by vigorous pipetting of the culture*. - ii. Return the cells to the incubator, and if possible, avoid moving the dishes (particularly after the first few days) for ~ 10 d to allow good-size colonies to form. - *Movement of the dishes will cause cells to dislodge and form satellite colonies and/or a lawn of dispersed cells, increasing cross-contamination*. - iii. Allow the cells to grow until the colonies are well-defined and visible by eye while avoiding overgrowth to minimize colony cross-contamination. Mark individual isolated colonies {{on the bottom of the}} plate with a permanent marker. View the colonies under low magnification to check for the presence of undesirable smaller colonies growing in the vicinity of any colony of interest. 8. If visual screening of the clones is unnecessary, then pick and harvest a large number of colonies from the 150 -mm-diameter Petri dish (from Step 7), using one of the subcloning methods described below. If live visual screening is desired, refer to the Discussion regarding subcloning stable transformants. **Trypsin Method for Picking Colonies** - i. Cut filter paper into small squares, each with an area of ~ 4 mm 2. Use sharp-tipped forceps to place the squares together in a glass Petri dish. Cover them and sterilize by autoclaving. - ii. Aspirate the medium from the Petri dish containing the marked colonies (from Step 7. iii above). - iii. Wash the cells with sterile calcium- and magnesium-free PBS (CMF-PBS), and remove excess liquid. - iv. Dispense trypsin solution into a small sterile Petri dish. Using the sterile forceps, dip a sterile filter paper (from Step 8. i) in trypsin, blot it to remove excess trypsin, and place it over a colony. - v. Repeat Step 8. iv for each of the colonies. Return the Petri dish containing the cells to the incubator for ~ 5 min. - vi. Transfer each filter paper into a separate well of a 96 -well microtiter plate containing 0. 1 mL of tissue culture medium per well. If visual screening will be performed, use a glass-bottom 96 -well plate. Duplicate plating can be accomplished by dipping the filter paper into one well to dislodge some cells, and then dropping the filter paper into a well of a second 96 -well plate. - *The efficiency of colony duplication by this method is close to 100 %. Do not leave the cells without buffer for more than 15 - 20 min or they will dry out. Also, CMF-PBS may induce rounding of cells and/or detachment after prolonged treatment (see Steps 8. x and 8. xi) *. - vii. Grow the collected cells in the 96 -well plates for 1 - 2 d. - viii. Remove the filter paper pieces from the wells, taking care to avoid cross-contamination. One method for doing this is to attach a plastic hose to a vacuum system with an in-line trap. Insert the larger end of a 1 -mL micropipette tip into the hose. Cut the other end of the tip to accommodate a sterile 200 -μL micropipette tip. Next, insert the 200 -μL tip into the bottom of a well. The vacuum will cause the filter paper to adhere to the tip. Withdraw the tip, and discard both the filter paper and the 200 -μL pipette tip. Finally, repeat with the remaining wells, using a fresh sterile 200 -μL tip each time. - ix. Continue to grow the cells until their numbers are sufficient for screening. Screen the cells from each well, and freeze the positive clones. Examine the positive clones by microscopy for the biological activity of interest. **Micropipette Tip Method for Picking Colonies** *This method works well with more densely packed colonies, and it is faster than the trypsin method (Steps 8. i- 8. ix). A few hundred colonies can be easily transferred within a couple of hours. Once this method is optimized, efficiency is near 100 %, although the number of cells transferred per colony into the well may be somewhat lower*. - x. Mark the colonies that are less likely to be cross-contaminated with cells from other colonies. Rinse the cells twice with CMF-PBS (10 mL per 150 -mm dish). Add a small amount of CMF-PBS (~ 4 - 6 mL), just sufficient to cover the surface of the dish, and return the dish to the incubator. - xi. After ~ 5 min, look at the cells under a microscope to see if cells in colonies have rounded. If not, incubate further. Once the cells in the colony have rounded, but are still attached, they can be picked. - xii. Use a permanent marker to circle small groups of colonies on the bottom of the dish. This helps to keep track of which colonies have already been harvested. - xiii. Using a fresh 200 -μL pipette tip per colony, scrape two to three times over the colony while aspirating 10 μL into the pipette tip. Insert the pipette tip into the well of a 96 -well plate, pipetting medium from the well several times into the tip to wash the cells off into the well. - xiv. Grow cells until their numbers are sufficient for screening. Screen the cells from each well, and freeze the positive clones. Examine the positive clones by microscopy for the biological activity of interest. ### DISCUSSION In general, screening of clones uses either a visual, microscope-based screen (if possible) or a molecular or biochemical screen. In some cases, both might be combined, either as two sequential screens or one parallel screen. An example from our work is a screen of a set of 96 subclones transfected with a nonfluorescent VP 16 transcriptional activator fusion protein. A visual immunofluorescence assay was used to test directly for expression of the activator, and a transient transfection expression assay was run to test the capability of each clone to activate a luciferase reporter gene. The intersection of these two screens yielded a clone that induced chromosome repositioning after induction of VP 16 targeting. A starting point for subcloning is to determine roughly what fraction of stable transformants show the desired properties. If this fraction is large, then we typically carry out the initial transformation in a single flask, followed by subsequent subcloning of the mixed stable transformant pool by serial dilution cloning into 96 -well plates. A range of dilutions should be used to ensure success. The advantage of serial dilution is that the investigator can more easily verify whether the cells in a given well actually arise from a single clone. If the fraction of desired cells is small (a few percent or less), and if a visual screen is possible, we prepare a single coverslip from the mixed pool of stable transformants and obtain an initial estimate of exactly how many clones need to be screened. One approach is to initially subclone in pools of clones (e. g., five to 10 per well). In theory, this should allow cloning of even rare transformants through several stages of subcloning. Often, however, the desired subclones are rare because of a selective bias against growth of these clones. In this case, if the pool size is too great, the percentage of desired cells can drop in the culture prior to the next stage of subcloning, producing diminishing returns. A better approach, where possible, is cell sorting with flow cytometry to enrich the cell population with cells containing the desired expression levels (see Step 6 above). When large numbers of clones are required, and if visual screening is unnecessary, we simply pick large numbers of colonies from a 150 -mm-diameter Petri dish, using either small, trypsin-soaked pieces of filter paper (Steps 8. i- 8. ix above) or micropipette tips (Steps 8. x- 8. xiv above). These are used to deposit clonal cells into 96 -well plates. Both methods are very rapid but have a high risk of clone contamination, due to the use of a single Petri dish. Any clones selected, based on a secondary screen, must go through an additiona...|$|E
