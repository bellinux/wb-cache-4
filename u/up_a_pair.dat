The money was allocated to a costly surgery {{to be performed}} in New York, which doctors in Canada were unable to perform. Brulé received further media attention a year later for picking <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of hitchhikers {{who turned out to}} be Irish rock band U2 frontman Bono and his assistant in a West Vancouver neighbourhood on May31,2011. In return, Brulé was given backstage passes for him and his mother, for U2's concert in Edmonton on the next day. During the show, Bono thanked Brulé for the ride.|$|E

25|$|Game5 was a pitcher's duel for {{the first}} five innings, with Boston's Cy Young and Pittsburg's Brickyard Kennedy giving up no runs. That changed {{in the top of the}} sixth, however, when the Americans scored a then-record six runs before being retired. Young, on the other hand, managed to keep his shutout intact before finally giving <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of runs in the bottom of the eighth. He went the {{distance}} and struck out four for his first World Series win.|$|E
25|$|In the Winter {{months that}} followed, England toured Pakistan {{following}} their Ashes success looking {{to extend their}} unbeaten streak of six Test series (with only two lost Tests) since 2004. Strauss started the tour unnervingly, with warm up scores of two fives and a six, mustering 56 in the final warm up innings. Despite acknowledging his batting problems, Strauss' performance never recovered as he scored only 44 runs {{in the first two}} Test matches, losing the first and drawing the second, at an average of 11 before he departed Pakistan to attend the birth of his first child, missing England's final loss. Strauss returned for the One Day series but showed little improvement with only five runs in the tour match, but found more success shuffled down to third man, top scoring 94 to help England win the first match. He also scored 26 runs in the low scoring, final match which England also won but in between picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of ducks.|$|E
25|$|With a 25-run lead, England {{knew they}} would need to open up a decent margin over New Zealand in their second innings to take the match away from the tourists. Despite the loss of both captain Alastair Cook and Nick Compton in the first 10 overs, England started well, as Jonathan Trott and Joe Root built a third-wicket {{partnership}} of 123, the only century partnership in the match. However, the loss of Root for 71 with the last ball of the 50th over {{was the beginning of the}} end. Trott achieved his half-century in the following over, but Bairstow's wicket fell soon after, followed by Matt Prior, who picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> off Tim Southee. Trott was out himself two overs before the close of play, and England finished on 180/6. On the fourth morning, Southee went on to tear through the English lower order, which included an out-of-sorts Ian Bell, who had spent most of the previous day recovering from flu-like symptoms. England were eventually all out for 213 in just 68.3 overs, despite having been 159/2 in the 50th. Only Stuart Broad showed any resistance, scoring an unbeaten 26, and it was a sign of things to come.|$|E

25|$|With intent only to {{slow down}} the {{progress}} of the Union vessels and not to make a determined stand, the Confederates had set <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of batteries on the bluffs near St. Charles, Arkansas, some 80 miles (130km) above the river mouth. The guns were taken from a gunboat which they had then scuttled {{in the middle of the}} stream as a further impediment. On 17 June, the Federal flotilla arrived at that point; the soldiers went ashore to attack the batteries from the land side, while the two armored gunboats came up the river, Mound City leading. Shots were exchanged between the gunboats and the shore batteries, with nothing exceptional until a chance shot from the upper battery happened to penetrate the casemate of the lead gunboat. The shot killed some men in its passage, but most of the damage it caused occurred when it hit the vessel's steam drum. Hot steam immediately filled the entire boat, killing and scalding most of the crew. Those who could do so jumped overboard into the river, where Rebel sharpshooters shot them as they tried to swim to safety. By the time the carnage was over, 105 men were dead by the first shot, scalding, drowning, or being shot in the water. An additional 25 were injured by the steam. Among the wounded was Commander Kilty, who survived and later returned to service in the Navy, although he lost his left arm. Only 25 men of the entire crew escaped without major injury. Meanwhile, the soldiers had moved into position to assault the batteries, so the Confederates fled, leaving their wounded and their guns behind.|$|E

The class was given a displacement of [...] as a limit on size; all of the officers opted to design either fast or slow battleships, {{with the exception of}} Lieutenant Durand-Viel, who chose instead to create a design for a battlecruiser. Durand-Viel drew <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of designs, which were evaluated by the General Staff in June 1914. He saw his ships forming a fast division of the battle fleet capable of encircling an enemy squadron; as with Gille's design, this required heavy armament and armor to permit the ships to engage battleships.|$|E

During its course Morrison worked on leftover material from his previous two albums (Astral Weeks and Moondance), recorded songs that he had not performed in the studio before ("Crazy Face" [...] and [...] "Give Me a Kiss"), as well as two instrumentals. Limited recording equipment was used, operated by drummer Dahaud Shaar, who was intending to open a recording studio in Woodstock at the time. Shaar remembered: [...] "I found an old church and we would just load in. I'd set <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of mikes and we would just run down some tracks with the tapes running.

500|$|His restive nature, however, did not diminish. As a young man, Saint-Just was [...] "wild, handsome, [...] transgressive". Well-connected and popular, {{he showed}} a special affection toward {{a young woman}} of Blérancourt, Thérèse Gellé. She was the {{daughter}} of another wealthy notary, a powerful and autocratic figure in the town; he was still an undistinguished adolescent. He is said to have proposed marriage to her; she is said to have desired it. Though no hard evidence exists regarding their relationship, official records show that on 25 July 1786, Thérèse was married to Emmanuel Thorin, the scion of a prominent local family. Saint-Just was out of town and unaware of the event, and tradition portrays him as brokenhearted. Whatever his true state, it is known that {{a few weeks after the}} marriage he abruptly left home for Paris – without an announcement, but not without gathering <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of pistols and a good quantity of his mother's silver. His venture turned short when his mother had him seized by police and sent to a reformatory (maison de correction) where he stayed from September 1786 to March 1787. Chastened, Saint-Just attempted to begin anew: he enrolled as a student at the School of Law, Reims University. After a year, however, he drifted away from law school and returned to his mother's home in Blérancourt penniless, without any occupational prospects.|$|E
500|$|After one-hitting Boston on May 2, 1904, Philadelphia Athletics pitcher Rube Waddell taunted Young to {{face him}} {{so that he could}} repeat his {{performance}} against Boston's ace. Three days later, Young pitched a perfect game against Waddell and the Athletics. It was the first perfect game in American League history. Waddell was the 27th and last batter, and when he flied out, Young shouted, [...] "How do you like that, you hayseed?" [...] Waddell had picked an inauspicious time to issue his challenge. Young's perfect game was the centerpiece of a pitching streak. Young set major league records for the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched and the most consecutive innings without allowing a hit; the latter record still stands at 25.1 innings, or 76 hitless batters. Even after allowing a hit, Young's scoreless streak reached a then-record 45 shutout innings. Before Young, only two pitchers had thrown perfect games. This occurred in 1880, when Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward pitched perfect games within five days of each other, although under somewhat different rules: the front edge of the pitcher's box was only [...] from home base (the modern release point is about [...] farther away); walks required eight balls; and pitchers were obliged to throw side-armed. Young's perfect game was the first under the modern rules established in 1893. One year later, on July 4, 1905, Rube Waddell beat Young and the Americans, 42, in a 20-inning matchup. Young pitched 13 consecutive scoreless innings before he gave <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of unearned runs in the final inning. Young did not walk a batter and was later quoted: [...] "For my part, I think it was the greatest game of ball I ever took part in." [...] In 1907, Young and Waddell faced off in a scoreless 13-inning tie.|$|E

500|$|The video {{starts with}} a news anchor (played by Kristina Mitchell) saying {{the title of the}} song above a news banner that reads [...] "Britney Spears song lyrics spell out {{obscenity}} in disguise". This is a parody of an America's Newsroom report by Megyn Kelly. It then skips to a house, in which a sex party is coming to an end. Spears starts singing while {{sitting on the edge of}} a bed while the people that surround her are getting dressed. She gets up and looks out the window. As the first verse ends, she picks <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of panties from the floor, recalling her personal struggles and the [...] "Piece of Me" [...] video. She dances with four male dancers in the first chorus. During the second chorus, she dances with four other female dancers dressed in cheerleading outfits, while many men are watching them dance. The screen fades to white and Spears begins to change into a conservative '50s-inspired housewife outfit. As the chorus begins again, she comes out of her bedroom. She walks down the stairs, with dancers surrounding her and a woman gives her a potholder, which she uses to pick up a pie. After this, she walks out the front door of the house and is joined by her seemingly conservative-looking husband and children, one of them dressed with the schoolgirl outfit Spears wore in the [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] video. As they go down the walkway, they are surrounded by paparazzi, who have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. While the kids and husband wave, Spears smiles for the camera and blows a kiss. The video then ends with the news anchor saying, [...] "Doesn't make any sense, does it?".|$|E

2500|$|In-ear {{monitors}} offer considerable isolation for {{the performer}} using them, {{meaning that the}} monitor engineer can craft a much more accurate and clear mix for the performer. With in-ear monitors, each performer can be sent their own customized mix; although {{this was also the}} case with monitor speakers, the in-ear monitors of one performer cannot be heard by the other musicians. A downside of this isolation is that the performer cannot hear the crowd or the comments other performers on stage that do not have microphones (e.g., if the bass player wishes to communicate to the drummer).

Vigar and his Essex team mates faced the Australians in Southend-on-Sea on 15 May. Vigar collected two wickets for 66 runs during the Australians only innings, however one over bowled before lunch has subsequently entered Essex Club folklore.
