Later Chirbury was a rural district (from 1894 to 1934) — the Chirbury Rural District. The hundred included a detached township near Clun — Guilden Down. In 1987 the parishes of Chirbury and Brompton and Rhiston merged to form the present-day civil parish of Chirbury with Brompton. Historically Cherbury was the more <b>usual</b> <b>spelling</b> of Chirbury.|$|E

2500|$|Until Joseph Bramah {{patented}} {{the beer}} engine in 1785, beer was served {{directly from the}} barrel and carried to the customer. The Old English [...] ("carry; pull") developed {{into a series of}} related words including drag, draw, and draught. By the time Bramah's beer pumps became popular, {{the use of the term}} draught to refer to the acts of serving or drinking beer was well established and transferred easily to beer served via the hand pumps. In time, the word came to be restricted to only such beer. The <b>usual</b> <b>spelling</b> is now [...] "draught" [...] in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand and more commonly [...] "draft" [...] in North America, although it can be spelt either way. Regardless of spelling, the word is pronounced [...] or [...] depending on the region the speaker is from.|$|E
2500|$|Webster's 1828 {{dictionary}} {{had only}} -or and is given {{much of the}} credit for the adoption of this form in the United States. By contrast, Johnson's 1755 (pre-U.S. independence and establishment) dictionary used -our for all words still so spelled in Britain (like colour), but also for words where the u has since been dropped: ambassadour, emperour, governour, perturbatour, inferiour, superiour; errour, horrour, mirrour, tenour, terrour, tremour. Johnson, unlike Webster, was not an advocate of spelling reform, but chose the spelling best derived, as he saw it, from among the variations in his sources. He preferred French over Latin spellings because, as he put it, [...] "the French generally supplied us". English speakers who moved to America took these preferences with them, and H. L. Mencken notes that [...] " [...] appears in the 1776 Declaration of Independence, but it seems to have got there rather by accident than by design. In Jefferson's original draft it is spelled [...] "honour". In Britain, examples of [...] rarely appear in Old Bailey court records from the 17th and 18th centuries, whereas there are thousands of examples of their -our counterparts. One notable exception is [...] [...] and [...] were equally frequent in Britain until the 17th century; honor still is, in the UK, the <b>usual</b> <b>spelling</b> as a person's name and appears in Honor Oak, a district of London.|$|E

His performance, described as [...] "the real key" [...] to {{what makes the}} film work, credits him with using [...] "his <b>usual</b> <b>spell</b> in subtle gradations." [...] Varietys Todd McCarthy praised his performance, saying he [...] "expressively alternates between enthusiasm and forlorn disappointment in the manner Jack Lemmon could". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said the movie [...] "hits you like a blast of pure romantic oxygen" [...] and credited both lead actors for playing [...] "it for real, with a grasp of subtlety and feeling {{that goes beyond the}} call of breezy duty."

The <b>usual</b> proofs <b>spell</b> things out more explicitly (and in fact, our proof of Proposition  3.12 is extracted from the standard proofs of Theorem  7.10).|$|R

5000|$|Because the Mandarin {{pronunciation}} of Shaanxi and {{its eastern}} neighbor Shanxi differ only in tone, their spelling in pinyin romanization differ only by tone marks (Shǎnxī and Shānxī, respectively).
