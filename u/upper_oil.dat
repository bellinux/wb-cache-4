Thermal decomposition of Gürün oil shales was studied by thermo-gravimetry (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and Rock Eval pyrolysis.

40|$|Abstract. In present casting industries, product {{development}} paradigm is shifting from traditional trial-and-error to proof-of-concept based on CAE-enabled simulation. In the new production development paradigm, CAE simulation {{plays an important}} role because it models the entire casting process and reveals the dynamic behavior of the casting system in working conditions. In this research, Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) simulation was performed by using the simulation software (AnyCasting) in order to optimize casting design of an automobile part (<b>Upper</b> <b>Oil</b> Pan) which is well known and complicated to achieve a good casting layout. The simulation results were analyzed and compared carefully in order to apply them into the production die-casting mold.

Sensitivity studies concluded that the gas-invaded and the oil-filled parts of the reservoir show only a weak contrast between their mechanical properties so that their interface might not appear in the seismic sections. Directional dip filtering of the seismic data underlines horizontal events crossing the dipping layer interfaces. Some of them can be interpreted as the gas/oil contact. A careful picking and mapping of these events reveal two accumulations of carbon dioxide on each side of a system of N-S faults, with slightly different gas/oil contact levels. Estimation of the gas volume and of the density leads to a rough estimate of the mass of CO 2 in place, indicating that about one third of the CO 2 injected was stored in the reservoir...|$|E

40|$|The Upper Ordovician Bad Cache Rapids and Churchill River {{groups and}} Red Head Rapids Formation of the Hudson Bay Basin are 180 – 300 m thick. These units are {{dominated}} by carbonate, but contain thin shales informally named “Boas River shale ” and “Sixteen Mile Brook shale”. The stratigraphy and hydrocarbon potential of the shale units are poorly understood. The organic-rich “Boas River shale ” and “Sixteen Mile Brook shale ” were discovered on Southampton Island about 40 year ago. However, there has been considerable debate surrounding these oil shales, which focused on fundamental issues such as: one, two or three oil shale intervals within the Ordovician sequence, their precise stratigraphic positions, their extension in the Hudson Bay offshore area, and their hydrocarbon potential.

40|$|A Liquid-Liquid Cylindrical Cyclone {{separator}} (LLCC) is {{a device}} {{used in the}} petroleum industry to separate the oil-water mixture obtained from the well. The use of this device has not been widespread {{due to the lack}} of tools for predicting its separation capability. This paper presents a numerical and experimental study of the fluid dynamic performance of this type of cylindrical cyclone separators. The use of numerical simulations would reduce the time and cost necessary to obtain information for predicting the behavior of the equipment. The objective of this study is to determine if CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) techniques are able to reproduce the behavior of a LLCC separator. The CFD software examined was ANSYS-CFX 5. 6 TM and numerical simulations were carried out using the dispersed model with oil as the dispersed phase. The oil and water mixture entering the separator is divided due to centrifugal and buoyancy forces in an <b>upper</b> (<b>oil</b> rich) exit and a bottom (water rich) exit. The separation capability is determined as the maximum amount of water removed from the mixture with the minimum amount of oil content in the water rich exit. The experiments were conducted in a transparent LLCC separator that allows the visualization of the mixture and the measurement of the oil content. Experiments were conducted for three variables: mixture velocity and water content at the entrance, and the split ratio. The split ratio is defined as the bottom exit flow rate divided by the water flow rate at the entrance. The results showed that CFD tools are able to reproduce the oil content obtained from the experiments for all analyzed conditions. Additionally, the mixture distribution images from numerical and experimental data showed good agreement. This study confirms the capacity of CFD tools for the multiphase flow analysis of LLCC separators...|$|E
40|$|Carbonaceous (black) Devonian gas shales {{underlie}} approximately {{two-thirds of}} Kentucky. In these shales, natural gas {{occurs in the}} intergranular and fracture porosity and is adsorbed on clay and kerogen surfaces. This is analogous to methane storage in coal beds, where CO 2 is preferentially adsorbed, displacing methane. Black shales may similarly desorb methane {{in the presence of}} CO 2. Drill cuttings from the Kentucky Geological Survey Well Sample and Core Library were sampled to determine both CO 2 and CH 4 adsorption isotherms. Sidewall core samples were acquired to investigate CO 2 displacement of methane. An elemental capture spectroscopy log was acquired to investigate possible correlations between adsorption capacity and mineralogy. Average random vitrinite reflectance data range from 0. 78 to 1. 59 (<b>upper</b> <b>oil</b> to wet gas and condensate hydrocarbon maturity range). Total organic content determined from acid-washed samples ranges from 0. 69 to 14 percent. CO 2 adsorption capacities at 400 psi range from a low of 14 scf/ton in less organic-rich zones to more than 136 scf/ton in the more organic-rich zones. There is a direct linear correlation between measured total organic carbon content and the adsorptive capacity of the shale; CO 2 adsorption capacity increases with increasing organic carbon content. Initial volumetric estimates based on these data indicate a CO 2 sequestration capacity of as much as 28 billion tons total in the deeper and thicker parts of the Devonian shales in Kentucky. In the Big Sandy Gas Field area of eastern Kentucky, calculations using the net thickness of shale with 4 percent or greater total organic carbon, indicate that 6. 8 billion tonnes of CO 2 could be sequestered in the five county area. Discounting the uncertainties in reservoir volume and injection efficiency, these results indicate that the black shales of Kentucky are a potentially large geologic sink for CO 2. Moreover, the extensive occurrence of gas shales in Paleozoic and Mesozoic basins across North America make them an attractive regional target for economic CO 2 storage and enhanced natural gas production...|$|E

40|$|Feeding quality pellets enhances animal performance. Therefore, a {{comprehensive}} study of steam conditioning and pelleting was undertaken to evaluate factors responsible for the structural properties of pellets. Various rations containing regular corn, high oil corn, soybean meal, and expelled soybean meal were pelleted. The effect of ingredients, steam conditioning pressure, and paddle configuration on pellet quality was evaluated. Increasing raw protein content increased pellet durability. An <b>upper</b> <b>oil</b> limit of 5 % (dry basis) could be obtained before detrimental effects on pellet quality were detected. Changing the residence time inside the conditioner by adjusting the paddle pitch increased pellet durability indices by up to 5 points. Mechanical strength {{in terms of the}} modulus of elasticity and failure stress of individual pellets was measured via three-point bending. A wide variation in pellet hardness was observed within a treatment. This data is important for future stochastic modeling and for developing quality control programs in feed manufacturing operations. Chemical changes of the primary nutrients due to processing also were evaluated. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies revealed no starch gelatinization occurred in the conditioning chamber and 36 % starch gelatinization was found in pelleted corn rations. The extent of protein thermal denaturation could not be detected using DSC because a representative sample of the original protein could not be obtained. SDS-PAGE was performed to determine possible protein-protein interactions resulting from processing. Small differences in band intensity were observed between processed and unprocessed samples. This suggests that a slight protein network had formed contributing to the cohesive characteristics of pellets. A 3 -D finite element model was developed that simulated fluid flow through a steam conditioner. Two paddle configurations and three rotational speeds were evaluated. The mash and steam were assumed to be a continuum and behave as a Newtonian-like fluid. Simulations showed a difference in flow (mixing) patterns due to different blade pitches. The flow patterns changed only slightly when the rotational speeds increased. However, the velocity, which {{is directly related to the}} residence time in an actual conditioner, increased significantly. This work may be applied to assessing optimal steam conditioner settings required to produce quality pellets. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{investigating}} natural resistance mechanisms, especially constitutive alk(en) ylresorcinols in different mango (Mangifera indica L.) varieties {{in relation to}} postharvest anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. and Sacc. Resistance to postharvest anthracnose was studied {{in a range of}} mango varieties grown in Australia including Kensington Pride, Celebration, Nam Doc Mai, Calypso, Honey Gold, R 2 E 2 , Kent, Keitt, and Sensation by comparing anthracnose lesion growth following inoculation with C. gloeosporioides (9. 5 × 106 spores/mL). All fruits were obtained from commercial orchards at the mature-green stage of development. Results on fruits not subjected to preharvest chemical sprays showed significant differences among the varieties in resistance to postharvest anthracnose. Varieties Keitt and Kensington Pride were classed as resistant, whereas R 2 E 2 , Nam Doc Mai, Kent, Calypso and Honey Gold were classed as susceptible. To gain some understanding of how resistance to anthracnose was maintained, concentrations of constitutive alk(en) ylresorcinols (5 -n-heptadecenylresorcinol and 5 -npentadecylresorcinol) in fruit peel were investigated in a range of varieties over 2 consecutive mango seasons. The variety Kensington Pride had the highest levels of 5 -nheptadecenylresorcinol (107. 27 - 123. 70 µg/g) and 5 -n-pentadecylresorcinol (6. 32 - 7. 99 µg/g) followed by Keitt (49. 90 - 61. 44 µg/g 5 -n-heptadecenylresorcinol and 3. 30 - 6. 05 µg/g 5 -n-pentadecylresorcinol). The susceptible varieties had much lower levels of both types of resorcinols. There were significant relationships between the levels of anthracnose (anthracnose lesion area, mm 2) following inoculation with C. gloeosporioides, and concentrations of alk(en) ylresorcinols, especially for 5 -npentadecylresorcinol (P < 0. 001, r 2 = 0. 69). The two types of alk(en) ylresorcinols in mango peel were also positively and strongly correlated with each other (P < 0. 001, r 2 = 0. 71). Retention of a 2 - 3 cm long peduncle, and sap, in Kensington Pride mango fruit, resulted in significantly smaller anthracnose lesions following inoculation with C. gloeosporioides compared with those fruits destemmed and 2 ̆ 7 desapped after harvest. The natural stem-end rot infections were also greatly reduced by not-desapping. Peel obtained from not-desapped fruits, had higher concentrations of alk(en) ylresorcinols compared with those obtained from the desapped fruit. Sap from a range of varieties collected at harvest was analysed over 2 consecutive seasons in order to investigate its physical and biochemical properties. Sap weight per fruit was the highest and the lowest in Celebration and Keitt, respectively. Keitt had the most acidic sap (pH 4. 36 - 4. 46) and Honey Gold had the least acidic sap (pH 4. 59 - 4. 67). Sap was extracted and was subsequently analysed for alk(en) ylresorcinols by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Kensington Pride and Keitt had the highest concentrations of the predominant 5 -n-heptadecenylresorcinol (12. 44 - 14. 09 mg/g and 6. 33 - 13. 04 mg/g), whereas Calypso had the highest concentration of 5 -n-pentadecylresorcinol (0. 61 - 0. 84 mg/g). The lowest concentrations of both resorcinols were found in Nam Doc Mai sap. The present study demonstrated that the non-aqueous phase (<b>upper</b> <b>oil</b> layer) of mango sap contained nearly all of the alk(en) resorcinols that were measured, and maturity (as indicated by dry matter contents of fruit pulp), was observed to influence the levels of non-aqueous sap, and ultimately the concentrations of constitutive alk(en) ylresorcinols.

30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the oil seal between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the oil seal edges of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and oil edge sealing, the oil chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>oil</b> pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and oil seal changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>oil</b> pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|R
