40|$|It {{has become}} common for {{low-voltage}} electricity distribution networks {{to be installed}} underground in new housing developments due {{to a number of}} advantages over overhead networks including improved appearance, reliability of supply and safety. This paper investigates the value of these benefits to households by estimating the relationship between the type of network service provided and house prices in three selected suburbs in the Australian Capital Territory. The presence of <b>underground</b> <b>networks</b> was found to increase house price by 2. 9 %.

5|$|A girl born at {{the station}} in 1924 was the first baby to be born on the <b>Underground</b> <b>network.</b> The Bakerloo line {{building}} remains much as originally constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The Northern line building was designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis, and was rebuilt several times until the current structure opened in 2003. Transport for London (TfL) is currently planning a major upgrade to the station. A Bakerloo line extension south to Camberwell was planned and approved in 1931 but construction never started. Similar proposals have been revived on several occasions; in 2014 TfL ran a consultation on an extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction, which is still under consideration.|$|E

5|$|Euston was poorly {{served by}} the early London <b>Underground</b> <b>network.</b> The nearest station on the Metropolitan line was Gower Street, around five minutes' walk away. A {{permanent}} connection did not appear until 12 May 1907, when the City & South London Railway opened an extension north from Angel. The Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway opened an adjacent station on 22 June in the same year; these two stations {{are now part of}} the Northern line. Gower Street station was quickly renamed Euston Square in response. A connection to the Victoria line opened on 1 December 1968.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, with {{a return}} to {{normality}} after the First World War, Pick began developing plans to extend the <b>Underground</b> <b>network</b> out into suburbs that lacked adequate transport services. The only major extensions made to the <b>Underground</b> <b>network</b> since the three tube lines had opened were {{the extension of the}} District Railway to Uxbridge in 1910, and the extension of the Bakerloo tube to Watford Junction between 1913 and 1917. Approved schemes put on hold during the war were revived: the CLR was extended to Ealing Broadway in 1920, the Hampstead tube was extended to Edgware between 1923 and 1924 and the C was reconstructed and extended to Camden Town between 1922 and 1924. Finance for the latter two extensions was obtained through the government's 1921 Trade Facilities Act which underwrote loans for public works as a means of alleviating unemployment. For new lines, Pick first considered extending Underground services to the north-east of London where the mainline suburban services of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and Great Eastern Railway (GER) were poor and unreliable. Studies were carried out for an extension of the Piccadilly tube on GNR tracks to New Barnet and Enfield or on a new route to Wood Green and plans were developed for an extension of the CLR along GER tracks to Chingford and Ongar, but both mainline companies strongly opposed the Underground's encroachment into their territories.|$|E
5|$|Pick had {{a strong}} {{interest}} in design and its use in public life. He steered the development of the London Underground's corporate identity by commissioning eye-catching commercial art, graphic design and modern architecture, establishing a highly recognisable brand, including the first versions of the roundel and typeface still used today. Under his direction, the UERL's <b>Underground</b> <b>network</b> and associated bus services expanded considerably reaching out into new areas and stimulating the growth of London's suburbs. His impact on the growth of London between the world wars led to him being likened to Baron Haussmann and Robert Moses.|$|E

5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of feeder lines to the <b>Underground</b> <b>network,</b> including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a difficult time economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built.

5|$|The {{station was}} {{built as a}} joint venture by the NLR and the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) {{in order to have}} a station serving freight closer to the City. It was {{immediately}} successful for both goods and passenger services and saw a significant increase in NLR traffic. Usage peaked in the early 20th century, after which it suffered from competition of London trams, buses, and particularly the London <b>Underground</b> <b>network.</b> Patronage gradually fell and services decreased, while the station building became increasingly dilapidated. By the 1980s, all freight services had been cancelled, and the station closed in 1986. The station building was replaced by Broadgate, an office and retail space, while part of the connecting line to the station was re-used as part of the London Overground.|$|E
5|$|By October 1914, many Ghadarites had {{returned}} to India and were assigned tasks like contacting Indian revolutionaries and organisations, spreading propaganda and literature, and arranging to get arms into the country. The first group of 60 Ghadarites led by Jawala Singh, left San Francisco for Canton aboard the steamship Korea on 29 August. They were to sail on to India, {{where they would be}} provided with arms to organise a revolt. At Canton, more Indians joined, and the group, now numbering about 150, sailed for Calcutta on a Japanese vessel. They were to be joined by more Ghadarites arriving in smaller groups. During September and October, about 300 Indians left for India in various ships like SS Siberia, Chinyo Maru, China, Manchuria, SS Tenyo Maru, SS Mongolia and SS Shinyo Maru. Although the Koreas party itself was uncovered and arrested on arrival at Calcutta, a successful <b>underground</b> <b>network</b> was established between the United States and India, through Shanghai, Swatow, and Siam. Tehl Singh, the Ghadar operative in Shanghai, is believed to have spent $30,000 for helping the revolutionaries to get into India. The Ghadarites in India were able to establish contact with sympathisers within the British Indian Army as well as build networks with underground revolutionary groups.|$|E

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks have {{received}} significant attention {{due to their}} capability for distributed sensing at relatively low cost, in applications which range from environmental to industrial monitoring. More recently, wireless <b>underground</b> sensor <b>networks</b> have been proposed for applications such as personnel tracking in underground mines and moisture monitoring for precision agriculture. Wireless <b>underground</b> sensor <b>networks</b> are typically categorised into wireless sensor networks for mines and tunnels (which communicate overthe- air) and Subsoil Wireless <b>underground</b> sensor <b>networks</b> (which communicate wirelessly through soil). For Subsoil wireless <b>underground</b> sensor <b>networks</b> specifically, {{it is well known}} that the soil medium introduces a number of challenges. Firstly, the path loss in soil is very high. Secondly, propagation characteristics are dependent on soil conditions and properties, which can change due to irrigation or rain. Thirdly, communication in Subsoil Wireless <b>underground</b> sensor <b>networks</b> takes place over three different types of channels: underground-to-underground, aboveground-to-underground and underground-toaboveground. Therefore, communication protocols developed for over-the-air wireless sensor networks are not suitable for wireless <b>underground</b> sensor <b>networks.</b> Although some studies on wireless <b>underground</b> sensor <b>networks</b> have focussed on channel characterization, many aspects related to link characteristics have not been thoroughly investigated. Understanding the link behaviour in wireless <b>underground</b> sensor <b>networks</b> is a fundamental building block for protocol development for medium access, topology management and routing. The aim of this research is to gain insight into the link quality in wireless <b>underground</b> sensor <b>networks</b> which can aid in the development of efficient and reliable communication protocols. To this end, the link quality in the three wireless <b>underground</b> sensor <b>network</b> communication channels is characterized empirically for dry and wet soil conditions. This characterization is performed using the received signal strength, link quality indicator and packet reception rate. The results show that links in the underground-to-underground channel are very stable (in terms of received signal strength) and exhibit high symmetry and high packet reception rate, even for received signal strength values near the receiver sensitivity, but the communication ranges are limited due to the very high attenuation. On the other hand, links in the aboveground-to-underground /underground-to-aboveground channels are typically asymmetric and have longer communication ranges. For most links in all three channels, it is observed that the link quality indicator is highly variant and is not correlated with received signal strength and packet reception ratio. Furthermore, an increase in the soil moisture also affects the link asymmetry and the width of the transitional windows in the aboveground-to-underground/underground-to-aboveground channels. The results show that efficient communication protocols for wireless <b>underground</b> sensor <b>networks</b> will have to be highly adaptive/reactive to soil conditions, and link quality estimation has to be robust to the asymmetry present in most links.
