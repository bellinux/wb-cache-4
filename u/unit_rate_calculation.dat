40|$|The paper {{sets out}} {{problems}} experienced in current power plant performance calculation methodology. With {{changes in the}} electricity market and the increased role of computer control and diagnostic system, the previ-ous methodology is fast becoming obsolete. Several key factors are highlighted (for example, reference values and corrective curves) which may lead to highly imprecise and inadequate evaluations of plant performance and, especially, operator behavior. It is important {{to bear in mind}} the systemic changes on the energy mar-ket. The current methodology focuses on controlling factors impacting power generating efficiency whereas the modern market is more complex and real costs are largely dependent on other variable costs, such as environmental fees, equipment wearing costs and the energy trading market. Statistical analysis of data is proposed as a modification of the current methodology. As most heat <b>rate</b> <b>calculation</b> is done on-line, it is possible to analyze this data in detail and apply, for example, PCA (Principle Component Analysis) and linear (and nonlinear) regression, thereby enabling a more accurate determination of the influence of principle process parameters on heat rate deviation. The article presents sample results of comprehensive analysis (two cases from different plants) of two twin <b>units</b> (heat <b>rate</b> <b>calculation</b> and process data analysis from a 12 -month period) which to demonstrate the clear need to modify and update the old performance calculation approach. 1...|$|R

40|$|Route {{charges are}} fees that {{airlines}} pay {{in order to}} utilize the Air Navigation Services (ANS) of a European state. The fee is based on three values; {{the weight of the}} aircraft, the length of the flight, and the state’s specific <b>unit</b> <b>rate.</b> The <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> of each state is in turn based on the forecasted costs of providing ANS for that state and the amount of traffic forecasted for the year to come. This makes for different <b>unit</b> <b>rates</b> for different states, which leads to different costs for flying different routes in the European airspace. A state having costs that are increasing faster than the amount of traffic is increasing will lead to a higher <b>unit</b> <b>rate.</b> A higher <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> may lead to airlines avoiding the state’s airspace due to higher costs, thus accounting for even less traffic and an increase in <b>unit</b> <b>rate.</b> This thesis examines the relationship between <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> and amount of traffic, and specifically tries to find out how much the <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> affects the traffic count. This has been done by reading previous papers on the subject, and creating a model to easily present facts found. The result of the thesis suggests that states actually profits more by increasing the <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> rather than actively trying to reduce it. This contradicts the idea of lowering prices always being a good thing. There is a limit to how much the <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> can be increases however, at which all traffic will choose to circumnavigate the airspace. Finding a good balance between traffic lost and <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> increased is suggested as the best way to go...|$|R

Four different look-up tables have been generated with the combinations of two different scalar dissipation <b>rate</b> <b>calculation</b> methods and two different mass diffusion models of the opposed jet flame. Simulation of a turbulent non-premixed H 2 jet flame is used to discriminate the accuracy of different implementation methods by comparison with experimental data.
