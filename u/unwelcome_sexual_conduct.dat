However, she did not address to Taylor or higher authority, because {{she was afraid of}} dismissal. Meritor Savings Bank vs. Vinson case ruled that hostile environment is considered a violation of Title VII. This decision [...] "legitimized this area of the law for complainants and, for the first time, put employers on notice that <b>unwelcome</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>conduct</b> will not be tolerated in the workplace."

Advances made by faculty toward students or by supervisors toward subordinates unfairly exploit the power inherent in those relationships. <b>Unwelcome</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>conduct</b> between students interferes with the ability to participate in and benefit from University programs. In both obvious and subtle ways, the very possibility of sexual assault or harassment can be deeply destructive to individual members of our community and can poison their academic and career relationships.

40|$|In a {{developing}} country like India, {{with more and more}} influx of women into professions, which were conventionally and comparatively monopolized by men, the sexual harassment at workplace is gradually surfacing and women have started experiencing the intensity of its bites. The problem has become grave because labour market, as a result of women participation has registered both qualitative and quantitative change.

40|$|This article {{provides}} a quick history of sexual-harassment law {{and looks at}} the appellate-court opinions that came before the U. S. Supreme Court ruling in a same-sex sexual-harassment case. That latter decision has given rise to the relatively novel equal-opportunity-harasser defense, whereby harassing conduct directed at both men and women, no matter how outrageous, may not be unlawful at all. The reason is that the Supreme Court previously established that sexual harassment must be 2 ̆ 2 because of sex, 2 ̆ 2 and failure to prove that gender-related component will automatically disqualify claims for quid pro quo or hostile-work-environment sexual harassment, as indicated by the court decisions outlined in this article.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} if higher {{education}} institutions are going to place students at risk of sexual harassment by requiring they complete a component of their formal study on work-place based placements, then university educators {{have a responsibility to}} adequately equip and appropriately support students so they can effectively identify and respond to sexual harassment. A model from youth work field education is presented that aims to prepare graduates, agency supervisors and university-based field education staff who are capable and motivated to prevent and respond to sexual harassment in the practicum. The systemic and integrated framework recognises student&# 039;s fundamental right to safety in the workplace and attends to the constraints on students disclosing, the deleterious effects of experiencing unwanted sexual conduct, and the importance of good practices in care and support. The various components of the approach also take account of the influence of environmental factors as well as issues of educational merit. The model has general applicability to other professional practice domains and can be adapted for use by educators who appreciate the value of equipping students to effectively deal with <b>unwelcome</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>conduct</b> while on placement...|$|E
