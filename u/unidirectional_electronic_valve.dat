A <b>unidirectional</b> <b>electronic</b> structure with a period of $a_{ 0 }$ (where $a_{ 0 }$ is the lattice constant) along the a-axis is observed.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the energy consumption of an <b>electronic</b> <b>valve</b> and a classical thermostatic valve has been compared when these expansion valves are adopted in a vapour compression plant subjected to a cold store. The main aim is to verify experimentally which type of expansion valve would be preferable from energy point of view when a classical thermostat or a fuzzy logic algorithm are used as the control system for the refrigeration capacity. The fuzzy logic-based control is able to modulate continuously the compressor speed through an inverter. The results show that with a fuzzy algorithm, the thermostatic expansion valve allows an energy saving of about 8 % {{in comparison with the}} <b>electronic</b> <b>valve.</b> When on–off control is used, the electric energy consumption obtained both with the <b>electronic</b> <b>valve</b> and with the thermostatic valve is comparable...|$|R

40|$|Adopting <b>electronic</b> {{expansion}} <b>valves</b> in {{air conditioners}} enables an appreciable energy saving {{with respect to}} the same installations equipped with traditional thermostatic expansion valves. This {{is due to the fact}} that <b>electronic</b> <b>valves</b> allow a lower condensation pressure in systems equipped with air cooled condensers, which is adjusted to variations in outside air temperature. Furthermore, PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control over the superheating leads to the best use of evaporator under every condition (lower superheating level of the vapour refrigerant), thus increasing the refrigerating capacity. This paper reports on the results of a set of measurements that were carried out from March to November 2006 on the operation of eight direct expansion air conditioners having a total cooling capacity of 120 kW installed at a telephone control room near Bologna (North Italy).

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{energetic}} and economic comparison between electronic and thermostatic expansion valve in a centralized refrigeration plant of a supermarket. Adopting <b>electronic</b> expansion <b>valves</b> enables an appreciable energy saving, {{due to the fact}} that <b>electronic</b> <b>valves</b> allow a lower condensation pressure in systems equipped with air cooled condensers, which is adjusted to variations in outside air temperature. Furthermore, superheating at the evaporator is lower and more stable, increasing cooling capacity and decreasing refrigerant temperature at the compressor discharge (the latter assures better efficiency and lower wear and tear for the compressor). This study is supported by an experimental work where the cabinets of a supermarket, located in the northern Italy, have been equipped with both thermostatic and <b>electronic</b> expansion <b>valves,</b> alternatively activated by solenoid valves on a daily basis, in order to compare the two systems in the same environment and at similar load conditions. A campaign of measurements has been carried out that extended for several months whose results were recently presented. This allowed to build a simulation model of the application to evaluate the performance, energy and economic savings in different climates. Energetic analysis considers total electrical consumptions (compressors, fans and electrical switchboards), whose reduction with <b>electronic</b> <b>valve</b> was always accompanied by a better temperature set point maintenance inside the cabinets...|$|R

40|$|Background: Efficiency {{of a water}} {{management}} and irrigation control system is important for improved production and quality of crops. <b>Electronic</b> <b>valve</b> {{is one of the}} most important components for the irrigation management system, and the performance is characterized by the flow-pressure relationships. In the study, a test bench was developed to test <b>electronic</b> <b>valves</b> for irrigation management systems. Methods: A multistage pump (Model: DRL 10 - 8; DOOCH, Korea), flow rate sensors (Model: E-MAG-I, AUTOFLOW, Korea), and pressure sensors (Model: A- 10; WIKA, Germany) were used to construct the test bench. A control program was coded to control the pump operation. The flow rate was set at four different levels (20, 40, 60, 80 m 3 /h) using the multistage pump. Flow rate and pressure sensors were installed before and after the test electric valve. Data were collected through a wireless sensor network. The electric valve was controlled remotely by the software developed using C # (visual studio 2010, USA). Results& discussion: The experimental results showed that the error ranges were 2 % at 20 m 3 /h and 7 % at 80 m 3 /h. We found that the flow rate within 20 ~ 80 m 3 /h and the pressure loss within 2 ~ 10 bar measured before and after the electric valve were linearly plotted. The pressure decreased 10 % before and after the solenoid valve. The delay time need to be considered for stable flow control. To solve this problem, relief valve was installed to remove the flow rate exceeding the specified value. Conclusion: The test bench should a favourable performance, and will be used to test and compare <b>electronic</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{method to}} {{determine}} the condensing temperature set point of air-cooled refrigeration system with an <b>electronic</b> expansion <b>valve</b> was discussed in this paper. This set point is fixed for a specific system {{and is based on}} the flow characteristic of the installed <b>electronic</b> expansion <b>valve</b> in variant opening and pressure drop. As common sense, at constant differential between condensing pressure and evaporating pressure, larger opening of expansion valve allows more refrigerant flowing through the expansion valve into evaporator. This feature offers an opportunity to lower the condensing temperature via increasing opening of expansion valve to enhance refrigeration efficiency and in the same time designed cooling capacity can be maintained at low ambient temperature. In this case it is supposed that the installed <b>electronic</b> expansion <b>valve’s</b> capacity was larger than the evaporator’s, and in fact that occurs frequently in refrigeration system designing. The benefits of this method could include: the capacity of <b>electronic</b> expansion <b>valve</b> is fully utilized, the refrigeration system will operate at a lower condensing pressure and the power consumption of compressor can decrease, hence the improvement of system efficiency is predictable...|$|R
5000|$|Once {{more fully}} developed, <b>electronic</b> <b>valve</b> {{operation}} will yield even more benefits. Cylinder deactivation, for instance, {{could be made}} much more fuel efficient if the intake valve could be opened on every downstroke and the exhaust valve opened on every upstroke of the deactivated cylinder or [...] "dead hole". Another even more significant advancement will be {{the elimination of the}} conventional throttle. When a car is run at part throttle, this interruption in the airflow causes excess vacuum, which causes the engine to use up valuable energy acting as a vacuum pump. BMW attempted to get around this on their V-10 powered M5, which had individual throttle butterflies for each cylinder, placed just before the intake <b>valves.</b> With <b>electronic</b> <b>valve</b> operation, {{it will be possible to}} control engine speed by regulating valve lift. At part throttle, when less air and gas are needed, the valve lift would not be as great. Full throttle is achieved when the gas pedal is depressed, sending an electronic signal to the ECU, which in turn regulates the lift of each valve event, and opens it all the way up.|$|R

The unidirectional transport behavior, characterized by the asymmetric colossal enhancement in differential conductivity at a modest current application of 10 - 15 μA, persists to T = 300 K in honeycomb lattice of thickness 6 nm. The asymmetric behavior arises without the application of magnetic field. A qualitative analysis of experimental data suggests the role of magnetic charge or monopoles in the unusual observations with strong implication for spintronics.
