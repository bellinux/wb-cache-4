5|$|Parabronchi {{in which}} the air flow is <b>unidirectional</b> are called paleopulmonic parabronchi and are found in all birds. Some birds, however, have, in addition, a lung {{structure}} where the air flow in the parabronchi is bidirectional. These are termed neopulmonic parabronchi.|$|E
5|$|Thunderbolt {{combines}} PCI Express and Mini DisplayPort {{into a new}} {{serial data}} interface. Original Thunderbolt implementations have two channels, each with a transfer speed of 10Gbit/s, resulting in an aggregate <b>unidirectional</b> bandwidth of 20Gbit/s.|$|E
5|$|Both {{crocodilians}} {{and monitor}} lizards have developed lungs {{similar to those}} of birds, providing an <b>unidirectional</b> airflow and even possessing air sacs. The now extinct pterosaurs have seemingly even further refined this type of lung, extending the airsacs into the wing membranes and, in the case of lonchodectids, tupuxuara, and azhdarchoids, the hindlimbs.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{moves in}} a single outward {{direction}} from the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space. Fluid movement is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the beating of the heart. Some authors dispute this, posing {{that there is no}} <b>unidirectional</b> CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic to-and-fro cranio-spinal CSF movements.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with airflow {{moving in and}} out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds, with airflow moving in a <b>unidirectional</b> loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and into two primary bronchi, or airways, which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have <b>unidirectional</b> airflow without the aid of avian-like air sacs.|$|E
5|$|In {{physics and}} fluid mechanics, a Blasius {{boundary}} layer (named after Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius) describes the steady two-dimensional {{laminar boundary layer}} that forms on a semi-infinite plate which is held parallel to a constant <b>unidirectional</b> flow. Falkner and Skan later generalized Blasius' solution to wedge flow (Falkner–Skan boundary layer), i.e. flows in which the plate is not parallel to the flow.|$|E
5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry to situations where forces {{can be attributed to the}} presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies, and thus that there is no such thing as a <b>unidirectional</b> force or a force that acts on only one body.|$|E
5|$|Orthogenesis was the {{hypothesis}} that life has an innate tendency to change, in a unilinear fashion, towards ever-greater perfection. It had a significant following in the 19th century, and its proponents included the Russian biologist Leo S. Berg and the American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn. Orthogenesis was popular among some paleontologists, who believed that the fossil record showed a gradual and constant <b>unidirectional</b> change.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the nasal {{chambers}} of Ankylosaurus indicate that airflow was <b>unidirectional,</b> (looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation), although it {{may also have been}} bidirectional in the posterior nasal chamber, which directed air past the olfactory lobes. The enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a well-developed sense of smell, and the position of the orbits of Ankylosaurus suggest some stereoscopic vision.|$|E
5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of a}} Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming <b>unidirectional</b> flow and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|At Main Street, Church Street splits {{into a pair}} of one-way {{streets and}} becomes North and South Division Street. The route follows South Division eastward for two blocks to an {{intersection}} with Ellicott Street located one block north of Coca-Cola Field. At the junction, which includes the northern terminus of NY16, NY5 turns northward, rejoining NY5 westbound one block later at North Division. The route continues on Ellicott for nine blocks to the <b>unidirectional</b> East Tupper Street, where NY5 westbound separates from the route once more. NY5 eastbound, however, continues north on Ellicott for an additional block to the one-way Goodell Street. NY5 heads west on Goodell for two blocks before turning north onto Main Street, rejoining NY5 westbound at the intersection.|$|E
5|$|The perforant path is {{the main}} output pathway of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The flow of {{information}} in the hippocampus is largely <b>unidirectional.</b> Axons from the pyramidal cells (in EC layer II) perforate the subiculum to project mainly to the granular layer in the dentate gyrus (first synaptic connection). Some axons project to CA3 and a lesser number project to CA1. The dentate granule cell axons, called mossy fibers, pass on the information, to the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (second synaptic connection). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1. Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex (third synaptic connection) completing the trisynaptic loop or circuit.|$|E
5|$|The trams were <b>unidirectional</b> and had {{a single}} door at the front and a double door in the middle, both on the right side. Class E also had a single door at the rear. The trams were {{originally}} delivered with two apartments, with a wall and inside door {{in front of the}} centre door. This was removed after the trams became smoke-free. They had a partial wooden interior, with linoleum floors. Various renovations changed the panelling, usually variations of brown and yellow. The trams originally had incandescent light bulbs, but these were replaced with fluorescent lamps after 1955. From 1970 to 1974, the trams were rebuilt to remove the conductor, and the driver was given space for a purse and ticket machine, as well as an announcement system. The E-series eventually had the rear door taken out of use and blocked with an extra seat.|$|E
5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a <b>unidirectional</b> flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E

25|$|One can regard loyalty {{programs}} {{as a form}} of centralized virtual currency, one with <b>unidirectional</b> cash flow, since reward points can be exchanged into a good or service but not back into cash.|$|E
25|$|During the plant's growth period, usually {{during the}} spring, storage organs {{such as the}} roots are sugar sources, and the plant's many growing areas are sugar sinks. The {{movement}} in phloem is multidirectional, whereas, in xylem cells, it is <b>unidirectional</b> (upward).|$|E
25|$|This type of cytoplasmic {{incompatibility}} {{where an}} infected male cannot reproduce successfully with an uninfected female is called <b>unidirectional</b> cytoplasmic incompatibility. It occurs because Wolbachia modifies the paternal chromosomes during sperm development, leading to complications for these offspring during embryonic development.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{four types}} of CRIDs are playing {{a major role in}} some <b>unidirectional</b> {{television}} networks: programme CRID, series CRID, group CRID, and recommendation CRID. One of the most important applications of CRIDs is the so-called series link recording function (SL) of modern digital video recorders (DVR, PVR).|$|E
25|$|Non dialogical (<b>unidirectional.</b> For example, presenters on TV are {{not able}} to adapt their {{discourse}} to the reactions of the audience, since they are visible to a wide audience but that audience is not directly visible to them. However, internet allows a bigger interactivity).|$|E
25|$|Runway 14/32, which officially {{opened to}} air traffic on November 23, 2006, is <b>unidirectional.</b> Runway 32 {{is used for}} {{landings}} and 14 is used for takeoffs. Massport is barred by a court order from using the runway for overland landings or takeoffs, except in emergencies.|$|E
25|$|With {{the second}} series {{delivered}} the SM53 units entered service {{on most of}} street tram lines. Two exceptions were the Kampen Line and the Vestbanen Line, both which were built for the older narrow profile {{and could not be}} used by the wider trams. As the trams were <b>unidirectional</b> they required a balloon loop at the ends of each line, which was also lacking on the Kampen Line, and new track arrangement had to be built at Vålerenga Depot and Majorstuen Depot. The issue was availed by the 1957 opening of Grefsen Depot, which was built for <b>unidirectional</b> trams. The MBO50 units were rebuilt in 1959, whereby the back door was closed and the received the same interior as the new trams, with single seats all the way along the door side.|$|E
25|$|The ancestral dinosaur was a biped. The {{evolution}} of a quadrupedal posture occurred four times, among the ancestors of Euornithopoda, Thyreophora, Ceratopsia and Sauropodomorpha. In all four cases this was associated {{with an increase in}} body size, and in all four cases the trend is <b>unidirectional</b> without reversal.|$|E
25|$|The {{capillaries}} are blind-ended, and {{the valves}} {{at the ends}} of capillaries use specialised junctions together with anchoring filaments to allow a <b>unidirectional</b> flow to the primary vessels. The collecting lymphatics, however, act to propel the lymph by the combined actions of the intraluminal valves and lymphatic muscle cells.|$|E
25|$|Single Specific Primer-PCR (SSP-PCR): {{allows the}} {{amplification}} of double-stranded DNA {{even when the}} sequence information is available at one end only. This method permits amplification of genes for which only a partial sequence information is available, and allows <b>unidirectional</b> genome walking from known into unknown regions of the chromosome.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{algorithms}} were {{suggested for}} {{different kind of}} network graphs, such as undirected rings, <b>unidirectional</b> rings, complete graphs, grids, directed Euler graphs, and others. A general method that decouples {{the issue of the}} graph family from the design of the coordinator election algorithm was suggested by Korach, Kutten, and Moran.|$|E
25|$|The W3C Recommendation called XLink {{describes}} hyperlinks {{that offer}} a far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These extended links can be multidirectional, linking from, within, and between XML documents. It can also describe simple links, which are <b>unidirectional</b> and therefore offer no more functionality than hyperlinks in HTML.|$|E
25|$|The {{absolute}} {{refractory period}} is {{largely responsible for}} the <b>unidirectional</b> propagation of action potentials along axons. At any given moment, the patch of axon behind the actively spiking part is refractory, but the patch in front, not having been activated recently, is capable of being stimulated by the depolarization from the action potential.|$|E
25|$|This {{procedure}} depends {{mainly on}} the receiver’s connectivity. It is possible to make a basic distinction between <b>unidirectional</b> networks, where the receiver can only receive information through the broadcast channel, and bidirectional networks, where {{there is also a}} return channel through which the receiver can communicate with the outside (typically an Internet access).|$|E
