40|$|Banks were {{portrayed as}} the villains {{of the global}} {{financial}} crisis; many of the big international banks and their executives were associated with greed and excessive risk-taking. Regulators were obliged to step in with unprecedented rescue packages to save the financial systems in the US, the UK and, to a lesser extent, the major European countries. Australia was also affected but fortunately, the Australian banking system survived relatively unscathed.   There is now a view that Australians were protected from the crisis because of the financial strength and profitability of the banks and that profitable banks provide a range of other benefits to the Australian community. However, this paper puts the view that Australian banks are too profitable and that their excess profits are being made {{at the expense of}} the Australian community. The paper estimates the <b>underlying</b> <b>profits</b> of the banks to remove the impact of the global financial crisis but, as the crisis passes, actual profits will again reflect <b>underlying</b> <b>profits.</b>   The estimates in this paper suggest that the big four banks alone make <b>underlying</b> <b>profits</b> of around $ 35 billion before tax, of which some $ 20 billion per annum is likely to reflect the banks’ exploitation of their monopoly over the Australian payments system.   Image: megawatts 86 / flick...|$|R

40|$|Much of the {{research}} on entrepreneurship in the public sector focuses on academic institutions (e. g. Jones-Evans, Steward, Balazs & Todorov, 1998), or government organisations at the local or regional level (Teske & Schneider, 1994). One form of public sector firm that has received little attention, however, is state-owned enterprises (SOEs). While these public sector firms have traditionally provided core services on a national scale with an <b>underlying</b> <b>profit</b> motive, market forces and industry deregulation have increasingly exposed SOEs to competitive and commercial operations in both national and international markets. Hence the importance of entrepreneurial and strategic activity as a means of survival, sustainability, and growth emerges.

The exact disclosure requirement and format will depend on the relevant accounting standards under which the accounts were prepared (e.g. IFRS, US GAAP, UK GAAP). It may also be required to show foreign tax charges separately, so that the current tax items only relate to tax in the home country (this is the case under UK GAAP, for example). Foreign tax may also have current and prior year elements, and foreign tax may arise on the same <b>underlying</b> <b>profits</b> as domestic tax (where there is double taxation).|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{compliance}} with voluntary underlying profit-reporting guidelines in Australia. Underlying profits are {{a modification of}} the statutory profit figure, arguably to reflect the result for ongoing business activities. Such profit figures are known by many names, including ‘pro-forma earnings’, ‘alternative earnings’ and ‘adjusted earnings’. It is argued that adoption of voluntary underlying profit-reporting guidelines promotes higher disclosure quality by increasing transparency and consistency. In accordance with Legitimacy and Institutional Theories, disclosure quality {{is expected to have}} a positive association with the extent of social pressure to which a firm is subjected. Extent of social pressure is proxied by three attributes: general public exposure due to firm size, firm political exposure in the media and legitimacy of the firm’s industry. In the analysis, quality is measured according to degree of {{compliance with}} the seven AICD/FINSIA <b>underlying</b> <b>profit</b> principles. We examine how social pressures, which companies face due to their size, industry, and media exposure, determine the level of disclosure quality. To test the hypotheses developed in this study, we use a proportional stratified random sample of 50 ASX listed companies that reported a non-statutory profit figure within their annual earnings announcements for the financial year ended 2010. We find that high quality disclosure is primarily associated with political pressure in the media. However, no support has been found for the hypothesis that firms subject to a greater visibility due to their size increase reporting quality. Further, it appears that industry legitimacy does not {{play a significant role in}} determining firm legitimacy. Divergent from evidence on emerging industries, the absence of this association may be interpreted as reflecting that the importance of industry legitimacy to company legitimacy is a unique phenomenon applying to companies in new industries and not mature industries. Finally, results reveal that signaling superior performance and strong corporate governance may yield alternative explanations for <b>underlying</b> <b>profit</b> quality...|$|E
40|$|A {{multinational}} {{deciding on}} where to locate a foreign production facility may not be indifferent to the choice of location. Numerous variables such as production costs, market access, and local tax treatments will influence the decision as to where the plant is located. Another key variable in this decision is uncertainty. Following the work of Dixit, a firm has an option to make a risky investment, and if this investment is at least partially irreversible, the option has some positive value. As the uncertainty in the investment project increases, so too does {{the value of the}} option. When comparing two investment projects that are identical in all respects except their <b>underlying</b> <b>profit</b> volatility, the one with the greater degree of uncertainty will require a higher trigger level of profits to be exercised. This paper examines the impact of uncertainty in exchange rates on a multinational. s decision to locate within or outside a currency union. The option values and trigger levels of investment within and outside the union are derived as a function of exchange rate variances and correlations, transport costs, and market size. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{private sector}} {{has been using}} various systems to manage {{performance}} since the 1970 s, from around {{about the time that}} I joined the civil service. I have throughout my career experienced the civil service approach to managing people with a range of responses that stretched from fascination, through bewilderment and on to frustration. There were many periods of admiration along the journey, but they tended to relate to exceptional individuals who seemed to intuitively know how best to deal with staff, without the guidance of a formal policy or system. And all the time I harboured a sneaking admiration, sometimes bordering on envy, for my counterparts in the self-styled "real world" of the private sector, who enjoyed all the benefits of cutting-edge management thinking and practice - clarity of focus, borne of the <b>underlying</b> <b>profit</b> motive; staff managed professionally; no tolerance of below-par performance; or so I presumed. And so, when the civil service "borrowed" the concept of performance management from the private sector, I anticipated that there would be significant changes for the better in the way the civil service managed and performed.
