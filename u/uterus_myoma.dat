However during the surgery a dermoid teratoma of the right ovary was detected so it was removed together with tumor and there were two thickenings on the greater omentum, suspicious of inflammation, whereas one grew together with the front abdominal wall. Due to these conditions, she had partial omentectomy done and omentum was sent for path histological examination. The path histological examination confirmed it to be actinomycosis.

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative characteristics of women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy in the absence of uterine prolapse. Methods: A prospective, descriptive, quantitative, noncomparative study was conducted in 117 women between August 2009 and February 2011 in Petropolis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The women included had a uterine indication for hysterectomy, their surgeries were performed by the same team, and they were followed up for 12 months. An adapted Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system was used to check for uterine prolapse. Results: The age range of the women was 33 &ndash; 59 years, uterine volume was 300 &ndash; 900 mL, and 73. 50 % has undergone prior cesarean section. The main indication for hysterectomy was uterine myoma (64. 95 %), with a surgery time of 30 &ndash; 60 minutes in 55 (59. 82 %) and 19 (15. 98 %) cases, respectively. Uterine volume reduction was performed in 41 (35. 05 %) cases, salpingectomy was the most common associated surgery (81. 19 %), and anesthesia was subdural (68. 37 %). Common intraoperative complications included bladder lesions (8. 54 %), with conversion to the abdominal route being necessary in one case (1. 28 %), and the most common postoperative complication being vaginal cupola granuloma (32. 47 %). There was a statistically significant relationship between surgery time and uterine volume (&chi; 2 = 17. 367; P = 0. 002).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to observe the results of adenomyosis mangement with resection and administration of aromatase inhibitor. Cases of ademyosis in infertile women were collected for three years (January 1999 to December 2001) and the diagnoses were confirmed using transvaginal USG. Cases were grouped into two groups, i. e. group 1 (undergoing laparotomic resection) and group 2 (receiving treatment with aromatase inhibitor of anastrozole). Both groups were evaluated for changes in clinical symptoms, rate of successful pregnancy, and postoperative recurrency rate. During three years as many as 1619 infertility cases were managed, and among which 66 (4. 07 %) cases of adenomyosis were diagnosed with transvaginal USG. As many as 55 cases were analyzed, i. e., 32 cases underwent resection and 23 cases received aromatase inhibitor. Of 32 cases of surgical resection, the histopathological results showed 30 (93. 75 %) cases of adenomyosis and 2 (6. 25 %) cases of <b>uterus</b> <b>myoma.</b> In the group undergoing resection three cases (9. 4 %) were successfully pregnant, i. e., two cases had live birth, one case ended up with 6 -week abortion. Moreover, 25 (78. 1 %) cases were not pregnant and 4 (12. 5 %) cases had recurrency, while 24 (75. 35 %) cases experienced disappearance of symptoms yet not pregnant. On the other hand, of 23 cases in the group receiving aromatase inhibitor 2 (8. 6 %) cases were able to be pregnant, one case had live birth and another case ended up with abortion, while 14 (59. 1 %) cases had disappearance of symptoms yet not pregnant. During three months of treatment with aromatase inhibitor, a reduction in the lesion size between 7. 31 mm 3 and 25. 90 mm 3 were observed with CI 95 % (p < 0. 001). In conclusion, treatment with aromatase inihibitor did not heal lesions, but only reduced the size of adenomyosis lesions. On the other hand, resection could heal lesions, yet recurrency of disease may occur (12. 5 %) after one postoperative year.

30|$|The parietal {{peritoneum}} {{is opened}} above the iliac arteries. Smooth vascular clamps “De Bakey” are {{introduced into the}} abdominal cavity by “Endoclinch” forceps. The clamps are applied on the dissected arteries from both sides. The incision of the uterus wall above the myoma node is performed by ultrasonic scissors (Auto Sonix Covidien)or using monopolar coagulation. The myoma node is extracted from the surrounding tissue by two 10  mm forceps. We have never found wound bleeding, so we have excellent opportunity to visualize the border of node. We separate the node with minimal electrosurgical damage of myometrium, without the risk of uterine cavity opening. While the node is being pulled out, we introduce intravenous oxitocin; more contracting uterus “pushes” the node helping it to get out, the wound surface is decreasing. We suture the wound in several layers safe and careful under the conditions of good visualization. We use synthetic absorbable suture material for closing the wound. Convenient exposition is created by means of <b>uterus</b> manipulator. <b>Myoma</b> nodes are removed by morcellation. The uterus body is covered with antiadhesion barrier.

40|$|Chronic {{irritation}} on the urothelium, may it be inflammatory or mechanical, causes polypous or papillomatous {{proliferation of}} the epithelium. As mechanical one, urinary calculus {{plays an important}} role. This fact was proved in Japon by Tsuji et al. experimentally. Kato has found 4 cases of polypous proliferation out of 50 cases of renal stone (8 % incidence). Hino pointed out that inflammatory tumor of the ureter {{could be found in}} 6. 6 % of ureterolithotomized cases. In this paper, 5 cases of polypous vegetatio n of the renal pelvis or ureter growing around the calculus and one case of polyp in sigmoid colon arising from the ureterosigmoidostomized ureteral stump were presented. Case 1. 38 year-old, male. A stone of finger-tip s ize was found incarcerated in the intramuscular portion of the right ureter, accompanied by several rod-like vegetations growing at the tip of right ureteral orifice and hanging into the bladder (Fig. 1). The stone was removed and the polyps (rod-like vegetations) were resected (Fig. 2). Histology revealed the polyps to be of inflammatory granulomatous vegetations (Fig. 3). Case 2. 30 year-old, male. A stone of finger-tip size was situated at right ureteral end. On ureterogram, irregular shadow defect was found closely above the stone (Fig. 4). On operation several polypous or papillomatous growths, 1 - 2 mm x 5 - 6 mm in size, were found around the stone. Histology revealed them to be fibrous polyps containing many capillaries with stroma (Fig. 5). Ca s e 3. 37 year-old, male. A bean-sized stone w a s situated at lumbar part of the left ureter. On operation, several polypous vegetations were found about the stone which were removed together (Fig. 6). They were proved to be polyps histologically (Fig. 7). Case 4. 34 year-old, male. A thumb-tip-sized ren a l pelvic stone associated with some ricecorn-sized polypous vegetations was recognized on operation. Histology revealed them to be inflammatory granuloma (Fig. 8). Case 5. 46 y e a r-old, male. In this case, ureterogram showed irregullar shadow defects both above and under the stone (Fig. 9), which lie {{in the middle of the}} right ureter. Small polyps were resected. and stone removed by operation. Histology proved them to be granulomatous fibrous tissues (Fig. 10). Case 6. 4 4 year-old, female. Nine years ago, the p atient was hysterectomized because of <b>uterus</b> <b>myoma,</b> followed by right uretero-vaginal-fistula, which was treated by ureterosigmoidostomy. About 8 years after the operation, bloody discharge was noticed from her anus, and it continued for about a year. A malignant tumor of the sigmoid was suspected. On operation, a thumb-tip-sized papillomatous or polypous growth arising from the ureterosigmoidostomized ureteral stump was observed (Fig. 11, P). The tip of the growth was tricephalic. Histological findings showed it to be an old granulomatous vegetation covered with colonic epithelium (Fig. 12). On l y 11 cases of polypous vegetation of the renal pelvic and, ureteral epithelium, and 8 other cases associated with stones have been reported up to date in Japan.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Many {{patients}} with endometriosis {{are treated with}} medication or by surgical approaches. However, {{a small number of}} patients do not respond to medication and are inoperable because of comorbidities. This case report shows the effectiveness of radiotherapy for refractory endometriosis and includes a time series of serum estradiol levels. Case presentation A 47 -year-old Asian woman presented to our facility with uncontrolled endometriosis refractory to medication. Our patient was considered inoperable because of severe idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and underwent radiotherapy for massive genital bleeding requiring blood transfusions. A radiation dose of 20 Gy in 10 fractions was delivered to the pelvis, including the bilateral ovaries, <b>uterus,</b> and <b>myomas.</b> An additional 10 Gy in five fractions was delivered to the endometrium to control residual bleeding. Genital bleeding was completely inhibited on day 46 after radiotherapy. Hormonal analysis revealed that radiotherapy induced post-menopausal status. Two years after radiotherapy, atypical genital bleeding had not recurred and has been well controlled without side effects. Conclusions Disrupted ovarian function is an adverse effect of radiotherapy. However, radiotherapy can be useful for inducing menopause. In cases of medication-refractory or inoperable endometriosis, radiotherapy would be an effective treatment option. </p...|$|R

She was transferred to her personal suite after 4  h of postoperative observation. When examined half an hour later, she was found dead. The cause of death could not be ascertained because a postmortem examination was not permitted. There was no evidence to suggest intraperitoneal bleeding. The most likely cause of death in a young healthy patient with no preexisting morbid conditions is pulmonary thromboembolism.|$|R
40|$|Laparoscopic {{myomectomy}} {{offers a}} real benefit to infertile patients with uterine fibroids and peritoneal adhesions. The procedure requires a skilled surgeon and laparoscopy technique to minimize adhesion formation and other proven benefits. Restrictions arise since this procedure requires power morcellation for fibroid tissue extraction. Two years ago, the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America (FDA) issued the alert on power morcellation for uterine leiomyomas, addressing {{the risk of}} malignant cell spreading within the abdominal cavity (actual risk assessment from 1 in 360 to 1 in 7400 cases). We review a 30 -year-old female, without previous gestations, hypermenorrhea, intermenstrual bleeding, and chronic pelvic pain. Transvaginal ultrasound reports multiple fibroids in the right portion of a bicornuate uterus. Relevant history includes open myomectomy 6 years before and a complicated appendectomy, developing peritonitis within a year. Laparoscopy revealed multiple adhesions blocking uterine access, a bicornuate <b>uterus,</b> and <b>myomas</b> in the expected site. Myomectomy was performed utilizing power morcellation with good results. FDA recommendations have diminished this procedure’s selection, converting many to open variants. This particular case was technically challenging, requiring morcellation, and safety device deployment was impossible, yet the infertility issue was properly addressed.

40|$|Introduction : Torsion of {{the uterus}} is defined as a {{rotation}} of more than 45 ° around the long axis {{of the uterus}}; 2 / 3 of cases are dextrorotations. The extent of rotation usually ranges from 45 ° to 180 °. Objective: The purpose of the article was to present a case study of a postmenopausal woman with uterine torsion and myomas and to review the articles discussing the problem of rotated non-pregnant uterus. Material and methods : The article analyses {{the course of an}} extremely uncommon pathology, i. e. uterine torsion in a  67 -year-old patient. Laparotomy exposed the <b>uterus</b> with <b>myomas</b> and numerous hemorrhages, rotated by 180 ° to the right side, size of 350 × 300 × 200 mm and bilateral necrosis of the ovaries. Moreover, we present a review of articles discussing surgical management in case of rotated non-pregnant uterus. Results and discussion: The patient was operated on by a team of gynecologists and surgeons. The uterus was derotated and total hysterectomy with salpingoophorectomy was performed. A fragment of the hepatic oval ligament was excised and periumbilical hernioplasty was performed. The patient was released home on the 10 th day following the operation. Conclusions : If women complain of pain located within the small pelvis and abdominal cavity it is necessary to remember that it might result from the torsion of reproductive organs which is an uncommon condition but poses a health or life threat to patients. Surgical treatment of uterine torsion is successful if promptly implemented; in certain cases it is even possible to spare the patient’s fertility...|$|R
40|$|The {{past decades}} have brought about {{numerous}} new methods {{in the treatment}} of the most frequent benign gynaecological tumour, the myoma, while at the same time, the indications of traditional surgical treatment have also been reassessed. The constant procrastination of pregnancy to older and older age, the frequency of myoma growing by age and the wider application of assisted reproduction techniques have created new conditions for the treatment of myoma. In our research, we analysed the data of 30 infertile patients out of a group of 99 who had hysteroscopic and laparoscopic myomectomy carried out in one session. In the course of 2  years, nine women got pregnant. Besides two miscarriages, the others could carry their pregnancy for at least 34  weeks.

40|$|Abstract The main female {{anatomical}} {{causes of}} infertility include post-infectious tubal damage, endometriosis, and congenital/acquired uterine anomalies. Congenital (septate <b>uterus)</b> and acquired (<b>myomas</b> and synechiae) {{diseases of the}} uterus may lead to infertility, pregnancy loss, and other obstetric complications. Pelvic inflammatory disease represents {{the most common cause}} of tubal damage. Surgery still remains an important option for tubal factor infertility, with results in terms of reproductive outcome that compare favorably with those of in vitro fertilization. Endometriosis is a common gynecologic condition affecting women of reproductive age, which can cause pain and infertility. The cause of infertility associated with endometriosis remains elusive, suggesting a multifactorial mechanism involving immunologic, genetic, and environmental factors. Despite the high prevalence of endometriosis, the exact mechanisms of its pathogenesis are unknown. Specific combinations of medical, surgical, and psychological treatments can ameliorate the quality of life of women with endometriosis. In the majority of cases, surgical treatment of endometriosis has promoted significant increases in fertilization rates. There are obvious associations between endometriosis and the immune system, and future strategies to treat endometriosis might be based on immunologic concepts. © 2013 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Minimally {{invasive}} surgery {{has been the}} trend in various specialties and continues to evolve as new technology develops. The development of robotic surgery in gynecology remains in its infancy. The present study reports the first descriptive series of robotic surgery in complicated gynecologic diseases in Taiwan. Materials and Methods: From March 2009 to February 2011, the records of patients undergoing robotic surgery using the da Vinci Surgical System were reviewed for patient demographics, indications, operative time, hospital stay, conversion to laparotomy, and complications. Results: Sixty cases were reviewed in the present study. Forty-nine patients had benign gynecologic diseases, and 11 patients had malignancies. These robot-assisted laparoscopic procedures include nine hysterectomy, 15 subtotal hysterectomy, 13 myomectomy, eight staging operation, two radical hysterectomy, five ovarian cystectomy, one bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and myomectomy, two resections of deep pelvic endometriosis, one pelvic adhesiolysis, three sacrocolpopexy and one tuboplasty. Thirty-three patients had prior pelvic surgery, and one {{had a history of}} pelvic radiotherapy. Adhesiolysis was necessary in 38 patients to complete the whole operation. Robotic myomectomy was easily accomplished in patients with huge <b>uterus</b> or multiple <b>myomas.</b> The suturing of myometrium or cervical stump after ligation of the uterine arteries minimized the blood loss. In addition, it was much easier to dissect severe pelvic adhesions. The dissection of para-aortic lymph nodes can be easily accomplished. All these surgeries were performed smoothly without ureteral, bladder or bowel injury. Conclusion: The present analyses include various complicated gynecologic conditions, which make the estimation of the effectiveness of robotic surgery in each situation individually not appropriate. However, our experiences do show that robotic surgery is feasible and safe for patients with complicated gynecologic diseases...|$|R
