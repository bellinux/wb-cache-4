5|$|In 1960, the Canadian {{government}} {{protected the}} horses by law in their feral state. From the 1980s on, long-term, noninvasive herd {{studies have been}} performed, and in 2007 a genetic analysis was conducted that concluded the herd was genetically unique enough to interest conservationists. In 2008, the horses were declared the official horse of Nova Scotia, and in 2011, the island was declared the Sable Island National Park Reserve. The herd is <b>unmanaged,</b> and legally protected from interference by humans. The horses live only at Sable Island and at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park on the mainland of Nova Scotia, with the latter herd descended from horses removed from Sable Island in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{were first}} {{reported}} in the Kaimanawa Range in 1876, although the first horses had been brought into New Zealand in 1814. The feral herds grew as horses escaped and were released from sheep stations and cavalry bases. Members of the herd were recaptured by locals for use as riding horses, {{as well as being}} caught for their meat, hair and hides. The herd declined as large scale farming and forestry operations encroached on their ranges, and only around 174 horses were known to exist by 1979. The Kaimanawa herd was protected by the New Zealand government in 1981, and there were 1,576 horses in the herd by 1994. A small, mostly <b>unmanaged</b> population also exists on the Aupouri Peninsula at the northern tip of the North Island. Roundups have been carried out annually since 1993 to manage the size of the herd, removing around 2,800 horses altogether. The Kaimanawa population is listed as a herd of special genetic value by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization, and several studies have been conducted on the herd dynamics and habits of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Pressure {{from land}} {{development}} and an encroaching human population reduced {{the range and}} the number of the Kaimanawa horses, and in 1979 it was found that only about 174 horses remained. Starting in 1981, the Kaimanawa population, range size, and herd movements began to be officially measured, and a protected area was formed for the breed in the Waiouru Military Training Area. Legislative protection was similar to the kiwi and other native species. There was a rapid increase in the herd size following the protection of the breed, and 1,576 horses were known to exist in the area by 1994. There is also a small population of horses on the Aupouri Peninsula at the northern tip of the North Island, which is mostly <b>unmanaged</b> by the New Zealand government. In 2008, the Kaimanawa herds were the focus of a novel called Kaimanawa Princess, by Dianne Haworth.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the smalltail shark {{is caught}} {{incidentally}} by gillnet and longline fisheries throughout its range. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted. In addition, the dried fins are exported {{for use in}} shark fin soup, the liver oil and cartilage are used medicinally, and the carcass is processed into fishmeal. In 2006, the IUCN assessed this species, including Pacific populations now separated as C. cerdale, as Data Deficient {{due to a lack}} of fishery data. In Trinidad, its abundance makes it the most economically important shark. Off northern Brazil, substantial numbers are caught by gillnet fisheries targeting the Serra Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus brasiliensis). In the 1980s, this species constituted roughly 43% of the shark and ray catch, but has since declined to around 17%. This apparent decline is thought to have resulted from increasing fishing effort, the large proportion of juveniles captured, and the shark's low reproductive rate. Consequently, the IUCN has assessed the smalltail shark in Brazil as Vulnerable, and noted the urgent need for conservation measures given that northern Brazil represents the center of the species' range. Although the smalltail shark was ostensibly given protection by inclusion on the 2004 Official List of Endangered Animals in Brazil, fishing remains effectively <b>unmanaged.</b>|$|E

25|$|It is {{the common}} {{understanding}} of natural environment that underlies environmentalism — a broad political, social, and philosophical movement that advocates various actions and policies {{in the interest of}} protecting what nature remains in the natural environment, or restoring or expanding the role of nature in this environment.

25|$|The subregion's nature {{reserves}} are poorly managed. Little {{information is available}} for management purposes, as the subregion {{has not had a}} thorough biodiversity survey, vegetation mapping is available only at 1:250,000 scale, and there are virtually no historical records of fires or other significant events. Other than routine baiting of foxes in some reserves, there is little done to manage threats. The main threat, rising salinity, is completely <b>unmanaged,</b> despite having already caused widespread population declines and extinctions in lowland communities.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the merger}} of the three old municipalities, Shaghur's economy is not {{improving}} as expected and the city still remains quite poor and <b>unmanaged</b> due to political boycotts. According to the CBS, in 2004, there were 6,674 salaried workers. The mean monthly salary was 3,663 NIS The city's {{average income per capita}} decreased by −1.04 NIS to 1,093 NIS ranking it Israel's 19th poorest municipality. The amount of employed persons in the city that received above twice the average wage was 1.45% in 2003. Its population density is also increasing because of the city's inability to expand residentially and commercially beyond its jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|At that time, XBMC {{spin-offs}} were {{abundant and}} {{were created by}} developers to solve a specific problem. In this situation, the reason was because XBMC was not available for Mac OS X yet. Fervent user of managed programming languages like Java and C#, and after some debate with a coworker with regard to managed languages vs <b>unmanaged</b> ones like C++, Feingold decided to port a massive C++ project as a challenge. He downloaded the XBMC code, a project written in C++, and attempted to build it on the Mac {{for the first time}} in December 2007. This started the port to the Mac OS X platform.|$|E
500|$|The Kakapo Recovery {{programme}} {{has been}} successful, {{with the numbers}} of kakapo increasing steadily. Adult survival rate and productivity have both improved significantly since the programme's inception. However, the main goal is to establish at least one viable, self-sustaining, <b>unmanaged</b> population of kakapo as a functional component of the ecosystem in a protected habitat. To help meet this conservation challenge, two large Fiordland islands, Resolution (20,860ha) and Secretary (8,140ha), have been prepared for re-introduction of the kakapo with large-scale ecological restoration activities. Ultimately, the Kakapo Recovery vision for the species is to restore the [...] "mauri" [...] (Maori for [...] "life-force") of the kakapo by breeding 150 adult females.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) {{listed the}} night shark as a [...] "Species of Concern", {{meaning that it}} merits {{conservation}} concern but there is insufficient evidence for listing on the Endangered Species Act (ESA). In 1999, the NMFS Fishery Management Plan (FMP) of the Atlantic tunas, swordfish, and sharks was revised to prohibit the retention of 19 species, including the night shark. The prohibition of this species was upheld by Amendment 1 of the FMP, added in 2003. Night sharks suffer high bycatch mortality on longlines, and prohibited or not some are kept by fishers because of their value {{and the difficulty of}} identifying disembodied parts to species. Nevertheless, a 20032008 NMFS population assessment concluded that night shark population in United States waters has stabilized (perhaps even increasing) and no longer merits categorization as a [...] "Species of Concern", though recommended that the prohibition on retention be maintained as a precautionary measure. This species should also benefit from the imposition of time/area closures in the Florida Straits and on the Charleston Bump. Off Brazil and elsewhere, fishing continues largely <b>unmanaged.</b> IUCN members have urged that Brazil improve catch monitoring and enforcement of existing regulations, declare some critical habitat off-limits, and implement the Brazilian National Plan of Action for Sharks (NPOA-Sharks) under the FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA-Sharks).|$|E

2500|$|Visual Studio allows {{developers}} to write extensions for Visual Studio {{to extend its}} capabilities. These extensions [...] "plug into" [...] Visual Studio and extend its functionality. Extensions {{come in the form}} of macros, add-ins, and packages. Macros represent repeatable tasks and actions that developers can record programmatically for saving, replaying, and distributing. Macros, however, cannot implement new commands or create tool windows. They are written using Visual Basic and are not compiled. Add-Ins provide access to the Visual Studio object model and can interact with the IDE tools. Add-Ins can be used to implement new functionality and can add new tool windows. Add-Ins are plugged into the IDE via COM and can be created in any COM-compliant languages. Packages are created using the Visual Studio SDK and provide the highest level of extensibility. They can create designers and other tools, as well as integrate other programming languages. The Visual Studio SDK provides <b>unmanaged</b> APIs as well as a managed API to accomplish these tasks. However, the managed API isn't as comprehensive as the <b>unmanaged</b> one. Extensions are supported in the Standard (and higher) versions of Visual Studio 2005. Express Editions do not support hosting extensions.|$|E

2500|$|Agroforestry {{provides}} {{many examples}} of reconciliation ecology at work. In tropical agroforestry systems, crops such as coffee or fruit trees are cultivated under a canopy of shade trees, providing habitat for tropical forest species outside of protected areas. For example, shade-grown coffee plantations typically have lower tree diversity than <b>unmanaged</b> forests, however they have much higher tree species diversity and richness than other agricultural methods. Agriculture that mimics nature, encourages natural forest species along with the crops, and also takes pressure off nearby uncultivated forest areas where people are allowed to collect forest products. [...] The understory can also be managed with reconciliation ecology: allowing weeds to grow among crops (minimizing labor and preventing the invasion of noxious weed species) and leaving fallowlands alongside farmed areas can enhance understory plant richness with associated benefits for native insects and birds compared to other agricultural practices.|$|E

The National Park Service concluded that two years after draining the valley, grasses would cover most of its floor and within 10 years, clumps of cone-bearing trees and some oaks would take root. Within 50 years, vegetative cover would be complete except for exposed rocky areas. In this <b>unmanaged</b> scenario, where nature is left to take hold in the valley, eventually a forest would grow, rather than the meadow being restored. However, the same NPS study also finds that with intensive management, an outcome in which [...] "the entire valley would appear much as it did before construction of the reservoir" [...] is feasible.|$|E
