Carbon, in black powder, is a constituent of fireworks rocket propellants, bursting charges, and effects mixtures, and military delay fuses and igniters. Aluminium {{is a common}} pyrotechnic ingredient, and is widely employed for its capacity to generate light and heat, including in thermite mixtures. Phosphorus {{can be found in}} smoke and incendiary munitions, paper caps used in toy guns, and party poppers. Selenium has been <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as tellurium.|$|E
5|$|As {{characters}} gain experience points their mutant superpowers {{and unique}} abilities can be upgraded. Items found during gameplay {{can also be}} equipped to further enhance a character's abilities. Characters can combine attacks to create a combo, in which two or more players punch or kick a single enemy at the same time. The character's special abilities can also be <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> manner to create a Super Combo which inflicts massive damage on enemies. Each character has several mutant powers that players can assign to controller buttons. The game also features a skirmish mode, which allows players to fight against each other or waves of computer-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|Just as the Eiffel Tower {{is often}} used in popular culture to {{immediately}} locate a scene in Paris, France, the Tokyo Tower is often <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way for Tokyo. It is used in anime and manga such as Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Magic Knight Rayearth, Please Save My Earth, Cardcaptor Sakura, Digimon, Detective Conan, Sailor Moon, and Death Note. The tower is also frequently used in the Japanese kaiju (giant monster) film genre. It has been {{the location of the}} climactic 'battles' between Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and King Kong (King Kong Escapes) wherein it is frequently destroyed and rebuilt. Based on the popular manga series by Ryōhei Saigan, the 2005 film Always Sanchōme no Yūhi was a nostalgic view of life in the neighbourhoods under the construction of the Tokyo Tower.|$|E

5|$|National anthems {{are usually}} {{written in the}} most common {{language}} of the state, whether de facto or official. States with multiple national languages may offer several versions of their anthem. For instance, Switzerland's national anthem has different lyrics {{for each of the}} country's four official languages: French, German, Italian, and Romansh. The New Zealand national anthem is commonly now sung with the first verse in Māori ("Aotearoa") and the second in English ("God Defend New Zealand"). The tune is the same but the lyrics have different meanings. South Africa's national anthem is unique in that five of the eleven official languages are <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> anthem, in which each language comprises a stanza.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{north of}} the I-495 interchange, the {{northbound}} off-ramp and southbound on-ramp at NY25A split, then run under a pedestrian bridge that connects 46th Avenue. Other pedestrian bridges cross over the highway near 42nd Avenue and at 33rd Avenue. The northbound exit 5 uses 206th Street as a de facto service road, while 207th Street is <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way for the northbound on-ramps. Real service roads run beneath the Port Washington Branch of the Long Island Rail Road to connect NY25A and 35th Avenue (exit6A). The service roads merge into the expressway north of 26th Avenue (exit6B).|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Australian Army {{moved away}} from the machine gun {{battalion}} concept and no similar units were raised. The machine gun role was subsumed into the support companies of individual infantry battalions. The idea was arguably misunderstood by Australian commanders throughout the war and this may have influenced the decision {{to move away from the}} concept. When the units had been established, the intent had been for machine gun battalions to provide highly mobile fire support but this only worked where the principles of open warfare worked. Once the focus of Australian Army combat operations shifted to the Pacific, the machine gun battalions were largely misused, being employed in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets or for menial tasks, rather than as offensive weapons for long range fire support. The medium machine guns were also largely <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> manner as light machine guns, such as the Bren. Other reasons identified for the concept's limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders, a preference for organic fire support over attached sub-units, over-estimating the difficulty of transporting Vickers guns in the jungle and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen. The difficulties of target acquisition in dense jungle also contributed.|$|E

5|$|Scholars of Old Norse mythology now {{focus on}} {{references}} to elves in Old Norse poetry, particularly the Elder Edda. The only character explicitly {{identified as an}} elf in classical Eddaic poetry, if any, is Völundr, the protagonist of Völundarkviða. However, elves are frequently mentioned in the alliterating phrase Æsir ok Álfar ('Æsir and elves') and its variants. This was clearly a well established poetic formula, indicating a strong tradition of associating elves with the group of gods known as the Æsir, or even suggesting that the elves and Æsir were one and the same. The pairing is paralleled in the Old English poem Wið færstice and in the Germanic personal name system; moreover, in Skaldic verse the word elf is <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as words for gods. Sigvatr Þórðarson’s skaldic travelogue Austrfaravísur, composed around 1020, mentions an álfablót (‘elves' sacrifice’) in Edskogen {{in what is now}} southern Sweden. There {{does not seem to have}} been any clear-cut distinction between humans and gods; like the Æsir, then, elves were presumably thought of as being human(-like) and existing in opposition to the giants. Many commentators have also (or instead) argued for conceptual overlap between elves and dwarves in Old Norse mythology, which may fit with trends in the medieval German evidence.|$|E
