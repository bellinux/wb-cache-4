5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. In {{the background of the}} classroom, there are several portraits of past United States presidents.

The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image for free. Howe, their second choice, was suggested by Al Jean, who had been a Detroit Red Wings fan growing <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the episode, Howe's NHL and WHA statistics are shown because the writers decided to try something different in filling a slight time under-run.|$|E

The story was divided into four parts, but after reaching the third part changes had to be made at the storyboard phase in order to not exceed the decided running time.

5|$|Early {{on during}} the 2010–11 season, Evra was {{hampered}} by constant inquiries about {{what happened at the}} 2010 FIFA World Cup from the French Football Federation (FFF), the French media, as well as the French government.
