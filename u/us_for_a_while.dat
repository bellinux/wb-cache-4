60|$|There {{was silence}} between <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> It was {{possible}} for me to think.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well, in New England, and in {{the free}} States, you have the better of us, I grant. But there's the bell; so, Cousin, let <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> lay aside our {{sectional}} prejudices, and come out to dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{you leave}} <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> Reuben? We will examine these lists {{that you have}} made, and reckon up the total cost; and we shall then see the better how much we shall each have to contribute, to make up our venture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother," [...] he said, with {{something}} {{of his old}} strength of voice, [...] "leave <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short <b>while.</b> This woman has somewhat to tell me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{all love}} is needless," [...] she said, [...] "we {{could do better}} without it, choose with more discretion. If it is only {{something}} that worries <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> and then passes, what {{is the sense of}} it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{you boys}} have rather {{got the best}} of <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while,</b> so I'll give in with as good a grace as I can. I've come to hire you; get your trunk aboard right away. I want to leave at twelve o'clock.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What can we do?" [...] {{answered}} Hayraddin, gloomily. [...] "These men {{deal with}} us as the sheepdogs do with the flock, they protect <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> drive us hither and thither at their pleasure, and always end by guiding us to the shambles." ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR LAD,--That is all right, {{and a good}} job. About coming down, you cannot {{get into}} <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> as you may imagine; we are in desperate vortex, and {{everybody}} 'most dead. I have been two days in bed with liver and slight bleeding.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{could not}} help doing that," [...] argued Coralie, [...] "and it is their misfortune that they are here on Sky Island at all. Perhaps if we keep them with <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> they may {{find a way to}} return safely to their own country." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 3 - Scott Hain, 32, {{last person}} to be {{executed}} in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> crime committed <b>while</b> still <b>a</b> juvenile.|$|R
50|$|The <b>U.S.</b> (and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> the world) {{altitude}} {{record for}} unmanned balloons was 51.8 km (according to a 1991 edition of Guinness Book of World Records). The vehicle was a Winzen-Balloon with {{a volume of}} 1.35 million cubic metres, which was launched during October 1972 in Chico, California, USA.|$|R
6000|$|He did succeed, however, {{and as he}} {{carefully}} replaced it in the bag {{he said to the}} monkey: [...] "There's seven dollars an' thirty cents in that bag, an' every cent of it is mine. That ought to take care of <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good <b>while,</b> Mr. Stubbs; an' {{by the time we get}} home we shall be rich men." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was silence}} between <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> then, quietly raising herself, {{she looked down}} at me on the pillow, and, finding me to be still awake, a long smile spread over her face: [...] "Why, we don't seem neither of us to be much good at daytime sleeping." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother," [...] said Constance, [...] "I think I {{can guess}} her motives, which make it painful {{for her to}} show the letter, and will explain what I think they are. Fan, dear, will you leave <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> {{and let me tell}} mother why Miss Starbrow will not take you back?" ...|$|E
60|$|That was {{something}} to my taste. I have seen a few grizzlies. Riding to higher ground I kept close watch on the few open patches up on the slope. The chase led toward <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Suddenly I saw a big bear with a frosted coat go lumbering across one of these openings.|$|E
50|$|Also in 2003, Del Naja {{was arrested}} on child porn allegations, which were {{reported}} widely in the media. Del Naja was soon eliminated as a suspect (although {{he was charged with}} ecstasy possession and unable to get <b>a</b> <b>US</b> visa <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while)</b> with Daddy G and fans proffering their support. The arrest affected the beginning of the 100th Window tour schedule.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Too true, Percy,' Mr. Hardy {{said with}} a sigh, after a short silence; 'it is {{altogether}} impossible, and I should call it a clumsy artifice, were it not that it deceived <b>us</b> all <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> However, there is one comfort; it decides the question as we had ourselves decided it: Ethel is gone with the larger party to the south.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{turned my}} head aside, <b>for,</b> with <b>a</b> rush and a sweep, like the old marsh winds {{coming up from the}} sea, a feeling like that which had subdued me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were solemnly rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post, smote upon my heart again. There was silence between <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{mother looked}} at <b>us.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> the proud, {{sensitive}} woman struggled successfully with herself; but the pang that wrung her {{was not to}} be endured in silence. With a low cry of pain, she hid her face in her hands. Overwhelmed by the sense of her own degradation, she was even ashamed to let the man who loved her see that she was in tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jerome Parker, {{you are a}} donkey," [...] remarked Elsie, calmly. [...] "Nothing {{has really}} happened. If you're so nervous, go home. You can't sculp an Indian, anyway--grasshoppers and sheep are in your line." [...] She had reverted to the plain talk of the studios. [...] "Your {{nervousness}} amused <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> but it bores us now. Please shut up and run away if you are afraid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{like the}} look of it, boys, at all. We ought, {{according}} to published accounts, {{to be able to}} put a larger army than theirs in the field, just at first and, if we were but prepared, should certainly be able to carry all before <b>us,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> I question very much if we are so prepared. Supposing it to be so, however, the success would, I fear, be but temporary; for the German reserves are greatly superior to ours. Discipline, too, has gone off sadly, since I first knew the French army.|$|E
6000|$|The ceremonies {{were over}} and the priests, with the {{exception}} of Harût and two who remained to attend upon him, vanished, probably to inform the male and female hierophants of their result, and through these the whole people of the White Kendah. Old Harût stared at <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while,</b> then said in English, which he always liked to talk when Ragnall was present, perhaps for the sake of practice: ...|$|R
2500|$|The phrase [...] "our first Black president" [...] {{was adopted}} as a {{positive}} by Bill Clinton supporters. When the Congressional Black Caucus honored the former president at its dinner in Washington D.C. on September 29, 2001, for instance, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX), the chair, told the audience that Clinton [...] "took so many initiatives he made <b>us</b> think <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> we had elected the first black president." ...|$|R
6000|$|... {106}[133] ["Whenever a heavy shower afforded {{us a few}} mouthfuls {{of fresh}} water, either by {{catching}} the drops as they fell or by squeezing them out of our clothes, it infused new life and vigour into <b>us,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> we had almost forgot our misery."--Shipwrecks and Disasters at Sea, 1812, iii. 270. Compare The Island, Canto I. stanza ix. lines 193, 194, Poetical Works, 1901, v. 595.] ...|$|R
60|$|The {{farthest}} {{of these}} Virgin Islands is St. Thomas's. And there ended {{the first and}} longer part of a voyage unmarred by the least discomfort, discourtesy, or dulness, and full of enjoyment, for which thanks are due alike to captain, officers, crew, and passengers, and also to our much-maligned friend the North-East wind, who caught us up in the chops of the Channel, helped us graciously on nearly to the tropic of Cancer, giving us a more prosperous passage than the oldest hands recollect at this season, and then left <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to the delicious calms of {{the edge of the}} tropic, to catch us up again as the North-East Trade.|$|E
60|$|To {{describe}} the comprehensive grandeur of that view is beyond my powers. There was something so inexpressibly solemn and overpowering about those huge volcanoes--for doubtless they are extinct volcanoes--that it quite awed <b>us.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> the morning lights played upon {{the snow and}} the brown and swelling masses beneath, and then, as though to veil the majestic sight from our curious eyes, strange vapours and clouds gathered and increased around the mountains, till presently we could only trace their pure and gigantic outlines, showing ghostlike through the fleecy envelope. Indeed, as we afterwards discovered, usually they were wrapped in this gauze-like mist, which doubtless accounted for our not having seen them more clearly before.|$|E
6000|$|So {{those of}} the court spake together, and Sir Ewaine was aware that they {{regarded}} him with disfavor and he was hurt to the quick by that knowledge. So one day he came to King Arthur where he was, and he said: [...] "Lord, I am aware that I am held in disrepute in this court. Now I crave thy leave to depart from hence {{at least for a}} season." [...] And King Arthur said: [...] "Messire, I will not deny that many things displeasing to me are said concerning thee. So if it be that thou art of a mind to quit <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> until thou art able to approve thy truth and thy honor, and until thou hast disproved these things which thy calumniators say against thee, thou hast my fair leave to depart according to thy request." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare not}} deny {{that you will be}} better away from <b>us,</b> but only <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Forgive me, dearest; I cannot find the courage to say good-bye." [...] Those few words spoke for him--and no more.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, {{he signed}} the German {{nationality}} list (Volksliste) and in 1942 was drafted into the Wehrmacht. In 1944 he was captured by the <b>U.S.</b> Army and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> was kept at a POW camp in Austria.|$|R
5000|$|Lisa Babick from TV Fanatic, gave {{a perfect}} 5 star rating out of 5, stating: [...] "Gotham strung <b>us</b> along <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> {{before we got}} to see what we've been so patiently waiting for, but it was well worth the wait." [...] Vinnie Mancuso of New York Observer wrote, [...] "'Smile Like You Mean It' {{in honor of the}} recent Presidential Inauguration, was {{completely}} stolen by David Mazouz, Camren Bicondova and returning guest star Cameron Monaghan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my people," [...] cried Bes, [...] "it is I, Karoon, who {{having been}} {{miraculously}} preserved from many dangers in far lands by {{the help of}} the Grasshopper in heaven, and, as my messengers will have told you, of my beloved friend, lord Shabaka the Egyptian, who has deigned to come to dwell with <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> have at length returned to Ethiopia that I may shed my wisdom on you like the sun and pour it on your heads like melted honey. Moreover, mindful of our laws which aforetime I defied and therefore left you, I have searched the whole world through till I found the most beautiful woman that it contained, and made her my wife. She too has deigned to come to this far country to be your queen. Advance, fair Karema, and show yourself to these my Ethiopians." ...|$|E
60|$|Lamed by his fall, and {{obliged to}} remain much within doors, where certain society {{did not always}} amuse him, James Binnie sought {{excitement}} in {{the pleasures of the}} table, partaking of them the more freely now that his health could afford them the less. Clive, the sly rogue, observed a great improvement in the commissariat since his good father's time, ate his dinner with thankfulness, and made no remarks. Nor did he confide to <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> his opinion that Mrs. Mack bored the good gentleman most severely; that he pined away under her kindnesses; sneaked off to bis study-chair and his nap; was only too glad when some of the widow's friends came, or she went out; seeming to breathe more freely when she was gone, and drink his wine more cheerily when rid of the intolerable weight of her presence.|$|E
6000|$|To leave <b>us</b> (<b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while),</b> {{after what}} had happened, {{might be the}} wisest thing which a man, in Philip's {{critical}} position, could do. But if I went with him--unprovided as I was with any friend of my own sex, whose character and presence might sanction the step I had taken--I should be lost beyond redemption. Is any man that ever lived worth that sacrifice? I thought of my father's house closed to me, and of our friends ashamed of me. I have owned, in some earlier part of my Journal, that I am not very patient under domestic cares. But the possibility of Eunice being appointed housekeeper, with my power, in my place, was more than I could calmly contemplate. [...] "No," [...] I said to Philip. [...] "Your absence, {{at such a time}} as this, may help us both; but, come what may of it, I must remain at home." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} I {{recall that}} clean-shaven man who talked with <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> {{in the public}} office at Wassen, the man who {{reminded me of my}} boyish conception of a Knight Templar, and with him come momentary impressions of other lithe and serious-looking people dressed after the same manner, words and phrases we have read in such scraps of Utopian reading as have come our way, and expressions that fell from the loose mouth of the man with the blond hair....|$|R
6000|$|... "Bell, my dear," [...] said he, [...] "I want {{to speak}} to your mother <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute or two on a matter of business. You wouldn't mind leaving <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while,</b> would you?" [...] Whereupon Bell {{collected}} up her work and went upstairs to her sister. [...] "Uncle Christopher is below with mamma," [...] said she, [...] "talking about business. I suppose it is something to do with your marriage." [...] But Bell was wrong. The squire's visit had no reference to Lily's marriage.|$|R
6000|$|Harvey Moran gave a great sigh {{of relief}} and wiped his forehead. [...] "Well, anyway," [...] he said, [...] "it's cheap at the price just {{to find out that}} it wasn't a system." [...] His face began to work, and then he broke into {{laughter}} and slapped Smoke on the shoulder. [...] "Smoke, you had <b>us</b> going <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and we patting ourselves on the back because you were letting our tables alone! Say, I've got some real fizz I'll open if you'll all come over to the Tivoli with me." ...|$|R
