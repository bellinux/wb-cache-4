5|$|<b>Unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 13th-century Gothic cathedral, most of {{the windows}} are of clear glass.|$|E
5|$|The {{circle is}} located {{at the bottom of a}} narrow valley. Though this is <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{monument}} of this type, the Dorset Rempstone stone circle was also erected within a valley.|$|E
5|$|It {{has some}} {{properties}} that are <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> metal; taken together, these are sometimes {{used as a}} basis to classify aluminium as a metalloid. Its crystalline structure shows some evidence of directional bonding. Aluminium bonds covalently in most compounds. The oxide Al2O3 is amphoteric, and a conditional glass-former. Aluminium can form anionic aluminates, such behaviour being considered nonmetallic in character.|$|E
25|$|Brooklyn Tech uses a college-style {{system of}} majors, <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> American high school.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} items that are either unique to Hatzalah, or that are {{relatively}} <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> EMS include: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{behaviour}} of this {{stick insect}} is highly <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> insect species, {{in that the}} males and females form a bond.|$|R
5|$|Many {{different}} mammalian {{species can}} be affected by prion diseases, as the prion protein (PrP) is very similar in all mammals. Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> prion disease to transmit from one species to another. The human prion disease variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, however, {{is believed to be}} caused by a prion that typically infects cattle, causing Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and is transmitted through infected meat.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{television}} series, {{the sound}} team receives {{a rough cut}} of a full season and approaches it as a ten-hour feature film. Although seasons one and two had different sound teams, one team has {{been in charge of}} sound since then. For the show's blood-and-gore sounds, the team often uses a chamois. For dragon screams, mating tortoises and dolphin, seal, lion and bird sounds have been used.|$|E
5|$|In each {{of these}} assignments, Hotze proved himself as a {{confident}} and courageous general against the stronger French Army of the Moselle. In recognition, {{he was promoted to}} Feldmarschall-leutnant, a rank <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> man from a non-aristocratic family. He was also raised to the rank of baron (Freiherr) by Emperor Francis II. In the campaign of 1795, he served again under the command of Wurmser; his troops secured Rhineland positions near Mannheim, and later took part in engagements at Edighofen and Kaiserslautern.|$|E
50|$|In addition, Tiwi has a velar approximant, {{which is}} {{somewhat}} <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Australian language. Typically <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Australian language, {{there are no}} fricatives.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> opera, all {{the vocal}} parts are spoken, but unlike a play, {{the music is}} {{continuous}} and relates strongly to the text.|$|R
50|$|Deseret News {{gave the}} ColecoVision version of Keystone Kapers 3 stars. It praised the game's {{graphical}} {{improvement over the}} original, <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Activision port.|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers began finding {{other objects}} {{at least as}} far away as Pluto, now known as Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs. Many of these shared some of Pluto's key orbital {{characteristics}} and are now called plutinos. Pluto came to be seen as the largest member of a new class of objects, and some astronomers stopped referring to Pluto as a planet. Pluto's eccentric and inclined orbit, while very <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> planet in the Solar System, fits in well with the other KBOs. New York City's newly renovated Hayden Planetarium did not include Pluto in its exhibit of the planets when it reopened as the Rose Center for Earth and Space in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Erie had a {{significant}} Russian immigrant community, many members of which worked in the shipbuilding plants along the bayfront. <b>Unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Great Lakes city, {{a substantial number of}} these Russian immigrants were priestless (Bespopovtsy) Old Believers. In 1983, most of this community united with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and became an Old Ritualist priest within the canonical Orthodox Church. Even today, the gold-domed Church of the Nativity, on the bayfront near the former heart of the Russian community, is an Old Ritualist church and home parish to the famed iconographer Fr. Theodore Jurewicz.|$|E
5|$|No {{definite}} conclusion as to {{the date}} of Nikephoros' death can be reached today, but most modern scholars, such as Jean-Claude Cheynet, are doubtful of the version of Theophanes Continuatus. It {{would have been very}} <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> former Domestic to be appointed to the subordinate position of a thematic strategos, and there is reason to doubt the authenticity of the tale of Zaoutzes' seeing in Nikephoros a potential future emperor and offering the hand of an—otherwise unknown—daughter in marriage.|$|E
50|$|Warragamba is <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Australian town, as {{the streets}} {{do not have}} typical names, but are {{numbered}} (such as First Street and Eighteenth Street).|$|R
50|$|<b>Unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{official}} of his rank, Yang {{has never been}} a full nor alternate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.|$|R
5000|$|The Onondaga County Sheriff's Office history (<b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{organization}} [...] "proudly serving since 1794") traces {{its history}} back to 450-650 AD, when Saxon sheriffs ruled in England.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the things}} that Spector wanted to achieve in Deus Ex was to make JC Denton a cipher for the player, {{in order to create a}} better {{immersion}} and gameplay experience. He did not want the character to force any emotion so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing comes from themselves rather than from JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor Jay Anthony Franke to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a monotone voice, which is <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> voice acting role.|$|E
5|$|Part {{of the new}} {{genre of}} the Romantic travel narrative, History of a Six Weeks' Tour exudes spontaneity and enthusiasm; the authors {{demonstrate}} their desire to {{develop a sense of}} taste and distinguish themselves from those around them. The romantic elements of the work would have hinted at the text's radical politics to nineteenth-century readers. However, the text's frank discussion of politics, including positive references to the French Revolution and praise of Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> travel narrative at the time, particularly one authored primarily by a woman.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{concerns}} over security led to Henry II investing heavily {{in a new}} castle structure on the site between 1171 and 1174. It was <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new royal castle {{to be built in}} this part of England during the 12th century, and Henry appears to have been driven by the military threat from Scotland before and during the Great Revolt of 1173 to 1174. Henry II spent almost £600 on the castle between 1170 and 1187, most of it in the first few years, rebuilding the older structure {{under the supervision of the}} Count of Brittany's local tenants, Torfin, Osbert and Stephen of Barningham.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{title of the}} song was [...] "Honey Pie". [...] "Waterloo" [...] was originally written with simultaneous rock music and jazz beats (<b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ABBA song).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> active-duty officer, McMaster scolded the U.S. {{government}} for its [...] "arrogance, weakness, lying {{in pursuit of}} self-interest and abdication of responsibility to the American people." ...|$|R
50|$|This tour {{established}} Carey's concert-going {{fan base}} in Japan; {{all of her}} subsequent tours would also visit that country except for the Angel Advocates tour, <b>a</b> regularity <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> American artist.|$|R
5|$|Solid xenon {{changes from}} face-centered cubic (fcc) to {{hexagonal}} close packed (hcp) crystal phase under pressure and begins to turn metallic at about 140GPa, with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase. It is completely metallic at 155GPa. When metallized, xenon appears sky blue because it absorbs red light and transmits other visible frequencies. Such behavior is <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> metal and is explained by the relatively small width of the electron bands in that state.|$|E
5|$|The mane of {{the adult}} male lion, unique among cats, {{is one of the}} most {{distinctive}} characteristics of the species. Although having a ruff is not so <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lioness, in rare cases, a female lion can have a mane. The presence, absence, colour, and size of the mane is associated with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate, and testosterone production; the rule of thumb is the darker and fuller the mane, the healthier the lion. Sexual selection of mates by lionesses favours males with the densest, darkest mane. Research in Tanzania also suggests mane length signals fighting success in male–male relationships. Darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 7–9 by 7–9µm, spherical {{or nearly}} so, ornamented with a partial to {{complete}} reticulum (a system of raised, net-like ridges), with prominences up to 0.5µm high. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are both two- and four-spored, and measure 45–52 by 9–11µm. The cap cuticle is a poorly formed layer of inflated cells with scattered filamentous pileocystidia (cystidia on the cap). Somewhat <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Lactarius, L.rufulus lacks or has few swollen cells (sphaerocysts) in {{the cap and}} stem.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] exclaimed Pigeonswing, in a {{way that}} was very <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Indian to {{interrupt}} another when speaking; [...] "want to ask question-- how many pale-face you t'ink is dere? Ebber count him?" ...|$|R
25|$|It is <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> apparitional {{figure to}} engage in any verbal {{interaction}} with the percipient; {{this is consistent with}} the finding that the majority of such experiences only involve one sense (most commonly the visual).|$|R
50|$|The tree {{has been}} {{described}} as possibly having triploid chromosome levels (<b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> American Elm), suggesting it may be a hybrid between the tetraploid and rarer diploid forms of American Elm, like the cultivar 'Jefferson'.|$|R
5|$|They {{were created}} either as pendants, that is {{conceived}} as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation {{may have been a}} later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{structure}} of the Earthsea novels is in many ways typical of fantasy, it has been described as subverting the tropes of this genre. The protagonists of her stories, with the exception of Tenar, were all dark-skinned, in comparison to the white-skinned heroes more traditionally used. The Tombs of Atuan examines the development of a young girl in great detail, a choice <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fantasy writer of the period in which the book was written.|$|E
5|$|When Zong sailed from Accra with 442slaves on 18August 1781, it {{had taken}} on {{more than twice the}} number of people that it could safely transport. In the 1780s, British-built ships {{typically}} carried 1.75slaves per ton of the ship's capacity; on the Zong, the ratio was 4.0 per ton. A British slave ship of the period would carry around 193slaves and it was extremely <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ship of Zong relatively small size to carry so many.|$|E
50|$|Tetramethylurea is a clear, colorless liquid {{with mild}} {{aromatic}} odor that is miscible {{with water and}} many organic solvents. <b>Unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> urea is the liquid state of tetramethylurea {{in a range of}} > 170 °C.|$|R
5000|$|It is <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> apparitional {{figure to}} engage in any verbal {{interaction}} with the percipient; {{this is consistent with}} the finding that the majority of such experiences only involve one sense (most commonly the visual).|$|R
50|$|There are {{currently}} about 10,000 registered players of TriadCity. Players are evenly divided {{between women and}} men, <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> online role-playing environment. Although {{the game is played}} in English, a high proportion of participants are from Europe.|$|R
