His book, Preston Sturges by Preston Sturges: His Life in His Words, was published in 1990 by Simon & Schuster. In 1975, he became the first writer to be given the Screen Writers Guild's Laurel Award posthumously. He has a star dedicated to him on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 1601 Vine Street.|$|E

500|$|During a later interview, Kelly Johnson {{was asked}} about his opinion on the aircraft, [...] "Did it come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> designs? In terms of performance, yes. In terms of engine, {{we went through a}} great many engine problems, not with the J65s but with the J79s." [...] For his part in {{designing}} the F-104 airframe, Johnson was jointly awarded the Collier Trophy in 1958, sharing the honor with General Electric (engine) and the U.S. Air Force (Flight Records).|$|E
500|$|While {{visiting a}} family member in Louisiana around 1870, Washington {{attended}} a Catholic mission organized by the Paulists at a neighboring parish. After [...] "careful study", Washington was received into the Roman Catholic Church. Prior to her conversion, Washington consulted with a clergyman at her Episcopal church, {{and in response to}} his concern, she replied: [...] "Oh no, I must act <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> convictions and I shall pray hard that you may be given the same grace." [...] Washington became a prominent lecturer of the Catholic faith and attended the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, D.C.|$|E

Here, Zita spent many hours with the old Emperor on both formal and informal occasions, where Franz Joseph confided in her his fears for the future. Emperor Franz Joseph died of bronchitis and pneumonia {{at the age of}} 86 on 21 November 1916. [...] "I remember the dear plump figure of Prince Lobkowitz going <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> husband," [...] Zita later recounted, [...] "and, with tears in his eyes, making {{the sign of the cross}} on Charles's forehead.

500|$|Gilbert {{was known}} for being {{sometimes}} prickly. [...] Aware of this general impression, he claimed that [...] "If you give me your attention", the misanthrope's song from Princess Ida, was a satiric self-reference, saying: [...] "I thought it my duty to live <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> reputation." [...] However, many people have defended him, often citing his generosity. [...] Actress May Fortescue recalled, [...] "His kindness was extraordinary. [...] On wet nights and when rehearsals were late and the last buses were gone, he would pay the cab-fares of the girls whether they were pretty or not, instead of letting them trudge home on foot... He was just as large-hearted when he was poor as when he was rich and successful. [...] For money as money he cared less than nothing. [...] Gilbert was no plaster saint, but he was an ideal friend." [...] The journalist Frank M. Boyd wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{there were}} exceptions, Terry-Thomas's screen {{characters}} were generally similar; Geoff Mayer wrote that [...] "although {{there would be}} variations, he would remain the 'rotter', a pretentious, elitist, seedy, sometimes lecherous cad with an eye for quick money and the easy life". Eric Sykes, with whom Terry-Thomas shared a number of screen moments, stated that it was [...] "always the same character and always funny". Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute, called him [...] "the definitive postwar cad or rotter". Terry-Thomas himself agreed with the view he presented, writing in the 1980s that [...] "T-T with his permanent air of caddish disdain... bounder... aristocratic rogue... upper-class English twit... genuine English eccentric... {{one of the last}} real gentlemen... wet, genteel Englishman... high-bred idiot... cheeky blighter... camel-haired cad... amiable buffoon... pompous Englishman... twentieth-century dandy... stinker... king of the cads... All those descriptions added <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> image as Terry-Thomas".|$|E

500|$|As the British {{military}} and loyal militia mopped up {{the remnants of}} the rebellion in Wexford and other counties, the atrocities and sectarian violence left a mark on Cornwallis. He wrote that [...] "the life of a Lord Lieutenant of Ireland comes <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> idea of a perfect misery; but if I can achieve the great object of consolidating the British Empire, I shall be sufficiently repaid." [...] In early July he issued a proclamation offering amnesty to rebels who laid down their arms and took an oath to the crown, and he cracked down on the sometimes arbitrary courts martial held in the field by requiring the review of all sentences in Dublin. [...] However, not all of Ireland received this treatment: areas that were still [...] "disturbed" [...] were exempted from the requirement, Lord Castlereagh, Cornwallis' Chief Secretary, reported that [...] "numbers were tried and executed" [...] without the lord lieutenant's review. One principal stronghold of the rebels was the Wicklow Mountains, through which the army began construction of a road facilitate its operations. [...] The Wicklow Military Road survives today as the R115 road in Wexford and Dublin.|$|E
500|$|In January 1991, {{following}} her departure from Automatic Dlamini, Harvey formed her own band with former bandmates Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver. Harvey decided {{to name the}} trio PJ Harvey after rejecting other names as [...] "nothing felt right at all or just suggested the wrong type of sound", and also {{to allow her to}} continue music as a solo artist. The trio consisted of Harvey on vocals and guitars, Ellis on drums and backing vocals, and Oliver on bass. Oliver later departed to rejoin the still-active Automatic Dlamini. He was subsequently replaced with Steve Vaughan. The trio's [...] "disastrous" [...] debut performance was held at a skittle alley in Charmouth Village Hall in April 1991. Harvey later recounted the event saying: [...] "we started playing and I suppose there was about fifty people there, and during the first song we cleared the hall. There was only about two people left. And a woman came up to us, came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> drummer, it was only a three piece, while we were playing and shouted at him 'Don't you realize nobody likes you! We'll pay you, you can stop playing, we'll still pay you!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Politics {{is present}} as an {{underlying}} theme in Spook Country {{to a greater}} extent than in any of the author's previous novels. The novel can be read as an exploration of the fear, uncertainty and pervasive paranoia of an America riven by the unending and divisive Iraq War. Although he had avoided overtly political themes in his previous work out of a distaste for didacticism, Gibson found that in the Bush era, politics had [...] "jacked itself <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> level of weirdness". Of the climate in Washington, D.C. during that period, he disclosed in a 2007 interview that [...] "I like the sheer sort of neo-Stalinist denial of reality. That's what makes it work. It's interesting." [...] Mike Duffy in Scotland on Sunday characterized the novel as a [...] "startling, effective guidebook to post-9/11 America"; Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times elaborated, proposing that it was [...] "arguably the first example of the post-post-9/11 novel, whose characters are tired of being pushed around by forces larger than they are – bureaucracy, history and, always, technology – and are at long last ready to start pushing back".|$|E

500|$|Store Frøen's rural {{surroundings}} {{shaped the}} nature of Nansen's childhood. In the short summers the main activities were swimming and fishing, while in the autumn the chief pastime was hunting for game in the forests. The long winter months were devoted mainly to skiing, which Nansen began to practice {{at the age of}} two, on improvised skis. [...] At the age of 10 he defied his parents and attempted the ski jump at the nearby Huseby installation. This exploit had near-disastrous consequences, as on landing the skis dug deep into the snow, pitching the boy forward: [...] "I, head first, described a fine arc in the air ... hen I came down again I bored into the snow <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> waist. The boys thought I had broken my neck, but as soon as they saw there was life in me ... a shout of mocking laughter went up." [...] Nansen's enthusiasm for skiing was undiminished, though as he records, his efforts were overshadowed by those of the skiers from the mountainous region of Telemark, where a new style of skiing was being developed. [...] "I saw this was the only way", wrote Nansen later.|$|E
500|$|We {{disliked the}} English {{language}} in the past. I disliked it because I was forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to learn it because of my age, and perhaps I would not be willing to do it because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in any way by flogging their idea of [...] "Hindi Imperialism" [...] to the maximum extent possible. So, it is <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> friends in Uttar Pradesh to have a whole India; it is up to them to have a Hindi-India. The choice is theirs.|$|E
500|$|While at Magdalen College, Wilde became {{particularly}} {{well known for}} his role in the aesthetic and decadent movements. He wore his hair long, openly scorned [...] "manly" [...] sports though he occasionally boxed, and decorated his rooms with peacock feathers, lilies, sunflowers, blue china and other objets d'art, once remarking to friends whom he entertained lavishly, [...] "I find it harder and harder every day to live <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> blue china." [...] The line quickly became famous, accepted as a slogan by aesthetes but used against them by critics who sensed in it a terrible vacuousness. Some elements disdained the aesthetes, but their languishing attitudes and showy costumes became a recognised pose. Wilde was once physically attacked by a group of four fellow students, and dealt with them single-handedly, surprising critics. By his third year Wilde had truly begun to create himself and his myth, and saw his learning developing in much larger ways than merely the prescribed texts. This attitude resulted in his being rusticated for one term, when he nonchalantly returned to college late from a trip to Greece with Prof. Mahaffy.|$|E

500|$|York's run of two {{straight}} losses ended after drawing 0–0 {{at home to}} Portsmouth, in which Brunt missed a header from fouryards in the third minute of stoppage time. Sheffield United's 19-year-old striker Diego De Girolamo, an Italy under-20 international, joined on a one-month youth loan {{as a result of}} injuries to Coulson, Fletcher and Hyde. De Girolamo scored seven minutes into his debut away to Newport County with a low finish, but after Penn was sent off for a second bookable offence the home team scored three goals in the second half, York losing the match 3–1. With York one place above the relegation zone Worthington resigned as manager, and was quoted saying [...] "In recent weeks, performances have not been <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> high standards and I take full responsibility for this". Steve Torpey, who was Worthington's assistant manager, took over as caretaker manager before Russ Wilcox was appointed as manager two days after Worthington's departure. Wilcox had been sacked as Scunthorpe United manager a week earlier with them second from bottom in the League One table, having led them to promotion the previous season as League Two runners-up.|$|E
500|$|Chopra {{said she}} studied method acting {{to make her}} {{character}} seem real. The actress said that her character is determined and added, [...] "While her father wants her to become an accountant she aspires to become the leading model in fashion industry". [...] Addressing rumours that the film was an exposé of the fashion industry, she said, [...] "It is nothing like that. Whatever problems that come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> character in the film are {{not because of the}} profession but because of the choices that my character makes in her life". Ranaut said, [...] "In this script my character is such that you get to express you emotions, emotions that you have never delivered before in front of the camera. So when I heard the script, it was something new and much more challenging, more interesting and exciting." [...] Godse said that she accepted her role in the film because she identified with her character, Janet Sequira, whom she described [...] as [...] "outgoing, vibrant, bold and outspoken". Arjan Bajwa described his character, an aspiring fashion model, as uncompromising, achieving success in his own way. Samir Soni found his role as a closeted fashion designer very challenging, requiring research to flesh out the character and his personality. Soni's greatest challenge was to avoid a stereotypical homosexual character, instead subtly expressing his sexuality in his personality and relationships with the film's other characters.|$|E
500|$|When {{starting}} {{out as a}} comedy writer, Appel recalled: [...] "One reason I caught <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> contemporaries is that when I started to send out my scripts, the idea that I'd been on the Lampoon, even 8 or 10 years before, was a credential I could use." [...] Appel got his first television job when David Mirkin hired him for the writing staff of The Simpsons in 1994, initially on a ten-week contract, {{and served as a}} writer and producer there for four years. There, he wrote seven episodes, often employing the use of [...] "joke sequences, a narrative approach to humor that eschews the quick laugh in favor of something that develops over time." [...] Appel found work on The Simpsons to be a learning curve because it was a [...] "very tough show to write for." [...] His first episode was season seven's [...] "Mother Simpson". Appel was desperately trying to think of a story idea to show and decided that he had to really reach out and opted to do something about Homer's mother, who previously had only been mentioned once. He named her Mona Simpson, after his wife. Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. The writers used the episode to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. Also for season seven he penned [...] "Bart on the Road", in which he utilized the plot devices of [...] "go to work with your parents day" [...] and Bart getting a driving license, and contributed to the episode [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield"; the two segments he wrote for the episode (one about Marge, the other about Lionel Hutz) were both cut. Appel wrote two episodes from season eight, [...] "Bart After Dark" [...] and [...] "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson", as well as season nine's [...] "The Two Mrs Nahasapeemapetilons" [...] and season 10's [...] "When You Dish Upon A Star".|$|E
