50|$|One chief {{engineer}} supervised the boilers {{with two men}} directly under him. To control the boilers, there was the head operator who, from the control desks, controlled steam production, while the sub-head operator gave instructions {{from the top of}} the boiler.

50|$|The {{most serious}} waste of fuel in a {{conventional}} steam locomotive {{is the loss of}} unburned coal particles from the fuel bed because of the rapid flow of air through the grate.

This was an extremely arduous job, one of the worst in the power station, since they had to endure the intense heat of the entire room, facing an opening in the furnace that brought the heat to extreme levels, constantly breathing the coal combustion by-products, such as smoke and boiler slag.|$|R
40|$|Coal {{exploited}} in {{the mine}} of Jerada (northeast of Morocco) was accompanied by large quantities of waste. The purpose of this work is to characterize this waste {{with the aim of}} its use as a material for civil engineering. Mineral and chemical investigations on this waste in the raw state, and at different temperature of heat treatments, were carried out by various methods: X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy. These analyzes showed that the studied waste, contain essentially a mineral part formed by silica and various clays, as well as <b>coal’s</b> <b>residues.</b> The thermal investigation of waste, by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), revealed an exothermic phenomenon attributed to the combustion of <b>coal</b> <b>residues.</b> Other phenomena were noted on the thermograms due to the mineral part transformations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the potential of ash waste in removal of Pb(II) ions from synthetic aqueous effluents. A low cost and effective adsorbent was used, power plant ash, for the removal of Pb(II). The maximum removal degree was obtained for pH value over 9. Kinetics study showed that removal degree was 83 % after 10 min of contact (vessel with agitation), and it increased at 98 % after 90 min. In the presence of lead ions, the natrium ions from ash did not dissolve; on the other hand the content of calcium ions from the liquid phase was increased. The retaining ability of the ash sample was 20 mg/g. The retaining ability of the samples was mainly attributed to the amorphous material, to the microporous minerals and to the relatively high percentage of <b>unburnt</b> <b>coal,</b> resulted during the combustion of the lignite. The ash waste in this study showed very good retaining capacity in comparison with the other adsorbents available in the literature...|$|R

Bacteria removed pyritic sulfur from both coals at maximum rates of 5 to 9 % per day, which was about 20 times the abiotic rate of pyrite oxidation. Concentrations of inorganic hazardous air pollutant (HAP) precursor elements in starting coal, bioleached coal and in leach solutions were measured. Of the 13 HAP precursors, significant amounts of arsenic, cobalt, cadmium, manganese, and nickel were removed from both coals by bacterial activity and also by the acidic leach solutions in control flasks.

The n-hexane soluble fractions increased {{with the increase of}} reaction temperature and time. Its amount increased from 14. 14 % to a maximum of 40. 86 % under the conditions of 470 °C and 30 min, which meant that moderate extension of coal residence time in the coal hydroliquefaction reactor is beneficial to the increase of oil yield.

A large quantity of total catalyst consisting of remained liquefaction catalyst, part of the mineral from raw coal and additive Fe-based catalyst could considerably reduce the apparent activation energy of hydro-conversion for the toluene insoluble/tetrahydrofuran insoluble fractions to 36. 79 kJ•mol- 1.

In coal utilization phase, the main characteristics are aggravation of greenhouse effect. The main characteristics of waste disposal phase are accumulation of negative ecological effects on the land. (3) The ecological risk of soil heavy metals is serious in coal utilization phase. The potential ecological hazard coefficients of Pb and As in <b>coal,</b> <b>residue</b> and ash are all lower than 40, presenting low environmental impact on soil; the potential ecological risk coefficients of Cd are higher than 60, nearly half of their potential ecological risk coefficients are higher than 160, which presents high environmental pollution impact on soil; Hg’s potential ecological risk coefficients are higher than 320, presenting the highest environmental pollution impact on soil; the comprehensive pollution indexes in <b>coal,</b> <b>residue,</b> and ash are relatively high, which means the pollution hazard potential to soil environment is high. (4) The ecological risk of the atmospheric solid suspended matter is relatively strong in coal utilization phase. The ecological risk of Cd and As in primary flue gas is both lower than net flue gas.
