25|$|In December 1945, Korea was {{administered}} by a U.S.-Soviet <b>Union</b> <b>Joint</b> Commission, as agreed at the Moscow Conference, {{with the aim}} of granting independence after a five-year trusteeship. The idea was not popular among Koreans and riots broke out. To contain them, the USAMGIK banned strikes on 8 December 1945 and outlawed the PRK Revolutionary Government and the PRK People's Committees on 12 December 1945. The right-wing Representative Democratic Council, led by Syngman Rhee, who had arrived with the U.S. military, opposed the trusteeship, arguing that Korea had already suffered from foreign occupation far too long. Following further large-scale civilian unrest, the USAMGIK declared martial law.|$|E
2500|$|Echoing earlier {{proposals}} made by Prime Minister Édouard Balladur of France, Schäuble {{and fellow}} lawmaker Karl Lamers in 1994 urged the European Union {{to adopt a}} policy they called [...] "variable geometry" [...] under which five countries most committed to integration – Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxemburg – would proceed swiftly toward monetary <b>union,</b> <b>joint</b> foreign and defense policies {{and other forms of}} integration. In 2014, both reiterated their ideas in an op-ed for the Financial Times, renewing their call for a core group of European Union countries to move ahead faster with economic and political integration. Countries such as Britain should put forward proposals for returning some competences to national governments, they said, while [...] "the EU should focus mainly on the following areas: a fair and open internal market; trade; currency and financial markets; climate, environment and energy; and foreign and security policy." [...] Also, they proposed the establishment of a European budget commissioner with powers to reject national budgets if they do not correspond to the jointly agreed rules and a [...] "eurozone parliament" [...] comprising the MEPs of eurozone countries to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of decisions affecting the single currency bloc.|$|E
