500|$|Mulan {{served as}} Wen's first voice-acting role. In an {{interview}} with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically {{the fact that she}} was required to record the majority of the character's dialogue in isolation, saying, [...] "I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was easy for me. I loved <b>using</b> <b>my</b> imagination. I felt like I was a little kid again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon. So it was a lot of fun for me." [...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{shortly after}} the overdubbing sessions, Spector {{said that he had}} asked whether any of the Beatles would like to help him produce the album, but none of them had wanted to. He also said that his hand was forced into {{remixing}} [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] due to the poor quality of Lennon's bass playing. Others agreed: in his book Revolution in the Head Beatles scholar Ian MacDonald wrote: [...] "The song was designed as a standard to be taken up by mainstream balladeers. [...] It features some atrocious bass-playing by Lennon, prodding clumsily around as if uncertain of the harmonies and making many comical mistakes. Lennon's crude bass playing on 'The Long and Winding Road,' though largely accidental, amounts to sabotage when presented as finished work." [...] Spector said that McCartney was being hypocritical in his criticism: [...] "Paul had no problem picking up the Academy Award for the Let It Be movie soundtrack, nor did he have any problem in <b>using</b> <b>my</b> arrangement of the string and horn and choir parts when he performed it during 25 years of touring on his own. If Paul wants to get into a pissing contest about it, he's got me mixed up with someone who gives a shit." ...|$|E
500|$|Travolta's {{involvement}} in Battlefield Earth was first publicized in late 1995. He told the New York Daily News that [...] "Battlefield Earth is {{the pinnacle of}} <b>using</b> <b>my</b> power for something. I told my manager, 'If we can't do the things now {{that we want to}} do, what good is the power? Let's test it and try to get the things done that we believe in.'" [...] It was assumed from the start that Travolta would star in and produce the film, which would be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; J. D. Shapiro was to write the screenplay. Shapiro was eventually fired because he refused to accept some suggestions from the studio producers that changed the tone of his script, including removing key scenes and characters. In 1997, Travolta's long-time manager, Jonathan Krane, signed a two-year deal with Twentieth Century Fox under which that studio would release Battlefield Earth instead of MGM, but the deal with Fox also fell through. James Robert Parish, author of Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, comments that both MGM and Fox regarded the project as too risky on several grounds: Its heavy reliance on special effects would be very expensive, pushing the budget up to as much as $100million; Hubbard's narrative was seen as naïve and outdated; and the [...] "Scientology factor" [...] could work against the film, negating Travolta's star power. As one studio executive put it, [...] "On any film there are ten variables that can kill you. On this film there was an eleventh: Scientology. It just wasn't something anyone really wanted to get involved with." ...|$|E

500|$|Davis {{received}} everyday {{playing time}} in 2012, starting at first base, at designated hitter, {{and in the}} outfield throughout the season. On May 6, in a 17-inning, 9-6 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Davis went hitless in eight at bats, but ended up being the winning pitcher. His feat {{was the first of}} its kind since Rube Waddell achieved it on July 4, 1905. Davis was the designated hitter until he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher in the 16th inning after Showalter had depleted the Orioles' bullpen. He struck out two batters and did not allow a run in his two innings of mound work. He was the first position player in the American League (AL) to be the winning pitcher in a game since Rocky Colavito on August 25, 1968, and the first to pitch for the Orioles since Manny Alexander on April 19, 1996. He and losing pitcher Darnell McDonald were the first position players on opposing teams in the same contest to each work in relief since Ty Cobb and George Sisler on October 4, 1925, and the first where both earned pitching decisions since Sam Mertes and Jesse Burkett on September 28, 1902. Davis described his outing: [...] "After the first inning, I was just trying to get it over the plate, and I was like, 'This is a lot harder than it looks.' I told myself to start <b>using</b> <b>my</b> legs so I didn't blow my arm out or anything like that. But in all seriousness, to get a win like that here, to end a road trip like this, it's huge. Neither team wanted to lose today, especially when it goes to extra innings. I mean, they would have pulled people out of the stands to finish that game. It's just a huge win for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp had {{attempted}} to persuade EastEnders writer Tony Jordan to develop a spin-off for their characters, which would star Windsor as Peggy. The idea never advanced beyond informal discussions, but when the producers decided to reintroduce Peggy, McFadden and Kemp suggested Windsor play her. Windsor had previously {{expressed a desire to}} join the cast of EastEnders. Chat show host Chris Evans of Channel 4's The Big Breakfast made a public broadcast instructing viewers to fax or phone the BBC with pleas for Windsor's instatement. However, Windsor was already in negotiations with the BBC about appearing in the serial. June Deitch, the EastEnders casting director, had met with Windsor to discuss the matter, and was convinced when Windsor declared that she would [...] "like to play my own age for a change". At the time, the producers had already thought about reintroducing Peggy, and Windsor was cast despite originally being considered too [...] "well-known". Windsor has spoken of her [...] "terrified" [...] reaction to being asked to audition, commenting: [...] "I had the weekend to prepare and I cried all the time. I didn't know how to do soap acting. I was so used to <b>using</b> <b>my</b> hands, my eyes." [...] She auditioned with two scenes, one emotion, one [...] "jolly" [...] which Windsor has described as [...] "agony", explaining: [...] "I was afraid of playing Barbara Windsor, so when I had to laugh I went 'huh, huh'. Anything rather than 'tee, hee, hee'." [...] In an interview with the Walford Gazette, a US-based newspaper dedicated to EastEnders, Windsor commented on her casting: [...] "I was thrilled, I could rest my tired bones working on a marvelous television show that I deeply respected. I was very excited about the possibility [...] playing this feisty lady who would come in and shake up her two boys' lives." ...|$|E
