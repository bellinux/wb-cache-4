One {{way to increase}} the performance {{is to increase the}} electrochemically active surface area available for the oxygen evolution reaction. In this study, we use high ion flux, low energy helium plasma exposure to nanostructure sputtered iron thin films. Subsequent annealing in air at 645 °C leads to the formation of PEC active hematite (?-Fe 2 O 3) phase in these films. The surface area, as derived from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), was seen to increase 10 – 40 times with plasma exposure. The photocurrent density increased by 2 – 5 times for the plasma exposed films as compared to the <b>unexposed</b> <b>films.</b> However, the less nanostructured film showed a higher photocurrent density. These findings were explained by detailed chemical and structural characterization in combination with electrochemical characterization and attributed to the presence of secondary elements in the film {{as well as to the}} presence of secondary iron oxide phases apart from hematite. This work demonstrates the complex effect of plasma exposure on both film morphology and chemical composition of PEC thin films and provides further understanding on how this technique can be used for nanostructuring of other functional films...|$|R

In this study, we aimed {{to evaluate the}} sensitometric characteristics of InSight (IP), a new F-speed film, in fresh and used processing solutions in dental office condition and compare them with Ektaspeed Plus (EP). Materials and Methods: In this experimental in vitro study, an aluminium step wedge was used to construct characteristic curves for InSight and Ektaspeed Plus films (Kodak Eastman, Rochester, USA). All films were processed in Champion solution (X-ray Iran, Tehran, Iran) both manually and automatically {{in a period of}} six days. <b>Unexposed</b> <b>films</b> of both types were processed manually and automatically to determine base plus fog density. Speed and film contrast were measured according to ISO definition. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and T tests with P&lt; 0. 05 as the level of significance. Results: IP was 20 to 22 % faster than EP and showed to be an F-speed film when processed in automatic condition and E-F film when processed manually. Also it was F-speed in fresh solution and E-speed in old solution. IP and EP contrasts were similar in automatic processing but EP contrast was higher when processed manually. Both EP and IP films had standard values of base plus fog (&lt; 0. 35) and B+F densities were decreased in old solution.

40|$|Rapid scan in-situ Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) {{was used}} to {{characterize}} the cure process of two common low-temperature cure thin film polymer materials for wafer-level packaging applications. Beside {{a discussion of the}} spectral changes during the cure reaction, aspects of quantification the degree of cure will be shown. First, a photosensitive low-temperature cure ester-type polyimide precursor was investigated. As this material is a negative working photosensitive polyimide precursor, the impact of the photo-crosslinking on the imidization rate will be discussed in comparison to <b>unexposed</b> <b>films.</b> It will be shown, that at certain temperature / time conditions the exposure dose should be carefully adjusted to yield fully imidized films with minimized cure temperatures. Second, the thermosetting process of a low-k polymer dielectric based on divinyl siloxane bis-benzocyclobutene (DVS bis-BCB) was studied. Due to the chemical nature of the DVS bis-BCB resin a highly crosslinked network is formed during the cure process. Especially above 80 % degree of cure at temperatures below 210 °C a significant reduction of the reaction rate was measured. A two step cure process was developed, which can minimize the process time at elevated temperatures and yield a rather high degree of conversion in a reasonable process time. Both polymer cure reactions are characterized by a chemically-controlled and a diffusion controlled region with significant different reaction rates. Based on the aforementioned results a time, temperature and conversion dependent kinetic / diffusion model {{was used to}} describe the experimental data quantitatively.

Every step of the picture taking process was totally manual, and success relied on in-depth knowledge, experience and calculation. Without through-the-lens viewing (which came later with reflex cameras), the camera was pre-focussed with a distance scale to where the subject was expected to be. The exposure was manually calculated, working out the best F-stop and shutter speed combination, and hoping that the light intensity did not change before the picture was taken. The light sensitivity of the film was very low, about ISO 10. (Later, ISO 400 - and above - film became readily available, allowing much faster shutter speeds). The emulsion was often on a fragile glass base. Only one picture could be taken before reloading with a fresh, <b>unexposed</b> plate. <b>Film</b> holders could only be loaded in complete darkness, necessitating a light-proof changing-bag.

40|$|A novel method (in-situ {{quantitative}} {{infrared spectroscopy}} of evolved C 02) for studying photo-degradation {{has been developed}} and applied {{to the study of}} several different polymers including a series of polyethylene and poly (vinyl chloride) samples containing Ti 02 pigments with different photo-activitics. Infrared (IR) analysis was used to monitor carbon dioxide emitted from samples exposed to ultraviolet irradiation (UV) in atmospheres of differing composition. The experiments were conducted in a specially constructed cell that permits simultaneous UV exposure of the sample and IR interrogation of the vapour in the cell. It has been demonstrated that the in-situ gas-phase method permits a fast and convenient way of assessing the durability of pigmented and unpigmented polymer. A single test on one material occupied about 7 hours - very much less than conventional artificial weathering exposures. Excellent correlation between the C 02 method and the conventional method for measuring carbonyl groups in the polyethylene films has been demonstrated, The Ti 02 pigments used included anatase and rutiles with different surface treatments. Anatase-pigmented material gave significantly higher C 02 emission than unpigmented polyethylene. The rutile-pigmented polyethylenes either gave reduced C 02 emission or enhanced emission, according to the surface treatment. The ranking of the pigments as protectants or pro-degradants coincided with that obtained from much more time consuming laboratory testing and field experience. Similar results were obtained for the poly (vinyl chloride). The CO 2 method is a convenient way to study the factors (humidity, oxygen concentration and UV intensity or wavelength), which influence the rate of carbon dioxide evolution i. e. the rate of photo-oxidation of the polymers. Blown polyethylene(PE) film was exposed to UV irradiation while held under tensile stress in a specially designed metal frame. The chemical degradation was followed using the FTIR carbonyl index. Tests were conducted on unpigmented PE and on a series of five PEs containing TiO 2 pigments with different photo-activities. The yield strengths measured in tensile tests on <b>unexposed</b> <b>films</b> were typically 10 % greater in the longitudinal(machine) direction than in the transverse direction. UV exposures were conducted with stress applied both parallel and transverse to the machine direction. For all six materials, tensile stress accelerated carbonyl group development, Some samples cracked during UV exposure in tension and did so in a shorter time if the stress was applied in the machine direction than if it was transverse to it. The carbonyl index at the onset of cracking was lower for longitudinal samples than for transverse samples. Unpigmented PE was slightly more sensitive to transverse strain and the anatasepigmented PE slightly more sensitive to longitudinal strain.
