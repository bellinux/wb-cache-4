40|$|AIM—To assess initial {{experience}} of cardiac catheterisation in children by the transhepatic approach where conventional venous access is impossible.  PATIENTS AND METHODS—Percutaneous transhepatic cardiac catheterisation {{was performed on}} six occasions in five children (three male) aged 4  to 36  months (mean 17  months). All children had documented femoral venous occlusion and all but one had occlusion of the superior vena cava. Ultrasound was used {{in five of the}} six procedures to help identify a large hepatic vein. A 4  F or 5  F sheath was introduced into the vein <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seldinger</b> <b>technique.</b> In the fourth patient, hepatic venous access was obtained immediately without the assistance of ultrasound.  RESULTS—Percutaneous transhepatic catheterisation was successfully performed at all six attempts.

30|$|Percutaneous pleural drain {{positioning}} is {{the third}} most technical procedure performed {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU) after vascular catheterization and tracheal intubation. Pleural drain positioning can constitute a crucial maneuver for the treatment of critically ill patients [1 – 3]; for example, it has the potential to improve respiratory function, thereby avoiding intubation in spontaneous breathing patients or leading to earlier weaning in patients under mechanical ventilation. Because of its paramount clinical utility, chest tube positioning has become an incumbent skill for many specialists, such as general surgeons, intensivists, pulmonologists, and emergency medicine specialists [4, 5]. However, pleural drainage is burdened by substantial risks and can result in potentially serious harm if not performed accurately [6, 7]. Even if small-bore tubes are inserted <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seldinger</b> <b>technique,</b> the procedure is not without risk due to the many major vascular and visceral structures that lay in close proximity to the usual insertion sites and the course of the chest tubes [8].

30|$|Regarding the {{angiography}} procedure itself, most authors {{described a}} standard approach via the common femoral artery (CFA).

Our local practice is to start with an aortogram to delineate the anatomy first, then guided by CT positive findings a direct catheterisation of the suspected internal iliac artery would follow. Contrast is then injected to identify the bleeding point, identified as a focus of contrast extravasation/blush. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is used to guide the operator along the arterial map (49). Standard catheter use is by default recommended at our institution. However, if the bleeding point is not evident, further selective micro-catheterisation and angiogram of the pelvic arterial branches on the affected side is necessary to identify the bleeding point. Once this is evident, the bleeding artery is embolised accordingly {{using a variety of}} embolic material (e.g. micro-coils and/or glue), which is further discussed below.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the success and complication rates of preferred percutaneous nephrostomies (PCNs) performed in our clinics over a one-year period by different physicians. Material and Methods: During 2008, {{a total of}} 79 PCNs were performed in 65 patients by two different techniques. We employed two different techniques: a “Seldinger” technique (by guide-wire insertion and track dilatation), with ultrasonography guidance, and “one-stab” technique.

Materials and MethodsIn the past 3 years, 50 ER patients underwent percutaneous, transhepatic, sono-guided trocar drainage of the gallbladder. We retrospectively reviewed the patients' clinical courses, complications and outcomes. ResultsThe clinical diagnoses of the 50 ER patients included 30 with acute cholecystitis, 10 with distal common bile duct (CBD) obstruction with cholangitis and cholecystitis, seven with gallbladder empyema and three with rupture of gallbladder empyema with liver abscess. Of the 50 patients, 29 received non-surgical treatment, while 21 subsequently underwent elective cholecystectomy. Percutaneous transhepatic sono-guided trocar drainage of the gallbladder was successful in all patients. The overall mortality rate was 10 %, but the patients did not die due to the procedure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied the safety of urgent CVC procedures in haematological patients including those with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 30 × 10 (9) /L). From January 1999 to June 2009, 431 CVC insertional procedures in 431 consecutive patients were evaluated.

The catheters were defined as sterile when the tip culture was negative; contaminated, when the tip culture was positive and peripheral blood culture was either negative or positive for different bacteria; septic when both tip and blood were positive for the same bacteria. The results indicated that 10 catheters were contaminated and 17 were septic. Eight previously sterile CVC were found positive after the exchange: 3 were removed at the end of TPN in asymptomatic patients, and 5 were successfully resterilized by means of one more change. Guidewire replacement allowed CVC sterilization of 22 of 24 catheters (91. 6 %). No complications due to the catheter-changing method were see...|$|R
30|$|Intra-abdominal {{collections}} and abscesses represent {{the most common}} complication following pancreatic surgery [1 – 3]. Once an intra-abdominal collection is identified, in most cases {{it is possible to}} place a percutaneous drainage under image guidance. When the collection is well visible using ultrasound (US), US-guided percutaneous drainage placement is generally the preferred choice, as US is widely available, easy to handle and allows for real-time monitoring of the drainage placement, being also free from ionising radiation [24]. When the collection is located deep in the abdomen and is not well seen at US, computed tomography (CT) generally offers good anatomical definition to guide the safe placement of a percutaneous drainage. Drainage placement can be performed <b>using</b> <b>the</b> trocar or <b>Seldinger</b> <b>technique.</b> In <b>the</b> trocar technique, the drainage catheter containing a trocar needle is inserted directly into the collection. The trocar technique provides a fast deployment of the drainage that can be extremely helpful in critically ill or agitated patients. <b>The</b> <b>Seldinger</b> <b>technique</b> implies multiple steps: the collection is punctured with a small calibre needle, different calibre guidewires are inserted and the drainage is then advanced up to the collection over <b>the</b> guidewire. <b>The</b> <b>Seldinger</b> <b>technique</b> is particularly helpful when there is a small window to reach the collection, as typically happens when a retroperitoneal collection has to be drained through an anterior approach. The main disadvantage of this technique is that it may require considerably longer time than the trocar technique. The correct location of the needle or drainage can be confirmed by aspiration of a small amount of material. Furthermore, a small amount of iodinated contrast may be injected through the catheter to identify the presence of an underlying fistula.|$|R

However, with the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>Seldinger</b> <b>technique,</b> angiography became a relatively risk-free procedure, and the field of interventional radiology blossomed.|$|R
