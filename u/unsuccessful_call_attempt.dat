40|$|The {{choice of}} number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> in a {{telephone}} survey is an important decision. A large number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> makes the data collection costly and time-consuming; and {{a small number of}} attempts decreases the response set from which conclusions are drawn and increases the variance. The decision can also {{have an effect on the}} nonresponse bias. In this paper we study the effects of number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> on the nonresponse rate and the nonresponse bias in two surveys conducted by Statistics Sweden: The Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Household Finances (HF). By use of paradata we calculate the response rate as a function of the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> To estimate the nonresponse bias we use estimates of some register variables, where observations are available for both respondents and nonrespondents. We also calculate estimates of some real survey parameters as functions of varying number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> The results indicate that it is possible to reduce the current number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> without getting an increased nonresponse bias...|$|R
40|$|In {{telephone}} surveys, several <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> {{are often}} needed {{to establish contact}} with selected individuals. We consider the problem of choosing {{the maximum number of}} <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> to be made to each selected individual before he or she is classified as unavailable. This is an important question since a large number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> makes the data collection costly and time-consuming; a small number of attempts decreases the response set from which conclusions are drawn. We start from the assumptions that the survey goal is to estimate a population total, that the sample can be divided into response homogeneity groups, and that the direct weighting estimator is to be used. We suggest a strategy for choosing the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> that takes the survey design, non-response, measurement errors and costs of data collection into account. The strategy relies on models for non-response and measurement errors. In our models, the impact of the error sources on the estimator may differ for different numbers of <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> According to our strategy, the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> is decided through a comparison of the estimator’s standard error for different numbers of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> but the same cost. Next we study the case when the response homogeneity groups do not work properly but there remains a non-response bias.

When the blocking ratio exceeds some grade of service level, {{the capacity of the}} congested cell must be replanned using the <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> data. However, most of the time, the measurements are inflated by the redials and the retrials. During the replanning process, the first step should be to calculate the effective load from the measured cumulative call statistics. In this paper, we provide simpleto-implement analytical models that compute the average number of retrials and redials per original <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> using only the operations and maintenance center (OMC) measurements.

40|$|Introduction We {{consider}} {{the suitability of}} Lotos for modelling and analysing an online feature manager. The work forms {{part of a larger}} project on hybrid methods for feature interaction detection and resolution. In modern telecommunications networks features such as Waiting" (a subscriber is informed when a <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> is made to an busy line) or Ringing" (where a number of telephones reacts to an incoming <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> and the <b>call</b> can be answered at any phone) are common. The number of features is steadily increasing. Further, a general move towards an open market leads to more suppliers of features. Features are added functionality, they are developed independent of each other and are tested. However, making features available together introduces the potential for interaction between them: two features might react to the same trigger (for example a <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> to a busy line) and oer dierent ways of handling this.

To characterise the population that generates the offered traffic it is more important the time between <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> This is a difficult measure as it needs to be induced from other measures: attempts are not seen when they really occur, but when the system allocates a radio-channel to them. Two methods to obtain the coefficient of variation of the time between <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> are presented. Based on the proposed procedures we show that in our system the infinite population assumption is far from the true situation.
