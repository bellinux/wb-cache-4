He suspected even while he obeyed that upward flourish which was his own essential characteristic. He had a peculiar feeling that somehow that <b>upward</b> <b>bias</b> would betray him; that from exaltation he might presently float off, into the higher, the better, and so to complete unreality. He fled from priggishness and the terror of such sublimity alike to Prothero. Moreover, in relation to so many things Prothero in a peculiar distinctive manner SAW. He had less self-control than Benham, less integrity of purpose, less concentration, and things that were before his eyes were by the very virtue of these defects invariably visible to him. Things were able to insist upon themselves with him. Benham, on the other hand, when facts contradicted his purpose too stoutly, had a way of becoming blind to them. He repudiated inconvenient facts. He mastered and made his world; Prothero accepted and recorded his. Benham was a will towards the universe where Prothero was a perception and Amanda a confusing responsive activity. And it was because of his realization of this profound difference between them that he was possessed by the idea of taking Prothero with him about the world, as a detachable kind of vision--rather like that eye the Graiae used to hand one another....|$|E

I show that tax revenue forecasts for themedium-term are <b>upward</b> <b>biased.</b> Overoptimistic revenue projections are particularly pronounced after the German reunification and reflect upward-biased GDP projections in this period. The predicted tax-GDP-ratio appears to be <b>upward</b> <b>biased,</b> as well. The forecasts are likely to overestimate tax revenues if the redicted tax-GDP-ratio exceeds its structural level of approximately 22 percentage points. The results also indicate that forecast errors of short-term projections for the current year exhibit serial correlation.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examine the}} relationship between free-viewing vertical and horizontal perceptual biases. In Experiment 1, normal participants (n= 24) made forced-choice luminance judgments on two mirror-reversed luminance gradients (the 2 ̆ 7 grayscales 2 ̆ 7 task). The stimuli were presented in vertical, horizontal and oblique (+/- 45 degrees) orientations. Leftward and <b>upward</b> <b>biases</b> were observed in the horizontal and vertical conditions, respectively. In the oblique conditions, leftward and <b>upward</b> <b>biases</b> combined to produce a strong shift of attention away from the lower/right space toward the upper/left. Regression analyses revealed that the oblique biases were the combined product of the vertical and horizontal biases. A lack of correlation between the vertical and horizontal biases, however, suggests they reflect the operation of independent cognitive/neural mechanisms. In Experiment 2, the same stimuli were given to right-hemisphere-lesioned patients with spatial neglect (n = 4). Rightward and <b>upward</b> <b>biases</b> were observed for horizontal and vertical stimuli, respectively. The biases combined to produce a strong shift of attention away from the lower/left space toward the upper/right. While our research demonstrates that vertical and horizontal attentional biases are additive, it also appears that they reflect the operation of independent cognitive/neural mechanisms. Potential applications of these findings to the remediation of spatial neglect are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The {{binomial}} sum variance inequality {{states that}} the variance of the sum of binomially distributed random variables will always be {{less than or equal}} to the variance of a binomial variable with the same n and p parameters. In probability theory and statistics, the sum of independent binomial random variables is itself a binomial random variable if all the component variables share the same success probability. If success probabilities differ, the probability distribution of the sum is not binomial. The lack of uniformity in success probabilities across independent trials leads to a smaller variance. and is a special case of a more general theorem involving the expected value of convex functions. In some statistical applications, the standard binomial variance estimator can be used even if the component probabilities differ, though with a variance estimate that has an <b>upward</b> <b>bias.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Commission {{concluded}} {{that more than}} half of the overestimation was due to slow adjustments in the index to new products or changes in product quality. At that time, the weights for indices like CPI-U and CPI-W were updated only once per decade; today, they are updated in January of even-numbered years. However, even with this more frequent updates, the CPI-U and CPI-W might still be excessively slow in responding to new technologies. For example, by 1996 there were over 47 million cellular phone users in the United States, but the weights for the CPI did not account for this new product until 1998. This new product lowered costs of communication when away from the home. The commission recommended that the BLS update weights more frequently to prevent <b>upward</b> <b>bias</b> in the index from a failure to properly account for the benefits of new products.|$|E

In explaining its preference for the PCE, the Board stated:The chain-type price PCE index draws extensively on data from the consumer price index but, while not entirely free of measurement problems, has several advantages relative to the CPI. The PCE chain-type index is constructed from a formula that reflects the changing composition of spending and thereby avoids some of the <b>upward</b> <b>bias</b> associated with the fixed-weight nature of the CPI. In addition, the weights are based on a more comprehensive measure of expenditures. Finally, historical data used in the PCE price index can be revised to account for newly available information and for improvements in measurement techniques, including those that affect source data from the CPI; the result is a more consistent series over time.—Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,Federal Reserve Board of Governors,Feb. 17, 2000 ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{study the}} timing of high school dropout {{decisions}} using data from High School and Beyond. I propose a Bayesian proportional hazard analysis framework {{that takes into account}} the specification of piecewise constant baseline hazard, the time-varying covariate of dropout eligibility, and individual, school, and state level random effects in the dropout hazard. I find that students who have reached their state compulsory school attendance ages are more likely to drop out of high school than those who have not reached compulsory school attendance ages. Regarding the school quality effects, a student is more likely to drop out of high school if the school she attends is associated with a higher pupil-teacher ratio or lower district expenditure per pupil. An interesting finding of the paper that comes along with the empirical results is that failure to account for the time-varying heterogeneity in the hazard, in this application, results in <b>upward</b> <b>biases</b> in the duration dependence estimates. Moreover, these <b>upward</b> <b>biases</b> are comparable in magnitude to the well-known downward biases in the duration dependence estimates when the modeling of the time-invariant heterogeneity in the hazard is absent.

In Experiment 1, normal participants (n = 35) made forced-choice luminance judgments on two mirror-reversed luminance gradients (the 2 ̆ 7 greyscales 2 ̆ 7 task) presented in vertical and horizontal orientations.
