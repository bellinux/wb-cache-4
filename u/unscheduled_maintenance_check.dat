40|$|This project {{consisted}} {{of working with}} the Super Web, referred to as the printer, at the Avery Dennison facility located in Rochelle. There was a large amount of downtime associated with the printer. The scheduled downtime was the main cause, however the interest was in reducing the unscheduled downtime. The main causes of the unscheduled downtime were materials, <b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> and not staffed. The problem associated with materials was not having mylar to run the printer. The <b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> was mainly due to problems with the punches, plates, blankets and knives. Finally, there were occurrences in which the machine was not staffed due to operator absenteeism or the operator helping on another machine. The recommendations made to reduce the unscheduled downtime included having a safety stock of mylar, increasing the preventative maintenance before an order is run, determining how long the punches and blankets last, having two plates available and hiring parttime employees if needed. Other recommendations included doing a follow-up analysis and ensuring the work center monitor sheets are filled out consistently. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R

40|$|The {{operating}} costs of civilian aircraft {{are crucial to}} air carriers. These costs currently offset more than 95 % of their revenues, and maintenance represents around 10 - 20 % of these {{operating costs}}. Thus, minimizing <b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> is an important cost saving opportunity. Currently, primary flight actuators are based on electro-hydraulic technologies, and they are maintained by scheduled operational tests {{in accordance with the}} Maintenance Steering Group- 3 (MSG- 3) process. This paper discusses the potential of utilizing Prognostic-Based Maintenance (PrM) to minimize <b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> of primary flight control actuators. Two perspectives will be considered: the MSG- 3 based maintenance program and electro-mechanical actuation (EMA) - EMA is a promising technology for actuation in future aircraft. PrM and some of MSG- 3 maintenance tasks have similar features that may be used to implement new PrM applications. Further, the EMA perspective involves a case study of a PrM system dedicated to monitoring the rolling contact fatigue of an EMA ball bearing. The PrM potential for aircraft systems has been investigated in numerous studies on the system level; however, practical utilization necessitates more focus on the component level related to specific failure modes...|$|R
50|$|The {{motivation}} for pre-estimate aggregation {{may be that}} no ground truth data are available. This may occur in situations where diagnostics {{does a good job}} in detecting faults that are resolved (through maintenance) before system failure occurs. Therefore, there are hardly any run-to-failure data. However, there is incentive to know better when a system would fail to better leverage the remaining useful life {{while at the same time}} avoiding <b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> (<b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> is typically more costly than scheduled maintenance and results in system downtime). Garga et al. REF describe conceptually a pre-estimate aggregation hybrid approach where domain knowledge is used to change the structure of a neural network, thus resulting in a more parsimonius representation of the network. Another way to accomplish the pre-estimate aggregation is by a combined off-line process and on-line process: In the off-line mode, one can use a physics-based simulation model to understand the relationships of sensor response to fault state; In the on-line mode, one can use data to identify current damage state, then track the data to characterize damage propagation, and finally apply an individualized data-driven propagation model for remaining life prediction.|$|R

40|$|LED {{lighting}} systems have become desirable {{because of their}} environmental and energy-saving advantages. The lack of information regarding LED reliability is a barrier to the further expansion of LED use, especially in large-scale applications such as street lighting and traffic lights, and safety-related applications such as automotive headlights. Prognostics and health management (PHM) techniques can be utilized to provide LED reliability information to remove this barrier. However, the return on investment (ROI) for LED {{lighting systems}} has been of concern. To reduce life cycle cost, a PHM maintenance approach with system health monitoring (SHM) is considered {{as a means of}} providing early warning of failure, reducing <b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> events, and extending the time interval of maintenance cycles. This paper presents the ROI from a PHM maintenance approach with SHM in LED lighting systems compared with the <b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> approach based on different exponential and normal failure distributions. Three different exponential distributions with 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % failure rates were used to investigate how ROI changes with different failure rates. For each failure rate, the mean times to failure (MTTFs) were 41, 000 h, 20, 500 h, and 13, 667 h, respectively. Three normal failure distributions with the same MTTFs as those of the exponential distributions were utilized to compare the results with the exponential distributions. ROI results showed that the PHM maintenance approach with SHM is required for cost savings in the exponential failure distributions. In case of the normal distributions, the PHM maintenance approach with SHM shows ROI benefits when MTTFs are less than 30, 000 h. The PHM maintenance approach with SHM needs to be considered in industrial applications based on the reliability of LED lighting systems to maximize the ROI benefit when the total life cycle cost of the system employing the <b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> is greater than the total life cycle cost of the system employing the PHM maintenance approach with SHM.

40|$|Naturelink Aviation is {{involved}} in Private Air Charters, Aircraft Leasing, Aircraft Sales, In- house Training and Maintenance. The company has a fleet of eleven Embraer EMB 120 and six PAC P 750 XL aircraft contracted in services across Africa. Naturelink Aviation seeks improvement regarding the management of inventory for <b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> at outstations in Africa. It was established that the company {{does not have an}} automated inventory systems for the outstations, mainly because outstations are dependent on contracts. Currently the engineer at the outstation has to manage the <b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> inventory and determine when top-up stock needs to be ordered. The decision was made to develop a multiproduct Economic Order Quantity model to determine optimal order quantities, number of cycles and order times. The main objective is to determine when items of different frequency usage can be ordered together instead of sending orders only days apart. After this project it was clear that reorder points often coincide or happen close together in addition to the crew rotation schedule. This information enabled the development of a sample reorder schedule, it requires constant updated and verifications, because reorder points and EOQs may change. Naturelink Aviation will now test the schedule and if needed rectifications and adjustments will be made before the final distribution and implementation among the fleet. Thesis (B Eng.
