The classification {{of the houses}} as substandard {{was based on an}} assessment of structural integrity which would affect air exchange rates. In these homes, <b>unvented</b> gas <b>space</b> <b>heaters</b> were operated as the primary source of heat. ^ The Ogawa passive sampling device was used to measure NO 2 concentrations over 24 to 48 -hour periods during generally cold weather. A sampler was placed in the kitchen and bedroom of each house. The female head of household was asked to wear a monitor during area monitoring to assess her personal exposure. Outdoor levels of NO 2 were also measured. ^ Mean (standard deviation) levels of kitchen, bedroom and personal exposures were 280 (125) ppb, 256 (155) ppb and 164 (102) ppb, respectively. Additional short-term (3 ̆c 24 hours) samples were measured in three houses.

50|$|In {{domestic}} heating systems with pilot lights {{it has been}} estimated that half of the total energy usage is from the pilot light, with each pilot light on average using between 70 and 500 watts of gas power (between 8 and 16 gigajoules/year). The heat from a pilot light in many appliances (furnaces, <b>space</b> <b>heaters,</b> water heaters) is generally released in the same chamber as the primary burner.The energy loss is much smaller for pilot lights in <b>space</b> <b>heaters</b> than other products, because <b>space</b> <b>heaters</b> heat a smaller enclosed space and contribute more significantly to heating the room. The appliance efficiency of a gas fired balanced flue local <b>space</b> <b>heater</b> in pilot light mode is almost equal with the appliance efficiency measured at the reduced power of the appliance, which efficiency is between 65 - 95% based on the low calorific value of the consumed gas, making part of the pilot lights energy consumption into a useful heat.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, the {{importance}} of energy saving is clearance to everyone. By attention to increasing price of fuels and also the problems of environment pollutions, there are the most efforts for using fuels littler and more optimum in everywhere. This essay studies optimizing of gas consumption in gas-burner <b>space</b> <b>heaters.</b> In oven of each gas-burner <b>space</b> <b>heaters</b> there is two snags to prevent the hot air (the result of combustion of natural gas) {{to go out of}} oven of the gas-burner <b>space</b> <b>heaters</b> directly without delivering its heat to the space of favorite environment like a room. These snags cause a excess circulating that helps hot air deliver its heat to the space of favorite environment. It means the exhaust air temperature will be decreased then when there are no snags. This is the aim of this essay to use maximum potential energy of the natural gas to make heat. In this study, by the help of a finite volume software (FLUENT) consumption of the gas-burner <b>space</b> <b>heaters</b> is simulated and optimized. At the end of this writing, by comparing the results of software and experimental results, it will be proved the authenticity of this method.
