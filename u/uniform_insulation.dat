40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{are considered}} the most promising candidates to replace Cu and Al in {{a large number of}} electrical, mechanical and thermal applications. Although most CNT industrial applications require macro and micro size CNT fiber assemblies, several techniques to make conducting CNT fibers, threads, yarns and ropes have been reported to this day, and improvement of their electrical and mechanical conductivity continues. Some electrical applications of these CNT conducting fibers require an insulating layer for electrical insulation and protection against mechanical tearing. Ideally, a flexible insulator such as hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR) on the CNT fiber can allow fabrication of CNT coils that can be assembled into lightweight, corrosion resistant electrical motors and transformers. HNBR is a largely used commercial polymer that unlike other cable-coating polymers such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), it provides unique continuous and uniform coating on the CNT fibers. The polymer coated/insulated CNT fibers have a 26. 54 μm average diameter—which is approximately four times the diameter of a red blood cell—is produced by a simple dip-coating process. Our results confirm that HNBR in solution creates a few microns <b>uniform</b> <b>insulation</b> and mechanical protection over a CNT fiber that is used as the electrically conducting core...|$|E
40|$|The "loopless antenna" is an interventional MRI {{detector}} {{consisting of}} a tuned coaxial cable and an extended inner conductor or "whip". A limitation is the poor sensitivity afforded at, and immediately proximal to, its distal end, which is exacerbated by the extended whip length when the whip is uniformly insulated. It is shown here that tapered insulation dramatically improves the distal sensitivity of the loopless antenna by pushing the current sensitivity toward the tip. The absolute signal-to-noise ratio is numerically computed by the electromagnetic method-of-moments for three resonant 3 -T antennae with no insulation, <b>uniform</b> <b>insulation,</b> and with linearly tapered insulation. The analysis shows that tapered insulation provides an ∼ 400 % increase in signal-to-noise ratio in trans-axial planes 1 cm from the tip and a 16 -fold increase in the sensitive area as compared to an equivalent, uniformly insulated antenna. These findings are directly confirmed by phantom experiments and by MRI of an aorta specimen. The results demonstrate that numerical electromagnetic signal-tonoise ratio analysis can accurately predict the loopless detector's signal-to-noise ratio and {{play a central role}} in optimizing its design. The manifold improvement in distal signal-to-noise ratio afforded by redistributing the insulation should improve the loopless antenna's utility for interventional MRI. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHeat {{conduction}} in solids {{subjected to}} non-homogenous boundary conditions leads to singularities {{in terms of}} heat flux density. That kind of issues can be also encountered in various scientists' fields as electromagnetism, electrostatic, electrochemistry and mechanics. These problems are difficult to solve by using the classical methods such as integral transforms or separation of variables. These methods lead to solving of dual integral equations or Fredholm integral equations, which {{are not easy to}} use. The present work addresses the calculation of thermal resistance of a finite medium submitted to conjugate surface Neumann and Dirichlet conditions, which are defined by a band-shape heat source and a uniform temperature. The opposite surface is subjected to a homogeneous boundary condition such <b>uniform</b> temperature, or <b>insulation.</b> The proposed solving process is based on simple and accurate correlations that provide the thermal resistance {{as a function of the}} ratio of the size of heat source and the depth of the medium. A judicious scale analysis is performed in order to fix the asymptotic behaviour at the limits of the value of the geometric parameter. The developed correlations are very simple to use and are valid regardless of the values of the defined geometrical parameter. The performed validations by comparison with numerical modelling demonstrate the relevant agreement of the solutions to address singularity calculation issues...|$|R
