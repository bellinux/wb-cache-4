40|$|Abstract. The DIRECT {{algorithm}} {{was motivated}} by a modification to Lip-schitzian optimization. The algorithm begins its search by sampling the ob-jective function at the midpoint of an interval, where this function attains its lowest value, and then divides this interval by trisecting it.

We present a one-dimensional variante of the DIRECT algorithm based on another strat-egy of sudividing the search domain. It consists of decreasing the number of intervals and increasing the number of sampling points, by interverting the roles of dividing and sampling at some steps of the DIRECT algorithm, and thus, overcoming this disadvantage. 1.

Providing their powers are within certain ranges, the covariant higher derivatives cure the superficial divergence {{of all but}} a set of one-loop graphs. The finiteness of these latter graphs is ensured by properties of the supergroup and gauge invariance.

40|$|Accelerometry {{has always}} been a popular method of {{monitoring}} locomotor activity but its use is becoming more widespread due to the easy availability of low cost, low power sensors. However one of the major problems with interpreting accelerometer data is that rotation of the sensor alters the output and obtaining independent orientation information is currently difficult. For the specific case of leaping locomotion full orientation information is <b>unecessary</b> as long as an independent measure of height change is available such as can be obtained from a sensitive pressure sensor. Therefore a 4 channel logging system recording 3 accelerometry axes combined with a channel measuring pressure could be used to accurately assess leaping locomotion. This approach should also work for any locomotion where acceleration is limited to the vertical plane but in practice it may be restricted by the sensitivity and acquisition characteristics of the pressure measurement system. Ultimately it should be a useful addition to the range of measurements available for remote locomotor monitoring particularly for leaping species such as lemurs and other non-human primates...|$|E

The {{result is an}} <b>unecessary</b> loss of performance, because the fixed schedules are designed to accommodate {{a wide range of}} engine health. These fixed control schedules may not be optimal for a deteriorated engine. This problem may be solved by including a measure of deterioration in determining the control variables. These engine deterioration parameters usually cannot be measured directly but can be estimated. A Kalman filter design is presented for estimating two performance parameters that account for engine deterioration: high and low pressure turbine delta efficiencies. The delta efficiency parameters model variations of the high and low pressure turbine efficiencies from nominal values. The filter has a design condition of Mach 0. 90, 30, 000 ft altitude, and 47 deg power level angle (PLA). It was evaluated using a nonlinear simulation of the F 100 engine model derivative (EMD) engine, at the design Mach number and altitude over a PLA range of 43 to 55 deg. It was found that known high pressure turbine delta efficiencies of - 2. 5 percent and low pressure turbine delta efficiencies of - 1. 0 percent can be estimated with an accuracy of + or - 0. 25 percent efficiency with a Kalman filter.

40|$|In {{the setting}} of a {{maternal}} GBS-screening program and successful implementation of the strategy, efforts to improve screening for GBS status remain important. Critical factors that influence the accuracy of detecting GBS maternal colonization are the choice of culture media, the body sites sampled, and the timing of sampling. The evolution of the different culture options to improve the GBS-screening strategy will be reviewed. Despite efforts related to sampling and culture procedures, false-negative GBS-screening contributing to continuing EOGBS cases and false-positive screening leading to <b>unecessary</b> IAP, occur. As GBS carriage is highly variable, the predictive values of GBS antenatal cultures are not always good predictors of the maternal GBS status at presentation for delivery. Rapid non-cultural GBS screening methods have been developed: antigenic tests are not sensitive enough to replace antenatal screening cultures but available real-time PCR have faired better in the detection of GBS. Real-time PCR tests could improve effectiveness of the screening-based strategy and lead to a further reduction of the incidence of EOGBS disease. However questions of costs and logistics remain unanswered. Either for therapy or for intrapartum chemoprophylaxis, penicillin G for its bactericidal activity and narrow spectrum, remains the agent of choice. But in the true penicillin allergic patients, clindamycin or erythromycin have been recommended as alternative drugs.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic findings of hysterosalpingography (HSG) examinations of infertile females. Material and Method: A retrospective examination {{was made of}} all the records of HSG procedure applied in a university infertility clinic between January and December 2015. The diagnostic findings were analysed in those evaluated as abnormal HSG. Results: The records were examined of 610 HSG procedures applied during the study period. The mean age of patients was determined as 26. 7 ± 5. 9 years. In 145 (23. 8 %) of the total HSG applications, at least 1 abnormality was determined. The most common abnormality was tubal occlusion, which was determined {{in a total of}} 77 (12. 6 %) patients; 56 unilateral (9. 1 %) and 21 bilateral (3. 5 %). In three (0. 5 %) cases, filling defect was determined in the uterine cavity, and in three (0. 5 %) cases in the cervical canal. Mullerian anomaly was determined in 51 (8. 4 %) patients, of which uterus didelfis was determined in three (0. 5 %) patients, unicornuate uterus in seven (1. 2 %), bicornuate uterus/septated uterus in 34 (5. 6 %) and arcuate uterus in seven (1. 2 %). Hydrosalpinx was determined in 17 (2. 8 %) patients and lack of peritoneal spill in five (0. 8 %) patients. Discussion: In the current study, HSG procedures were evaluated as abnormal at the rate of 23. 8 %. As HSG is inexpensive and easy to apply, {{it is one of the}} basic procedures in an infertility work-up. HSG indications should be defined more selectively to avoid the <b>unecessary</b> application of HSG and thereby increase the detection rate...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{aquaculture}} {{for marine}} species is gaining importance in todays industry. Over fishing {{of the natural}} recource has sadly meant {{that many of the}} higher predators halibut, turbot, seabass, sea bream and tuna are now financially suitable for the industry. This thesis covers a wide range of topics involving two of the most valuable marine species, namely the Atlantic halibut and European seabas, from broodstock to larval first-feeding. Broodstock husbandry and especially nutrition are often the last to receive attention. This study shows that careful management of the broodstock, firstly by the close timing of stripping, secondly enhancement of the broodstock diet with n- 3 and n- 6 HUFA can increase both fecundity and egg quality right up {{to the point where the}} larvae switch from endogenous to exogenous feeding. The implications for the industry for these two species are twofold. Firstly, The identification that halibut eggs can be fertilised within 6 hours of ovulation with no detrimental effects on fertilisation rates and subsequent egg performance means that eggs could be transported to specialist egg and larval rearing units. Thus the potential exists for the industry to be divided into separate units dealing with different stages of the life cycle much like the salmon industry. Secondly, the development of an artificial pelleted brood stock diet would mean that problems of consistency and quality and also the dangers of disease infection via the feed can be removed from broodstock management. The stage of first-feeding for halibut is still considered to be the main bottleneck in the production of this species. The current work has shown that small systems of 100 - 1 can be used to successfully rear halibut larvae. Although careful consideration must be made of the system design to ensure that predator (larvae) and prey (Artemia) remain homogeneously dispersed. Also, the need to use rotifers at first feed has been shown to be <b>unecessary.</b> However, nutrition of first-feeding larvae still requires the use of wild zooplankton to ensure successful pigmentation. Yet, Artemia supplied with commercial enrichments still perform adequately in terms of their overall growth...|$|E

Our objective is to identify factors determining the decrease in hospital stay after major thoracic surgery. METHODS: A two-phase retrospective study was conducted on analysis of medical records. In the first phase, data on length of hospital stay and related factors were collected from a consecutive series of 169 patients divided into group I (n= 81) -patients operated on between June 1990 and December 1995, and group II (n= 88) _patients operated on from January 1996 through May 2000.

RESULTS: Intensive care unit was <b>unecessary</b> for most patients in immediate post operative period. The mean hospital stay decreased from 7. 6 days (median 7) in group I to 5. 1 days (median 4) in group II (p< 0. 001). The more frequent utilization of epidural analgesia and less traumatic thoracothomy in group II reached statistic significance (p< 0. 001). In group III, the mean hospital stay was 4. 2 days (median 4), and there was a more efective use of epidural analgesia (75 %) and muscle- sparing thoracothomy (90 %). Eight thoracic surgeons answered the survey: the mean hospital stay varied from five to nine days and all patients were sent to intensive care or similar units. Only two surgeons utilize muscle-sparing thoracothomy. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that pain control and less traumatic surgical approach are important for faster functional recovery of patients. It suggests that the IC units may be used only for selected patients...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} devoted to the paramedic education systems in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, and to comparing the competences these professions have. The theoretical chapter is divided into two sections. The first part focuses on the paramedic education system in the Czech Republic. A brief description of the specialisation is followed by the possibilities of obtaining the qualifications of a paramedic. To illustrate these possibilities, the first stage of university education and its accredited subject A Paramedic Education Programme offered by the University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice serves as a model example. The competences of paramedics in the Czech Republic are based on the valid regulation of the Ministry of Health no. 55 / 2011 of the Collection of Laws on the activities of non-doctor health-care workers and other specialised personnel. This outline includes also a list of the possibilities of deployment of paramedics in the Czech Republic and their brief descriptions. This part is brought to a close with an account of the possibilities of further education and specialisation. The second part of the theoretical chapter concentrates on the education system for the ambulance service personnel in the Federal Republic of Germany. Individual subchapters describe the levels of non-doctor health-care workers and their activities in the ambulance service. In the German ambulance service, the most corresponding counterpart of the Czech paramedic is the paramedic assistant (to be replaced by emergency attendant due to the German legal regulation that came into force on January 1, 2014). In this section, the main attention {{is devoted to}} the education of paramedic assistants. The practical part of the bachelor thesis employs the method of qualitative research through structured interviews with open-ended questions. The sample respondents included men and women working with the ambulance service in České Budějovice and having the qualifications of a paramedic, and for the German part paramedic assistants from the ambulance crew in Passau. To answer the first research question Do the Czech paramedics have wider competences than the German ones? it was necessary to compare the legal regulations in both countries and the appropriate expert literature. The data thus obtained have been checked through the direct questioning of paramedics in both countries. The results show that in comparison with the German paramedic assistant, the Czech paramedic has a wider scope of activities in health-care, even outside the ambulance service. Czech paramedics can work at anaesthesiology & resuscitation departments, at accident & emergency departments or as emergency call operators. Unlike in Germany, all these possibilities are specified also in the law. The comparative analysis therefore shows that the Czech paramedic has overall wider competences than the German paramedic assistant, even though in the sphere of pre-hospital emergency care their competences are very similar, if not fully identical. The second research question was whether it would be beneficial for the emergency assistants in Germany to study their specialisation at university. The analysis of the structured interviews with emergency assistants resulted in the conclusion {{that they would not be}} in favour of such an arrangement. In their opinion a university education programme would mean an <b>unecessary</b> complication due to the higher financial costs of German university studies. Not all people interested in this specialisation could afford to study it. The respondents also pointed out that it would be impossible for the current health-care system to pay these university-educated specialists. They voiced some criticism of the present-day education system, nevertheless they hope that the long-overdue expected legislative changes will mean improvements of all the criticised issues...|$|E
40|$|Agder University College in Norway has marked 'religion, {{ethics and}} society' {{as one of}} its top {{priority}} subjects. It was therefore decided to supplement its professor of sociology of religion, Pål Repstad, with another professorship in the subject. This led to awarding Ole Riis the new professorship in 2005. Ole Riis came from Denmark, where he taught sociology of religion for several years at the University of Aarhus, and where he later contributed to establishing a full sociology programme at University of Aalborg, with an emphasis on methodology. The present book contains expanded and corrected manuscripts for a series of lectures held by Ole Riis. First and foremost, there is the opening lecture at AUC. It presents a programme for sociology of religion as a bridge-building discipline, interconnecting humanistic studies of religion and theology with social sciences. The lecture points at the need for developing new theories for subjects such as religious emotions and the need for an enhanced awareness of the development of methods in the gap between traditional quantitative and qualitative methods. These issues are brought further in two of the following manuscripts. One major chapter presents a theoretical framework for analyzing religious emotions in a social context. The conceptual scheme is based on a dialectical relationship between the social structure and the individual. This relationship is first presented as a juxtaposition between processes of an externalization of religiously based emotions and an internalization of social standards for proper religious emotions. This is supplemented by a juxtaposition of processes of objectification of religious emotions in art or rituals, and of subjectification where the emotions are experienced by a person as deep and genuine. It is followed by a chapter which applies a field theory approach to the church. The core example is the Danish state-supported Protestant church. A field theory stresses the potential tensions between a set of positions, characterized by their special interests and resources. Thereby, it is posible to identify congruent or conflicting patterns of interest between types of religious employees and lay members of the church. This pattern of interests is related to the context of a late modern society. It is argued that the state church has been dominated by interest positions which are rooted in a pre-modern society. This helps to explain the support of the state church from different parts of society and its status in late modern Denmark. The next chapter is based on a presentation of findings from a major research project on state churches and religious pluralism for a research seminar organized by the Nordic Council. The project was supported by the Nordic Council under the aegis of 'The Nordic countries and Europe', and it was affiliated with an international survey project, 'Religious and Moral Pluralism in Europe'. The chapter presents some of the major findings of the survey study relating to religious and ethnic pluralism. It ties these findings to present discussions about the challenges which immigration from non-Christian cultures have raised in relation to religious toleration in the Nordic countries. The final chapter discusses new methodological options for the social sciences. It follows up on Ole Riis' book 'Metoder på tværs' (or 'Criss-crossing methods'). It criticized the paradigmatic split between qualitative and quantitative methods, and it demonstrated that this distinction is scientifically <b>unecessary</b> and unfruitful. This led to an outline of an integrated approach based on a 'collective intellectual' perspective. The chapter of the present book furthers this approach by discussing some concrete methodological possibilities, such as logistic regression analysis, small-n comparisons, correspondance analysis, and simulation models. It is hereby indicated that the book is not to be read as a monograph. It is a series of pointers for further research, published by the author in the hope that young scholars may find some inspiration from it - for their own research and for their own purposes...|$|E
