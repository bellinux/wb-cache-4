40|$|A seven-hole flow-angularity {{pressure}} probe {{was used}} to assess the effectiveness of vortex unwinding in a turbulent boundary layer. The vortex center moved in the spanwise and vertical direction with increasing longitudinal distance. Initially, the vortex moved rapidly; it achieved 60 percent of its total 41 mm spanwise travel before it had completed half of its travel in the longitudinal direction. The flow was studied behind the single vortex combined with the most successful <b>unwinder.</b> The <b>unwinder</b> was found to be very effective in reducing the amount of secondary flow in the boundary layer...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} is to control a web transport system with winder and <b>unwinder</b> for elastic material. A physical mod-eling of this plant is made based on the general laws of physics. For this type of controlproblem, it is extremely important {{to prevent the occurrence}} of web break or fold by decoupling the web tension and the web velocity. Due to the wide-range variation of the radius and inertia of the rollers the system dynamics change considerably during the winding/unwinding process The system is composed of five paper rollers and a tensioning roller. A control structure is suggested for this system. This control is deduced from an Energetic Macroscopic Representation of the system. Neither robust control strategy nor mechanical emulation is required, but this control needs a large number of controllers...|$|E

40|$|Article history: The {{dynamics}} of the winder roller of a roll-to-roll printing system for printed electronics is a time-varying system because of the variation of the winder roller radius owing to rewinding or unwinding of the web. Therefore, an adaptive control method considering the time-variant characteristics is required for precise tension control. In this study, the variable PID gain method {{is applied to the}} actual roll-to-roll system and verified by experiments for <b>unwinder</b> tension control. The required value of the winder roller radius for the application of the variable PID gain is estimated from the measurement of the winder tension and winder motor torque. The simulation results as well as experimental results show that the fixed PID gain control cannot stabilize the tension of the winder roller with varying winder roller radius. On the other hand, the variable PID gain method can control the tension of the winder roller regardless of the winder roller radius...|$|E
40|$|The plantisaweb {{transport}} system with winder and <b>unwinder.</b> Due to a wide-range {{variation of the}} radius and inertia of the rollers the system dynamics change considerably. Two di#erent control strategies for web tension and linear transport velocity are presented. The #rst is an H 1 robust control strategy with varying gains based on a particularity of the plant. The second is an LPV control strategy with smooth scheduling of controllers synthesized for di#erent operating points. The quadratic stability and the quadratic performance of the closed loop system are analyzed. The LPV control strategy gives better results on an experimental setup, for {{the rejection of the}} disturbances introduced byvelocityvariations. 1 Introduction The systems transporting paper, metal, polymers or textile are very common in the industry. The main goal is to increase as much as possible the web transport velocity while controlling the tension of the web. The main concern is the coupling existing between web ve [...] ...|$|E
40|$|SummaryG-quadruplex (G 4) DNA {{structures}} are extremely stable four-stranded secondary structures {{held together by}} noncanonical G-G base pairs. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation {{was used to determine}} the in vivo binding sites of the multifunctional Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif 1 DNA helicase, a potent <b>unwinder</b> of G 4 structures in vitro. G 4 motifs were a significant subset of the high-confidence Pif 1 -binding sites. Replication slowed in the vicinity of these motifs, and they were prone to breakage in Pif 1 -deficient cells, whereas non-G 4 Pif 1 -binding sites did not show this behavior. Introducing many copies of G 4 motifs caused slow growth in replication-stressed Pif 1 -deficient cells, which was relieved by spontaneous mutations that eliminated their ability to form G 4 structures, bind Pif 1, slow DNA replication, and stimulate DNA breakage. These data suggest that G 4 structures form in vivo and that they are resolved by Pif 1 to prevent replication fork stalling and DNA breakage...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new {{approach}} for the compensation of unknown periodic disturbances {{by means of a}} neural network is presented. The neural controller supports the conventional controller by suppressing periodic disturbances. This is done by online learning in order to adapt to different operating conditions and to time varying unknown disturbances. The neural network learns an optimal compensation signal, such that the effect of the disturbance becomes zero in the considered output signal. With this method, {{there is no need to}} redesign existing control loops. Exemplified by the compensation of eccentricities of the <b>unwinder</b> of a continuous processing plant, the neural controller is explained and simulation results are shown. An extension to the basic method is to consider an additional input dimension in the neural network, which represents the current operating point. The information about the optimal compensation signal of a specific operating point is stored in the network weights of a multidimensional Radial Basis Function Network. For pre-trained operation ranges, this guarantees an optimal compensation result even if the operating point changes. The main benefit of the presented method in industrial applications is the capability to augment the production speed and to improve the product quality, by reducing tension force oscillations caused by eccentricities of rollers or unwinders...|$|E
40|$|Roll-to-Roll (R 2 R) {{systems have}} been widely used in the {{traditional}} paper printing and packaging industry. In addition, Roll-to-Roll systems are also considered as a cost effective mass production solution for printed electronics, such as RFID and Solar cells in the recent years [1]. In a Roll-to-Roll system, web material often experiences lateral motion during the transportation to processes [1]. This project presents the lateral dynamics control system integration using centred pivoted displacement guide for Roll-to-Roll application. An initial literature review of the project is carried out with supporting theory and web handling mechanism. The complete system design consists of four units, namely <b>unwinder</b> unit, load cell unit, guide unit and rewinder unit. In this project, two microcontrollers are proposed to control the four units with additional instrumentation and signal conditioning between sensors/actuators, and the controller. The Guide system dynamics are simulated using first order single degree-of-freedom oscillator model controlled with classical PID servo designs. Finally, the complete system is tested with different disturbances input to the system. The system lateral response is compared with and without the guide system. Results are shown to have reduced the lateral motion when media transport speeds are at 20 m/min, 40 m/min and 60 m/min...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} helical {{unwinding}} assay for reversibly binding DNA ligands that uses closed circular DNA, topoisomerase I (Topo I), and two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. Serially diluted Topo I relaxation reactions at constant DNA/ligand ratio are performed, {{and the resulting}} apparent unwinding of the closed circular DNA {{is used to calculate}} both ligand unwinding angle (φ) and intrinsic association constant (Ka). Mathematical treatment of apparent unwinding is formally analogous to that of apparent extinction coefficient data for optical binding titrations. Extrapolation to infinite DNA concentration yields the true unwinding angle of a given ligand and its association constant under Topo I relaxation conditions. Thus this assay delivers simultaneous structural and thermodynamic information describing the ligand–DNA complex. The utility of this assay has been demonstrated by using calichearubicin B (CRB), a synthetic hybrid molecule containing the anthraquinone chromophore of (DA) and the carbohydrate domain of calicheamicin γ 1 I. The unwinding angle for CRB calculated by this method is − 5. 3 ± 0. 5 °. Its Ka value is 0. 20 × 106 M− 1. For comparison, the unwinding angles of ethidium bromide and DA have been independently calculated, and the results are in agreement with canonical values for these compounds. Although a stronger binder to selected sites, CRB is a less potent <b>unwinder</b> than its parent compound DA. The assay requires only small amounts of ligand and offers an attractive option for analysis of DNA binding by synthetic and natural compounds...|$|E
30|$|Several factors {{shape the}} tension control design to be challenging, which include {{significant}} parameter variations and disturbances. Small {{variations in the}} change of velocity of the transport rollers can cause significant variations in tension. On the other hand, we used different shapes of mandrels for maintaining the line speed in acceleration or deceleration states. Because of the coupling between the tension and the line speed, {{it is difficult to}} maintain the tension at a desired value. Researchers have investigated considerably for acquiring better control result. Lee et al. [2] used a magneto rheological brake to provide back tension to prevent frequent part changes and fatal malfunction for a tension control system, and a PID controller was designed, and test results showed the feasibility with satisfying the time constant and the allowable error. Nishida et al. [3] divided the transport system into several subsystems and a self-tuning PI controller with an estimator based on a novel adaptive particle swarm optimization method was constructed to solve the strong coupling between the velocity and tension of the web. A self-tuning PID controller to control the tension for tape winding of composites was designed and the constant extension ratio is guaranteed. To reduce the time required for the stabilization of the tension, a faststabilization method [4] for web tension is proposed. The model of dancer system and stabilization of web tension in drying process are established, and the variation of tension is used as a reference value for the tension stabilization. The integration of load cells and active dancer system for printed electronics applications was used to improve the accuracy of web tension, and self-adapting neural network control was proposed to reduce tension spikes due to the change in roll diameter of winder and <b>unwinder</b> rolls. Wu et al. [5] developed a tension detection and control mechanism and analyzed the main causes of wire tension variation, and then a PI algorithm was proposed to reduce tension variation. An accurate dynamic model for the unwind roll by considering the time variation of the roll inertia and radius was developed, and a decentralized controller for computing the equilibrium inputs for each driven roller was proposed [6]. A sliding mode control with guaranteed cost technique [7] was applied for reducing the system uncertainties. The simulation results showed that the proposed method had good robustness and quick response time. Compensation method [8] by calculating the torque of a driven loop lifter was developed to control the tension and thickness of hot-rolled strip. For the control strategy, several control methods have been proposed including disturbance rejection control [9 – 12], neuro-fuzzy control [13 – 16], and H∞ control [17 – 19]. Choi et al. [20] conducted a survey on various types of control algorithms by investigating their strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrated some areas of potential future development.|$|E
