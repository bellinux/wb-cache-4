40|$|Respirable dust {{exposure}} {{has long been}} known to be a serious health threat to workers in many industries. In coal mining, overexposure to respirable coal mine dust can lead to coal workers pneumoconiosis (CWP). CWP is a lung disease that can be disabling and fatal in its most severe form. In addition, miners can be exposed to high levels of respirable silica dust, which can cause silicosis, another disabling and/or fatal lung disease. Once contracted, there is no cure for CWP or silicosis. The goal, therefore, is to limit worker exposure to respirable dust to prevent development of these diseases. The passage of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 established respirable {{dust exposure}} limits, dust sampling requirements for inspectors and mine operators, a voluntary x-ray surveillance program to identify CWP in underground coal miners, and a benefits program to provide compensation to affected workers and their families.

"Continuous miner operator" is the most frequently listed occupation on death certificates that record silicosis as the cause of death. In light of the ongoing severity of these lung diseases in coal mining, this handbook was developed to identify available engineering controls that can help the industry reduce worker exposure to respirable coal and silica dust. The controls discussed in this handbook range from long-utilized controls that have developed into industry standards to newer controls that are still being optimized. The intent was to identify the best practices that are available to control respirable dust levels in underground and surface coal mining operations. This handbook provides general information on the control technologies along with extensive references. In some cases, the full reference(s) will need to be consulted to gain in-depth information on the testing or implementation of the control of interest. The handbook is divided into five chapters. Chapter 1 discusses the health effects of exposure to respirable coal and silica dust. Chapter 2 discusses dust sampling instruments and sampling methods. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 focus on dust control technologies for longwall mining, continuous mining, and surface mining, respectively. Finally, it must be stressed that after control technologies are implemented, the ultimate success of ongoing protection for workers depends on continued maintenance of these controls.

The first portion of the study examined various factors associated with roof and rib fall injuries and reportable roof fall noninjuries that occurred during 1995 - 98. The study found that the room-and-pillar mining method has twice the groundfall incident rate than the longwall method. Mine locations with high groundfall rates seem to correlate to regions where there is a higher concentration of problematic coalbeds. For example, the Illinois Basin has very high groundfall rates, which {{can be traced back to}} several key coalbeds-Kentucky No. 13, Herrin/No. 6 /Kentucky No. 11, and Springfield No. 5 /Kentucky No. 9. High rib fall rates were found in mines located in thick seams. Groundfall rates were found to be 30 % to 40 % higher during the months of July through September, possibly due to high humidity that may cause the shale mine roof to deteriorate. The second part of the study examined the root causes of failure by reviewing all groundfall fatality reports for 1996 - 99. Primary and secondary hazard factors were assigned to each groundfall incident. The primaryf actors resulting in these groundfall fatalities were pillar extraction, traveling under unsupported roof, skin failure, construction, longwall faces, intersections, and geologic discontinuities. Defining prominent ground control incident trends and hazards will identify areas where additional study is needed and where innovative solutions need to be developed to reduce these severe occupational hazards...|$|R
40|$|The {{current trends}} towards {{increased}} coal production from seams at greater depth {{has led to}} increased demands being placed on the methane drainage and mine ventilation systems. This study has been directed towards the development of computer models to simulate and analyse the gas flows in methane drainage ranges and the airflow and pressure distribution in mine ventilation networks. The {{first part of this}} thesis describes the conventional techniques of methane drainage currently employed and the mathematical approach used to model gas flow in the methane drainage range. It also discusses how, when combined with measured underground data, predicted results can be used to assess the performance of the range. Subsequent analysis techniques will suggest measures that can be undertaken to optimise this performance and assess the effect of selective network reconfiguration. The second part of the thesis includes a discussion of the increasing application of booster fans in <b>U.</b> K. <b>underground</b> coal mines and a critical analysis of the mathematical methods used to model airflow and pressure distribution in mine ventilation networks. One particular method was adopted in a simulation model used to analyse networks with booster fans and specified face airflows. Both simulation models developed have been used to analyse representative underground methane drainage ranges and mine ventilation networks. The thesis concludes that the accuracy of the methane drainage models can only be guaranteed when developed in conjunction with suitable measured data. The mine ventilation model requires user guidance through the solution and analysis procedure. Results are presented in a simple graphical manner and this approach, rather than the 'black box' non interactive approach, is to be favoured in the analysis of mine ventilation networks...|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} use of diesel-powered equipment in mines makes the exposure to diesel aerosols a serious occupational issue. The exposure metric currently used in <b>U.</b> S. <b>underground</b> noncoal mines {{is based on the}} measurement of total carbon (TC) and elemental carbon (EC) mass concentration in the air. Recent toxicological evidence suggests that the measurement of mass concentration is not sufficient to correlate ultrafine aerosol exposure with health effects. This urges the evaluation of alternative measurements. In this study, the current exposure metric and two additional metrics, the surface area and the total number concentration, were evaluated by conducting simultaneous measurements of diesel ultrafine aerosols in a laboratory setting. The results showed that the surface area and total number concentration of the particles per unit of mass varied substantially with the engine operating condition. The specific surface area (SSA) and specific number concentration (SNC) normalized with TC varied two and five times, respectively. This implies that miners, whose exposure is measured only as TC, might be exposed to an unknown variable number concentration of diesel particles and commensurate particle surface area. Taken separately, mass, surface area, and number concentration did not completely characterize the aerosols. A comprehensive assessment of diesel aerosol exposure should include all of these elements, but the use of laboratory instruments in underground mines is generally impracticable. The article proposes a new approach to solve this problem. Using SSA and SNC calculated from field-type measurements, the evaluation of additional physical properties can be obtained by using the proposed approach.

40|$|In {{the last}} 6 years, seven explosions of methane and/or coal dust {{occurred}} within worked-out, sealed areas (GOBS) of <b>underground</b> <b>U.</b> S. coal mines. These explosions, {{believed to have}} been started by lightning, destroyed many mine seals and caused much damage external to the sealed area. Three of these gob gas explosions occurred in one mine in Alabama over a 3 -year period. Fortunately, the explosion forces and the toxic gases that vented from the sealed gob area did not cause fatalities or injuries, but they destroyed several large seals. If miners had been inspecting or working near these areas, the potential for serious injury and/or death would have been high. The United Mine Workers of America and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) requested that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) help identify the mechanisms for lightning penetration into the gob and recommend ways to reduce the probability of occurrence of future explosions from such lightning penetrations into sealed areas of underground coal mines.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is {{conducting}} radioanalytical developmental programs {{with the goal}} of providing near-real-time analysis technology for airborne signature radionuclides which are indicative of a nuclear weapons test in any of the earth`s environments. If a test were conducted in the atmosphere or above the atmosphere, then the full spectrum of fission and activation products, together with residues from the device would be dispersed in the atmosphere. However, if a nuclear test were conducted underground or under water, the emission could range from a major to a very minor vent, and the material released would likely consist mainly of noble gas radionuclides and the radioiodines. Since many of the noble gases decay to form particulate radionuclides, these may serve as the more sensitive signatures. For example, Ba- 140 is a daughter of Xe- 140 (13. 6 s), and Cs- 137 is a daughter of Xe- 137 (3. 82 min). Both of these have been observed in large amounts relative to other fission products in dynamic venting of <b>U.</b> S. <b>underground</b> nuclear detonations. Large amounts of radionuclides are produced from even a comparatively small nuclear detonation. For example, a 10 -KT fission device will produce approximately a megacurie of Ba- 140 and of several other radionuclides with half-lives of days to weeks. If such a device were detonated in the atmosphere at midlatitude, it would easily be observable at downwind monitoring sites during its first and subsequent circumnavigations of the earth. Efficient and practical methods for the near-real-time analysis of both particulate and gaseous radionuclides are important to an effective monitoring and attribution program in support of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT); methods for this purpose are being pursued...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 40 years, cavern storage of LPG's, petrochemicals, such as {{ethylene}} and propylene, and {{other petroleum products}} has increased dramatically. In 1991, the Gas Processors Association (GPA) lists the total <b>U.</b> S. <b>underground</b> storage capacity for LPG's and related products of approximately 519 million barrels (82. 5 million cubic meters) in 1, 122 separate caverns. Of this total, 70 are hard rock caverns and the remaining 1, 052 are caverns in salt deposits. However, along the eastern seaboard of the U. S. and the Pacific northwest, salt deposits are not available and therefore, storage in hard rocks is required. Limited demand and high cost has prevented the construction of hard rock caverns {{in this country for}} a number of years. The storage of natural gas in mined caverns may prove technically feasible if the geology of the targeted market area is suitable; and economically feasible if the cost and convenience of service is competitive with alternative available storage methods for peak supply requirements. Competing methods include LNG facilities and remote underground storage combined with pipeline transportation to the area. It is believed that mined cavern storage can provide the advantages of high delivery rates and multiple fill withdrawal cycles in areas where salt cavern storage is not possible. In this research project, PB-KBB merged advanced mining technologies and gas refrigeration techniques to develop conceptual designs and cost estimates to demonstrate the commercialization potential of the storage of refrigerated natural gas in hard rock caverns. DOE has identified five regions, that have not had favorable geological conditions for underground storage development: New England, Mid-Atlantic (NY/NJ), South Atlantic (DL/MD/VA), South Atlantic (NC/SC/GA), and the Pacific Northwest (WA/OR). PB-KBB reviewed published literature and in-house databases of the geology of these regions to determine suitability of hard rock formations for siting storage caverns, and gas market area storage needs of these regions...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundCoal plays {{a crucial}} role in the U. S. economy yet {{underground}} coal mining continues to be one of the most dangerous occupations in the country. In addition, there are large variations in both profitability and the incidence of occupational injuries across mines. ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to examine the association between profitability and the incidence rate of occupational injuries in <b>U.</b> S. <b>underground</b> coal mines between 1992 and 2008. Data and methodWe used mine-specific data on annual hours worked, geographic location, and the number of occupational injuries suffered annually from the employment and accident/injury databases of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, and mine-specific data on annual revenue from coal sales, mine age, workforce union status, and mining method from the U. S. Energy Information Administration. A total of 5669 mine-year observations (number of mines 32 Ì† 014 number of years) were included in our analysis. We used a negative binomial random effects model that was appropriate for analyzing panel (combined time-series and cross-sectional) injury data that were non-negative and discrete. The dependent variable, occupational injury, was measured in three different and non-mutually exclusive ways: all reported fatal and nonfatal injuries, reported nonfatal injuries with lost workdays, and the 22 Ì† 0 ac 2 Ì†dcmost serious 22 Ì† 0 ac 2 Ì† 122 (i. e. sum of fatal and serious nonfatal) injuries reported. The total number of hours worked in each mine and year examined was used as an exposure variable. Profitability, the main explanatory variable, was approximated by revenue per hour worked. Our model included mine age, workforce union status, mining method, and geographic location as additional control variables. ResultsAfter controlling for other variables, a 10...|$|R
