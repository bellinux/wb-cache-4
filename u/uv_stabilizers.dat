Experiments were conducted based on a D-optimal mixture design and analyzed using response surface methodology. Analysis of variance revealed that compositions including rPP, RWF, maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP), and ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>stabilizer</b> significantly affected hardness property. Contour plots of the response surface demonstrated that an increase of RWF content steadily enhanced hardness value, but hardness property sharply decreased with an increase of rPP loading.

40|$|Wood plastic {{composites}} (WPCs) {{are increasingly}} being utilized these days due to their excellent mechanical properties and low maintenance cost. Despite these advantages, poor UV resistance and low impact strength are drawbacks. To overcome these shortcomings, coextrusion technology has recently been applied {{in the production of}} WPCs and it has been showing good results. However, further research on the combination of different functional enhancements is still needed. This study, therefore, manufactured polypropylene (PP) composites filled with <b>UV</b> <b>stabilizer</b> and inorganic fillers (i. e., nano-CaCO 3 and talc) and then investigated the influence of weathering on the mechanical and morphological properties of the filled composites as a function of filler type and content. <b>UV</b> <b>stabilizer</b> effectively protected the filled composites from UV-induced photodegradation.
