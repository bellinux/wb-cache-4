5000|$|The cyclic multiverse {{is saying}} that {{collisions}} between braneworlds can manifest as big bang - like beginnings, yielding <b>universes</b> <b>that</b> are parallel in time.|$|R
5|$|Dark {{matter is}} the matter in the <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> cannot be seen. Because of the {{gravitational}} effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the matter in the universe is dark matter. The spatial distribution of dark matter in the universe is largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists answer to this question.|$|E
5|$|Heterotic M-theory {{has been}} used to {{construct}} models of brane cosmology in which the observable universe is thought to exist on a brane in a higher dimensional ambient space. It has also spawned alternative theories of the early <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> do not rely on the theory of cosmic inflation.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of the God of War video game franchise belong to a fictional <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> was, originally, loosely based on Greek mythology—an eighth installment is in development and will be loosely based on Norse mythology. As such, the series features a range of traditional figures, including Olympian Gods, Titans, and heroes. A number of original characters have also been created to supplement storylines.|$|E
50|$|The DC {{animated}} universe (DCAU) has {{depicted the}} Multiverse many times. Several characters {{from the main}} DCAU have visited parallel <b>universes</b> <b>that</b> were similar to the DCAU.|$|R
25|$|Several set theorists {{followed}} this approach and actively searched for axioms {{that may be}} considered as true for heuristic reasons and that would decide the continuum hypothesis. Many large cardinal axioms were studied, but the hypothesis always remained independent from them. Other types of axioms were considered, {{but none of them}} has reached consensus on the continuum hypothesis yet. Recent work by Hamkins proposes a more flexible alternative: a set-theoretic multiverse allowing free passage between set-theoretic <b>universes</b> <b>that</b> satisfy the continuum hypothesis and other <b>universes</b> <b>that</b> do not.|$|R
25|$|Some {{of these}} stories or films violate {{fundamental}} principles of causality and relativity, since the information-theoretic structure of the path space of multiple <b>universes</b> (<b>that</b> is, information flow between different paths) is very likely complex.|$|R
5|$|Distant {{regions of}} space {{are assumed to}} exist and {{to be part of}} reality as much as we are, even though we can never {{interact}} with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the <b>Universe</b> <b>that</b> is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} {{general theory of}} {{relativity}} to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E
5|$|In Lansdale, Pennsylvania, {{a highway}} {{construction}} worker hears an odd noise in a cornfield, and is pulled down into an underground tunnel by a mysterious, unidentified creature. Using a lighter for sight, {{he sees the}} remains of other creatures, and is then eaten by the creature off screen. Meanwhile, Walter (John Noble) investigates Olivia's (Anna Torv) car crash from the previous episode. He believes she traveled to a parallel <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> is similar to theirs, but she still cannot remember with whom she met with, or why.|$|E

50|$|In most {{small-scale}} fictional universes, general {{properties and}} timeline events {{fit into a}} consistently organized continuity. However, {{in the case of}} <b>universes</b> <b>that</b> are rewritten or revised by different writers, editors or producers, this continuity may be violated, by accident or by design.|$|R
5|$|Negative {{pressure}} {{is believed to}} be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.|$|E
5|$|The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media {{franchise}} {{and shared}} <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> {{is centered on}} a series of superhero films, independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise has expanded to include comic books, short films, television series, and digital series. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. Phil Coulson, portrayed by Clark Gregg, is an original character to the MCU and the only character to appear across all the different media of the MCU.|$|E
5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public about the effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the <b>Universe,</b> <b>that</b> such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E
50|$|In narrative, pocket universes are fictional {{naturally}} or artificially-created <b>universes</b> <b>that</b> {{exist within}} the bounds of another universe. The term pocket universe is derived from its illustration in the actual universe where it is usually portrayed as an orb which would fit in a pocket.|$|R

5|$|The core {{concept of}} general-relativistic {{model-building}} {{is that of}} a solution of Einstein's equations. Given both Einstein's equations and suitable equations for the properties of matter, such a solution consists of a specific semi-Riemannian manifold (usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates), and specific matter fields defined on that manifold. Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein's equations, so in particular, the matter's energy–momentum tensor must be divergence-free. The matter must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties. In short, such a solution is a model <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present.|$|E
5|$|The first non-visual {{study of}} galaxies, {{particularly}} active galaxies, was made using radio frequencies. The Earth's atmosphere is nearly transparent to radio between 5MHz and 30GHz. (The ionosphere blocks signals below this range.) Large radio interferometers {{have been used}} to map the active jets emitted from active nuclei. Radio telescopes {{can also be used to}} observe neutral hydrogen (via 21cm radiation), including, potentially, the non-ionized matter in the early <b>Universe</b> <b>that</b> later collapsed to form galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The {{observable}} Universe is isotropic on scales significantly {{larger than}} superclusters, {{meaning that the}} statistical properties of the Universe are the same in all directions as observed from Earth. The Universe is bathed in highly isotropic microwave radiation that corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly 2.72548 kelvin. The hypothesis that the large-scale Universe is homogeneous and isotropic {{is known as the}} cosmological principle. A <b>Universe</b> <b>that</b> is both homogeneous and isotropic looks the same from all vantage points and has no center.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem with}} the {{animation}} from the producers' point-of-view was {{that it did not}} exhibit a distinct style envisioned for the show. At the time {{there were only a few}} choices for animation style. Usually, they would either follow the style of Disney, Warner Bros., or Hanna-Barbera. Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons had a <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> was bendy and the characters seemed to be made of rubber. The producers wanted a realistic environment in which the characters and objects could not do anything that was not possible in the real world. One example with the early animation being cartoonish was that the doors behaved liked rubber when slammed. The style of Hanna-Barbera featured the use of cartoon sounds, which they did not want either.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are nonlinear partial {{differential equations}} and, as such, difficult to solve exactly. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} exact solutions are known, although only a few have direct physical applications. The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the Schwarzschild solution, the Reissner–Nordström solution and the Kerr metric, each corresponding to {{a certain type of}} black hole in an otherwise empty universe, and the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker and de Sitter universes, each describing an expanding cosmos. Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the Gödel universe (which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes), the Taub-NUT solution (a model <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> is homogeneous, but anisotropic), and anti-de Sitter space (which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the Maldacena conjecture).|$|E
5|$|Later, it was {{announced}} that should a sequel or reboot not start filming by October 10, 2012, the rights to the Daredevil franchise would revert from Fox back to Marvel. In early August 2012, Fox scrambled to find a replacement for David Slade, who dropped out of the director's chair due to scheduling conflicts. The studio briefly met with Joe Carnahan, for the job—however, Carnahan said on Twitter that his pitch, described as a hard-boiled '70s thriller, had gone up in smoke. Several sources commented that Fox had given up on the reboot, and were prepared to let the rights revert to Marvel and their parent company, The Walt Disney Company. On April 23, 2013, Kevin Feige confirmed that the rights for Daredevil returned to Marvel Studios and Disney, opening the possibility of including the character into the Marvel Cinematic <b>Universe.</b> <b>That</b> speculation was confirmed with the announcement of an original Netflix Daredevil television series, which premiered on the streaming service in April 2015, with English actor Charlie Cox in the title role.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{competing}} hypotheses about the ultimate {{fate of the}} Universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible.
