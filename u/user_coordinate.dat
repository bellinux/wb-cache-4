50|$|The above code {{defines a}} new {{function}} which generates an AutoCAD point object {{at a given}} point, with a single-line text object displaying the X and Y coordinates beside it. The name of the function includes a special prefix 'c:', which causes AutoCAD to recognize the function as a regular command. The user, upon typing 'pointlabel' at the AutoCAD command line, would be prompted to pick a point, either by typing the X and Y coordinates, or clicking a location in the drawing. The function would then place a marker at that point, and create a single-line text object next to it, containing the X and Y coordinates of the point expressed relative to the active <b>User</b> <b>Coordinate</b> System (UCS). The function requires no parameters, and contains one Local variable ('pnt').|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a technique for augmenting {{the process of}} 3 D direct manipulation by automaticallyfind-ing an effective placement for the virtual camera. Many of the best techniques for direct manipulation of 3 D ge-ometric objects {{are sensitive to the}} angle of view, and can thus require that the <b>user</b> <b>coordinate</b> the placement of the viewpoint during the manipulation process. In some cases, this process can be automated. This means that the system can automatically avoid degenerate sit-uations in which translations and rotations are difficult to perform. The system can also select viewpoints and viewing angles which make the object being manipu-lated visible, ensuring that it is not obstructed by other objects...|$|E
30|$|Interconnections and memories. The OP {{architecture}} {{is based on}} five concurrent communication buses to face bandwidth requirements. The first bus is 32 bits wide; it {{is connected to the}} local memory. The size of the memory is flexible according to application requirements (e.g., 5 objects with 20 points and 10 polygons each and N = 16 bits requires 39 Kbits). Moreover, the bus controller provides 1 × 32, 2 × 16, or 4 × 8 bits accesses. This flexibility is intensively used to concurrently transfer 16 and 8 bits data. The local memory is depicted in Figure 10, and it is organized in five regions. The first one contains common data including ambient light direction, number of objects, and numbers of polygons. The second region contains point positions and light values, the static part stores initial point positions, and the dynamic part is used for updated positions in the <b>user</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. The third region contains specification of polygons as a list of point addresses. The fourth region stores the specification of objects as a list of polygon addresses; it also includes some specific coefficients for the object light modeling. Finally, the last region is a buffer used for temporary data. The second bus is 16 bits wide and connected to the register file that can be accessed simultaneously with processing unit registers. The register file length is 16, and it is used for the storage of temporary data produced and reused during processing. The third bus is the access to the Y-buffer, which is interfaced through a specific module designed to optimize the test of pixel depths. It works as follows: during the execution of the fourth stage of the processing flow (polygon shape test, color increments), the Y values of polygons are transferred to the Y-buffer interface that sends back a notification if the tested polygon is hidden by closer ones. In such a case, the current polygon processing is interrupted and a jump is executed to the next polygon processing. Finally, the fourth connection is a RGB bus (24 bits pixel values), which is provided to access the video buffer.|$|E

One tracking method is trilateration, whereby the distance (time delay) to three or more surrounding cell phone towers is measured. Another tracking method monitors the exact <b>user</b> <b>coordinates</b> determined by a GPS receiver inside the phone. GPS-equipped cellphones began appearing in 2004, and by 2011, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission required that all new cellular phones be able to pinpoint location to within 50 feet.|$|R
40|$|Improved {{accuracy}} and reliability of the real-time <b>user</b> <b>coordinates</b> is expected if GNSS data is processed using the network-RTK technique. Some implementations of conventional network-RTK, e. g. Virtual Reference Station (VRS) techniques, require bi-directional communications via GSM/GPRS since the network server transmits network-corrections to a user, while the user receiver is required to transmit its (approximate) coordinate information to the server. The data transmission from the user is {{kept to a minimum}} because the server needs the <b>user’s</b> <b>coordinate</b> information only for “initialization ” or “handover”. On the other hand, a server-based network-RTK requires raw measurements from the rover/user receiver in order to compute the rover’s coordinates. There are several commercially available network-RTK systems, however server-based techniques are relatively new in GNSS surveying. In GNSS geodesy, server-based network processing has always been the norm, though rarely in real-time. With the move of the IGS towards a “real-time future”, the distinctions between server-based network-RTK implementations for survey users and for geodesy will be blurred. This paper describes a server-based network-RTK design that uses distributed servers to compute a rover’s coordinates in the required reference system by taking advantage o...|$|R

30|$|Due to the {{significant}} computation cost {{involved in the}} previously mentioned approaches, the researchers begin {{to pay more attention}} to the machine learning approach (e.g., the artificial neural network [13, 14], support vector machine [15], and fuzzy logic [16, 17]) to realize the fingerprint positioning. The most important advantage of the machine learning approach is about the real-time ability of inferring the <b>user's</b> <b>coordinates</b> in the on-line phase. However, most of the current machine learning positioning systems is designed for a small-scale area (e.g., approximately 600  m 2 [18]), and meanwhile, the positioning accuracy will significantly rely on the training process in the off-line phase.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} the following question- how should secondary <b>users</b> <b>coordinate</b> {{with each other}} to determine which channels to sense and potentially access in a cognitive radio network? If users may have a potentially different valuation of each channel and don’t know of each other’s valuations, then it is unclear whether there may be some benefit to explicitly exchanging this information, albeit at some cost, in order to minimize their chances of picking the same channel. We formulate and analyze a relevant 2 -player 2 -channel game and quantify how the cost of gathering the information affects the optimal number of rounds of negotiation. I...|$|R

A theoretical range is computed from the satellite ephemeris transmitted in the data message and the <b>user's</b> <b>coordinates.</b> Results of <b>user</b> offset from GPS time are obtained by differencing the measured and theoretical ranges and applying calibration corrections.

40|$|In {{satellite}} navigation systems (SNS) the <b>user?s</b> and satellites? <b>coordinates</b> {{and the difference}} between the satellite and the user clocks are connected by the system of nonlinear equations of pseudo-distances between satellites and the user. The usage of these equations in calculations is not convenient. Therefore, for calculation of the <b>user?s</b> <b>coordinates</b> {{and the difference between}} clocks in SNS the linearized by Taylor series expansion and rejection of members of the second order of smallness equations are used. Thus the calculation of these variables is carried out by iterations. By algebraic manipulations it is possible to transform the system of nonlinear equations of pseudo-distances between satellites and the user into a system of linear equations about the <b>coordinates</b> of the <b>user</b> and the difference between the satellites? and the user?s clocks. Application of the method of iteration is not required. Therefore, the application of such a system of linear equations will reduce the number and the count of these variables. ?????????? ??????? ???????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ??????? ??????? ????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ???????? ???????? ?????? ????? ???????? ? ???????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ????????...|$|R
