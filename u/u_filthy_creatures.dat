60|$|THE FEMALE FIGURE. You {{just say}} that again if you dare, you <b>filthy</b> <b>creature.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The princess went to {{castle and}} got {{work in the}} scullery. One day, she was told to carry water to the prince for bathing. The prince, not wanting to use water from such a <b>filthy</b> <b>creature,</b> threw it on her. Later, the princess went to the rock and asked to be magnificently dressed in copper. She went to a church, where the prince {{fell in love with}} her at once. She told him she came from Bath and used a charm to keep him from {{following}} her, but he had caught one of her gloves.|$|R
60|$|None {{would have}} {{recognized}} in the <b>filthy,</b> emaciated <b>creature,</b> covered by a single garment of small skins, the immaculate Monsieur Thuran the party had last seen upon {{the deck of the}} LADY ALICE.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, here's a <b>filthy</b> mean <b>creature</b> {{to sit on}} a throne. If I {{had known}} as much of him before as I know to-day, I don't doubt I should have given cause to be where I am now." [...] And then on a sudden thought: [...] "And where will Lord Gildoy be, do you suppose?" [...] he asked.|$|R
5000|$|Hags: Hideous female Demon-like {{creatures with}} green skin. <b>Filthy,</b> winged <b>creatures</b> that think they're beautiful. They {{live in the}} ruins of a {{crumbling}} manor deep {{in a part of the}} Nether called [...] "The Void". They are known to guard [...] "The Shadow", a strange power that allows those to find the one thing that they want most. They have the ability to suck the memories of a person's brain, considering it their favorite Dish.|$|R
5000|$|Reproach not the Firmament {{deep and}} blue, Forget thy {{stubborn}} nature {{to reveal a}} clue. [...] Neither expect from the Firmament any joy, When your own star you knowingly destroy. [...] Fruitless trees are, at best, fuel for fire, [...] Fruitless men, alike, to oblivion retire. [...] Forget about fragrant tresses and lips sweet, About hedges, and tulip cheeks to greet. [...] Lavish not praise on a <b>filthy</b> <b>creature,</b> With dastardly deeds as its only feature. [...] Adore not with verse the Lie or the Greed, Smite down the infidelsâ€™ most cherished creed. [...] Be not Unsuri, who groveling worshiped Mahmud, Lavished on him all flattery and paean he could. [...] I pledge never to sprinkle before the swine, These precious, peerless Dari pearls of mine. The poetry of Nasir Khusraw is replete with advice and wisdom. Being {{the representative of the}} Fatimid Imams in Khorasan, Nasir guided his followers through his poetry. His Persian poetry is enjoyed by the average Persian speaker of today and is taught in grade school. Some of the fables mentioned in his poems were eventually to find their way to the West. Among them is the story of The Gourd and the Palm-tree: ...|$|R
6000|$|Courbertin complied. [...] "'The coast {{people are}} Eskimo stock, merry {{of nature and}} not offensive. They call {{themselves}} the Oukilion, or the Sea Men. From them I bought dogs and food. But {{they are subject to}} the Chow Chuen, who live in the interior and are known as the Deer Men. The Chow Chuen are a fierce and savage race. When I left the coast they fell upon me, took from me my goods, and made me a slave.'" [...] He ran over a few pages. [...] "'I worked my way to a seat among the head men, but I was no nearer my freedom. My wisdom was of too great value to them for me to depart. [...] . Old Pi-Une was a great chief, and it was decreed that I should marry his daughter Ilswunga. Ilswunga was a <b>filthy</b> <b>creature.</b> She would not bathe, and her ways were not good [...] . I did marry Ilswunga, but she was a wife to me only in name. Then did she complain to her father, the old Pi-Une, and he was very wroth. And dissension was sown among the tribes; but in the end I became mightier than ever, what of my cunning and resource; and Ilswunga made no more complaint, for I taught her games with cards which she might play by herself, and other things.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Creeping to his side, {{we looked}} over the rocks. The place into which we gazed was a pit, and may, in the early days, {{have been one of}} the smaller {{volcanic}} blow-holes of the plateau. It was bowl-shaped and at the bottom, some hundreds of yards from where we lay, were pools of green-scummed, stagnant water, fringed with bullrushes. It was a weird place in itself, but its occupants made it seem like a scene from the Seven Circles of Dante. The place was a rookery of pterodactyls. There were hundreds of them congregated within view. All the bottom area round the water-edge was alive with their young ones, and with hideous mothers brooding upon their leathery, yellowish eggs. From this crawling flapping mass of obscene reptilian life came the shocking clamor which filled the air and the mephitic, horrible, musty odor which turned us sick. But above, perched each upon its own stone, tall, gray, and withered, more like dead and dried specimens than actual living creatures, sat the horrible males, absolutely motionless save for the rolling of their red eyes or an occasional snap of their rat-trap beaks as a dragon-fly went past them. Their huge, membranous wings were closed by folding their fore-arms, so that they sat like gigantic old women, wrapped in hideous web-colored shawls, and with their ferocious heads protruding above them. Large and small, not less than a thousand of these <b>filthy</b> <b>creatures</b> lay in the hollow before us.|$|R
6000|$|The castle {{was destined}} to stand, after all! Ruth's joy overflowed. She glanced hurriedly round for some object on which to expend it. There was nothing but the [...] "blessed babby"--and that was covered with tar; but genuine feeling does not stick at trifles. Ruth caught up the <b>filthy</b> little <b>creature,</b> pressed it to her {{bounding}} heart, wept and laughed, and covered it with passionate kisses {{to such an extent}} that her own fair face became thoroughly besmeared, and it cost Mrs Joe an additional half hour's labour to get her clean, besides an enormous expenditure of butter--though that was selling at the time at the high figure of 1 shilling 6 pence a pound! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More," [...] groans the alienist. [...] "A {{disease of}} the body is bad enough, but this seems to be a {{disease of the}} soul. Is it not a {{shocking}} thing--a thing to drive a reasoning man into absolute Materialism--to think that you may have a fine, noble fellow with every divine instinct and that some little vascular change, the dropping, we will say, of a minute spicule of bone from the inner table of his skull on to the surface of his brain may have the effect of changing him to a <b>filthy</b> and pitiable <b>creature</b> with every low and debasing tendency? What a satire an asylum is upon the majesty of man, and no less upon the ethereal nature of the soul." ...|$|R
