Naftogaz CEO Vladimir Trykolych said that Naftogaz owed $1.26–1.27billion to RosUkrEnergo in total, but claimed that Naftogaz had no debt to Gazprom. However, on December 2, Naftogaz {{acknowledged that it}} owed $1billion to Gazprom, {{and said it was}} having trouble making payments on time due to <b>unexpected</b> <b>losses</b> in 2008. Later in mid-December, Gazprom stated that a debt of $2.195billion had accumulated. In response, Naftogaz made a payment of $800million, and promised to pay another $200million soon. Gazprom proposed to make an upfront transit payment at the 2008 rate in order to provide funds for the debt to be cleared, but Naftogaz rejected the offer.|$|E
500|$|The 2016–17 {{season was}} marred by {{injuries}} and <b>unexpected</b> <b>losses</b> for the Cavaliers; James later described {{it as one of}} the [...] "strangest" [...] years of his career. Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, he publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too [...] "top heavy", for which he received criticism. The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game. In Game 3 of {{the first round of the}} postseason, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader. The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to their third consecutive Finals against the Warriors. Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.|$|E

50|$|An {{interesting}} phenomenon involving cortical maps is {{the incidence}} of phantom limbs (see Ramachandran for review). This is most commonly described in people that have undergone amputations in hands, arms, and legs, {{but it is not}} limited to extremities. The phantom limb feeling, which is thought to result from disorganization in the brain map and the inability to receive input from the targeted area, may be annoying or painful. Incidentally, it is more common after <b>unexpected</b> <b>losses</b> than planned amputations. There is a high correlation with the extent of physical remapping and the extent of phantom pain. As it fades, it is a fascinating functional example of new neural connections in the human adult brain.|$|E

40|$|Under the Basel II banking {{regulatory}} capital regime the capital requirements for credit exposures are calculated using the Asymptotic Single Risk Factor (ASRF) approach. The capital requirement {{is taken to}} be the contribution of an exposure to the <b>unexpected</b> <b>loss</b> on the bank's diversified portfolio. Here we extend this approach to calculate capital requirements for equity investments. We show {{that in the case}} when asset values have a normal distribution an analytical formula for the <b>unexpected</b> <b>loss</b> contribution may be developed. We show that the capital requirements for equity investments are quite different to those of credit exposures, since equity investments can suffer substantial loss of value even when the underlying company has not defaulted. <b>Unexpected</b> <b>loss</b> is commonly used as a measure of capital requirements, but it ignores the ability of earnings to absorb loss. We propose a definition of capital requirement that recognises the expected earnings on assets, and show how to combine the ASRF model and the Capital Asset Pricing Model to compute this quantity for credit and equity exposures.
