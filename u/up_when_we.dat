500|$|Recognition of Butcher's work {{came only}} later, when {{the history of}} the {{settlement}} of the Plains began to be written. [...] His photographs became staples of textbooks and popular works dealing with the homestead era. [...] According to Carter, [...] "They are the images that we conjure <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> think of plains settlement." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{performance}} {{earned him}} another Best Actor Academy Award nomination, 17 {{years after his}} first. Reviews were strong, and the film {{is considered one of}} the best of his later career. In Day, he found a co-star with whom he could build a rapport, such as he had had with Blondell at the start of his career. Day herself was full of praise for Cagney, stating that he was [...] "the most professional actor I've ever known. He was always 'real'. I simply forgot we were making a picture. His eyes would actually fill <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were working on a tender scene. And you never needed drops to make your eyes shine when Jimmy was on the set." ...|$|E
500|$|Of the {{original}} 40-member Leningrad Radio Orchestra, only 14 or 15 {{still lived in}} the city; the others had either starved to death or left to fight the enemy. Shostakovich's symphony required an expanded orchestra of 100 players, meaning the remaining personnel were grossly insufficient. Eliasberg, at the time being treated for [...] "dystrophy", went door to door to seek out those musicians who had not responded to the orchestra's reassembly due to starvation or weakness. [...] "My God, how thin many of them were," [...] one of the organizers remembered. [...] "How those people livened <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> started to ferret {{them out of their}} dark apartments. We were moved to tears when they brought out their concert clothes, their violins and cellos and flutes, and rehearsals began under the icy canopy of the studio." [...] A plane carrying supplies from Kuybyshev airlifted the symphony's 252-page conductor's score into Leningrad.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, the band had to remove two of the {{original}} tracks over allegations of copyright infringement. The two tracks, [...] "'Purity" [...] and [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", were inspired by a story that was published online about a girl named Purity Knight, who was kidnapped and buried alive. The website, called Crime Scene, presents fictional stories as real life crime cases. Originally, the website didn't include any disclaimer saying that it was a work of fiction. Many viewers believed that the story was true, including Slipknot frontman, Corey Taylor."I still think the story's real. It fucked our whole world <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> read it. Can you imagine a girl being buried in a box and have all this lecherous bullshit drip down on her from this guy? It just hurts your head." [...] The case was further {{complicated by the fact that}} audio samples from the authoring website were included in [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", which serves as a prelude to [...] "Purity".|$|E
2500|$|There {{were three}} {{casualties}} {{lying in the}} garden of Government House. You think: What sort of mood {{are they going to be}} in when their [...] are shot <b>up?</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> were actually lying down I felt a bit humiliated but I also felt apprehensive about what was going to happen next. One of the Argentine officers came along and actually struck one of the guards and told us to stand up. We stood up and he shook my hand and a few other guys' hands and said that we shouldn't lie down, that we should be proud of what we'd done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stenhouse, who tied a career-best Sprint Cup Series {{finish with}} a runner-up finish in a special paint scheme {{dedicated}} to the late Bryan Clauson, said afterwards that he [...] "knew {{we were going to}} have to get everything perfect, and it took me a minute to get the top going. I wanted to give <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were two [...] down, but I remembered we had Bryan Clauson’s tribute car here, and his favorite helmet, and I dug deep and the guys dug deep and made a lost of changes that made our Fastenal Ford a lot better. We really wanted to park it in Victory Lane for his whole family and all of his friends and fans for Tim, Di, Taylor and Lauren his fiancée… Just a little bit short." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is not settled yet. Warwick spoke {{somewhat}} of causing a {{rising in the}} north before he set sail, so that a portion at least of Edward's power may be <b>up</b> there <b>when</b> <b>we</b> make our landing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take him away," [...] he said, and two rough fellows, laughing, {{carried the}} bully {{to the edge}} of the {{fountain}} that played in the corner of the square. He was still lying crumpled <b>up</b> there <b>when</b> <b>we</b> rode out of Clayville.|$|R

2500|$|The {{official}} hiatus on musical broadcasts had to end {{before the}} symphony could be performed. This happened quickly, {{with a complete}} about-face by Party authorities. Next was reforming the orchestra. Only 15 members were still available; the others had either starved to death or left to fight the enemy. Posters went up, requesting all Leningrad musicians {{to report to the}} Radio Committee. Efforts were also made to seek out those musicians who could not come. [...] "My God, how thin many of them were," [...] one of the organizers of the performance remembered. [...] "How those people livened <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> started to ferret them out of their dark apartments. We were moved to tears when they brought out their concert clothes, their violins and cellos and flutes, and rehearsals began under the icy canopy of the studio." [...] Orchestral players were given additional rations.|$|E
2500|$|Bryant is also lauded for {{his work}} ethic. Through his first 16 seasons, his body was resilient, and he {{exhibited}} a high pain threshold while often playing through injuries. [...] A fierce competitor, opponents and teammates alike have been {{the object of his}} scorn. Many players have considered him difficult to play with because of his high level of commitment and performance. According to sportswriter Mark Heisler of Forbes, [...] "circa 2004–2007, Kobe was the most alienated superstar the NBA had ever seen." [...] He did, however, lead the Lakers to two championships post-O'Neal while becoming more of a mentor to his teammates. Bryant's longtime head coach Phil Jackson noted that the biggest difference during his second tenure in coaching the Lakers was that [...] " [...] embraced the team and his teammates, calling them <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were on the road and inviting them out to dinner. It was as if the other players were now his partners, not his personal spear-carriers." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{legacy of}} what is now the Nintendogs series {{originated}} because of 64DD, {{in the form of a}} pet creature breeding prototype called Cabbage. Never released, it had been codeveloped by Shigesato Itoi (designer of EarthBound), Tsunekazu Ishihara (designer of Pokémon), and Shigeru Miyamoto. Its publicized four-year development was fundamentally enabled by the realtime clock and mass writability, where Miyamoto explained, [...] "We're doing it on the 64DD because I wanted to make a clock function, such that even if the power is cut, [...] can still raise the creature" [...] and with optionally purchasable enhancement data; A subset of creature maintenance functionality is made portable on the Game Boy via the Transfer Pak, to be synchronized back to the 64DD disk. In 2006, Miyamoto concluded that [...] "the conversations and design techniques that popped <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were making Cabbage are, of course, connected to Nintendogs and other things that we're doing now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad," [...] she said, [...] "that {{our party}} breaks <b>up</b> to-morrow. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> meet again, Lawrence, {{it must be}} differently. I am parting {{with a great deal}} that has been {{precious}} to me, but it must be. It is quite clear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Deering agreed. [...] "In the meantime, we're {{baffling}} the police. Just now I expect they're busy {{looking for}} our tracks, {{but they have}} got other jobs and can't keep it <b>up.</b> Well, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> think they're forced to quit, we'll find a plan----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, of course, we {{gave you}} <b>up</b> again, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{heard of the}} {{massacre}} of the mission; {{and it seemed like}} a resurrection from the dead when I got a letter from Roberts, saying you were found again, and that he was recommending you for a commission.|$|R
2500|$|Tripoli was {{occupied}} unopposed on 13 October by the 7th (Meerut) Division led once {{again by the}} XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment and the 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery following Bulfin's orders for {{the continuation of the}} coastal advance northwards. The leading column was followed by the 19th Infantry Brigade Group commanded by Brigadier General W. S. Leslie which arrived on 18 October. The remainder of the 7th (Meerut) Division arrived not long after. Rothon arrived in Tripoli on 18 October, after a [...] march over mountain passes and sand. [...] "Felt absolutely done <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> got here and at times felt like lying down and giving in as I feel as if my very life blood is being drawn from me in these long marches, in addition to which we are only at half strength which means double work for us all." [...] He was hospitalised in Tripoli shortly after and was still there {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this part}} of the approach, the {{processor}} would normally be almost 85% loaded. The extra 6,400 cycle steals per second added the equivalent of 13% load, leaving just enough time for all scheduled tasks to run to completion. Five minutes into the descent, Buzz Aldrin gave the computer the command 1668 which instructed it to calculate and display DELTAH (the difference between altitude sensed by the radar and the computed altitude). This added an additional 10% to the processor workload, causing executive overflow and a 1202 alarm. After being given the [...] "GO" [...] from Houston, Aldrin entered 1668 again and another 1202 alarm occurred. When reporting the second alarm, Aldrin added the comment [...] "It appears to come <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> have a 1668 up". The AGC software had been designed with priority scheduling, and automatically recovered, deleting lower priority tasks including the 1668 display task, to complete its critical guidance and control tasks. Guidance controller Steve Bales and his support team that included Jack Garman issued several [...] "GO" [...] calls and the landing was successful. For his role, Bales received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom on behalf of the entire control center team and the three Apollo astronauts.|$|E

50|$|Walden {{served as}} Press Secretary and Chief of Staff to Congressman Denny Smith from 1981 to 1987. He {{was elected to}} the Oregon House of Representatives in 1988 and served in the House until 1995, when he was {{appointed}} to the Oregon State Senate to fill a vacancy that opened <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>Wes</b> Cooley {{was elected to the}} U.

However, upon discovering that the son {{he and his wife were}} expecting had a heart defect, Walden decided to not run for Governor and to not seek re-election to the state Senate. Their son died soon after birth.|$|R

60|$|A stern chase is proverbially a long chase, {{but still}} the enemy with their skilled rowers came <b>up</b> fast. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> were {{a mile from the}} reeds they were within half a mile of us, and as we tired the {{proportion}} of distance lessened. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> were two hundred yards from the reeds they were not more than fifty or sixty yards behind, and then the real struggle began.|$|R
