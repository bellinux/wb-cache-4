40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} evaluation of texture via <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>measurements</b> because of the advantages when compared to evaluation by diffraction techniques. First, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>measurements</b> are much more rapid and have the potential of being used concurrently while processing. Second, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>measurements</b> are nondestructive while diffraction techniques require coupons to be cut for samples. Third, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>measurements,</b> like neutron diffraction, sample the bulk of the test material while, in contrast, x-ray diffraction samples a thin surface layer. The primary disadvantage of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>measurements</b> is that the textural evaluation must be based on a quite limited amount of data whereas diffraction evaluation is normally based upon a very extensive number of measured points. In spite of this disadvantage, research has shown that <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>measurements</b> are potentially useful.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{ultrasonic}} models and measurements {{are used to}} characterize {{a number of the}} important elements of an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>measurement</b> system as well as the entire system. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>measurement</b> models for predicting the response from reference reflectors are described, including a new <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>measurement</b> model recently developed to simulate the ultrasonic response of an infinitely long cylindrical cavity. The reference reflectors considered include spherical pores, flat-bottom holes and side-drilled holes, which are commonly used in nondestructive evaluation studies. These reflectors are employed in a series of modeling/experimental studies to assess where approximate and more exact scattering models are needed and to estimate the significance of beam variations over the reflector surface. Model-based simulated flaw responses are compared to experimentally determined flaw responses from these reference reflectors and the accuracy of the models is discussed.;The role that an ultrasonic piezoelectric transducer plays in an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>measurement</b> system can be described in terms of the transducer 2 ̆ 7 s input electrical impedance and its sensitivity. A new model-based method for simultaneously determining the impedance and sensitivity of commercial ultrasonic immersion transducers is developed. This method is based on a pulse-echo setup and relies only on electrical measurements. It is demonstrated that sensitivities obtained with this new method agree well with the sensitivities obtained using a more complex three-transducer method originally developed for lower-frequency acoustic transducers that has been used in many previous studies. The influence of the pulser/receiver settings on the transducer electrical impedance and sensitivity is also discussed. Cabling effects present are compensated for in the new pulse-echo method.;The transducer impedance and sensitivity measurements obtained using this new pulse-echo method are combined with measurements/models for all the other electrical elements in an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>measurement</b> system to determine a system transfer function that characterizes the effect of all the electrical and electromechanical components in the system.
