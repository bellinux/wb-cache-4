5|$|Full {{capital letters}} {{are not used}} as IPA symbols. They are, however, often used for archiphonemes and for natural classes of phonemes (that is, as wildcards). Such usage {{is not part of}} the IPA or even standardized, and may be {{ambiguous}} between authors, but it is commonly <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> the IPA. (The extIPA chart, for example, uses one or two wildcards in its illustrations.)

5|$|A numerically {{controlled}} oscillator (NCO) is a digital signal generator which creates a synchronous (i.e. clocked), discrete-time, discrete-valued {{representation of a}} waveform, usually sinusoidal. NCOs are often <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) at the output to create a direct digital synthesizer (DDS).|$|E

Though the Sega CD is an add-on, it does require its own separate power supply. In addition to playing its own library of games in CD-ROM format, the Sega CD can also play compact discs, karaoke CD+G discs, and can also be <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> the 32X to play 32-bit games that utilize both add-ons. The second model, also known as the Sega CD 2, also includes a steel joining plate to be screwed into the bottom of the Genesis, as well as an extension spacer to work with the original model of the Genesis.|$|E

5|$|Three {{of the six}} prion {{species have}} bills filled with lamellae, which act as filters to sift {{zooplankton}} from the water. Water is forced through the lamellae and small prey items are collected.

5|$|Besides {{measuring}} stellar motions {{within the}} Milky Way, SIM Lite was {{to measure the}} internal and average galactic motion {{of some of the}} neighboring galaxies near the Milky Way. The telescope's measurements were to be <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> other, currently available, data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies. These numbers would enable scientists to estimate the spatial distribution of dark matter in the local group of galaxies, and by extension, throughout the universe.|$|E
5|$|Between 1973 and 1978, {{together}} with Dutch researcher Stan Tempelaars (1938–2010), Kaegi developed the VOSIM program. VOSIM, {{which stands for}} VOice SIMulator, is a system based on the digital sound synthesis of simple, sinusoidal square waves, allowing the modeling of vowel sounds, vocal fricatives and quasi-instrumental tones. It complemented, and was <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with,</b> Gottfried Michael Koenig's own computer-generated music programs Project 1 (1964), Project 2 (1966) and SSP (1971). Werner Kaegi summed up the VOSIM system in 1986 in a presentation for the scientific journal Interface.|$|E
