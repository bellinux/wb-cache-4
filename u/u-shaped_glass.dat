50|$|These {{devices are}} {{also known as}} glass {{capillary}} viscometers or Ostwald viscometers, named after Wilhelm Ostwald. Another version is the Ubbelohde viscometer, which consists of a <b>U-shaped</b> <b>glass</b> tube held vertically in a controlled temperature bath. In one arm of the U is a vertical section of precise narrow bore (the capillary). Above there is a bulb, with it is another bulb lower down on the other arm. In use, liquid is drawn into the upper bulb by suction, then allowed to flow down through the capillary into the lower bulb. Two marks (one above and one below the upper bulb) indicate a known volume. The time taken for {{the level of the}} liquid to pass between these marks is proportional to the kinematic viscosity. Most commercial units are provided with a conversion factor, or can be calibrated by a fluid of known properties.The time required for the test liquid to flow through a capillary of a known diameter of a certain factor between two marked points is measured. By multiplying the time taken by the factor of the viscometer, the kinematic viscosity is obtained.|$|E

40|$|Background: We analyse {{here the}} {{well-known}} U-shaped form of pH-dependence of glass corrosion rates U(t) focusing on changes of U-shaped form with time. Methods: We {{account for the}} two main mechanisms of glass corrosion which play dominant role at different times - ion exchange and hydrolysis. Results: We reveal that the pH dependence evolves even for solutions ostensibly kept at constant pH. The U(t) dependence is caused by changes of concentration profiles of elements in the nearsurface layers of glasses in contact with water. The change is most evident within {{the initial stages of}} glass corrosion at relatively low temperatures. Numerical examples are given for the Russian nuclear waste borosilicate glass K- 26 characterised in experiment by an effective diffusion coefficient for caesium DCs = 4. 5 10 - 12 cm 2 /day and by a rate of glass hydrolysis in non-saturated groundwater as high as rh = 100 nm/year. Conclusion: The changes of the <b>U-shaped</b> form of <b>glass</b> corrosion rates need to be accounted for when assessing the performance of glasses in contact with water solutions...|$|R
40|$|PosterDusty plasmas are {{a unique}} {{possibility}} {{to study the}} formation of nanoparticles from the gas phase in a closed and controlled laboratory setup. Particle growth is interesting regarding fundamental physics but in addition biomedical and industrial applications are under investigation. The objective of this work covers the study of dust formation in a dc discharge. The dc discharge is run inside an <b>u-shaped</b> <b>glass</b> cylinder. It is operated by two electrodes to which voltages up to 2 kV can be applied. In order to capture particles the polarity of the voltage can be switched. An rf coil is wrapped around the tube which is operated at 13, 56 MHz and a peak-to-peak voltage of 200 V. The chamber is operated with Argon and mixtures of Argon with Acetylene at pressures around 100 Pa. Hence the growth is observed from etching particles laying {{on the surface of}} the glass tube, injected particles captured in the plasma, and in the gas phase by chemical reactions from Acetylene. The major prospective is to compare the growth mechanisms with those observed in experiments using rf discharges...|$|E
40|$|Scattering methods like X-ray or neutron small-angle {{scattering}} and dynamic light scattering are standard methods for {{the characterization of}} amphiphilic aggregates like micelles, vesicles and gels. Rheological experiments show the formation of gels indicated by a strong increase of the viscosity. Precision measurements {{of the speed of}} sound waves (pulse method) can be used to follow the micellization process. This new technique utilizes the dependence of the speed of sound waves on the number of dissolved particles at fixed concentration. Experimental results show the formation of micelles in a triblock copolymer (P- 85) solution in the concentration range from 0. 5 % to 30 % (W/W). Precision densitometry uses the mechanical oscillator method based on the measurement of the eigenfrequency of a <b>U-shaped</b> <b>glass</b> tube. By introduction of a phase shifted excitation it is possible to measure the ratio between the damping force and the spring force of the system where the damping force is related to the viscosity of the fluid. With this instrument it is possible to detect the formation and the dissolution of the gel phase of P- 85. The data from ultra-sound velocimetry and densitometry can be used together with scattering data to establish a phase diagram of the P- 85 solution...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{analysis}} of trace gases from fluid inclusions of minerals has been developed. The purge and trap GC-MS system is based on the system described by Nolting et al. (1988) and was optimized for the analyses of halogenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) having boiling points as low as - 128. °C (carbon tetrafluoride). The sample preconcentration cold trap consists of a <b>U-shaped</b> <b>glass</b> lined steel tube (GLT™), that is immersed into a small liquid nitrogen Dewar vessel for cooling. A rapid desorption step heats up the preconcentration tube in < 30 s from - 196 °C to 200 °C. The process is carried out by using a pressurized air stream to dissipate the liquid nitrogen followed by resistive heating of the trap. The design of the cold trap and the direct transfer of desorbed analytes onto the GC column via a deactivated capillary column retention gap made sample refocusing within the GC oven unnecessary. Furthermore, a special air-tight grinding device was developed in which samples ranging from soft halite (hardness 2, Mohs scale) to hard quartz (hardness 7) are effectively ground to average diameters of 1000 nm or below, thereby releasing gases from fluid inclusions of minerals. The gases are then purged from the grinding chamber with a He carrier gas flow. The detection and quantitative determination of gases, such as SF 6 and CF 4 released from fluorites and CH 3 Cl from halite samples is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Variations in barium (Ba) {{stable isotope}} abundances {{measured}} in {{low and high}} temperature environments have recently received increasing attention. The actual processes controlling Ba isotope fractionation, however, remain mostly elusive. In this study, we present the first experimental approach to quantify the contribution of diffusion and adsorption on mass- dependent Ba isotope fractionation during transport of aqueous Ba 2 + ions through a porous medium. Experiments {{have been carried out}} in which a BaCl 2 solution of known isotopic composition diffused through <b>u-shaped</b> <b>glass</b> tubes filled with silica hydrogel at 10 C and 25 C for up to 201 days. The diffused Ba was highly fractionated by up to - 2. 15 ‰ in d 137 / 134 Ba, despite the low relative difference in atomic mass. The time-dependent isotope fractionation can be successfully reproduced by a diffusive transport model accounting for mass-dependent differences in the effective diffusivities of the Ba isotope species (D 137 Ba/D 134 Ba = (m 134 /m 137) ^b). Values of b extracted from the transport model were in the range of 0. 010 – 0. 011. Independently conducted batch experiments revealed that adsorption of Ba onto the surface of silica hydrogel favoured the heavier Ba isotopes (a = 1. 00015 ± 0. 00008). The contribution of adsorption on the overall isotope fractionation in the diffusion experiments, however, was found to be small. Our results contribute to the understanding of Ba isotope fractionation pro- cesses, which is crucial for interpreting natural isotope variations and the assessment of Ba isotope ratios as geochemical proxies...|$|E
40|$|Volatile organic halocarbons (VOX) play an {{important}} role in atmospheric processes. However, biogeochemical release mechanisms from terrestrial environments are complex, not well understood in most parts and a clear view of their relative importance is lacking. Previously, the lithospheric VOX formation potential was subject of only few studies. In the first part of this thesis the development of a new method for the analysis of VOX from rocks and minerals is reported in order to investigate terrigenic VOX formation potential. The purge and trap GC-MS system was optimized for the analyses of halogenated volatile organic compounds having boiling points as low as - 128 °C for carbon tetrafluoride (CF 4). The design of the <b>U-shaped</b> <b>glass</b> lined steel tube (GLT™) cold trap for sample preconcentration and the rapid desorption via resistant heating transferred the desorbed analytes directly onto the GC column via a deactivated capillary column retention gap made sample re-focussing unnecessary. Furthermore, a special air-tight grinding device was developed in which samples ranging from soft halite (hardness 2, Moh’s scale) to hard quartz (hardness 7) are effectively ground to average diameters of 1000 nm or below, thereby releasing gases from fluid inclusions of minerals. The gases are then purged from the grinding chamber with a He carrier gas flow. In the second part of this work, the newly developed method is applied to a set of various mineral and rock samples including fluorite, quartz and halite. The analytical results from GC-MS prove the presence of a wide spectrum of volatile compounds from FIs trapped in various minerals. SF 6 and CF 4 were released from fluorites. Methyl bromide, dichloroethene and dichloroethane were detected in quartz samples from the Archean Yilgarn craton in Australia. Methyl chloride (MeCl) has been detected from almost all samples, including halites, fluorites, quartz and dolerites. Initial heating experiments with halites using purge-and-trap GC-MS as well as pyrolysis-GC-MS demonstrated the important role of temperature in MeCl and VOX formation. Finally, in the last part of this dissertation a case study on one possible formation pathway for the volatile compounds MeCl and dimethylsulfide (DMS), via thermolytic degradation of the amino acid derivative methyl methionine is investigated. A fast response of MeCl and dimethylsulfide emission upon heating of freeze-dried samples at 40 °C was observed and made this a plausible abiotic volatile formation mechanism. Besides the mechanistic studies with methyl methionine and structurally related substances, the emission of MeCl and DMS from fluid inclusions, soil samples of terrestrial salt lakes and air sampled immediately above the salt lake surfaces indicated the relevance of this formation pathway for hypersaline environments...|$|E
