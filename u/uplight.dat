25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using full cutoff roadway lights to combat light pollution {{has also been}} called into question. According to design investigations, luminaires with full cutoff distributions (as opposed to cutoff or semi cutoff, compared here) have to be closer together to meet the same light level, uniformity and glare requirements specified by the IESNA. These simulations optimized the height and spacing of the lights while constraining the overall design to meet the IESNA requirements, and then compared total <b>uplight</b> and energy consumption of different luminaire designs and powers. Cutoff designs performed better than full cutoff designs, and semi-cutoff performed better than either cutoff or full cutoff. This indicates that, in roadway installations, over-illumination or poor uniformity produced by full cutoff fixtures may be more detrimental than direct <b>uplight</b> created by fewer cutoff or semi-cutoff fixtures. Therefore, the overall performance of existing systems could be improved more by {{reducing the number of}} luminaires than by switching to full cutoff designs.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Uplighting</b> is less common, {{often used}} to bounce {{indirect}} light off the ceiling and back down. It is commonly used in lighting applications that require minimal glare and uniform general illuminance levels. <b>Uplighting</b> (indirect) uses a diffuse surface to reflect light in a space and can minimize disabling glare on computer displays and other dark glossy surfaces. It gives a more uniform presentation of the light output in operation. However indirect lighting is completely reliant upon the reflectance value of the surface. While indirect lighting can create a diffused and shadow free light effect it {{can be regarded as}} an uneconomical lighting principle.|$|R

5000|$|Semicutoff: This is {{the most}} popular street {{lighting}} optic. The semicutoff fixtures usually refer to the cobraheads, but they can also apply to some lamppost-mounted fixtures that do not emit their light upwards. Most of the light can be emitted below 90 degrees, but as much as 5% of the light can also be emitted above 90 degrees. These fixtures {{do a good job of}} spreading the light towards the ground but some <b>uplight</b> is possible, though not as serious as non-cutoff fixtures. Semicutoff fixtures are often mounted on tall poles. Examples of semicutoff optics include the bowl-shaped diffuser on GE's M400s made prior to 1997, and the prismatic one shared by the Westinghouse OV-25, Crouse-Hinds L250 and OVM, and Cooper OVD. These fixtures are commonly seen with both mercury vapor and HPS lamps (and sometimes metal halide as well).|$|E

5000|$|In Hinduism light symbolizes {{not only}} {{everything}} with a divine quality, {{but also the}} illumination of mind.

The dawns, Usha, the sister of the sun, brings hope and she woke the mortal beings <b>up.Light</b> is the essential nature of the soul and it plays {{a crucial role in the}} Hindu culture: people pray to invoke the god of lights, Savitr, to illuminate the world and their minds, and to free them from ignorance and delusion.The most important celebration of light in Hinduism is the Diwali: it represent both the victory of light over darkness, and the beginning of the financial year.

50|$|Idea: Dimasa has {{a concept}} and idea to <b>uplight</b> his own society. It has an {{education}} for preparation of intellectual. Dimasa has {{a conception of}} philosophy to rebirth the soul.Social: A Dimasa family generally consists {{of the head of}} the family, his wife, their unmarried son and daughter and unmarried brothers and sisters of the family.Dimasa Kachari has forty male clans called Sengphong and forty two female clan called Julu. The Dimasa society has its own society system of marriage. Existence of female clans along with the male can makes the Dimasa marriage somewhat complicated. The male clans and female clans are exogamous and no marriage can take place between the boys and the girls of the same clan whether be it patri clan or matri clan and however distantly related they might be i.e. A boy belong to Kemprai clan (Patri clan can never marry a girl of a Kemprai father although they might be very distantly related. The same principal is followed in case of the female clan also i.e. a girl belong to madaima mother.)The Ritual performance: The Dimasa have a cremation ground called Mangkhulong. Dimasa cremate the dead body after death. But in olden times and days, this performance has to be conducted after one month or a year gathering all relation and others.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Traditional {{industrial}} luminaires possess {{little if}} any <b>uplight</b> component. As a result, ceiling surface luminances {{and in some cases}} wall luminances in industrial settings tend to be low, giving the overall environment a cave-like appearance. Although this type of lighting can provide the required quantity of light on the work surface, it does little to address other design issues including the psycho-logical needs of the industrial worker. Can room surface brightnesses in an industrial environment affect an industrial worker’s visual perception and sense of satisfaction with that environment? This study compared four commercially available industrial lighting systems, each with a different percent-age of <b>uplight.</b> Actual industrial workers from various companies evaluated the systems in an industrial-like setting. Both a semantic differential scaling technique and a lighting-specific evaluation technique were used in the study. The results indicate a preference on the part of industrial workers for an environment with higher average room surface luminances. Impressions of spaciousness, brightness and stimulation correlated with an overall preference for higher surface luminances. The implication is that the psychological impact of lighting in the industrial environment should be an important consid-eration during the design process for industrial spaces. ...|$|E
