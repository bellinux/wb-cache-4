40|$|There {{is often}} {{assumed to be}} a <b>unit</b> <b>elasticity</b> of {{substitution}} between capital and labour. But estimates based on neoclassical capital demand equations frequently find a smaller value. Recent time-series work for the United States and Canada has suggested that, once the biases inherent in estimating cointegrating vectors are properly accounted for, the elasticity could indeed be close to 1. This paper investigates this possibility for the United Kingdom. First the analysis considers aggregate data where the estimated elasticity is close to 0. 4. Then a unique industry-level data set for the United Kingdom is exploited in order to further pinpoint the estimated elasticity. Estimates using dynamic panel data methods are close to those from aggregate data, providing a robust statistical rejection of a <b>unit</b> <b>elasticity</b> in UK data. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} price {{system and the}} wage {{equation}} {{in the presence of}} taxes. Price formation is analysed at three levels: producer’s prices, trade in consumer goods and, separately, in services, and at the aggregate level of the cost of living index. This is in the spirit of classical macromodels that usually apply the “bottom-to-top” approach. However, because of nonstationarity of variables, this study employs multivariate cointegration. The empirical investigation is based on Polish monthly data covering the period from January 1993 to December 2003. Its results allow to conclude that as many as five stable long-run relationships drove inflation in Poland in that period. Appropriate decomposition of price formation made it possible to incorporate all conditions postulated by economic theory (i. e. homogeneity, <b>unit</b> <b>elasticities)</b> and to show how direct and indirect taxes impact decisions made by the employers and employees. ...|$|R

The final channel assumes finite lifetimes and no bequest motive.

40|$|The long-run {{equilibrium}} {{relationship among}} money, income, prices, {{and interest rates}} in Japan is investigated by the threshold cointegration test, which allows for asymmetric adjustment, introduced by Enders and Siklos (2001).

By allowing for asymmetric adjustment, results are obtained showing {{the stability of the}} money demand function, similar to Lucas (1988), who pointed out that the money demand function is stable if <b>unit</b> income <b>elasticity</b> is imposed. In particular, the estimated results show that the adjustment process toward equilibrium is highly persistent above an appropriately estimated threshold, whereas the adjustment process toward equilibrium quickly converges below it. This finding indicates that deviations from equilibrium resulting from increases in money or decreases in income and prices are highly persistent. ...|$|R

To account for the impact of income distribution, preferences are such that consumers rank indivisible goods according to a hierarchy of both needs and desires. The composition of the aggregate consumption basket in the integrated economy depends on both inter- and intra-national inequality.

These economies of scale may reflect production economies or suggest that larger systems are better than smaller systems at bargaining and can obtain inputs at a lower unit cost.
