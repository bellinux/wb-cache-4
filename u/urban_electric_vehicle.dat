30|$|The {{proposed}} {{model is}} thus {{based on the}} main concept of using the right tool for the right distance rather than using ICEVs for all applications. The model will focus on <b>urban</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> used in large cities and urban centers where low-speed traffic is a typical characteristic. The scenario matches with the motorists’ driving habits especially the average distance traveled every day. Data collected by the National Personal Transportation Survey (NPTS) in 1995 indicates {{that the majority of}} US daily mileages are relatively short, with 50 % of days being less than 30 miles per day (48  km per day) [6]. On the other hand, statistics in Germany indicate that 90 % of daily driving is in the range of 62 miles per day (100  km per day) [3]. Accordingly, the proposed model of an urban EV with 60 miles (97  km) range, 90  km/h top speed and Lithium-ion battery will be the focus of this study. The following analysis investigates the various benefits and costs of the proposed urban EV and shows that it is a compelling business case that deserves to be examined and nurtured.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the work of}} creating and validating a novel corner module for a three-wheeled <b>urban</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> in the tadpole configuration. As the urban population increases, {{there will be a}} growing need for compact, personal transportation. While urban electric vehicles are compact, they are inherently less stable when negotiating a turn, and they leave little space for passengers, cargo and crash structures. Corner modules provide an effective solution to increase the space in the cabin and increase the handling capabilities of the vehicle. Many corner module designs have been produced in the hopes of increasing the cabin space and improving the road holding capabilities of the wheel. However, none have been used to increase the turning stability of the vehicle via an active camber mechanism while remaining in an acceptable packaging space. Active camber mechanisms are also not a new concept, but they have not been implemented in a narrow packaging space with relatively large camber angle. Parallel mechanism research and vehicle dynamics theory were combined to generate and analyse this new corner module design. The corner module increases the stability of the <b>urban</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> by cambering the front wheels to - 15 degrees when the vehicle is turning. The camber angle augmentation increases the track width which subsequently decreases the center of gravity height. These changes accumulated to increase the stability of the vehicle. The corner module uses two actuators to control the orientation of the wheel. Bias ply tires are incorporated into the corner module to enable the large camber angles. To increase the space in the cabin, the front left and right wheels are not connected by a mechanical linkage, and the motors are mounted to the wheel rim. While disc brakes are integrated into the corner module, the motor is also capable of regenerative braking. By integrating this corner module into urban electric vehicles, the vehicle size and pollution can be reduced while increasing the cabin space and public space...|$|E

Dynamometer tests were first performed, followed by eV performance predictions and data correlating road tests. During dynamometer tests using chopper control; current, voltage, and power were measured on both the battery and motor sides of the chopper, using three types of instrumentation. Conventional dc instruments provided adequate accuracy for eV power and energy measurements, when used on the battery side of the controller.

The eleven Hyperminis were deployed for various periods between January 2001 and June 2005. During the combined total of 439 months of use, the eleven Hyperminis were driven a total of 41, 220 miles by staff from both cities. This equates to an average use of about 22 miles per week per vehicle. There were some early problems with the vehicles, including a charging problem and a need to upgrade the electrical system. In addition, six vehicles required drive system repairs. However, the repairs were all made under warranty. The Hyperminis were generally well-liked and provided drivers with the ability to travel any of the local roads. Full charging of the Hypermini’s lithiumion battery pack required up to 4 hours, with about 8 – 10 miles of range available for each hour of battery charging. With its right-side steering wheel, some accommodation of the drivers’ customary driving methods was required to adapt for different blind spots and vehicle manipulation. For that reason, the drivers received orientation and training before using the vehicle. The Hypermini is instrumented in kilometers rather than in miles, which required an adjustment for the drivers to calculate speed and range. As the drivers gained familiarity with the vehicles, there was increased acceptance and a preference for using it over traditional city vehicles. In all cases, the Hyperminis attracted a great amount of attention and interest from the general public...|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} {{developments}} contributed to decline of electric cars. Improved road infrastructure required a greater range than that offered by electric cars, {{and the discovery}} of large reserves of petroleum in Texas, Oklahoma, and California led to the wide availability of affordable gasoline/petrol, making internal combustion powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances. Also internal combustion powered cars became ever easier to operate thanks to {{the invention of the}} electric starter by Charles Kettering in 1912, which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks {{to the use of the}} muffler, which Hiram Percy Maxim had invented in 1897. As roads were improved outside <b>urban</b> areas <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> range could not compete with the ICE. Finally, the initiation of mass production of gasoline-powered vehicles by Henry Ford in 1913 reduced significantly the cost of gasoline cars as compared to electric cars.|$|R
30|$|To get a {{clear idea}} about the {{gasoline}} savings of electric vehicles, we will start by calculating the gasoline consumption in conventional vehicles based on EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) data [11]. The average fuel consumption of conventional vehicles ranges from 18 MpG (7.7  km/L) to 25 MpG (10.6  km/L). For easy comparison with the urban vehicle model proposed above, we can safely assume that vehicles drive on average 20, 000 miles (32187  km) per year (given the 60 mile/ 97  km daily mileage). The gasoline consumption thus, ranges from 800 to 1100  gal (3028 to 4164  L) per year. For an average gasoline price of $ 3 /gal, fuel savings range from $ 2400 to $ 3300 per year. Of course, these gasoline savings imply an increase in electricity consumption for charging the batteries of electric vehicles. Field tests indicate that the energy consumption of modern urban EVs varies from 0.2 to 0.3  kWh/mile (0.12 to 0.19  kWh/km) [2, 12, 13] so, the total electricity consumption is calculated to be from 4000 to 6000  kWh per year. Therefore, for the current average electricity US price of 10 cents per kWh [14], EV electricity consumption per year ranges from $ 400 to $ 600. It {{is obvious that the}} annual fuel cost of an <b>urban</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> is about 6 times less than a gasoline one.|$|E

A 14 -degree-of-freedom model of this vehicle {{has been used to}} develop a genetic fuzzy yaw moment controller. The genetic fuzzy yaw moment controller determines the corrective yaw moment that is required to stabilize the vehicle, and applies a virtual yaw moment around the vertical axis of the vehicle. In this work, an advanced torque vectoring controller is developed, the objective of which is to generate the required corrective yaw moment through the torque intervention of the individual in-wheel motors, stabilizing the vehicle during both normal and emergency driving maneuvers. Novel algorithms are developed for the left-to-right torque vectoring control on each axle and for the front-to-rear torque vectoring distribution action. Several maneuvers are simulated to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed advanced torque vectoring controller, and the results are compared to those obtained using the ideal genetic fuzzy yaw moment controller. The advanced torque vectoring controller is also implemented in a hardware- and operator-in-the-loop driving simulator to further evaluate its performance.
