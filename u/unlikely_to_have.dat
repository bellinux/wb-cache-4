5|$|Although the {{decision}} emasculated NIRA, it had little practical impact, as Congress was <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> reauthorized the Act in any case.|$|E
5|$|The {{planet is}} <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> large moons, since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short {{timescales}} {{relative to the}} age of the system.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the {{collision}} of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies should be underway. Although this {{could result in the}} Solar System being ejected from the newly combined galaxy, it is considered <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> any adverse effect on the Sun or planets.|$|E
50|$|The ACIC’s coercive {{powers are}} used in special {{operations}} and special investigations to obtain information where traditional law enforcement methods are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be or <b>have</b> not been effective.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{therefore}} <b>unlikely</b> for there <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a [...] "Norman" [...] fortification/castle in Dunsany before 1305.|$|R
50|$|After {{an unusually}} long stretch in the OR, Hawkeye and Trapper argue, and {{decide that they}} need some R&R. Unfortunately, Henry is leaving for a few days, leaving Frank—who is <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> let them <b>have</b> R&R for any reason—in charge.|$|R
5|$|The gods {{involved}} in a festival also received various offerings in much larger quantities than in daily ceremonies. The enormous amounts of food listed in festival texts are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been divided among the priests alone, so {{it is likely that}} the celebrating commoners also participated in the reversion of these offerings.|$|E
5|$|This classically {{designed}} wing {{has been}} attributed to Inigo Jones, but without supporting evidence; as with a similar attribution at Brympton d'Evercy, also in Somerset, it seems to be based solely on the alternating segmental and pointed pediments over the groundfloor windows, and ignoring the irregularities in their spacings and placings, which Jones is <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> countenanced.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australian's that volunteered {{to fight in}} Russia can only be guessed at, it seems <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been political. Regardless, they {{confirmed}} a reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home {{at the time and}} made little difference to the outcome of the war. Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia.|$|E
50|$|Hybrid {{vehicles}} {{may have}} a very small 12 volt battery system unsuitable for sourcing {{the large amount of}} current required to boost a conventional vehicle. However, as the 12-volt system of a hybrid vehicle is only required to start up the control system of the vehicle, a very small portable battery may successfully boost a hybrid that has accidentally discharged its 12-volt system; the main propulsion battery is <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> also <b>have</b> been discharged.|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{going back}} to the {{questions}} raised at the end of Section 1, results from the Mandarin corpus analysis provide unambiguous evidence that both conceptual and positional factors are operating in the preverbal domain, but positional factors are much more prominent than conceptual factors in the postverbal domain. These results also showed that the relative sensitivity to conceptual (or positional) factors can vary within the language and is <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>have</b> risen solely from headedness.|$|R
40|$|Travelers, {{particularly}} those whose tastes or occupations lead to {{deviation from the}} usual tourist routes, are at a small but significant risk of acquiring certain diseases they would be <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> encounter <b>had</b> they remained in the continental United States. Many of these infections can be rendered unlikely even for the most adventuresome traveler through the appropriate use of immunization and chemoprophylaxis. Other infections are currently unpreventable and the physician's responsibility lies in their premorbid detection...|$|R
5|$|Significantly, the {{possibility}} that Dietrich may have been acquitted differentiates this case from the unsuccessful 1979 McInnis v R. appeal. McInnis, like Dietrich, had appealed to the High Court against his conviction, arguing that the failure to adjourn the proceedings while McInnis sought legal representation resulted in a miscarriage of justice. However, {{the majority in the}} McInnis appeal found that McInnis was very <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been acquitted, even with full representation. This was clearly not the case with Dietrich.|$|E
5|$|The {{postponement}} of Barbarossa {{from the}} initially planned date of 15 May {{to the actual}} invasion date of 22 June 1941 (a 38-day delay) occurred {{for a number of}} reasons. Most importantly, an unusually wet winter kept rivers at full flood until late spring. The full floods could have discouraged an earlier attack, even if it was <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> happened {{before the end of the}} Balkans Campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} the vulcanoid zone is very small {{compared}} to that of the asteroid belt. Collisions between objects in the vulcanoid zone would be frequent and highly energetic, tending to lead to the destruction of the objects. The most favourable location for vulcanoids is probably in circular orbits near {{the outer edge of the}} vulcanoid zone. Vulcanoids are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> inclinations of more than about 10° to the ecliptic. Mercury trojans, asteroids trapped in Mercury's Lagrange points, are also possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the seal was {{finalized}} on April 30, 1863, {{and a set of}} embossing dies ordered from the London engraver Joseph S. Wyon.The seal dies eventually reached Richmond {{before the end of the}} war. However, due to the risks of running the Union naval blockade imposed upon the Confederacy, the accompanying embossing press was only shipped as far as Bermuda. The dies (crafted in silver) were thus <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> ever <b>have</b> been used in any official capacity.|$|R
50|$|Previous {{residents}} include Colonel H Watts and Mrs Lillian Watts, Mrs Watts was {{the first}} president of the Haslington and Crewe Green branch of the Women’s Institute founded in 1944. Confusion has arisen in several publications with Mrs Madge Watt, a Canadian lady who founded the Women’s Institute in Britain in 1915; she returned to Canada in 1919 and is <b>unlikely</b> ever <b>to</b> <b>have</b> visited Haslington.|$|R
5000|$|Ivar and Ubba are {{identified}} as the commanders of the Danes {{when they returned to}} East Anglia in 869, and as the executioners of the East Anglian king, Edmund the Martyr, for refusing their demand that he renounce Christ. How true the accounts are of Edmund's death is unknown, but {{it has been suggested that}} his capture and execution is not an <b>unlikely</b> thing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> happened.|$|R
5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left on, something that Williamson was <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had been left ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying face down on the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
5|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{sources are}} {{silent on the}} matter, {{it is more than}} likely that on Somairle's demise, his territory was divided amongst his surviving sons. The precise allotment of lands is unknown; even though the division of lands amongst later generations of meic Somairle can be readily discerned, such boundaries are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> existed during the chaotic twelfth century. It is possible that the territory of the first generation of meic Somairle may have stretched from Glenelg in the north, to the Mull of Kintyre in the south; with Áengus ruling in the north, Dubgall centred in Lorne (with possibly the bulk of the inheritance), and Ragnall in Kintyre and the southern islands.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} deep-sea sharks, the Izak {{catshark}} {{has a large}} heart suggestive of a relatively active lifestyle. It is a generalist that feeds {{on a wide variety}} of bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods; larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans and fewer fishes. At least some part of its recorded diet probably represents scavenging from fishery discards, given the presence of fast-moving, pelagic species that the shark is <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> captured live. Polychaete worms, hydrozoans, gastropods, and hagfish eggs may also be occasionally ingested. This species often has nematode and flatworm parasites in its stomach.|$|E
5000|$|Lincecum {{has been}} {{described}} as the most beloved San Francisco sports figure [...] "since Joe Montana", by the Sacramento Bee. Because of his [...] "small size and unorthodox pitching delivery, he is an <b>unlikely</b> figure <b>to</b> <b>have</b> reached the pinnacle of his sport", which the Bee believes reflects the success of the Giants. Fox Sports calls him a [...] "local legend and crowd favorite, now and forever." ...|$|R
5000|$|Entertainment and {{information}} appliances such as: home electronics, TV sets, CD, VCRs and DVD players, camcorders, still cameras, clocks, alarm clocks, video game consoles, HiFi and home cinema, telephones and answering machines {{are classified as}} [...] "brown goods". Some such appliances were traditionally finished with genuine or imitation wood. This has become rare but the name has stuck, even for goods that are <b>unlikely</b> ever <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had a wooden case (e.g. camcorders).|$|R
50|$|The {{court case}} of Everett George Klippert caused much {{discussion}} of homosexuality among Canadians. In 1965 Everett George Klippert was interrogated {{by the police}} {{as part of an}} arson investigation in the Northwest Territories. Klippert was arrested after admitting that he had had sex with other men. When psychiatrists determined that he was <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>having</b> sex with men, he was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to life in prison. Maclean's, Canada's popular newsweekly, then printed an article sympathetic to homosexuals. This led to increasing calls to reform Canada's law on homosexuality. Klippert was released in 1971.|$|R
5|$|Heaphy {{painted a}} variety of {{subjects}} including landscapes, flora and fauna and notable Māori, including the chieftain Te Rauparaha. The success of the company depended on attracting emigrants to New Zealand so his work was almost always intended to present the country and its inhabitants in its best light. Heaphy was at times exposed to some danger; on an expedition to the Chatham Islands, his party intervened in a skirmish between two warring tribes and he {{was wounded in the}} leg. It was <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a serious wound for a few weeks later, he went on a trek back in New Zealand to the Taranaki Region, where he produced some of his more notable landscapes.|$|E
5|$|In 1679 another uncle died {{unexpectedly}} without sons, and Ernest Augustus became reigning Duke of Calenberg-Göttingen, {{with his}} capital at Hanover. George's surviving uncle, George William of Celle, had married his mistress {{in order to}} legitimise his only daughter, Sophia Dorothea, but looked <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> any further children. Under Salic law, where inheritance of territory was restricted to the male line, the succession of George and his brothers to the territories of their father and uncle now seemed secure. In 1682, the family agreed to adopt the principle of primogeniture, meaning George would inherit all the territory {{and not have to}} share it with his brothers.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August AD 14, Augustus {{died while}} visiting Nola {{where his father}} had died. Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that Livia was rumored to have brought about Augustus' death by {{poisoning}} fresh figs. This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustus' life, but some historians view it {{as likely to have}} been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured Postumus as heir, or other of Tiberius' political enemies. Livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been true.|$|E
5000|$|Prepared in February 2011, a Citigroup report {{prepared}} by analysts Willem Buiter (Chief Economist) and Ebrahim Rahbari noted that BRICS (BRIC plus South Africa) countries have [...] "outlived their usefulness". [...] "We hold {{the view that}} categories emerging markets, advanced economies, developing countries, BRICS, Next Eleven or the Growth Markets are all labels belonging to classification schemes that either have outlived their usefulness or are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> ever <b>have</b> any," [...] the two analysts said. So, long run continues growths are important, {{although some of the}} eleven countries identified are poor today and have decades of catch-up growth to look forward to.|$|R
25|$|The {{boundaries}} of the Brussels-Capital Region were determined from the 1947 language census data. This {{was the last time}} that some municipalities were converted from a monolingual Dutch into a bilingual municipality, and were joined with the Brussels agglomeration. The suggestive nature of the questions led massive protest in Flanders (especially around Brussels), causing it <b>to</b> be <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> ever <b>have</b> language-related census data again in Belgium. The result is that the Brussels-Capital region is now a lot smaller than the French influence around the capital, and that there's no place in Brussels for important infrastructure. Enlarging the territory of Brussels could potentially give it around 1.5million inhabitants, an airport, a bigger forest, and bring the Brussels Ringroad on Brussels territory. A large and independent status may help Brussels in its claim as the capital of the EU. However, this is highly <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> happen in the near future.|$|R
50|$|On 6 July 2007, {{the company}} was placed into administration. Kwik Save was left with 56 stores, which were {{transferred}} to a new company called FreshXpress, run by Irish retail entrepreneur Brendan Murtagh. Under the deal all 56 stores stayed open, saving around 600 jobs. Most employees of Kwik Save were <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be paid, <b>having</b> <b>to</b> join other creditors to claim money they were owed from the Official Receiver, unless {{they were part of}} the 56 stores going to FreshXpress.|$|R
5|$|The Life of Saint Edward {{claims that}} while Godwin was in exile Robert {{tried to persuade}} King Edward to divorce Edith, Godwin's daughter, but Edward refused and instead she {{was sent to a}} nunnery. However, the Life is a hagiography, written soon after Edward's death to show Edward as a saint. Thus it {{stresses}} that Edward voluntarily remained celibate, something <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been true and not corroborated by any other source. Modern historians have felt it more likely that Edward, at Robert's urging, wished to divorce Edith and remarry in order to have children to succeed him on the English throne, although it is possible that he merely wished to be rid of her, without necessarily wanting a divorce.|$|E
5|$|The Lānai hookbill is {{only known}} to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe. The type {{specimen}} was caught while feeding on the plant, and its berries were subsequently discovered in its stomach. It is considered likely that the hookbill additionally ate akoko fruits due to their similarity in size and shape to those of the ōpuhe. However, the hookbill's unique bill is considered <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> evolved if the species was purely frugivorous, and {{it has been suggested that}} the hookbill specialized in eating snails. The species was very active while searching for food, constantly flying from tree to tree. While perched it shifted restlessly.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} Domnall's {{rebellion}} {{led to more}} conflict between Earl Harald and King William. After 1187, it appears that Scots and Scotto-Norman nobles were being planted in Ross and in Cromarty, as had previously happened in Moray. The de Moravia family, anglicised as Moray or Murray, which later produced Andrew Moray, were granted lands in Ross and Cromarty, and they are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been unique in this award. When King William fell ill in 1195, {{this may have been}} the catalyst for the final conflict with Harald, which lasted from 1197 until 1201. As part of this struggle, William granted lands in Caithness to Harald the Young, grandson of Rognvald Kali, in 1197. Harald the Young was killed by Harald Maddadsson the following year.|$|E
5000|$|Suture {{complication}}s. The {{most common}} otoplastic complication is suture extrusion in the retroauricular sulcus, (the groove behind the ear). Such extruded sutures {{are easy to}} remove, but the extrusion occurrence might be associated with granulomas, which are painful and unattractive. This complication might be avoided by using absorbable sutures; to which effect, monoﬁlament sutures are likelier <b>to</b> protrude, but <b>have</b> a lesser incidence rate of granulomas; whereas braided sutures are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> protrude, but <b>have</b> a greater incidence rate of granulomas.|$|R
30|$|Where, R {{efficiency}} criterion represents {{the percentage of}} the initial uncertainty explained by the model. The best fitting between measured and predicted values, which is <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> occur, would <b>have</b> RMS =  0 and R =  1. It was found that combination of seven parameters (pH, SO 4, HCO 3, TDS, EC, Mg, and Ca) is the most suitable input variable. Table  3 gives the correlation coefficient (R) and RMS of the prediction based on the different input variables.|$|R
50|$|Gennie gets {{a job at}} the Sharma sweet {{factory and}} begins seeing Bob's son, Jamie (Alex Carter). Gennie and Jamie decide to move to Newquay when they are both offered new jobs. At their leaving party, Bob bids {{farewell}} to Gennie and kisses her on the forehead, which Jamie sees. Jamie accuses them of restarting their affair and tells Viv about it. Jamie tells Gennie that he loves her, but is not sure he can trust her and he leaves for Newquay. Viv slaps Gennie for cheating withis racked with guilt that she never settled to naming him her father. Gennie is promoted to PA at Sharma Sharma, but is offended when she learns that Jai (Chris Bisson) and Nikhil (Rik Makarem) chose her because Jai was <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex with her. Gennie becomes interested in Nikhil and is jealous when he starts seeing Chas. Gennie tells Chas about her crush on Nikhil, which leads to a scuffle. However, Chas dumps Nikhil for Gennie's sake. When Gennie finally confesses her love for Nikhil to him, he rejects her.|$|R
