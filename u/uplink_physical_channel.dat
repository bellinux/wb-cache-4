40|$|The {{performance}} of packet data transmission where several blocks {{are combined together}} into a physical layer frame for simultaneous transmission is studied in this paper. Three hybrid type-II ARQ schemes based upon HRO-RCPC codes are presented and their throughput is investigated on Rayleigh fading channels with different block lengths. The simulation results show that scheme 5 1 has the best performance and that there exists an optimum range of block size. To implement scheme 5 in our frame composition, three basic scheduling mechanisms are proposed and evaluated and the conclusion shows that an appropriate scheduling discipline may be employed for the different specific service requirements.

Note {{that the}} Uplink control information consists only on DL acknowledges {{as well as}} CQI related reports as all the UL coding and allocation parameters are known by the network side and signaled to the UE in the PDCCH.|$|R
30|$|ICIC is a SON function, {{which aims}} to {{minimize}} interference among cells using the same spectrum. It involves the coordination of physical resources between neighboring cells to reduce interference from one cell to another. ICIC {{can be done in}} both uplink and downlink for the data <b>channels</b> <b>physical</b> downlink shared <b>channel</b> (PDSCH) and <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> shared <b>channel</b> (PUSCH) or <b>uplink</b> control <b>channel</b> <b>physical</b> downlink control <b>channel</b> (PDCCH). ICIC can be static, semi-static, or dynamic. Dynamic ICIC relies on frequent adjustments of parameters, supported by signaling among cells over X 2 interface. To support proactive coordination among cells, the high interference indicator (HII) and the relative narrowband transmit power (RNTP) indicators have been defined, while to support reactive coordination, the overload indicator (OI) has been introduced [33]. Parameters that may be tuned are the transmission power, the pilot power, antenna parameters (azimuth and tilt), and the support of coordinated almost blank subframes (ABS).|$|R
30|$|The PRB {{allocation}} of the <b>Physical</b> <b>Uplink</b> Control <b>Channel</b> (PUCCH) is known a priori {{as defined by}} the standards. The UL control signaling on this channel is transmitted in a frequency region on the edges of the system BW. In parallel, the PRB {{allocation of}} other essential UL control channels, such as the RACH, can be extracted from the SIB messages.|$|R
30|$|LTE uplink {{has adopted}} SC-FDMA[20]. The {{bandwidth}} {{is divided into}} subbands which are called physical resource blocks (PRBs). The PRB defines the resource allocation granularity in LTE. Herein, a transmission bandwidth of 10 MHz is allocated for uplink and thus there are 48 PRBs available for data transmission on the <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> shared <b>channel</b> (PUSCH) and 2 PRBs are reserved to the uplink control channel.|$|R

30|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of CQI/PMI feedback mechanisms defined in the time domain: periodic and aperiodic. The RI is always a frequency nonselective type feedback and {{is associated with the}} corresponding CQI/PMI feedback. The supported time-frequency CQI/PMI feedback granularities determine the overall feedback amount, and the supported configurations depend on the <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> <b>channel</b> utilized. The aperiodic feedback—frequency selective—is supported on the uplink shared channel and is available only when the UE has downlink/uplink transmission scheduled while for the periodic feedback—frequency non/selective—both uplink control and shared channels can be used [13].|$|R
30|$|In LTE networks, each UE {{performs}} {{random access}} (RA) procedures to transmit data during the access grant time interval (AGTI) or RA slots over a time-frequency radio resource called <b>physical</b> random access <b>channel</b> (PRACH). A UE initiates the RA mechanism in two cases [42]. Firstly, when a UE {{is turned on}} and the uplink timing synchronization is either lost or not yet achieved. Secondly, whenever a handover mechanism is performed from a serving eNB to a target eNB. In LTE, UEs perform the RA procedure for several reasons such as for establishing a communication link, re-initiating a radio link after a failure, for radio resources in case of no uplink resource grant, and scheduling requests {{in the absence of}} dedicated <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> control <b>channels</b> (PUCCHs).|$|R

40|$|To fully {{exploit the}} {{potential}} of a wideband CDMA-based mobile Internet computing system, an efficient algorithm is needed for judiciously performing rate allocation, so as to orchestrate and allocate bandwidth for voice services and high data rate applications. However, in existing standards (e. g., cdma 2000), only a first-come-first-served equal sharing allocation algorithm is used, potentially leading to a low bandwidth utilization and inadequate support of high data rate multimedia mobile applications (e. g., video/audio files swapping, multimedia messaging services, etc.). In this paper, we first analytically model the rate allocation problem that captures realistic system constraints such as downlink power limits and control, <b>uplink</b> Interference effects, <b>physical</b> <b>channel</b> adaptation, and soft handoff. We then suggest six efficient rate allocation schemes that are designed based on different philosophies: rate optimal, fairness-based, and user-oriented.

30|$|Uplink {{power control}} {{has a strong}} impact on the {{performance}} of mobile communication networks. In this work, an automatic parameter planning algorithm for the standardized power control scheme in the <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> shared <b>channel</b> (PUSCH) of long term evolution LTE is proposed. The method is conceived for the network design stage, when network measurements are still not available. The proposed heuristic algorithm can handle irregular scenarios at a low computational complexity. For this purpose, the parameter planning problem in a cell is formulated analytically through the combination of multiple regular scenarios built on a per-adjacency basis. Method assessment is carried out over a static system-level simulator implementing a real scenario. Results show that the proposed method can improve average user throughput and cell-edge user throughput when compared to current vendor approaches, which provide network-wide uniform parameter settings.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we propose the use of Timed Coloured Petri Nets for the Performance Evaluation of Hardware/Software systems for DSP applications.

However, the verification of the suitability of a system configuration can usually be performed only after the integration of the hardware and software components, when design modifications and optimizations are particularly expensive. This article proposes a framework to evaluate the performance of HW/SW systems in which Timed Coloured Petri Nets can be exploited in the early phases of the design.

40|$|We {{study the}} uplink control {{signaling}} in 3 GPP-Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems.

We derive optimal detectors for both the conventional method and the proposed precoding method for different cases of channel state information (CSI) and noise variance information at the receiver. With a single receive antenna, the proposed method offers significant gains compared to the coding currently used in 3 GPP-LTE for all the different scenarios considered in this work.

40|$|AbstractRealization of {{transmitter}} {{and receiver}} architecture for LTE is the major research work being carried out by implementation experts. There are four Control channels available in LTE for both uplink and downlink. The uplink control channel is PUCCH. The downlink control channels are PDCCH, PCFICH and PHICH. The Physical Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) Indicator Channel(PHICH) is the control channel which carries the acknowledgement (ACK/NACK), denoted as Hybrid ARQ Indicator(HI). These control channels {{play a key role}} in the correct decoding of the payload information. The HI is used to indicate the ACK for data sent using <b>Physical</b> <b>Uplink</b> Shared <b>Channel</b> (PUSCH), and is important for the system performance. In this paper, the realization of architecture for the PHICH are done using FPGA, where the main aim is to estimate the HI correctly in the receiver side.

40|$|We propose {{improvements}} for the <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> control <b>channel</b> (PUCCH) format 2 control signaling in 3 GPP-LTE systems. These improvements can {{be useful}} for low-cost UE design and optimization planned for the future LTE releases. In the proposed method, instead of repeating a single QPSK symbol across the 12 subcarriers in each OFDM symbol of a resource block as done in the current release of the standard, we pick two QPSK symbols from two independent resource blocks and repeat them across 6 subcarriers each. The proposed method has a performance gain of about 5. 5 dB and 1. 85 dB over the conventional method with one and two receiving antennas at the base station, respectively. These gains can be achieved {{without the use of}} any additional transmission power, time-frequency resources or receiver complexity. The cell-specific QPSK sequences specified in the standard for PUCCH transmission are chosen according to the conventional repetition across the 12 subcarriers, hence we suggest new cell-specific QPSK sequences which minimize the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of the PUCCH signal with the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|Advanced Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (Advanced E-UTRA), called LTE-Advanced, {{has been}} {{standardized}} in the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) {{as a candidate}} for IMT-Advanced. LTE-Advanced supports spatial orthogonal-resource transmit diversity (SORTD) [1], [2] for ACK/NACK signals and scheduling requests (SRs), which are used to control downlink hybrid automatic repeat requests (HARQs) and manage uplink radio resources based on uplink data traffic, respectively. Both ACK/NACK signals and SRs are carried via a <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> control <b>channel</b> (PUCCH) [3], and a common PUCCH format is used for both ACK/NACK signals and SRs. If SORTD is used, the base station assigns mutually orthogonal resources to each antenna included in the user equipment (UE) for ACK/NACK signals and SRs; hence, the number of required resources increases with the number of transmitting antennas in the UE. In this paper, we study the resource reduction method for ACK/NACK signal and SR in case of SORTD using the concept of common resource. In addition, we investigate a phase rotation scheme for common resources to improve the SR detection performance...|$|R
40|$|Uplink Power Control (ULPC) is a {{key feature}} of mobile networks. Particularly, in LTE, <b>Physical</b> <b>Uplink</b> Shared <b>Channel</b> (PUSCH) {{performance}} strongly depends on Uplink Power Control configuration. In this work, a methodology for the self-planning of uplink Fractional Power Control (FPC) settings is presented. Values for nominal power and channel path-loss compensation factor are proposed. The method is designed for the planning and operational (replanning) stages. A very fast solution for FPC setting {{can be achieved by}} the combination of several simple solutions obtained by assuming some simplifications. First, the FPC planning problem is formulated analytically on a cell basis through the combination of multiple regular scenarios built on a per-adjacency basis from a live scenario. Secondly, detailed inspection of the FPC parameter values aims to identify the most important variables in the scenario impacting optimal FPC settings. Finally, regression equations can be built based on those key variables for a simple FPC parameter calculation, so computational costs are extremely reduced. Results show that network performance with the proposed FPC parameter settings is good when compared with typical FPC configurations from operators...|$|R
40|$|LTE is a next {{generation}} mobile {{system from the}} 3 GPP {{with a focus on}} wireless broadband. The aim of LTE is to achieve high data rates in both uplink & downlink, and to achieve high spectral efficiencies. The main focus of the work is to develop baseband algorithms in the uplink in order to achieve uplinksynchronization between the user and the base station and also for the detection of the control data that is transmitted. For the base station to obtain the knowledge of the presence of the user and also about its position, the user has to transmit synchronization signals to the base station, which are transmitted on the <b>Physical</b> Random Access <b>CHannel</b> (PRACH) in LTE. These signals are used to obtain the uplink timing correction and hence synchronize with the base station. It is very important for the base station to detect the control data that has been transmitted by the user on <b>Physical</b> <b>Uplink</b> Control <b>CHannel</b> (PUCCH). The control data may consist of the response of the UE to the data packets that were transmitted by the base station, request for resource allocation etc. So efficient algorithms are necessary for the accurate detection of the control data at the base station. The current work presents algorithms that are essential for obtaining uplink synchronization and also for efficient detection of the control channel data...|$|R
30|$|In case of more bursty data traffic, like web-browsing, the {{feedback}} {{information can be}} sent between the different data bursts only on the <b>Physical</b> <b>Uplink</b> Control <b>Channel</b> (PUCCH). Because of the limited capacity of the PUCCH, {{the feedback}} information can be sent typcially every 20, 40 or even 80 ms only, depending {{on the number of}} mobile stations in a radio cell. Therefore, inaccurate or even outdated feedback information {{at the start of a}} data burst—especially in combination with the so-called ‘TCP slow start’ effect—can result in a reduced user throughput [11]. In order to mitigate these effects in case of a high number of mobile stations like in machine-to-machine scenarios, the feedback information is sent automatically less frequently, e.g. only every 80 ms, in case of a low mobility environment. Otherwise, the capacity of the PUCCH has to be increased automatically, which results in a reduced capacity of the PUSCH in turn. Alternatively, part of the traffic can be offloaded either in a micro or pico cell of a heterogeneous network or in a macro cell of another frequency layer. Only for fast-moving mobile stations like trains the transmission has to be downgraded to the more robust transmisson modes like TM 3 or even TM 2.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, Machine-Type Communications (MTC) {{has become}} one of the most {{attractive}} technologies in the area of wireless networking. Different sources are predicting a large grow of smart grid machine-to-machine deployments in several decades, which also means that the total number of wireless devices will increase dramatically. In connection to this problem, the choice of the standard, which will satisfy all the MTC requirements without harming current wireless deployments has become very relevant. Because of these reasons, many companies are proposing to modify one (or several) of the current wireless standard in a way that it will be possible to use for MTC purposes. This will be perfect from point of view of interference problems, because they will be already included in a standard itself. Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE- A) is one of the most rapidly developing wireless technologies, that seems to be an ideal candidate for future MTC implementation. However, while the capacity of typical LTE-A network should be enough to satisfy trafﬁc demands of large number of MTC devices, the signaling is not ready to face new requirements.
