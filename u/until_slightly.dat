50|$|GAD65 and GAD67 {{synthesize}} GABA {{at different}} {{locations in the}} cell, at different developmental times, and for functionally different purposes. GAD67 is spread evenly throughout the cell while GAD65 is localized to nerve terminals. This difference is thought to reflect a functional difference; GAD67 synthesizes GABA for neuron activity unrelated to neurotransmission, such as synaptogenesis and protection from neural injury. This function requires widespread, ubiquitous presence of GABA. GAD65, however, synthesizes GABA for neurotransmission, and therefore is only necessary at nerve terminals and synapses. In order to aid in neurotransmission, GAD65 forms a complex with Heat Shock Cognate 70 (HSC70), cysteine string protein (CSP) and Vesicular GABA transporter VGAT, which, as a complex, helps package GABA into vesicles for release during neurotransmission. GAD67 is transcribed during early development, while GAD65 is not transcribed until later in life. This developmental difference in GAD67 and GAD65 reflects the functional properties of each isoform; GAD67 is needed throughout development for normal cellular functioning, while GAD65 is not needed <b>until</b> <b>slightly</b> later in development when synaptic inhibition is more prevalent.|$|E

The sequence consists of three segments. Between the Upper Jurassic and the Lower Cretaceous, segment "A" comprises intervals of short duration, with a mean duration of about 0. 29 My, and no clear long-term evolution. Segment "B" begins around 130 Ma, displays a sudden increase of the duration of the magnetic intervals, an interval of maximum duration, the normal Cretaceous superchron, and a long and erratic sequence of inteivals with decreasing average duration between 85 Ma and about 25 Ma. From 25 Ma to the present, segment "C" consists of intei-vais of short duration with a mean value of 0. 23 My. This description suggests that the Earth's magnetic field could have experienced a fairly stationary regime <b>until</b> <b>slightly</b> befoie the onset of the Cretaceous superchron, when the regime has been rapidly and strongly perturbed before progressively returning to another stationary regime about 25 Ma ago.

40|$|International audienceIn this study, the {{activation}} of H 2 O 2 and persulfate ions induced by solar photolysis of Fe(III) EDDS complex were investigated in water disinfection, applying solar AOPs processes. The use of Fe(III) EDDS complex maintains iron in soluble form <b>until</b> <b>slightly</b> basic pH {{and so the}} photolysis is efficient in a large range of pH compatible with natural waters. Moreover, for the first time, the impact of photogenerated hydroxyl and sulfate radicals on the inactivation of Enterococcus faecalis in water was studied. E. faecalis was proposed as alternative model microorganism given its higher resistance than the commonly used E. coli. The reactivity of hydroxyl radicals {{seems to be more}} efficient for the inactivation of such strain than the reactivity of sulfate radicals. Moreover, experimental results show that the concentration of Fe(III) EDDS complex is a key parameter for the inactivation of microrganisms. For the direct application in natural waters, the efficiency of the process in the presence of ubiquitous inorganic compounds, such as carbonate (HCO 3 −/CO 32 −) and chloride ions (Cl−), was also investigated. Carbonates showed a strong reduction on the E. faecalis inactivation in all cases; meanwhile chloride ions enhanced the inactivation in the presence of persulfate as also shown by using a complementary kinetic modeling approach. A dual role of Fe(III) EDDS complex was established and discussed; essential for the generation of radical species but a trap for the reactivity of these same radicals...|$|E
40|$|During the 1980 s and 1990 s, Salmonella {{serotype}} Enteritidis (SE) {{emerged as}} an important cause of human illness in the United States. The rate of SE isolates reported to CDC increased from 0. 6 per 100, 000 population in 1976 to 3. 6 per 100, 000 in 1996 (Figure 1). Case-control studies of sporadic infections and outbreak investigations found that this increase was associated with eating raw or undercooked shell eggs (1). From 1996 to 1998, the rate of culture-confirmed SE cases reported to CDC declined to 2. 2 per 100, 000; however, outbreaks of illness caused by SE continue to occur. This report describes four SE outbreaks during 1996 – 1998 associated with eating raw or undercooked shell eggs and discusses measures that may be contributing to the decline in culture-confirmed SE cases.
