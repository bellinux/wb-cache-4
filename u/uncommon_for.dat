5|$|A {{number of}} citrus plants yield pressed oils. Some, such as lemon and orange oil, {{are used as}} {{essential}} oils, which is <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> pressed oils. The seeds of many if not {{most members of the}} citrus family yield usable oils.|$|E
5|$|Funerals {{among the}} Antankarana are often celebratory events. Among villagers living near the sea, {{it is not}} <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> {{the remains of a}} loved one to be placed in a coffin which the family carries running into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It is not <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now {{more likely to be}} recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E

5|$|Research into BZP's {{tolerance}} is sparse. Anecdotal {{evidence from}} online sources claim tolerance {{to the central}} action of BZP will develop quickly.

5|$|The {{spread of}} {{pancreatic}} cancer to other organs (metastasis) may also cause symptoms. Typically, pancreatic adenocarcinoma first spreads to nearby lymph nodes, {{and later to}} the liver or to the peritoneal cavity, large intestine or lungs. It is <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> it to spread to the bones or brain.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{regional}} varieties {{of the standard}} language that are specific to geographical areas of varying size (regions, historical provinces, cities, towns, etc.). In mass media {{it is no longer}} <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> journalists to speak with a distinct regional accent, but the most common pronunciation and the one perceived as the most formal is still Central Standard Swedish.|$|E

5|$|There was {{significant}} rivalry for frequencies among Pirate stations, fuelled {{by the financial}} rewards that came from promoting raves, and as a consequence, it was not <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> some stations to attack or destroy the transmitters and/or studios of their rivals for airtime.|$|E

5|$|Bears, crocodiles, golden jackals, leopards {{and snakes}} {{are the main}} predators of the jungle cat. The golden jackal, particularly, can be a major {{competitor}} to the cat. When it encounters a threat, the jungle cat will vocalise before engaging in attack, producing sounds like small roars – a behavior <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> {{the other members of}} Felis. The meow of the jungle cat is also somewhat lower than that of a typical domestic cat. The jungle cat can host parasites such as Haemaphysalis and Heterophyes species.|$|E

5|$|Each team in {{the league}} has a manager, who is {{responsible}} for team strategy and leadership on and off the field. Assisted by various coaches, the manager sets the line-up and starting pitcher before each game, and makes substitutions throughout the game. In early baseball history, it was not <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> players to fill multiple roles as player-managers; specifically, they managed the team while still being signed to play for the club. The last player-manager in Major League Baseball was Pete Rose, who began managing the Cincinnati Reds in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Eva Perón {{spent her}} {{childhood}} in Junín, Buenos Aires province. Her father, Juan Duarte, was descended from French Basque immigrants, meanwhile her mother Juana Ibarguren, was descended from Spanish Basque immigrants. Juan Duarte, a wealthy rancher from nearby Chivilcoy, {{already had a}} wife and family there. At that time in rural Argentina, it was not <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> a wealthy man to have multiple families.|$|E
5|$|Mistle thrushes {{are found}} as {{individuals}} or pairs {{for much of}} the year, although families forage together in late summer, and groups may merge to form flocks of several tens of birds; it is not <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year. They roost at night in trees or bushes, again typically as individuals or pairs, but with families roosting together in autumn.|$|E

5|$|Teams {{have the}} option of trading their picks to other teams in {{exchange}} for different picks, players, money, or a combination thereof. It is not <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades. Of the players selected in each draft and throughout its history, East Carolina has had 63 players picked.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} its western border {{running along the}} Finland–Norway border. The two most {{prominent}} lakes are Ellenvatn and Ødevatn, both of which flow into tributaries of the river Pasvikelva. The fauna and flora are typical of the Siberian taiga, and include some species <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> Norway. The park is a habitat for the brown bear and also has a large population of moose; reindeer husbandry takes place during winter. Eight species of fish live in the lakes and the park has 190 species of flowering plants.|$|E
5|$|Tisdale {{testified to}} passing the order by {{telephone}} to Blue River and to Red Pass Junction, {{and that it}} was correctly read back to him by both operators. He also testified to a brief gap in communications several days before the crash, saying that in the rough country through which the railway line passed it was not <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> objects falling against the communication line to cause brief outages. Parsons also testified that Atherton had correctly repeated back the order.|$|E

5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also not <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (or too much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the scores from the first round – if completed – are used to determine the final result. This is called a single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, if one of the two competitions is cancelled, the final result will be based on the competition that took place.|$|E
5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore it is not <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E
5|$|Another theory, {{which was}} {{put forward by}} early Serbian historians and has {{subsequently}} lost support in Serbian scholarship, is that despot Michael is {{to be identified with}} mid-15th-century Serbian noble Mihailo Anđelović, a brother of Ottoman statesman Mahmud Pasha Angelović. However, in-depth research of the frecoes has concluded that they cannot be ascribed to the 1450s, as the artistic style, the clothing and hairstyles in the portraits are <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> this period. Furthermore, the church seems to bear little architectural similarity to churches of the Morava school, which dominated 15th-century Serbian architecture. It has also been revealed that in 1454–1455, Donja Kamenica was controlled by the Ottomans and in possession of a certain Yusuf, rather than part of the Serbian Despotate, and Mihailo Anđelović was never titled despot.|$|E
