5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip <b>unnecessary</b> objects from his life and <b>unnecessary</b> words from his prose.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that swaraj {{not only can}} be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence. Military is <b>unnecessary,</b> because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While military is <b>unnecessary</b> in a nation organised under swaraj principle, Gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature. However, the state would limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, the {{government}} agreed {{that a second}} pier could be built, despite objections from the Blackpool Pier Company that {{it was close to}} their pier and therefore <b>unnecessary.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1942, the Airborne Command {{requested}} a version with removable trails. A prototype was tested, but in 1943 {{the project was}} dropped as <b>unnecessary.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later {{that year}} Koniecpolski {{returned}} to Pomerania {{to prepare for}} another war against Sweden, but it was rendered <b>unnecessary</b> by the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś.|$|E
5|$|Prolactinomas {{may respond}} to {{dopamine}} agonist treatment–medication that mimics {{the action of}} dopamine on the lactrotrope cells, usually bromocriptine or cabergoline. This approach may improve pituitary hormone secretion {{in more than half}} the cases, and make supplementary treatment <b>unnecessary.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of sleep {{is not fully}} understood, but there is evidence it allows for metabolic waste {{to be removed from}} the brain, and may permit repair. It may also have a cognitive function, weakening <b>unnecessary</b> connections.|$|E
5|$|A common {{complaint}} was the noticeable digital airbrushing on numerous close-up shots of Jovovich's face, for which reviewers were confused at the use of, or found <b>unnecessary.</b> The film won the Golden Trailer Award for Best Action Poster and {{was nominated for}} Best TV Spot.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{pioneering}} efforts by Olav Selvaag and others, archaic and otherwise <b>unnecessary</b> restrictions were relaxed, improving opportunities for more Norwegians to build housing to suit their individual needs and preferences. Norwegians often undertake home improvement projects on their own, and many have built most of their own homes.|$|E
5|$|Beach Thomas {{was opposed}} {{to the use of}} the toothed steel trap for {{catching}} rabbits, supporting the RSPCA in its efforts to outlaw the device and noting that it both inflicted <b>unnecessary</b> pain and was indiscriminate in nature, sometimes trapping other animals such as domesticated cattle and pet dogs.|$|E
5|$|Between 1853 and 1862, {{there were}} a number of uprisings against the Brooke {{government}} but all were successfully contained with the aid of local tribes. To guard against future uprisings, a series of forts were constructed to protect Kuching, including Fort Margherita, completed in 1871. By that time Brooke's control of Sarawak was such that defences were largely <b>unnecessary.</b>|$|E
5|$|By June 1942, Royal Navy commanders {{considered}} that camouflage was largely <b>unnecessary,</b> {{given that the}} enemy would be using RDF and submarine hydrophones. In April 1943, the Admiralty decided that diffused lighting was impractical, and development was halted, though discussions continued with the Canadian Navy.|$|E
5|$|Chicago {{tight end}} John Gilmore picked up Vinatieri's {{bouncing}} kickoff {{and returned it}} 9-yards to his own 45-yard line, with an <b>unnecessary</b> roughness penalty on Mathis adding another 15yards and giving the Bears a first down on the Colts' 40-yard line. Chicago could only gain 14yards on their ensuing possession, {{but it was enough}} for Robbie Gould to make a 44-yard field goal, cutting the score to 22–17.|$|E
5|$|Complaints of {{low back}} pain {{are one of the}} most common reasons people visit doctors. For pain that has lasted only a few weeks, the pain is likely to subside on its own. Thus, if a person's medical history and {{physical}} examination do not suggest a specific disease as the cause, medical societies advise against imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Individuals may want such tests but, unless red flags are present, they are <b>unnecessary</b> health care. Routine imaging increases costs, is associated with higher rates of surgery with no overall benefit, and the radiation used may be harmful to one's health. Fewer than 1% of imaging tests identify the cause of the problem. Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities, encouraging people to request further <b>unnecessary</b> testing or to worry. Even so, MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300% among United States Medicare beneficiaries from 1994 to 2006.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{opening to}} {{positive}} {{reception at the}} 2010 Cannes Film Festival, Money Never Sleeps received polarized reviews from critics, who generally praised the acting, but considered it an <b>unnecessary</b> sequel. Though failing to meet its critical expectations, the film was successful at the box office, topping the United States's ranking during its opening weekend, and earning a worldwide total of $134 million in ticket sales, and more than $15 million on DVD.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{also took}} place in 2005, near the {{marketplace}} of the Bucharest neighborhood Rahova. The chosen area raised a few difficulties related to safety. However, the production benefited from its picturesque view, rendering the scenography and the original music <b>unnecessary.</b> The omnipresent manele also {{found their way into}} the movie, as background music.|$|E
5|$|Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) {{can be used}} to biopsy bone lesions, {{once found}} on an X-ray or other scan. Such tests can be vital in diagnosis and can also prevent <b>unnecessary</b> treatment and invasive surgery. Conversely, FNA biopsy of tumors of the parathyroid gland is not recommended for diagnosing parathyroid carcinoma and may in fact be harmful, as the needle can puncture the tumor, leading to dissemination and the possible spread of cancerous cells.|$|E
5|$|Fleance {{appears in}} Shakespeare's Macbeth. However, only his {{childhood}} is portrayed; {{the rest of}} his story, as it is described in Holinshed's Chronicles, does not appear in Shakespeare's play. Scholars suggest that Shakespeare does not elaborate on Fleance's life after his escape from Scotland to avoid <b>unnecessary</b> distraction from the story of Macbeth himself.|$|E
5|$|He {{has pledged}} never {{to raise taxes}} and states he has never voted to approve a budget deficit. Paul {{believes}} that the country could abolish the individual income tax by scaling back federal spending to its fiscal year 2000 levels; financing government operations would be primarily by excise taxes and non-protectionist tariffs. He endorses eliminating most federal government agencies, terming them <b>unnecessary</b> bureaucracies.|$|E
5|$|In the 1570s, {{a survey}} {{recommended}} that four brass artillery guns be kept at the castle. The range of artillery guns soon increased, however, making it <b>unnecessary</b> to have armed forts {{on both sides}} of the river and, by the end of the 16th century, the castle's military utility had lessened and it was not normally manned.|$|E
5|$|Justice Powell, {{after setting}} forth {{the facts of}} the case, {{discussed}} and found it <b>unnecessary</b> to decide whether Bakke had a private right of action under Title VI, assuming that was so for purposes of the case. He then discussed the scope of Title VI, opining that it barred only those racial classifications forbidden by the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium {{can finally}} be {{separated}} from the other trivalent actinides using selective elution from a cation-exchange resin column, the eluant being ammonia α-HIB. Using the gas-jet method often renders the first two steps <b>unnecessary.</b> The above procedure is the most commonly used one for the separation of transeinsteinium elements.|$|E
5|$|Merchants and peasant farmers paid {{property}} and poll taxes in coin cash and land taxes with {{a portion of}} their crop yield. Peasants obtained coinage by working as hired laborers for rich landowners, in businesses like breweries or by selling agricultural goods and homemade wares at urban markets. The Han government may have found collecting taxes in coin the easiest method because the transportation of taxed goods would have been <b>unnecessary.</b>|$|E
5|$|Militarily, it is {{difficult}} to draw many lessons from Salamis, because of the uncertainty about what actually happened. Once again the Allies chose their ground well in order to negate Persian numbers, but this time (unlike Thermopylae) had to rely on the Persians launching an <b>unnecessary</b> attack for their position to count. (Hale, John R.).|$|E
5|$|Other {{investigations}} (such {{as blood}} tests and viral culture) are discouraged, {{as they may}} cause <b>unnecessary</b> agitation and thus worsen the stress on the compromised airway. While viral cultures, obtained via nasopharyngeal aspiration, {{can be used to}} confirm the exact cause, these are usually restricted to research settings. Bacterial infection should be considered if a person does not improve with standard treatment, at which point further investigations may be indicated.|$|E
5|$|Proof of {{specific}} intent to endanger life is <b>unnecessary</b> {{on a charge}} of attempting this offence. In Attorney General's Reference No. 3 of 1992 (1994), {{on a charge of}} attempted aggravated arson, it was held to be sufficient for the prosecution to establish a specific intent to cause damage by fire and that the defendant was reckless as to whether life would thereby be endangered.|$|E
5|$|Rōjaku (老弱): Rō means old, and jaku means {{tranquil}} and quiet. Rōjaku is {{the final}} stage of performance development of the Noh actor, in which he eliminates all <b>unnecessary</b> action or sound in the performance, leaving only the true essence of the scene or action being imitated.|$|E
5|$|Several {{designs for}} new castles emerged that made keeps <b>unnecessary.</b> One such design was the {{concentric}} approach, involving exterior walls guarded with towers, and perhaps supported by further, concentric layered defenses: thus castles such as Framlingham {{never had a}} central keep. Military factors may well have driven this development: R. Brown, for example, suggests that designs with a separate keep and bailey system inherently lacked a co-ordinated and combined defensive system, and that once bailey walls were sophisticated enough, a keep became militarily <b>unnecessary.</b> In England, gatehouses were also growing in size and sophistication until they too challenged {{the need for a}} keep in the same castle. The classic Edwardian gatehouse, with two large, flanking towers and multiple portcullises, designed to be defended from attacks both within and outside the main castle, has been often compared to the earlier Norman keeps: some of the largest gatehouses are called gatehouse keeps for this reason.|$|E
5|$|She was {{modified}} at Chatham Dockyard {{for use as}} a target ship between 6 December 1920 and 8 April 1921. The ship was rewired for radio control and stripped; the 12-inch turrets remained aboard, but all of her guns and their equipment were removed, as were her torpedo equipment, flying deck, sea cabins, main derrick and boat equipment, lower conning tower, masts and yards, most of her crew amenities, and other <b>unnecessary</b> equipment. <b>Unnecessary</b> hatches, coamings, scuttles, and lifts were removed and plated over, and she was ballasted differently than she had been as a battleship. It was not intended to sink her, so she was assigned a crew of 153 to maintain and operate her when she was not under fire.|$|E
5|$|Sherman's {{second term}} also saw his first speeches in Congress on the country's {{financial}} situation, {{which had been}} harmed by the Panic of 1857. Citing the need to pare <b>unnecessary</b> expenditures in light of diminished revenue, Sherman especially criticized Southern senators for adding appropriations to the House's bills. His speech attracted attention and {{was the start of}} Sherman's focus on financial matters, which would continue throughout his long political career.|$|E
5|$|The City Planning Commission {{ended up}} not favoring a line via Utica Avenue, {{feeling that it}} was <b>unnecessary</b> with the Nostrand Avenue Line {{extension}} {{and the lack of}} available funds. Instead it suggested that the BMT Canarsie Line extension be built instead.|$|E
5|$|The Equal Protection Clause {{requires}} {{each state}} to provide equal {{protection under the}} law to all people, including all non-citizens, within its jurisdiction. This clause has been the basis for many decisions rejecting irrational or <b>unnecessary</b> discrimination against people belonging to various groups.|$|E
5|$|The Muppets' Wizard of Oz premiered on April 27, 2005 at the Tribeca Film Festival. The film's {{television}} premiere {{was broadcast}} on ABC on May 20, 2005, {{as the final}} ABC Movie of the Week. The film received generally mixed to negative reviews from critics, who felt that the film was too mature for young audiences and that the cameo scenes and popular culture references were <b>unnecessary.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It serves as a satire of pop culture criticism, and mocks people who find hidden messages in works which are ironically <b>unnecessary.</b> The episode includes other themes, including the lack of interest in reading among American youths, and even mocks the idea that a book alone can inspire someone into committing violent crimes.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} positive {{attention from}} film critics. The Morning Telegraph praised {{it as the}} best work from the new Thanhouser Company. The The New York Dramatic Mirror found it to have good acting which could still be more expressive, but was more indifferent {{to the use of}} <b>unnecessary</b> connecting scenes. The Moving Picture World stated, in a brief review, that the acting and photography was good.|$|E
5|$|The journal has {{developed}} {{standards for the}} publication of mouse mutant studies. Many mouse mutant studies have serious methodological problems leading to fatally flawed scientific conclusions, causing a waste of time, effort, and research resources, and leading to ethical problems because of the <b>unnecessary</b> use of live animals for flawed studies. These standards are gradually being accepted more widely in the field.|$|E
