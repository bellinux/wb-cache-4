40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the association of <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> with post-purchase regret, moderated by consumer-family income and gender, as well as the association of both sales promotion and bank- card payment with <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> in the Saudi market. Drawing on <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> and post-purchase literature, the study tested a model of post-purchase regret. A survey was conducted among Saudi consumers of retail stores in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A convenience sample of 927 respondents was taken for data collection, among them 903 were finalized for analysis. The study concluded that there is a positive relationship between <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> and post-purchase regret. An increased association of <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> with post-purchase regret has been found among low-income earners and male consumers. Furthermore, bank-card payment, but not sales promotion, has a significant association with <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying.</b> Practically, consumers and marketers can benefit from the results and recommendations of this study, both avoiding the bad consequences of post-purchase regret. Self-awareness of the factors that cause regret may turn consumers to be more rational in their future buying decisions. Marketers’ perceptions of those factors may also be helpful in setting marketing strategies towards their target markets; satisfying, and retaining consumers. The original contribution of this study comes from a lack of research in the Middle East on <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying,</b> post-purchase regret and their relationship antecedents. </p...|$|E
40|$|Many {{retailers}} {{believe that}} a majority of purchases are unplanned, so they spend heavily on in-store marketing to stimulate these types of purchases. At the same time, the effects of “preshopping ” factors—the shoppers ’ overall trip goals, store-specific shopping objectives, and prior marketing exposures—are largely unexplored. The authors focus on these out-of-store drivers and, unlike prior research, use panel data to “hold the shopper constant ” while estimating unbiased trip-level effects. Thus, they uncover opportunities for retailers to generate more <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> from existing shoppers. The authors find that the amount of <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> increases monotonically with the abstractness of the overall shopping trip goal that is established before the shopper enters the store. Store-linked goals also affect unplanned buying; <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> is higher on trips in which the shopper chooses the store for favorable pricing and lower on trips in which the shopper chooses the store as part of a multistore shopping trip. Although out-of-store marketing has no direct effect, it reinforces the lift in <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> from shoppers who use marketing materials inside the store.

40|$|Unplanned/impulse {{purchases}} form {{a considerable}} portion of grocery and retailing sales. Due {{to the economic}} importance of this phenomenon, retailers invest substantially in in-store marketing to encourage consumers to engage {{in this type of}} shopping; while public policy makers and consumer advocates seek to reduce it; and over the last few decades researchers have explored the potential factors associated with its occurrence. Prior research finds that <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> is reactive behaviour and often involves an immediate action response to a stimulus. The stimuli can be internal (based on inner psychological states) or external (based on environmental cues) and can cause emotional responses which lead to different decisions and behaviours among consumers. While there has been extensive research into the nature and determinants of unplanned purchase behaviour, there is still little understanding of how emotional factors influence this behaviour. Drawing from emotion regulation theory, this research aims to investigate how consumers’ unplanned purchase behaviour is shaped by emotional components (valence and arousal) that occur in response to in-store stimuli. Also, the role of type of the planned product, in particular whether the product is predominantly hedonic or utilitarian is investigated. By including all these factors in one study, this research delivers advantages over preceding studies, which considered the effects of only one of the components of emotion at the time (either valence or arousal) on <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying.</b> The empirical part of the thesis consists of four scenario-based experiments conducted in a behavioural lab using over eight hundred participants in total. The experiments unobtrusively manipulated consumers’ emotional states through exposure to movie clips that form part of a shopping scenario. The scenarios allowed direct observation of the extent of <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying.</b> Findings in general show that consumers’ unplanned purchase behaviour depends on the specific combination of current levels of valence and arousal. The results of the first two experiments demonstrate that the effects of arousal and valence are interdependent and that neither can singly explain the <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> behaviour process. This suggests that if participants are in a pleasant emotional state they display greater levels of <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> when they are aroused than when they are not aroused, while the reverse holds when they feel unpleasant. The results of the second and third experiments replicate the findings from the earlier experiments and provide strong additional support for the prediction that consumers’ <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> behaviour it a joint function of their current level of arousal and valence. Besides, the findings show that the effects of affect on consumer <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> behaviour also depend on the type of planned item. The findings suggest that the interaction of valence and arousal is no longer significant when consumers had hedonic choices on their shopping list. In contrast, when they are in a pleasant emotional state with a utilitarian item in their shopping list, they are likely to purchase a greater number of unplanned products if they are aroused than when they are not aroused. Study four also shows the conceptual link between <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> behaviour and consumers’ unhealthy consumption behaviour. Evidence from this experiment suggests that consumers who are {{more likely to engage in}} unplanned behaviour prefer unhealthy over healthy items. Besides, the results further demonstrate the robustness of the interaction effect of arousal and valence on consumers’ unplanned purchasing by testing the effect of arousal and valence on consumers’ unhealthy consumption choices. The insights gained by this research can help retailers, marketers and public policy makers to better understand how and why consumers buy unplanned items. The insights can help them to select marketing strategies inside the retail store that will persuade more customers to engage in <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> behaviour. Conversely the results can help consumer advocates and regulators to better identify where consumers may need protection. In same line, given the potentially harmful consequence of unplanned/impulse buying behaviour, the findings of this research can help marketers, public policy or social marketing researchers to understand and identify the best way to reduce unhealthy unplanned consumption...|$|E

Introduction: An impulse purchase or impulse <b>buying</b> is an <b>unplanned</b> or otherwise spontaneous purchase. Impulse items can be anything, a new product, samples or well-established products at surprising low prices. Parboteeah (2005) stated that impulse purchasing is unplanned, the result of an exposure to a stimulus, and is decided on-the-spot. Impulse buyers start browsing without having a purpose to procure a definite article or visiting certain store. As customers browse, they are exposed to the stimuli, which triggers customers’ urge to buy on impulse. When impulse consumers consider the aspiration to purchase, they construct a procure decision with no penetrating for data and information or appraising best possible alternatives. Then, customers may face positive or negative outcomes through the post-purchase assessment after the procure on impulse. In this progression, shoppers are prejudiced by inner and outside things that generate the impulse purchase behavio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhile {{numerous}} studies have demonstrated the impact of out-of-store marketing (e. g. shopping trip goals and price promotion) and in-store marketing (e. g. shelf design) on customer buying behavior, few studies have investigated the influence of social effects on unplanned in-store purchasing. In store-social influences refer to purchase behavior arising from a recommendation or advice from a closely connected and important person to the customer. The current study conducted two focus group interviews with respect to research participants’ grocery shopping experiences. The first focus group composed of 6 university staff and 8 university students were recruited for the second group. Most focus group participants are female. This is salient for the Thai cultural context whereby shopping is still considered the domain for females or housewives particularly for the university staff group. Research findings revealed that both groups mostly prepared shopping lists {{before going to the}} store. However, the list could be an unwritten note. Unplanned purchases were driven by economic value, such as discounted price and sales promotion. However it was found that an accompanying person could alter the research participant's planned buying list and even loyal brand purchases. Specifically, a customer's friend and/or relative may affect the respondent's purchasing pattern. For example, a friend or spouse or relative may give information about defects or the quality of products during in-store shopping. As a result, a customer's <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> decision may be affected by social effect in terms of buying or not-buying even though the customer is motivated by purchase impulses from shelf-exposure. Based on the current research's findings, {{there is a need to}} develop the current theoretical models for the <b>unplanned</b> <b>buying</b> by including the social effect. Furthermore, logical explanations why and how social effect has an impact on unplanned in-store buying are required and resulted in relevant construct development. Social media that is an important route of social effects on in-store buying behavior should be investigated. Strategic management implication is that market practitioners are required to consider the marketing program investments on the customer's social effect for enhancing the in-store unplanned product performance...|$|E

40|$|Impulse buying is an {{emerging}} phenomenon, {{which has been}} the focus of the retailers to attract the customers. Impulse behaviour is the outcome of emotional reactions that generate unpredicted urge to buy. Consumer behaviour is nowadays gaining much importance for retailers. Due to expansion of organized retail in India, retailers are trying to understand the behaviour of consumers that what product the consumer seeks for, why they need a particular product, when they need it and how they are going to purchase a product. Earlier there was a traditional buying behaviour of consumer in which they make a list for purchasing a product and they went to a particular store and purchase it.

By reviewing previous literatures, we have identified that there is still little research about the post-consumer behavior of impulse purchases, namely on consumers’ regret triggered from what they have bought impulsively. The {{purpose of this study is}} to discover the triggers of buyer regret from impulse purchase, which is presented by the research question “What are the triggers of buyer regret from impulse purchases?” By conducting a quantitative research, we proposed a conceptual model of impulse purchase regret that consists of six hypotheses. The technical tool that we used to test the conceptual model is a SPSS extension called AMOS, whereas the analysis method uses the application of structural equation modeling. We collected our primary data (187 viable responses) via a questionnaire through convenience sampling. By testing all the data with AMOS, we received the following result: 5 hypotheses are accepted and 1 hypothesis is rejected. This result indicates that upwards counterfactual thinking (CFT) on forgone alternatives, a change in significance, and under consideration are positively related to impulse purchase regret; external stimuli and consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence (CSII) have indirect influence on impulse purchase regret. By applying our theoretical background to analyze the result, we suggest that consumer’s rational buying thinking still plays an important role in post evaluation stage of impulse purchase, even though it disrupts the rational buying process in the beginning. Lastly, we believe that several parties could benefit from our research, they are marketing, academia as well as consumers. ...|$|E
