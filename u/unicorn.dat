It was from the Le Reale de France that he gained a basis for his design of the <b>Unicorn</b> jolly boat. No ship named the <b>Unicorn</b> was listed {{in the annals of}} the French Navy, but Hergé instead took the name from a British frigate which had been active in the mid-18th century; the fictional ship's <b>unicorn</b> figurehead was also adopted from the frigate.|$|E

5|$|Red Rackham's Treasure (1944) {{tells of}} the {{adventure}} Tintin and his friends undertake to recover the lost treasure of the pirate Red Rackham, believed by Tintin to be aboard the shipwrecked <b>Unicorn.</b> Sir Francis had built three models of the <b>Unicorn</b> and had hidden a treasure map inside each one. The adventure, told across both books, leads Tintin to the <b>Unicorn</b> and to the lost treasure.|$|E
5|$|The genus <b>Unicorn</b> was {{established}} in 1995 by Norman Platnick and Antônio Brescovit, to encompass five newly described species and one species, U. argentina, {{that had previously been}} described as a species of Orchestina. A seventh species was described in 2010. The type species of <b>Unicorn</b> is U. catleyi. <b>Unicorn</b> species occur in central and northern Chile, western Argentina, and Bolivia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unicorn</b> is {{a member}} of the family Oonopidae (oonopids, or goblin spiders), which {{contains}} over 1,500 species worldwide. Within oonopids, <b>Unicorn</b> is classified in the subfamily Sulsulinae, which contains other soft-bodied genera such as Xiombarg and Dalmasula. Due to certain features of the eyes and jaws that resemble those found in other families, and which are differently modified in many other oonopids, Platnick and Brescovit suggested <b>Unicorn</b> was among the most primitive or basal members of the Oonopidae, which was corroborated by a 2014 study that examined DNA similarities among the Oonopidae, finding that <b>Unicorn</b> and other sulsulines diverged before almost all other oonopids.|$|E

5|$|While sailing in the West Indies in 1676, the <b>Unicorn,</b> {{commanded}} by Sir Francis Haddock, is seized and captured {{by a group}} of pirates led by Red Rackham. The pirates hoist a red pennant—no life would be spared. During the battle, Sir Francis is hit and loses consciousness. Later, the members of the <b>Unicorn</b> crew still alive are killed or thrown overboard. Sir Francis regains consciousness, finding himself tied to the mainmast. The pirate ship is damaged and sinking, so Red Rackham moves his treasure on board the <b>Unicorn.</b> The ship then sails to an uninhabited island. When anchored near the shore of the island, Sir Francis manages to free himself and goes below deck to the <b>Unicorn</b> gunpowder stores. Whilst there, he encounters Rackham for the final time, killing him in a sword fight. Before escaping in the ship's jolly boat, he is able to set fire to the gunpowder by means of a slow-burning fuse, causing the <b>Unicorn</b> (with Rackham's drunken crew and presumably Red Rackham's treasure still aboard) to explode and sink.|$|E
5|$|In the Tintin adventures, the <b>Unicorn</b> is {{the setting}} of a battle between pirates and sailors {{followed}} by a duel between its captain, Sir Francis Haddock (an ancestor of Captain Haddock) and the pirate Red Rackham.

5|$|In {{the present}} day, Tintin, his dog Snowy, {{and his friends}} Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus follow {{coordinates}} that Sir Francis had left his three sons in a strange riddle hidden in three model ships of the <b>Unicorn.</b> Reaching the coordinates, they discover the island and, upon diving, they find {{the wreck of the}} <b>Unicorn.</b> Although they recover various artefacts from it, they do not find the treasure. Back in Belgium, Tintin realises that Sir Francis' message referred, not to the location of the <b>Unicorn,</b> but to a globe mounted on a statue in Sir Francis' former country home. Understanding now that Francis would never have left the treasure but would have taken it with him to his home, Tintin locates the coordinates to the treasure on the globe, presses a secret button he finds there, and discovers Red Rackham's treasure hidden inside.|$|E

The film's inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from multiple perspectives.|$|E
5|$|Entoloma murrayi, {{commonly}} known as the yellow <b>unicorn</b> Entoloma or the <b>unicorn</b> pinkgill, is a species of fungus in the Entolomataceae family.

The fungus produces yellow mushrooms that have a characteristic sharp umbo {{on the top of a}} conical cap. The mushroom is inedible and may be poisonous. Other similar species can be distinguished from E.murrayi by differences in color, morphology, or microscopic characteristics.|$|E
