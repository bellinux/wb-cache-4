40|$|OBJECTIVE. The recent {{experience}} with U tubes at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Lukes Medical Center was reviewed {{in order to}} assess their current role in hepatobiliary surgery. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA. Transhepatic intubation by a variety of methods has been used routinely for biliary decompression and inhibition of anastomotic stricture since the 1960 s. U tubes were popularized in the early 1970 s. However, little has been written about their use and efficacy in recent years. Because of the apparent benefits {{associated with the use of}} U tubes versus other stenting techniques, the authors performed this study. METHODS. The hospital and office charts of all patients who had U tubes placed between 1980 and 1992 were reviewed retrospectively. Between 1980 and 1992, U tubes were placed intraoperatively in 54 patients for biliary decompression and/or stenting. Twelve patients were operated on for benign causes of obstruction. Forty-two patients with malignant tumors underwent surgery for <b>U</b> <b>tube</b> placement in conjunction with or without tumor resection and anastomotic bypass. RESULTS. There was a 0 % operative mortality rate in the benign group. In six patients, the <b>U</b> <b>tube</b> played a major role in the long-term management of their disease processes. None of these patients has had restricture since removal of the tube. In the malignant group, the 30 -day operative mortality rate was 12 %. After 3 months, marked clinical improvement and complete biliary decompression were achieved, with mean bilirubin levels dropping from 14. 0 mg/dL to 1. 3 mg/dL. No patients in the malignant group required reoperation for recurrent biliary obstruction after <b>U</b> <b>tube</b> placement. CONCLUSIONS. The use of U tubes is advocated for biliary decompression and/or anastomotic stenting in patients with benign stricture or resectable malignancy and in patients with nonresectable, malignant biliary obstruction for adequate palliation of intractable jaundice...|$|E

A {{test system}} for {{geothermal}} parameters is designed with S 3 C 2440, {{it is an}} embedded system which can friendly display the test values and geothermal parameters in real time. The test theory is based on heat balance principle. A heater produce heat to induce into the ground through <b>U</b> buried <b>tube.</b> When equilibrated, {{the heat from the}} heater is equal to the heat taken away by ground. The heat taken away by ground is measured by testing the temperatures of two ends of <b>U</b> buried <b>tube</b> and the water velocity flowing through tube; the real produced heat by heater is measured by testing the current and voltage of heater. The heat power can be changed by controlling solid-state relay with PWM.

SARS has revealed the pressing need for research on possible solutions which {{take account of the}} numerous factors that may contribute to the spread of infection in multi-storey residential buildings, commercial and hospital buildings. The {{outbreak of}} SARS at Amoy Gardens in March 2003 has highlighted that a major cause of transmission of disease can result from the sewage system and the architectural design of residential buildings. At Amoy Garden, the building’s sewage system and design of the skywells meant that when leakage occurred in a quasi-confined space this provided a favourable virus transmission area. The consistent updraft of air in the skywell facilitated the travel of the virus to the upper floors of the building 1.

Pore fluid densities and total adsorption isotherms increased monotonically with increasing density of the bulk fluid, in contrast to excess adsorption isotherms, which reached a maximum and then decreased toward zero or negative values above the critical density of the bulk fluid. The isotherms of confined fluid density and excess adsorption obtained by VTD contain additional information. For instance, the maxima of excess adsorption occur below the critical density of the bulk fluid {{at the beginning of the}} plateau region in the total adsorption, marking the end of the transition of pore fluid to a denser, liquidlike pore phase. Compression of the confined fluid significantly beyond the density of the bulk fluid at the same temperature was observed even at subcritical temperatures.

Air at ambient conditions (310 K) was used as the fluidizing medium. The air flow rates were measured using a rotameter. Initially stagnant bed height of 5. 5 cm was taken. The superficial velocity (Air flow rate/area) of the air passed from below the distributor was increased in small increments. The corresponding manometer readings were noted down. Pressure drop at the corresponding superficial velocity was calculated from the height difference between two arms of the manometer. The Superficial velocity at which maximum pressure drop was obtained was noted as the minimum fluidization velocity. At the onset of fluidization bubbles appeared and the superficial velocity at which the first bubbles appeared was taken as the minimum bubbling velocity. The fluidization index is the ratio of minimum bubbling velocity to the minimum fluidization velocity.

40|$|The ODSCC {{detected}} in the TSP position of Ulchin 3 & 4 SGs are typical ODSCC of Alloy 600 MA tubes. The causative chemical environment is formed by concentration of impurities inside the occluded region formed by the tube surface, egg crate strips, and sludge deposit there. Most cracks are detected {{at or near the}} line contacts between the tube surface and the egg crate strips. The region of dense crack population, as defined as between 4 th and 9 th TSPs, and near the center of hot leg hemisphere plane, coincided well with the region of preferential sludge deposition as defined by thermal hydraulics calculation using SGAP computer code. The cracks developed homogeneously {{in a wide range of}} SGs, so that the number of cracks detected each outage increased very rapidly since the first detection in the 8 th refueling outage. The root cause assessment focused on investigation of the difference in microstructure and manufacturing residual stress in order to reveal the cause of different susceptibilities to ODSCC among identical six units. The manufacturing residual stress as measured by XRD on OD surface and by split tube method indicated that the high residual stress of Alloy 600 MA tube played a critical role in developing ODSCC. The level of residual stress showed substantial variations among the six units depending on details of straightening and OD grinding processes. Youngwang 3 & 4 tubes are less susceptible to ODSCC than U 3 and <b>U</b> 4 <b>tubes</b> because semi-continuous coarse chromium carbides are formed along the grain boundary of Y 3 & 4 tubes, while there are finer less continuous chromium carbides in U 3 and U 4. The different carbide morphology is caused by the difference in cooling rate after mill anneal. There is a possibility that high chromium content in the Y 3 & 4 tubes, still within the allowable range of Alloy 600, has made some contribution to the improved resistance to ODSCC.

Gels were characterized by <b>U</b> <b>tube</b> viscometry and their cloud points of gels. The properties of polymers and their mixture in matrices or in gels were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Compendial dissolution methodology was used to determine drug release from matrices and their release exponents. Propranolol hydrochloride increased the solubility of HPMC and altered the water distribution in their gels. The release of propranolol hydrochloride from HPMC matrices was dependent on the square root of time. Release exponents were - 0. 6, indicating that diffusion and erosion contributed to drug release. The release rates of propranolol hydrochloride from NaCMC matrices decreased as the NaCMC content increased. Addition of propranolol hydrochloride to NaCMC gels produced an insoluble complex which, in matrices, controlled the drug release. The interaction between propranolol hydrochloride and NaCMC was confirmed by DSC and dialysis. The viscosity grade of NaCMC affected the drug release. NaCMC matrices showed fast erosion. The release of sodium ions from matrices containing NaCMC was enhanced propranolol hydrochloride, confirming the occurrence of the interaction in matrices. The release of propranolol hydrochloride from NaCMC matrices was not dependent on either the square root of time or time. Large increases in release rates from matrices containing NaCMC in acidic media implied the polymer was unable to gel provide or a sustained release of propranolol hydrochloride at low pH. A synergistic increase in viscosity in gels containing HPMC and NaCMC probably played a minor role in propranolol release from matrices containing both polymers. NaCMC decreased the cloud point of HPMC. Drug release from matrices containing HPMC and NaCMC was very complicated, but zero order release was achieved from matrices containing 285 mg of 1 : 3 HPMC : NaCMC. Addition of HPMC to NaCMC matrices suppressed an initial burst release of propranolol. The release of propranolol hydrochloride from matrices containing HPMC and NaCMC was dependent on pH. Ethylcellulose was capable of binding = 14 % w/w water. Matrices containing ethylcellulose 7 cP (< 125 pm) showed lower release rates than matrices containing ethylcellulose 10 cP, or at greater particle sizes. Compaction pressure generally did not affect drug release. The release exponent from matrices containing ethylcellulose was 0. 44 - 0. 49 indicating diffusion predominated drug release.

It is {{based on the fact that}} the ranges of values of the thermal properties of the reinforced concrete and of the soil around them are the same. The methodology proposes EPs with different design to be compared by comparing the fluid temperature, under a constant heat injection rate (W per linear meter of pile’s length), considering a homogeneous infinite concrete - ground solid. Temperatures around the pipes are calculated by applying the Continuous Line Source Equation for each pipe, with a polynomial approximation of the exponential integral. The calculation period is the one just after the thermal influence between all the pipes has been developed and until the conductive heat transfer along the pile becomes significant. It is proved that the temperature at the axis of an EP of a given diameter does not depend on its design parameters. So, energy piles with different design parameters can be compared, the comparison based on the constant in time part of temperature difference between the fluid and that in the axis of the pile. The methodology is simple, easily applicable and closer to the real thermal behavior of the pile. By using it, useful findings on the thermal performance of EPs are resulted. The heat transfer in EPs along their length is examined also. Correlation functions between the mean temperature along the axis, the time after the emission start, the EP length and the emission radius are proposed. The finding is that short EPs with large diameters can receive higher thermal loads of long duration than the longer piles of smaller diameters. A survey for the thermal behavior of EPs is presented, given the fact that there is a significant difference between the thermal properties of the concrete and that of the surrounding soil. The survey is being carried out by means of the corresponding problem of heat diffusion in one dimension. According to the results can be seen that the thermal behavior of EPs under constant heat injection of short duration is determined by the thermal properties of the concrete. The thermal behavior of an EP under extra long term thermal loads is determined by the thermal properties of the surrounding soil.
