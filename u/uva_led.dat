40|$|BACKGROUND: There is no {{effective}} treatment for progressive macular hypomelanosis. Recent {{findings indicate that}} Propionibacterium acnes {{may play a role}} in the pathogenesis. OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy with anti-inflammatory therapy in patients with progressive macular hypomelanosis. METHODS: A total of 45 patients were randomized to a within-patient left-right comparison study of benzoyl peroxide 5 % hydrogel/clindamycin 1 % lotion in combination with UVA irradiation versus fluticasone 0. 05 % cream in combination with UVA irradiation. Repigmentation was determined by photometric measurements of changes in skin color and by patient and dermatologist assessment using before and after photographs. RESULTS: Benzoyl peroxide 5 % hydrogel, clindamycin 1 % lotion, and <b>UVA</b> <b>led</b> to better repigmentation than fluticasone 0. 05 % cream in combination with UVA irradiation in all measurements. (Photometric measurements P =. 007, patient assessment P <. 0001, and dermatologist assessment P <. 0001.) LIMITATIONS: There was difficult objective color measurement. Therefore, subjective assessment has important additional value. Right-left comparisons have certain inherent limitations. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with light was more effective in repigmentation in patients with progressive macular hypomelanosis than a combination of anti-inflammatory therapy and ligh...|$|E
50|$|With {{nitrides}} containing aluminium, {{most often}} AlGaN and AlGaInN, even shorter wavelengths are achievable. Ultraviolet LEDs {{in a range}} of wavelengths are becoming available on the market. Near-UV emitters at wavelengths around 375-395 nm are already cheap and often encountered, for example, as black light lamp replacements for inspection of anti-counterfeiting UV watermarks in some documents and paper currencies. Shorter-wavelength diodes, while substantially more expensive, are commercially available for wavelengths down to 240 nm. As the photosensitivity of microorganisms approximately matches the absorption spectrum of DNA, with a peak at about 260 nm, UV LED emitting at 250-270 nm are to be expected in prospective disinfection and sterilization devices. Recent research has shown that commercially available <b>UVA</b> <b>LEDs</b> (365 nm) are already effective disinfection and sterilization devices.UV-C wavelengths were obtained in laboratories using aluminium nitride (210 nm), boron nitride (215 nm) and diamond (235 nm).|$|R

In vivo, however, the lens is mainly exposed to visible light and the ageing lens absorbs a great part of the short wavelength region of incoming visible light. The aim of the present study was to examine the optical effects on human lenses of short wavelength visible light and ultraviolet radiation. Methods: Naturally aged human donor lenses were irradiated with UVA (355 nm), violet (400 and 405 nm) and green (532 nm) lasers. The effect of irradiation was evaluated qualitatively by photography and quantitatively by measuring the direct transmission before and after irradiation.

40|$|Native tissues are {{characterized}} by spatially organized three-dimensional (3 D) microscaled units which functionally define cells–cells and cells–extracellular matrix interactions. The ability to engineer biomimetic constructs mimicking these 3 D microarchitectures {{is subject to the}} control over cell distribution and organization. In the present study we introduce a novel protocol to generate 3 D cell laden hydrogel micropatterns with defined size and shape. The method, named photo-mold patterning (PMP), combines hydrogel micromolding within polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps and photopolymerization through a recently introduced biocompatible ultraviolet (UVA) activated photoinitiator (VA- 086). Exploiting PDMS micromolds as geometrical constraints for two methacrylated prepolymers (polyethylene glycol diacrylate and gelatin methacrylate), micrometrically resolved structures were obtained within a 3 min exposure to a low cost and commercially available <b>UVA</b> <b>LED.</b> The PMP was validated both on a continuous cell line (human umbilical vein endothelial cells expressing green fluorescent protein, HUVEC GFP) and on primary human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). HUVEC GFP and BMSCs were exposed to 1. 5 % w/v VA- 086 and UVA light (1 W, 385 nm, distance from sample = 5 cm). Photocrosslinking conditions applied during the PMP did not negatively affect cells viability or specific metabolic activity. Quantitative analyses demonstrated the potentiality of PMP to uniformly embed viable cells within 3 D microgels, creating biocompatible and favorable environments for cell proliferation and spreading during a seven days' culture. PMP can thus be considered as a promising and cost effective tool for designing spatially accurate in vitro models and, in perspective, functional constructs...|$|E

40|$|As human {{exploration}} adventures beyond low earth orbit, {{life support}} systems will require more innovation and research to become self-sustaining and durable. One major concern about future space travel {{is the ability to}} store and decontaminate water for consumption and hygiene. This project explores materials and technologies for possible use in future water systems without requiring point-of-use (POU) filtering or chemical additives such as iodine or silver that require multiple doses to remain effective. This experimentation tested the efficacy of a variety of antimicrobial materials against biofilm formation in a high shear CDC Biofilm Reactor (CBR) and some materials in a low shear Drip Flow Reactor (DFR) which(also utilizes ultra violet light emitting diodes (UVLEDs) as an antimicrobial resource. Most materials were tested in the CBR using the ASTM E 2562 - 07 1 method involving the Pseudomonas aeruginosa and coupon samples that vary in their antimicrobial coatings and surface layer topographies. In a controlled environmental chamber (CEC), the CBR underwent a batch phase, continuous flow phase (CFP), and a harvest before analysis. The DFR portion of this experimentation was performed in order to assess the antimicrobial capabilities of ultraviolet-A LEDs (UV-A) in potable water systems. The ASTM E 2647 - 08 was modified in order to incorporate UV-A LEDs and to operate as a closed, re-circulating system. The modified DFR apparatus that was utilized contains 4 separate channels each of which contain 2 UV-A LEDs (1 chamber is masked off to serve as a control) and each channel is equipped with its own reservoir and peristaltic pump head. The 10 DFR runs discussed in this report include 4 initial experimental runs that contained blank microscope slides to test the <b>UVA</b> <b>LEDs</b> alone, 2 that incorporated solid silver coupons, 2 that utilized titanium dioxide (Ti 02) coupons as a photocatalyst, and 2 runs that utilized silver coated acrylic slides.

40|$|Many ultraviolet-A (UVA) -induced {{biochemical}} {{and physiological}} changes are valid as biomarkers using aquatic species for detection {{of the degree}} of stress. Changes in the concentration and activities of enzymes, such as glucose- 6 -phosphate dehyderogenase (G 6 PDH), lactate dehyderogenase (LDH), DNA damage and lipid peroxidation (LPO), can be used as biomarkers to identify possible environmental contamination in fish. This study aimed to investigate the impact of UVA on the activity of the selected enzymes, DNA damage and LPO during early developmental stages of the African catfish Clarias gariepinus. Embryo hemogenates were used for measurements of G 6 PDH, LDH, DNA damage and LPO concentrations and activities spectrophotometrically at 37 °C. The normal ontogenetic variations in enzyme activities, DNA damage and LPO of the early developmental stages (24 – 168  h-PFS; hours-post fertilization stage) were studied. There was a significant decrease in the activity of G 6 PDH till 120  h-PFS. Then after 120  h-PFS, the activity of such enzymes insignificantly increased toward higher stages. The LDH activity was recorded with a pattern of decrease till 96  h-PFS, followed by a significant increase toward 168  h-PFS. The polynomial pattern of variations in DNA damage and LPO was also evident. The patterns of the enzyme activities, corresponding DNA damage and LPO of the early ontogenetic stages under the influence of three different UVA doses (15, 30 and 60  min), were recorded. The pattern of variations in G 6 PDH activity in UVA-induced groups was {{similar to that of the}} control group with variation in the magnitude of such activity. In all treated groups, LDH activity decreased till 96  h-PFS, then increased till 168  h-PFS.

This manuscript version is made available under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] linear engineered TiO 2 nanomaterials (LENs) were synthesized and evaluated in terms of settlability {{and their ability to}} remove natural organic matter (NOM) from river water. The size, surface characteristics, and crystallinity of the LENs were manipulated by varying the temperatures used during the synthesis procedure. All four LENs settled out of purified water more effectively than standard Degussa Evonik Aeroxide P 25 nanoparticles. The settling behaviour of the nanomaterials was impacted by surface charge effects and interactions with NOM and ionic species in the river water matrix. The reduction of two disinfection byproduct precursor surrogate parameters, DOC and UV 254, by the LENs via adsorption (no irradiation) and photocatalytic degradation under <b>UVA</b> <b>LED</b> irradiation was compared to that by P 25 nanoparticles. After 60 minutes of irradiation DOC removal by the LENs ranged from 20 to 50 % and UV 254 reduction ranged from 65 to 90 %. Two of the most promising LENs were reused multiple times and although both materials experienced decreases in treatment efficacy over successive reuse cycles, the reusability of both LENs was equal to or superior to that of P 25 nanoparticles. The electrical energy per order required to remove DOC and UV 254 from the water ranged from 8 to 36 times higher than that required for UV/H 2 O 2 treatment but comparable to results reported by other researchers using UV/TiO 2 for NOM removal. A subset of the nanomaterials evaluated in this study may prove to be a viable alternative to standard TiO 2 nanoparticles for the removal of DBP precursors from drinking water, but the characteristics of the water matrix have important effects on settling efficiency and will require site-specific evaluation.

40|$|Background It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that carotenoids including lycopene may reduce the risk of photodamage. However, carotenoids are unstable under light exposure and may produce prooxidative effects under certain circumstances. Aim of the study We examined whether lycopene inhibits ultraviolet A (UVA) -induced DNA damage and the expression of heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1). We hypothesized that the breakdown of lycopene by UVA irradiation, rather than intact lycopene itself, causes oxidative damage. Methods Mouse fibroblasts, C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 (C 3 H), were first enriched with 10 mu M of lycopene in the dark for 2 h before exposure to UVA (22. 5 KJ/m(2)). Then, DNA damage measured by the single-cell gel electrophoretic assay (comet assay) and the expression of HO- 1 measured by western blotting were determined. In addition, we exposed lycopene powder to UVA (22. 5 KJ/m(2)) to prepare pre-irradiated lycopene (ILP). Then, C 3 H cells were incubated with ILP for 2 h, and DNA damage and the expression of HO- 1 also were determined. Results We found that lycopene enrichment did not cause damage to DNA in C 3 H cells not irradiated with UVA. However, lycopene enrichment strongly induced DNA damage when cells were irradiated with UVA (by ca. 2 -fold as compared to control). In addition, lycopene enhanced UVA-induced HO- 1 expression by ca. 2. 5 -fold. <b>UVA</b> irradiation <b>led</b> to a significant loss of lycopene that had been pre-incorporated into C 3 H cells. When cells were incubated with lycopene that had been pre-irradiated with UVA without subjecting the cells to further UVA irradiation, cellular DNA damage and expression of HO- 1 were markedly increased, and these effects of irradiated lycopene were concentration-dependent. Conclusions These results demonstrate that lycopene enhances UVA-induced oxidative stress in C 3 H cells, and they suggest that under UVA irradiation, lycopene may produce oxidative products that are responsible for the prooxidant effects...|$|R
