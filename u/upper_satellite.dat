40|$|One {{can find}} several {{structures}} prone to buckling, with openings, for space applications. The European launcher Ariane 5 is capable {{to put in}} orbit two satellites at the same time. To do that, the <b>upper</b> <b>satellite</b> {{is supported by a}} composite structure called SYLDA. Inside the SYLDA the second satellite is placed. The launcher deploys the first satellite, then release the SYLDA and finally deploys the smaller satellite. The SYLDA structure must support the entire payload from the <b>upper</b> <b>satellite</b> during launch, but also it is required to have some holes for inspection and connection of the smaller satellite inside. The influence of these cutouts should be considered for the structural analysis in order to predict the correct buckling load. Furthermore, another critical structure with openings is the Inter Stage Structure. The entire payload is supported by this structure during launching...|$|E
30|$|Longer {{time series}} of Swarm data {{are needed to}} test and extend the {{preliminary}} results reported here for the secular variation and secular acceleration in 2015. The relatively long timescales involved, even for rapid secular acceleration pulses, mean that long-term monitoring from space is essential if new hypotheses concerning the responsible core physics are to be properly tested. A lengthy Swarm mission, with the satellites gradually moving to lower altitudes, thus holds great promise. As the constellation configuration evolves, and the local time separation between the <b>upper</b> <b>satellite</b> and the lower pair increases, {{there will also be}} exciting opportunities to study secular variation on even shorter timescales.|$|E
30|$|Swarm is a European Space Agency (ESA) mission {{consisting}} of three low Earth-orbiting satellites {{designed to measure}} the global magnetic and electric fields with greater accuracy than has previously been achieved (Friis-Christensen et al., 2006). Two satellites begin the mission {{at an altitude of}} 490 km in near identical orbits, whilst the third orbits at a higher altitude, initially 550 km. Their altitudes will descend over the mission, most quickly for the lower pair.

30|$|Swarm is a European Space Agency (ESA) mission {{consisting}} of three low Earth orbiting satellites {{designed specifically to}} measure magnetic and electric fields to a greater accuracy than ever before (Friis-Christensen et al., 2006). Two lower satellites fly at a 450 km nominal altitude in near-identical orbits, separated by 15 seconds in time at their equatorial crossing, while the third flies in a higher orbit at about 530 km. The orbits of the two lower satellites drift relative to the <b>upper</b> <b>satellite</b> {{over the course of}} the nominal mission (four years), gradually achieving local time separation to improve the temporal sensitivity of the data, while the lower two satellites will provide improved spatial sensitivity through the use of gradient information. Note the altitude of the three satellites will decrease over the mission lifetime.|$|E
30|$|One {{possible}} solution {{to these problems}} is to combine ground-based GPS data with space-borne measurements. Observations from a GPS receiver with a zenith-looking antenna placed onboard a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite offer an opportunity to separate the ionospheric irregularities registered above a LEO from that on the ground. Earlier, Noja et al. (2013), and Zakharenkova and Astafyeva (2015) demonstrated that space-borne GPS measurements onboard a solo-satellite mission (CHAMP) could successfully be used to study the occurrence of high-latitude topside ionospheric irregularities. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantages of using LEO multi-satellite missions for monitoring high-latitude ionospheric irregularities. Our focus was on the successful European Space Agency (ESA) Swarm mission, launched in November 2013, and currently in orbit for more than 2  years. Swarm is a constellation of three identical satellites that orbit at two altitudes of ~ 460 and ~ 510  km; the <b>upper</b> <b>satellite</b> (Swarm B) slowly separates in local time from the tandem satellites (Swarms A and C). We analyze {{the differences in the}} spatial distribution of ionospheric irregularities detected by the ground-based permanent GPS network with that of the topside GPS measurements onboard the Swarm constellation, using a case study of the 2015 St. Patrick’s Day storm. Additionally, we include GPS measurements from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and TerraSAR-X (SAR—synthetic aperture radar) satellites that orbit at similar altitudes to Swarm.|$|E
30|$|One other {{important}} feature from Fig.  4 {{is that the}} estimates derived from both ROTI and RODI data for both post-sunset and post-midnight periods from the SWA satellite differ from the corresponding SWB observations. Several factors {{can contribute to the}} observed satellite-to-satellite differences. First is an altitude difference of ~ 50  km between two satellites with possibility that the <b>upper</b> <b>satellite</b> can cross the plasma density irregularities with lesser intensity than the lower satellite. We should also note that both ROTI and RODI values are based on absolute differences and for the cases of generally lower TEC and Ne values at higher orbit altitudes for SWB satellite the derived ROTI and RODI might be lower here comparing with the lower SWA satellite. The second and more important reason is the temporal/longitudinal separation between the satellites. As shown in Fig.  1, SWA satellite flew in the post-sunset sector earlier than SWB and for the most covered seasons (September 2014, March 2015, June 2015 and December 2015) SWA provided more observations for 20 – 23 LT temporal range. Progressive longitude separation of the satellites becomes more essential for the evening LT sector in February 2015 and reaches more than 1.5  h in LT. This means that SWB satellite appears over the same region up to several hours after SWA and in the case when SWA could be able to cross plasma irregularities near the peak of their occurrence rate, the successive SWB could cross the decaying plasma bubbles and the obtained estimates of the occurrence probability should be lesser for SWB. This difference between SWA and SWB results could be clearly observed while comparing the December 2014 and December 2015 solstices (Fig.  5 a, c, right panels), where an increased separation between satellites (from 0.7 – 1.0 to 2.6 – 2.9  h) leads to a much smaller values of the occurrence rates derived from the SWB observations.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetic}} fields of space-borne current systems {{contribute significantly to}} magnetometer measurements made by low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. The accurate characterisation of these spatially and temporally varying fields is important {{in order to make}} effective use of the abundance of high-precision satellite magnetic data collected over the last decade. With the launch of ESA’s Swarm satellite constellation mission in 2012, the future of LEO satellite exploration of the geomagnetic field will be driven by constellation missions. We report on advances in processing techniques for Earth-external field measurements made with a constellation of satellites in LEO. Stauning and Primdahl (2000) have proposed a method of applying Ampère’s law integral along-track for a single satellite path to infer ionospheric current flow through a closed loop. Ritter and Lühr (2006) have since proposed a higher resolution application of the Ampère’s law integral designed to resolve radial ionospheric currents with the Swarm constellation. We expand on these methods by posing the closed loop as the outline of the radial arc formed by the overflight of two satellites at different altitudes. The CHAMP and Ørsted LEO magnetic satellites are used for this purpose. Throughout the period 2000 - 2005, we solve for toroidal ionospheric current flow in the region between the two satellites at discrete intervals. Analysis focuses on the characterisation of the toroidal currents at different local times. Since the orbit of CHAMP decays faster than that of Ørsted, a limited characterisation of changes in the toroidal currents with altitude is possible. The number of viable overlaps of the two satellites is relatively small. To avoid the possibility of rapidly temporally variant magnetospheric fields biasing the toroidal field solutions, we test the application of a further constellationspecific processing method. Using a limited number of orbits of the <b>upper</b> <b>satellite,</b> we solve for the dipole component of the magnetospheric field sources. Using a series of these solutions we can gauge the magnetospheric field activity at that local time. An index of this type is suitable for the processing of data from overlying satellite tracks. In future, a similar approach could be used to provide an ‘instantaneous’ external field correction in a satellite constellation. References: Ritter, P. & Lühr, H., 2006.

30|$|The Swarm mission {{consists}} of three identical satellites; two of them fly in tandem separated by 1 °– 1.4 ° at an orbit altitude of 460  km, and the third satellite has an orbit altitude of 510  km. The mission has a multi-instrument payload, of which we used two instruments: (1) Langmuir plasma probe and (2) an eight-channel dual-frequency GPS receiver with a zenith-looking POD antenna. The number of channels in a GPS receiver corresponds to a maximal number of simultaneous tracking GPS satellites.
