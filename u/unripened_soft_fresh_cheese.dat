40|$|In this article, the {{relevance}} of increasing the production of cheeses on the domestic market of the Republic of Kazakhstan is shown. In accordance with changes {{in the structure of}} the population’s nutrition and protein deficit, increasing attention is being paid to increasing the use of protein resources for food purposes, including the creation of new products. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the volume of world cheese production is constantly increasing. When polling the population in recent years it became clear that the cheese–curd market is waiting for the local producer. Therefore, the concept of development of low–cost cheeses remains to be topical — with high yield and accelerated maturation periods, which will be analogues of import–brand brands. The advantages of organizing the production of <b>soft</b> <b>fresh</b> cream <b>cheese</b> and cheese products of this type for domestic cheesemakers lie on the surface: this is a relatively new product for our market, soft cheeses have an extremely high yield, which makes their products very cost-effective, and this kind of cheese now has steady and constantly growing demand. The difference between <b>fresh</b> <b>soft</b> <b>cheeses</b> is that they are not pressed in production, the dairy raw material is gentle heat treatment, thanks to which useful substances remain intact in cheese. Proceeding from this, it can be concluded that the innovations and increase in the production of <b>soft</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> are real and possible and necessary...|$|R
50|$|Cheesecake is a sweet dessert {{consisting}} {{of one or}} more layers. The main, and thickest layer, consists of a mixture of <b>soft,</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> (typically cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar; if there is a bottom layer it often consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sponge cake. It may be baked or unbaked (usually refrigerated). Cheesecake is usually sweetened with sugar and may be flavored or topped with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, or chocolate syrup. Cheesecake can be prepared in many flavors, such as strawberry, pumpkin, key lime, chocolate, Oreo, chestnut, or toffee.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>fresh</b> <b>cheeses</b> are curdled only by acidity, {{but most}} cheeses also use rennet. Rennet sets the cheese into {{a strong and}} rubbery gel {{compared}} to the fragile curds produced by acidic coagulation alone. It also allows curdling at a lower acidity—important because flavor-making bacteria are inhibited in high-acidity environments. In general, <b>softer,</b> smaller, <b>fresher</b> <b>cheeses</b> are curdled with {{a greater proportion of}} acid to rennet than harder, larger, longer-aged varieties.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the capacity of emulsions containing saturated monoglyceride self-assembly structures to deliver omega- 3 fatty acids in <b>fresh</b> <b>soft</b> <b>cheese.</b> To this aim, fortified emulsions containing different ratios of milk, saturated monoglycerides (MGs) and cod liver oil were added to milk before cheese-making. These emulsions were characterised by distinct microstructural features observed by polarised light microscopy and apparent viscosity values. The omega- 3 delivery performance of MG emulsions highlighted that this strategy allowed a good retention of the omega- 3 -rich oil in the curd (up to 75 %). The fortified cheeses showed yield value and fat content higher than those of control samples. The enriched cheese showed hardness and cohesiveness obtained by texture profile analysis {{similar to those of the}} unfortified product.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of high pressure homogenization (HPH) as milk pre-treatment in the process of manufacturing cheese fortified with omega- 3 fatty acids. Raw milk was fortified with animal and vegetable sources of omega- 3 fatty acids and homogenized at increasing pressure from 20 to 100 MPa. Treated milk was then used to prepare queso fresco, a <b>soft</b> and <b>fresh</b> Hispanic <b>cheese.</b> Cheese yield, moisture, fat content, and texture were evaluated after processing. The development of oxidation was also monitored during cheese storage at 4 degrees C for up to 21 days. Pressure higher than 50 MPa was necessary to effectively incorporate omega- 3 fatty acids in cheese and at the same time to reduce the quantity of oil lost in the whey. Homogenization treatments caused cheese quality attribute changes due to modifications induced by HPH process on native structures of milk. Cheeses obtained with homogenization showed higher moisture and yield and lower fat content than untreated cheeses. A decrease of texture parameters was also observed for homogenized samples.

40|$|The use of {{commercial}} starter cultures in <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> production from pasteurized milk {{results in the}} loss of typical characteristics of artisan <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> due to the replacement of complex native microbiota with a defined starter culture. Hence, the aim of this research is to isolate and characterize dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in artisan <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> and to evaluate their capacity as autochthonous starter cultures for <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> production. Fifteen most prevalent Gram-positive, catalase-negative and asporogenous bacterial strains were selected for a more detailed characterization. Eleven lactic acid bacterial strains were determined to be homofermentative cocci and four heterofermentative lactobacilli. Further phenotypic and genotypic analyses revealed that those were two different LAB strains with high acidifying and proteolytic activity, identified as Lactobacillus fermentum A 8 and Enterococcus faecium A 7. These two autochthonous strains, alone or in combination with commercial starter, were used to produce different types of <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese,</b> which were evaluated by a panel. Conventional culturing, isolation, identification and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) procedures, applied to the total <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> DNA extracts, were employed to define and monitor the viability of the introduced LAB strains and their effect on the final product characteristics. Production of <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> using a combination {{of commercial}} starter culture and selected autochthonous strains resulted in improved sensorial properties, which were more similar to the ones of spontaneously fermented <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> than to those of cheese produced with only starter culture or selected strains. After 10 days of storage, that cheese retained the best sensorial properties in comparison with all other types of cheese. The presence of inoculated autochthonous and starter cultures and their identification was demonstrated by DGGE analysis. The obtained results indicate that autochthonous strains have a strong potential to enrich the flavour of industrially produced <b>fresh</b> type <b>cheese</b> under controlled conditions...|$|R

No statistically significant differences between the total nitrogen (TN) and nitrogen fraction (% of TN) contents, the degradation of intact αs- or β-caseins, total free amino acid (FAA) contents, and the ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic peptides in the water-soluble fraction of RMC and PMC were found. Threonine, alanine and lysine were the principal FAAs. Oleic, palmitic, capric and caprylic acids, and ethyl hexonate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, ethanol, 3 -methyl butanol, phenyl ethyl alcohol and acetone were the most abundant free fatty acids and volatile compounds, respectively. Cheese lipolysis evolved slowly at 4 °C, and milk pasteurization had no significant effect on it. Mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were predominant in <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> samples. PMC samples had significantly lower levels of enterococci and enterobacteria than RMC samples, while yeasts grew at similar levels during storage at 4 °C.
