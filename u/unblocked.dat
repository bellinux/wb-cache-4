5|$|Some {{effective}} {{techniques for}} the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage. The latter include covering of openings such as: air and water intakes, aircraft engines and windows during ash fall events. Roads may be closed to allow clean-up of ash falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall. To prevent further effects on underground water systems or waste water networks, drains and culverts should be <b>unblocked</b> and ash prevented from entering the system. Ash can be moistened (but not saturated) by sprinkling with water, to prevent remobilisation of ash and to aid clean-up. Prioritisation of clean-up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean-up efforts also constitute good management practice.|$|E

40|$|Rippling is a {{heuristic}} {{technique for}} guiding rewriting of a goal {{with respect to}} one or more givens. Rewriting is restricted so that the similarities between goal and given are preserved and the movement of differences is directed and terminating. <b>Unblocking</b> is a technique for changing the differences to enable a subsequent ripple. The standard definition of rippling currently prevents certain, otherwise desirable, <b>unblocking</b> steps. In particular, some desirable <b>unblocking</b> steps increase the wellfounded measure on which the termination proof of rippling is based. We propose an alternative family of well-founded measures under which the combination of rippling and <b>unblocking</b> is terminating. These new measures extend the power of rippling. 1 Introduction Rippling 1 is a heuristic technique for guiding rewriting of a goal with respect {{to one or more}} givens [Bundy et al, 1993]. Rippling and <b>unblocking</b> were originally developed for guiding the step cases of inductive proofs [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{sought to}} develop the suggestion that, under some circumstances, common associative learning mechanisms might underlie animal conditioning and human causal learning, by demonstrating, in humans, an effect analogous to the <b>unblocking</b> by reinforcer omission observed in animal conditioning. Experiment 1 found no such effect. Experiment 2, designed to prevent inhibitory influences that might have masked excitatory <b>unblocking</b> in Experiment 1, demonstrated <b>unblocking,</b> indicating common human-animal associative learning mechanisms in which the associability of a stimulus varies {{as a function of}} its predictive history. Experiment 3, using a similar design but with a procedure promoting application of rational inference processes, failed to detect the same <b>unblocking</b> effect, indicating that associative and cognitive mechanisms may influence human causal learning...|$|R
40|$|Six {{experiments}} used rats {{to study}} blocking and <b>unblocking</b> of fear learning. An excitatory stimulus (A) blocked fear learning to a neutral stimulus (B). <b>Unblocking</b> of B occurred if the AB compound signaled {{an increase in}} unconditioned stimulus (US) intensity or number. Assessments of associative change during blocking showed that more was learned about B than A. Such assessments during <b>unblocking</b> revealed that more was learned about B than A following an increase in US intensity but not US number. These US manipulations had no differential effects on single-cue learning. The results show that variations in US intensity or number produce <b>unblocking</b> of fear learning, but for each there is a different profile of associative change and a potentially different mechanism...|$|R

25|$|While {{blogging}} {{remains a}} key {{form of political}} protest, in the 2009 uprisings, Facebook began {{to take a more}} central role. The physical, rather than virtual protests spread through word-of-mouth rather than blogs. When possible, instances of police abuse were captured on mobile phone videos and then uploaded to YouTube, most famously the video of Neda Agha Soltan being shot to death in the streets of Teheran. These videos were shared on Facebook, fueling the protests. Originally blocked by the government in 2006, it had been <b>unblocked</b> in 2009, just months before the protests.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 17th and 18thcenturies, the walls {{continued}} to be maintained; Beckman's report (1680) recommended the repair or reconstruction of 235 yards of the walls. In 1735 a tower over Beverley Gate was removed due to its poor condition, and Hessle Gate <b>unblocked</b> in 1761; the walls were reported to be in very poor condition in 1752. In 1774 the walls from North Gate to Harry Ogle's Tower, on the Humber bank were granted to the Hull Dock Company {{for the construction of}} a new town dock.|$|E
40|$|Two appetitive {{conditioning}} {{experiments with}} rats investigated the mechanisms and properties of <b>unblocking</b> {{that results from}} the surprising omission of an expected post-trial unconditioned stimulus (US). Experiment 1 demonstrated <b>unblocking</b> under circumstances in which differences in the contri-bution of generalization decrement and within-compound associations are equated across experimental and control groups. Following Stage 1 training in which a conditioned stimulus (CS) A {{was followed by a}} US and a post-trial US, in Experiment 2 we arranged for the post-trial US to be present on some trials with AX but not others. Under these circumstances an enhancement of <b>unblocking</b> to X was observed, relative to a group who received standard <b>unblocking</b> by US omission. The implications of these results for attentional and US-processing theories of associative learning are discussed...|$|R

The teams traded possession twice, and with just over 4 minutes remaining in the overtime, Tampa Bay was pinned back at their own 5-yard line. Tom Tupa attempted to punt on 4th down from the endzone, but Fred McAfee was <b>unblocked.</b> Tupa avoided the tackle, and attempted a desperation shovel pass to John Howell from his non-throwing arm. The ball was intercepted by James Allen, standing in the confines of the endzone, and the Saints were credited with a game-winning touchdown.|$|E

500|$|In his {{two seasons}} at Alabama, Cody helped the Crimson Tide {{to lead the}} Southeastern Conference in rushing defense, {{allowing}} opponents a rushing average of only 78.8 and 78.1 yards per game in 2008 and 2009, respectively. No individual player reached the 100-yard rushing mark against the Crimson Tide in those two seasons; Anthony Dixon of Mississippi State came closest with 81 yards in 2009. Cody's presence improved Alabama's pass rush despite his not being an effective pass rusher himself.

500|$|On 14 July, Iraqi army {{officers}} Abdel Karim Qasim and Abdel Salam Aref overthrew the Iraqi monarchy and, the next day, Iraqi {{prime minister and}} Nasser's chief Arab antagonist, Nuri al-Said, was killed. The entire Iraqi royal family was killed, and Al-Said's and Iraqi crown prince 'Abd al-Ilah's bodies were mutilated and dragged across Baghdad. Nasser recognized the new government and stated that [...] "any attack on Iraq was tantamount to {{an attack on the}} UAR". On 15 July, US marines landed in Lebanon, and British special forces in Jordan, upon the request of those countries' governments to prevent them from falling to pro-Nasser forces. Nasser felt that the revolution in Iraq left the road for pan-Arab unity <b>unblocked.</b> On 19 July, for the first time, he declared that he was opting for full Arab union, although he had no plan to merge Iraq with the UAR.

500|$|Motley {{was signed}} to a {{contract}} worth $4,500 a year ($ in [...] dollars). With the Browns, he joined a potent offense led by quarterback Otto Graham, tackle and placekicker Lou Groza and receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. He was {{a force to be}} reckoned with in the AAFC, and helped the team win every championship in the league's four years of existence between 1946 and 1949. He had a combination of quickness and power – he was listed at 238 pounds – that helped him plow through tacklers. He was also an able pass blocker and played on defense as a linebacker. Motley rushed for an average of 8.2 yards per carry in his first season. His forte was the trap play, a scheme where a defensive lineman was allowed to come across the line of scrimmage <b>unblocked,</b> opening up space for Motley to run. He led the league in rushing in 1948 as the Browns posted a perfect 15–0 record. He was the AAFC's all-time rushing leader when the league folded after the 1949 season and the Browns were absorbed into the more established National Football League (NFL). The Browns had a 47–4–3 overall regular-season win-loss-tie record during the AAFC years as Motley rushed for a total of 3,024 yards.|$|E
