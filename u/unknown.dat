5|$|A {{number of}} {{compounds}} can also bind to cCTnC with low affinity: EMD 57033, resveratrol, bepridil, and EGCG. All of these compounds are renowned for their promiscuity, and the biological {{significance of these}} interactions is <b>unknown.</b> In particular, it is <b>unknown</b> how interaction with cCTnC influences the calcium affinity of cNTnC.|$|E
5|$|A {{youth to}} Fortune and to Fame <b>unknown.</b>|$|E
5|$|Also in 1939, Campbell {{started the}} fantasy {{magazine}} <b>Unknown</b> (later <b>Unknown</b> Worlds). Although <b>Unknown</b> was canceled after only four years, {{a victim of}} wartime paper shortages, the magazine's editorial direction was significant {{in the evolution of}} modern fantasy.|$|E
5|$|Anna Rosemond in an <b>unknown</b> role.|$|E
5|$|Anne Leech and Anne Wright, origin <b>unknown.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{discussed}} above, in the PostgreSQL {{implementation of}} SQL, Null {{is used to}} represent all <b>UNKNOWN</b> results, including the <b>UNKNOWN</b> BOOLEAN. PostgreSQL does not implement the <b>UNKNOWN</b> literal (although it does implement the IS <b>UNKNOWN</b> operator, which is an orthogonal feature.) Most other major vendors {{do not support the}} Boolean type (as defined in T031) as of 2012. The procedural part of Oracle's PL/SQL supports BOOLEAN however variables; these can also be assigned NULL and the value is considered the same as <b>UNKNOWN.</b>|$|E

5|$|Fields with a — have <b>unknown</b> values.|$|E
5|$|Flashman died in 1915, {{although}} {{the details are}} <b>unknown.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{view of the}} above, {{observe that}} for SQL's WHERE clause a {{tautology}} similar {{to the law of}} excluded middle can be written. Assuming the IS <b>UNKNOWN</b> operator is present, p OR (NOT p) OR (p IS <b>UNKNOWN)</b> is true for every predicate p. Among logicians, this is called law of excluded fourth.|$|E
5|$|On systems which don't {{support the}} F571 extension, it is {{possible}} to emulate IS <b>UNKNOWN</b> p by going over every argument that could make the expression p <b>Unknown</b> and test those arguments with IS NULL or other NULL-specific functions, although this may be more cumbersome.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of epilepsy is <b>unknown,</b> {{but a little}} is known about its cellular and network mechanisms. However, it is <b>unknown</b> under which circumstances the brain shifts into the activity of a seizure with its excessive synchronization.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of Clan McNaie is <b>unknown.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of Djedkare's mother is similarly <b>unknown.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} and {{ownership of the}} painting are presently <b>unknown.</b>|$|E
5|$|The squad {{consisted}} of 26 players. The exact names {{of several of}} the players is <b>unknown.</b> The number of matches played is a minimum number only– the line-ups for a number of matches in Britain and Australia are either incomplete or <b>unknown.</b>|$|E
5|$|These confusions arise {{because the}} Law of Identity is {{restricted}} in SQL's logic. When dealing with equality comparisons using the NULL literal or the <b>UNKNOWN</b> truth-value, SQL will always return <b>UNKNOWN</b> {{as the result}} of the expression. This is a partial equivalence relation and makes SQL an example of a Non-Reflexive logic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unknown</b> (UNK): Unable to {{determine}} phase of flight.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unknown</b> {{civilian}} user operated one converted bomber. The {{registration of}} the He 111 was YR-PTP. It is <b>unknown</b> {{whether this was}} a German or Romanian designation. Works, or factory number is <b>unknown.</b>|$|E
5|$|When it {{was next}} decided to cast an <b>unknown</b> actor, casting {{director}} Lynn Stalmaster first suggested Christopher Reeve, but Donner and the producers {{felt he was}} too young and skinny. Over 200 <b>unknown</b> actors auditioned for Superman.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that microbes at this level could be soaking up ultraviolet light from the Sun {{as a source of}} energy, which could be a possible explanation for dark patches seen on UV images of the planet. Large, non-spherical cloud particles have also been detected in the cloud decks. In 2012, the abundance and vertical distribution of these <b>unknown</b> ultraviolet absorbers in the Venusian atmosphere have been investigated from analysis of Venus Monitoring Camera images, but their composition is still <b>unknown.</b> In 2016, disulfur dioxide has been identified as a possible candidate for causing the so far <b>unknown</b> UV absorption of the Venusian atmosphere.|$|E
