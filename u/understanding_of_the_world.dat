30|$|Along {{the same}} line, {{there are two}} {{principles}} of language learner autonomy which also support higher order thinking, as students develop their <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> through their educational program. One is that students are not just language learners but are also active users <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language for learning and communicating about issues of concern to them (Little, 2000, pp. 15 – 16; Benson, 2002, pp. 15 – 17). The other principle is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political approach to learner autonomy (Benson, 1997) and emphasizes <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> learners to decide <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> their learning, and to use language for their own reasons and purposes. Douglas Barnes (1992) spotlights the relationship between developing our <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and a purposeful, autonomous approach to learning: “We educate children in order to change their behavior by changing their view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> We {{want to change the}} way they perceive <b>the</b> <b>world</b> they live in, not so they will carry out our purposes, but so they can formulate their own purposes, and estimate their value” (Barnes, 1992, p. 80).|$|R

25|$|In {{connection}} with healthcare philosophy, {{the theory of}} natural rights becomes a rather pertinent subject. After birth, man is effectively endowed {{with a series of}} natural rights that cannot be banished under any circumstances. One major proponent of natural rights theory was seventeenth-century English political philosopher John Locke. With regard to the natural rights of man, Locke states, Although partially informed by his religious <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> Locke's statement can essentially be viewed as an affirmation of the right to preserve one's life at all costs. This point is precisely where healthcare as a human right becomes relevant.|$|E

25|$|The Scientific Revolution changed humanity's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> {{and led to}} the Industrial Revolution, a major {{transformation}} of the world's economies. The Scientific Revolution in the 17th century had had little immediate effect on industrial technology; only {{in the second half of}} the 18th century did scientific advances begin to be applied substantially to practical invention. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and used new modes of production—the factory, mass production, and mechanization—to manufacture a wide array of goods faster and using less labour than previously required. The Age of Enlightenment also led to the beginnings of modern democracy in the late-18th century American and French Revolutions. Democracy and republicanism would grow to have a profound effect on world events and on quality of life.|$|E
25|$|Some {{historians and}} admirers of Patel such as Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India and {{industrialist}} J. R. D.

Proponents of free enterprise cite the failings of Nehru's socialist policies as opposed to Patel's defence of property rights and his mentorship of what was to be later known as the Amul co-operative project.

25|$|Read on its own, the First Meditation {{can be seen}} as {{presenting}} skeptical doubts as {{a subject}} of study in their own right. Certainly, skepticism is a much discussed and hotly debated topic in philosophy, even today. Descartes raised the mystifying question of how we can claim to know with certainty anything about the world around us. The idea is not that these doubts are probable, but that their possibility can never be entirely ruled out. And if we can never be certain, how can we claim to know anything? Skepticism cuts straight {{to the heart of the}} Western philosophical enterprise and its attempt to provide a certain foundation for our knowledge and <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> It can even be pushed so far as to be read as a challenge to our very notion of rationality.|$|E
25|$|Christian {{embassies}} {{were sent}} {{as far as}} Karakorum during the Mongol invasions of the Levant, from which they gained a greater <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> The first of these travellers was Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, dispatched by Pope Innocent IV to the Great Khan, who journeyed to Mongolia and back from 1241 to 1247. About the same time, Russian prince Yaroslav of Vladimir, and subsequently his sons Alexander Nevsky and Andrey II of Vladimir, travelled to the Mongolian capital. Though having strong political implications, their journeys left no detailed accounts. Other travellers followed, like French André de Longjumeau and Flemish William of Rubruck, who reached China through Central Asia. Marco Polo, a Venetian merchant, dictated an account of journeys throughout Asia from 1271 to 1295, describing being a guest at the Yuan Dynasty court of Kublai Khan in Travels, and it was read throughout Europe.|$|E

25|$|Sammanas and Brahmin gurus {{historically}} offered {{education by}} means of donations, rather than charging fees or the procurement of funds from students or their guardians. Later, stupas, temples also became centres of education; religious education was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught. Students were required to be brahmacaris or celibates. The knowledge in these orders was often related to the tasks {{a section of the}} society had to perform. The priest class, the Sammanas, were imparted knowledge of religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the warrior class, the Kshatriya, were trained in the various aspects of warfare. The business class, the Vaishya, were taught their trade and the working class of the Shudras was generally deprived of educational advantages.

25|$|While with Wordsworth, Coleridge {{was able}} to read the poem and provide his {{response}} to the ode's question within an early draft of his poem, Dejection: an Ode. Coleridge's answer was to claim that the glory was the soul and it is a subjective answer to the question. Wordsworth took a different path as he sought to answer the poem, which was to declare that childhood contained the remnants of a beatific state and that being able to experience the beauty that remained later was something to be thankful for. The difference between the two could be attributed to the differences in the poets' childhood experiences; Coleridge suffered from various pain in his youth whereas Wordsworth's was far more pleasant. It is possible that Coleridge's earlier poem, The Mad Monk (1800) influenced the opening of the ode and that discussions between Dorothy and Wordsworth about Coleridge's childhood and painful life were influences on the crafting of the opening stanza of the poem. However, the message in the ode, as with Tintern Abbey, describes the pain and suffering of life as able to dull the memory of early joy from nature but it is unable to completely destroy it. The suffering leads Wordsworth to recognise what is soothing in nature, and he credits the pain as leading to a philosophical <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lysaker & Lysaker {{explained}} that Bakhtin theorized {{of human beings}} as entities composed of a multiplicity of voices (self-as-father, self-as-son, self-as-student, self-as-teacher, self-as-sad, self-as-happy, self-as-pro-life) that are in constant flux within him as he dialogues with and relates to the world around him. These voices constantly arrange and re-arrange themselves in hierarchies that are not governed by an overarching ego. Each hierarchy of voices (roles and dispositions) constitutes a dialogical position. Lysaker & Lysaker use the term dialogical positions because they are exactly the positions (roles and dispositions) Dasein takes {{up in the world}} when interacting with and relating to others—-and are constituted by his polyphonic nature. The flux, or re-arrangement, occurs from situational contexts that tells Dasein which dialogical position, or set of voices, must come to the foreground. The flux is also based on increased <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> around human beings and their respective roles in it. Hermeneuts {{say that this is a}} stark contrast to mainstream paradigms in psychotherapy. Instead of a single ego, or voice, that makes up a person's identity and stands above and against the world, a constantly-rearranging hierarchy of multiple voices dialogues with others and co-constitutes a person's identity, and that this is the reason that Taylor writes that we should abandon paradigms such as the self as a highly autonomous individual and re-conceptualize that self as a dialogical self that is always-already a relational being constantly engaged in multiple ongoing conversations.|$|E
