500|$|In June, it was {{announced}} that Anbar Province would be the tenth province to transfer to Provincial Iraqi Control, the first such Sunni region. This handover was delayed by bad weather and a suicide bombing on 26 June in Karmah at a meeting between Sunni Sheikhs and US Marines which killed more than 23 people, including three Marines. In July, presidential candidate Barack Obama visited Ramadi and met with Governor Rasheed, Sheikh Abu Rish, and 30 other sheikhs and senior military personnel. In the meeting, Obama promised that [...] "the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> abandon Iraq" [...] (his opponent, John McCain, had visited Haditha in March 2008). On 26 August, Iraqi leaders signed the Command and Control Memorandum of Understanding in a ceremony at the Anbar Governance Center, a step towards taking full control and responsibility for security from Coalition forces. Less than a week later, on 1 September, the transition became official.|$|E

You will declare that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> invade Cuba with its troops and will not support any other forces which might intend to invade Cuba. Then the necessity {{of the presence of}} our military specialists in Cuba will disappear." [...] At 6:45pm EDT, news of Fomin's offer to Scali was finally heard and was interpreted as a [...] "set up" [...] for the arrival of Khrushchev's letter. The letter was then considered official and accurate although it was later learned that Fomin was almost certainly operating of his own accord without official backing. Additional study of the letter was ordered and continued into the night.|$|E

In addition to the CIA documents, The New York Times reported that Golinger also obtained [...] "reams of documents from the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit agency financed by the United States government, that show that $2.2 million was spent from 2000 to 2003 to train or finance anti-Chávez parties and organizations." ...|$|E

60|$|The Japanese {{are firmly}} persuaded {{that they have}} no friends, and that the Americana are their implacable foes. One gathers that the Government regards war with America as {{unavoidable}} in the long run. The argument would be that the economic imperialism of the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> tolerate the industrial development of a formidable rival in the Pacific, and that sooner or later the Japanese will be presented with the alternative of dying by starvation or on the battlefield. Then Bushido will come into play, and will lead to choice of the battlefield in preference to starvation. Admiral Sato[91] (the Japanese Bernhardi, as he is called) maintains that absence of Bushido in the Americans will lead to their defeat, and that their money-grubbing souls will be incapable of enduring the hardships and privations of a long war. This, of course, is romantic nonsense. Bushido is no use in modern war, and the Americans are quite as courageous and obstinate as the Japanese. A war might last ten years, but it would certainly end in the defeat of Japan.|$|E

In addition, Yale economist Robert Shiller, who wrote Irrational Exuberance (Princeton, 2000) warns that even a 20 or 30 year holding period is not necessarily risk free.
