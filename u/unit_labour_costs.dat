Using industry-specific unit-value ratios (UVRs) we show that labour productivity in Japanese manufacturing lags considerably behind the U. S. and that the Japanese position has worsened during the 1990 s. In 2000, value added per hour worked in Japanese manufacturing stood at 72 percent of the U.

Japanese manufacturing has also suffered from rising <b>unit</b> <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> levels. The long-term trend of a strengthening yen has eroded Japanese cost competitiveness in nearly all branches between 1980 and 2000, although ULC levels have declined somewhat from 1995 onwards due to a more favourable exchange rate development and moderate wage growth in Japan. Still, in 2000 <b>unit</b> <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> in Japanese manufacturing was still 27 percent above the U. S. level.

The labour factor is most expensive in Germany. At ATS 340 per hour of labour, German manufacturers {{pay more than}} a quarter over the Austrian rate. For Austrian manufacturers, a worker's hour costs ATS 270. 40 in 2000, or 2. 75 percent more than the EU average. Non-wage <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> in manufacturing were 90. 2 percent in 2000, a drop of 0. 8 percentage points against 1999, due to lower severance payments. For the Austrian economy, its international position with regard to its <b>unit</b> <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> fluctuated throughout the 1990 s. In {{the first half of the}} last decade, industries in Austria found their situation deteriorating substantially, fuelled by rocketing wage inflation and an appreciation of the schilling in the wake of the EMS crisis, whereas in the second half relative <b>unit</b> <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> came down by 2. 7 percent p. a. compared to the average of Austria's trading partners and calculated in a single currency, the consequence of lower wage inflation, continuously high productivity growth (+ 5. 3 percent p. a.) and a better currency standing. Altogether, the relative unit wage cost position for Austrian manufacturers improved by well over 10 percent in the 1990 s.

50|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which excess money might be translated into inflation are examined below. Individuals can also spend their excess money balances directly on goods and services.

The increase in demand for goods and services may cause a rise in imports.

50|$|Nevertheless, {{there have}} been {{widespread}} misgivings {{about the effects of}} international trade upon wage earners in developed countries. Samuelson‘s factor price equalisation theorem indicates that, if productivity were the same in both countries, the effect of trade would be to bring about equality in wage rates. As noted above, that theorem is sometimes taken to mean that trade between an industrialised country and a developing country would lower the wages of the unskilled in the industrialised country. However, it is unreasonable to assume that productivity would be the same in a low-wage developing country as in a high-wage developed country. A 1999 study has found international differences in wage rates to be approximately matched by corresponding differences in productivity. (Such discrepancies that remained were probably the result of over-valuation or under-valuation of exchange rates, or of inflexibilities in labour markets.) It has been argued that, although there may sometimes be short-term pressures on wage rates in the developed countries, competition between employers in developing countries can be expected eventually to bring wages into line with their employees' marginal products. Any remaining international wage differences would then be the result of productivity differences, so {{that there would be no}} difference between <b>unit</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> in developing and developed countries, and no downward pressure on wages in the developed countries.|$|E

5000|$|Flassbeck views a {{currency}} union primarily as an [...] "inflation community". This {{means that all}} member countries of a monetary union had to show the same price change rate. That could only be achieved by equalisation of growth of <b>unit</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs,</b> with the aim to maintain the price competitiveness of all countries and to avoid high current account surpluses as well as deficits. As consequence for the eurozone he requests that all euro states had {{to comply with the}} Central Bank's target inflation rate. Because Germany had seriously undershot this target inflation rate through its concept of [...] "wage restraint" [...] since introduction of the monetary union, while other countries have met or slightly exceeded it, the German industry had gained market share on a large scale to the expense of the other countries in the eurozone. As solution for this problem, which he considers as the fundamental cause of the euro crisis, he proposes coordination of wage policies in the European monetary union. In view of the facts that the option of revalautions and devaluations is not given anymore because of the abolition of national currencies, the only alternative was a real devaluation of states with high current account deficits such as Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy, as well as a real revaluation of Germany — brought by steadily higher wage increases in Germany than in the other eurozone countries.|$|E

40|$|Various {{international}} {{institutions such as}} the European Commission, the ECB and the OECD often use <b>unit</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> as a measure of international competitiveness. The goal of this paper was to examine how well this measure is related to international export performance at the firm level. To this end, we use Belgian firm-level data for the period 1999 to 2010 to analyse the impact of <b>unit</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> on exports. We find an estimated elasticity of the intensive margin of exports with respect to <b>unit</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> between − 0. 2 and − 0. 4. This elasticity varies between sectors and between firms, with more labour-intensive firms having a higher elasticity. The microdata also enable us to analyse the impact of <b>unit</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> on the extensive margin. Our results show that higher <b>unit</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> reduce the probability of starting to export for non-exporters and increase the probability of exporters stopping. While our results show that <b>unit</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> {{have an impact on the}} intensive margin and extensive margin of firm-level exports, the effect is rather low, suggesting that pass-through of costs into prices is limited. The latter is consistent with recent trade models emphasising that not only relative costs, but also demand factors such as quality and taste matter for explaining firm-level exports.
