40|$|This article pursues an antihermeneutic {{conception}} of Socratic irony that troubles the borders between pedagogical authority and humility. One {{of the most}} tenacious ways of troping the teacher-student relation, Socratic irony is often figured {{as a way for}} a masterful teacher to exercise authority over a student. Drawing on the writings of Søren Kierkegaard and Avital Ronell, this article repositions such irony as an uncontrollability in language itself—one that can humble and humiliate teacher and student alike. Via divergent readings of Plato’s Gorgias and Aristophanes’ Clouds, as well as Bruno Latour’s interpretation of the former, I question how this approach to Socratic irony might re- and <b>unwork</b> rhetoricians’ positions of mastery with regard to both students and systematized bodies of knowledge...|$|R

5|$|Constructing a warship of {{the size}} of the Mary Rose was a major undertaking, {{requiring}} vast quantities of high-quality material. In the case of building a state-of-the-art warship, these materials were primarily oak. The total amount of timber needed for the construction can only be roughly calculated since only about one third of the ship still exists. One estimate for the number of trees is around 600 mostly large oaks, representing about 16 hectares (40 acres) of woodland. The huge trees that had been common in Europe and the British Isles in previous centuries were by the 16th century quite rare, which meant that timbers were brought in from all over southern England. The largest timbers used in the construction were of roughly the same size as those used in the roofs of the largest cathedrals in the high Middle Ages. An <b>unworked</b> hull plank would have weighed over 300kg (660lb), and one of the main deck beams would have weighed close to three-quarters of a tonne.|$|E
40|$|Drawing on the {{writings}} of Bruno Latour and Bill Brown, this article discusses the material turn in contemporary criticism and literature in two related steps. On a general level, it sketches the contours of a reading method capable of describing the remarkably complex role of material objects in the modern novel, paying {{particular attention to the}} circulation of objects, the tension between ‘objects’ and ‘things’ and the ambiguous ontological status of these recalcitrant items. These insights are then applied to a set of contemporary novels in Dutch written by Willem van Zadelhoff, Koen Peeters and Miek Zwamborn. These novels not only share a pronounced interest in memory, non-fiction and the supposedly non-commercial space of the museum, but also in objects as diverse as modernist chairs, ethnic baskets and uncaring stones. A closer look at these objects demonstrates that material culture is not just important for readers interested in nineteenth-century interiors, as the representation of ‘object cultures’ {{can also be used to}} establish, complicate and <b>unwork</b> our ideas about topics like modernist architecture, postcolonial trauma and planetary history...|$|R
40|$|Videogame tinkerers, players, {{and activists}} of the 21 st century are continuing, yet redefining, the avant-garde art and {{literary}} {{movements of the}} 20 th century. Videogames are diverging as a social, cultural, and digital medium. They are used as political instruments, artistic experiments, social catalysts, and personal means of expression. A diverse field of games and technocultural play, such as alternate reality games, griefer attacks, arcade sculptures, and so on, can be compared and contrasted to the avant-garde, such as contemporary tactical media, net art, video art, Fluxus, the Situationists, the work of Pollock or Brecht, Dada, or the Russian Formalists. For example, historical avant-garde painters played with perspectival space (and its traditions), rather than only within those grid-like spaces. This is {{similar in some ways}} to how game artists play with flow (and player expectations of it), rather than advancing flow as the popular and academic ideal. Videogames are not only an advanced product of technoculture, but are the space in which technoculture conventionalizes play. This makes them a fascinating site to <b>unwork</b> and rethink the protocols and rituals that rule technoculture. It is the audacity of imagining certain videogames as avant-garde (from the perspective of mainstream consumers and art academics alike) that makes them a good candidate for this critical experiment.

5|$|Late glacial tool finds {{from the}} Upper Palaeolithic date to c.12,000BP: flint blades known as Cheddar points; smaller bladelets known as Cresswell points; scrapers; burins or lithic flakes; flint and bone awls; and a bone needle.

5|$|These {{troubles}} {{were followed}} in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread throughout Europe {{during the following}} three years. The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe, {{about one-third of the}} population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left <b>unworked.</b> Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, both of which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague {{throughout the rest of the}} 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages.|$|E

500|$|The {{construction}} of defensive structures was closely {{linked with the}} establishment of the palatial centers in mainland Greece. The principal Mycenaean centers were well-fortified and usually situated on an elevated terrain, such as in Athens, Tiryns and Mycenae or on coastal plains, in the case of Gla. Mycenaean Greeks appreciated the symbolism of war as expressed in defensive architecture, thus they aimed also at the visual impressiveness of their fortifications. The walls were built in Cyclopean style; consisted of walls built of large, <b>unworked</b> boulders more than [...] thick and weighing several metric tonnes. The term Cyclopean was derived by the Greeks of the classical era who believed that only the mythical giants, the Cyclops, could have constructed such megalithic structures. On the other hand, cut stone masonry is used only in and around gateways.|$|E
500|$|Cyclopean is {{the term}} {{normally}} applied to the masonry characteristics of Mycenaean fortification systems and describes walls built of large, <b>unworked</b> boulders more than [...] thick and weighing several metric tonnes. They were roughly fitted together {{without the use of}} mortar or clay to bind them, though smaller hunks of limestone fill the interstices. Their placement formed a polygonal pattern giving the curtain wall an irregular but imposing appearance. At the top it would have been wide enough for a walkway with a narrow protective parapet on the outer edge and with hoop-like crenellations. The term Cyclopean was derived by the latter Greeks of the Classical era who believed that only the mythical giants, the Cyclopes, could have constructed such megalithic structures. On the other hand, cut stone masonry is used only in and around gateways. Another typical feature of Mycenaean megalithic construction was the use of a relieving triangle above a lintel block—an opening, often triangular, designed to reduce the weight over the lintel. The space was filled with some lighter stone.|$|E
500|$|El Greco's re-evaluation was {{not limited}} to scholars. According to Efi Foundoulaki, [...] "painters and theoreticians from the {{beginning}} of the 20th century 'discovered' a new El Greco but in process they also discovered and revealed their own selves". His expressiveness and colors influenced Eugène Delacroix and Édouard Manet. To the Blaue Reiter group in Munich in 1912, El Greco typified that mystical inner construction that it was the task of their generation to rediscover. The first painter who appears to have noticed the structural code in the morphology of the mature El Greco was Paul Cézanne, one of the forerunners of cubism. Comparative morphological analyses of the two painters revealed their common elements, such as the distortion of the human body, the reddish and (in appearance only) <b>unworked</b> backgrounds and the similarities in the rendering of space. According to Brown, [...] "Cézanne and El Greco are spiritual brothers despite the centuries which separate them". Fry observed that Cézanne drew from [...] "his great discovery of the permeation of every part of the design with a uniform and continuous plastic theme".|$|E

2500|$|The deputy barmasters were {{responsible}} for settling disputes over ownership or of arresting or suspending operation of mines pending decisions of the Barmote Court. They could withdraw title whenever a mine was left <b>unworked.</b> They checked the mines regularly and used their knives to nick the stows at any neglected mine. After three nicks at weekly intervals title could be transferred to another miner. The mining rules required working shareholders in a mine to pull their weight. Any who did not were dispossessed, after a warning at the Barmote Court. Typical was this injunction from the court on 2 April 1630: [...] "Wee saie that Thomas Taylor Henry Lowe and John Wooley shall come within tenn daies of warning given them by the Barrmaster and shall keepe Thomas Redforde companie at their groves in Home Rake or else to loose theire parte" ...|$|E

De Mortillet emphasised the importance of the presence or absence of the cortex around the edge in the 19th century: [...] "Even on some of the best worked pieces it is common to see, sometimes on the base but more often on the side, a small area that has not been worked, that is uncut. It could be thought that this is a mistake or an error. But often the most probable reason for this is that it was intentional. There are a large number of hand axes with an uncut base, <b>unworked</b> or partially cleaned ... an area has intentionally been left on these pieces as a grip, it is called the heel.

2500|$|The Texas Folklore Society grew {{gradually}} {{over the}} next decade, with Lomax steering it forward. At his invitation, Kittredge and Wendell attended its meetings. Other early members were Stith Thompson and J. Frank Dobie, who both began teaching English at the university in 1914. In 1915, at Lomax's recommendation, Stith Thompson became the society's secretary-treasurer. In 1916, Lomax's voluminous encyclopedia, , which he had written jointly with , was published. The same year, Stith Thompson edited {{the first volume of}} the Publications of the Texas Folklore Society, which Dobie reissued as Round the Levee in 1935. This publication exemplified the society's express purpose, and the motivation behind Lomax's own work: to gather a body of folklore before it disappeared, and to preserve it for the analysis of later scholars. These early efforts foreshadowed what would become Lomax's greatest achievement, the collection of more than ten thousand recordings for the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress. In the inaugural issue of the Publications of the Texas Folklore Society, John A. Lomax urged the collection of Texas folklore: [...] "Two rich and practically <b>unworked</b> fields in Texas are found in the large Negro and Mexican populations of the state." [...] He adds, [...] "Here are many problems of research that lie close at hand, not buried in musty tomes and incomplete records, but in vital human personalities." ...|$|E
