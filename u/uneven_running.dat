5|$|Taonere Banda was {{the first}} Malawian Paralympic athlete to compete at the quadrennial event. She {{qualified}} for the games by using a wildcard because the country {{did not have any}} athletes who met the qualification standards. Banda spent the 60 days in the buildup to Rio training for the event, but amenities in Malawi were imperfect and she trained on a dusty, <b>uneven</b> <b>running</b> track without standard defined lanes. She stated that it had been her childhood ambition to represent Malawi at a major international sporting event and this was her sole opportunity to prove her athletic abilities in her event, the 1500 metres (T13). Banda was drawn in the first heat on 8 September. She attacked the first lap aggressively taking up a commanding lead, but her initial speed saw her tire in the latter stages and she lost the lead in the last 600 metres of the race to finish fourth. Banda was later disqualified when she was observed to leave her lane during the heat. Nevertheless, she said that when she returned to Malawi, she would encourage people with disabilities to work hard and participate in sporting events.|$|E
5000|$|Frost heaves (swelling of {{wet soil}} upon freezing) produce an <b>uneven</b> <b>running</b> surface causing an {{irregular}} rocking motion as trains moved past. A wider wheelbase offered a steadier ride with less wear on the machinery and roadbed.|$|E
5000|$|Four {{years later}} she {{qualified}} for the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, competing in the 1500 metres race (T13). In the buildup to the Games she {{had the opportunity to}} attend a training camp, and funding allowed her and her coach to travel to Brazil to become Malawi's first Paralympic athlete. The significance of her achievement was celebrated by the Malawi Paralympics Committee, who confirmed Banda's selection at a special event at the National Sports Council in Blantyre on 4 July 2016. She spent the 60 days in the buildup to Rio training for the event, but amenities in Malawi were imperfect and she trained on a dusty, <b>uneven</b> <b>running</b> track without standard defined lanes.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} their {{relatively}} simple design Klien-Lindner axles were not widely used. Derailments were common when they were used as leading axles. The axles often caused <b>uneven,</b> jerky <b>running</b> {{as a result of}} the resistance forces that arise from this type of Cardan joint, and they were expensive to maintain, something which was not offset by the reduced wear and tear on wheel flanges and rails.|$|R
25|$|Stirling is an oddly-shaped suburb {{carved out}} of western Balcatta and {{northern}} Osborne Park. It is bounded Mitchell Freeway between Erindale Road and Hutton Street on the west and south, Amelia and Poincaire Streets to the north, and an <b>uneven</b> line <b>running</b> roughly south from Jones Street's north-south section to the east. Lake estates and public parks, including the Stirling Civic Gardens, make up a moderate percentage of the suburb's area.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 23 mm. The forewings are dark purplish fuscous suffusedly mixed with blackish {{and with a}} bright yellow stripe of <b>uneven</b> width <b>running</b> all around the costa and termen to near the tornus, widest near the base and at the apex, attenuated towards the extremity, the lower edge suffused with fulvous brown. There is a bright red oval spot in the disc before the middle, edged beneath by an elongate sometimes interrupted snow-white mark, its anterior extremity enlarged and surrounded by scattered crimson scales. The second discal stigma is curved, transverse and indicated by obscure crimson edging. The hindwings are dark grey with the cell whitish grey, tinged posteriorly with rosy.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the origin of “shakedown cruise” comes from the need to settle (or literally shake down) the ballast in the hold of a ship to ensure it is level in the water. However, this would only apply to very granular ballast material such as sand. The term is more likely to have arisen due to the transition from sail to power. The advent of engines within the hull of a ship caused severe vibration. Such vibration would be aggravated by <b>uneven</b> <b>running</b> and different sea conditions. A new ship had many fixtures and fittings throughout its accommodation and work spaces. As the maiden voyage progressed, these would become loose, and in many cases fall to the deck (shaken down). For this reason, it was common for the shipyard to send a 'shake-down' team with the ship on her maiden voyage. These men would be specialists equipped with the proper tools and spares to relocate or replace any shake-down displaced fixtures or fittings.|$|E
50|$|As RNA {{integrity}} {{has long}} been known to be a problem in molecular biology studies, there are a few methods that have been used historically to determine the integrity of RNA. The most popular {{has long been}} agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining, allowing one to visualize the bands from the rRNA peaks. The height of the 28S and 18S bands can be compared to each other, with a 2:1 ratio indicating non-degraded RNA. While this method is very cheap and easy, there are several issues with this method, primarily its subjectivity, leading to inconsistent, non-standardized RNA quality assessments, and the large amounts of RNA that are needed to visualize it on an agarose gel, which can be problematic if there is not much RNA to work with. There are also a number of different problems that can arise from agarose gel electrophoresis, such as poor loading, <b>uneven</b> <b>running,</b> and uneven staining that lead to increased variability in the accuracy of using agarose gel electrophoresis to determine RNA integrity. Clearly, a standardized, repeatable, objective method of determining RNA integrity was needed.|$|E

40|$|Humans {{navigate}} {{uneven terrain}} {{in their everyday}} lives. From trails, grass, and uneven sidewalks, we constantly adapt to various surfaces in our environment. Past {{research has shown that}} walking on natural terrain, compared to walking on smooth flat surfaces, results in increased energy expenditure during locomotion. However, the biomechanical adaptations responsible for this energetic increase are unclear, since locomotion research is often conducted either on short walkways or in an outdoor setting, thus limiting data collections. To further our understanding of human locomotion on uneven terrain, I focused on quantifying the biomechanical and energetic changes due to increased terrain variability during walking and running. First, this thesis presents modifications to a regular exercise treadmill to allow for attachment of a separate uneven surface. Using this treadmill, I collected kinetic, kinematic, electromyographic, and energy expenditure data during continuous human walking and running. I showed that humans walking at 1. 0 m/s on an uneven surface, with a 2. 5 cm height variability, increased energy expenditure by 0. 73 W/kg (approx. 28 %) compared to walking on smooth terrain. Greater energy expenditure was primarily caused by increased positive work at the hip and knee, with minor contributions from increased muscle activity and step parameter adaptations. I then showed that running at 2. 3 m/s on the same surface resulted in an energetic increase of 0. 48 W/kg (approx. 5 %) compared to running on even terrain. In contrast to walking, humans compensated for <b>uneven</b> terrain during <b>running</b> by reducing positive work produced by the ankle and adapting a more crouched leg posture. The similar absolute increases in energetic cost between walking and running implied that much of this increase is likely due to surface height variability and changes in mechanical work. Finally, this work presents analytical and simulated analyses for the rimless wheel and simplest walker models. These analyses explored the relationship between gait dynamics, energy input strategies, surface unevenness and the energetic cost of walking. Together, these studies advance our understanding of the relationship between mechanics and energetics of human walking on uneven surfaces and could potentially lead to more robust and energetically efficient legged robots, prostheses and more effective clinical rehabilitation interventions...|$|R
40|$|Differences in the {{combustion}} process from one cycle to the next, termed cyclic variations, {{are an important}} feature of spark ignition engines. These variations cause fluctuations in the work {{output of the engine}} and can therefore degrade engine and vehicle performance. In addition, the <b>uneven</b> <b>running</b> caused by cyclic variability of combustion constrains the engine operating range and thus has a direct effect on fuel consumption. Existing one-dimensional engine models typically represent cyclic variability using some form of stochastic behaviour defined by a pre-set normal distribution. This approach does not offer an insight into the mechanisms underlying variability, and makes it difficult to include variability when calibrating the engine using simulation. Three-dimensional modelling approaches can offer an insight but are too complex to be used extensively within a calibration exercise. In this paper, a simple, preliminary approach using empirical functions easily generated using standard engine instrumentation is used to augment a one-dimensional engine model via co-simulation approach to include a representation {{of the effects of the}} air-fuel ratio and residual gas fraction on combustion efficiency, early rate of combustion and duration of combustion. These parameters allow the engine model to simulate the effects of deterministic aspects of cyclic variability on heat release, in-cylinder pressure and indicated mean effective pressure. The model is validated by comparing its prediction of cyclic variability under both rich and lean operation to experimental data. The resulting predictions match experimental results qualitatively and quantitatively. The model can be used to inform subsequent optimization processes, representing the variability-induced constraints on the operating envelope. This will assist in the generation of fuel efficient calibrations and also allow cycle-to-cycle variation effects to be included much earlier in the design process. The model will also aid the development of online control approaches aiming to reduce cycle-to-cycle engine variability...|$|E
