5|$|Former {{incumbent}} Milton Obote won the 1980 <b>Ugandan</b> general election. Museveni {{disputed the}} result, {{and he and}} his followers withdrew from the new government in protest. In 1981, Museveni formed the rebel National Resistance Army (NRA); Kagame and Rwigyema joined as founding soldiers, along with thirty-eight Ugandans. The army's goal was to overthrow Obote's government, in {{what became known as the}} <b>Ugandan</b> Bush War.|$|E
5|$|Groups of anti-Rwandan {{government}} rebels {{like the}} FDLR, {{and other foreign}} fighters remain inside the DRC. The FDLR which is the greatest concern, was some 6,000 strong, in July 2007. By late 2010 the FDLR's strength however was estimated at 2,500. The other groups are smaller: the <b>Ugandan</b> Lord's Resistance Army, the <b>Ugandan</b> rebel group the Allied Democratic Forces in the remote area of Mt Rwenzori, and the Burundian Parti pour la Libération du Peuple Hutu—Forces Nationales de Liberation (PALIPEHUTU-FNL).|$|E
5|$|Kagame {{spent most}} of his {{childhood}} and young adult years living in Uganda, and has a personal relationship with President Yoweri Museveni dating back to the late 1970s; they fought together in the <b>Ugandan</b> Bush War, and Kagame was appointed head of military intelligence in Museveni's national army following the NRA victory in 1986. When the RPF soldiers abandoned the <b>Ugandan</b> army and invaded Rwanda in 1990, Museveni did not explicitly support them, but according to Prunier it is likely that he had prior knowledge of the plan. Museveni also allowed the RPF safe passage through <b>Ugandan</b> territory to the Virunga mountains after their early defeats in the war, and revealed in a 1998 heads of state meeting that Uganda had helped the RPF materially during the Rwandan Civil War. Following the RPF victory, the two countries enjoyed a close political and trade relationship.|$|E

5|$|On 4 August 1972, Amin {{issued a}} decree {{ordering}} {{the expulsion of}} the 50,000 Asians who were British passport holders. This was later amended to include all 60,000 Asians who were not <b>Ugandan</b> citizens. Around 30,000 <b>Ugandan</b> Asians emigrated to the UK. Others went to Commonwealth countries such as Australia, South Africa, Canada, and Fiji, or to India, Kenya, Pakistan, Sweden, Tanzania, and the United States. Amin expropriated businesses and properties belonging to the Asians and the Europeans and handed them over to his supporters. The businesses were mismanaged, and industries collapsed from lack of maintenance. This proved disastrous for the already declining economy.|$|E
5|$|One {{point of}} {{criticism}} {{is that the}} film gives a misleading impression of the whereabouts and magnitude of Kony's remaining LRA forces. As of early 2012, Kony's followers were thought to number only in the hundreds, and Kony himself {{was believed to be}} in the Central African Republic rather than Uganda—a fact that receives only a passing mention in the video. This problem raised questions about the plausibility of <b>Ugandan</b> army intervention, which the video advocates. Since Kony and most of the LRA forces are currently not in Uganda, the <b>Ugandan</b> army would need to coordinate with the governments and militaries of the other countries where the LRA is active.|$|E
5|$|The army {{grew from}} 10,000 to 25,000 by 1978. Amin's army {{was largely a}} {{mercenary}} force. Half the soldiers were South Sudanese and 26 percent Congolese, with only 24 percent being <b>Ugandan,</b> mostly Muslim and Kakwa.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{statistics}} {{indicate that}} these <b>Ugandans</b> {{have become the}} country's biggest contributors to the economy, amounting to US$1 billion in annual remittances. North America has become home to many <b>Ugandans.</b> The <b>Ugandans</b> accomplished the goals that {{brought them to the}} US or Canada. This has prompted them to forge solidities, associations, clubs and brotherhood to foster unity and maintain connectivity to their motherland. The solidarities are based on cultural/ethnic backgrounds, with UNAA as the umbrella association that houses all <b>Ugandans</b> regardless their background, creed, tribe and/or social status. On the month of August have place three major events that bring together the <b>Ugandans</b> in North America in rather spectacular flair. These festivities include the Ttabamiruka, the International Community of Banyakigezi and the Uganda North American Association convention.|$|R
50|$|There {{was very}} little {{migration}} from Uganda before 1960. In the 1960s there was a gradual growth of <b>Ugandans</b> that immigrated to Australia largely for political reasons, and for many it was for further studies, predominantly graduate school. Immigration records from 1985 cite <b>Ugandans</b> separately from other Africans and show the arrival of 859 immigrants, most fleeing Idi Amin's terror. Of note {{is the fact that}} Afro Asian, a group encompassing all brown-skinned people, usually Indians, Pakistani, and Konkani of Goa, are counted in a separate category from <b>Ugandans,</b> although many of them came from Uganda. In 1976, 359 <b>Ugandans</b> arrived, and 241 came in 1977. Immigration fell to less than 150 each year in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a time of political stability in Uganda.|$|R

5|$|Kagame {{began his}} primary {{education}} in a school near the refugee camp, where he and other Rwandan refugees learned English and began to integrate into <b>Ugandan</b> culture. At the age of nine {{he moved to the}} respected Rwengoro Primary School, around 16 kilometres (10 mi) away, graduating with the best grades in the district. He subsequently attended Ntare School, one of the best schools in Uganda. It is also the alma mater of future <b>Ugandan</b> President Yoweri Museveni. The death of Kagame's father in the early 1970s, and the departure of Rwigyema to an unknown location, led to a decline in his academic performance and an increased tendency to fight those who belittled the Rwandan population. He was eventually suspended from Ntare and completed his studies without distinction at Old Kampala Secondary School.|$|E
5|$|Kagame {{was born}} to a Tutsi family in {{southern}} Rwanda. His mother was younger sister to King Ndahindurwa's wife. When he was two years old, the Rwandan Revolution ended centuries of Tutsi political dominance; his family fled to Uganda, where he {{spent the rest of}} his childhood. In the 1980s, Kagame fought in Yoweri Museveni's rebel army, becoming a senior <b>Ugandan</b> army officer after Museveni's military victories carried him to the <b>Ugandan</b> presidency. Kagame joined the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which invaded Rwanda in 1990; leader Fred Rwigyema died early in the war and Kagame took control. By 1993, the RPF controlled significant territory in Rwanda and a ceasefire was negotiated. The assassination of Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was the starting point of the genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed {{a little more than a}} million Tutsi and moderate Hutu combined. Kagame resumed the civil war, and ended the genocide with a military victory.|$|E
40|$|Uganda´s {{well-being}} {{ranks among}} {{the worst in the}} world, while Sweden´s well-being {{ranks among the}} best. This thesis investigates if there is a difference in well-being and dispositional optimism in Uganda and Sweden. The neurobiology underlying well-being and optimism is also examined. The neural correlations of well-being and optimism are connected to areas in the limbic system and cerebral cortex. Prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex are two curial regions involved in both well-being and optimism. Amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and thalamus are central areas for hedonic well-being, dispositional optimism, and optimism bias. In this thesis 284 <b>Ugandans</b> and 256 Swedes completed a questionnaire based survey. Greater hedonic well-being was found among Swedes, whereas greater eudiamonic well-being was found among <b>Ugandans.</b> Swedes reported greater global life satisfaction than <b>Ugandans,</b> but <b>Ugandans</b> expressed higher satisfaction with their current lives compared with Swedes. In relation to dispositional optimism, <b>Ugandans</b> were found to be both more optimistic and more pessimistic than Swedes. This unexpected dispositional optimism pattern is discussed and future research directions are proposed...|$|R
50|$|Many <b>Ugandans</b> {{were aware}} of the Central African Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (later Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi) and its {{domination}} by white settler interests. <b>Ugandans</b> deeply feared the prospect of recognize that its special status would have to be sacrificed in the interests of a new and larger nation-state.|$|R

5000|$|In 1989, President Yoweri Museveni {{appealed to}} Uganda's Muslim {{community}} {{to contribute to}} national reconstruction, and he warned other <b>Ugandans</b> not to discriminate against Muslims.

5|$|The foreign {{media were}} often criticised by <b>Ugandan</b> exiles and defectors for {{emphasizing}} Amin's self-aggrandizing eccentricities and taste for excess while downplaying or excusing his murderous behavior.

5|$|Although {{his primary}} reason for {{military}} action in Zaire was {{the dismantling of the}} refugee camps, Kagame also began planning a war to remove long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. Mobutu had supported the genocidaires based in the camps, and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. Together with <b>Ugandan</b> President Yoweri Museveni, Kagame supported the newly created Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL), an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. The ADFL, helped by Rwandan and <b>Ugandan</b> troops, took control of North and South Kivu provinces in November 1996 and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting. By May 1997, they controlled almost the whole of Zaire except for the capital Kinshasa; Mobutu fled and the ADFL took the capital without fighting. The country was renamed as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Kabila became the new president. The Rwandan Defence Forces and the ADFL were accused of carrying out mass atrocities during the First Congo War, with as many as 222,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees declared missing.|$|E
5|$|Bush was {{described}} as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of Great Britain and Vicente Fox of Mexico, although formal relations were sometimes strained.

Later in Bush's presidency, tensions arose between him and Vladimir Putin, {{which led to a}} cooling of their relationship.|$|E
