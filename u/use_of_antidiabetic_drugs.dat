RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODS — Data on oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> were derived from two pharmaceutical marketing databases from IMS Health, the National Prescription Audit Plus and the National Disease and Therapeutic Index. RESULTS — In 1990, 23. 4 million outpatient prescriptions <b>of</b> oral <b>antidiabetic</b> agents were dispensed. By 2001, this number had increased 3. 9 -fold, to 91. 8 million prescriptions. Glipizide and glyburide, two sulfonylurea medications, accounted for 77 % of prescriptions <b>of</b> oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> in 1990 and 35. 5 % of prescriptions in 2001. By 2001, the biguanide met-formin (approved in 1995) had captured 33 % of prescriptions, and the thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizers (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone marketed beginning in 1999) accounted for 17 % of market share.

40|$|Introduction: The {{evaluation}} {{of the relationship between}} the use of antidiabetic drug and the occurrence of cancer is extremely challenging, both from the clinical and pharmacoepidemiological standpoint. This narrative review described the current evidence supporting a relationship between the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> and the incidence of solid cancers. Areas covered: Data from pharmacoepidemiological studies on cancer incidence were presented for the main antidiabetic drugs and drug classes, including human insulin and insulin analogues, metformin, sulfonylureas, glinides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, incretin mimetics, and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors. The relationship between the use of antidiabetics and the incidence of solid cancer was described in strata by any cancer and by organ-specific cancer and by drug and by drug classes. Information supporting biological evidence and putative mechanisms were also provided. Expert opinion: The history of exploration of the relationship between antidiabetic drugs and the risk of solid cancers has showed several issues. Unrecognized biases and misinterpretations of study results have had important consequences that delayed the identification of actual risk and benefits of the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> associated with cancer occurrence or progression. The lesson learned from the past should address the future research in this area, since in the majority of cases findings are controversial and confirmatory studies are warranted...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A new simple {{technique}} {{based on}} iontophoresis technology (EZSCAN, Impeto Medical, Paris, France) {{has recently been}} developed for the screening of diabetes. In the present study, we investigated the accuracy of this system for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in Chinese. Methods We performed the EZSCAN test in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. EZSCAN measures electrochemical conductance (EC) at forehead, hands and feet, and derives a diabetes index with a value ranging from 0 to 100. Diabetes mellitus {{was defined as a}} plasma glucose concentration of at least 7 mmol/l at fasting or 11. 1 mmol/l at 2 hours after glucose load, or as the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Results The 195 study participants (51 % men, mean age 52 years) included 75 diabetic patients (<b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> 81 %) and 120 non-diabetic subjects. EC (micro Siemens, μSi) was significantly (P P = 0. 39). When a diabetes index of 40 (suggested by the manufacturer) was used as the threshold, the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was 85 % and 64 %, respectively. In 80 patients who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, EC at hands and feet and the diabetes index were significantly (P Conclusions EZSCAN might be useful in screening diabetes mellitus with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. </p...|$|E

40|$|Case report A 49 -year-old {{previously}} healthy man {{was admitted}} to the ICU after cardiac arrest following a short history with headache, blurred speech and reduced consciousness. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation perfusion rhythm was regained, but the patient didn`t regain consciousness. The arterial blood gas analysis at the ICU revealed a severe metabolic acidosis with pH at 6. 86 and lactate levels of 16 mmol/L. The white blood cells count was also markedly increased (312 * 109 /L), and blood smear showed immature cells indicating acute leukemia. The severe metabolic acidosis, at first thought to be due to systemic hypoperfusion, did not improve in spite of fluid and vasopressor resuscitation. A CT scan of the head performed the next day, revealed massive cerebellar haemorrhage, edema in both hemispheres and signs of anoxic brain damage. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood was consistent with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Discussion Lactic acidosis is a common cause of metabolic acidosis at the ICU. Type A is most common and caused by hypoperfusion or hypoxia, whilst type B has other causes including <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drug</b> metformin and hematological malignancies.

Meanwhile, insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents are high-alert medications. Therefore {{it is necessary}} to require a multidisciplinary team’s integrated endeavors to enhance safe medication management and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Methods: A 5 -year stewardship intervention program, including organizational measures and quality improvement activities in storage, prescription, dispensing, administration, and monitoring, was performed in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, People’s Republic of China, a 3, 200 -bed hospital with 3. 5 million outpatient visits annually. Results: The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University has obtained a 100 % implementation rate of standard storage of antidiabetic drugs in the Pharmacy and wards since August 2012. A zero occurrence of dispensing errors related to highly “look-alike” and “sound-alike” NovoMix 30 ® (biphasic insulin aspart) and NovoRapid® (insulin aspart) has been achieved since October 2011. Insulin injection accuracy among ward nurses significantly increased from 82 % (first quarter 2011) to 96 % (fourth quarter 2011) (P 10 seconds (99. 4 %), and using the pen needle only once (88. 7 %).

40|$|Abstract: Breast {{cancer is}} the female {{malignant}} neoplasia with the highest incidence in the industrialized world. Although early diagnosis has contributed to therapeutic success, breast cancer remains a major health issue. In the last few year the hormone therapy for estrogen-dependent breast cancer has evolved achieving significant clinical results; at the same time, it has enabled us to better define the role of estrogens in the etiopathogenesis of this tumour. Weight increase and obesity {{have been identified as}} the most important risk and prognostic factors for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the association of obesity with postmenopausal breast cancer. Specific obesity-associated factors, including leptin, insulin and inflammatory mediators, seem to influence breast cancer growth and prognosis independently of estrogens and at least in part by interacting with estrogen signalling at a cellular level. Therefore, a careful assessment of the nutritional status and body composition is paramount for a proper therapeutic approach for postmenopausal breast carcinoma. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> and anti-inflammatory <b>drugs</b> associated with conventional hormone therapies and dietary/physical interventions could offer a new therapeutic approach for breast carcinoma that develops in the context of adiposity...|$|R

30|$|The {{study has}} {{important}} limitations. First, we studied postmortem adipose tissue biopsies from critically ill patients. Although biopsies were harvested minutes after death, we cannot exclude the interference of agonal hypoxia with our results. However, such interference would have similarly affected samples from lean and overweight/obese patients. Furthermore, increased adipogenesis was also observed in in vivo adipose tissue biopsies from critically ill patients [5, 7]. Secondly, since we mainly studied overweight to mildly obese patients, possibly severely to morbidly obese patients might display a different adipogenic response. However, the {{findings on the}} protection against muscle wasting and weakness were also observed in an overweight/obese patient population with a similar BMI range as the current study [6]. Thirdly, although patients were matched {{for the presence of}} diabetes, information on the type of diabetes and on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs,</b> such as thiazolidinediones, prior to ICU stay, is missing, both of which might have affected adipogenesis in these patients. Lastly, our in vitro study was designed to mimic the complex and multifactorial condition of critical illness. Although this in vitro setup enables us to get a global overview of the adipogenic response during critical illness, it cannot distinguish between specific effects of individual factors present in the serum of critically ill patients.|$|E

Objective: To implement and validate a UPLC-UV method to quantify metformin and glyburide in blood samples. Materials and methods: Only a 0. 1 mL-volume blood sample was used. Both drugs are removed by precipitation with methanol. Quantitation was carried out with mobile phase of 4. 6 mM potassium phosphate monobasic (KH 2 PO 4) 0. 1 M pH = 6. 5, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and acetonitrile (63 : 7 : 30), at 0. 8 mL/min through a VARIAN Pursuit® C 8 150 x 3. 9 mm column at 40 °C, 236 nm. Results: The method allows the measurement of 20 to 600 nanograms of metformin and from 100 to 2 000 nanograms of glyburide per milliliter of blood.

40|$|What {{is already}} {{known about this}} subject • Increasing <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> use in youths has been {{reported}} in the USA, however {{there is a lack of}} epidemiological evidence in the UK. • There is an increase in the prevalence of both type 1 and 2 diabetes, but precise estimates are difficult to obtain and as such are uninformative for future health services planning. What this study adds • The prevalence of children receiving insulin and oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> has increased twofold and eightfold, respectively, between 1998 and 2005. • The data reflect the prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes rapidly increase in recent years. • The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> increases with increasing age, especially among those aged 12 - 18 years. • Consideration needs to be given to the funding and design of future services for children and particularly adolescents with diabetes to take account of these epidemiological findings. Aims: Despite evidence of an increase in the incidence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in youths, there are few data on the prevalence of either type in children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of childhood diabetes over an 8 -year period in the UK. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study that covered 8 years (January 1998 to December 2005) of UK IMS Disease Analyzer (IMS DA) data. The cohort comprised all children and adolescents aged 0 - 18 years who received at least one <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drug</b> prescription during the study period. The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drug</b> prescribing was <b>used</b> as a proxy for diabetes itself. Results: Data were available on 505 754 children aged 0 - 18 years and a total <b>of</b> 37 225 <b>antidiabetic</b> prescriptions were issued. Insulin use increased significantly from 1. 08 per 1000 children [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 96, 1. 20] in 1998 to 1. 98 (95 % CI 1. 80, 2. 10) in 2005 (P < 0. 001), more markedly in those aged 12 and 18 years. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> for diabetes treatment rose significantly from 0. 006 per 1000 children in 1998 (95 % CI 0. 0043, 0. 017) to 0. 05 (95 % CI 0. 025, 0. 080) (P < 0. 001) in 2005. Conclusions: This study indicates a significant increase in prevalence on both type 1 and type 2 diabetes treatment in children and adolescents in the UK. Thus, this supporting evidence from other sources that the prevalence of childhood diabetes is rising rapidly.

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} effects of telephonedelivered {{lifestyle}} coaching on preventing the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) in participants with impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Design: Cluster randomised trial. Setting: 40 groups from 17 healthcare divisions in Japan: companies (31), communities (6) and mixed settings (3). Participants: Participants aged 20 - 65 years with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 5. 6 - 6. 9 mmol/L were invited from the 17 healthcare divisions. Randomisation: The groups were then randomly assigned to an intervention or a control arm by independent statisticians according to a computergenerated list. Intervention: The intervention arm received a 1 -year telephone-delivered intervention provided by three private lifestyle support centres (at different frequencies: low-frequency (3 times), middle-frequency (6 times) and high-frequency (10 times) support calls). The intervention and control arms both received selfhelp devices such as a weight scale and pedometer. Outcomes: Participants were followed up using data from annual health check-ups and a questionnaire regarding lifestyle. The primary outcome was the development of T 2 DM defined as FPG ≥ 7. 0 mmol/L, the diagnosis <b>of</b> diabetes, or <b>use</b> <b>of</b> an <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drug,</b> confirmed by referring to medical cards. Results: Of 14 473 screened individuals, participants were enrolled in either the intervention (n= 1240) arm or control (n= 1367) arm. Overall, the HR for the development of T 2 DM in the intervention arm during 5. 5 years was 1. 00 (95 % CI 0. 74 to 1. 34). In the subanalysis, the HR was 0. 59 (95 % CI 0. 42 to 0. 83) in the subgroup that received phone calls the most frequently, compared with the control arm. A limitation of the study includes a lack of blinding. Conclusions: High-frequency telephone-delivered lifestyle support could effectively prevent T 2 DM in participants with IFG in a primary healthcare setting, although low-frequency and middle-frequency phone calls did not...|$|R

We tested the hypothesis that type 2 {{diabetes mellitus}}' phenotype in these Italian migrants could differ from that observed in autochthonous Belgian subjects. We retrospectively compared the clinical files of 485 patients with type 2 diabetes either of Belgian (n= 445) or Italian origin (n= 40). Italians were younger at diagnosis (46 +/- 14 vs. 52 +/- 13 years, P 75 %). We further compared this Italian group to 115 Belgians subjects matched for age, sex, and education. Known duration of diabetes (16 years), smoking and drinking habits, <b>use</b> <b>of</b> oral hypoglycaemic, antihypertensive and hypolipaemic drugs, complications, CRP, estimated glomerular filtration rate, micro-albuminuria prevalence, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity/beta-cell function estimated by HOMA modelling, as well as fat mass indirectly estimated by impedancemetry {{were not significantly different}} between the two populations. There was a non significant trend toward higher HbA 1 c (8. 7 +/- 2 vs. 8. 2 +/- 2 %, NS) in Italian subjects whose LDL-cholesterol was however significantly lower (105 +/- 31 vs. 120 +/- 33 mg. dL- 1, P< 0. 01) as well as folic acid (5 +/- 1. 7 vs. 6. 7 +/- 4, P< 0. 001). Insulin dose was higher (0. 77 +/- 0. 4 vs. 0. 48 +/- 0. 3 IU. day- 1, P< 0. 001) and abdominal obesity less prevalent in males (33 vs. 58 %, P< 0. 01) of this group. Thus, Italian diabetic subjects in Belgium exhibit higher insulin requirements despite similar/better BMI, known duration of diabetes, HOMA indices, <b>use</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs,</b> abdominal obesity and slightly higher HbA 1 c. This points towards different dietary habits, as do the differences in folic acid and LDL-cholesterol; different patterns of exercise may also play a role. Higher family record of diabetes may be genetic, but may also be biased by tighter family structure in subjects of Italian extraction...|$|R
40|$|Background: Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) is a {{major public}} health problem in developing countries. Drug utilization study of antidiabetic drugs {{is of paramount importance}} to promote rational drug use in patients with DM and to make available valuable information for the health-care team. Aims & Objective: To determine the prescription pattern of drugs used in the treatment of patients with type 2 DM in outpatient general clinics of Hyderabad. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was carried out by evaluating 600 prescriptions of antidiabetic drugs over a period of 2 month obtained from pharmacy database of five general family clinics. The study assessed prescribing pattern for six classes of antidiabetic drugs: insulin, biguanides, sulfonylureas, glitazones, α-glucosidase inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitors. Results: Of 600 prescriptions evaluated, 349 were of male patients and 251 were of female patients. Frequency of <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> as monotherapy was 74. 5 % and as combination therapy was 24. 5 %. As monotherapy, sulfonylureas (33 %) were the highly prescribed class of antidiabetic drugs followed by biguanides (20 %), insulins (11. 3 %), α-glucosidase inhibitors (4. 8 %), DPP- 4 inhibitors (4 %), and glitazones (1. 1 %). Among individual drugs, metformin (20 %) and glimepiride (16. 6 %) were the maximum prescribed drugs. As combination therapy, metformin + glimepiride (9. 3 %) and metformin + voglibose (3. 8 %) are the most commonly prescribed two-drug combinations, and metformin + voglibose + insulin (1. 1 %...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{situation}} for elderly patients with diabetes living in nursing homes with regard to diabetes treatment, clinical variables, and vascular complications associated with diabetes. A second aim was to evaluate if the patients were at risk of hypoglycaemia. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study including diabetes patients from all 30 nursing homes in Uppsala County, Sweden. Current antidiabetic medications, HbA(1 c) hypoglycaemic events, and diabetes complications were registered from the medical records. The patients were stratified into a general group and divided into three groups according to HbA(1 c) ( 73 mmol/mol). Results: Of 1, 350 individuals, 218 patients were identified with diabetes mellitus. The diabetes duration was 11. 2 +/- 9. 4 years and their serum HbA(1 c) concentration 56. 0 +/- 1. 2 mmol/mol. Hypoglycaemic events were reported in 24 % of the diabetic individuals, and 43. 1 % of them had HbA(1 c) < 52 mmol/mol (mean value 44. 0 +/- 1. 1 mmol/mol). Of these, 36 % were taking antidiabetic drugs. Another 35. 8 % of the patients had HbA(1 c) values between 52 - 73 mmol/mol (mean value 60. 0 +/- 1. 1 mmol/mol), and 82 % of these patients were taking antidiabetic drugs. Almost 80 % of the diabetic patients had either micro- or macrovascular complications, with diabetes duration as an association for both micro- or macrovascular complications and hypoglycaemic events. Conclusions: A reduction of the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> with follow-up of HbA(1 c) level should be considered, especially for multimorbid elderly patients with low HbA(1 c) and hypoglycaemia...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} thought {{that people with}} diabetes mellitus (DM) {{are more likely to}} suffer from osteoarthritis (OA) due to an increased body mass index (BMI), resulting in mechanical destruction of cartilage. However, previous studies have suggested a coexisting metabolic causality. To evaluate the risk of hip or knee replacement, as a proxy for severe OA, in patients with DM. We additionally evaluated the risk of total joint replacement (TJR) with various proxies for increased DM severity. A population-based case-control study was performed, using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Cases (n = 94, 609) were defined as patients > 18 years who had undergone TJR between 2000 and 2012. Controls were matched by age, gender, and general practice. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the risk of total knee (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR) surgery associated with <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> (ADs). We additionally stratified current AD users by proxies for DM severity. Current AD use was significantly associated with a lower risk of TKR (OR = 0. 86 (95 % CI = 0. 78 - 0. 94)) and THR (OR = 0. 90 (95 % CI = 0. 82 - 0. 99)) compared to patients not using ADs. Moreover, risk of TKR and THR was decreased with increasing HbA 1 c. This study does not support the theory that DM patients are more likely to suffer from severe OA as compared to patients without diabetes. Moreover, risk of severe OA necessitating TJR decreases with increasing DM severity. This is possibly due to dissimilarities in methodology, a decrease in eligibility for surgery, or variability of OA phenotypes...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Thiazolidinediones may {{adversely}} affect the skeleton owing to decreased bone formation and accelerated bone loss. METHODS: This study examines {{the association between}} the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> thiazolidinediones or other oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> {{and the risk of}} fracture. This nested case-control analysis uses the UK General Practice Research Database, including case patients with fracture aged 30 to 89 years with an incident fracture diagnosis between January 1994 and December 2005 and control subjects who were matched to case patients on age, sex, calendar time, and general practice attended. We assessed the odds ratios (ORs) of having a fracture associated with the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> rosiglitazone maleate, pioglitazone hydrochloride, other oral antidiabetic agents, or insulin. RESULTS: There were 1020 case patients with an incident low-trauma fracture and 3728 matched controls. After adjustment for age, body mass index, other <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs,</b> comedication, and comorbidities, the ORs for users of 8 or more thiazolidinedione prescriptions (corresponding to approximately 12 - 18 months of therapy) compared with nonuse was 2. 43 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 49 - 3. 95). Rosiglitazone (OR, 2. 38; 95 % CI, 1. 39 - 4. 09) and pioglitazone (OR, 2. 59; 95 % CI, 0. 96 - 7. 01) were used more frequently by case patients with fracture (predominantly hip and wrist fractures) than by controls. The association was independent of patient age and sex and tended to increase with thiazolidinedione dose. No materially altered relative fracture risk was found in association with the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> other oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs.</b> CONCLUSION: This analysis provides further evidence of a possible association between long-term <b>use</b> <b>of</b> thiazolidinediones and fractures, particularly of the hip and wrist, in patients with diabetes mellitus...|$|R
40|$|Aim The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} to what extent patients using prescription antiobesity drugs (orlistat, sibutramine and rimonabant) used cardiovascular and <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs.</b> An additional aim was to investigate whether such co-medication differed according to gender, age and amount <b>of</b> antiobesity drugs <b>used.</b> Method Data were retrieved from the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). All patients who had an antiobesity drug (ATC code A 08 A) dispensed from a Norwegian pharmacy between January 2004 and December 2007 were included in the study. Results During the 4 -year study period 83, 717 patients had antiobesity drugs dispensed. One in three patients using antiobesity drugs had at least on one occasion used a cardiovascular and/or an <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drug</b> concomitantly. A significantly higher percentage <b>of</b> men <b>used</b> antihypertensives (40. 4 vs. 27. 2 %, P <  0. 0005), lipid modifying agents (24. 4 vs. 11. 9 %, P <  0. 0005) and drugs used in diabetes (12. 7 vs. 6. 4 %, P <  0. 0005) concomitantly with antiobesity drugs when compared to women. The percentage of patients who had concomitant drug use increased markedly with age. One in four patients had antiobesity drugs dispensed only once during the period 2004 – 2007. Conclusion <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> cardiovascular and <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> among patients using antiobesity drugs was extensive, especially among men and elderly patients. Overall, there was a high degree of polypharmacy among users of antiobesity drugs. Also, many patients dispensed antiobesity drugs in amounts that indicated use less than the recommended daily dose, and many dispensed antiobesity drugs only once. When prescribing antiobesity drugs to patients the potential benefits of antiobesity drugs should be considered in relation to the patients other chronic diseases and to the total complexity of the patients drug regimen...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundChronic {{renal failure}} (CRF) is {{associated}} with a high incidence of stroke. In particular, the mortality rate for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients with hemodialysis (HD) due to advanced stage CRF is high, and the annual number of such cases is increasing. Therefore, we retrospectively investigated 5 years of clinical data from patients with ICH in our institution to reveal differences in the clinical courses of HD and non-HD patients and to identify risk factors for poor outcomes in ICH patients with HD. MethodsThree hundred sixty-six consecutive patients with nontraumatic spontaneous ICH, 91 % of whom did not receive HD (non-HD group) and 9 % of whom received HD for the treatment of CRF (HD group), were enrolled. Clinical data, including the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), microbleeds, modified Rankin scale scores, previous medical disease history, the presence of HD, and the days on which ICH occurred, were evaluated. ResultsIn a comparison of HD patients and non-HD patients, the HD patients had higher rates of hematomas in the basal ganglia, IVH, <b>use</b> <b>of</b> antihypertensive <b>drugs,</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs,</b> and antiplatelet/anticoagulants. The mortality rate was higher in the HD group (44 %) than in the non-HD group (21 %). In the HD group, the risk factors associated with mortality were hematoma volume, the presence of IVH, and lack <b>of</b> antihypertensive drug <b>use.</b> Eighty-five percent <b>of</b> the ICH occurred on intermittent HD days or before the HD procedure on an HD day. ConclusionsMortality in ICH patients with HD was associated with lack <b>of</b> antihypertensive drug <b>use.</b> Therefore, strict control of blood pressure is needed in HD patients to prevent ICH, especially on intermittent HD days or before the HD procedure...|$|R
40|$|Background: It is {{generally}} thought {{that people with}} diabetes mellitus (DM) {{are more likely to}} suffer from OA due to an increased Body Mass Index (BMI), resulting in the mechanical destruction of cartilage. However, previous studies have shown that DM could also be an independent risk factor for OA, suggesting other causative factors are involved (Nieves-Plaza M, 2013; Schett G, 2013). Objectives: To evaluate the risk of hip or knee replacement, as a proxy for severe osteoarthritis (OA), in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) compared to non-diabetic patients.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundPatients with {{coronary}} heart disease (CHD) without classical cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) are uncommon, and their profile has not been thoroughly studied. In CHD patients, we have assessed the differences in several biomarkers between those with and without CRF. MethodsWe studied 704 patients with CHD, analyzing plasma levels of biomarkers related to inflammation, thrombosis, renal damage, and heart failure: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1), galectin- 3, N-terminal fragment of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), calcidiol (vitamin D metabolite), fibroblast growth factor- 23 (FGF- 23), parathormone, and phosphate. ResultsTwenty patients (2. 8 %) exhibited no CRFs. Clinical variables were well balanced in both groups, with the logical exceptions of no <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs,</b> lower triglyceride and glucose, and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in no-CRF patients. No-CRF patients showed lower hs-CRP (2. 574 ± 3. 120 vs. 4. 554 ± 9. 786 mg/L; p= 0. 018), MCP- 1 (114. 75 ± 36. 29 vs. 143. 56 ± 65. 37 pg/ml; p= 0. 003), and FGF- 23 (79. 28 ± 40. 22 vs. 105. 17 ± 156. 61 RU/ml; p= 0. 024), and higher calcidiol (23. 66 ± 9. 12 vs. 19. 49 ± 8. 18 ng/ml; p= 0. 025) levels. At follow-up, 10. 0 % vs. 11. 0 % patients experienced acute ischemic event, heart failure, or death in the non-CRF and CRF groups, respectively (p= 0. 815, log-rank test). The limited number of non-CRF patients may have influenced this finding. A Cox regression analysis in the whole population showed that high calcidiol, and low MCP- 1 and FGF- 23 plasma levels {{are associated with a}} better prognosis. ConclusionsCHD patients without CRFs show a favorable biomarker profile in terms of inflammation and mineral metabolism. Further studies are needed to investigate whether this difference translates into a better prognosis...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to explore the clinical impact of hyperuricemia on the progression of IgAN. Multicenter retrospective cohort study. 935 IgAN patients who were diagnosed by kidney biopsy at Osaka University Hospital, Osaka General Hospital, and Osaka Rosai Hospital. were included in this study. Uric acid levels at renal biopsy. The outcome of interest was the time from the kidney biopsy to the time when a 50 % increase in the baseline serum creatinine level was observed, which was defined as "progression". The baseline characteristics according to the kidney biopsy at the time of diagnosis were collected from the medical records, and included age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes (<b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs),</b> serum levels of creatinine, urinary protein, smoking status, RAAS blockers and steroid therapy. An elevated serum uric acid level was an independent risk factor for progression in female patients (per 1. 0 mg/dL, multivariate-adjusted incident rate ratio 1. 33 [95 % confidence interval 1. 07, 1. 64], P = 0. 008) but not in male patients (1. 02 [0. 81, 1. 29], P = 0. 855). To control a confounding effect of renal function on an association between serum uric acid level and progression in female patients, age- and serum creatinine-matched and propensity score-matched analyses were performed, and these results also supported the effect by uric acid on kidney disease progression independent of basal kidney function. A cohort analyzed retorospectively. This study revealed that an elevated uric acid level was an independent risk factor for ESKD in female IgAN patients. Therefore, uric acid might be a treatable target in female IgAN patients...|$|E

40|$|Objective To compare {{gender-related}} {{lifestyle changes}} and risk factor management after hospitalisation for a coronary event or revascularisation intervention in Europe. Method The EUROASPIRE III survey {{was carried out}} in 22 European countries in 2006 - 2007. Consecutive patients having had a coronary event or revascularisation before the age of 80 were identified. A total of 8966 patients (25. 3 % women) were interviewed and underwent clinical and biochemical tests at least 6 months after hospital admission. Trends in cardiovascular risk management were assessed {{on the basis of the}} 1994 - 1995, 1999 - 2000 and 2006 - 2007 EUROASPIRE surveys. Results Female survey participants were generally older and had a lower educational level than male participants (p< 0. 0001). The prevalences of obesity (p< 0. 0001), high blood pressure (BP) (p= 0. 001), elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol (p< 0. 0001) and diabetes (p< 0. 0001) were significantly higher in women than in men, whereas current smoking (p< 0. 0001) was significantly more common in men. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> antihypertensive and <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> (but not that of other drugs) was more common in women than in men. However, BP (p< 0. 0001), LDL-cholesterol (p< 0. 0001) and HbA 1 c (p< 0. 0001) targets were less often achieved in women than in men. Between 1994 and 2007, cholesterol control improved less in women than in men (interaction: p= 0. 009), whereas trends in BP control (p= 0. 32) and glycaemia (p= 0. 36) were similar for both genders. Conclusion The EUROASPIRE III results show that despite similarities in medication exposure, women are less likely than men to achieve BP, LDL-cholesterol and HbA 1 c targets after a coronary event.
