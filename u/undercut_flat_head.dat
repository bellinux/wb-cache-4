40|$|This project {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} analysis of 2 stroke engine scavenging in two cases. One with an existing condition (<b>Flat</b> <b>headed</b> pistons) and another with a new design (Dome headed piston). The numerical analysis is done with help of CFD software ANSYS FLUENT 14. 5. Here, the modeling of engine piston with <b>flat</b> <b>headed</b> type and with dome headed types was done in workbench. In ANSYS FLUENT after the geometrical design, for the dynamic motion meshing is used and set up species transport model also. At first the scavenging effect of <b>flat</b> <b>headed</b> piston is analyzed. Later the simulation of piston with dome headed type was also checked. Analyzing the variations from each and selected the best method for scavenging. Finally the scavenging efficiency is calculated for both type arrangements...|$|R
