5|$|London was {{historically}} a centre {{for trade}} and arbitration, which Peter S. Smedresman, {{writing in the}} Journal of Maritime Law and Commerce divides into three categories of transaction. English commodities trading, through bodies such as the Baltic Exchange, specify that any conflicts are to be settled through arbitration in London, even when the goods being traded have {{no relation to the}} <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom.</b> <b>London</b> has also been a centre for arbitration on maritime issues, and insurance. However, it failed to significantly attract more modern forms of trade, such as major communications developments or high-technology projects, {{due to the nature of}} its arbitration law. These contracts normally involve large amounts of money and are administered by the International Chamber of Commerce, which rarely sent arbitration cases to London due to the individual nature of English law on the subject.|$|E
