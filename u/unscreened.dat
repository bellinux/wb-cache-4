The critical points shift to lower energy and broaden following a power-law dependence on doping n up to about n= 3 x 10 high 18 cmhighminus 3. For higher doping levels, however, we observe an unexpected saturaton of the red-shift an broadening. We found surface effects, i. e., surface band bending, to account {{for most of the}} observed doping effects. Cleaved GaAs(110), having flat bands at the surface, shows significantly smaller red-shift following a power-law dependence over the entire doping range. The removal of the free carriers in the surface depletion layer of oxidized GaAs(100) - the <b>unscreening</b> of impurities - enhances the impurity potential influence on the band structures.

40|$|Allogeneic {{lymphocytes}} {{mixed in}} vitro ("mixed cultures") undergo {{a series of}} changes characterized by increased synthesis of RNA, protein, and DNA resulting in morphological transformation (1 - 3), provided that the lymphocytes originate from individuals who are incompatible at the major human histocompatibility locus.

This growth stimulating effect of PHA has been investigated by means of cytophotometric techniques (5 - 7). Fluorescence measurements were carried out on individual fixed leukocytes stained with acridine orange (AO) which binds to the negatively charged phosphate groups in nucleoproteins (8). A few minutes after administration of PHA, a pronounced increase in fluorescence intensity was found, due to an increased AO binding to the deoxyribonucleoprotein (DNP) complex of the stimulated cells.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of a {{boundary}} magnetic impurity coupled with the solvable $t-J$ chains. Our model provides a good start point to understand the Kondo problem in a Luttinger liquid {{as well as in}} a strongly correlated host. The Kondo coupling constant $J$ can take arbitrary values, which allows us to study the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kondo problems simultaneously. It is shown that both the Kondo coupling and the scalar potential effectively reconcile the spin dynamics at low temperatures. Generally, the impurity spin is split into two ghost spins via coupling effect. The residual entropy, which can be exactly derived for the present model, is strongly interaction-dependent. This hints the local spin configuration is very complicated and very different from that in the conventional Kondo problem. An <b>unscreening</b> phenomenon in the antiferromagnetic regime is found, which reveals the impurity potential plays an important role for the Kondo problem in a strongly correlated host.

40|$|Using {{rotating}} analyzer ellipsometry, {{we determined}} {{at room temperature}} and at 30 K the doping dependence of the E 1 and E 1 plus Delta 1 critical points of n-type highly Si-doped GaAs(100) (up to carrier concentration of 1. 9 x 10 high 19 cm high- 3) exposed to air. For both temperatures the E 1 and E 1 plus Delta 1 critical points shift to lower energies with increasing dopant concentration. This redshift, however, unexpectedly saturates at a dopant concentration of about 3 x 10 high 18 cm high- 3. We found these measurements to be strongly influenced by surface effects. UHV-cleaved GaAs(110) samples (n- and p-type), exhibiting flat bands at the surface, show a significantly smaller energy shift over the whole doping range following a power-law dependence corresponding rather well to the predicted effect of screened impurities, i. e., dopants. We believe that this represents the behavior of bulk doping. fermi-level pinning introduced by hydrogen absorption after cleaving produces a behavior simi lar to that observed for air-exposed surfaces. These measurements are influenced by band-bending and carrier depletion in the surface region. Measurements of undoped material in an electric field indicate {{that the presence of}} this field does not account for all the band-bending effects.

40|$|International audienceWe review here some {{universal}} {{aspects of}} the physics of two-electron molecular transistors {{in the absence of}} strong spin-orbit effects. Several recent quantum dot experiments have shown that an electrostatic backgate could be used to control the energy dispersion of magnetic levels. We discuss how the generally asymmetric coupling of the metallic contacts to two different molecular orbitals can indeed lead to a gate-tunable Hund's rule in the presence of singlet and triplet states in the quantum dot. For gate voltages such that the singlet constitutes the (non-magnetic) ground state, one generally observes a suppression of low voltage transport, which can yet be restored in the form of enhanced cotunneling features at finite bias. More interestingly, when the gate voltage is controlled to obtain the triplet configuration, spin S = 1 Kondo anomalies appear at zero bias, with non-Fermi liquid features related to the underscreening of a spin larger than 1 / 2. Finally, the small bare singlet-triplet splitting in our device allows fine-tuning with the gate between these two magnetic configurations, leading to an <b>unscreening</b> quantum phase transition. This transition occurs between the non-magnetic singlet phase, where a two-stage Kondo effect occurs, and the triplet phase, where the partially compensated (underscreened) moment is akin to a magnetically 'ordered' state. These observations are put theoretically into a consistent global picture by using new numerical renormalization group simulations, tailored to capture sharp finite-voltage cotunneling features within the Coulomb diamonds, together with complementary out-of-equilibrium diagrammatic calculations on the two-orbital Anderson model.

6000|$|He did {{not expect}} Dinah {{to be at home}} at this hour, but he got down from his horse and tied it at the little gate, that he might ask where she was gone to-day. He had set his mind on {{following}} her and bringing her home. She was gone to Sloman's End, a hamlet about three miles off, over the hill, the old woman told him--had set off directly after morning chapel, to preach in a cottage there, as her habit was. Anybody at the town would tell him the way to Sloman's End. So Adam got on his horse again and rode to the town, putting up at the old inn and taking a hasty dinner there in the company of the too chatty landlord, from whose friendly questions and reminiscences he was glad to escape as soon as possible and set out towards Sloman's End. With all his haste it was nearly four o'clock before he could set off, and he thought that as Dinah had gone so early, she would perhaps already be near returning. The little, grey, desolate-looking hamlet, <b>unscreened</b> by sheltering trees, lay in sight long before he reached it, and as he came near he could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn. [...] "Perhaps that's the last hymn before they come away," [...] Adam thought. [...] "I'll walk back a bit and turn again to meet her, farther off the village." [...] He walked back till he got nearly {{to the top of the}} hill again, and seated himself on a loose stone, against the low wall, to watch till he should see the little black figure leaving the hamlet and winding up the hill. He chose this spot, almost at the top of the hill, because it was away from all eyes--no house, no cattle, not even a nibbling sheep near--no presence but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky.|$|E
6000|$|Not {{the first}} time she had used that curious expression! Yet her life was far from dull, so far as he could see; with the new {{interests}} created by the war, and the constant calls on her time made by the perfection of their home life, she had a useful and busy existence. Again the random thought passed through him: 'But she never tells me anything!' And suddenly that lugubrious khaki-clad figure started up among the rose bushes. [...] "We've got a lot to be thankful for!" [...] he said abruptly. [...] "I must go to work!" [...] His wife, raising one eyebrow, smiled. [...] "And I to weep!" [...] Mr. Bosengate laughed--she had a pretty wit! And stroking his comely moustache where it had been kissed, he moved out into the sunshine. All the evening, throughout his labours, not inconsiderable, for this jury business had put him behind time, he was afflicted by that restless pleasure in his surroundings; would break off in mowing the lower lawn to look at the house through the trees; would leave his study and committee papers, to cross into the drawing-room and sniff its dainty fragrance; paid a special good-night visit to the children having supper in the schoolroom; pottered in and out from his dressing room to admire his wife while she was changing for dinner; dined with his mind perpetually on the next course; talked volubly of the war; and in the billiard room afterwards, smoking the pipe which had taken the place of his cigar, could not keep still, but roamed about, now in conservatory, now in the drawing-room, where his wife and the governess were still making swabs. It seemed to him that he could not have enough of anything. About eleven o'clock he strolled out beautiful night, only just dark enough--under the new arrangement with Time--and went down to the little round fountain below the terrace. His wife was playing the piano. Mr. Bosengate looked at the water and the flat dark water lily leaves which floated there; looked up at the house, where only narrow chinks of light showed, because of the Lighting Order. The dreamy music drifted out; there was a scent of heliotrope. He moved a few steps back, and sat in the children's swing under an old lime tree. Jolly--blissful--in the warm, bloomy dark! Of all hours of the day, this before going to bed was perhaps the pleasantest. He saw the light go up in his wife's bed room, <b>unscreened</b> for a full minute, and thought: 'Aha! If I did my duty as a special, I should [...] "strafe" [...] her for that.' She came to the window, her figure lighted, hands up to the back of her head, so that her bare arms gleamed. Mr. Bosengate wafted her a kiss, knowing he could not be seen. 'Lucky chap!' he mused; 'she's a great joy!' Up went her arm, down came the blind the house was dark again. He drew a long breath. 'Another ten minutes,' he thought, 'then I'll go in and shut up. By Jove! The limes are beginning to smell already!' And, the better to take in that acme of his well-being, he tilted the swing, lifted his feet from the ground, and swung himself toward the scented blossoms. He wanted to whelm his senses in their perfume, and closed his eyes. But instead of the domestic vision he expected, the face of the little Welsh soldier, hare-eyed, shadowy, pinched and dark and pitiful, started up with such disturbing vividness that he opened his eyes again at once. Curse! The fellow almost haunted one! Where would he be now poor little devil!--lying in his cell, thinking--thinking of his wife! Feeling suddenly morbid, Mr. Bosengate arrested the swing and stood up. Absurd!--all his well-being and mood of warm anticipation had deserted him! 'A d---d world!' he thought. 'Such a lot of misery! Why should I have to sit in judgment on that poor beggar, and condemn him?' He moved up on to the terrace and walked briskly, to rid himself of this disturbance before going in. 'That commercial traveller chap,' he thought, 'the rest of those fellows--they see nothing!' And, abruptly turning up the three stone steps, he entered the conservatory, locked it, passed into the billiard room, and drank his barley water. One of the pictures was hanging crooked; he went up to put it straight. Still life. Grapes and apples, and--lobsters! They struck him as odd for {{the first time}}. Why lobsters? The whole picture seemed dead and oily. He turned off the light, and went upstairs, passed his wife's door, into his own room, and undressed. Clothed in his pyjamas he opened the door between the rooms. By the light coming from his own he could see her dark head on the pillow. Was she asleep? No--not asleep, certainly. The moment of fruition had come; the crowning of his pride and pleasure in his home. But he continued to stand there. He had suddenly no pride, no pleasure, no desire; nothing but a sort of dull resentment against everything. He turned back; shut the door, and slipping between the heavy curtains and his open window, stood looking out at the night. 'Full of misery!' he thought. 'Full of d---d misery!' ...|$|E
