5|$|The Dalek {{ability to}} fly or hover {{dates back to}} The Chase, where a Dalek was implied to have taken flight, while in Revelation of the Daleks, a Dalek hovered to exterminate two victims. The {{first part of the}} 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks shows a Dalek who was clearly seen to hover <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> stairs to the Doctor's horror. Rose and Adam allude to a long-held fan joke about the Daleks' {{inability}} to climb stairs, and are horrified when it does so.|$|E

25|$|The {{frontage}}: The Jain temple has a fine frontage of carved stone, carved so profusely in such delicate airy tracery that it {{is difficult}} to believe it is stone. We went <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> steps and came to a courtyard surrounded by what we call Moorish arches, with colonnades having groined roofs, every inch of which was painted elaborately with graceful arabesques, the effect being rich and soft in the extreme.|$|E

25|$|While, as {{with any}} sort of folklore, the details may vary, this {{particular}} tale (Bloody Mary) encouraged young women to walk <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> stairs backwards, holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, {{they were supposed to}} be able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see the skull-face of the Grim Reaper instead; this meant that they were destined to die before they married.|$|E
25|$|Palestinians are {{barred from}} using Al-Shuhada Street, a {{principal}} commercial thoroughfare.″Those who still live on Shuhada Street can’t enter {{their own homes}} from the street. Some use the rooftops {{to go in and}} out, climbing from one roof to another before issuing into adjacent homes or alleys. Some have cut gaping holes in the walls connecting their homes to other (often deserted) houses and thus pass through these buildings until they can exit into a lane outside or <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> stairs to a passageway on top of the old casba market. According to a survey conducted by the human-rights organization B’Tselem in 2007, 42 per cent of the Palestinian population in the city center of Hebron (area H2)—some 1,014 families—have abandoned their homes and moved out, most of them to area H1, now under Palestinian control.″ As a result, about half the Arab shops in H2 have gone out of business since 1994.|$|E
500|$|Good Street was {{significant}} {{in the life of}} Sophiatown. It was described as a [...] "Street of Shebeens". The writer [...] Can Themba's house, called the House of Truth, was on Good Street, as well as Fatty Phyllis Peterson's 39 Steps. To get to the 39 Steps, one had to walk <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> steps, which looked by all accounts very dingy. One was then met by Fatty who sold about every type of drink: whisky, brandy, gin, beer, wine, etc. [...] Sometimes she even supplied cigars. [...] Good Street was also renowned for its Indian, Chinese and Jewish shops, and for being a street of criminals and gangsters.|$|E

500|$|Now, {{remnants}} of the city lie scattered in Begumpur village, as a mute reminder of its ancient glory. The Begumpur Mosque, a vestige of the old city, of overall layout plan of [...] size with the inner courtyard measuring , {{is said to be}} patterned on an Iranian design planned by the Iranian architect Zahir al-Din al-Jayush. A majestic building {{in the heart of the}} city with a pride of place played a pivotal role of serving as a madrasa, an administrative centre with the treasury and a mosque of large proportions serving as a social community hub surrounded by a market area. It has an unusual layout with three arch covered passages with a [...] "three by eight" [...] deep nine bay prayer hall on the west. Construction of this mosque is credited to two sources. One view is that it was built by Khan-i-Jahan Maqbul Tilangani, Prime Minister during Feroz Shah Tughlaq’s rule, who was also builder of six more masjids (two of them in the close vicinity). The other view is that it was built by Tughlaq because of its proximity to Bijay Mandal and could probably be dated to 1351 A.D., the year Tughlaq died here. In support of the second view, it is said that Ibn Batuta, the chronicler of the period (till his departure from Delhi in 1341 A.D.) had not recorded this monument. The Mosque considered an architectural masterpiece (see pictures in gallery) has three gates, one in each of the three covered passages, in North, East (main gate) and South directions. The west wall which has the Mihrab, has Toghluqi style tapering minarets flanking the central high opening covered by a big dome. The entire passageway of the west wall has twenty-five arched openings. The Mihrab wall depicts five projections. The prayer hall has modest decorative carvings but the columns and walls are bland. The eastern gate approach is from the road level <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> steps to negotiate the raised plinth on which this unique mosque has been built with a four Iwan layout. Stone chajjas or eaves can also be seen on all the four arcades. The Northern entry with [...] raised entrance, probably linked the Mosque to the Bijayamandal Palace. [...] The stucco plastering work on the mosque walls have lasted for centuries and even now show some tiles fixed on them at a few locations. The mosque was under occupation during Jahanpanah's existence till the 17th century. In the later period, encroachers had occupied the mosque but were cleared by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in 1921. A shuttered by lane entry from the north has been interpreted as an approach that was used by the womenfolk of the Sultan's family for attending prayers in the mosque.|$|E

2500|$|Davros {{made his}} next {{televised}} {{appearance in the}} serial Remembrance of the Daleks (1988). Apparently, events had taken place off-screen, as he appears {{in the guise of}} the Dalek Emperor, leading his gold and white Imperial Daleks with control over Skaro. Davros had at this point modified the Imperial Daleks, adding cybernetic enhancements to their organic components. A new model [...] "Special Weapons Dalek" [...] was introduced with an enormously powerful cannon and armour capable of deflecting regular Dalek weaponry. Also, for the first time, a Dalek was clearly seen on screen to hover <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> stairs.|$|E

2500|$|From the entrance, {{a flight}} of stairs leads up to King's Hall. King's Hall is a large square room, with an {{ambulatory}} around the outer edges. [...] It is entered from the main central entrance and <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> stairs. [...] The central space has a coffered ceiling and is lit from above by clerestory windows on all four sides. [...] The floor is parquetry, made of jarrah and silver ash woods. Dominating the room is a larger than life bronze statue of King George V, monarch at the time the building was completed, but who, as Duke of York, also represented his father King Edward VII {{at the opening of the}} first Commonwealth Parliament on 9 May 1901 in Melbourne.|$|E
2500|$|The {{technique}} of angiography itself was first developed in 1927 by the Portuguese physician Egas Moniz at the University of Lisbon for cerebral angiography, the viewing of brain vasculature by X-ray radiation {{with the aid}} of a contrast medium introduced by catheter. [...] Cardiac catheterization was first performed when Werner Forssmann, in 1929, created an incision in one of his left antecubital veins and inserted a catheter into his venous system. [...] He then guided the catheter by fluoroscopy into his right atrium. [...] Subsequently, he walked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> stairs to the radiology department and documented the procedure by having a chest roentgenogram performed. [...] Over the next year, catheters were placed in a similar manner into the right ventricle, and measurements of pressure and cardiac output (using the Fick principle) were performed.|$|E
2500|$|For {{many years}} it was assumed that, due to their design and gliding motion, Daleks were unable to climb stairs, {{and that this was}} a simple way of {{escaping}} them. A well-known cartoon from Punch pictured a group of Daleks {{at the foot of a}} flight of stairs with the caption, [...] "Well, this certainly buggers our plan to conquer the Universe". In a scene from the serial Destiny of the Daleks, the Doctor and companions escape from Dalek pursuers by climbing into a ceiling duct. The Fourth Doctor calls down, [...] "If you're supposed to be the superior race of the universe, why don't you try climbing after us?" [...] The Daleks generally make up for their lack of mobility with overwhelming firepower; a joke among Doctor Who fans goes, [...] "Real Daleks don't climb stairs; they level the building." [...] Dalek mobility has improved over the history of the series: in their first appearance, The Daleks, they were capable of movement only on the conductive metal floors of their city; in The Dalek Invasion of Earth a Dalek emerges from the waters of the River Thames, indicating that they not only had become freely mobile, but are amphibious; Planet of the Daleks showed that they could ascend a vertical shaft by means of an external anti-gravity mat placed on the floor; Revelation of the Daleks showed Davros in his life-support chair and one of his Daleks hovering and Remembrance of the Daleks depicted them as capable of hovering <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> stairs. Despite this, journalists covering the series frequently refer to the Daleks' supposed inability to climb stairs; characters escaping <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> stairs in the 2005 episode [...] "Dalek" [...] made the same joke, and were shocked when the Dalek began to hover up the stairs after uttering the phrase [...] "ELEVATE", in a similar manner to their normal phrase [...] "EXTERMINATE". The new series depicts the Daleks as fully capable of flight, even space flight.|$|E

50|$|During 1960, {{with foreign}} {{investment}} drying <b>up</b> and <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> capital {{out of the}} country, Habib Bourguiba sensed {{a decline in the}} popular enthusiasm for his régime that had accompanied independence. The president now declared himself in favour of a planned economy and then of socialism.

2500|$|The villa {{is found}} {{just outside the}} {{outskirts}} and suburb of Valletta in the hamlet of Guardamangia hill set just at the crest in a quite residential area in a narrow street. The villa is described as built {{in the form of}} a palace complemented with sea views over Marsamxett Harbour. The Queen describes it as a [...] "town house". It is a typical traditional Maltese residence. The building is built with limestone, known as sandstone and described by the Queen as [...] "yellow stone", and designed with spacious interiors. The house has two entrances with one set at street level and another set after going <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> stairs under an elaborate front porch. The royal family had taken their own personal belongings from Britain when they lived at the villa allowing them to live in a lavish residence, in a once-elegant home. The royal family had British servants at the villa to serve them for their daily requirements.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the later}} 16th century, the castle was {{extended}} eastward {{to create a}} bastion or [...] "hornwork", providing a more securely defended entrance. The hornwork comprises a pair of walls enclosing a triangular courtyard, linking the east wall of the castle with an irregular hexagonal (or heptagonal) structure. This structure, [...] across, contains a well at its lowest level, [...] across and [...] deep. [...] This led MacGibbon and Ross to describe the structure as a water tower or cistern. However, {{the presence of a}} door on its eastern side is shown in 19th century photographs, indicating that it was built as the main entrance to the castle. The water-filled interior would have been crossed by a removable bridge, presenting an obstacle to attackers. From the bridge, access to the castle would have been <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> steps, into the triangular courtyard, and through the gate in the east curtain wall. It is possible that the hexagonal bastion was roofed to serve as an artillery position. Dredging of the reservoir in 1893 recovered two brass guns, referred to as [...] "double hagbuts", and measuring around [...] long with a bore of around [...] Also recovered was a yett, an iron gate, probably installed in the east door to the bastion, but now on display inside the castle. At some point in the 17th century, this elaborate access was abandoned and a more convenient entrance opened in the south wall of the hornwork. By 1714, Lewis Petit's drawing clearly shows that the castle was largely derelict, with only the house at the south-east corner being roofed. Four years later, it was completely demolished, and, by 1912, very little of the castle was still standing.|$|E

5000|$|At Petra, {{there is}} a series of tombs called the [...] "Royal Tombs." [...] These tombs are split into four sections: the Urn Tomb, the Silk Tomb, the Corinthian Tomb, and the Palace Tomb.
