5|$|After {{filming of}} The Wolf of Wall Street {{concluded}} in January 2013, Scorsese refused {{to follow it}} <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> film other than Silence. On April 19, 2013, {{it was announced that}} Scorsese would begin production on Silence in 2014, after a reputed 23-year wait. Irwin Winkler was announced as a producer the same day, as were Randall Emmett and George Furla, who would finance the production through their company Emmett/Furla Films. Paul Breuls' Corsan Films was also reportedly funding the project. Additionally, it was announced that the film would be shot in Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|As {{he began}} to read up on the written {{accounts}} of cultural cannibalism, {{he was struck by}} inconsistencies and other problems in these tales. In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who had witnessed the practice of cultural cannibalism first-hand, he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, but again failed to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> first-hand documented cases. Prior to its publication, rumors had circulated in the anthropological community that Arens was putting together a book that would challenge the concept of cultural cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Karthik {{continued}} to play for Tamil Nadu in the Ranji Trophy, but only scored 30 in his first four innings of the season. This dropped him down the pecking order as Patel was favoured as the reserve wicket-keeper on the 2006 tour to Pakistan. Immediately after the announcement, Karthik scored 134 against Mumbai in a losing effort, {{but was unable to}} back <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> scores beyond 50 in his five remaining innings in the competition.|$|E

5|$|The {{pre-production}} {{phase of}} the filmmaking for Silence went through a cycle of over two decades of set-backs and reassessments. After filming of The Wolf of Wall Street concluded in January 2013, Scorsese refused to follow it <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> film other than Silence. On April 19, 2013, Scorsese indicated that he would begin production on Silence in 2014. Irwin Winkler was then announced as a producer, as were Randall Emmett and George Furla, who would provide financing through their company Emmett/Furla Films. Soon thereafter, planning was made for the film to be shot in Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Voss Line was {{completed}} Norway had plunged into recession. Parliament {{was not willing to}} give more money to railways, and the country had to make do with a transport plan launched in 1886 that did not follow <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> funding. On 1 March 1894 parliament after five days of debate chose, with 60 against 53 votes, to build the Bergen Line. Several different routes had been proposed, including over Krøderen, or down Numedal (which later would get the Numedal Line). In the end Hallingdal was chosen, connecting to Hønefoss and via Sandvika. To save costs a preliminary line would connect Hønefoss to Roa with the branch Roa–Hønefoss Line. The final stage would be along the Gjøvik Line to Oslo. The line would also connect to the system via the Randsfjorden Line at Hønefoss.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and into the summer, Stanley began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about a course of action. Byrd was {{concerned}} that one or more local school districts might integrate, creating a domino effect {{that would lead to}} integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged Stanley to call a special session of the legislature on May 31, but House Speaker Moore demanded to know what proposals Almond felt the legislature should pass before any special session was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it {{had not been able to}} improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call a special session of the legislature. The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call the legislature into special session in late August.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{loses his}} job at the Pawtucket Brewery because Superstore USA has its own brewery and they cannot compete. Back at the house, Brain, chris, and peter watches tv and saids that quahog is {{suffering}} a heat wave across the city, with superstore USA takeing away the nighborhood power to allow temperatures to <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> cooling. Disjointed, Peter joins an angry protest outside the store, but after entering the store to encourage customers to leave, Peter is impressed by its central cooling system, and decides to become an employee also working under Mr. Penisburg with Meg as his superior. Later, his daughter is promoted to assistant manager by Mr. Penisburg, who immediately instructs her to fire Peter. Despite her reservations about her father, she chooses her family over her job and quits. In the meantime, Brian and Stewie decide to eliminate the superstore completely by retrieving Peter's tank, and driving it through the superstore, while Peter and Meg escape through an emergency exit. After bulldozing the store, Brian and Stewie drive outside and demolish it and Penisburg with the tank's cannon. Immediately afterwards, the electricity supply to Quahog is restored, and life returns to normal.|$|E
5|$|From 15 to 20 November, Sydney {{and three}} other cruisers transported 4,000 Allied {{soldiers}} and their equipment from Alexandria to the Piraeus as reinforcements for the Greek military. On returning to Alexandria, Sydney deployed {{with the majority of}} the Mediterranean fleet to cover multiple convoys across the sea: the Australian cruiser spent the remainder of the month operating throughout the eastern and central Mediterranean, and was bombed by Italian aircraft on 24 November at Souda Bay, but escaped damage. Sydney started December in the Aegean, where she escorted convoys and shelled the port of Valona, then proceeded to Malta for a refit and repairs to her rudder, which lasted {{until the end of the}} year. During this refit, the cruiser was fitted with degaussing equipment. The ship rejoined the fleet on 8 January 1941, when she was instructed to head home after proceeding along the north coast of Africa and linking <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> Australia-bound merchant ships she encountered. The recall was attributed to the need to bring Sydney in for a major refit and give her personnel leave, a plan to spread combat experience throughout the RAN by trading the cruiser with her sister ship, , and a need to protect Australia against the German merchant raiders operating in the area, particularly following the attacks on Nauru.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the twelfth}} century the counts of Holland made claims on {{a large part of}} the Frisian territories. It is hard to {{ascertain}} what they based those claims on, and although several historians have delved into the matter, they have not as yet come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> conclusive answers. The case is complicated, because contemporary writers hardly paid much attention to such a side-issue, while later sources are filled with anti-Frisian propaganda.|$|E

She lost the championship back to Guerrero at Judgment Day in a match where his arm was tied behind his back.

However, he did earn {{the attention of the}} Fédération Sénégalaise de Football who govern the Senegal national team. The federation wanted the player to play for the nation of his ancestors and Cissokho initially accepted, but lost confidence in the federation when they lost his passport and informed him that they only preferred homegrown players. After excelling in Portugal, the Senegalese Federation contacted him again, but Cissokho refused contact stating he had not made up his mind. On 3 October 2009, Cissokho announced that he would be open to representing the France national team, but his main focus was currently with his new club.|$|R

25|$|In 1923, {{parliament}} {{voted to}} expend {{the line to}} Ålesund, but did not follow <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> grants. The decision was annulled in 1935, but local interests continued to pursue an expansion. However, there was no local consensus for any one line; there was a conflict between the three areas of Sunnmøre, Romsdal and Nordmøre, each who wanted a different branch to their city, and a conflict between building railways and roads. In 1953, the proposals were finally discarded by regional politicians. However, proposals have since regularly been made.|$|E
25|$|It {{was a real}} {{shock for}} Bohr...who, at first, {{could not think of}} a solution.

I will never forget the image of the two antagonists as they left the club: Einstein, with his tall and commanding figure, who walked tranquilly, with a mildly ironic smile, and Bohr who trotted along beside him, full of excitement...The morning after saw the triumph of Bohr.|$|E

Craig Brewster scored the only goal of the game at Tannadice and United were in the quarter finals. United then met Dunfermline again at East End Park as the teams drew 2–2, as the title chase picked <b>up,</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> one of five teams in with a chance of winning the League. Craig Brewster took his tally to 13 for the season with two goals in a 4–0 win over Morton at Tannadice.|$|E

It was alleged that no post-mortem was done on Shastri, but the Indian government in 2009, claimed it did have a report of a medical investigation conducted by Shastri's doctor and some Russian doctors. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) revealed that there was no record of any destruction or loss of documents in the PMO having a bearing on Shastri's death. The Russian butler attending on Shastri {{at the time of his}} death was arrested for suspected poisoning but released later as per the news source. It was maintained that Shastri had died of cardiac arrest but his family insisted he was poisoned.|$|E

500|$|Director Yoshio Sakamoto began {{planning}} concepts for Super Metroid {{in early}} 1990, but his studio {{was committed to}} making another game, so developers from Intelligent Systems were brought in to help complete the game. After Super Metroids release, {{there would not be}} another sequel for eight years. A Nintendo 64 title was considered during the period, but Nintendo [...] "couldn't come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> concrete ideas". In 1999, Retro Studios, a newly formed second-party developer based in Austin, Texas, was given the project for Metroid Prime. Nintendo rarely allows overseas teams to work on its games but this was one occasion when they allowed a high profile title to be developed by a studio outside Japan. After it became a top seller on the GameCube, a trilogy was authorized.|$|E
