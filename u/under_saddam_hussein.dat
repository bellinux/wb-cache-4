5|$|Assuming {{command of}} United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was {{called on to}} respond to the Invasion of Kuwait in 1990 by the forces of Iraq <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated the Iraqi Army and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E
5|$|In late 1990 after Iraqi forces <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> invaded and {{occupied}} Kuwait, ultimately {{leading to the}} Gulf War, American commentators and Middle East experts {{expressed concern about the}} possible consequences of the Arab street in the region rising up in support of Saddam against their own governments, many of whom (particularly Egypt) had joined the military coalition led by the United States. This did not happen when the actual war began, nor for the hundred days of combat before Iraqi forces retreated and surrendered. A year later, in 1992, David Pollock of the United States Information Agency (USIA) wrote a lengthy paper arguing that those commentators had seriously misunderstood the Arab street and, by extension, all Arab public opinion.|$|E
25|$|Between 16–17 March 1988, the Iraqi {{government}} <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> {{carried out}} a poison gas attack in the Kurdish town of Halabja in Iraqi Kurdistan.

The Baath party <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> engaged in active expulsion of minorities from the mid-1970s onwards. In 1978 and 1979, 600 Kurdish villages were burned down and around 200,000 Kurds were deported to {{the other parts of}} the country.|$|E
25|$|Al-Douri was {{a senior}} member of the Ba'athist {{government}} <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> This was due to the fact that both al-Douri and Hussein came from the same Tikriti tribal background. When the Ba'athists seized power in 1968, he was made interior minister where he oversaw efforts to sideline political rivals to the Ba'ath Party, mainly the Iraqi Communist Party. Al-Douri became the vice chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council prior to 2003, giving him unprecedented amounts of power and influence within the Iraqi political sphere.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the devastation}} of the campaigns of the Iraqi army <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> and other former Iraqi regimes, the Kurdistan Region's {{infrastructure}} {{was never able to}} modernize. After the 1991 safe haven was established, the Kurdistan Regional Government began projects to reconstruct the Kurdistan Region. Since then, of all the 4,500 villages that were destroyed by Saddam Husseins' regime, 65% have been reconstructed by the KRG. Furthermore, since the removal of the previous regime in 2003, the KRG has been able to scale up its service delivery and infrastructure, which has changed the economic landscape of the region and facilitated a number of investment projects.|$|E
25|$|The Shia {{suffered}} indirect {{and direct}} persecution under post-colonial Iraqi governments since 1932, erupting into full-scale rebellions in 1935 and 1936. Shias were also persecuted during the Ba'ath Party rule, especially <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> It {{is said that}} every Shia clerical family of note in Iraq had tales of torture and murder to recount. In 1969 the son of Iraq's highest Shia Ayatollah Muhsin al-Hakim was arrested and allegedly tortured. From 1979–1983 Saddam's regime executed 48 major Shia clerics in Iraq. They included Shia leader Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr and his sister. Tens of thousands of Iranians and Arabs of Iranian origin were expelled in 1979 and 1980 and a further 75,000 in 1989.|$|E
50|$|Iraq's era <b>under</b> President <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> was {{notorious for}} its severe {{violations}} of human rights. Secret police, torture, mass murder, rape, deportations, forced disappearances, assassinations, chemical warfare, {{and the destruction of}} southern Iraq's marshes were some of the methods the country's Ba'athist government used to maintain control. The total number of deaths related to torture and murder during this period are unknown. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International issued regular reports of widespread imprisonment and torture.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Under</b> President <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> the {{ministry}} performed {{a wide range}} of functions, including keeping Iraq free of Hussein's enemies and others deemed [...] "undesirable." [...] When the United States and coalition forces found and captured Hussein in the Iraq War, {{the ministry}} was not dissolved, unlike the defense ministry and intelligence agencies. Combined Joint Task Force 7 planned to hand over policing and internal security duties as soon as possible. Instead, the ministry was merely restructured.|$|R

25|$|On 17 September 1980, {{after the}} Islamic Revolution in Iran settled down, Iraq <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> {{declared}} the previous settlement of border disputes with Iran null and void. Several days later on 22 September, Iraq invaded Iran in the Iran–Iraq War. Lasting until 1988, the brutal war killed {{over one million}} people and critically soured Arab–Iranian relations. The Iranian government officially viewed the conflict not as Arab vs. Iranian but from a religious perspective of Shia versus Sunni, although many in Iran did view the conflict as an Arab versus Iran issue. In Iraq, the conflict was continually presented in a historical context as Arab versus Persian. The impact {{of the war was}} devastating to relations in the region; general Arab support for Iraq and a fear of Shia Muslims led to many disputes between Iran and the other Persian Gulf states. The war was a primary cause for the rise of anti-Arabism within Iran, which had until then been largely insignificant. The war ended with a UN-sponsored cease-fire.|$|E
500|$|Gravel {{opposes the}} use of {{international}} sanctions as a policy tool and blamed the ones against Iraq <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> {{for the deaths of}} a half-million children in that country. In 2013, Gravel said that sanctions against Iran were [...] "illegal".|$|E

50|$|Because of this {{connection}} to the Sufi Iblis tradition, some followers of Christianity and Islam equate the Peacock Angel with their own unredeemed evil spirit Satan, which has incited centuries of persecution of the Yazidis as ‘devil worshippers’. Persecution of Yazidis has continued in their home communities within the borders of modern Iraq, <b>under</b> both <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> and fundamentalist Sunni Muslim revolutionaries. In August 2014 the Yazidis were targeted by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, in its campaign to ‘purify’ Iraq and neighboring countries of non-Islamic influences.|$|R

25|$|Since 1982, the Iran-Iraq war gave Kurdish {{organizations}} in Northern Iraq {{a free hand}} because Iraq needed and moved its troops to the front in the South. The organization used this to develop cross border attacks from Iraq. The relations between the Marxist PKK and Barzani’s conservative KDP were never cordial, but the latter nevertheless allowed organization to operate from the KDP controlled areas and {{in the south of}} the Iraqi-Turkish border. This gave the PKK two routes of penetration into Turkey, directly from Syria and over Iraq From 1986 -1987, Turkey engaged with Hot pursuit towards the organization members through cross border into northern Iraq. The cross border incidents were archived with the approval of the then-Iraqi government <b>under</b> president <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b>|$|R
