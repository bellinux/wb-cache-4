By February 1999, Siemens had given <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> to fix the locomotives, although they had established that the main fault lay in the generators. The issue never reached the courts. On 5 May 1999, the companies announcement that they had reached an agreement for the trains to be returned to Siemens, and NOK485 million be compensated to NSB. This was in addition to NOK80 million which had already been given as discount. In addition to the purchase price, the compensation included interest and coverage for NSB's extra expenses.

5|$|Although the {{reinforcement}} {{effort to}} Guadalcanal was delayed, the Japanese {{did not give}} <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> to complete the original mission, albeit a day later than originally planned. On the afternoon of 13 November, Tanaka and the 11transports resumed their journey toward Guadalcanal. A Japanese force of cruisers and destroyers from the 8th Fleet (based primarily at Rabaul and originally assigned to cover the unloading of the transports {{on the evening of}} 13 November) was given the mission that Abe's force had failed to carry out—the bombardment of Henderson Field. The battleship Kirishima, after abandoning its rescue effort of Hiei on the morning of 13 November, steamed north between Santa Isabel and Malaita Islands with her accompanying warships to rendezvous with Kondo's Second Fleet, inbound from Truk, to form the new bombardment unit.|$|E
5|$|Leslie takes {{possession}} of the jinniyah and asks for his brother {{to be returned to}} life. Anson is returned, but in a decaying state, complete with injuries from the crash. Leslie's second wish is for Anson to talk, which results in Anson screaming {{at the top of his}} lungs and telling his brother that he is cold. Back at the morgue, Scully finds the body has disappeared and Mulder suspects it is because of Leslie's wish. They go to the Stokes residence and Anson blows the house <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> to light the stove in an attempt to warm up. Mulder questions Jenn, the jinniyah, who says she's 500 years old. According to her, she gained her powers after wishing for great power and long life from another genie. She also says that Mulder unrolled her so he now has three wishes of his own. Mulder wishes for peace on earth and she wipes out the entire human population. With his second wish, Mulder undoes his first wish. Mulder then writes down his third wish to be very specific. However, just before making the final wish, Scully helps Mulder realize that the power of a genie should not be used to force people to be good, and so he ultimately wishes for Jenn to be free.|$|E

25|$|The New Deal tried public works, farm subsidies, {{and other}} devices to reduce unemployment, but Roosevelt never {{completely}} gave <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> to balance the budget. Between 1933 and 1941 the average federal budget deficit was 3% per year. Roosevelt did not fully utilize deficit spending. The effects of federal public works spending were largely offset by Herbert Hoover's large tax increase in 1932, whose full effects {{for the first time}} were felt in 1933, and it was undercut by spending cuts, especially the Economy Act. According to Keynesians like Paul Krugman the New Deal therefore was not as successful in the short run {{as it was in the}} long run.|$|E

An estimated 3,000 Seminole and 800 Black Seminole were forcibly exiled to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi, where they were settled on the Creek reservation. A few hundred survivors retreated into the Everglades. In the end, after the Third Seminole War, the government gave <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> to subjugate the Seminole and left the estimated fewer than 500 survivors in peace.|$|E

When reporters asked for their {{opinions of the}} Dogpatch project, they expressed doubts about the likelihood of its success, citing the failure of other theme parks that had popped <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> to replicate Disneyland's great success. They also felt that such theme parks tend to cause nearby property values to deflate and local businesses to relocate to more desirable areas. Despite these reservations, the Publicity and Parks Commission toured the property and decided to support the project, and the Harrison Chamber of Commerce approved {{the plans for the}} 825 acre (3.3km2) park. In comparison, Disneyland originally called for only eight acres.|$|E

Fifteen officers were injured, and another 20-30 had to be taken to hospital to have their eyes flushed because of the tear gas. After this, the police gave <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> to storm the barricades. The order was given that nobody was to try to enter the area.

The police commanders feared that the squatters would try to expand the barricades to cut several main roads around the house.|$|E

25|$|Nicolae {{was born}} in the Moldavian capital, Iași, as one of Dimitrie's six children: he had two {{brothers}} (Alexandru and Filip, the future architect) and three sisters. He completed his secondary education in that city. By 1877, he was affiliated with Junimea, a conservative literary society founded by Maiorescu, Petre P. Carp, Iacob Negruzzi and other Moldavian men of letters. The club members responded to his quest for affirmation, and provided him with money to study abroad: after attending the University of Paris, he took his Doctor of Law diploma at the University of Liège. It was during his training period that Xenopol met and befriended other young Romanian students, including the future dramatist and theater manager Alexandru Davila. The grant did not meet all of his needs.

Menéndez had ordered them to rejoin him {{at the mouth of the}} St. Johns in the morning, and, if unable to do so, to return to St. Augustine. A storm arose and they were obliged to cast anchor off the coast, the vessels being so small they dared not to take to the sea.
