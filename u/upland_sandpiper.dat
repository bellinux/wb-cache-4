5000|$|Bartramia (bird) is a genus of bird of {{the family}} Scolopacidae, {{including}} the <b>upland</b> <b>sandpiper</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Upland</b> <b>sandpipers</b> forage in fields, {{picking up}} food by sight. They are {{frequently}} sighted on fence posts and even telephone poles. When an [...] "uppy" [...] alights, it holds its wings {{up for a}} few seconds. They are constantly scanning the horizon for intruders. The <b>upland</b> <b>sandpiper's</b> diet includes grasshoppers, crickets, weevils, beetles, moths, ants, flies, bugs, centipedes, millipedes, spiders, snails and earthworms. It also eats some grains and seeds.|$|R
50|$|Some plovers (Eurasian dotterels) and {{sandpipers}} (semipalmated <b>sandpipers,</b> stilt <b>sandpipers,</b> <b>upland</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> greater yellowlegs, willet), avocet, herons (only two toes), all grouse, some domestic breeds of chicken.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Upland</b> <b>sandpipers</b> can be {{identified}} by a distinctive call, sometimes called a [...] "wolf whistle", which features a long, ascending whistle followed by a second rising and/or falling call. These sounds are often made while the bird is landing or while flying high.|$|R
50|$|The <b>upland</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (Bartramia longicauda) {{is an odd}} bird {{which is}} the closest {{relative}} of the curlews. It is distinguished from them by its yellow legs, long tail, and shorter, less curved bill.|$|E
50|$|Bradley {{has also}} been {{identified}} {{as one of the}} last remaining tracts of grassland in Connecticut suitable for a few endangered species of birds, including the <b>upland</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> the horned lark, and the grasshopper sparrow.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the smaller}} species found in coastal habitats, {{particularly}} but not exclusively the calidrids, are often named as [...] "sandpipers", but this term {{does not have a}} strict meaning, since the <b>upland</b> <b>sandpiper</b> is a grassland species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Upland</b> <b>sandpipers</b> can {{sometimes}} be found in small, loose nesting colonies. The breeding season is from early-to-late summer; nests are located {{on the ground in}} dense grass. The female lays 4 eggs. Both parents look after the young and may perform distraction displays to lure predators away from the nest or young birds.|$|R
50|$|In North America, alvars provide {{habitat for}} birds such as bobolinks, eastern meadowlarks, <b>upland</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> eastern towhees, brown thrashers and loggerhead shrikes whose habitat is declining elsewhere. Rare plants include Kalm's lobelia (Lobelia kalmii), Pringle's aster, juniper sedge (Carex juniperorum), lakeside daisy (Hymenoxys acaulis), ram's-head lady's-slipper (Cypripedium arietinum) and dwarf lake iris (Iris lacustris). Also {{associated}} with alvars are rare butterflies and snails.|$|R
25|$|In Mellette County, South Dakota, black-tailed {{prairie dog}} remains {{occurred}} in 91% of 82 black-footed ferret scats. Mouse remains occurred in 26% of scats. Mouse remains could not be identified to species; however, deer mice, northern grasshopper mice, and house mice were captured in snap-trap surveys. Potential prey items included thirteen-lined ground squirrels, plains pocket gophers, mountain cottontails, <b>upland</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> horned larks, and western meadowlarks.|$|R
50|$|Sourland Mountain {{is in the}} Northeastern coastal forests {{ecoregion}} It is {{an environmentally}} sensitive area and is home to several rare and threatened plants and animals, including: trout lilies, wood anemones, ginseng, spotted salamander, pileated woodpecker, bobcat, wood turtle, barred owl, bobolink, Cooper's hawk, grasshopper sparrow, Savannah sparrow, <b>upland</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> and the scarlet tanager.|$|E
50|$|With its open {{coastal water}} and {{abundant}} prey, the refuge plays {{a significant role}} as migration and wintering habitat for the federally protected bald eagle. The bay area also provides prime migration habitat for the peregrine falcon. Many state-protected species use the refuge, including the common loon, pied-billed grebe, osprey, common tern, northern harrier and <b>upland</b> <b>sandpiper.</b> The bay area also serves as New Hampshire's major wintering area for black ducks.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>upland</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (Bartramia longicauda) {{is a large}} sandpiper, {{closely related}} to the curlews. Older names are the upland plover and Bartram's sandpiper. In Louisiana, it is also colloquially known as the papabotte. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Bartramia. The genus name and the old common name Bartram's sandpiper commemorate the American naturalist William Bartram. The species name [...] longicauda is from Latin longus, [...] "long" [...] and caudus, [...] "tail". The name [...] "Bartram's sandpiper" [...] was made popular by Alexander Wilson, who was taught {{ornithology}} and natural history illustration by Bartram.|$|E
2500|$|The park's {{combination}} of lake, woods, and marshes {{at the head}} of the Des Moines River flyway attracts a wide variety of bird life. [...] Waterfowl include ducks, herons, coots, grebes, and white pelicans, and many species breed in the area. [...] Among the woodland birds are flycatchers, sparrows, thrushes, vireos, many species of warbler, and blue-gray gnatcatchers. [...] Marsh birds include lesser yellowlegs, spotted sandpipers, Wilson's snipes, and <b>upland</b> <b>sandpipers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} {{has been}} implicated {{as a major}} cause of population decline in grassland birds. We tested the hypothesis that a combination of area and shape determines the use of grassland patches by breeding birds. We compared both species richness and individual species presence in 45 wet meadow grasslands in the floodplain of the central Platte River, Nebraska. Bird data were collected through the use of belt transects and supplemented by walking and listening outside transects. Our data supported our primary hypothesis that perimeter–area ratio, which reflects both the area and shape of a patch, is the strongest predictor of both individual species presence and overall species richness. The probability of occurrence for all six common species (Grasshopper Sparrows, Bobolinks, <b>Upland</b> <b>Sandpipers,</b> Western Meadowlarks, Dickcissels, and Red-winged Blackbirds) was significantly inversely correlated with perimeter–area ratio. The probability of occurrence of Grasshopper Sparrows, Bobolinks, <b>Upland</b> <b>Sandpipers,</b> and Western Meadowlarks was also correlated with area. We conclude that species richness is maximized when patches are large (3 ̆e 50 ha) and shaped so that they provide abundant interior areas, free from the impacts of edges...|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of the refuge is forested upland, which offer nesting habitat for migratory songbirds. Warblers such as the black-throated green, Canada, bay-breasted, Cape May, and Blackburnian, are common {{in the spring and}} summer. These [...] "neotropical migrants" [...] breed here and winter in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. Refuge grasslands provide habitat for <b>upland</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> bobolinks, and Savannah sparrows. Woodcocks use grassy areas for courtship and upland forested areas for nesting.|$|R
50|$|Despite the barrens name, {{many plants}} and animals call Spread Eagle home. The large grasslands and barrens are {{dominated}} by scattered jack pine, red pine, scrub oak, and quaking aspen trees. The open landscape is maintained by timber harvesting and controlled burns. Some of the birds {{that live in the}} area are: northern harrier, <b>upland</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> northern raven, winter wren, eastern bluebird, warbling vireo, Nashville, chestnut-sided, pine, and mourning warblers, clay-colored sparrow, common nighthawk, eastern towhee, and Brewer's blackbird. Black bears, fishers, badgers, coyotes, red foxes, and white-tailed deer are some of the animals that roam the area. There are two rivers that run through the barrens: the Pine River and the Menominee River.|$|E

50|$|It breeds at {{different}} times on different islands, generally between April and June. Nests are placed on the lagoon shore and consist of {{nothing more than a}} slight hollow in the shoreline coral and shell debris which is lined with grass stems or similar vegetable matter. The clutch is believed to be two eggs, which are white with purple and violet blotches, similar to a smaller version of the <b>upland</b> <b>sandpiper's</b> eggs. One two-egg clutch is in the American Museum of Natural History collection (specimen AMNH 5299).|$|R
50|$|Approximately 250 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} at the Prairie Ridge State Natural Area, of which 16 are state endangered species and eight are state threatened species.

40|$|During {{the past}} 50 years {{increasing}} agricultural practices have transformed native habitats into row~crop fields, making the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grass lands important habitat for wildlife populations. Limited information exists on how nongame grassland bird species relate to different stand ages and cover types of Conservation Reserve Program. Conservation Reserve Program grassland study sites (n = 42) were stratified by stand age (old [10 - 13 years] and new [0 - 3 years] grasslands), and cover types (CPI-cool-season grasslands and CPZ-warm-season grasslands) in eastern South Dakota. Field age rather than cover type was more predictive of grassland bird occurrence and density. Sedge wrens (Cistothorus platensis), common yellowthroats (Geothlypis mchas), savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), and bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) reached their highest occurrence and/or densities in old CRP grasslands while <b>upland</b> <b>sandpipers</b> (Bartramia longicauda), western meadowlarks (Stumella neglecta), and vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) reached their highest densities in new eRP plantings. Grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) and dickcissel (Spiza americana) occurrence and density were more {{closely associated with}} temporal changes in vegetation structure.

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{studies in}} native prairie mixed-grass pastures in south~central North Dakota (U. S. A.) during 1989 - 2003 {{to determine how}} different grazing intensities affected structural characteristics of vegetation, livestock production and the occurrence and density of grassland birds. Generally, as grazing treatment intensity increased from light to extreme, mean vegetation structural values decreased for visual obstruction readings, tallest plants of grasses, forbs, and shrubs, and litter depth. Nineteen species of non-game birds were detected during 2001 and 2002. Overall breeding bird densities were negatively affected by increasing levels of grazing intensity in mixed-grass prairie. Claycolored sparrows (Spizella pallida), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), and savannah sparrows (Passrculus sandwichensis) reached their highest densities in the light and moderate grazing intensity treatments whereas they occurred at very low densities or were absent from extreme grazing intensity treatments. In contrast, densities of chestnut-collared longspurs (Calcarius omatus), horned larks (Eremophila alpestris), <b>upland</b> <b>sandpipers</b> (Bartramia longicauda), marbled godwits (Limosa fedoa), and willets (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus) were highest in the heavy and extreme grazing treatment plots. Livestock average daily weight gains and body condition scores decreased directly with increasing grazing intensity. In contrast, average red meat production gains per unit of pasture had a quadratic relationship to stocking rates, increasing with increased grazing intensity (more animals per unit of pasture) until it reached a peak and then declined. Results from {{this study suggest that}} management of grassland habitats can be manipulated under specific grazing intensities to provide predictable conditions of nesting habitat for grassland bird species of management concern. Collectively, our results support that stocking rates equal to or nearly equal to our light to moderate grazing intensity treatments would provide habitat for most species of non-game birds nesting in mixed-grass prairies and still enable ranchers to obtain a profit from livestock production...|$|R

I genotyped birds and tested for the existence of EPP in 58 family groups of Upland Sandpipers. I found 15 % of chicks and 30 % of broods were the result of extra-pair paternity in this population, which is high in comparison to other socially monogamous shorebirds. Only 2 % of chicks and 2 % of broods were attended by females unrelated to the young. I tested ecological covariates known to influence EPP in other birds including relatedness of mated pairs, morphology of the within-pair male, and nest initiation date, as well as variables which signify genetic benefits, including morphology of {{the offspring}} and offspring heterozygosity, but found no significant relationships. None of the prevailing genetic hypotheses can fully explain the high rates of EPP in this population of Upland Sandpipers. However, the discovery of fine-scale genetic structure in female birds, but not in males, suggests female natal philopatry or male-biased dispersal. This sex-specific genetic structure could be a mechanism of inbreeding avoidance, thereby eliminating the need for females to choose mates based on relatedness. This study provides the first estimates of EPP for the socially monogamous <b>Upland</b> <b>Sandpiper,</b> and provides evidence that the inbreeding avoidance mechanism of engaging in extra-pair copulations {{does not seem to be}} as important in Upland Sandpipers as in other socially monogamous shorebirds.

40|$|Grassland bird {{populations have}} {{declined}} across North America due to habitat loss {{but at a}} disproportionately higher rate in the midwestern United States, where extensive coverage of grasslands and other open land ecosystems have been converted to other land cover types. The <b>upland</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (Bartramia longicauda Bechstein, UPSA) is a migratory, area-sensitive, terrestrial shorebird that breeds in grasslands and other open land ecosystem types across their North American range. Although breeding habitats of the Great Plains contain the greatest concentrations of this species, anthropogenic openings such as hayfields and pastures serve as surrogate habitat elsewhere, as do remnant patches of native open land ecosystems that are less understood as UPSA habitats. The <b>upland</b> <b>sandpiper</b> may therefore represent a flagship species for restoration of native open land ecosystems and a novel conservation opportunity within human-maintained open land cover types. A dearth of information about UPSA habitat selection and use in Michigan (a state of decided importance for UPSA habitat east of the Mississippi River) {{and elsewhere in the}} eastern United States forces a reliance on data from studies conducted {{in other areas of the}} species 2 ̆ 7 range for conservation and management efforts. I used two Michigan Breeding Bird Atlases (1983 to 1988 and 2002 to 2008) to compare areas where (1) breeding UPSA persisted for both Atlas periods (long-term occupied habitat); (2) breeding UPSA were present only in the first Atlas period (short-term occupied habitat); and (3) areas where UPSA was never located during the two sampling periods. Analyses were conducted at the scale of Atlas blocks (4. 8 km 2 blocks defined by the Michigan Breeding Bird Atlas), the largest openings in those Atlas blocks (ranging in size from 17 to 2225 ha), and 39 field sites. At the broadest scale, long-term and short-term occupied UPSA habitat were more commonly located in the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan (NLP), typically on coarse-textured soils; random Atlas blocks in the southern Lower Peninsula (SLP) where UPSA was not present were more often located on fine-textured soils. These soils are typically associated with row crops and other intensively managed agricultural land covers. At the scale of openings within the Atlas blocks, openings containing long-term occupied habitat tended to be located within agricultural areas dominated by forage crops managed at a relatively low intensity (non-tilled) such as hayland and pasture; short-term occupied habitat tended to be in herbaceous open lands; and non-occupied open lands in the SLP were dominated by row crops. Field sampling in occupied patches in northern Michigan confirmed that UPSA use a wide range of open land cover types as breeding habitat, excluding row crops, even when woody plant coverage approached 50...|$|E

Perhaps {{the most important}} use for these reports, {{in addition to their}} incorporation into the Southern Great Plains Region summary in North American Birds, is the noting of significant avian events in Nebraska. Some are of obvious importance, but the meaning of others is obscure, perhaps only to be revealed as subsequent reports show a trend, or events noted in Nebraska are corroborated by the same events noted in the other Southern Great Plains states, in Kansas and Oklahoma, or even on a national level. Such events discussed in this report include a good showing of scoters, hints of a recovery of the Gray Partridge population, a sighting of 7 + migrating Mississippi Kites, a Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker in Sowbelly Canyon, indications of declines in numbers of Black-billed Magpie, American Crow, and Black-capped Chickadee, westerly Carolina Wrens, rather low numbers of thrushes and warblers, westerly Rose-breasted Grosbeaks possibly breeding, good numbers of Purple Finches, no reports of Red Crossbills after 27 Sep, and few Pine Siskins. A similar category of events, but perhaps better labeled 2 ̆ 2 quirky, 2 ̆ 2 were some strange bobwhite items from the Panhandle, the occurrence of Eurasian Collared-Doves in 74 counties so far, the possibility that the Curve-billed Thrasher at the Frimann Ranch in Sioux County was able to sneak its genes into the Brown Thrasher pool, a Blue Grosbeak carrying a minnow, and an Orange Bishop (a bird, not a Dutch prelate) in Kearney.

Other important records were a Tufted Titmouse at Ponca SP, apparently the same bird that was there in May, and the 8 th fall record Rock Wren in the southeast...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of BiologyBrett K. SandercockThe native grasslands of North America {{are highly}} fragmented, and {{remaining}} tracts are intensively managed for grazing. Loss of tallgrass prairie and changing land management practices has caused many grassland birds {{that rely on}} these areas for breeding to decline in population numbers. To investigate resource selection and area use requirements of the <b>upland</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> we outfitted birds with radio transmitters at the experimentally managed Konza Prairie Biological Station in northeast Kansas. Two logistical challenges for wildlife telemetry projects are: minimizing the impact of radios on survival and movement, and optimizing the duration of transmitter attachment. We compared 4 methods of radio attachment for upland sandpipers under field conditions at breeding sites in tallgrass prairie. The daily probabilities of radio retention (DRR) for our 4 attachment methods were: 0. 9992 (SE = 0. 0005, n = 85) for a leg loop harness, 0. 9801 (SE = 0. 0099, n = 11) for radios glued to clipped feathers, 0. 9627 (SE = 0. 0085, n = 25) for radios glued directly to feathers and 0. 8538 (SE = 0. 0322, n = 20) for radios glued to plucked skin. The expected duration of radio attachment ranged from 1290 days for the leg loop harness, and 6 to 50 days for the glue attachment techniques. Survival rates of males (DSR = 0. 9987, SE = 0. 0009, n = 53) and females (DSR = 0. 9988, SE = 0. 0008, n = 71) were similar, and the probability of surviving the 90 -day breeding season was about 0. 90 in both sexes. We recommend attaching radios with glue to clipped feathers for short-term telemetry studies and a leg loop harness if longer retention is desired. The unique landscape of Konza Prairie allowed us to investigate specific tallgrass management strategies, {{and their impact on}} the range and habitat requirements of a bird that relies on the prairie for breeding. We found that upland sandpipers have large home ranges during the breeding season (male: = 199. 0 ha ± 40. 5 SE, n = 21, female: = 247. 7 ha ± 51. 7 SE, n = 23). Male home ranges were twice as large during brood-rearing (= 200. 8 ha ± 69. 1 SE, n = 9) than during the nesting period (= 67. 02 ha ± 11. 84 SE, n = 14, 1 = 5. 14, P = 0. 023). Upland sandpipers selected home range sites that had been burned the same spring (n = 44, ² 3 = 31. 65, P < 0. 001), but did not show preference for certain habitat types within their home range (² 3 = 1. 49, P = 0. 685). During brood rearing upland sandpipers used sites with higher percentages of bare ground, herbaceous and short woody vegetation, and low amounts of vegetative litter. Management strategies for the <b>upland</b> <b>sandpiper</b> should seek to preserve large contiguous tracts of tallgrass prairie that receive a heterogeneous mix of burning and grazing...|$|E
