50|$|<b>Usnic</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{secondary}} metabolite in lichens whose role {{has not been}} completely elucidated. It is believed that <b>usnic</b> <b>acid</b> protects the lichen from adverse effects of sunlight exposure and deters grazing animals with its bitter taste.|$|E
50|$|At normal conditions, <b>usnic</b> <b>acid</b> is a bitter, yellow, solid substance. It {{is known}} to occur in nature in both the d- and l-forms {{as well as a}} racemic mixture. Salts of <b>usnic</b> <b>acid</b> are called usnates (e.g. copper usnate).|$|E
40|$|Two major lichen {{compounds}} (diffractaic and <b>usnic</b> <b>acids),</b> {{isolated from}} Usnea longissima Ach. were tested against 4 th instar larvae and adults of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h under laboratory conditions. Durations and mortalities were recorded at various concentrations (1. 25, 2. 5, 5, and 10 mg. ml- 1). Results showed that secondary metabolites of U. longissima {{had a significant}} insecticidal potential against larvae and adults of L. decemlineata. Mortality rates after 96 h of treatment, with the highest concentration (10 mg. ml- 1) of diffractaic and <b>usnic</b> <b>acids,</b> were 100 and 70 % for adults and 100 and 80 % for larvae, respectively. No mortality was observed in the control treatment. Bioassay tests with diffractaic and <b>usnic</b> <b>acids</b> revealed that the 96 h median lethal concentration (LC 50) values were 1. 783 and 4. 048 mg. ml- 1 for adults and 1. 509 and 2. 759 mg. ml- 1, for larvae of L. decemlineata, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study a fast, new, sensitive, and simple method for the chemotaxonomic {{classification}} of Chilean lichens (Teloschistes chrysophthalmus, Ramalina farinacea, Usnea pusilla, Ramalina chilensis and Stereocaulon ramulosum) using MALDI-TOF-MS and UPLC-ESI(-) -MS data. Lichens soluble proteins fingerprints were acquired by MALDI-TOF-MS and they were analyzed by chemometric (PCA). Lichens organic extracts fingerprints were obtained by UPLC-ESI(-) -MS. MALDI-TOF-MS associated with chemometric {{analysis was used to}} detect new m/z patterns of soluble proteins that were compared with Protein Data Bank of UnitPro. These data also permitted the satisfactory distinction among the families and species. UPLC-ESI(-) -MS fingerprints analyses of the organic extracts showed the presence of five major lichen compounds (atranorin, parietin, teloschistin, ramalinolic and <b>usnic</b> <b>acids).</b> In contrast to other techniques, MALDI-TOF-MS associated with chemometric analysis and UPLC-ESI(-) -MS provided a new, fast and sensitive method for chemotaxonomic characterization of lichens...|$|R
50|$|<b>Usnic</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring dibenzofuran derivative found in several lichen species with the formula C18H16O7. It was first isolated by German scientist W.

40|$|Nine lichen {{extracts}} {{were evaluated}} for tyrosinase inhibition and toxicity against Artemia salina larvae. Extract compositions were investigated by TLC and NMR analysis. The activity of constituents against tyrosinase was evaluated by bioautography, and {{the percent of}} inhibition was calculated based on the dopachrome produced during a set time interval. Cladia aggregata, Cladonia dimorphoclada, Stereocaulon ramulosum and Stereocaulon microcarpum extracts were active for tyrosinase inhibition. Barbatic, <b>usnic,</b> anziaic <b>acids</b> and an unidentified compound present in the extracts, are possibly responsible for tyrosinase inhibition. Cladia aggregata, Cladonia crispatula, Cladonia furcata, Lobaria erosa, Punctelia canaliculata and S. microcarpum proved to be less toxic to A. salina (LC 50 > 500 mg/mL) than Cladonia confusa and S. ramulosum (LC 50 45. 0 and 100. 3 mg/mL, respectively), while the extract of C. dimorphoclada was highly toxic (LC 50 < 10 mg/mL).   DOI: [URL]  </p...|$|R

50|$|Some {{adverse health}} effects {{may be due to}} the acidity of the tea, which can cause acidosis, and brewers have been cautioned to avoid over-fermentation. Other {{adverse health effects}} may be a result of {{bacterial}} or fungal contamination during the brewing process. Some studies have found the hepatotoxin <b>usnic</b> <b>acid</b> in kombucha, although it is not known whether the cases of damage to the liver are due to the <b>usnic</b> <b>acid</b> contamination or to some other toxin. Topical use of the tea has been associated with anthrax infection on the skin in one report, but kombucha contamination may have occurred during storage.|$|E
50|$|From the 1950s the lichen product <b>usnic</b> <b>acid</b> was {{the object}} of most {{antitumour}} research. These studies revealed some in vitro antitumour activity by substances identified in two common lichens Peltigera leucophlebia and Collema flaccidum.|$|E

50|$|Gowardia are shrubby to decumbent hair lichens {{that are}} greyish to blackish in colour. They look similar to Alectoria, but Alectoria {{contains}} <b>usnic</b> <b>acid,</b> which {{gives it a}} yellowish to greenish-yellow hue, while Gowardia lacks this chemical and instead contains melanic pigments which make it greyish to blackish in colour. The pseudocyphellae of Gowardia are always white.|$|E
50|$|Lichens produce {{metabolites}} {{in research}} for their potential therapeutic or diagnostic value. Some metabolites produced by lichens are structurally and functionally similar to broad-spectrum antibiotics while few are associated respectively to antiseptic similarities. <b>Usnic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is the most}} commonly studied metabolite produced by lichens. It is also under research as an bactericidal agent against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species of}} Gowardia could be {{confused}} with several other hair lichens. Bryoria nitidula looks similar but contains fumarprotocetraric acid and has dark-coloured pseudocyphellae.

[...] Alectoria ochroleuca also looks similar, but contains <b>usnic</b> <b>acid</b> and always has some yellow parts to its thallus, while Gowardia does not.|$|E
50|$|Although {{several species}} of lichen {{have been used in}} {{traditional}} medicine {{it was not until the}} early 20th century that modern science became interested in them. The discovery of various substances with antibacterial action in lichen thalli was essential for scientists to become aware of the possible importance of these organisms to medicine From the 1940s there appeared various works by the noted microbiologist Rufus Paul Burkholder who demonstrated antibacterial action of lichens of the genus Usnea against Bacillus subtilis and Sarcina lutea. Studies showed that the substance that inhibited growth of bacteria was <b>usnic</b> <b>acid.</b> Something similar occurred with the substance Ramelina synthesised by the lichen Ramalina reticulata, nevertheless, these substances proved ineffective against Gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas. With these investigations the number of antibacterial substances and possible drug targets known to be produced by lichens increased ergosterol, <b>usnic</b> <b>acid</b> etc.|$|E
50|$|<b>Usnic</b> <b>acid</b> {{possesses}} {{a wide range}} of interesting biological properties. It is a potent antibiotic effective against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Pneumococcus, other bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and some pathogenic fungi. It also exhibits antiviral, antiprotozoal, antimitotic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. Other characteristics, like ultraviolet absorption, preserving properties, antigrowth, antiherbivore and anti-insect properties, have also been demonstrated.|$|E
