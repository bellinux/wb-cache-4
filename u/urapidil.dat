50|$|<b>Urapidil</b> is a sympatholytic {{antihypertensive}} drug. It {{acts as an}} α1-adrenoceptor antagonist and as an 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Although {{an initial}} report suggested that <b>urapidil</b> was also an α2-adrenoceptor agonist, this was not substantiated in later studies that demonstrated it was devoid of agonist actions in the dog saphenous vein and the guinea-pig ileum. Unlike some other α1-adrenoceptor antagonists, <b>urapidil</b> does not elicit reflex tachycardia, {{and this may be}} related to its weak β1-adrenoceptor antagonist activity, as well as its effect on cardiac vagal drive. <b>Urapidil</b> is currently not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but it is available in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|... 5-HT1A {{receptor}} agonists {{are involved}} in neuromodulation. They decrease blood pressure and heart rate via a central mechanism, by inducing peripheral vasodilation, and by stimulating the vagus nerve.

The sympatholytic antihypertensive drug <b>urapidil</b> is an α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist and 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and it has been demonstrated that the latter property contributes to its overall therapeutic effects. Vasodilation of the blood vessels in the skin via central 5-HT1A activation increases heat dissipation from the organism out into the environment, causing a decrease in body temperature.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} with alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, and the antihypertensive and hypotensive effects of <b>urapidil</b> were studied in various animal models. <b>Urapidil</b> reduced the {{mean arterial pressure}} (MAP) of conscious normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rates after oral administration. <b>Urapidil</b> antagonized alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction in pithed rats, elicited by cirazoline and B-HT 920, respectively. <b>Urapidil</b> itself caused pressor responses of limited magnitude at high doses in pithed rats, which were not blocked by yohimbine, prazosin or ketanserin. <b>Urapidil</b> displayed partial beta 1 -adrenoceptor intrinsic activity in pithed rats. <b>Urapidil</b> was more potent in reducing MAP after infusion via the vertebral artery as compared to infusion via the femoral artery of chloralose-anaesthetized cats.

Three intravenous bolus-infusion doses of <b>urapidil</b> (0. 1 mg kg- 1 + 0. 3 mg min- 1; 0. 5 mg kg- 1 + 1. 5 mg min- 1; 2. 5 mg kg- 1 + 7. 5 mg min- 1) were given on separate occasions in 12 animals. Regional blood flows were measured with radioactively labelled tracer microspheres. The effects of <b>urapidil</b> and dipyridamole, a powerful arteriolar vasodilator, on regional myocardial blood flow distribution to normal and collateral-dependent myocardium were compared. <b>Urapidil</b> caused a dose-dependent reduction of arterial blood pressure. There was moderate tachycardia and decreased left atrial filling pressures at the higher doses. <b>Urapidil</b> was a much weaker coronary vasodilator than dipyridamole.

40|$|<b>Urapidil</b> {{is a novel}} {{antihypertensive}} agent, chemically {{related to}} uracil. Its cardiovascular profile was evaluated {{in a variety of}} pharmacological models. <b>Urapidil</b> caused a significant decrease of blood pressure in intact rats, both hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive (WKY), as well as in α-glucochloralose-anaesthetized cats. Reflex tachycardia was not observed. An analysis in pithed rats showed that <b>urapidil</b> is an α-adrenoceptor blocking drug with an obvious selectivity for postsynaptic α 1 - over α 2 -adrenoceptors. The α 1 -adrenoceptor blocking potency proved quantitatively less than that of prazosin. Experiments on isolated aorta preparations and radioligand binding studies confirmed the selectivity of <b>urapidil</b> for α 1 - over α 2 -adrenoceptors. The involvement of <b>urapidil</b> with presynaptic α 2 -adrenoceptors proved negligible. <b>Urapidil</b> proved to possess modest but significant β 1 -adrenoceptor blocking activity, accompanied by a certain degree of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (TSA) {{at the level of the}} cardiac β 1 -adrenoceptors. No significant interaction with vascular β 2 -adrenoceptors was observed. High doses of <b>urapidil</b> caused pressor effects of a probably unspecific nature; neither α-adrenoceptors nor 5 HT-receptors were involved. When injected into the vertebral artery of the cat, <b>urapidil</b> caused a significant central hypotensive effect which was different from that of clonidine and related drugs, since it could not be blocked by yohimbine (α 2 -receptor antagonist). Similarly, the modest sedation produced by <b>urapidil</b> in mice remained uninfluenced by yohimbine. The <b>urapidil</b> molecule does not contain any stereoisomers. Accordingly, one and the same molecule possesses the following pharmacodynamic properties: postsynaptic α 1 -adrenoceptor blockade; weak postsynaptic α 2 -adrenoceptor blockade; modest but selective β 1 -adrenoceptor blockade with ISA; central hypotensive activity not mediated by central α 2 -adrenoceptors...|$|E

40|$|<b>Urapidil,</b> a phenylpiperazine-substituted {{derivative}} of uracil, is a selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist and therefore decreases {{blood pressure and}} peripheral resistance. Apart from its alpha 1 -adrenoceptor-blocking potency, which is somewhat less selective than that of prazosin, <b>urapidil</b> appeared to display substantial central hypotensive activity. Initially, this central mechanism {{was assumed to be}} {{the same as that of}} clonidine, i. e., agonistic activity toward central alpha 2 adrenoceptors. This view, however, appeared to be incorrect for the following reasons: (1) In radioligand binding studies <b>urapidil</b> did not show any affinity for alpha 2 adrenoceptors; and (2) the central hypotensive activity of <b>urapidil,</b> injected into feline vertebral arteries remained unaffected by the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor-blocking agents yohimbine and rauwolscine, which are known to suppress the central hypotensive effect of clonidine. The central hypotensive effect of <b>urapidil</b> so far remains unknown in detail, although a few (but not all) experimental arguments would plead for the 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT 1 A) -agonistic potency of <b>urapidil</b> as an explanation of its central activity. The central hypotensive mechanism of <b>urapidil</b> will be discussed in more detail later in this issue. A presynaptic alpha 2 -agonistic activity can only be demonstrated in certain models but not in the classic pithed rat preparation. It is unlikely to play a relevant role in urapidil's hypotensive activity, and also because of the poor affinity of the drug for alpha 2 adrenoceptors.

40|$|SUMMARY In {{conscious}} instrumented normotensive and two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hyperten-sive dogs, {{we compared}} {{the effects of the}} a-receptor blocking agent, <b>urapidil,</b> on blood pressure, renal vascular resistance, heart rate,'and plasma renin activity with those of prazosin and phentolamine. <b>Urapidil</b> (2 mg/kg) and prazosin (0. 25 mg/kg) decreased blood pressure and renal vascular resistance in both groups of animals, and <b>urapidil</b> caused a small increase in renal blood flow. Heart rate, but not plasma renin activity, was increased {{at the peak of the}} hypotension. Phentolamine had no significant effect on any of these parameters. All three agents markedly inhibited the renal vasoconstrictor responses to intraarterially administered phenylephrine and norepinephrine, and thus exhibited an (*|-receptor blocking action. Only <b>urapidil</b> significantly antagonized the response to B-HT 933, a selective os-receptor agonist, indicating that it also interacts at a 2 -receptor sites. Since both normo-tensive and hypertensive animals exhibited similar hypotensive responses after both <b>urapidil</b> and prazosin, the degree of a-receptor blockade achieved did not reveal greater sympathetic tone in renal hypertension.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{effects of}} a {{decrease}} in left ventricular (LV) afterload (pharmacologically induced by nicardipine and <b>urapidil)</b> on myocardial contraction and relaxation, with emphasis on the effects on load dependence of myocardial function. DESIGN: Prospective, blinded study. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Coronary artery surgery patients. INTERVENTIONS: Alterations of systolic load were effected by leg elevation in control conditions and after administration of either nicardipine or <b>urapidil</b> before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: High-fidelity LV pressure tracings were obtained at end-expiration while hearts were paced at a fixed rate of 90 beats/min. Hemodynamic effects of leg elevation were compared before and after nicardipine, 7 microg/kg (n = 15), and before and after <b>urapidil,</b> 0. 4 mg/kg (n = 15).

40|$|The {{efficacy}} and hemodynamic effects of <b>urapidil,</b> an arteriolar vasodilator, and isosorbide dinitrate, a venodilator, were compared, when used for blood pressure control during abdominal aortic surgery. <b>Urapidil</b> is an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist with serotonin- 1 A receptor-agonist {{activity in the}} central nervous system. Hemodynamic profiles were recorded {{before and after the}} administration of the study drug (+/- 10 minutes before aortic clamping), 3 and 10 minutes following aortic clamping, and before and 3 and 10 minutes following the removal of the aortic clamp. Arterial and mixed venous oxygen contents were compared. Both groups of 18 patients were similar with respect to demographic profiles, anesthetic technique, and perioperative fluid therapy.

The aim was to block the a 1 adrenergic receptors before any acute catecholamine release, to prevent any severe rise in blood pressure. Methods. Eighteen patients with a phaeochromocytoma received a continuous i. v. infusion of <b>urapidil</b> 10 ± 15 mg h± 1 for 3 days before surgery and until the adrenal gland had been removed. Plasma catecholamine concentrations were measured before surgery, after induction of anaesthesia, at the end of pneumoperitoneal insuf¯ation, during gland manipulation, after gland resection, and in the recovery room after extubation. Arterial pressure was recorded concomitantly. Hypertensive events were treated with boluses of nicardipine with or without esmolol. Results. All patients had the adrenal tumour removed without any severe rise in blood pres-sure or other complication. Creation of a pneumoperitoneum and adrenal gland manipulation induced signi®cant catecholamine release associated with hypertension in 6 and 12 patients, respectively. No correlation was found between hypertensive events and plasma catecholamine levels suggesting a 1 receptor block with <b>urapidil</b> is ef®cacious. Conclusions. Perioperative a 1 block using i. v. <b>urapidil</b> is a safe and ef®cient alternative during surgical management of phaeochromocytoma...|$|E

Increased diastolic time {{fraction}} as beneficial adjunct of alpha(1) -adrenergic receptor blockade after percutaneous coronary intervention. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 295 : H 2054 -H 2060, 2008. First published September 12, 2008; doi: 10. 1152 /ajpheart. 91400. 2007. -The {{effect of}} alpha(1) - receptor blockade with <b>urapidil</b> on coronary blood flow and left ventricular function has {{been attributed to}} relief of diffuse coronary vasoconstriction following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We hypothesized that an increase in diastolic time fraction (DTF) contributes to the beneficial action of <b>urapidil.</b> In eleven patients with a 63 % (SD 13) diameter stenosis, ECG, aortic pressure (P-a) and distal intracoronary pressure (P-d), and blood flow velocity were recorded at baseline and throughout adenosine-induced hyperemia. Measurements were obtained before and after PCI and after subsequent alpha(1) -receptor blockade with <b>urapidil</b> (10 mg ic). DTF was determined from the ECG and the P-a waveform. Functional parameters such as coronary flow velocity reserve, fractional flow reserve, and an index of hyperemic microvascular resistance (HMR) were assessed. <b>Urapidil</b> administration after PCI induced an upward shift in the DTF-heart rate relationship, resulting in a 3. 1 % (SD 2. 7) increase in hyperemic DTF at a constant heart rate (P < 0. 005) due to a shorter duration of systole. Hyperemic P-a and P-d decreased, respectively, by 6. 1 % (SD 6. 6; P < 0. 05) and 5. 7 % (SD 5. 8; P < 0. 01) after alpha(1) - blockade. Although epicardially measured functional parameters were on average not altered by alpha(1) -blockade due to concurrent changes in pressure and heart rate, HMR decreased by <b>urapidil</b> in those patients where coronary pressure remained constant. In conclusion, alpha(1) -receptor blockade after PCI produced a modest but significant prolongation of DTF at a given heart rate, thereby providing an adjunctive beneficial mechanism for improving subendocardial perfusion, which critically depends on DT...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{discuss the}} {{expression}} of α-adrenoreceptors in pancreatic cancer cell lines PC- 2 and PC- 3 {{and the effects of}} α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoreceptor antagonists, yohimbine and <b>urapidil</b> hydrochloride, on the cell lines in vitro. METHODS: We cultured the human ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines PC- 2 and PC- 3 and analyzed the mRNA expression of α 1 - and α 2 -adrenergic receptors by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The effects of yohimbine and <b>urapidil</b> hydrochloride on cell proliferation were assessed by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 4,-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis was detected using the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT) -mediated biotin- 16 -dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay and flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: PC- 2 expressed mRNA in α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoreceptors. MTT assays showed that <b>urapidil</b> hydrochloride had no effect on PC- 3 cell lines. However, exposure to <b>urapidil</b> hydrochloride increased DNA synthesis in PC- 2 cell lines as compared to the control group. PC- 2 cell lines were sensitive to both drugs. The proliferation of the 2 cell lines was inhibited by yohimbine. Cell proliferation was inhibited by yohimbine via apoptosis induction. CONCLUSION: The expression of α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoreceptors is different in PC- 2 and PC- 3 cell lines, which might be indicative of their different functions. The α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, can inhibit the proliferation of both cell lines and induce their apoptosis, suggesting that yohimbine can be used as an anticancer drug for apoptosis of PC- 2 and PC- 3 cells...|$|E

40|$|In {{hypertensive}} {{patients as}} well as in normal subjects <b>urapidil</b> has a hypotensive action. This is mainly mediated by a peripheral alpha 1 -adrenoceptor blockade with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance; in addition, during acute animal experiments a centrally mediated hypotensive action was demonstrated, possibly by 5 -hydroxytryptamine 1 A (5 -HT 1 A) -receptor stimulation. Studies in humans showed an increase in cardiac output, which was not always significant; it did result either from an increased heart rate or an increased stroke volume. Acute changes in pulmonary hemodynamics after administration of <b>urapidil</b> were most pronounced in patients with pulmonary hypertension: pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance decreased significantly and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased nonsignificantly. A small reduction in pulmonary artery pressure and capillary wedge pressure were seen in patients with congestive heart failure and in patients in whom acute blood pressure elevation developed after coronary bypass surgery.

40|$|During {{the last}} few years, several {{antihypertensive}} drugs with multiple actions have been introduced. Most of these hybrid drugs are beta-adrenoceptor blockers with an additional vasodilator component, such as labetalol, dilevalol, carvedilol and celiprolol. A second category of antihypertensive drugs with multiple actions consists of agents which interact simultaneously with serotoninergic receptors and alpha-adrenoceptors. <b>Urapidil,</b> ketanserin, and a few experimental compounds related to these drugs are examples {{of this type of}} antihypertensive. They may be characterised pharmacologically as follows: (1) Ketanserin is a selective antagonist of serotonin 2 receptors with an additional much weaker alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonistic activity. Its well documented antihypertensive activity cannot be explained by either serotonin 2 -receptor blockade or alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism alone. An unknown type of interaction between serotonin 2 -receptor and alpha 1 -adrenoceptor blockade appears to be necessary, either in the periphery or in the CNS. (2) <b>Urapidil</b> is a selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist and, as such, a peripheral vasodilator. In addition, it displays central hypotensive activity, probably caused by the stimulation of serotonin 1 A receptors in the CNS. This component is probably additive to the peripheral effect, and is also the background to the lack of reflex tachycardia seen with <b>urapidil.</b> The modes of action of both types of drugs are discussed in connection with the role of serotonin and its receptors in the cardiovascular system, both at the peripheral and the CNS level...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the central hypotensive effects of drugs that possess a high affinity for central 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT(1 A)) binding sites; (+) 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT), N,N-dipropylcaboxamidotryptamine (DP- 5 -CT), erythro- 1 -{ 1 -[2 (1, 4 -benzodioxan- 2 -yl) - 2 -hydroxyethyl]- 4 -piperidyl}- -benzimidazolinone (R 28935) and <b>urapidil</b> proved to possess high affinity and selectivity for central 5 -HT(1 A) binding sites, labeled by [3 H] 8 -OH-DPAT. (+) 8 -OHDPAT (0. 1 - 10 μg/kg) given through the left vertebral artery of choralose-anesthetized cats, lowered blood pressure by a biphasic dose-response curve. When given systemically, 10 - to 100 -fold higher doses of (+) 8 -OH-DPAT were necessary to obtain the same hypotensive effect when compared with central administration. Besides 8 -OH-DPAT, R 28935, DP- 5 -CT and <b>urapidil</b> also lowered blood pressure by a central mechanism in doses that were ineffective when given systemically. The central hypotensive effect of 0. 3 μg/kg (+) 8 -OH-DPAT, 3 μg/kg DP- 5 CT, and 3 μg/kg R 28935 could be blocked by 100 μg/klg (-) pindolol, indicating that central 5 -HT(1 A) receptors are involved. High doses of (+) 8 -OH-DPAT (3 - 10 μg/kg) can also lower blood pressure by activating central α 2 -adrenoceptors. The hypotensive effect of 300 μg/kg <b>urapidil</b> given through the vertebral artery could not be blocked by (-) pindolol.

40|$|Selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists, {{which can}} be used as antihypertensives, cause {{dilation}} of both resistance and capacitance vessels, as a result of alpha 1 -adrenoceptor blockade at postsynaptic sites. Reflex tachycardia is weak or absent, owing to the following mechanisms: (1) The absence of presynaptic alpha 2 -receptor blockade, thus preventing the accelerated release of noradrenaline from the nerve endings; and (2) the blockade of central alpha 1 -adrenoceptors, causing a blunting of the reflex tachycardia via the baroreceptor mechanism. Prazosin and its successor drugs doxazosin, trimazosin and terazosin are the prototypes of selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists. <b>Urapidil,</b> labetalol and ketanserin are well-known examples of hybrid drugs, which possess additional pharmacological activities besides their alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonistic potency. Labetalol is predominantly a (beta 1 + beta 2) -blocker with much weaker alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonistic activity. The compound contains four stereoisomers with different pharmacodynamic properties and as such is not a true hybrid drug. Ketanserin is a selective 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 HT 2) -receptor antagonist, with modest alpha 1 -adrenoceptor activity. <b>Urapidil,</b> a selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist, simultaneously displays central hypotensive activity which, unlike that of clonidine and related drugs, is not mediated by alpha 2 -adrenoceptors. <b>Urapidil</b> is also a weak beta 1 -blocker.

However in these patients, enhanced α-adrenergic microvascular vasoconstriction may preclude adenosine to induce maximal hyperaemia. To assess the presence and the clinical relevance of residual microvascular resistance after administration of adenosine. Fractional flow reserve (FFR, calculated by coronary pressure measurements during adenosine-induced hyperaemia) was assessed in 85 patients with an intermediate coronary stenosis (mean diameter stenosis of 50 ± 1 %) and normal left ventricular function which were divided into the following three groups: (a) 33 patients before and after IC bolus of phentolamine, an α 1 -, α 2 -adrenergic blocker; (b) 32 patients before and after IC bolus of <b>urapidil,</b> a selective α 1 -adrenergic blocker; (c) 20 patients before and after IC bolus of saline. Since minimal luminal diameter remained unchanged before and after phentolamine (1. 46 ± 0. 06 vs. 1. 47 ± 0. 06 mm, ns), <b>urapidil</b> (1. 46 ± 0. 06 vs. 1. 39 ± 0. 08, ns), and saline (1. 56 ± 0. 08 vs. 1. 55 ± 0. 08, ns), changes in FFR reflects changes in microvascular resistance. Overall, phentolamine and <b>urapidil</b> induced a slight but significant decrease in FFR (phentolamine: 0. 79 ± 0. 02 vs. 0. 77 ± 0. 02, p < 0. 05; urapidil: 0. 78 ± 0. 02 vs. 0. 75 ± 0. 02, p < 0. 05). However, only 6 patients showed a change in FFR from ≥ 0. 75 to < 0. 75 and no patients showed a change in FFR from ≥ 0. 80 to < 0. 75 that could have influenced clinical decision making. Saline did not induce any change in FFR. Phentolamine and <b>urapidil</b> induced only transient and negligible haemodynamic changes in heart rate and blood pressure. The administration of α-adrenergic blockers in addition to adenosine unmasks a small, yet clinically irrelevant, degree of residual microvascular tone.
