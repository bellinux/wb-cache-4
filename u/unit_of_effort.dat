40|$|Determining the {{condition}} of a fishery {{is a first step}} in its administration. It is equally as important to learn that a fishery is withstanding a strain as to know that it is being overexploited. If depletion is evident, legislation should be passed to give protection. When the status of a fishery is in question the length of time taken to determine this status is a big factor and the administrator should be advised in the least time possible whether or not protection is necessary. By using the method of determining the return per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> expended as a criterion these needs are met; provided statistics {{over a long period of}} years have been collected to give the return per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort.</b> In California the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries of the Division of Fish and Game has been gathering statistics since 1918 for analyses of its fisheries. By legal requirement the fish buyer records the amount of each species purchased, port of delivery, price, fisherman's name, boat name, boat number, and the date. This record is made out in triplicate in a receipt book issued free of charge by the Division of Fish and Game to all fish buyers. The fisherman's copy is a white receipt, the buyer's yellow, and that of the Division of Fish and Game pink (known as the "pink ticket"). These pink tickets provide the required data for a catch analysis when the catches are the product of one day's fishing. When the catches are the product of more than one day's fishing, the pink tickets are apt to be inadequate because the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> frequently fluctuates. In a fishery where the catches are landed each day, the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> will be one day's fishing, and the amount of fish caught will be the return. As this method of determining increase or decrease of return per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> is a comparison from year to year, it is necessary that the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> remain constant. This means that the gear of the boat as well as the time interval must remain unchanged throughout the period of investigation.

40|$|Despite major criticism, catch {{per unit}} effort (CPUE) is still widely {{used as a}} measure for {{the size of the}} {{exploited}} stock, but its indicative value is affected by selection of a proper <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort.</b> The <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> used in the Indonesian fisheries statistical system is poorly standardised with one trip made by a fishing unit of any type. Therefore, changes in catchability, induced by technical innovations cannot be accounted for in official statistics and thus bias the perception of fisheries authorities on the state of stocks. This study shows that differences in technical characteristics in a coastal liftnet fishery on small pelagics around Ambon, such as unit size and type of lamps used to attract fish, influence both effort allocation and catch per trip. Larger fishing units (more windlasses) are more commercially orientated. They have a larger nonzero catch per trip–– 1. 5 times larger nonzero catch per added windlass––and ignore potentially small catches, as shows from their higher proportion of zero-catches. The shift from kerosene to electric lamps does not lead to a higher catch per trip, but the use of electric lamps is less laborious, inviting fishermen to fish also under more unfavourable light conditions such as during full moon. Model simulations of average catch per trip of two fishing areas show that technical innovations in the last 20 years have increased the mean catch per trip by a factor of 4. 1 in the fishing area with the largest technical improvements. Technical improvements explain 80 f the change in catch per trip in the official statistics over the last 15 years. Furthermore, the variance in catch per trip among individual fishing units has increased and so has the uncertainty in the average CPUE, as only part of the fishermen implemented technical improvements. Both developments stress the poor indicator value of catch per trip for developments in fish stock biomass and the importance to standardise the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort.</b> The characteristic high variability in catch in this fishery will always obscure effects of technical improvements in more local situations and smaller timeframes. Because of the inconsistent effects of the type of lamps used on the catch rate, it is questionable whether standardising the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> by the type of lamp used will enlarge the precision in the CPUE. Nevertheless, standardising the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> {{by the size of the}} unit will enlarge the precision in, and the indicator value of the CPUE in more aggregated catch data as used on higher levels in the fisheries administration of Indonesia...|$|E
