5000|$|... A harsh {{exchange}} of words between officials in Moscow and Bucharest {{erupted in the}} context of Ukrainian crisis. Dmitry Rogozin, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Government and one of the senior Russian officials sanctioned by the European Union and United States, stated on a social networking website that [...] "upon the U.S. request, Romania has closed its airspace for my plane.

25|$|An {{important}} aspect of the preparation of soul food was the reuse of cooking lard.

50|$|The {{game has}} one town that {{functions}} as a hub with shops {{and a place to}} rest.

5000|$|Show [...] "Toch-v-toch" [...] is {{characterized}} {{by the fact that the}} producers decided to keep the intrigue and did not disclose the names of the participants of the show.

6000|$|The other did not {{immediately}} reply {{so much as a}} single word, but sat as still as any stone.

50|$|On the 135th lap, Rahal (1st) and Cogan (2nd) pitted under caution.

Rahal had to pit once <b>again</b> the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> around to correct the oversight.

50|$|The {{transformation}} can {{be reversed}} temporarily by spilling the mule's blood with the prick of a needle or by tying {{her to a}} cross.

"If it wasn't that we {{had been}} {{intimate}} when you stopped at our house," [...] pursued Miss Jellyby, [...] "I should have been ashamed to come here to-day, for I know what a figure I must seem to you two.

6000|$|... "The {{result was}} that they were both killed," [...] Edgar said quietly. [...] "They {{attacked}} us with knives, and we had to use ours.

50|$|Hydraulic dashpots or hydraulic-action timers {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} and operation to pneumatic timers. Hydraulic-action timers work by energizing the solenoid coil which pulls the hollow core {{into the center of}} the coil. Fluid in the hollow core is then forced to go through an orifice at the top, a one way check valve at the bottom of the hollow core prevents the fluid from escaping through the bottom. After the fluid is expelled, the core completes its upward movement and closes an air gap in the core, which in turn increases its electromagnetic field strength. When the coil becomes de-energized, it releases the core, and fluid is forced back into the hollow area of the core through the check valve, so the fluid is used <b>again</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> the coil is energized. Hydraulic action timers are usually designed for a specific time, which is set in the factory during their manufacture. These timers are also very reliable.|$|R

50|$|The exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama {{has visited}} Denmark several times. He first visited in 1973 to help inaugurate the first Karma Kagyu center {{founded by the}} Nydahls.
