Here, we investigate {{the relative importance of}} habitat type and connectivity for butterfly species richness in the city of Malmo, Sweden. Further, we compare species richness and composition in the <b>urban</b> <b>habitats</b> with that in the surrounding agricultural landscape using previously published data. Both butterfly species richness and density increased with decreasing connectivity, measured as the proportion of urban green areas within I km, and were higher in ruderal sites than in traditional and semi-natural parks. Species richness was only slightly lower in the <b>urban</b> <b>habitats</b> than in semi-natural grassland remnants in the agricultural landscape surrounding the city and there was only a small difference in (between site) diversity between urban and semi-natural landscapes. This study highlights the importance of "townscape" composition for species richness in <b>urban</b> <b>habitats</b> but also, demonstrates clearly that <b>urban</b> <b>habitats,</b> especially those characterized by an early-successional stage, can be of relatively high conservation value in regions dominated by intensive human land use.

40|$|Agroforestry {{plantations}} and <b>urban</b> <b>habitats</b> contribute importantly to atmospheric {{volatile compound}} fluxes in densely populated areas. Simulation of emissions from such habitats {{is associated with}} several key challenges, including high spatial heterogeneity due to habitat fragmentation and high diversity of planted tree species. On the other hand, plants in <b>urban</b> <b>habitats</b> and in agroforestry plantations commonly receive more nutrients and water than species in natural communities, resulting in higher production and potentially greater capacity for volatile production per unit of land area. This chapter reviews the strategies for simulation of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) fluxes from <b>urban</b> <b>habitats</b> and agroforestry plantations and provides an outline for parameterization of volatile emission models for densely populated areas with high vegetation fragmentation and large number of gardened, often exotic, tree species. ...|$|R
5000|$|Urban heat islands {{caused by}} cities {{have altered the}} natural {{selection}} process. [...] Selective pressures like temporal variation in food, predation and water are relaxed causing for {{a new set of}} selective forces to roll out. For example, within <b>urban</b> <b>habitats,</b> insects are more abundant than in rural areas. Insects are ectotherms. This means that they depend on the temperature of the environment to control their body temperature, making for the warmer climates of the city perfect for their ability to thrive. A study done in Raleigh North Carolina conducted on Parthenolecanium quercifex (oak scales), showed that this particular species preferred warmer climates and were therefore found in higher abundance in the <b>urban</b> <b>habitats</b> than on oak trees in rural habitats.

5|$|The {{northern}} mockingbird is {{a species that}} is found in both <b>urban</b> and rural <b>habitats.</b> There are now more {{northern mockingbird}}s living in <b>urban</b> <b>habitats</b> than non-urban environments, so they are consequently known as an urban-positive species. Biologists have long questioned how northern mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities, and whether they fall into the typical ecological traps that are common for urban-dwelling birds. A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the <b>urban</b> <b>habitats.</b> Lower food availability and travel costs {{may account for the}} higher mortality rate in rural <b>habitats.</b> <b>Urban</b> birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are more predictable than non-urban ones, as the site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from ecological traps. Mockingbirds are also able to utilize artificial lighting in order to feed nestlings in urban areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas. The adaptation of mockingbirds in <b>urban</b> <b>habitats</b> has led it to become more susceptible to lead poisoning in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. populations.|$|R
500|$|Late {{modern and}} postmodern {{architecture}} {{began to appear}} in the late-1990s and early-2000s. With the economic development, old buildings such as Bok House have been razed to make way for new ones.

[...] Kuala Lumpur's central business district today has shifted around the Kuala Lumpur city centre (KLCC) where many new and tall buildings with modern and postmodern architecture fill the skyline. According to the World Tallest 50 Urban Agglomeration 2010 Projection by the Council on Tall Buildings and <b>Urban</b> <b>Habitat,</b> Kuala Lumpur was ranked 10th among cities to have most buildings above 100 metres with a combined height of 34,035 metres from its 244 high rise buildings.|$|E

On November 17, 2009, however, the Council on Tall Buildings and <b>Urban</b> <b>Habitat</b> (CTBUH), which composes rankings of the tallest skyscrapers in the world based on various criteria, changed its standard for measuring a building's height. Prior to this change, a building's architectural height was calculated from the main entrance {{to the tip of}} the spire; new standards measured from the lowest open-air pedestrian level of a building. As the Trump International Hotel and Tower has a riverwalk entrance and pedestrian level [...] below the building's Wabash Avenue entrance, the skyscraper's official height was recalculated as [...] without a physical addition to the structure. According to the CTBUH, the recalculated height also made the tower the sixth-tallest building in the world, surpassing the Jin Mao Tower by [...] In January 2010, the building moved back to its position as seventh-tallest {{with the opening of the}} [...] Burj Khalifa in Dubai.|$|E
500|$|The building's [...] {{design was}} first {{released}} in December 2001. However, the first design {{did not meet}} with approval from other architects, or from the residents of Chicago. A subsequent revision in July 2002 resulted in an 86-floor design for use as an office and residential structure, similar to the 2006 design which is, however, for a different combination of uses. Smith's 2002 plans put broadcast antennas (multiple communications dishes) {{at the top of}} the building. A revised 90-story, [...] plan was unveiled in September 2003 for a building including condominiums, office space, a [...] "condominium hotel", retail stores, and restaurants. In January 2004, another revision changed floors 17 through 26 from offices into condominiums and hotel rooms. In his May 2004 plan, Smith decided to top the building with an ornamental spire instead of communications dishes. These dishes, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and <b>Urban</b> <b>Habitat,</b> would not have counted toward the building's height. The spire, however, will count, raising the tower's height to [...] At one point in 2005, Trump aspired to build a slightly taller building that would surpass the Sears Tower as the nation's tallest building, but Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley was against the plan. Eventually, Smith settled on a design with a height of , which was the height of 2 World Trade Center, the shorter of the former twin World Trade Center towers.

40|$|Urban centers provide unique {{habitats}} for opportunistic animal species. However, {{conditions in}} <b>urban</b> <b>habitats</b> are inherently stressful and require specialized adaptations in resident animals. Eastern chipmunks are a generalist small rodent species common {{in a number}} of different habitat types. I examined differences in behavioural traits and stress levels (chapter one), as well as body condition and parasitism rates (chapter 2) between urban and natural populations of chipmunks. I tested the hypothesis that 1), chipmunks in <b>urban</b> <b>habitats</b> would show greater levels of boldness and exploratory behaviour, 2), urban chipmunks would show greater levels of stress reflected in greater cortisol concentrations in hair and feces, 3) urban chipmunks would have a relatively poor body condition due to poor quality food and competition in urban centers, and 4) urban chipmunks would show greater parasitism rates measured in greater oocyte prevalence, richness, and abundance from fecal samples. A total of 140 individual chipmunks (80 natural and 60 urban) were sampled from natural habitats in Algonquin Provincial Park and outside of Sudbury, and <b>urban</b> <b>habitats</b> in Huntsville and Sudbury Ontario. Differences in behavioural patterns suggest urban animals may be more habituated to human presence, while body condition was significantly superior in urban animals. However, cortisol measured from hair and feces, leukocyte concentrations measured from blood and parasitism impacts did not differ between individuals from the two habitat type. Overall, chipmunks in these <b>urban</b> <b>habitats</b> have a better body condition and are more habituated to human presence than their natural conspecifics. Master of Science (M.
