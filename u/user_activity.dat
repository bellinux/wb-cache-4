25|$|ReadyBoost (codenamed EMD) is a disk caching {{software}} component developed by Microsoft for Windows Vista and included in later {{versions of the}} Windows operating system. ReadyBoost enables NAND memory mass storage devices, including CompactFlash, SD cards, and USB flash drives, {{to be used as}} a write cache between a hard drive and random access memory in an effort to increase computing performance. ReadyBoost relies on the SuperFetch technology and, like SuperFetch, adjusts its cache based on <b>user</b> <b>activity.</b> Other features, including ReadyDrive, are implemented in a manner similar to ReadyBoost.|$|E
500|$|A public beta was {{released}} July 14. A reduction in memory consumption was made, {{prompted by the}} fact 40 percent of people contacting Symantec support had 512 MB of RAM. The beta uses about 6 MB of memory, compared to 11 MB by the prior version. To reduce scan times, Norton Insight uses data from Norton Community participants to avoid scanning files that are found on a statistically significant number of computers. Citing a NPD Group study finding that 39 percent of consumers switching antiviruses blamed performance, a [...] CPU usage meter will be available within the final product to allow users to find the cause of high CPU usage, whether it be Norton or another program. This version features more frequent updates, a change called Norton Pulse Updates. Rather than deliver an update every eight hours, as the 2008 version does, Pulse Updates are delivered five to fifteen minutes. [...] The Silent Mode automatically suspends alerts and updates when a program enters [...] mode and can be manually enabled. The suite's activities take place while the computer is idle, and terminate once <b>user</b> <b>activity</b> is registered. The final release (16.5) bundles spam filtering, {{which used to be}} a free download from Symantec. This release also bundles Norton Safe Web, which identifies malicious websites, compatible with Internet Explorer and Firefox. Norton Safe Web color codes search results from famous search engine such from Google and Yahoo for safety. The Norton Safe Web toolbar also includes an Ask.com search box. The search box does not share code with the Ask toolbar; instead the box redirects queries to the Ask search engine. Norton Safe Web is compatible with Internet Explorer and Firefox.

2500|$|The {{court held}} that Wolk's claims were {{unlikely}} to succeed on the merits because Photobucket qualified for safe-harbor protections under the DMCA.

Wolk argued that her notices to Photobucket identifying specific instances of infringement also served as notices of present and future infringement, effectively requiring Photobucket to police its site for <b>user</b> <b>activity</b> that infringes Wolk's copyrights.

2500|$|There is also {{a growing}} body of {{critique}} of Web 2.0 from the perspective of political economy. Since, as Tim O'Reilly and John Batelle put it, Web 2.0 is based on the [...] "customers... building your business for you," [...] critics have argued that sites such as Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are exploiting the [...] "free labor" [...] of user-created content. Web 2.0 sites use Terms of Service agreements to claim perpetual licenses to user-generated content, and they use that content to create profiles of users to sell to marketers. This is part of increased surveillance of <b>user</b> <b>activity</b> happening within Web 2.0 sites. Jonathan Zittrain of Harvard's Berkman Center for the Internet and Society argues that such data can be used by governments who want to monitor dissident citizens. The rise of AJAX-driven web sites where much of the content must be rendered on the client has meant that users of older hardware are given worse performance versus a site purely composed of HTML, where the processing takes place on the server. Accessibility for disabled or impaired users may also suffer in a Web 2.0 site.|$|E
