5000|$|The five NWS {{parties have}} made <b>undertakings</b> <b>not</b> {{to use their}} nuclear weapons against a non-NWS party except in {{response}} to a nuclear attack, or a conventional attack in alliance with a Nuclear Weapons State. However, these <b>undertakings</b> have <b>not</b> been incorporated formally into the treaty, and the exact details have varied over time. The U.S. also had nuclear warheads targeted at North Korea, a non-NWS, from 1959 until 1991. The previous United Kingdom Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon, has also explicitly invoked the possibility of the use of the country's nuclear weapons {{in response to a}} non-conventional attack by [...] "rogue states". In January 2006, President Jacques Chirac of France indicated that an incident of state-sponsored terrorism on France could trigger a small-scale nuclear retaliation aimed at destroying the [...] "rogue state's" [...] power centers.|$|R

The manufacturer blamed lack of consumer demand for small cars in key western European markets, and ominously, production was suspended for six days in May 2009 and six more days in June 2009. However, PSA insisted that they would honour existing <b>undertakings</b> <b>not</b> to suspend any of the plant’s 3,000 employees during 2010/11.|$|R

In the nuclear safeguards evaluation, the experts from International Atomic Energy Agency evaluate and aggregate different indicators to make the final decision.

5000|$|Rahl {{points out}} that some joint refusals to deal are {{innocuous}} or even beneficial. The line between exclusive dealing arrangements and boycotts is nebulous. Joint marketing agreements involve <b>undertakings</b> <b>not</b> to deal with alternative marketing channels. Joint venturers may agree to invest all their funds in one business vehicle. [...] "All agreements to deal on specified terms mean refusal to deal on other terms." [...] If there is no requirement as to competitive effect, a rule against boycotts becomes [...] "completely unmanageable." [...] It therefore, Rahl maintains, seems [...] "clear that any comprehensible per se rule for boycotts is also out of the question." ...|$|R

These precepts {{take the form}} of voluntary, personal <b>undertakings,</b> <b>not</b> divine mandate or instruction. The third of the Precepts is [...] "To refrain from committing sexual misconduct". [...] However, [...] "sexual misconduct" [...] (Sanskrit: Kāmesu micchācāra, literally [...] "sense gratifications arising from the 5 senses") is subject to interpretation relative to the social norms of the followers. Buddhism, in its fundamental form, does not define what is right and what is wrong in absolute terms for lay followers. Therefore, the interpretation of what kinds of sexual activity are acceptable for a layman is not a religious matter as far as Buddhism is concerned.|$|R
50|$|Castleman {{realised}} that {{he needed}} {{the support of a}} larger company, and the LSWR was the obvious choice, as it would bring traffic to them at Southampton, and enable them to extend to Exeter. He approached the LSWR with the idea but was rebuffed; evidently they wished to concentrate on reaching Exeter through Salisbury, and they hinted at branches from such a line into Dorset. In the ensuing controversy, Castleman's route became known as the Coastal Route to Exeter, and the route via Salisbury the Central Route. Castleman realised that it was unlikely that both routes would be built, and he pressed the LSWR for <b>undertakings</b> <b>not</b> to develop the Central Route; the larger company again rebuffed him and declined further discussion.|$|R

2500|$|The {{neighbouring}} Arab states pressured Abdullah into {{joining them}} in an [...] "all-Arab military invasion" [...] against the newly created State of Israel, {{that he used to}} restore his prestige in the Arab world, which had grown suspicious of his relatively good relationship with Western and Jewish leaders. Jordan's <b>undertakings</b> <b>not</b> to cross partition lines were not taken at face value. While repeating assurances that Jordan would only take areas allocated to a future Arab State, on the eve of war Tawfik Abu al-Huda told the British that were other Arab armies to advance against Israel, Jordan would follow suit. On 23 May Abdullah told the French consul in Amman that he [...] "was determined to fight Zionism and prevent the establishment of an Israeli state on the border of his kingdom".|$|R
40|$|The Agricultural Statistics of Ireland were, {{as you are}} aware, from my {{last year}} 2 ̆ 7 s address, first {{systematically}} collected in the year 1847, immediately after the famine. They were, like all new <b>undertakings,</b> <b>not</b> as complete as could be desired, and in the year 1848 they were not collected in a complete form, owing to the unsettled state of the country. Allowing, therefore, for disturbing causes during {{the first five years}} of the collection of the Agricultural Statistics, I consider it advisable to commence this review with the figures furnished in the year 1851, thus giving us thirty-eight clear years of agricultural returns, which, I believe, are as accurate as any such large series of figures are likely to be in this or any other county...|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "deed", {{also known}} {{in this context}} as a [...] "specialty", is common to signed written <b>undertakings</b> <b>not</b> {{supported}} by consideration: the seal (even if not a literal wax seal but only a notional one referred to by the execution formula, [...] "signed, sealed and delivered", or even merely [...] "executed as a deed") is deemed to be the consideration necessary to support the obligation. [...] "Poll" [...] is an archaic legal term referring to documents with straight edges; these distinguished a deed binding only one person from one affecting {{more than a single}} person (an [...] "indenture", so named during the time when such agreements would be written out repeatedly on a single sheet, then the copies separated by being irregularly torn or cut, i.e. [...] "indented", so that each party had a document with corresponding tears, to discourage forgery).|$|R
5000|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Railways Act 1921, the Great Western Railway (GWR) amalgamated with six {{companies}} - the [...] "constituent companies" [...] - and absorbed a large number of others - the [...] "subsidiary companies". All of the constituent companies and ten of the subsidiary companies owned locomotives, ranging from the Taff Vale Railway which had 275 locomotives (one of which was not taken into GWR stock), to the Cleobury Mortimer and Ditton Priors Light Railway and the Gwendraeth Valleys Railway, with just two each. The constituent companies were amalgamated on 1 January 1922, some of the subsidiary companies being absorbed on the same date, the rest following at intervals until July 1923. Two more <b>undertakings,</b> <b>not</b> mentioned in the Act, which were responsible for shunting at Swansea Docks, sold their locomotives to the GWR soon afterwards.|$|R
50|$|Smith LJ, for the Court of Appeal {{held that}} the {{provisions}} were not aspirational, they were definite <b>undertakings,</b> but <b>not</b> an undertaking to individual employees.

In 2016 sales of Buckfast Tonic Wine reached record yearly profits of £8.8 million. The abbey trust, which is a shareholder of the Hampshire-based wine's distributor and seller, J Chandler, gets a royalty fee for every bottle sold. Although the trust declined to give out specific sales figures, it said it [...] "strives to work with J Chandler and Co {{to ensure that the}} tonic wine is marketed and distributed responsibly".|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{safeguards}} evaluation (NSE) is {{to verify}} that a State is living up to its international <b>undertakings</b> <b>not</b> to use nuclear programs for nuclear weapons purposes. The main issue in NSE is on the aggregation of expert evaluations for numerous indicators to make a final decision about the State's nuclear activity. Fuzzy multiple attribute decision making (FMADM) methods are capable of dealing with such an issue. In this study, we propose a new FMADM methodology to solve the NSE problem. To this end, we investigate the applicability of four basic FMADM methods, namely a simple additive weighting method, a TOPSIS method, a linguistic method, and a non-compensatory method, to the NSE issue. As {{a result of the}} assessment of the basic methods, we propose a new FMADM methodology based on a new aggregation operator in which a cumulative belief structure is used to represent the expert evaluations. The basic methods and the proposed method as well are applied to an example from the literature for illustration purposes...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{safeguards}} are a set {{of activities}} to verify that a State is living up to its international <b>undertakings</b> <b>not</b> to use nuclear programs for nuclear weapons purposes. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) uses a hierarchical assessment system that is composed of critical activities in the nuclear fuel cycle, processes required for the activities, and the indicators to evaluate the processes. IAEA experts benefit from several sources to evaluate the indicators such as State declarations, on-site inspections, IAEA databases, and open sources. One {{of the most important}} problems in nuclear safeguards evaluation (NSE) is observed in the aggregation of the multiple expert evaluations. In this study, a methodology is proposed to solve this problem where fuzzy linguistic terms are proposed to represent the expert evaluations and cumulative belief degrees (CBDs) are applied to aggregate the evaluations. CBD is introduced based on belief structure, which is developed on the basis of decision theory and Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. The study also presents a numerical example to show the applicability of the proposed methodology...|$|R
40|$|U. S. Navy {{efforts in}} {{implementing}} Department of Defense policy guidance for the effective integration of space capabilities and effects {{consist of a}} variety of multi-pronged and disjointed efforts. Lack of clear direction in analysis and identification of current and future requirements for space-related capabilities presents a hazard to implementation of the tenants of Sea Power 21 and Navy participation in future conflicts. This work proposes an alternative construct for the organization and utilization of Navy space resources against the backdrop of requirements levied by the 2001 U. S. Commission to Assess National Security Space Management and Organizations and resulting Department of Defense Directive 5101. 2, DoD Executive Agent for Space. In order to accomplish its mission, the Navy must establish a clear focus of effort, consolidate and formalize space-related human capital and divest itself of space-specific <b>undertakings</b> <b>not</b> related to core functions. This thesis establishes arguments to propose that the United States Navy relinquish development, acquisition and satellite operations tasks to another service or agency, and invest in appropriately leveraging space assets through the professionalization and promotion of a robust, educated, experienced and capable Navy Space Cadre.
