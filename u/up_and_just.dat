25|$|In 2000s, {{the video}} game {{industry}} is a juggernaut of development; profit still drives technological advancement which is then used by other industry sectors. Technologies such as Smartphones, virtual reality and augmented reality are major drivers for game hardware and gameplay development. Though maturing, {{the video game}} industry was still very volatile, with third-party video game developers quickly cropping <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>just</b> as quickly, going out of business. Nevertheless, many casual games and indie games were developed and become popular and successful, such as Braid and Limbo. Game development for mobile phones (such as iOS and Android devices) and social networking sites emerged. For example, a Facebook game developer, Zynga, has raised in excess of $300 million.|$|E

The following year, he appeared at The Prince's Trust concert at London's Wembley Arena, performing [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Sun". In February 1987 he joined Dylan, John Fogerty and Jesse Ed Davis on stage for a two-hour performance with the blues musician Taj Mahal. Harrison recalled: [...] "Bob rang me up and asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers – and had a few more... Bob says, 'Hey, why don't we all get up and play, and you can sing?' But every time I got near the microphone, Dylan comes <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>just</b> starts singing this rubbish in my ear, trying to throw me." ...|$|E
500|$|Kumar Ketkar, {{the editor}} of the Marathi daily Loksatta, said though Raj might have {{achieved}} what he wanted, but he may have not anticipated the attention it would get. He said, [...] "He thought the media would gobble it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>just</b> create a small storm that will shift the agenda. But the great Amar Singh and Abu Azmi fuelled the issue by taking him more seriously than what he deserves. The confrontational position aided the MNS volunteers to get into the limelight". Ketkar also said the Shiv Sena would lose in the scenario commenting, [...] "The Sena tried to woo the North Indians after it realised their value as a vote bank in the 2004 defeat. They realised that the demography of the city had changed within a decade. That is when they {{decided it was time to}} please the North Indians. Uddhav started organising Uttar Bharatiya functions. This is the year that he bore the fruits of his efforts. That is why Raj decided to strike at the same sentiment that the Sena played in the past—the Marathi Manoos." ...|$|E

500|$|American {{producers}} Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Penelope Magnet, known {{collectively as}} RedZone Entertainment, presented Spears {{with the third}} song they had written and produced, [...] "Pop Culture Whore". While her management liked the track, she rejected it, telling them the song [...] "sucked". After bonding with Spears during a night in New York City to [...] "get in her world", as Magnet explained, {{it was easier to}} [...] "actually write and know what she would and wouldn't say, to know where her real vibe is". Stewart and Magnet began working on the first version of the song; Stewart came up with the track, while Magnet developed the melody on a piano and some of the lyrics. American producer The-Dream became involved after Stewart proposed him to work together on the track for Spears. He explained, [...] "I was just getting into the business. I'm in Atlanta, driving home in a '92 Cadillac, and I get the call [...] I hung <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>just</b> screamed out joyous sounds." [...] During the recording sessions, Stewart recalls that the studio's air-conditioning died for three days, but Spears [...] "didn't complain or anything, and for me that shows she's where she is for a reason." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Piece of Me" [...] was filmed on November 27 and November 28, 2007, at the nightclub and {{restaurant}} Social Hollywood in Los Angeles, California. It {{was directed by}} Wayne Isham, who had previously worked with Spears on the music video of [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman". British national newspaper Daily Mail reported that the video cost $500,000, her most expensive music video since the music video for [...] "Toxic". In some scenes of the music video, Spears wore a purple satin dress from American designer Marina Toybina. Spears reportedly arrived twelve hours late to the set, after spending the day with her sons Sean Preston and Jayden James. Isham talked about the situation, saying, [...] "She was late. People made a big thing about it, [...] how could she not be late, when you have 50, 65, 75 people running down the street chasing her car? That was a long day for the crew. It was literally a 20-hour day for the crew. She {{was there for the}} last six hours of it. She got there late, showed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>just</b> kicked ass". He also explained the concept of the music video: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Clown"'s concept {{deals with}} an {{incident}} that happened in San Diego, California. A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>just</b> snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E

[...] "One night I couldn't sleep and I was <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>just</b> Googling random stuff and I'm like, 'Hmmm, PETA.' I saw all the videos and I {{just thought it was}} horrible.

2500|$|In the Jets' postgame press conference, Sanchez explained: [...] "I was {{thinking}} a different play in my head. That was a mental error there.

[...] "I was just trying to get down. The play was over. Say 'Uncle'. Do the right thing. Get to second-and-10 and live to play another down. I'm not a big believer in luck, but that was pretty unlucky. It was really too bad." [...] In an interview six days later, Sanchez described the play again: [...] "It's embarrassing. You screw up the play and I'm trying to do the right thing. It's not like I'm trying to force something. I start to slide and I slide in the worst spot I possibly could—right into Brandon Moore. I guess (I was) more stunned than anything. Just like a car accident. I was like, 'Whoa. What just happened?' Then, the ball's gone. It was weird." ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally, the Hulk {{was shown}} as simple minded and quick to anger. [...] The Hulk {{generally}} divorces his identity from Banner’s, decrying Banner as [...] "puny Banner." [...] From his earliest stories, the Hulk has {{been concerned with}} finding sanctuary and quiet and often is shown reacting emotionally to situations quickly. Grest and Weinberg call Hulk the [...] "dark, primordial side of Banner's psyche." [...] Even in the earliest appearances, Hulk spoke in the third person. Hulk retains a modest intelligence, thinking and talking in full sentences, and Lee even gives the Hulk expository dialogue in issue six, allowing readers to learn just what capabilities Hulk has, when the Hulk says, [...] "But these muscles ain't just for show! All I gotta do is spring <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>just</b> keep goin'!" [...] In the 1970s, Hulk was shown as more prone to anger and rage, and less talkative. Writers played {{with the nature of}} his transformations, briefly giving Banner control over the change, and the ability to maintain control of his Hulk form. Artistically and conceptually, the character has become progressively more muscular and powerful in the years since his debut.|$|E
