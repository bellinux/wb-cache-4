25|$|Potassium–argon dating, {{abbreviated}} K–Ar dating, is a radiometric dating {{method used}} in geochronology and archaeology. It {{is based on}} measurement of {{the product of the}} radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium (K) into argon (Ar). Potassium is a common element found in many materials, such as micas, clay minerals, tephra, and evaporites. In these materials, the decay product 40Ar is able to escape the liquid (molten) rock, but starts to accumulate when the rock solidifies (recrystallizes). The amount of Argon sublimation that occurs {{is a function of the}} purity of the sample, the composition of the mother material, and a number of other factors. These factors introduce error limits on the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bounds</b> of dating, so that final determination of age is reliant on the environmental factors during formation, melting, and exposure to decreased pressure and/or open-air. Time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of 40Ar accumulated to the amount of 40K remaining. The long half-life of 40K allows the method to be used to calculate the absolute age of samples older than a few thousand years.|$|E
