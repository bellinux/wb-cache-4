40|$|Please do not quote without {{permission}} of the first author 1 NETWORK STRUCTURE IN VIRTUAL ORGANIZATIONS Virtual organizations, that use email to communicate and coordinate their work toward a common goal, are becoming ubiquitous. However, {{little is known about}} how these organizations work. In this paper, we examine the behavior of one such group and in particular the relationship among task routineness, organizational structure, and performance within this group. Much prior research suggests that virtual organizations, largely {{due to the fact that}} they use information technology to communicate, will be decentralized and non-hierarchical. We empirically measured the structure of a virtual organization and found evidence of hierarchy. Our analysis is based on a case study of the communication structure and content of communications among members of a virtual organization during a four-month period. Results indicate that the fit between structure and task routineness affects the perception of performance, but may not affect the actual performance of the group. The findings of this study imply that the structure of virtual <b>organizations</b> is similar <b>to</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>organizations</b> in so far as fit predicted perceived performance. However, virtual organizations are dissimilar from <b>traditional</b> <b>organizations</b> in so far as fit did not predict objective performance. To the extent that virtual <b>organizations</b> are similar <b>to</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>organizations,</b> we can build on existing theories to study the structure and perceived performance of virtual organizations.

This assessment strategy is also able to characterize in real-time the dynamic associations between cognitive performance and specific daily life behaviors or activities.

In the present study, {{we show that}} this approximately 38, 000 -Mr heparin-regulated protein is electrophoretically and immunologically identical to apolipoprotein E (apo-E), a major plasma apolipoprotein involved in cholesterol transport. In addition, we show that expression of apo-E by cultured SMC varies according to growth state: while proliferating SMC produced little apo-E and expressed low levels of apo-E mRNA, quiescent SMC produced significantly more apo-E (relative to other proteins) and expressed markedly increased levels of apo-E mRNA. Northern analysis of RNA extracted from aortic tissue revealed that fully differentiated, quiescent SMC contain significant quantities of apo-E mRNA.

The relation between paranormal beliefs and illusory agency detection held only for stimuli with low to intermediate ambiguity, but for stimuli with a high number of visual distractors responses of believers and skeptics were at the same level. Furthermore, it was found that illusory agency detection was <b>unrelated</b> <b>to</b> <b>traditional</b> religious belief and belief in witchcraft, whereas paranormal beliefs (i. e.

However, in contrast to usually crowdsourced microtasks, complex software architectures usually consist of tens and hundreds of connected modules that can be potentially crowdsourced. These technical dependencies between modules require active coordination and interactions between crowd members that process the single artifacts.
