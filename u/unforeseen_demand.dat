6000|$|It was a {{long time}} now since Lady Carbury's great {{historical}} work on the Criminal Queens of the World had been completed and given to the world. Any reader careful as to dates will remember that it was as far back as in February that she had solicited the assistance of certain of her literary friends who were connected with the daily and weekly press. These gentlemen had responded to her call with more or less zealous aid, so that the 'Criminal Queens' had been regarded in the trade as one of the successful books of the season. Messrs. Leadham and Loiter had published a second, and then, very quickly, a fourth and fifth edition; and had been able in their advertisements to give testimony from various criticisms showing that Lady Carbury's book was about the greatest historical work which had emanated from the press in the present century. With this object a passage was extracted even from the columns of the 'Evening Pulpit,'--which showed very great ingenuity {{on the part of some}} young man connected with the establishment of Messrs. Leadham and Loiter. Lady Carbury had suffered something in the struggle. What efforts can mortals make as to which there will not be some disappointment? Paper and print cannot be had for nothing, and advertisements are very costly. An edition may be sold with startling rapidity, but it may have been but a scanty edition. When Lady Carbury received from Messrs. Leadham and Loiter their second very moderate cheque, with the expression of a fear on their part that there would not probably be a third,--unless some <b>unforeseen</b> <b>demand</b> should arise,--she repeated to herself those well-known lines from the satirist,-- ...|$|E

50|$|The actual {{site was}} {{selected}} in October 1836 by Edward Bury, {{an engineer and}} locomotive manufacturer of Liverpool, who had been appointed as contractor for working the company's trains in May 1836. Under this arrangement, the company would provide locomotives to Bury's specification while he would maintain them in good repair and convey passengers and goods at a rate per person, per ton and per mile, at a speed not exceeding 22.5 mph. Seven manufacturers, including Bury's firm, supplied the original stock of engines. Because of the <b>unforeseen</b> <b>demand</b> for increased speed, this contract for working the line was annulled in July 1839; thereafter Bury was employed as the Manager of the Locomotive Department on a salary, with a profits bonus.|$|E

Therefore, dynamic scalability is a highly desirable attribute for systems focused on smart manufacturing. Although current manufacturing technology may be considered advanced when compared with other sectors, the highly disruptive and intensive nature of smart manufacturing methodologies may place unpredictable and <b>unforeseen</b> <b>demands</b> on existing information systems. Therefore, technologies and systems focused on smart manufacturing must exhibit the ability to scale seamlessly based on demand.|$|R

The concerns and issues for families now and into the future are conceptualised as ill-structured problems that require an adaptive capacity by all stakeholders in the sector and beyond. The paper gives insights into how an adaptive capacity can be facilitated through formal postgraduate education, and makes the case that being immersed in the discipline of Family Studies generates deep learning that can be applied at many levels of professionals’ work with families. Three core concepts of reflection, knowledge construction and productivity are linked to future expected and <b>unforeseen</b> <b>demands</b> on family professionals, particularly the increasing demand for choosing, implementing, adapting and evaluating evidence-based programmes and evidence-informed practices, as well as measuring the collective impact of activities that support the well-being of families...|$|R

These challenges have attracted significant research efforts in the latest years because of both their relevance and complexity. In this survey, {{for the sake of}} completeness, we cover several new protocols for network interconnection spanning both incremental deployments (evolutionary approach) and radical proposals to redesign the Internet from scratch (clean-slate approach). We focus on specific proposals for future internetworking such as: Loc/ID split, flat routing, network mobility, multipath and content-based routing, path programmability, and Internet scalability. Although there is no consensus on the future internetworking approach, requirements such as security, scalability, and incremental deployment are often considered...|$|R

30|$|Flexibility With {{regards to}} RLT, thus SC flexibility, the results {{indicate}} that SC option 1 is able to react considerably faster to <b>unforeseen</b> <b>demand</b> changes than SC option 2. The RLT of finished goods to Europe reacts quite sensitively to the packaging material bottleneck in SC option 1, but {{at the beginning of the}} PLC, the total lead time, i.e. from supplier to Europe, is much shorter than in SC option 2. This effect can be explained by the fact that the longer lead time from the Asian plant to Europe (SC option 2) requires significantly higher packaging material volumes to be ordered earlier, mainly during capacity ramp-up.|$|E

It discusses the type and reliability of available information and analyses trends in the tropical and temperate zone countries in the region. The place and role of traditional and advanced technologies of tree improvement and breeding are examined {{in the light of}} the need to improve quality and increase production of a range of goods and environmental services which can be derived from forest plantations and tree planting activities, while at the same time ensuring the conservation of the genetic variation necessary in the light of constantly changing environmental conditions and new and often <b>unforeseen</b> <b>demands</b> of society. The paper underlines that forest plantation and tree improvement strategies must form an integral part of sound forest management.

40|$|Keywords- {{intelligent}} agents; microgrid; {{trading of}} electricity; AA with meta control Abstract. One {{of the key}} advantages of the smart grid is its capability to manage the electricity trading automatically between homes and electricity grids {{to cope with the}} inherent real-time dynamic in electricity demand and supply. In this context, this paper presents some advantages and capabilities offered by intelligent agents for trading of electricity in the microgrid. A market-based mechanism and agent trading strategy are developed and studied. Based on the Continuous Double Auction model, the proposed mechanism can deal with <b>unforeseen</b> <b>demand</b> or increased supply capacity in real time. A new trading strategy that can achieve higher market efficiency than previously published well known strategy is also illustrated. The importance of intelligent agents for the distributed control and autonomous operation for the smart grid is demonstrated...|$|E

In its first year the system proved difficult to implement to full effect. <b>Unforeseen</b> emergency <b>demands</b> from the combat theaters for experienced units, an erratic supply of combat-type aircraft for training purposes, and an uneven flow of personnel from the individual training programs produced uneven results that took time and experience to work out. By early 1943, however, the plan was in general operation and became increasingly effective in preparing combat groups for action.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of antibiotics {{has played a}} significant role in combating the dreaded infectious disease such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, typhoid fever and meningitis in 20 th century. However, the improper use of antibiotics led to the {{development of}} multidrug resistance (MDR) in microbial flora raising a global public health concern of 21 st century. This <b>unforeseen</b> threat <b>demands</b> the development of new drugs and strategies for combating antibiotic resistance shown by many microbial species. Recent developments in nanotechnology to engineer nanoparticles with desired physicochemical properties have been projected as a new line of defense against MDR micro-organism. In this review, we summarized and discussed the recent development demonstrating the potential of nanomaterials to evade the MDR. Nanoparticles have shown effective antimicrobial activity against MDR bacteria, such as Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, vancomycin resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and others. Furthermore, new strategies like combination of radiation and drugs with nanoparticle that are being explored to potentiate the effectiveness against MDR bacteria have also been summarized...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in user numbers and bandwidth demands triggered by some new killer applications has always posed difficulties for network operators in supporting these <b>unforeseen</b> bandwidth <b>demands</b> during {{the design and}} planning period of networks. The solution of upgrading the capacity by installing new fibre is not considered as economically viable at this time, as the local access network is always the most cost sensitive section in the entire telecommunications architecture. This is because the overall cost is only shared among {{a limited number of}} end-users. However, the application of WDM techniques to existing Passive Optical Networks (PONs) multiplies the capacity of the original fibre structure and is viewed as one of the approaches the upgrading the capacity of access network. In this paper, a new WDM PON system is proposed where multiple wavelength channels are established for communication in both upstream and downstream directions. The medium access control applied is based on an adaptive polling mechanism, and can be used as an upgrade solution for EPON systems recently proposed and trialled...|$|R

We will introduce a technique for integration of independently developed schemas. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{vision of}} the Smart Grid {{includes}} the creation of intelligent electricity supply networks to allow efficient use of energy resources, reduce carbon emissions and are robust to failures. One of the key assumptions underlying this vision {{is that it will}} be possible to manage the trading of electricity between homes and micro-grids while coping with the inherent real-time dynamism in electricity demand and supply. The management of these trades needs to take into account the fact that most, if not all, of the actors in the system are self-interested and transmission line capacities are constrained. Against this background, we develop and evaluate a novel market-based mechanism and novel trading strategies for the Smart Grid. Our mechanism is based on the Continuous Double Auction (CDA) and automatically manages the congestion within the system by pricing the flow of electricity. We also introduce mechanisms to ensure the system can cope with <b>unforeseen</b> <b>demand</b> or increased supply capacity in real time. Finally, we develop new strategies that we show achieve high market efficiency (typically over 90 %) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{a supply}} chain, <b>unforeseen</b> <b>demand,</b> called bullwhip effect, is problematic. It causes {{increased}} inventory, irregular capacity utilization, and reduced service level.

These supply networks depart from the traditional systematic manufacturing “push ” of products to market that meets not end customer demand only for distribution center. Because of the new technology and globalization that unconstrained by geography, a customer might choose to buy from a brick and mortar retailer nearby but can also shop online for better availability, selection and price, DDSN has focus to around customer actually “pull ” products {{to the point of}} sale.

40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (EngD), at Loughborough University. Effective team working across disciplines is essential to solve the technological and managerial problems associated with construction projects. However, while it is widely accepted that this method of working {{is critical to the}} achievement organisational goals, it is a poorly understood process. Generic best practice recipes on how to improve team work in collaborative projects appears to have had limited impact on performance. Unless the realities of implementing and managing such joint endeavours are conceptualised and articulated in a manner that reflects the actual processes and patterns of behaviour, multi-disciplinary team working will remain a poorly understood working model. The goal of this work was to develop a conceptual framework that visualises the real success factors of multi-disciplinary working so that practitioners can apply a new understanding of predictable processes and patterns of behaviours to improve collaborative project outcomes. To achieve this, the project started with an exploration of critical success factors in multi-disciplinary design projects, encompassing extensive interviewing, workshops and a survey followed by a grounded theory (GT) study of collaborative working in six multi-disciplinary design projects. The switch to GT methodology offered possibilities to further probe into the dynamics of multi-disciplinary team working {{from the perspective of the}} team members. The findings show that team working in multi-disciplinary design projects can be explained through the social process of informalising. Informalising refers to the strategies practitioners use to cope with the multiple pressures and <b>unforeseen</b> <b>demands</b> that pervade the collaborative design environments. It portrays the relevance of managing of expectations and value-judging to remain effective and efficient in the face of change and uncertainty. These are critical factors that influence the project trajectory and experience of those involved. Alongside these results the work also demonstrates the importance of so called super soft factors such as shared values, creativity and innovation and passion and enthusiasm to achieve positive project outcomes. Overall, recognising that the process of informalising forms an essential part of cultivating collaboration, and hence getting the work done, more attention should be given to understand such activity in today s turbulent and transient project organisations. Knowledge and understanding of this form of emergent and improvisational strategy may enable managers to predict and control patterns of behaviour inherent in the management of collaborative design projects, and positively influence project outcomes in terms of perceived value and profit...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the shifting regulatory {{policies in the}} United Kingdom (UK) across three market segments, telecommunications, radio/television and cable, starting with British Telecom’s (BT’s) denationalisation in 1984. For the period examined, this paper focuses on following key events: –The phased liberalisation of the UK communications industry starting with the BT-Mercury Communications duopoly in 1984 –The allocation of cable franchises as regional monopolies in the mid- 1980 s –Introduction of satellite broadcasting {{and the influence of}} British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) Corp. on broadcasting services in the 1990 s –The emergence of the Internet/Web and the subsequent development of a broadband policy from mid- 1990 s onwards Drawing on Dodgson et al. ’s concepts of Market logic, Coordination Logic, and Complex-Evolutionary Logic, the authors argue that the forms of regulation introduced shaped the ways the UK communications industry developed. Thus although the denationalisation grew out of a free market ideology, in practice the free market philosophy was tempered for a number of pragmatic reasons. Prominent among these was a need to create a competitive market in a context where competitors would be unlikely to emerge without regulatory intervention, and an emphasis on price competitiveness to ensure that the end-users benefitted from the best possible prices on available products and services. Subsequent events show that these interventions had unintended consequences. The <b>unforeseen</b> popular <b>demand</b> for Internet/Web access found regulators struggling to find ways to promote a competitive market, and incumbent operators struggling {{to find a way to}} offer a suitable product. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Prompt {{ambulance}} {{attendance is}} aimed at improving patient care. With finite resources struggling to meet performance targets, <b>unforeseen</b> <b>demand</b> precludes the ability to tailor resources to cope with increased call volumes, and can have a marked detrimental effect on performance and hence patient care. The effects of the 2006 World Cup football matches on call volumes and profiles were analysed to understand how public events can influence demands on the ambulance service. Methods: All emergency calls to the Hampshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust (currently the Hampshire Division of South Central Ambulance Service, Winchester, UK) during the first weekend of the 2006 World Cup football matches were analysed by call volume and classification of call (call type). Results: On {{the day of the}} first football match, call volume was over 50 % higher than that on a typical Saturday, with distinct peaks before and after the inaugural match. Call profile analysis showed increases in alcohol-related emergencies, including collapse, unconsciousness, assault and road traffic accidents. The increase in assaults was particularly marked {{at the end of each}} match and increased again into the late evening. Conclusion: A detailed mapping of call volumes and profiles during the World Cup football shows a significant increase in overall emergency calls, mostly alcohol related. Mapping of limited resources to these patterns will allow improved responses to emergency calls...|$|E

University of Pittsburgh 2009 The study {{examines}} the previously <b>unforeseen</b> <b>demand</b> for visionary leadership in education {{created by the}} simultaneous requirement for academically proficient students {{to be able to}} navigate the reality of globalization nested in a newfound conceptual age. Globalization driven by new technologies has ushered in a new conceptual age that requires students to compete on the global stage. Students in this country are competing with the best and brightest from around the world not just with their peers. Furthermore, the new conceptual age that is upon us favors students who are creative, empathetic, artistic, innovative and holistic thinkers.. This is a rich, descriptive, narrative, qualitative study that examines the journey of regional school superintendents. Participants were selected due to their qualifications and experience following a careful protocol. Methods of data collection included semi structured interviews and a personal journal. Data was transcribed and organized into major and minor themes. A personal journal was kept for the purpose of adding reflective thoughts to the study. This research has uncovered a curious pattern indicating visionary superintendents in Western Pennsylvania already possess the types of skills and abilities that we now are expecting our students to acquire to navigate the conceptual age. Another intriguing finding of the study was the evidence that the Western Pennsylvania region serves to create irrepressible visionary leaders. This finding is somewhat surprising as the region is typically thought of as somewhat parochial and not as innovative as other regions of the state and country. The study results which compare the present findings with previous research revealed tangible support for two specific models of visionary leadership found in the literature...|$|E

[...] Owing to the aeronautical focus of Bishop Sheil's vision, the first building erected was a combined hangar, machine shop and classroom structure. A second floor housed a dormitory, electric shop, washroom and office. An administration building was also erected, with dining, kitchen and faculty accommodations. Both were completed and operational in 1932. It {{is interesting to note}} that the original hangar was built well before the school had a single aircraft to maintain, or a runway from which to fly it. That was remedied when the school purchased a damaged Ryan monoplane --sister ship to Lindbergh's -at auction for $510, with the intention of using it for ground training. In 1932 Chicago philanthropist Frank J. Lewis offered his support for the bishop's dream. Earlier that year Lewis lost his son, an aviation enthusiast, in a tragic airplane accident, and he saw an opportunity to create a remembrance.|$|R
40|$|As the {{majority}} of new products fail {{it is important to}} focus on the needs and preferences of the consumers in new product development. Consumers are increasingly recognised as important co-developers of innovations, often developing new functions for technologies, solving <b>unforeseen</b> problems and <b>demanding</b> innovative solutions. The central research question of the paper is: How to understand consumer needs and preferences in the context of new product development in order to improve the success of emerging innovations, such as functional foods. Important variables appear to be domestication, trust and distance, intermediate agents, user representations and the consumer- and product specific characteristics. Using survey and focus group data, we find that consumers need and prefer easy-to-use new products, transparent and accessible information supply by the producer, independent control of efficacy and safety, and introduction of a quality symbol for functional foods. Intermediate agents are not important in information diffusion. Producers should concentrate on consumers with specific needs, like athletes, women, obese persons, and stressed people. This will support developing products in line with the needs and mode of living of the users. consumer needs, preferences, new product development, functional foods...|$|R

40|$|The Teacher’s Skills – Liberal Education and Reflected Experience is a {{case study}} of the {{practical}} skills of teachers, in which the responsible action is central. This is an action which, while informed by science, cannot be fully determined by it, since the circumstances that relate to the interaction between teacher and students cannot always be fully predicted. With Liberal Education, reflection on experience, and trained intuition, the teacher bridges the gap between scientific knowledge and the <b>unforeseen</b> and immediate <b>demands</b> of the situation. The role of Liberal Education in this ambition cannot be overestimated. To be a part of such a practice is to dedicate one’s life to a struggle with language. Therefore, insights into the theory of knowledge and the philosophy of language, as well as analogies with literature and other professional fields, help us examine the glasses through which we observe and interpret reality in order gain greater knowledge. It is in the reflective dialogue, where we meet others with whom we are not always in agreement, that we can see ourselves, our knowledge and our prejudices. The interpretation and re-interpretation of our experience {{in the light of the}} experience of others is the bridge across which we can escape from our imprisonment on the island of convenience. Once the teacher has developed a consistency in his actions, his skills can be acknowledged. When these skills are raised to the level of a style, they become an art. The main purpose of this case study is to describe the teacher’s skills; how it can be developed, and the conditions required for its assessment. A possible assumption is that reflection on our own experience and the experience of others can give us insights into ourselves, an essential prerequisite to striking the spark that motivates the investment of time and resources in the development of one’s skills as a teacherQC 2010070...|$|R
