5|$|With an around-the-clock {{effort by}} the {{shipyard}} workers, Maryland was repaired in 34 days, departing on 13 August. She then embarked for the Solomon Islands with a large task force, anchoring in Purvis Bay off Florida Island for two weeks before steaming for the Palau Islands on 6 September. She then joined Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Western Fire Support Group (Task Group 32.5; TG 32.5). Firing first on 12 September to cover minesweeping operations and <b>underwater</b> <b>demolition</b> teams {{at the opening of}} the Battle of Peleliu, Maryland again conducted shore bombardment supporting the landing craft as they approached the beaches on 15 September. Four days later, organized resistance collapsed, permitting the fire support ships to retire to the Admiralty Islands at the end of the month.|$|E
5|$|Wichita {{arrived in}} Ulithi on 20 March, and was {{assigned}} to Task Force 54 the next day. She put to sea {{to take part in}} the invasion of Okinawa. The ship was placed in Task Unit 54.2.3 to cover minesweepers off Okinawa on 25 March. On the afternoon of the following day, Wichita bombarded Japanese positions on the island, from 13:50 to 16:30. Japanese aircraft attacked the ships early the next morning; Wichitas gunners shot down one of the aircraft. Later that day, the ship resumed bombardment duties in preparation for the amphibious invasion. She continued to shell the island through 28 March. The next day, she retired to Kerama Retto to replenish her ammunition. The ship then returned to Okinawa later that day to cover <b>underwater</b> <b>demolition</b> teams as they cleared beach obstacles. Wichita continued to support the demolition teams the next day, as well as shelling targets ashore. On 31 March, Wichita bombarded the sea wall to create a breach in preparation for the landings.|$|E

Cobb embarked <b>Underwater</b> <b>Demolition</b> Team (UDT) 27. But the following day, 14 August, Japan capitulated, obviating further invasions.|$|E
25|$|Another brief respite at Ulithi preceded her {{deployment}} for the Okinawa operation, {{for which}} she sailed from Ulithi 22 March 1945. After screening heavy ships in the massive pre-invasion bombardment, Cassin Young moved inshore to support the activities of <b>underwater</b> <b>demolition</b> teams preparing the beaches. On invasion day itself, 1 April, the destroyer offered fire support in the assault areas, then took up radar picket duty. On 6 April, Cassin Young endured her first kamikaze attacks with which the Japanese gambled on defeating the Okinawa operation. Cassin Young rescued the survivors of two nearby destroyers that were sunk.|$|E
25|$|On January 6, 1945, while {{supporting}} the landings at Lingayen Gulf, Columbia {{was struck by}} two kamikaze planes, suffering heavy damage and casualties. Swift damage control measures allowed Columbia to complete its bombardment and remain in action to support <b>underwater</b> <b>demolition</b> teams. Three days later, Columbia lay close inshore, with maneuverability hampered by the surrounding landing craft, when struck by a third kamikaze. Again, Columbia extinguished fires and repaired damage, {{and was able to}} complete its bombardment schedule within half an hour of being hit, before departing that night in escort of a group of unloaded transports.|$|E

With 50 men of the Mobile Strike Force embarked, as well as a U.S. Army scout helicopter and a U.S. Navy <b>Underwater</b> <b>Demolition</b> Team (UDT) detachment, Terrell County provided support for multifaceted operations designed to destroy Viet Cong factories, training and supply camps, and extortion stations.

25|$|Following the {{successful}} amphibious assaults in Lingayen Gulf on 9 January, Hall continued {{to operate in}} the Gulf where she served as an escort and screen ship. Later in the month on January 29, she returned to Leyte before departing for Ulithi. At Ulithi Hall joined in the preparations for the upcoming Iwo Jima operation. On 15 February she joined a fire support unit, which included flagship , west of Saipan and set course for Iwo Jima. The force arrived off Iwo the next day; after joining in a heavy shore bombardment, Hall covered <b>underwater</b> <b>demolition</b> teams and furnished close fire support for minesweepers until the troops stormed ashore 19 February. After performing additional patrol and close fire support missions during this fiercely fought and strategically important invasion, Hall returned to Ulithi on 12 March to prepare for the invasion of Okinawa, the last step on the long, bloody road {{to the heart of the}} Japanese Empire.|$|E
25|$|Beginning on 6 January 1945, a heavy naval and air {{bombardment}} of suspected Japanese defenses on Lingayen began. <b>Underwater</b> <b>demolitions</b> began, but found no beach obstacles, and encountered sparse opposing forces.

25|$|At about 00:00 on 17 April 1961, the two CIA LCIs Blagar and Barbara J, {{each with}} a CIA 'operations officer' and an <b>Underwater</b> <b>Demolition</b> Team (UDT) of five frogmen, entered the Bay of Pigs (Bahía de Cochinos) on the {{southern}} coast of Cuba. They headed a force of four transport ships (Houston, Río Escondido, Caribe and Atlántico) carrying about 1,400 Cuban exile ground troops of Brigade 2506, plus tanks and other vehicles in the landing craft. At about 01:00, Blagar, as the battlefield command ship, directed the principal landing at Playa Girón (code-named Blue Beach), led by the frogmen in rubber boats followed by troops from Caribe in small aluminium boats, then LCVPs and LCUs. Barbara J, leading Houston, similarly landed troops 35km further northwest at Playa Larga (code-named Red Beach), using small fiberglass boats. Unloading troops at night was delayed, due to engine failures and boats damaged by unforeseen coral reefs. As the frogmen came in, they were shocked {{to discover that the}} Red Beach was lit with floodlights, which led to the location of the landing being hastily changed. As the frogmen landed, a firefight broke out when a jeep carrying Cuban militia happened by. The few militia in the area succeeded in warning Cuban armed forces via radio soon after the first landing, before the invaders overcame their token resistance. Castro was woken up at about 3:15 am to be informed of the landings, which led him to put all militia units in the area on the highest state of alert and to order airstrikes. The Cuban regime planned to strike the brigadistas at Playa Larga first as they were inland before turning on the brigadistas at Girón at the sea. El Comandante departed personally to lead his forces into battle against the brigadistas.|$|E
