40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2004 The lack of {{research}} on the common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) in Interior Alaska prompted this study. My objectives were to estimate duckling survival relative to several explanatory variables and to characterize incubation behaviors in a subset of females nesting in the Chena River State Recreation Area. My estimates of duckling survival were higher than previously reported for this species: 0. 65 (95 % CI 0. 49 to 0. 82) and 0. 68 (95 % CI 0. 58 to 0. 79) for 2002 and 2003 respectively. Seasonally, duckling survival increased linearly throughout 2002, remained nearly constant in 2003, and was negatively related to daily precipitation in both years. Nest attendance patterns and incubation behaviors were not related to weather, female experience, clutch size, or day of incubation. Average number <b>of</b> <b>recesses</b> per day (2. 9 ± 0. 05), <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>recesses</b> (100. 7 ± 1. 5 min), and incubation constancy (79. 8 ± 0. 3 %) were similar to values previously reported for this species (mean ± SE).

A total of seven nests was observed. We measured the following factors for daylight hours: percentage of time the female was on the nest (attendance), <b>length</b> <b>of</b> attendance bouts by the female, <b>length</b> <b>of</b> nest <b>recesses,</b> and adult provisioning rates. Comparisons were made between three stages of the 40 -day nesting cycle: incubation (day I-day 16), early nestling stage (day 17 -day 30 [i. e., nestlings 14 days old]). Of seven nests observed, four fledged at least one nestling and three failed. One of these failed nests was filmed being depredated by a feral cat (Felis catus). Female nest attendance was near 82 % during the incubation stage and decreased to 21 % as nestlings aged. We did not detect a difference in attendance bout <b>length</b> between stages <b>of</b> the nesting cycle. Mean <b>length</b> <b>of</b> nest <b>recesses</b> increased from 4. 5 min during the incubation stage to over 45 min during the late nestling stage.

40|$|For many {{bird species}} in captivity best {{practice}} for incubation procedures {{have yet to}} be developed. This is hampered by a lack of cooperation between bird breeders or by a reluctance to experiment on valuable eggs. The last two problems may be solved by observation of natural incubation, which technology has made a lot easier. Many studies document incubation behavior: daily time spend in the nest, preferred hours of making absences, egg turning rate, incubation temperature. Such data is scientifically interesting but also allows for better protection of endangered species through development of captive breeding programmes. The Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) is a threatened species over much of its European range and various conservation actions are being taken to save populations from global or local extinction. Our study took place in Capercaillie Breeding Centre in Wisła Forestry District and describes nesting and incubation behaviour of Capercaillie females kept in captivity. Our aim was to better document the nesting behaviour by recording egg turning rate, and the time and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> incubation <b>recesses.</b> Time <b>of</b> day and day of incubation had no significant influence on <b>recess</b> <b>length,</b> but number <b>of</b> <b>recesses</b> was related with time of day with two peaks at 06 : 00 h and 18 : 00 h.

40|$|Patterns of {{incubation}} and nesting {{behavior for}} {{many species of}} birds, especially those with cryptic nests, {{have been difficult to}} obtain due to logistical and technological limitations. As a result, {{little is known about the}} daily attendance rhythms and behavioral patterns of many species, including the Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), despite this species being one of the most studied birds in the world. Incubation represents parental investment in offspring, and a multitude of factors may affect investment behaviors, including reproductive ecology, sex and age of parent, habitat quality, clutch age, and timing in the nesting season. Most Northern Bobwhite nests are incubated by a single adult, most often by females, but also by some males. We assessed the nest attendance patterns and parental investment in bob-white clutches (n 118) using continuous near-infrared video of nests being incubated by male or female bobwhites. We found that incubating parents took 0 – 3 recesses per day. A single recess was most common for 87 % of nest-days, and most of these were during mid-day to late afternoon (12 : 00 19 : 00). Mean total daily recess time was 182 min (95 % CI: 98 – 264) for nests that hatched and 224 min (95 % CI: 140 – 308) for nests that failed. We observed no difference between sexes in the number or <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>recesses</b> taken, but females initiated recess later in the day (median start time 15 : 00) than males (median start time 14 : 00).

Controlling for age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity, education, income, fruit and vegetable consumption, current smoking and alcohol use, we found that: (1) foreign-born adults had lower BMI than US-born adults; (2) among foreign-born adults, longer residence in the United States was associated with higher BMI; and (3) the effect of birthplace-length of US residence on BMI differed by education level, gender and race/ethnicity. Specifically, longer residence in the United States was associated with the greatest percent increases in BMI among the lowest educated groups than higher educated groups, among women (vs. men) and among Hispanics (vs. other racial/ethnic groups).

We performed a 3 D balanced fast-field echo imaging technique (3 D-bFFE) to obtain detailed anatomy of the cisternal {{segments of}} CNs IX, X, and XI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3 D-bFFE was used to image the cisternal {{segments of the}} lower CNs in 20 healthy volunteers. As an anatomic landmark, CSF recesses adjacent to the JF were divided into 3 parts: the recess for the cochlear aqueduct, the recess for CN IX, and the recess for the CN X/XI complex. MR images were evaluated to identify the cisternal segment of each cranial nerve in relation to these anatomic landmarks. RESULTS: The mean angles <b>of</b> the <b>recess</b> for the cochlear aqueduct for CN IX and CN X/XI to the posterior petrous bone were 41. 6 2. 5 °, 69. 7 3. 1 °, and 76. 0 3. 4 °, respectively (P. 01).

Methods: To conduct an economic evaluation of procalcitonin testing versus usual care we built a cost-impact model based on patient-level meta-analysis data of randomized trials. The meta-analytic data was adapted to the US setting by applying the meta-analytic results to <b>US</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> stay, costs, and practice patterns. We estimated the annual ARI visit rate for the one million member cohort, by setting (inpatient, ICU, outpatient) and ARI diagnosis. Results: In the inpatient setting, the costs of procalcitonin-guided compared to usual care for the one million member cohort was $ 2, 083, 545, compared to $ 2, 780, 322, resulting in net savings of nearly $ 700, 000 to the IDN for 2014. In the ICU and outpatient settings, savings were $ 73, 326 and $ 5, 329, 824, respectively, summing up to overall net savings of $ 6, 099, 927 for the cohort. Results were robust for all ARI diagnoses. For the whole US insured population, procalcitonin-guided care would result in $ 1. 6 billion in savings annually. Conclusions: Our results show substantial savings associated with procalcitonin protocols of ARI across common US treatment settings mainly by direct reduction in unnecessary antibiotic utilization. These results are robust to changes in key parameters, and the savings can be achieved without any negative impact on treatment outcomes...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess treatments and costs associated with blood and blood product transfusions in a historical cohort of 189, 457 inpatients in the US and 34, 987 inpatients in Belgium undergoing knee or hip surgery. Methods: Descriptive analysis, logistic regression and ordinary least squares regression were used to describe the factors associated with the use and cost of allogeneic blood transfusion. Results: Hospitalisation costs for joint replacement surgery totalled $ 12, 718 (SD= 6, 356) and averaged 4. 33 days in the US, while costs in Belgium were $ 6, 526 (SD= 3, 192) and averaged 17. 1 days. The use of low molecular weight heparin and tranexamic acid was much higher in Belgium than the US (36 % and 99 % compared to 0 % and 40 %, respectively).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses Korean Americans as {{speakers of}} English {{and as a}} unified speech community by exploring {{the nature and extent}} of sociolinguistic stratification of the English used by Korean Americans in Philadelphia. The acquisition of three linguistic features is investigated: word-medial /t/ flapping, the use of discourse markers, and the regional feature of Philadelphia short a. Statistical analyses examine these features for the effects of linguistic factors and social factors such as sex, age, education, occupation, age of arrival in the <b>US,</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> stay in the US, and English education. Age of arrival shows a very strong effect on flapping in that immigrants who arrived in the US as children and US-born immigrants both show a very high degree of flapping, while Korean-born adult immigrants acquire flapping to a much lesser degree. Style is also analyzed to determine whether speakers show variation along the formality continuum. In addition to production, the perceptual component of English use by the speakers is examined through a perception test. The perception test, administered to native English speakers, elicits judgments of English nativeness and ethnic identity of the Korean Americans. The results of the perception test are correlated with the production results of the linguistic features. In general, Korean Americans show varying degrees of acquisition of the three features according to sociolinguistic factors. Although the speakers exhibit stylistic variation, they have not acquired the Philadelphia dialectal feature of short a The perception test reveals that English nativeness is accurately judged but that ethnic identification is problematic for listeners. The correlation of production and perception is positive in that an increase in the presence of the native linguistic features in the speech being judged is correlated with increased perception of the degree of English nativeness. The three features examined are not taught through formal explicit instruction to either native or non-native English speakers, which implies that speakers must engage in face-to-face interaction with native speakers in order to acquire these native speech community norms. ...|$|R

Because only a minority of patients who have a stroke are currently eligible for thrombolysis, implementation of specialised and standardised stroke care may further enhance cost benefits and improve patient outcomes.

5000|$|In every {{beginning}} trigonometry course, one {{learns that}} in a triangle whose sides have lengths 1, 2, and &radic;3, the angles 30&deg;, 90&deg;, and 60&deg;. Thus when two such triangles are placed in the positions shown in the illustration, one gets a right angle between the sides <b>of</b> <b>length</b> 2, and the smallest rectangle that has sides built from the legs of those two triangles has length 1 + &radic;3 and width &radic;3. The Pythagorean theorem applied to either {{of two of the}} four triangles shown tells <b>us</b> that the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the one side that those two triangles share is 2&radic;2. Observing which angles are 30&deg; and which are 60&deg; tells us that in the triangle whose legs have lengths &radic;3 + 1 and &radic;3 − 1, the two small angles are 15&deg; and 75&deg;.
