However, a strength calculation solution, in which bending stresses, contact stresses, and bulk temperatures are included, combined with gear design standards for <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> drives, is still not constructed due to complex <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> teeth.

Thus, in the study, a calculation solution of static transmission errors (STE) of <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> drives associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks is constructed, based on the proposed equivalent <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> drives, and a four-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model of <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> drives is formulated. The dynamic behaviors of an example case of <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> drives associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks are investigated. The simulation results indicate natural frequencies of <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> drives would be decreased with pinion dedendum fatigue crack extensions; the relationship between accelerations and velocities of <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> drives, dynamic mesh forces, and vibration accelerations at bearings would also be changed. However, pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> drives are detected difficultly, due to simulation result similarities. Therefore, a determination solution for pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> drives is proposed.

40|$|The use of <b>face</b> <b>gears</b> in an {{advanced}} rotorcraft transmission design was first {{proposed by the}} McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company during their contracted effort with the U. S. Army under the Advanced Rotorcraft Transmission (ART) program. <b>Face</b> <b>gears</b> {{would be used to}} turn the corner between the horizontal gas turbine engine and the vertical output rotor shaft [...] a function currently done by spiral bevel gears. This novel gearing arrangement would substantially lower the drive system weight partly because a <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> mesh would be used to split the input power between two output gears. However, the use of <b>face</b> <b>gears</b> and their ability to operate successfully at the speeds and loads required for an aerospace environment was unknown. Therefore a proof-of-concept phase with an existing test stand at the NASA Lewis Research Center was pursued. Hardware was designed that could be tested in Lewis' Spiral Bevel Gear Test Rig. The initial testing indicated that the <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> mesh was a feasible design that could be used at high speeds and load. Surface pitting fatigue was the typical failure mode, and that could lead to tooth fracture. An interim project was conducted to see if slight modifications to the gear tooth geometry or an alternative heat treating process could overcome the surface fatigue problems. From the initial and interim tests, it was apparent that for the surface fatigue problems to be overcome the manufacturing process used for this component would have to be developed to the level used for spiral bevel gears. The current state of the art for <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> manufacturing required using less than optimal gear materials and manufacturing techniques because the surface of the tooth form does not receive final finishing after heat treatment as it does for spiral bevel gears. This resulted in less than desirable surface hardness and manufacturing tolerances.

Because of its small space, high contact ratio, large transmission torque, low vibration and noise, not {{sensitive to the}} axial phase error of the worm and so on, <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> transmission is widely applied. In the traditional gear transmission dynamic contact analysis (TCA), first, simulate the meshing equation; second, calculate the contact trajectory that is formed by the adherent point; last, solve each of the instantaneous contact areas and solve tooth contact region in meshing process.
