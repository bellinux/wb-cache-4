40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to quantitatively analyze the {{residential}} land use characteristic of spatial form heterogeneity based on the analysis of evolvement process of the land use form in urban fringes，and to establish corresponding patterns to readjust the residential land use form. Method of information entropy analysis was employed in this paper. The result shows that: (1) Residential land use system in <b>urban</b> <b>fringes</b> is a complicated and macro system with dissipative. It has orderly characteristics of function and structure. The spatial form of residential land rest with the evolvement time and original land use mode. Accordingly, spatial form heterogeneity of residential land in <b>urban</b> <b>fringes</b> is influenced by land evolvement phases and original land use mode. (2) The information entropy values are of guiding significance to the spatial form heterogeneity of the residential land in <b>urban</b> <b>fringes</b> as they can reflect the form of land use in different regions in a certain period of time. (3) Taking use of the land use constitution data which gathered form the sample residential areas in <b>urban</b> <b>fringes</b> of Beijing, this paper conducts analysis on the spatial form heterogeneity of residential land of Beijing, the result shows that, there are 4 types land use forms in the <b>urban</b> <b>fringes</b> of Beijing based on the result of calculating the entropy values of different regions.

40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>fringes</b> {{represent}} {{very complex}} landscapes {{because of their}} proximity and mutual dependency with cities and rural areas. These landscapes may be considered as transition entities characterized by fuzzy boundaries. An uncontrolled development of urban sprawl and land use changes in these areas may deter- mine negative impacts on all natural, economic and social components. Thus, <b>urban</b> <b>fringes</b> assume a key-role in modern landscape analysis, planning and management. Landscape analysis of these interfaces, as this study shows, can be effectively supported by GIS spatial modelling. The Settlement Density Index (SDI), developed through GIS spatial analysis techniques, expresses punctually the territorial gradients generated {{by the presence of}} settlements and allows the identification of the <b>urban</b> <b>fringes</b> in the two periods under invest-tigation. These areas are then characterized and analyzed quantitatively using detailed land use data. The comparison of the diachronic information highlights the transformations of peri-urban landscapes that appear mainly related to the modifications of spatial configuration of urban areas and to the changes of agricultural systems...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the case}} of Bologna, {{a city with a}} strong planning and urban design tradition, inquiring {{about the ways in which}} the design of the <b>urban</b> <b>fringes</b> has been addressed in the last years. In particular, the paper analyses the transformations of Bologna’ east areas where recent projects composed by commercial centres, a business park, a new district for the University are recently realized or under development. All these elements and projects are in close relation with a rural landscape and with the project for a future agricultural park planned and design by the Municipality. The proposed interpretation is that in Bologna the <b>urban</b> <b>fringes</b> are part of an enlarged vision for the city at the territorial scale: the fringes are a field for experimentation about new urban conditions, hybrid and innovative at the same time. Thus, these interventions should be considered not only ‘in itself’, but in relation with the ability to become part of a territorial vision, to define a space of quality and continuity within a wider metropolitan dimension. The <b>urban</b> <b>fringes</b> are analysed as a place to define different condition of urbanity with jointed urban-rural features and new living conditions at the territorial scale...|$|R

This paper addresses the urgent need to consider polycentric functional service clustering in the <b>urban</b> <b>fringes</b> based on empirical evidence gathered in Vienna, Austria, which served as a case study. A spatial scan statistic is applied to detect local spatial clusters of services and the bivariate K(d) -function is used to investigate the spatial interaction between each nucleus. Due to some significant functional clusters, it has been concluded that agglomeration economies are still of prime interest. Furthermore, some significant attraction between the studied clusters is investigated. Overall, the results do not contradict the concept of postsuburbia yet, which is why a paradigm shift must be ruled out...|$|R
25|$|Dumfries is a {{relatively}} prosperous community but the town centre has {{been exposed to the}} centrifugal forces that have seen retail, business, educational, residential and other uses gravitate towards the town's <b>urban</b> <b>fringe.</b> This was started in the 1980s with the building of the Dumfries bypass. The immediate effect of this was as intended the diversion of transiting traffic away from the town centre. This brought with it an accompanying reduction in economic input to the town centre. The second effect of this has been more pronounced. Sites close to the bypass have attracted development to utilise the bypass as a high speed urban highway without the bottlenecks of the town centre and without the constraining limited town centre parking.|$|E

40|$|AbstractToday <b>urban</b> <b>fringes</b> {{represent}} {{the reversal of}} the traditional relationship between {{the city and the}} surrounding area than in the past. They can be considered as one of the paradigmatic changes in the relationships between the components of the landscape. Among them there are the physical, as the social, political, economic, cultural ones. In observing the cityscape, however, we can realize how many open areas are no longer able to maintain their original agricultural functions. A lot of them have become abandoned areas waiting for future urbanization where urban and rural conditions co-exist side by side without any dialogue. Dealing with this state of things, the paper suggests some planning guidelines in terms of approaches and methods, focusing on how the <b>urban</b> <b>fringes</b> can become the place where interweave a fruitful dialogue between city and country. The aim is to bring out novel considerations regarding the components of the open territory and their relationship. Town planning shows some delay in handling dynamics affecting <b>urban</b> <b>fringes.</b> However, more and more new urban agriculture initiatives spread out by inhabitants who recognize the potential of such as areas in terms of farm income and valuable resources. Recent experiences show that the recovery of the agricultural function, especially in urban and peri-urban area, can help to combat the consumption of soil and the spread of urbanization. Urban farming can also redevelop and improve the quality of open spaces, promoting new forms of solidarity economy, creating new employment, generating wide spread active citizenship behaviours and care of the land...|$|R

2500|$|In the mid-20th century, {{with the}} rise of the suburb and {{automobile}} culture in the United States, a new style of shopping center was created away from downtown. Early shopping centers designed for the automobile include Market Square, Lake Forest, Illinois (1916), and Country Club Plaza, Kansas City, Missouri (1924). From early on, the design tended to be inward-facing, with malls following theories of how customers could best be enticed in a controlled environment. Similar, the concept of a mall having one or more [...] "anchor stores" [...] or [...] "big box stores" [...] was pioneered early, with individual stores or smaller-scale chain stores intended to benefit from the shoppers attracted by the big stores. Mall construction in America was encouraged by the accelerated depreciation laws of 1954, which incentivized greenfield development on the <b>urban</b> <b>fringe.</b> A second stimulus came from legislation passed in 1960, which allowed investors to band together in REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) to avoid corporate income taxes.

40|$|Understanding of <b>urban</b> <b>fringes</b> or peri-urban {{interfaces}} (PUIs) as zones characterised by rapid transitional {{change and}} sprawling urbanisation has increased markedly over recent years. Archaeological evidence also illustrates the pivotal role that peri-urban zones once {{played in the}} survivability of ancient urban centres.

Furthermore, ongoing global environmental change (GEC) and increasing socioeconomic inequality are generating new priorities as peri-urban zones consolidate, erode and shift outwards. Given the inadequacies of existing frameworks, we advocate a hybrid approach to PUI planning and design that draws on integrated, agropolitan-type perspectives embedded within a resilient, locally appropriate regional-urban focus within broader sociospatial and geo-economic systems. Diverse historical and contemporary examples inform the discussion of the PUI planning and design and the identification of policy recommendations for a hybrid planning approach based on adaptation capacity and resilience...|$|R
