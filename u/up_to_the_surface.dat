5|$|The {{earliest}} pathologic {{change is}} {{the formation of a}} plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle. In normal skin, the skin cells that have died come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> and exit the pore of the hair follicle. However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the hair follicle. If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).|$|E

25|$|Thermotaxis is {{movement}} along a gradient of temperature. The slugs {{have been}} shown to migrate along extremely shallow gradients of only 0.05°C/cm, but the direction chosen is complicated; it seems to be away from a temperature about 2°C below the temperature to which they had been acclimated. This complicated behavior has been analyzed by computer modeling of the behavior and the periodic pattern of temperature changes in soil caused by daily changes in air temperature. The conclusion is that the behavior moves slugs a few centimeters below the soil surface <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> This is an amazingly sophisticated behavior by a primitive organism with no apparent sense of gravity.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another use}} of philodendrons is for {{catching}} fish. A tribe in the Colombian Amazon {{is known to}} use Philodendron craspedodromum to add poison to the water, temporarily stunning the fish, which rise <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> {{where they can be}} easily scooped up. To add the poison to the water, the leaves are cut into pieces and tied together to form bundles, which are allowed to ferment for a few days. The bundles are crushed and added to the water into which the poison will dissipate. Although the toxicity of Philodendron craspedodromum is not fully known, active ingredients in the poisoning of the fish possibly are coumarins formed during the fermentation process.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to decreasing dissolved oxygen {{level in the}} environment, fish swim <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the water column and ventilate at {{the top layer of}} the water where it contains relatively higher level of dissolved oxygen, a behavior called aquatic surface respiration (ASR). Oxygen diffuses into water from air and therefore the top layer of water in contact with air contains more oxygen. This is true only in stagnant water; in running water all layers are mixed together and oxygen levels are the same throughout the water column. One environment where ASR often takes place is tidepools, particularly at night. Separation from the sea at low tide means that water is not renewed, fish crowding within the pool means that oxygen is quickly depleted, and absence of light at night means that there is no photosynthesis to replenish the oxygen. Examples of tidepool species that perform ASR include the tidepool sculpin, Oligocottus maculosus, the three-spined stickleback, and the mummichog.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the surface}} water of deep {{tropical}} lakes never reaches {{the temperature of}} maximum density, there is no process that makes the water mix. The deeper layer becomes oxygen starved and can become saturated with carbon dioxide, or other gases such as sulfur dioxide if {{there is even a}} trace of volcanic activity. Exceptional events, such as earthquakes or landslides, can cause mixing which rapidly brings the deep layers <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> and release a vast cloud of gas which lay trapped in solution in the colder water {{at the bottom of the}} lake. This is called a limnic eruption. An example is the disaster at Lake Nyos in Cameroon. The amount of gas that can be dissolved in water is directly related to pressure. As deep water surfaces, the pressure drops and a vast amount of gas comes out of solution. Under these circumstances carbon dioxide is hazardous because it is heavier than air and displaces it, so it may flow down a river valley to human settlements and cause mass asphyxiation.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to taking {{a wide range}} prey, gulls display great versatility in how they obtain prey. Prey can be obtained in the air, on water, or on land. In the air, a number of hooded species are able to hawk insects on the wing; larger species perform this feat more rarely. Gulls on the wing also snatch items both off water and off the ground, and over water they also plunge-dive to catch prey. Again, smaller species are more manoeuvrable and better able to hover-dip fish from the air. Dipping is also common when birds {{are sitting on the}} water, and gulls may swim in tight circles or foot paddle to bring marine invertebrates <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> Food is also obtained by searching the ground, often on the shore among sand, mud or rocks. Larger gulls tend to do more feeding in this way. In shallow water gulls may also engage in foot paddling. A method of obtaining prey unique to gulls involves dropping heavy shells of clams and mussels onto hard surfaces. Gulls may fly some distance to find a suitable surface on which to drop shells, and apparently a learned component to the task exists, as older birds are more successful than younger ones. While overall feeding success is a function of age, the diversity in both prey and feeding methods is not. The time taken to learn foraging skills may explain the delayed maturation in gulls.|$|E

25|$|The {{beginning}} of nest building is {{preceded by a}} courtship ritual. This pair formation consists of {{the male and female}} swimming parallel to each other, the male and female facing each other and contacting their barbels, the male stimulating the flanks of the female, the swimming to the surface by the male and female and production of the first bubbles at the nest site, and adding further bubbles to the nest under construction. The male produces most of the foam. First, the male and female come to the surface and swim belly-up in small circles. The film of the air-water interface is swallowed and pumped out through the gills, where it gains mucus. Movement of the pelvic fins stirs the water and mucus, captures air bubbles, and breaks these air bubbles into a foam. The female may add some bubbles to the nest under construction. Pelvic fin movement differs between sexes; males move their pelvic fins in a side-to-side fashion, while females open and close their pelvic fins. The male often dives to the bottom to retrieve plant debris; filamentous nest materials are preferred, which are knitted together in the nest by the male. The male creates an upward water current with its tail fin that lift plant materials up. Then, the male uses its developed pectoral fin spines to cary the plant materials to the nest. The male uses its mouth and pectoral fins to incorporate the plant material into the foam mass of the nest. Females neither have developed pectoral fin spines nor do they help in transporting plant debris. The end result is a dome-shaped nest made up of loosely interwoven plant material on top of tightly interwoven plant material, held <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> with a layer of foam; the eggs will be laid on top of this foam from below.|$|E

With the drilling of deep boreholes into the earth, the Chinese used not only derricks to lift brine <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> to be boiled into salt, but also set up bamboo-crafted pipeline transport systems which brought natural gas as fuel to the furnaces. Smelting techniques were enhanced with inventions such as the waterwheel-powered bellows; the resulting widespread distribution of iron tools facilitated the growth of agriculture. For tilling the soil and planting straight rows of crops, the improved heavy-moldboard plough with three iron plowshares and sturdy multiple-tube iron seed drill were invented in the Han, which greatly enhanced production yields and thus sustained population growth. The method of supplying irrigation ditches with water was improved with {{the invention of the}} mechanical chain pump powered by the rotation of a waterwheel or draft animals, which could transport irrigation water up elevated terrains.
