In the second stage, evolved group mo-tion behaviors from the rst stage are used alongside existing high-level parametric rules for local articulated motion...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a result of {{research}} activities within wearable communications carried out at the Ericsson Norway Applied research center in collaboration with the University of Oslo.

40|$|Increasing {{provision}} of public {{information on the}} internet is being driven by eGovernment initiatives worldwide. With this increase, however, there is little consideration of users. <b>Usability</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a core tenet of public geographic information provision. The central principle of usability design is that “Any system designed for people to use <b>should</b> <b>be</b> easy to learn (and remember), useful, that is, contain functions people really need in their work, and be easy and pleasant to use” (Gould & Lewis 1985, 300).

30|$|This case thus {{illustrates}} {{the point that}} the evaluation process can help stakeholders construct and tell stories in support of their goals.

Indeed, “relying on complicated financial models can damage stories, inviting endless debates about assumptions and making it difficult to relate meaningful arguments to senior managers.” The interviews also suggested that integration and operation strategies were important parts of this storytelling process. Those strategies helped reduce concerns about uncertainty, allay doubts about the buyer’s capabilities, please related teams, and explain the deal to managers who would be responsible for the implementation process later on. The interviewees also noted that benchmarking analysis documenting similar cases would help convince others.|$|R
30|$|The ideal {{surgical}} simulator should {{satisfy the}} following three conditions. First, it should reflect patient-specific anatomical information that is input into the simulator.

Third, the user interface <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>intuitive.</b> Currently, some computer simulators are available for surgical training, but most have limited, pre-programmed scenarios [1],[4],[6].

However, this existing system is not interactive, so the steps of the operation cannot be simulated. This general-purpose software can be applied easily to various organs and simulate the procedure in a step-by-step fashion. Third, <b>intuitive</b> control <b>is</b> achieved with a 3 D tactile mouse.
