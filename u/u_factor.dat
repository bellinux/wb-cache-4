40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to present an {{efficient}} implementation of an explicit matrix inversion of general square matrices on multicore computer architecture. The inversion procedure is split into four steps: 1) computing the LU factorization, 2) inverting the upper triangular <b>U</b> <b>factor,</b> 3) solving a linear system, whose solution yields inverse of the original matrix and 4) applying backward column pivoting on the inverted matrix. Using a tile data layout, which represents the matrix in the system memory with an optimized cacheaware format, the computation of the four steps is decomposed into computational tasks. A directed acyclic graph is generated on the fly which represents the program data flow. Its nodes represent tasks and edges the data dependencies between them. Previous implementations of matrix inversions, available in the state-of-the-art numerical libraries, are suffer from unnecessary synchronization points, which are non-existent in our implementation in order to fully exploit the parallelism of the underlying hardware. Our algorithmic approach allows to remove these bottlenecks and to execute the tasks with loose synchronization.

This report investigates the feasibility of implementing solar energy production in two different rural locations around the world. The two proposed research sites are Menzies, Western Australia, Australia, and Kwale, Kwale County, Kenya.

In this study, protein S was shown to increase the inactivation of purified Factor VIII by APC ninefold. The reaction rate was saturated {{with respect to the}} concentration of protein S when protein S was present in a 10 -fold molar excess over APC. The heavy chain of Factor VIII was cleaved by APC and protein S did not alter the degradation pattern. Factor VIII circulates in a complex with the adhesive protein von Willebrand factor. When purified Factor VIII was recombined with von Willebrand factor, the inactivation of Factor VIII by APC proceeded at a 10 - 20 -fold slower rate as compared with Factor VIII in the absence of von Willebrand factor. Protein S had no effect on the inactivation of the Factor VIII-von Willebrand factor complex by APC. After treatment of this complex with thrombin, however, the actions of APC and protein S towards Factor VIII were completely restored. In hemophilia A plasma, purified Factor VIII associated with endogenous von Willebrand factor, resulting in a complete protection against APC (4 nM).

Within the Frenkel tight-binding method, the physical quantities that determine the band structure are the intermolecular resonance interactions. The density functions for the first excited singlet states of crystalline benzene and naphthalene are determined experimentally from spectral data involving band ↔ band transitions. The experimental results are not {{in complete agreement with}} a transition octopole model for the intermolecular interactions. Mixed molecular crystals provide theoretically and experimentally tractable systems for studying the properties of molecular aggregates. This knowledge is basic to understanding the liquid and biological states and may in the future be of significant technological importance. Spectroscopic observations on isotopic mixed crystals of naphthalene are made to determine the energy of the crystal states that correlate with the 1 B 2 u state of the free naphthalene molecule. The spectral data for the dilute crystals are interpreted in terms of a one-particle Green's function and are consistent with the band structure as observed in band ↔ band transitions. The transition energies of guest levels disagree with a model involving configuration interaction with charge transfer states. New theoretical models are suggested, and the data available for evaluating these models are outlined. Very high resolution spectra at 4. 2 °K reveal fine structure in the 1 B 2 u ← 1 A g and 3 B Iu → 1 A g electromc trans 1 t 10 ns of the naphthalene mixed crystals.

Surveys measured social cognitive constructs including self-efficacy (SE), outcome expectations (OE), food environment (FE), and goals (G); items from Project EAT (EAT) and the Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire (WELQ) were also used. The first objective {{of the study was to}} investigate surveys for reliability using Cronbach???s ?? and principal components analysis (PCA). Cronbach???s ?? assessed internal consistency while PCA compared underlying data patterns with previously published item groupings. Second, validity was assessed through comparison of these two methods. Third, psychometric properties of surveys were compared among normal- and overweight subjects. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using baseline height and weight data; subjects were then categorized as normal- or overweight using classifications issued by the National Institutes of Health. If scales had adequate Cronbach???s ?? values (?? > ~ 0. 70), composite scores were calculated as mean scores of all items within a construct. Composite scores for reliable constructs were compared by BMI category using Mann-Whitney <b>U.</b> <b>Factor</b> structures for the different surveys were also compared with PCA using body mass index (BMI) category as an independent variable. SE, OE, EAT, and WELQ had good internal consistency (?? > ~ 0. 70) based on previously published item groupings. Previous groupings were not available for G and FE, so only those indicated by PCA were tested for internal consistency; ?? values were high for G subscales but were not adequate for FE. Agreement between PCA and Cronbach???s ?? indicated that the item grouping for OE was a valid reflection of the construct; most SE and EAT constructs were also similar when comparing the two methods. WELQ groupings for PCA vs. Cronbach???s ?? original groupings were considerably different than described, indicating that these groupings may not be valid in this sample and other groupings may be more reliable. Scales may better address population concerns by integrating such issues as social pressure, emotional eating, food availability, and alcohol use. FE should be refined and further tested due to low ?? values. Only a few composite scores were significantly different according to BMI. Overweight subjects were more concerned about their weight (p<. 01) and had lower SE to consume vegetables when physical effort is required (p<. 05). More obvious differences were seen through PCA, with factor structures differing by BMI for each questionnaire except for OE. Normal- and overweight subjects may have varying cognitive patterns regarding nutrition and health, possibly due to differing influences and habits regarding health behaviors. Questionnaires may not have been constructed so that items had the same meaning for all subjects; psychosocial variables may not have been adequately measured in order to make valid comparisons. An additional finding was that in the sample as a whole, scores were very positive for OE but less so for SE and WELQ. Scores for G indicated that subjects had goals to incorporate fruits & vegetables and calcium-rich foods less often as compared to lower-fat foods. EAT scores were mostly positive except for weight concern and taste barriers. Due to less positive scores for SE, G, certain WELQ subscales (availability, social pressure, emotional eating), and taste barriers from EAT, interventions in this population may be more successful by incorporating strategies to overcome these barriers...|$|E
