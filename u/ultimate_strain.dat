This information is available in Victor C. Li's article on (ECC)- Tailored Composites through Micromechanical Modeling. http://www.engineeredcomposites.com/publications/csce_tailoredecc_98.pdf The first property listed, the ultimate tensile strength of 4.6 MPa, is slightly larger than the accepted tensile strength of standard fiber-reinforced concretes, (4.3 MPa). More notable, however, is the extremely high <b>ultimate</b> <b>strain</b> value of 5.6% when compared to most FRC's <b>ultimate</b> <b>strain</b> values ranging in the few hundredths of a percent. The first crack stress and first crack strain values are significantly low compared to normal concrete, both {{the result of the}} multiple crack phenomenon associated with HPFRCCs.|$|E
50|$|The {{appearance}} of necking in ductile materials {{is associated with}} geometrical instability in the system. Due to the natural inhomogeneity of the material, {{it is common to}} find some regions with small inclusions or porosity within it or surface, where strain will concentrate, leading to a locally smaller area than other regions. For strain less than the ultimate tensile strain, the increase of work-hardening rate in this region will be greater than the area reduction rate, thereby make this region harder to be further deform than others, so that the instability will be removed, i.e. the materials have abilities to weaken the inhomogeneity before reaching <b>ultimate</b> <b>strain.</b> However, as the strain become larger, the work hardening rate will decreases, so that for now the region with smaller area is weaker than other region, therefore reduction in area will concentrate in this region and the neck becomes more and more pronounced until fracture. After the neck has formed in the materials, further plastic deformation is concentrated in the neck while the remainder of the material undergoes elastic contraction owing to the decrease in tensile force.|$|E

40|$|Combining a {{reasonable}} stiffness {{and a high}} <b>ultimate</b> failure <b>strain</b> in a single material is challenging task. Intralayer hybridisation of self-reinforced polypropylene (SRPP) with carbon fibre is proposed as a new strategy to increase stiffness while maintaining a high strain to failure. The bonding between SRPP and the carbon fibre prepregs {{was found to be}} a crucial parameter in these hybrids. It can be altered either directly by replacing the homopolymer polypropylene (PP) matrix in the prepregs by a maleic anhydride PP, or indirectly by changing the carbon fibre volume fraction. Weak bonding was key to preserving a high <b>ultimate</b> failure <b>strain</b> and impact resistance. Strong bonding reduced the <b>ultimate</b> failure <b>strain</b> and impact resistance, but improved flexural properties.

The {{reduction in the}} <b>ultimate</b> shrinkage <b>strain</b> with a higher polymer ratio was likely because continuous polymer films occupying micro-pores in the concrete hindered water evaporation (Su 1995; Persson 2001; Zhang and Kong 2014).

40|$|High- and normal-strength {{concretes}} {{have different}} stress-strain characteristics and therefore high-strength concrete beams {{should not be}} designed {{in the same way}} as normal-strength concrete beams. In this study, the non-linear flexural behaviour of high-strength concrete beams has been analysed and compared to that of normal-strength concrete beams. It was revealed that because of the gradual change in stress-strain characteristics of the concrete, the <b>ultimate</b> concrete <b>strain</b> varies significantly with the concrete grade. Moreover, the tension reinforcement does not always yield at the point of peak moment and thus the maximum compressive strain of the concrete when the tension reinforcement yields, which is needed for evaluation of the balanced steel ratio, is not the same as the <b>ultimate</b> concrete <b>strain.</b> Nevertheless, compromised values of <b>ultimate</b> concrete <b>strain</b> that can be used for evaluation of both flexural strength and balanced steel ratio without producing significant errors have been derived.

30|$|Both {{numerical}} formulations for stirrups show {{a similar}} structural response. The main {{difference is the}} magnitude of the vertical mid-span displacement at point D. The layerwise stirrup formulation predicts a slightly earlier failure than the formulation based on the constant out-of-plane strain assumption. This {{can be explained by the}} difference in the <b>ultimate</b> <b>strain</b> of the confined concrete layers (Fig.  12) as a result of different stress states in the models. At point D the in-plane transversal stress component gives close values in both stirrup formulations (in the order of some tenth of MPa to 1  MPa) but the out-of plane transversal stress is significantly higher in the constant out-of-plane strain (around 9.5 – 10  MPa) than in the layerwise formulation (some tenth of MPa). This is a natural outcome of the fact that in this formulation only the concrete layers in compression carry stresses that equilibrate the force generated in the out-of-plane direction by the steel stirrup. The result generally is a smaller effective area (and its evolution) over which concrete stresses can act in the z direction, compared to the layerwise formulation. Because of the nature of the considered concrete yield surface a higher value of the confining stress allows for the development of a higher axial stress. The increased capacity of the confined concrete layers to carry stress results in the development of a higher hydrostatic stress, which influences beneficially the <b>ultimate</b> <b>strain</b> of confined concrete. Considering the experimentally-inspired asymptotic nature of the increase in concrete <b>ultimate</b> <b>strain</b> as a function of the confining hydrostatic stress, the peak value of <b>ultimate</b> <b>strain</b> at point D remains close in both stirrup formulations, as shown in Fig.  12. On the other hand, this particular test was observed to be extremely sensitive to the <b>ultimate</b> <b>strain</b> in concrete, therefore even a small variation in its value is apparent in the load-displacement curves.|$|E
30|$|The {{vertical}} displacement at mid-span at structural failure matches best the experimental values with the constant out-of-plane strain stirrup formulation. The general trend {{is that a}} higher initial yield strength in concrete leads to a larger increase in the {{vertical displacement}} at failure (point D) when stirrups are considered, because the capacity to develop higher stresses in the material (both in the axial and transversal directions) influences beneficially the concrete <b>ultimate</b> <b>strain.</b> The reason why the vertical displacement at failure is close for 75 and 90  MPa concrete grades is that the initial <b>ultimate</b> <b>strain</b> in concrete was taken lower for the 90  MPa concrete (Table  2), based on the fit performed on the load-displacement curves without stirrups.|$|E

Adequate FRP confinement provides bilinear - like and hardening stress-strain behavior to concrete up to failure.
