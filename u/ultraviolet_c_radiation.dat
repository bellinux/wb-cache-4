The efficiency of these lenses in providing ocular protection against ultraviolet radiation was also examined. Eight lenses that are currently marketed in Malaysia as lenses with “UV-coating” were randomly selected for the testing. These lenses (Hoya, Essilor Orma, Optron, Sola, Igel, Zeiss, Vista Optics and American Optical) were obtained from a few optometric practices in Kuala Lumpur. They were marketed as lenses with "UV blocking" properties by virtue of the UV coat on them. A Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV- 160 A) was used to determine the spectral transmittance of these lenses. It was found that Hoya, Essilor, Optron, Sola and Igel lenses provided good protection against ultraviolet B radiation. However, there was transmission (10 to 15 %) of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>C</b> <b>radiation.</b> It was also found that these lenses transmitted some ultraviolet A radiation, averaging at about 28 % for all 5 lenses.

The study of lysogeny in various ecosystems is valuable to understanding microbial communities. Information on freshwater ecosystems is of particular importance, as lysogeny in marine systems is more widely studied This study examined the occurrence of lysogeny in a hypereutrophic, freshwater lake in Williamsburg, VA for the months of November and December 2009 and February and March 2010. Mitomycin C was added to ambient lake water and inductions were measured as the increase in viral direct counts from control sample counts using epifluorescence microscopy. March water samples were the only to demonstrate significant prophage induction. Burst size ranged from 0 to 98. 53 and lysogenic fractions ranged from 2. 67 % to 54. 50 %. No significant correlations were found between water quality data and biological data. Experiments were also carried out with different inducing agents on a lake water sample and E. coli (λ) lysogens, including mitomycin <b>C,</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation,</b> and an herbicide (SedgeHammer). Mitomycin C induced the most viruses in E. coli (λ), while the highest concentration of the herbicide induced the most viruses in the ambient lake water.

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{is caused}} by {{degeneration}} of the dopaminergic neurons; environmental toxicants are hypothesized {{to play a role}} in PD etiology. Environmental toxicants can cause mitochondrial dysfunction through mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and production of reactive oxygen species. Serial <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>C</b> (UVC) <b>radiation</b> causes an accumulation of mtDNA damage and 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) causes loss of dopaminergic neurons. Mitochondrial dynamics, or fusion and fission of the mitochondria, are important processes in mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction. The fzo- 1 and drp- 1 genes in Caenorhabditis elegans are orthologs for human Mfn 1 / 2 and Drp 1 and are involved in mitochondrial fusion and fission, respectively. I tested the hypothesis that deletion mutant strains for these two genes would show increased neurodegeneration after environmental damage, relative to the wild-type control strain, due to the lack of normal mitochondrial dynamics. Unexpectedly, both the fzo- 1 and drp- 1 were protected against 6 -OHDA-induced neurodegeneration relative to wild-type. The fzo- 1 knockout underwent complete larval arrest after UVC exposure, suggesting that mitochondrial fusion is necessary for recovery after mtDNA damage. The drp- 1 mutant showed slightly more neurodegeneration than wild-type after UVC exposure at the 10 J/m 2 dose, but not the 7. 5 J/m 2 dose. These results highlight the significance of mitochondrial dynamics and gene-environment interactions in dopaminergic neurodegeneration and PD etiology.

Loss of MMR has been correlated with resistance to a variety of DNA-damaging agents, including many anticancer drugs [2]. How loss of MMR leads to resistance is not understood, but is proposed to be due to loss of futile MMR activity and/or replication stalling [3, 4]. We report that inactivation of MMR genes (MLH 1, MLH 2, MSH 2, MSH 3, MSH 6, but not PMS 1) in isogenic strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae led to increased resistance to the anticancer drugs cisplatin, carboplatin and doxorubicin, but had no effect on sensitivity to <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>C</b> (UVC) <b>radiation.</b> Sensitivity to cisplatin and doxorubicin was increased in mlh 1 mutant strains when the MLH 1 gene was reintroduced, demonstrating a direct involvement of MMR proteins in sensitivity to these DNA-damaging agents.

We propose a model whereby MMR proteins – in addition to their role in DNA-damage recognition – decrease adduct tolerance during DNA replication by modulating the levels of recombination-dependent bypass. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that, in human ovarian tumour cells, loss of hMLH 1 correlated with acquisition of cisplatin resistance and increased cisplatin-induced sister chromatid exchange, both of which were reversed by restoration of hMLH 1 expression...|$|R

There was an indication of a photo-reactivation effect with T. putrescentiae. Limited penetrative ability through substrates was observed at the doses assessed. Complete prevention of spore germination and complete spore destruction of P. verrucosum was achieved at 20, 000 and 25, 000 μJ cm⁻² respectively.

Quality attributes such as total colour difference, firmness, pH and ascorbic and dehydroascorbic acid content were also evaluated. The treatments were applied before product storage under frozen conditions (− 7 and − 30 °C). Pre-washings with hydrogen peroxide solutions allowed obtaining frozen shred red bell peppers with lower microbial loads, {{when compared to the}} results obtained with the remaining treatments.

Morbidity and mortality due to MRSA infections continue to increase despite efforts to improve infection control measures and to develop new antibiotics. Therefore alternative antimicrobial strategies that do not give rise to development of resistance are urgently required. A group of therapeutic interventions has been developed in the field of photomedicine with the common theme that they rely on electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths between 200 and 1000 nm broadly called 2 ̆ 2 light 2 ̆ 2. These techniques all use simple absorption of photons by specific chromophores to deliver the killing blow to microbial cells while leaving the surrounding host mammalian cells relatively unharmed.

Methods Blood, saliva, semen, and DNA isolated from buccal swab samples were obtained from a single male donor and applied to the laboratory working surfaces. UVC radiation was applied to these diluted and undiluted samples with or without previous decontamination of the working surfaces with 10 % sodium hypochlorite and 20 % ethanol.

We tested and statistically analyzed DNA concentration, UVC dose, sample volume, radiation time, the number of correctly detected alleles on genetic loci, {{and the number of}} correctly detected alleles in four groups in which 16 loci were divided. Results When working surfaces were not decontaminated and were treated only with UVC radiation in the laboratory, the genetic profile for naked DNA could not be obtained after 2 minutes of UVC radiation and for saliva after 54 hours. For blood and semen, a partial genetic profile was obtained even after 250 hours of UVC radiation in the laminar.

Grapes are a major fruit crop and are grown {{in many parts of the}} world. Research has shown that UV-C irradiation induces the biosynthesis of phenols in grape leaves. However, few studies have analyzed the overall changes in gene expression in grape leaves exposed to UV-C. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, transcriptional responses were investigated in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) leaves before and after exposure to UV-C irradiation (6 W·m- 2 for 10 min) using an Affymetrix Vitis vinifera (Grape) Genome Array (15, 700 transcripts). A total of 5274 differentially expressed probe sets were defined, including 3564 (67. 58 %) probe sets that appeared at both 6 and 12 h after exposure to UV-C irradiation but not before exposure. A total of 468 (8. 87 %) probe sets and 1242 (23. 55 %) probe sets were specifically expressed at these times. The probe sets were associated with a large number of important traits and biological pathways, including cell rescue (i. e., antioxidant enzymes), protein fate (i. e., HSPs), primary and secondary metabolism, and transcription factors. Interestingly, some of the genes involved in secondary metabolism, such as stilbene synthase, responded intensely to irradiation. Some of the MYB and WRKY family transcription factors, such as VvMYBPA 1, VvMYB 14, VvMYB 4, WRKY 57 -like, and WRKY 65, were also strongly up-regulated (about 100 to 200 fold).

We have examined whether there are differences in cytotoxicity between partially ultraviolet-irradiated cells and uniformly irradiated cells after equal amounts of DNA damage were induced in the cell nuclei. We first determined DNA damage formation in normal human fibroblasts using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that 5 J per m 2 ultraviolet irradiation produced an equivalent amount of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and (6 – 4) photoproducts per cell as 100 J per m 2 with the membrane filter shield. At those doses, we found that both types of ultraviolet irradiation induced similar levels of cytotoxicity as assessed by a 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 5 -(3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl) - 2 -(4 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium assay. Both types of ultraviolet-irradiated cells also had similar cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis as measured by flow cytometry. Moreover, no significant differences in repair kinetics for either type of photolesion were observed between the two different ultraviolet treatments.

Mitochondria are the only organelles that contain their own genome which encodes for a small subset of electron transport chain (ETC) proteins {{as well as the}} necessary tRNAs and ribosomal subunits to translate these proteins. Over 300 pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations have been shown to cause a number of mitochondrial diseases emphasizing the importance of mtDNA maintenance and integrity to human health. Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction and mtDNA instability are linked to many wide-spread diseases associated with aging including cancer and neurodegeneration. Mitochondria lack the ability to repair certain helix-distorting lesions that are induced at high levels in mtDNA by important environmental genotoxins including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>C</b> <b>radiation</b> (UVC) and mycotoxins. These lesions are irreparable and persistent in the short term, but their long-term fate is unknown. Degradation of mitochondria and mtDNA is carried out by autophagy. Autophagy is protective against cell stress and apoptosis resulting from exposure to mitochondrial toxicants suggesting that it {{plays an important role in}} removal of unstable mitochondria that can serve as a source of ROS or initiate apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, dysfunctional mitochondria can be specifically targeted for degradation by the more specific process of mitophagy influenced in part by the processes of mitochondrial dynamics (i. e., fusion and fission). The goals of this dissertation were to investigate the long-term fate of helix-distorting mtDNA damage and determine the significance of autophagy and mitochondrial dynamics in removal of and recovery from persistent mtDNA damage. Removal of irreparable mtDNA damage and the necessity of autophagy, mitophagy, fusion and fission genes in removal of this damage were examined using genetic approaches in adult Caenorhabditis elegans. In order to investigate the significance of autophagy, fusion and fission genes in recovery from mtDNA damage-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo, an experimental method was developed to specifically induce persistent mtDNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction without persistent nDNA damage in developing C. elegans. Additionally, the effect of persistent helix-distorting DNA damage on mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial function and autophagy was investigated in C. elegans and in mammalian cell culture. The rate and specificity of mitochondrial degradation was further examined in cell culture using live-cell fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Removal of UVC-induced mtDNA damage was detectable by 72 hours in C. elegans and mammalian cell culture, and required mitochondrial fusion, fission and autophagy, providing genetic evidence for a novel mtDNA damage removal pathway. UVC exposure induced autophagy with no detectable effect on mitochondrial morphology in both systems; mitochondrial function was inhibited in the C. elegans system but not in the cell culture system in which the degree of mtDNA damage induced was less. Furthermore, mutations in genes involved in these processes as well as pharmacological inhibition of autophagy exacerbated mtDNA damage-mediated larval arrest, illustrating the in vivo relevance of removal of persistent mtDNA damage. Mutations in genes in these pathways exist in the human population, demonstrating the potential for important gene-environment interactions affecting mitochondrial health after genotoxin exposure.

40|$|Mitochondria are {{responsible}} for producing {{the vast majority of}} cellular ATP, and are therefore critical to organismal health [1]. They contain thir own genomes (mtDNA) which encode 13 proteins that are all subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) and are essential for oxidative phosphorylation [2]. mtDNA is present in multiple copies per cell, usually between 103 and 104, though this number is reduced during certain developmental stages [3, 4]. The health of the mitochondrial genome is also important {{to the health of the}} organism, as mutations in mtDNA lead to human diseases that collectively affect approximately 1 in 4000 people [5, 6]. mtDNA is more susceptible than nuclear DNA (nucDNA) to damage by many environmental pollutants, for reasons including the absence of Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) in the mitochondria [7]. NER is a highly functionally conserved DNA repair pathway that removes bulky, helix distorting lesions such as those caused by ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation and also many environmental toxicants, including benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) [8]. While these lesions cannot be repaired, they are slowly removed through a process that involves mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy [9, 10]. However, when present during development in C. elegans, this damage reduces mtDNA copy number and ATP levels [11]. We hypothesize that this damage, when present during development, will result in mitochondrial dysfunction and increase the potential for adverse outcomes later in life. To test this hypothesis, 1 st larval stage (L 1) C. elegans are exposed to 3 doses of 7. 5 J/m 2 <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>C</b> <b>radiation</b> 24 hours apart, leading to the accumulation of mtDNA damage [9, 11]. After exposure, many mitochondrial endpoints are assessed at multiple time points later in life. mtDNA and nucDNA damage levels and genome copy numbers are measured via QPCR and real-time PCR, respectively, every 2 day for 10 days. Steady state ATP levels are measured via luciferase expressing reporter strains and traditional ATP extraction methods. Oxygen consumption is measured using a Seahorse XFe 24 extra cellular flux analyzer. Gene expression changes are measured via real time PCR and targeted metabolomics via LC-MS are used to investigate changes in organic acid, amino acid and acyl-carnitine levels. Lastly, nematode developmental delay is assessed as growth, and measured via imaging and COPAS biosort. I have found that despite being removed, UVC induced mtDNA damage during development leads to persistent deficits in energy production later in life. mtDNA copy number is permanently reduced, as are ATP levels, though oxygen consumption is increased, indicating inefficient or uncoupled respiration. Metabolomic data and mutant sensitivity indicate a role for NADPH and oxidative stress in these results, and exposed nematodes are more sensitive to the mitochondrial poison rotenone later in life. These results fit with the developmental origin of health and disease hypothesis, and show the potential for environmental exposures to have lasting effects on mitochondrial function. Lastly, we are currently working to investigate the potential for irreparable mtDNA lesions to drive mutagenesis in mtDNA. Mutations in mtDNA lead to a wide range of diseases, yet we currently do not understand the environmental component of what causes them. In vitro evidence suggests that UVC induced thymine dimers can be mutagenic [12]. We are using duplex sequencing of C. elegans mtDNA to determine mutation rates in nematodes exposed to our serial UVC protocol. Furthermore, by including mutant strains deficient in mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, we hope to determine if deficiencies in these processes will further increase mtDNA mutation rates, as they are implicated in human diseases.

40|$|Nowadays, {{coffee beans}} are almost {{exclusively}} {{used for the}} preparation of the beverage. The sustainability of coffee production can be achieved introducing new applications for the valorization of coffee by-products. Coffee silverskin is the by-product generated during roasting, and because of its powerful antioxidant capacity, coffee silverskin aqueous extract (CSE) may be used for other applications, such as antiaging cosmetics and dermaceutics. This study aims to contribute to the coffee sector’s sustainability through the application of CSE to preserve skin health. Preclinical data regarding the antiaging properties of CSE employing human keratinocytes and Caenorhabditis elegans are collected during the present study. Accelerated aging was induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) in HaCaT cells and by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>C</b> (UVC) in C. elegans. Results suggest that the tested concentrations of coffee extracts were not cytotoxic, and CSE 1 mg/mL gave resistance to skin cells when oxidative damage was induced by t-BOOH. On the other hand, nematodes treated with CSE (1 mg/mL) showed a significant increased longevity compared to those cultured on a standard diet. In conclusion, our results support the antiaging properties of the CSE and its great potential for improving skin health due to its antioxidant character associated with phenols among other bioactive compounds present in the botanical material...|$|R
