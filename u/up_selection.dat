Lack of overview of sub-menus and menu items is a problem for marking menus and a solution called browse menus is proposed. The browse menus gives a preview of the next sub-menu or item before a selection is made and speeds <b>up</b> <b>selection.</b> Different ways of selecting sub-menus and commands were investigated and a combination of release button and exceed border were found to be the most efficient selection technique for both beginners and experts. The results conclude that marking menus with eight sectors, nested three levels deep is a promising alternative for complex haptic applications...|$|E

40|$|Biological {{explanations}} are given of three main uninterpreted theoretical {{results on the}} selection of altruism in inelastic viscous homogeneous populations, namely that non-overlapping generations hinder the evolution of altruism, fecundity effects are more conducive to altruism than survival effects, and one demographic regime (so-called death-birth) permits altruism whereas another (so-called birth-death) does not. The central idea is 'circles of compensation', which measure how far the effects of density dependence extend from a focal individual. Relatednesses can then be calculated that compensate for density dependence. There is very generally a 'balancing circle of compensation', at which the viscosity of the population slows <b>up</b> <b>selection</b> of altruism, but does not affect its direction, and this holds for altruism towards any individual, not just immediate neighbours. These {{explanations are}} possible because of recent advances {{in the theory of}} inclusive fitness on graphs. The assumption of node bitransitivity in that recent theory is relaxed to node transitivity and symmetry of the dispersal matrix, and new formulae show how to calculate relatedness from dispersal and vice versa...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Opportunistic {{selection}} aims {{to select}} a node that improves the overall system performance the most. Selection is challenging as the nodes are geographically distributed and have only local knowledge. Yet, selection needs to be fast in order to allocate more time to the data transmission phase that exploits the selected node’s services. In this paper, we analyze the impact of imperfect power control on a fast, distributed, splitting-based selection scheme that exploits the capture effect by allowing the transmitting nodes to have different target receive powers and uses information about the total received power to speed <b>up</b> <b>selection.</b> The scheme owes its speed {{to the use of}} different target powers that facilitate capture. However, imperfect power control makes the received power deviate from the target and, hence, affects performance. Our analysis quantifies how it changes the selection speed, leads to the selection of wrong node, or no node getting selected. We also quantify the effect of imperfect power control on the net system throughput and the extent of error beyond which power control is not useful. I...|$|E

Within existing academic libraries, which is my own area of interest and expertise, well-developed mechanisms {{are to be found}} for selecting print on paper materials. For digitisation to take its place in the Information world as a standard tool in the armoury of professionals, similar arrangements must exist in the electronic arena.

A recent JISC/NPO study into long-term archiving concluded that, for preservation, responsibility for drawing <b>up</b> <b>selection</b> guidelines could be assigned to a number of different agencies depending on the type of material under consideration. The basis for selection should be the permanent value of the data or product.

40|$|Flash memory affects {{not only}} storage options but also query processing. In this paper, we analyze {{the use of}} flash memory for {{database}} query processing, including algorithms that combine flash memory and traditional disk drives. We first focus on flash-resident databases and present data structures and algorithms that leverage the fast random reads of flash to speed <b>up</b> <b>selection,</b> projection, and join operations. FlashScan and FlashJoin are two such algorithms that leverage a column-based layout to significantly reduce memory and I/O requirements. Experiments with Postgres and an enterprise SSD drive show improved query runtimes by up to 6 x for queries ranging from simple relational scans and joins to full TPC-H queries. In {{the second part of}} the paper, we use external merge sort as a prototypical query execution algorithm to demonstrate that the most advantageous external sort algorithms combine flash memory and traditional disk, exploiting the fast access latency of flash memory as well as the fast transfer bandwidth and inexpensive capacity of traditional disks. Looking forward, database query processing in a three-level memory hierarchy of RAM, flash memory, and traditional disk can be generalized to any number of levels that future hardware may feature. ...|$|E
40|$|A strong {{association}} between {{the absence of the}} granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) protein for the 4 A chromosome of wheat and Japanese Udon noodle quality has been previously described. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify a molecular marker linked to the GBSS 4 A locus which could be used to identify wheat with the desired texture for Udon noodles. PCR primers were designed to target this gene which gave a 440 bp PCR band, corresponding to the presence or absence of the 4 A GBSS gene. Of the 268 genotypes screened with these primers, 267 were correctly identified using the PCR primers. The remaining genotype was shown to be heterogeneous for the marker. The PCR marker test developed has advantages over existing methods used to screen for Udon noodle starch quality as it enables high throughput, accurate tests to be carried out on leaves of young seedlings or mature seed and identify breeding lines that are heterogeneous for the 4 A allele which will allow for reselections. Application of this PCR test will speed <b>up</b> <b>selection</b> for Udon noodle quality genotypes and reduce breeding costs for production of noodle wheat varieties...|$|E
