500|$|In January 2009, Reubens {{hinted that}} {{negotiations}} were {{under way for}} his stage show to come back, and in August the return of The Pee-wee Herman Show was announced. Reubens said he felt Pee-wee calling, [...] "I just got <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> and felt like I'm gonna come back, that was it." [...] The show is also a way to [...] "introduce Pee-wee to the new generation that didn't know about it", preparing the way for Reubens' main project, the Playhouse movie. Before this comeback, Reubens' present age and shape had been pointed out as a possible issue, since Pee-wee's slim figure and clean skin {{have been one of}} his trademarks. But after appearing {{for the first time since}} 1992 as Pee-wee at Spike TV's 2007 Guys' Choice Awards, Reubens had remained optimistic and had jokingly said he's no longer nervous about being young Pee-wee again thanks to digital retouching.|$|E
500|$|Templar Frank Mooney: [...] "They showed <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> him [...] {{and another}} fella. [...] Ten, twelve years ago.

500|$|The Dodgers {{entered the}} game with an 83–60 record and a 6.5-game lead in the NL West over the Astros, while the Atlanta Braves were 34 games back in 6th place in the {{division}} with a 49–94 record entering the game. With Hershiser's September 14 win, the Dodgers maintained a 6.5-game lead. Hershiser's record on the season against the Braves was 5–0 with a 1.29 ERA. The game marked only {{the third time in}} 1988 that he pitched on three days rest. Lasorda and Perranoski moved Hershiser's start <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> because they wanted him to pitch the next week against the second-place Houston Astros. [...] With the streak at 31 innings Hershiser tied Jackson in number of wins, and moved into a tie for the sixth longest scoreless streak for the franchise since the 1958 relocation to Los Angeles. Although Drysdale's record was mentioned after he reached 31 consecutive innings, the focus of the media was on the Cy Young Award race with Jackson. The win was Hershiser's seventh consecutive against the Braves, a streak that began on September 13, 1987.|$|E

2500|$|Rostam Batmanglij was a prior fan of Jepsen's {{work when}} {{he reached out to}} her in the summer of 2014, after {{learning}} that she was in Los Angeles writing with various people. Jepsen was [...] "over the moon" [...] and the pair developed [...] "Warm Blood" [...] until March 2015, the first verse recorded as Jepsen sat on the carpet of Batmanglij's home studio. Batmanglij announced the track's existence via Twitter on April 29, 2015. The song has been noted for its experimental vocal effects, with Batmanglij scattering distorted vocal cuts throughout, a [...] "creepy" [...] quality that the pair immediately liked. Elsewhere, sections of [...] "Warm Blood" [...] were sung in a lower pitch: [...] "I had shown <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> and my voice was a little shot. The idea was that I would come back and sing it 'properly' once I’d recovered, but we ended up getting married to how it sounded since my voice was kind of smokier, so we kept it."

2500|$|The {{second part}} is finding e, the {{additional}} offset days {{that must be}} added to the date offset d to make it arrive at a Sunday. Since the week has 7 days, the offset must be in the range 0 to 6 and determined by modulo 7 arithmetic. e is determined by calculating [...] These constants may seem strange at first, but are quite easily explainable if we remember that we operate under mod 7 arithmetic. To begin with, [...] ensures that we take care of the fact that weekdays slide for each year. A normal year has 365 days, but , so 52 full weeks make <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> too little. Hence, each consecutive year, the weekday [...] "slides one day forward", meaning if May 6 was a Wednesday one year, it is a Thursday the following year (disregarding leap years). Both b and c increases by one for an advancement of one year (disregarding modulo effects). The expression [...] thus increases by 6—but remember that this is the same as subtracting 1 mod 7. And to subtract by 1 is exactly what is required for a normal year – since the weekday slips one day forward we should compensate one day less to arrive at the correct weekday (i.e. Sunday). For a leap year, b becomes 0 and 2b thus is 0 instead of 8—which under mod 7, is another subtraction by 1—i.e., a total subtraction by 2, as the weekdays after the leap day that year slides forward by two days.|$|E

The track has been compared to songs by Lily Allen, Goldfrapp and Kylie Minogue. The next track is a cover of The Korgis' [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime". Roberts explained the inclusion of the track on the album saying [...] "The lyrics mean a lot to me. I identified with the song in general. It might not be powerful to everybody, but it's powerful to me. I wanted to do it, I love the song." [...] The cover is preceded by the song [...] "Say It Out Loud", which has gathered comparisons to Katy Perry, and is a high-energy pop song featuring [...] "Crystal Castles-ish 8-bit bleeps here and there" [...] and a chorus with a [...] "big old fuzzy hollering rush". [...] "Gladiator", the ninth track, {{has been described}} as a Berlin-style dance track. The disco track hears Roberts perform [...] "girly" [...] vocals, with comparisons to Teena Marie and Heartbreak, whilst the following song [...] "Fish Out of Water" [...] garnerered comparisons to Metronomy.

Roberts explained the concept of the track, noting [...] "What it is with Sticks + Stones is I wanted all the people out there who hurt like that to know that they’re not the only ones in that position. Sometimes there's so many people in the world suffering from the same thing or hurting from the same thing, but they feel like they’re on their own. I wanted a song that could highlight the subject so it was like, actually I’m so not on my own here."
