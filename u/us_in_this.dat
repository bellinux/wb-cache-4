25|$|Modern {{social theory}} {{contains}} {{a tension between}} the realization of human freedom {{and the necessity of}} social rules. Liberal political theorists of the seventeenth century, such as Hobbes and Locke, saw the issue as one of sacrificing some individual freedoms in order to gain others. They understood social rules as enabling constraints—necessary impositions that limited activity in some spheres in order to expand it in others. (For example, traffic laws compel us to drive {{on one side of the}} road but allow us to travel more freely than if we were constantly assailed by oncoming traffic.) In the socio-political realm, these early liberal thinkers argued that we agree to surrender our freedom for political authority in order to gain greater freedom from a state of nature. The sovereign authority is a constraint, but it allows freedom from the constraints that other individuals might impose upon <b>us.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> way, rules are always seen as a means of increasing freedom rather than rescinding it.|$|E

We [...] are not a military organisation; we have only been vociferous in our views—views concerning everything from the government's foreign policy in Iraq and Afghanistan to the host of draconian laws, which they’ve introduced against <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country." ...|$|E

But his love for music and my love for baseball bonded <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> project." [...] Sports blogger Voodoo Brown described West as [...] "in creepmode from the gate." [...] Sportswriter Doug Miller said that the album was [...] "a fun, humorous and often touching collection of spoken-word gems in which the listener gets a perfect sampling of the true personality of Cowboy Joe West." ...|$|E

Upon general release in 1955, the film formed {{one half of the}} highest grossing double bill in the UK. It was the first Hammer production {{to attract the attention of}} a major distributor in the <b>US,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case United Artists, who distributed the film under the title The Creeping Unknown. Its success led to Hammer producing an increasing number of horror films, including two sequels Quatermass 2 (1957) and Quatermass and the Pit (1967), making them synonymous with the genre. The Quatermass Xperiment is regarded as the first of these [...] "Hammer Horrors".|$|E

Gerrard was unrepentant for tackling Vieira and stated {{he was trying to}} [...] "stamp [...] authority" [...] on the match. [...] He accepted defeat and was optimistic Liverpool had the means to win the Premier League: [...] "We'd rather they beat <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> game and then we go on to pick up the title. That's what we're really looking at. Even though they got the better of us yesterday, it doesn't mean they'll do better than us over the whole season." [...] Diouf insisted he should have earned a penalty in the second half, given he felt there was [...] "definite contact" [...] from a challenge in the penalty box: [...] "It was a penalty, definitely, but the referee is the master on the pitch and he didn't give it. I know the Arsenal players think I dived, but I didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Wennersten {{contacted}} Sparks when Jasenko Selimovic, {{the head}} of SR Radioteatern, decided that the station would produce {{a number of new}} musicals. She thought Sparks would be suitable for the format: [...] "They are a bit extravagant; they have a larger-than-life quality, and above all, they make music that is colourful enough for it not to feel like you miss a visual component." [...] Sparks were initially somewhat surprised by the invitation to write a musical for Swedish radio, and were hesitant to take on the project. However, after several months of persuasive effort from Wennersten, via e-mail and telephone, they decided to accept the challenge. [...] "We originally thought of it as a side project between albums, but once we started working on it, it took on a bigger life," [...] Sparks have said. [...] "As Americans we have almost abandoned radio drama and it was truly exhilarating for us to work in a medium where the imagination of the listener is so integral a part of the work. Aside from our love of Bergman, we have a love of Orson Welles and his use of the medium of radio was something that inspired <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> work." ...|$|E

500|$|Arsenal played league challengers Newcastle United in {{the sixth}} round, on 9 March 2002. The timing of the game, {{influenced}} by the television schedulers, angered Wenger, who threatened to field a weakened side, to prioritise on their Champions League progress: [...] "The BBC have put <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> position of playing at 5.35pm on Saturday night instead of a noon kick-off. I don't know whether Newcastle would have played the game earlier on the Saturday but what can I do about the BBC? I feel it's being very unfair as {{we are the only}} side left in all three competitions." [...] It was the second meeting between both teams in a week, and in spite of Arsenal winning the first fixture and scoring the opener in the cup tie, Newcastle found [...] "new reserves of energy and determination" [...] to draw level and created numerous opportunities to win the game outright. With the game ending in a draw, a replay was scheduled two weeks later. Arsenal won 3-0, but more concerningly lost Pirès, who was carried off and subsequently ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} season with medial knee ligament damage. An own goal by Middlesbrough's Gianluca Festa, from an Henry free-kick in the semi-finals was enough to send Arsenal to their 15th FA Cup final.|$|E

His first infomercial was aired on October 6, and viewed by 16.5 million people. He used two dozen charts and a metal pointer during the ad, explaining that [...] "We got into trickle-down economics and it didn't trickle." [...] He later concluded that [...] "our President blames Congress, Congress blames the President, the Democrats and Republicans blame each other. Nobody {{steps up to the}} plate and accepts responsibility for anything." [...] He spent a large portion of the infomercial speaking into the camera while sitting at a desk in front of a bookshelf. Political experts commented that the nature of the ad was groundbreaking. Two days later, an ad campaign was unveiled that included three new 60-second commercials to air on ESPN, CNN and five other cable networks. One commercial entitled [...] "Red Flag" [...] displayed a waving red flag with a background drum roll and the statement: [...] "While the Cold War is ending another war is upon <b>us.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> new war, the enemy is not the red flag of Communism, but the red ink of our national debt, the red tape of our government bureaucracy. The casualties of this war are counted in lost jobs and lost dreams." [...] A second half hour infomercial was shown on October 9.|$|E
500|$|Negotiations {{over the}} fate of the ships were under way at the Paris Peace Conference. The French and Italians each wanted a quarter of the ships. The British wanted them destroyed, since they knew that any {{redistribution}} would be detrimental to the proportional advantage in numbers they had compared to other navies. Under Article XXXI of the Armistice the Germans were not permitted to destroy their ships. Both Admirals Beatty and Madden had approved plans to seize the German ships in case scuttling was attempted; Admirals Keyes and Leveson recommended that the ships be seized anyway and the crews interned ashore at Nigg Island, but their suggestions were not taken up. Their concern was not without justification, for as early as January 1919, von Reuter mentioned the possibility of scuttling the fleet to his chief of staff. Having learned of the possible terms of the Treaty of Versailles in May 1919, he began to prepare detailed plans to scuttle his ships. Admiral Erich Raeder later wrote that von Reuter was informed that the fleet was to be scuttled at all costs. A further reduction of crews with the departure of two transports to Germany on 18 June 1919 meant that von Reuter was left with reliable men to carry out preparations. On that day he sent out orders, paragraph 11 of which stated: [...] "It is my intention to sink the ships only if the enemy should attempt to obtain possession of them without the assent of our government. Should our government agree in the peace to terms to the surrender of the ships, then the ships will be handed over, to the lasting disgrace of those who have placed <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> position." [...] His orders were sent to the interned ships on 18 June.|$|E

[...] Much of the fence was sold to a West German scrap-metal company at the rate of about $4 per segment.
