Recent experience with regulatory regimes, such as wetland and conservation banking in the USA, tradable forest conservation obligations in Brazil and habitat compensation requirements in Australia, Canada and the EU, has been supplemented by growing interest in the potential of voluntary biodiversity offsets. This experience suggests that biodiversity offsets may be of value to business, government, local communities and conservation [...] ...|$|E
40|$|South Africa {{is one of}} {{the most}} biologically diverse {{countries}} in the world. This biodiversity is under threat from economic, social and climate change pressures. One mechanism that could be added to South Africa's conservation tools, is that of the biodiversity offset where certain activities are designed to compensate for <b>unavoidable</b> <b>harm</b> to biodiversity resulting from development. The concept and theory of offsetting is controversial however, and not all commentators are in favour of encouraging a formal biodiversity offsetting regime in South Africa. This dissertation will explore the concept of biodiversity offsets in the regulatory permitting context and the controversies implicit in their theory and implementation. A framework for their inclusion in South Africa's environmental permitting context will be suggested...|$|E

40|$|Background: Within {{affluent}} populations, {{there are}} marked socioeconomic gradients in health behavior, {{with people of}} lower socioeconomic position smoking more, exercising less, having poorer diets, complying less well with therapy, using medical services less, ignoring health and safety advice more, and being less health-conscious overall, than their more affluent peers. Whilst the proximate mechanisms underlying these behavioral differences have been investigated, the ultimate causes have not. Methodology/Principal Findings: This paper presents a theoretical model of why socioeconomic gradients in health behavior might be found. I conjecture that lower socioeconomic position is associated with greater exposure to extrinsic mortality risks (that is, risks that cannot be mitigated through behavior), and that health behavior competes for people’s time and energy against other activities which contribute to their fitness. Under these two assumptions, the model shows that the optimal amount of health behavior to perform is indeed less for people of lower socioeconomic position. Conclusions/Significance: The model predicts an exacerbatory dynamic of poverty, whereby the greater exposure of poor people to <b>unavoidable</b> <b>harms</b> engenders a disinvestment in health behavior, resulting in a final inequality in health outcomes which {{is greater than the}} initial inequality in material conditions. I discuss the assumptions of the model, and it...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{will examine}} how the framing of ‘trolley problems’ {{incorrectly}} motivates arithmetic rankings of states of affairs by removing context. This is problematic because the context of these problems provides the tools to solve moral dilemmas by allowing one to analyze the relevant motivations, moral implications, duties, values, and personal and societal obligations that one has. I will discuss Samuel Scheffler’s charge that a paradox exists within agent-centered restrictions and how his abstract paradigmatic case leads to arithmetic rankings of choices, which are both unrealistic and lead to tragic and morally unacceptable decision making. I will argue that Allen Wood’s Middle Theory can help dispel the apparent paradox and demonstrate {{a better way to}} examine ‘trolley problems’. I will further discuss how Martha Nussbaum’s analysis of tragic questions illuminates the issues surrounding such problems providing a morally acceptable way to account for the occasional <b>unavoidable</b> <b>harm</b> that results in decision-making caused by solving ‘trolley problems. ’ Taken together, Wood’s and Nussbaum’s theories and analysis provide potential solutions to ‘trolley problems. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, {{debate on}} the quality and safety of {{healthcare}} {{has been dominated by}} a measure and manage administrative rationality. More recently, this rationality has been overlaid by ideas from human factors, ergonomics and systems engineering. Little critical attention has been given in the nursing literature to how risk of harm is understood and actioned, or how patients can be subjectified and marginalised through these discourses. The problem of assuring safety for particular patient groups, and the dominance of technical forms of rationality, has seen the word ‘unavoidable’ used in connection with intractable forms of patient harm. Employing pressure injury policy as an exemplar, and critically reviewing notions of risk and <b>unavoidable</b> <b>harm,</b> we problematise the concept of unavoidable patient harm, highlighting how this dominant safety rationality risks perverse and taken-for-granted assumptions about patients, care processes and the nature of risk and harm. In this orthodoxy, those who specify or measure risk are positioned as having more insight into the nature of risk, compared to those who simply experience risk. Driven almost exclusively as a technical and administrative pursuit, the patient safety agenda risks decentring the focus from patients and patient care...|$|E
40|$|Biodiversity offsets {{are part}} of a new suite of {{biodiversity}} conservation instruments designed to mitigate the impacts of economic developments on species, habitats and ecosystems. Led by an international collaboration of representatives from companies, financial institutions, governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the Business and Biodiversity Offsets Programme (BBOP) of the market-oriented Forest Trends group, has created a global framework through which principles and standards for biodiversity offsets are being established. These enable the apparently <b>unavoidable</b> <b>harm</b> caused by development to be exchanged for investment in conservation activities both at different geographical locations and in the future. Offsets can also be traded via bespoke markets for environmental conservation indicators. Given a globalizing ‘green economy’ discourse that conservation can be a profitable enterprise if guided by market-based mechanisms and the entwining of ecological with economic spheres, biodiversity offsets are becoming key to current entrepreneurial interest in biodiversity conservation. The ‘green rush’ of my title refers to both this interest in conservation activities that can be marketized, and to an associated appetite in business and financial sectors for incorporating biodiversity offsets as part of a strategy for ‘greening’ the environmental harm caused by developments. I illustrate the uses to which biodiversity offsets are being put, through a case study connecting the extraction of uranium in Namibia for the generation of nuclear power in the UK. Biodiversity offsets are invoked to satisfy requirements for off-site mitigation of environmental harm at points of both extraction and ‘consumption’ of uranium in this case. I highlight some of the (anti-) ecological assumptions guiding calculations of complex ecological assemblages so that they can become biodiversity offsets, and draw attention to the intensified distributions of new environmental values with which biodiversity offsets may be associated...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{points out}} a simple flaw common to many law-and-economics analyses, ranging from {{fundamental}} models like the Hand Formula to narrower arguments like those that oppose the doctrine of unconscionability. The flaw is straightforward: economic analyses of law often assume, either implicitly or explicitly that when it is more efficient for an activity to occur than for it not to occur it is efficient for legal rules to encourage the activity. Even on grounds of efficiency alone, however, knowing in isolation whether an activity produces more wealth than its absence is insufficient {{to conclude that the}} activity is efficient. The determination of efficient legal rules requires an answer to a further question too often neglected by legal economists: what are the activity 2 ̆ 7 s alternatives? Even if an activity is more efficient than its absence, it may produce less wealth (perhaps significantly less wealth) than its alternatives, once its harms are taken into account. Encouraging all activities that appear to produce wealth on their own runs the risk of encouraging opportunistic behavior whose effect is more to transfer wealth than to create it. As a simple example, a legal regime that followed the Hand Formula would encourage businesses to earn 100, 000 by causing 95, 000 worth of <b>unavoidable</b> <b>harms</b> to others; that incentive alone, while probably objectionable for other reasons, is not inefficient because, instrumentally speaking, the 100, 000 social gains justify the 95, 000 social losses. But a rule based on the Hand Formula would also encourage economic actors to engage in that 100, 000 -earning activity rather than one that paid 90, 000 but caused no harms; that incentive is inefficient. Some economic analyses acknowledge related points, but the law-and-economics movement insufficiently understands the flaw that this Article describes. Similarly critics of the law-and-economics movement [...] while aware of other fundamental flaws in legal-economic analysis, such as the inapplicability of the rational-actor model in many circumstances [...] do not readily enough engage economic models on their own terms. This Article attempts to remedy those oversights, and in doing so, it suggests greater caution in applying economic reasoning to law...|$|R
3000|$|First, {{we assumed}} {{that there is a}} [...] "standard concept of death." [...] However, we {{included}} in the survey all the concepts offered in the literature and also provided an opportunity to provide a new concept in the open-ended question. Although we found that most neurologists did not agree with the concept of loss of integrative unity, the main alternative was a higher brain concept. This would imply that patients with permanent vegetative state are dead in their state of wakefulness and breathing. Second, perhaps the finding that 97 % of neurologists are comfortable diagnosing death based on BD only shows that neurologists are not able to justify explicitly why the equivalency truly holds. After all, this is a philosophical question and may not involve terminology used in clinical training. Perhaps the main finding of the survey is uncovering an unmet neurologists' educational need. Although a potential interpretation, this may not be reassuring to families who are told that their loved one is dead based on the criterion BD. In addition, the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology lists an understanding of BD on the objectives of training [20]. Third, although the survey did not determine this, perhaps neurologists accept BD as [...] "dead enough" [...] for organ donation and withdrawal of life-support purposes. Accordingly, patients with BD should be allowed to die or should be treated as if they no longer are part of the human moral community; but, this is different than being biologically dead. We agree with other authors who have suggested that if BD is not death, whether BD can be considered a state where vital organ donation complies with nonmaleficence (death is an <b>unavoidable</b> and minimal <b>harm)</b> and autonomy (with informed consent) requires further discussion and debate [21].|$|R
