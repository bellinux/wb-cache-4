Shortly afterwards, he was offered an appointment as Government Naturalist to the soon-to-be-established Swan River Colony (Australia). This position was honorary, but Drummond was given to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it was decided to establish a public garden in the colony, he could expect to be given a salaried appointment as Superintendent of Government Gardens.|$|E
500|$|However, {{many other}} types of animals {{have been shown to}} have the ability for object {{permanence}}. These include dogs, cats, and a few species of birds such as the carrion crow, Eurasian jays and food-storing magpies. [...] Dogs are able to reach a level of object permanence that allows them to find food after it has been hidden beneath one of two cups and rotated 90°. [...] Similarly, cats are able to understand object permanence but not to the same extent that dogs can. Cats fail to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they see something go into an apparatus in one direction that it will still be there if the cat tries to enter from another direction. However, while cats {{did not seem to be}} quite as good at this ‘invisible displacement test’ as dogs are, it’s hard to say whether their poorer performance is a true reflection of their abilities or just due to the way in which they’ve been tested. A longitudinal study found that carrion crows' ability developed gradually, albeit with slight changes in the order of mastery compared to human infants. There was only one task, task 15, that the crows were not able to master. The crows showed perseverative searches at a previously rewarded location (the so-called ‘A-not-B error’). They mastered visible rotational displacements consistently, but failed at more complex invisible rotational displacements. [...] Another study tested the comparison of how long it took food-storing magpies to develop the object permanence necessary for them to be able to live independently. [...] The research suggests that these magpies followed a very similar pattern as human infants while they were developing.|$|E

He claimed that failure to join the euro would lead to the destruction of the British manufacturing base and said: [...] "It {{does not mean that the}} jobs will go tomorrow but will drift abroad over a period and the longer-term future of Britain as a manufacturing nation will be blighted.

[...] As late as 25 February 2003, it was still the official line that the only cause of invasion would be a failure to disarm. As Blair made clear in a statement to the House of Commons, [...] "I detest his regime. But even now he can save it by complying with the UN's demand. Even now, we are prepared to go the extra step to achieve disarmament peacefully." ...|$|E

Sullivan returned to London, and, as April wore on, Gilbert tried to rewrite his plot, but he could not satisfy Sullivan. The parties were at a stalemate, and Gilbert wrote, [...] "And so ends a musical & literary association of seven years' standing – an association of exceptional reputation – an association unequalled in its monetary results, and hitherto undisturbed by a single jarring or discordant element." [...] However, by 8 May 1884, Gilbert was ready to back down, writing, [...] "...am I to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I construct another plot in which no supernatural element occurs, you will undertake to set it? ... a consistent plot, free from anachronisms, constructed in perfect good faith & {{to the best of my}} ability."

2500|$|Monk had {{disappeared}} from the scene by the mid-1970s and made {{only a small number}} of appearances during the final decade of his life. His last studio recordings as a leader were made in November 1971 for the English Black Lion label, near the end of a worldwide tour with the Giants of Jazz, a group which included Gillespie, Kai Winding, Sonny Stitt, Al McKibbon, and Blakey. Bassist McKibbon, who had known Monk for over twenty years and played on his final tour in 1971, later said: [...] "On that tour, Monk said about two words. I mean literally maybe two words. He didn't say 'Good morning,' 'Goodnight,' 'What time?' Nothing. Why, I don't know. He sent word back after the tour was over that the reason he couldn't communicate or play was that Art Blakey and I were so ugly." [...] A different side of Monk is revealed in Lewis Porter's biography, John Coltrane: His Life and Music; Coltrane states: [...] "Monk is exactly the opposite of Miles : he talks about music all the time, and he wants so much for you to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>if,</b> by chance, you ask him something, he'll spend hours if necessary to explain it to you." [...] Blakey reports that Monk was excellent at both chess and checkers.|$|E

[...] The stalemate was broken, and on 20 May, Gilbert sent Sullivan a sketch of the plot to The Mikado. It would take another ten months for The Mikado to reach the stage. A revised version of their 1877 work, The Sorcerer, coupled with their one-act piece Trial by Jury (1875), played at the Savoy while Carte and their audiences awaited their next work. Gilbert eventually found a place for his [...] "lozenge plot" [...] in The Mountebanks, written with Alfred Cellier in 1892.|$|E
