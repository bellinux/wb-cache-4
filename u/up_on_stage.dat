25|$|By this time, the Stooges, {{with the}} notable {{exception}} of Ron Asheton, had all become serious heroin users. The drug {{was introduced to the}} band by new manager John Adams. Their performances became even more unpredictable, and Pop often had trouble standing <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>stage</b> due to his extreme drug abuse. Elektra soon eliminated the Stooges from its roster, and the band had a hiatus for several months. The final line-up was Pop, the Asheton brothers, Recca and Williamson.|$|E

25|$|As {{the role}} of the {{orchestra}} and other instrumental ensembles changed over the history of opera, so did {{the role of}} leading the musicians. In the Baroque era, the musicians were usually directed by the harpsichord player, although the French composer Lully is known to have conducted with a long staff. In the 1800s, during the Classical period, the first violinist, also known as the concertmaster, would lead the orchestra while sitting. Over time, some directors began to stand up and use hand and arm gestures to lead the performers. Eventually this role of music director became termed the conductor, and a podium was used {{to make it easier for}} all the musicians to see him or her. By the time Wagnerian operas were introduced, the complexity of the works and the huge orchestras used to play them gave the conductor an increasingly important role. Modern opera conductors have a challenging role: they have to direct both the orchestra in the orchestra pit and the singers <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E

At the 1998 Grammy Awards, he protested the Clan's loss (to Puff Daddy in Best Rap Album) by {{interrupting}} Shawn Colvin's acceptance speech for her Song of the Year award. In addition, ODB's run-ins with the law were well publicized—he was arrested several times for offenses including assault, shoplifting, wearing body armor after being convicted of a felony, and possession of cocaine, and he missed multiple court dates. In late 2000, Ol' Dirty Bastard unexpectedly escaped {{near the end of}} his rehab sentence, spending one month on the run as a fugitive before showing <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>stage</b> at the record release party for The W in New York City. He managed to escape the club but was later captured by police in Philadelphia and sent to New York to face charges of cocaine possession. In April 2001, he was sentenced to two to four years in prison. Once released from prison, he signed a one million dollar contract with Roc-a-Fella Records.|$|E

25|$|In 1954, Ellis began {{teaching}} his new techniques to other therapists, and by 1957, he formally set forth the first cognitive behavior therapy by proposing that therapists help people adjust their thinking and behavior as {{the treatment for}} emotional and behavioral problems. Two years later, Ellis published How to Live with a Neurotic, which elaborated on his new method. In 1960, Ellis presented a paper on his new approach at the American Psychological Association (APA) convention in Chicago. There was mild interest, but few recognized that the paradigm set forth would become the zeitgeist within a generation. At that time, the prevailing interest in experimental psychology was behaviorism, while in clinical psychology it was the psychoanalytic schools of notables such as Freud, Jung, Adler, and Perls. Despite the fact that Ellis' approach emphasized cognitive, emotive, and behavioral methods, his strong cognitive emphasis provoked the psychotherapeutic establishment {{with the possible exception}} of the followers of Adler. Consequently, he was often received with significant hostility at professional conferences and in print. He regularly held seminars where he would bring a participant <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>stage</b> and treat them. His own therapeutical style was famed for often being delivered in a rough, confrontational style; however, it should not be confused with his rational-emotive and cognitive-behavioral therapy school that is practiced by his students and followers in a large variety of therapeutic styles (e.g., often depending on client's personality, client's clinical problem, and evidence-based information regarding the appropriate intervention, but also including therapist's own preference).|$|E

500|$|Early guitar-based {{punk rock}} {{that came to}} {{prominence}} in the period 1976–77 was initially hostile to the [...] "inauthentic" [...] sound of the synthesizer, but many new wave and post-punk bands {{that emerged from the}} movement began to adopt it as a major part of their sound. British punk and New wave clubs were open to what was then considered an [...] "alternative" [...] sound. The do it yourself attitude of punk broke down the progressive rock era's norm of needing years of experience before getting <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>stage</b> to play synthesizers. The American duo Suicide, who arose from the post-punk scene in New York, utilised drum machines and synthesizers in a hybrid between electronics and post-punk on their eponymous 1977 album.|$|E
500|$|Evans enjoyed an {{executive}} position at Apple until 1969, when Allen Klein {{was hired as}} a manager to reorganise the whole company. Evans was fired by Klein the next year, because Klein complained to Lennon that Aspinall and Evans were [...] "living like kings; like fucking emperors". Evans was later reinstated after McCartney, Harrison and Starr complained. On 13 September 1969, Evans accompanied Lennon, Yoko Ono, Klaus Voorman, Alan White and Eric Clapton to Toronto, Canada, for the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival concert. He later wrote: [...] "I was really enjoying myself. It was the first show I had roadied for three years and I was really loving every minute of plugging the amps in and setting them <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>stage,</b> making sure that everything was right. Everyone wanted the show to go particularly well because Allen Klein, who had flown over, had organised for the whole of John's performance to be filmed.

[...] In February 2010, {{after the release of}} the song, Stephen attended one of the singer's concerts.

It was the second time the actor had appeared in the play, the first being back in Bristol fifty years previously when he starred as the youthful lead, Valentine. This time he was cast as William, the elderly waiter, a part which he considered to be [...] "a real hell to play", partly because of the many meals he had to serve <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>stage,</b> whilst at the same time trying to remember the complex script. [...] He enjoyed the play immensely and was thrilled at its successful run.

Hordern admitted that, on the whole, the experience made him feel [...] "a little happier" [...] about life.|$|E

In late 1970, the London Symphony Orchestra invited Shankar to compose a concerto with sitar. Concerto for Sitar & Orchestra was performed with André Previn as conductor and Shankar playing the sitar. Shankar performed at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971, held at Madison Square Garden in New York. After the musicians had tuned <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>stage</b> for over a minute, the crowd of rock-music fans broke into applause, to which the amused Shankar responded: [...] "If you like our tuning so much, I hope you will enjoy the playing more." [...] Although interest in Indian music had decreased in the early 1970s, the live album from the concert became one of the best-selling recordings to feature the genre and won Shankar a second Grammy Award.|$|E
