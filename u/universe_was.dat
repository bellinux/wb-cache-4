5|$|After these annihilations, the {{remaining}} protons, neutrons and electrons {{were no longer}} moving relativistically and the energy density of the <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> dominated by photons (with a minor contribution from neutrinos).|$|E
5|$|From {{approximately}} 10−6 {{seconds after}} the Big Bang, during a period {{is known as the}} hadron epoch, the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of the <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> dominated by hadrons. Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and antimatter in thermal equilibrium. However, as the temperature of the Universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle annihilation reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> about one second old.|$|E

5|$|The lepton epoch was {{the period}} in the {{evolution}} of the early Universe in which the leptons dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1 second after the Big Bang, after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the hadron epoch. During the lepton epoch the temperature of the <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created. Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons. The mass of the <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> then dominated by photons as it entered the following photon epoch.|$|E
5|$|The quark–gluon plasma {{would be}} {{characterized}} by a great {{increase in the number}} of heavier quark pairs in relation to the number of up and down quark pairs.

500|$|With the {{assumption}} of the cosmological principle that the <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> homogeneous and isotropic everywhere, a specific solution of the field equations that describes the <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> the metric tensor called the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric, ...|$|R
5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent {{of the value of}} the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant. Such a duality is interesting from the point of view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the distant future.|$|E
5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation {{is known as the}} cosmic microwave background radiation. The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> only 10–17 million years old.|$|E
5|$|F-Zero GX is {{the first}} F-Zero game to feature a Story mode.

Each chapter can be completed on a normal, hard, and very hard difficulty setting. Toshihiro Nagoshi, one of the game's co-producers, stated that this mode was included because the development team felt that the F-Zero <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> unique and they wanted to explain some of the characters' motivations and flesh out the game world.|$|E

5|$|Fantastic <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> a U.S. {{science fiction}} {{magazine}} which began publishing in the 1950s.

The main editors were Leo Margulies (1954–1956) and Hans Stefan Santesson (1956–1960); under Santesson's tenure the quality declined somewhat, and the magazine became known for printing much UFO-related material. A collection of stories from the magazine, edited by Santesson, appeared in 1960 from Prentice-Hall, titled The Fantastic Universe Omnibus.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} {{general theory of}} {{relativity}} to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E
