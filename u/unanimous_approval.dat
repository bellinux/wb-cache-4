Walker, Jr. Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, led by a friendly Democratic majority, went smoothly for her in June 1992, with her pro bono activities winning praise from Senator Ted Kennedy and her getting <b>unanimous</b> <b>approval</b> from the committee.

Part of the army, led by Dom Álvaro de Macedo (later Count of Ilha da Madeira), entrenched itself in Montevideo and remained loyal to Portugal. The town was besieged by forces under Laguna. Following his return from the imperial capital, Marques de Sousa served under his father's command, {{taking part in the}} siege and later fighting in the successful Battle of Las Piedras on 18 May 1823. In early 1824, Macedo and his men surrendered. The end of the Brazilian War of Independence came at a cost for Marques de Sousa. His father was mysteriously murdered with poison in Montevideo on 21 November 1824, leaving him the head of his family at age 20, as his paternal grandfather had died (of old age) on 22 April 1822.

Crucially, Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS) {{declined}} to participate in it, so despite KPP support, the strike did not spread to the cities, as SL hoped. Notheless some worker strikes did occur during that period. Even within SL not all activists were convinced {{it was a good}} idea; it was supported by Wincenty Witos and Stanisław Mikołajczyk, but criticized by Maciej Rataj.|$|E

Additionally, during 2008, she initiated a law raising teachers' salaries by 50%; this measure won <b>unanimous</b> parliamentary <b>approval.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Buffalo Bills {{received}} a <b>unanimous</b> vote of <b>approval</b> {{to play a}} series of regular and preseason games at Rogers Centre in Toronto from 2008 to 2017, This was separate from the regular International Series as arrangements are made by the team {{as opposed to the}} league as with the International Series.

500|$|The city of Dallas {{received}} the building well, {{and a local}} television news crew found <b>unanimous</b> <b>approval</b> of the new city hall when it officially {{opened to the public}} in 1978. Pei himself considered the project a success, even as he worried about the arrangement of its elements. He said: [...] "It's perhaps stronger than I would have liked; it's got more strength than finesse." [...] He felt that his relative lack of experience left him without the necessary design tools to refine his vision, but the community liked the city hall enough to invite him back. Over the years he went on to design five additional buildings in the Dallas area.|$|E
5000|$|In early June 2014, Klimkin's {{candidacy}} for the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine was proposed by Petro Poroshenko, the recently appointed Ukrainian President.

25|$|Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry {{stated that}} he {{expected}} Clinton to face some tough questions, but {{thought she was going}} to do a good job at (being Secretary of State). Christopher Hitchens of Vanity Fair called her nomination a ludicrous embarrassment on the edition of November 18, 2008 of Hardball due to the Clintons' overseas connections, her actions during the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) voted against a <b>unanimous</b> voice <b>approval,</b> citing ethical concerns. He sought not to block the nomination through a filibuster, but to voice his opposition to her policies. Senator David Vitter (R-Louisiana) also voted against Clinton in Committee citing her husband's foreign donations for his non-profit entities.|$|R
50|$|Laws {{to require}} public {{buildings}} and facilities {{to be designed}} and constructed accessible to dis-abled persons were established in Sri Lanka in 1996 and further strengthened {{by the introduction of}} accessibility regulations under this law in 2005 and thereafter, receiving <b>unanimous</b> Parliament <b>approval</b> 0n 20 March 2007. However, inept bureaucracy failed to establish a formal mechanism to implement and pursue the legislation and thereby to deliver practical effect, even in respect of new public buildings. Violators roam scot-free, significant setbacks to gainful opportunities of disabled people, increasing numbers hence driven towards poverty affecting even their immediate families, waste of human potential, etc., and thereby reduce our limited resources causing substantial losses to the country.|$|R
