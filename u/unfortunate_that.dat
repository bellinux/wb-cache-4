5|$|In the March 2009 speech {{entitled}} Reform the International Monetary System, Zhou Xiaochuan, {{the governor}} of the People's Bank of China, came out in favour of Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency. Zhou argued that it was <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> {{part of the reason for}} the Bretton Woods system breaking down was the failure to adopt Keynes's bancor. Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs).|$|E
5|$|Given this, it is <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> the Cypria—the {{part of the}} Epic Cycle {{that covers}} {{the period of the}} Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative of his story remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and many do not tally with the form of the myth that scholars now believe to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E

This is a...it is an honor and a privilege {{to be in the}} briefing room, and to suggest that we, the United States, are killing innocent people is just absurd and very offensive.|$|E

25|$|Merchant's Test career spanned 18 {{years but}} {{during that time}} he played only ten Test matches, and was <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> {{some of the best}} years of his career were lost to the Second World War, when no {{international}} cricket was played. He also missed tours to Australia and the West Indies due to poor health. However, Merchant went out to score 154 in his last Test match against England in Delhi, which was also his highest Test score. A shoulder injury incurred while fielding in that game forced him to retire. All ten matches of Merchant's Test career were against England.|$|E
25|$|Lilian Whiting's {{biography}} (Louise Chandler Moulton, Poet and Friend. Illustrated. Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1910) was {{direct and}} clear in its method, chronological and narrative rather than critical, compiled {{largely from the}} letters of Moulton and from the journal that was kept faithfully from age eight to {{the last days of}} failing health. With due acknowledgment of Moulton's gifts of personal charm and poetic sentiment and refinement, few discriminating readers ascribed to her verses that quality of genius. So it was considered <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> Whiting began her biography with this word, as one of the implied characteristics of her subject. In her general treatment of Moulton's poetry, however, Whiting showed justice and reserve as well as sympathetic appreciation.|$|E
25|$|For {{the general}} growth of cricket in the United States, {{it was most}} <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> this {{pioneering}} tour occurred only 18 months before the American Civil War began. If the war had not broken out, it is highly likely that two or three follow-up tours might have been arranged in the early 1860s, thus building on the interest created by the initial trip. As it was, the enthusiasm for cricket faded in the war years and the troops on both sides adopted the embryonic game of baseball. When English teams resumed tours to America in 1868, {{not only did they}} have to try to rekindle the enthusiasm, but in baseball they had a serious rival to contend with.|$|E

25|$|The IRA gave clear {{reasons for}} the execution. I think it is <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> anyone has to be killed, but the furor created by Mountbatten's death showed up the hypocritical {{attitude}} of the media establishment. As {{a member of the}} House of Lords, Mountbatten was an emotional figure in both British and Irish politics. What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had been doing all his life to other people; and with his war record I don't think he could have objected to dying in what was clearly a war situation. He knew the danger involved in coming to this country. In my opinion, the IRA achieved its objective: people started paying attention to what was happening in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Goryeo (Koryo) {{architecture}} {{is defined as}} the period between the 10th century and the 14th century. Much of the architecture in this period was related to religion and influenced by political power/ kingdom. Many buildings such as magnificent Buddhist temples and pagodas were developed based on religious needs, as Buddhism {{played an important role in}} the culture and society at the time. It is <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> little has survived to the present day, since most of the architecture from this period was built of wood. Also, the capital of the Goryeo dynasty was based in Gaesong, a city in modern-day North Korea. Its location has made it difficult for many historians in South Korea to study and analyze the architecture of this era.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrary}} to economic reasons described by India and Pakistan, common fishermen {{of both countries}} get trapped in conflict and their economic rights of earning get affected. It has seen that government of India and Pakistan regularly arrest fishermen of each other for crossing the boundary, however for a common fisherman, {{it is always a}} wonder to know where the boundary starts and ends in sea. This unawareness are added with wind flow, waves and turbulence that push the boat in sea. While UN law advocates for minimum penalty for this offence and release of boats, but government of India and Pakistan catch these prisoners and keep them in prisons for long time. It is more <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> their release happens through land boundary of India and Pakistan (Wagha border) and these poor fishermen come to their home country without their boats.|$|E

25|$|A renewed {{interest}} in Keynesian ideas {{was not limited to}} Western countries and stimulus plans were a common response to the crisis from nations across the globe. Stimulus packages in Asia were on a par with those in Europe and America. In a speech delivered in March 2009 entitled Reform the International Monetary System, Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, revived Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency. Dr Zhou argued that it was <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> Keynes's bancor proposal was not accepted at Bretton Woods in the 1940s. He argued that national currencies were unsuitable for use as global reserve currencies {{as a result of the}} Triffin dilemma – the difficulty faced by reserve currency issuers in trying to simultaneously achieve their domestic monetary policy goals and meet other countries' demand for reserve currency. Zhou proposed a gradual move towards adopting IMF special drawing rights (SDRs) as a centrally managed global reserve currency.|$|E
25|$|Bhishma {{is often}} {{considered}} as {{a great example of}} devotion and sacrifice. His name itself is an honour to him - Bhishma which means severe because he took a severe vow to remain celibate for life and Pitamah which means Grandfather. Bhishma {{was one of the greatest}} Bramhacharis of all time. Accumulation of Ojas due to his Bramhacharyam made him the strongest warrior of the era. He had stature and personality that in those times were fit for kings. He was a true Kshatriya as well as a disciplined ascetic - a rare combination. Like a true Kshatriya, he never unnecessarily exhibited passion and anger. A symbol of truth and duty, the benevolent Bhishma was in all senses a true human. It is <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> a person as noble as Bhishma saw a life full of loneliness, frustration and sadness. But that was how Vashishta's curse was supposed to unfold. Bhishma's human birth was destined to be marked with suffering, and that was how his life transpired right till the last moment; even his death was very painful. But the strong as steel character which he possessed ensured that he never shied away from his duty, and never stopped loving those dear to him.|$|E

500|$|Dworsky was {{eventually}} told {{to stop working}} on the drawings before he completed them, but he defended himself against Gehry's criticism. [...] "Knowledgeable people were supportive of us. They were saying it's a very complex and unusual design, and they can understand the difficulties in trying to achieve this within a limited budget and a limited schedule. It was <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> Frank came out with his criticism, {{but he was the}} center of the storm, having designed the building, and he was just trying to lessen the blame on himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all {{academics}} {{accepted the}} criticism against Keynes – Minsky {{has argued that}} Keynesian economics had been debased by excessive mixing with neoclassical ideas from the 1950s, {{and that it was}} <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> this branch of economics had even continued to be called [...] "Keynesian". Writing in The American Prospect, Robert Kuttner argued it was not so much excessive Keynesian activism that caused the economic problems of the 1970s but the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of capital controls, which allowed capital flight from regulated economies into unregulated economies in a fashion similar to Gresham's law phenomenon (where weak currencies undermine strong currencies).|$|E

500|$|Anthropologist Galina Lindquist of the University of Stockholm {{published}} a review in The Australian Journal of Anthropology, referring to Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld as [...] "a welcome contribution" [...] containing [...] "valuable" [...] ethnographic material. Noting that it joins {{the work of}} anthropologists like Jeanne Favret-Saada, Paul Stoller, and E. Turner, Lindquist praises {{the manner in which}} Greenwood put contemporary practices into historical perspective, and how she illuminates the [...] "strains and contradictions" [...] within the magical milieu. She believes that Greenwood's arguments would have been strengthened had she made use of a more in-depth ethnographic study of magical morality, and considers it <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> Greenwood had not touched on ritual studies.|$|E
500|$|Adult {{entertainment}} attorney Robert Apgood stated {{he agreed}} with the actions of Acworth and Randazza. Apgood pointed out he had observed {{a significant increase in}} applications to the USPTO that were rejected because their potential trademarks were deemed [...] "scandalous" [...] by the government. He stated, [...] "It's really quite <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> the executive branch is now reaching deep into the machinations of government to further its 'legislation of morality' agenda. It is truly encouraging to see the likes of Acworth and Randazza take up this sorely needed fight." [...] The appeal was denied in April 2008 and the case was terminated. The application status was last listed as [...] "abandoned" [...] for failure to respond by the appealing party.|$|E
500|$|The committee, which met in private, heard {{numerous}} theories as to {{the causes}} of the fire, including the lax attitude of plumbers working in the Lords, carelessness of the servants at Howard's Coffee House—situated inside the palace—and a gas explosion. Other rumours began to circulate; the Prime Minister received an anonymous letter claiming that the fire was an arson attack. The committee issued its report on 8 November, which identified the burning of the tallies as the cause of the fire. The committee thought it unlikely that Cross and Furlong had been as careful in filling the furnaces as they had claimed, and the report stated that [...] "it is <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> Mr Weobley did not more effectively superintend the burning of the tallies".|$|E
