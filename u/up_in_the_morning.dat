Because the ship, already {{prepared for a}} fast sinking for the blockship duties, began taking on water, {{a large portion of}} the crew, including Chief Engineer Poropat, abandoned ship. After drifting in the Channel for most of the rest of the moonless night, they were picked <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> by a British trawler and returned to the UK. In the meantime, the master of the ship was able to keep West Honaker in the convoy headed to Utah beach.|$|E

Atlantis has enough consumables to stay in orbit until Monday.|$|E

25|$|A schema (pl. schemata) is {{the mental}} {{framework}} that is created as children {{interact with their}} physical and social environments. For example, many 3-year-olds insist that the sun is alive because it comes <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and goes down at night. According to Piaget, these children are operating based on a simple cognitive schema that things that move are alive. At any age, children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them. Moreover, younger and older children may often interpret {{and respond to the}} same objects and events in very different ways because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages.|$|E

According to an anonymous contemporary obituary in the Pall Mall Gazette, Legge was in his study every morning at three o'clock, winter and summer, having retired to bed at ten. When he got <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> {{the first thing he}} did was to make himself a cup of tea over a spirit-lamp.

25|$|Delayed sleep phase {{disorder}} (DSPD), {{more often}} known as delayed sleep phase syndrome {{and also as}} delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, is a chronic dysregulation of a person's circadian rhythm (biological clock), compared {{to the general population}} and relative to societal norms. The disorder affects the timing of sleep, peak period of alertness, the core body temperature rhythm, and hormonal and other daily cycles. People with DSPD generally fall asleep some hours after midnight and have difficulty waking <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> People with DSPD probably have a circadian period significantly longer than 24 hours. Depending on the severity, the symptoms can be managed {{to a greater or lesser}} degree, but no cure is known, and research suggests a genetic origin for the disorder.|$|E

25|$|Historians {{have been}} using his diary to gain greater insight and {{understanding}} of life in London in the 17th century. Pepys wrote consistently on subjects such as personal finances, {{the time he got}} <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> the weather, and what he ate. He talked at length about his new watch (which had an alarm, a new thing at the time) which he was very proud of, a country visitor who did not enjoy his time in London because he felt that it was too crowded, and his cat waking him up at one in the morning. Pepys's diary is one of the only known sources which provides such length in details of everyday life of an upper middle class man during the seventeenth century.|$|E
25|$|Childhood amnesia (also {{known as}} {{infantile}} amnesia) {{is the common}} inability to remember events from one's own childhood. Sigmund Freud notoriously attributed this to sexual repression, while modern scientific approaches generally attribute it to aspects of brain development or developmental psychology, including language development, which may be why people do not easily remember pre-language events. Researchers have found that implicit memories cannot be recalled or described. Remembering {{how to play the}} piano is a common example of implicit memory, as is walking, speaking and other everyday activities that would be difficult to focus on if they had to be relearned every time one got <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> Explicit memories, on the other hand, can be recalled and described in words. Remembering the first time meeting a teacher is an example of explicit memories.|$|E
