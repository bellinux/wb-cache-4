The Government has examined thoroughly the accounts of the Chinese Commercial Bank and finds that its assets exceed the liabilities. The present trouble {{is partly due to}} the fact that many traders are hoarding their money instead of paying it into the bank. The Government now allows the shareholders of the bank to raise ready money; if no cash can be raised then they must make a call on the <b>unpaid</b> <b>capital</b> to meet this emergency. If the bank is able within a reasonable time to raise cash, the Government will certainly lend it a sum of money equal to the amount so raised. The bank is authorised to collect all debts due to it in the usual way. Further it should be well known to all that in the present time of war, people who have cash should pay it into the various banks in the Colony and thus allow it to circulate freely to help commerce and should not hoard it. Hoarding not only does no good to those who hoard but will certainly do harm to the local situation and thus help the enemy." ...|$|E
40|$|The in duplum rule is {{a rule of}} Roman-Dutch origin {{which has}} been {{preserved}} by the South African common law. A useful consumer-protection device, it temporarily ceases interest once arrear interest has reached the <b>unpaid</b> <b>capital.</b> The rule distinguishes between arrear and accrued interest. Arrear interest is interest that has become due but because of non-payment it has accumulated. While accrued interest is also accumulated interest, this type of interest has not become due and payable. The in duplum rule prevents arrear interest from accumulating to more than the <b>unpaid</b> <b>capital</b> amount. This preclusion is only temporary, however, {{and as soon as}} the debtor makes payment towards the debt, the interest begins to run again. The in duplum rule has no effect on accrued interest. Thus, when parties agree that the capital amount plus the interest component of the debt will be paid at a future date, without installments by the debtor in the interim, the in duplum rule will have no effect on the total amount owing. The rule has recently been incorporated into the National Credit Bill of 2005. The rule seems to have been codified without due caution to its carefully sculpted common law developments. The courts have over the years cleared misconceptions that the rule prevented any interest from accruing to more than the <b>unpaid</b> <b>capital</b> or that the rule permanently affected the running of interest. The work of the courts has somewhat been neglected in clause 103 (5) of the National Credit Bill which appears to include in its interest component more than just interest. This may have a very dramatic effect on the profit element of the risk takers (credit lenders) and may in the long term curb investment in the lending market. The effect of the codified in duplum rule remains to be seen through the actions of the lawmaker, and if the codified form of the rule is accepted into law, the burden will once again lie with the judiciary.

40|$|The seminal work of J. B. Jefferys {{highlighted}} two unusual {{features of}} the Victorian equity market, namely high share denomination and uncalled capital. This article examines {{the extent to which}} publicly traded company stocks in the nineteenth century had these features. It also analyses the effect of these features on stock returns using monthly data for the London Stock Market over the period 1825 - 70. We find that stocks with <b>unpaid</b> <b>capital</b> earned a higher return, which is consistent with investors being rewarded for the risk of a call on their personal assets. We also find that stocks with a high share denomination earned a lower return, which is consistent with the view that this feature was conducive to superior corporate governance...|$|E
50|$|Gross {{household}} {{product is}} a specific estimation of the economic value added by the <b>unpaid</b> work and <b>capital</b> of households. It does not include many of the additional factors typically included in GPI determinations but focuses specifically on the “household economy.” Duncan Ironmonger defines a country's Gross Economic Product as comprising both the Gross Market Product (typically defined as GDP) and Gross Household Product. Using one of the same time use surveys as the BEA study referenced above (the American Time Use Survey), Ironmonger estimates the USA's 2011 GHP at 11.6 trillion dollars (as compared to a GDP of 13.3 trillion).|$|R
40|$|Information is {{provided}} on the return, cost and financial efficiency for niche pork production. Information from 18 niche pork producers {{is included in}} the analysis. Return levels showed that the average return to <b>capital,</b> <b>unpaid</b> labor and management return to <b>capital,</b> <b>unpaid</b> labor and management for the top 6 producers was $ 5. 23 per hundred pounds of pork produced, while this average was -$ 10. 68 for the bottom 6 producers and -$ 3. 80 for all 18 producers. The average margin over all costs on a per head sold basis showed a large loss ($- 52. 89 for the average producer). The average return per hour of labor after all costs was -$ 12. 36 for all 18 producers, but $ 9. 23 per hour for the top 6 producers and -$ 9. 82 for the bottom 6 producers. The average total cost per hundred pounds of pork produced for all producers was $ 81. 40, while the top third (6) had average total costs that were $ 32. 43 less than the bottom 6 producers ($ 66. 52 vs $ 98. 75). Production costs increased by about 21 percent over the 2007 level. The main contributor to cost differences between the top third and bottom third producers was operating costs, which included feed and other operating expenses and labor costs. These costs represented the majority of the total cost difference and were about equally split between the two; operating costs (feed and other) and labor costs. The information summarized here shows striking differences in many areas between the top 6 and bottom 6 producers. The areas with the largest differences are places with the most potential to help producers improve. Educational programming that targets these areas is being developed to help these producers make changes to improve their operations, which in turn will improve the position of this sector of the industry...|$|R
50|$|There is {{considerable}} confusion between LLPs as constituted in the U.S. and those {{introduced in the}} UK in 2001 and adopted elsewhere (see below) as the UK LLP is, despite its name, specifically legislated as a corporate body {{rather than as a}} partnership.In Nigeria, limited liability partnerships have legal personality. However, one must register a partnership first before it can gain the status of limited liability partnership.In Kenya, limited liability partnerships similarly have legal personality distinct from its member partners. The liability of the partners is limited to any amount that may remain <b>unpaid</b> over the <b>capital</b> of the partnership. However, partners may be deemed liable for omissions or actions done by themselves if they lacked the relevant authority from the partnership or the affected party knew that such partner lacked authority or had {{no reason to believe that}} such person was a partner in the partnership. Registration is what vests such legal personality upon the entity. Registration is done by the registrar of Companies after meeting.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the ability of}} the family to perform both its economic and institutional functions in today's economy. We argue that individual and family choice with respect to paid and unpaid labor is severely limited. This lack of alternatives in work is generated by three social forces that shape the economic landscape: (1) a tradition rooted in patriarchy; (2) the market system; and (3) the social policies of the state. We create a framework within which the work of families can be analyzed over the past two decades. The analysis is based on data from three waves of the PSID: 1972, 1983, and 1992. Three family types—dual-earner, male-earner, and female-earner family structures—are examined for the nature and intensity of the work effort, the change in labor commitment over time, changes in real income and hourly earnings, and the effect of the increasing encroachment of the market on the family's distribution of labor between the two spheres. Finally, the work of families is examined {{within the context of the}} social policies of government, including a review of the institutional difficulties of providing family friendly policies in the current social environment. work of families, paid and <b>unpaid</b> work, social <b>capital,</b> family wage, work hours, family policy,...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the relative efficiency of farmers in various age groups. Nine Hundred sixty-four sole proprietors, who were members of the Kansas Farm Management Association (KFMA) with continuous data from 2002 - 2006, were split up into four groups based on age. Comparing the fourth age group (over 65 years of age) to the first age group (under or equal to 45 years of age) was of primary importance in this study. Comparisons were made utilizing variables pertaining to farm size and tenure, specialization, efficiency, liquidity, and solvency. In this study, there are four age groups; under or equal to 45 years, 46 to 55 years, 56 to 65 years, and greater than 65 years old. T-tests were used to compare variables among age groups. Nineteen variables were statistically different between age groups one and four. The fourth age group performed poorly in terms of cost efficiency. Based on the results, the fourth age group had a difficult time covering <b>unpaid</b> labor and <b>capital</b> expenses. Discriminant analysis was used to determine which variables discriminate the most between age groups.

40|$|There is {{consensus}} among economists that off-farm income sources {{need to be}} taken into account for analysing the economic situation of farming families. If data collection is based on accounting, the analysis can be improved by combining the well-known key figures derived from profit and loss accounts with cash flow indicators. These cash flow indicators should not only cover farm and off-farm sources, but also measure private expenditure of the family. The resulting operating cash flow of the farm household shows the potential for investment, savings or paying off loans. Examples taken from the Swiss Farm Accountancy Data Network illustrate that total investment is covered by the operating cash flow to a large degree, despite the relatively low performance of the farm itself. Aspects of diversity and problems of representativity {{need to be taken}} into account. 1 CHF ∪ 1. 5 €, 1 € ∪ 0. 66 CHF The “income gap”: What is the problem? 1. Family farm income is a net profit indicator derived from farm accounts. By definition it should remunerate the family’s input of <b>unpaid</b> labour and <b>capital.</b> The analysis of a time series carried out by the Swiss Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) shows that, over a long period of time, family farm income is considerably lower than private consumption. The gap even increases if calculated costs for unpaid labour and for net worth invested in the farm are taken as a reference point (average salaries of employees; average interest on long-term governmental bonds; see Figure 1). For other European countries, the results would probably be similar. As income objectives for the farming sector are an important element of the agricultural policy in most (if not all) OECD countries, the relatively low income is a common argument for maintaining or increasing public support...|$|R
40|$|The average net {{farm income}} is $ 66, 412 for the 62 farms {{included}} in the 1999 annual report of the Southeastern Minnesota Farm Business Management Association. This is an increase of 1 % from 1998. Even though gross cash farm income increased, cash expenses and depreciation also increased and inventory values changed little. Income is still {{at a high level}} compared to the early 1990 s and the 1980 s. (Net farm income is an accrual measure calculated by subtracting cash farm expenses and depreciation from total cash farm income and adjusting the difference for changes in other capital and inventory items.) After subtracting an opportunity cost for equity <b>capital,</b> <b>unpaid</b> labor and management earnings follow a similar but lower pattern. As in previous years, the income levels experienced by individual farms vary greatly from the overall average. The high 20 % of these farms had an average net farm income of $ 222, 349 in 1999; farms in the low 20 %, -$ 10, 442. This is an increase for both the high group and the low group. Average gross cash farm income in 1999 was $ 411, 665 for these 62 farms. This is a 29 % increase from 1998. Together, milk, corn, hog, and soybean sales were 75 % of gross income in 1999. Compared to 1998, milk sales increased by 6 %; corn sales by 26 %; beef finishing sales by 26 %. Hog sales increased by 270 % from the extremely low levels in 1997. Soybean sales decreased by 9 %. Government payments (of all types) more than doubled from an average of $ 23, 322 in 1998 to $ 50, 700 in 1999. (They were $ 12, 907 in 1997.) Government payments were 12 % of gross income in 1999, compared to 7 % in 1998 and 4 % in 1997. Average total cash expenses were $ 314, 644 in 1999. This is an increase of 31 % from the 1998 average. As a percentage of both cash expenses and depreciation, feed expenses were 20 % in 1999, up from 1998. Seed, fertilizer, and crop chemicals were 15 % of the total, down from 1998. Interest expense was 6 % of the total, lower than in 1998. Real estate taxes amounted to 2 % in 1999 [...] slightly lower in percentage but slightly higher in absolute dollar level. Both the rate of return on assets (ROA) and the rate of return to equity (ROE) remained unchanged on average. However, ROA was slightly higher than ROE indicating that debt capital was earning less than it was costing. Average total equity (of the 49 sole proprietors) was $ 523, 529 at the end of 1999, an increase of $ 45, 645 during the year. (Assets were valued on a cost basis.) Except for a decline during 1993, average equity has improved steadily since 1986. At the end of 1999, the average debt-asset ratio was down slightly to 34 %. In 1999, crop yields were lower than the record levels of 1998 for the Association. The average corn yield was 156 bushels per acre; soybeans were at 45 bushels per acre. Results by Type of Farm The 62 farms in the report are classified as a certain type (e. g., dairy) on the basis of having 70 percent or more of their gross sales from that category. Using this 70 percent rule, there are 9 crop farms, 16 dairy farms, and 7 crop and dairy farms, and 7 crop and hog farms. There are 18 farms which do not have a single source (or pair of sources) of income over 70 %. The average crop and dairy farm had the highest average net farm income ($ 145, 058) in 1999. The average dairy farm had the second highest net farm income. In terms of the rate of return to assets (ROA), dairy farms and crop and dairy farms have the highest ROA (10 %) in 1999. (Assets are valued on a cost basis.) (There were less than 5 crop and hog farms in 1998, so that information is not reported.) Crop and hog farms had an average debt-asset ratio of 48 % in 1999; crop farms averaged 46 %; and other farms averaged less than 40 %. The report provides additional information on profitability, liquidity, and solvency as well as other whole-farm information and detailed information on crop and livestock enterprises.
