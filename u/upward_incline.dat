40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of an inductive flow tomography (IFT) system, employing a multi-electrode electromagnetic flow meter (EMFM) and novel reconstruction techniques, for measuring the local water velocity distribution in water continuous single and multiphase flows. A series of experiments were carried out in vertical-upward and upward-inclined single phase water flows and 'water continuous' gas–water and oil–gas–water flows in which the velocity profiles ranged from axisymmetric (single phase and vertical-upward multiphase flows) to highly asymmetric (upward-inclined multiphase flows). Using potential difference measurements obtained from the electrode array of the EMFM, local axial velocity distributions of the continuous water phase were reconstructed using two different IFT reconstruction algorithms denoted RT# 1, which assumes that the overall water velocity profile comprises the sum {{of a series of}} polynomial velocity components, and RT# 2, which is similar to RT# 1 but which assumes that the zero'th order velocity component may be replaced by an axisymmetric 'power law' velocity distribution. During each experiment, measurement of the local water volume fraction distribution was also made using the well-established technique of electrical resistance tomography (ERT). By integrating the product of the local axial water velocity and the local water volume fraction in the cross section an estimate of the water volumetric flow rate was made which was compared with a reference measurement of the water volumetric flow rate. In vertical upward flows RT# 2 was found to give rise to water velocity profiles which are consistent with the previous literature although the profiles obtained in the multiphase flows had relatively higher central velocity peaks than was observed for the single phase profiles. This observation was almost certainly a result of the transfer of axial momentum from the less dense dispersed phases to the water, which occurred preferentially at the pipe centre. For <b>upward</b> <b>inclined</b> multiphase flows RT# 1 was found to give rise to water velocity profiles which are more consistent with results in the previous literature than was the case for RT# 2 —which leads to the tentative conclusion that the <b>upward</b> <b>inclined</b> multiphase flows investigated in the present study did not contain significant axisymmetric velocity components...|$|R

40|$|Multiphase flow is the {{simultaneous}} flow {{of two or}} more phases, in direct contact, in a given system. It is important in many fields of chemical and process engineering and in the oil industry, e. g. in production wells and in sub-sea pipelines. The behavior of the flow will depend on the properties of the constituents, the flows and the geometry of the system. <b>Upward</b> <b>inclined</b> solids-liquid flows are sometimes encountered in the process industries for example in water treatment processes and in oil well drilling operations. Measurements of the local solids volume fraction distribution and the local axial solid velocity distribution are important, for example, in measuring the solids volumetric flow rate. This paper presents a non-intrusive Impedance Cross-Correlation (ICC) device to measure the local solids volume fraction distribution and the local axial solids velocity distribution in <b>upward</b> <b>inclined</b> solids-water flows in which these distributions are highly non-uniform. The ICC device comprises a non-conductive pipe section of 80 mm internal diameter fitted with two arrays of electrodes at planes, A and B, separated by an axial distance of 50 mm. At each plane, eight electrodes are equispaced over the internal circumference of the pipe. A control system consisting of a microcontroller and analogue switches is used such that, for planes A and B, any of the eight electrodes can be configured as an ‘excitation electrode’ (V+), a ‘virtual earth measurement electrode’ (ve) or an ‘earth electrode’ (E) so that different regions of the flow cross section can be interrogated. Conductance signals from planes A and B are then cross correlated to yield the solids velocity in the region of flow under interrogation. Experiments were carried out in water-solids flows in a flow loop with an 80 mm inner diameter, 1. 68 m long Perspex test section which was inclined at o 30 to the vertical. The most significant experimental result is that, at the upper side of the inclined pipe, the measured solids velocity is positive (i. e. in the upward direction), whilst at the lower side of the inclined pipe the measured local axial solids velocity is negative (i. e. in the downward direction). This shows quantitative agreement with previous work carried out using intrusive local probes to measure the solids velocity profile. The study also shows qualitative agreement with high speed film of the flow.

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how perceptions of immigrants are formed and constructed, symbolic interactionism theory has been utilized. Immigration into the United States {{has been on the}} rise since 1965. Public opinion polls have demonstrated [...] "that the percentage of Americans who wanted immigration decreased to be very low immediately prior to 1965, but had begun an <b>upward</b> <b>incline</b> from 1965 to the late 1970's at which time it thereafter increased dramatically". One of the reasons why there is a negative native response to increased immigration is because of the often-negative images of immigrants being elicited by the media. Moreover, immigration legislation, such as the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, increased anti-immigration sentiment, and nativist rhetoric, and social movements in the United States. Perceived group threat also has been proven to maintain an important role in explaining Americans' attitude toward immigrants. Fear of foreigners altering aspects of the established culture, such as the native language, results in nativist sentiment and further polarization. Together, these instances illustrate the significance of immigrants' master status in shaping how others perceive them, and how they perceive themselves. For example, the racial stigma that Mexican immigrants encounter in the United States [...] "reinforces the low status and the self perceptions of Mexican Americans". When Mexican Americans internalize this perception of their race, they begin to act accordingly and indirectly reinforce this perception.|$|E

The sketches on 2 / 14 / 94 thru 2 / 16 / 94 are refinements of the early 1992 and 1993 sketches. They pick out quite a bit more detail of specific detector components along the path. The dimensional sketches of 1992 and 1993 gave information in not as much detail and therefore gave a more constrained clearance description. Most of the information of the early sketches was jotted down on the plan view dated 10 - 29 - 92. This sketch also had some information lifted from prints which later was superseded by the 1994 sketches. I tried to label components and give views either titled 'Elevation' or 'Plan' which refers to a top view looking down. Also where I could I jotted down direction, ie. South, East etc. Hopefully with a little effort one can decifer it. The curvature of the CC was determined from a three dimensional topographical survey.

To contribute and further enhance the general understanding of heat transfer in non-boiling two phase flow, the main focus of this work is to experimentally measure local and average convective heat transfer coefficients for different flow patterns in horizontal and near horizontal <b>upward</b> <b>inclined</b> two phase flow.

We examined also whether repeated handling associated with chronic treatment interferes with effects of fluoxetine on anxiety responses. The 3 D maze comprises 9 arms, each connected to an <b>upward</b> <b>inclined</b> bridge radiating from a central platform. In this maze, BALB/c mice cross frequently into the bridges but avoid the arms. This avoidance is used as an index of anxiety.

40|$|This master’s thesis {{focuses on}} the design of steam {{condensate}} system of steam power plants. Condensate is generated when fractions of extracted steam from the turbine transfer heat to feedwater in the feedwater heaters. Also small amounts of condensate form in steam pipelines due to radiation heat loss. The condensate produced in the steam using equipment and pipelines should be removed as quickly as possible in order to avoid various problems, such as fractures in pipeline fittings, loss of live steam and so forth. The recovered condensate is treated water containing sensible heat that accounts for approximately 10 % to 30 % of the total heat contained by the live steam. Thus the boiler fuel demand can be potentially reduced from 10 % to 20 % by economically recovering hot condensate. The proper design of condensate system requires detail knowledge about condensate piping network, different components of the system as well as various problems associated with condensate flow both in steam and condensate pipelines. In this study, major components of steam condensate system are presented, followed by a discussion of most common problems with condensate, such as water hammer, flash steam, pipe erosion and so on. For optimum design of steam condensate system, the study highlights recommendations for the slope of horizontal steam and condensate pipelines, analysis of condensate flow behaviour in <b>upward</b> <b>inclined</b> steam pipes, sizing of components, such as drain pockets, discharge lines from steam traps, and the importance of using different components in steam condensate system...|$|R
40|$|Multiphase flow is the {{simultaneous}} flow {{of two or}} more phases, in direct contact, and is important in the oil industry, e. g. in production wells, in sub-sea pipelines and during the drilling of wells. The behaviour of the flow will depend on the properties of the constituent phases, the flow velocities and volume fractions of the phases and the geometry of the system. In solids-in-liquid flows, measurement of the local solids volume fraction distribution and the local axial solids velocity distribution in the flow cross section is important for many reasons including health and safety and economic reasons, particularly in oil well drilling operations. However <b>upward</b> <b>inclined</b> solidsliquid flows which are frequently encountered during oil well drilling operations are not well understood. Inclined solids-liquid flows result in non- uniform profiles of the solids volume fraction and axial solids velocity in the flow cross- section. In order to measure the solids volumetric flow rate in these situations it is necessary to measure the distributions of the local solids volume fraction and the local axial solids velocity and then to integrate the product of these local properties in the flow cross section. This thesis describes the development of a non-intrusive Impedance Cross-Correlation (ICC) device to measure the local solids volume fraction distribution and the local solids axial solids velocity distribution in <b>upward</b> <b>inclined</b> solids-water flows in which these distributions are highly non-uniform. The ICC device comprises a non-conductive pipe section of 80 mm internal diameter fitted with two arrays of electrodes, denoted „array A‟ and „array B‟, separated by an axial distance of 50 mm. At each array, eight electrodes are equispaced over the internal circumference of the pipe. A control system consisting of a microcontroller and analogue switches is used such that, for arrays A and B, any of the eight electrodes can be configured as an "excitation electrode" (V+), a "virtual earth measurement electrode" (Ve) or an "earth electrode" (E) thus enabling the local mixture conductance in different regions of the flow cross-section to be measured and thereby allowing the local solids volume fraction in each region to be deduced. The conductance signals from arrays A and B are also cross-correlated to yield the local solids axial velocity in the regions of flow under interrogation. A number of experiments were carried out in solids-in-water flows in a flow loop with an 80 mm inner diameter, 1. 68 m long Perspex test section which was inclined at three different inclination angle to the vertical (o 0, o 15 and o 30). The obtained results show good quantitative agreement with previous work carried out using intrusive local probes. Integration of the flow profiles in the cross section also yielded excellent quantitative agreement with reference measurements of the mean solids volume fraction, the mean solids velocity and the solids volumetric flow rate. Furthermore, this study also showed good qualitative agreement with high speed film of the flow. It is believed that the method of velocity and volume fraction profile measurement described in this thesis is much simpler to implement, more accurate and less expensive than the currently very popular technique of dual-plane Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT). Finally, the thesis describes a mathematical model for predicting the axial velocity distribution of inclined solids-water flows using the solids volume fraction profiles measured by the ICC device. Good agreement was obtained between the predicted velocity profiles and the velocity profiles measured using the ICC device. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The platform was elevated 75 and 100 cm from the ground, in a standard (SPDS) and in a raised (RPDS) configuration, respectively. In experiment 2, the platform was elevated 75 cm from the ground.

SAL mice also crossed frequently onto the arms, and reached a comparable ratio, but this was achieved with a lower number of arm visits. MKD 1 mice demonstrated a reduced number of arm visits in each session compared to SAL and MKD 4 mice. Dizocilpine produced anxiety in mice treated from day 1 of the test, but not in those treated from day 4. It also impaired habituation in animals familiar with the test environment; it produced sustained non-habituating hyperactivity...|$|R
40|$|To improve bycatch {{mitigation}} of chondrichthyans, reptiles and cetaceans for {{a tropical}} demersal fish-trawl fishery, species-specific responses to bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) were investigated using both in situ subsurface and onboard observations. There are few, if any, {{studies that have}} determined mitigation performances of BRDs from subsurface interactions for these species, as most are rarely encountered and thus require substantial levels of observer coverage for robust assessments. This study combined in-net and onboard (774 [*]day trawls and 1320 [*]day trawl hours of subsurface observer coverage) electronic monitoring on all fish-trawl vessels (n = 3) to compare bycatch mitigation performances among nine megafauna groups, based on escape rates and interaction durations for three BRDs over 6 months (June to December 2012). Overall, 26. 9 % of day trawls had no megafauna interactions and 38. 3 % of the 1826 interactions escaped, with most in rapid time (91. 4 % in[*]≤[*] 5 [*]min). The <b>upward</b> <b>inclined</b> exclusion grid significantly improved the escape proportions for most chondrichthyans by 20 – 30 %. All BRDs were highly effective in reducing reptile (turtles and seasnakes) bycatch, but irrelevant for the few sawfish (n[*]=[*] 13) that readily entangled in the anterior of the net. Cetacean (bottlenose dolphins only) interactions with BRDs were very rare (n[*]=[*] 7) despite high levels of attendance and depredation during trawling. Loss of targeted teleosts through the BRD hatch was rare (1. 3 % of day trawls). This relatively cost-effective method of electronic monitoring achieved very high levels of subsurface observer coverage (60 % of day trawls or 56 % of day trawl hours), and provided evidence that the subsurface expulsion of megafauna in poor condition is negligible. Furthermore, this study provides species-specific improvements toward bycatch mitigation strategies for demersal fish trawling...|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{for anyone}} wishing {{to explore the}} {{parallel}} corridor concept personally, we would suggest mounting the indicator in such place that both airspeed and speedometer could be read at the same time. It is customary in mounting the Pitot tube (any tube will do) that the first bend behind the opening to the air be <b>inclined</b> <b>upward</b> to prevent water (from rain) to accumulate and block pressure. In our case, a small diameter silicone rubber tube connected the Pitot tube to the airspeed indicator.|$|R
