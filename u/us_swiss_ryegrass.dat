30|$|The early Argentine {{legal system}} was {{an outcome of}} a long {{political}} struggle from the period of independence (the failed Assembly of 1813 which tried to unite the provinces and establish government) until the country was finally unified (1859). Early efforts to write a constitution failed, not least given tension between centralists in Buenos Aires and opposing forces elsewhere. The other provinces, minus Buenos Aires province, promulgated the first Constitution in 1853, under the intellectual influence of Alberdi, with clear inspiration from the <b>US,</b> <b>Swiss,</b> and other early constitutions. The Argentine civil code only came later, in 1869, after unification, and was written by Vélez Sársfield.|$|R

From 1980 they featured DOT-approved 5 mi/h km/h safety bumpers front and rear. Most of these cars have since been retrofitted with full power, European spec engines.|$|R

In April 1945 the Wehrmacht and officials of the Reichsbank approved a plan to store {{at least part of}} the reserves of the German Reichsbank at Einsiedl, a small hamlet on the south-west shore. Subsequently, the assets were buried in an undisclosed location in the crags above the Obernach power-plant. The assets consisted of 365 sacks, each with two gold bars, nine envelopes with gold documents, four crates of gold, two bags of gold coins, six boxes of Danish coins, and 94 sacks of foreign currency.

40|$|A pot {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate whether differences in the amounts of Zn and Cd taken up by a number of plant species (canola, capeweed, subterranean clover, lettuce, <b>swiss</b> chard, <b>ryegrass,</b> and wheat) growing in a single soil could be explained as the result of plants having access to different soil pools of Zn and Cd. Prior to potting, the soil was spiked with carrier-free 65 Zn and 109 Cd. Total shoot concentrations of both Zn and Cd varied greatly across the plant species studied. The concentration of Cd in the shoots ranged from 0 · 075 mg/kg in wheat cv. RAC to 2 · 27 mg/kg in capeweed, while the concentration of Zn in the shoots ranged from 33 mg/kg in wheat cv. RAC to 259 mg/kg in swiss chard. However, the specific activity of Zn in the shoots was found to be the same in all cases. Hence the experiments showed that all plant species were accessing the same pool of Zn in the soil, despite differences in the total amounts of Zn taken up. In contrast, the specific activity of Cd in canola was found to be nearly double the specific activity of Cd in the other plants, suggesting that canola was unable to access a pool of soil Cd that was available for uptake by the other species. The percentage of total soil Zn and Cd that was in bioavailable pools was calculated to be approximately 12 and 36 (or 20 % for canola), respectively, implying that significant percentages of these metals exist in non plant available forms in this soil.

30|$|This paper {{considers}} an expectations augmented {{version of}} the Engle and Granger (1987) error correction model and shows that standard inference about the adjustment coefficients can be severely biased.

The results are illustrated with popular macroeconomic relationships like the Fisher relation and uncovered interest parity hypothesis using <b>U.S.,</b> German and <b>Swiss</b> data.|$|R
