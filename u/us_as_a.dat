5|$|As {{early as}} 1837, the Republic made several {{attempts}} to negotiate annexation with the United States. Opposition within the republic from the nationalist faction, along with strong abolitionist opposition within the United States, slowed Texas's admission into the Union. Texas was finally annexed when the expansionist James K. Polk {{won the election}} of 1844. On December 29, 1845, Congress admitted Texas to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> constituent state of the Union.|$|E
5|$|Cameron's {{recognition}} {{as an artist}} increased after her death, when her paintings made appearances in exhibitions across the <b>U.S.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of increased attention on Parsons, Cameron's life also gained greater coverage in the early 2000s. In 2006, the Cameron–Parsons Foundation was created to preserve and promote her work, and in 2011 a biography of Cameron written by Spencer Kansa was published.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Vaughan Williams {{was elected}} {{president}} of the English Folk Dance and Song Society.

5|$|Rosenthal is {{referred}} to as the pioneer of research into seasonal affective disorder. In 1984, he coined the term and began studying the use of light therapy as a treatment. Rosenthal's interest in studying the effects of the seasons on mood changes emerged when he emigrated from the mild climate of Johannesburg, South Africa, to the northeastern <b>US.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> resident in the psychiatry program at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, he noticed that he was more energetic and productive during the long days of summer versus the shorter darker days of the winter.|$|E
5|$|Texas's {{population}} density is 90.5people per squaremile which is {{slightly higher than}} the average {{population density}} of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole, at 80.6people per squaremile. In contrast, while Texas and France are similarly sized geographically, the European country has a population density of 301.8 people per square mile.|$|E
5|$|The Røros Line was {{connected}} to the station at Brattøra at 24 June 1884, allowing Marienborg to be <b>us</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> common maintenance depot for both lines. The Meråker Line's locomotives were then renumbered, starting at 51, to keep them distinguished from the Røros Line's. From the same year, the Meråker Line was assigned two Class 8 locomotives. From 1896, Class 15 locomotives were used, and two years later supplemented by the Class 17.|$|E

5|$|About 30% of agrichemicals contain fluorine, {{most of them}} {{herbicides}} and fungicides with a few crop regulators. Fluorine substitution, usually of {{a single}} atom or at most a trifluoromethyl group, is a robust modification with effects analogous to fluorinated pharmaceuticals: increased biological stay time, membrane crossing, and altering of molecular recognition. Trifluralin is a prominent example, with large-scale use in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> weedkiller, {{but it is a}} suspected carcinogen and has been banned in many European countries. Sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) is a mammalian poison in which two acetic acid hydrogens are replaced with fluorine and sodium; it disrupts cell metabolism by replacing acetate in the citric acid cycle. First synthesized in the late 19th century, it was recognized as an insecticide in the early 20th, and was later deployed in its current use. New Zealand, the largest consumer of 1080, uses it to protect kiwis from the invasive Australian common brushtail possum. Europe and the U.S. have banned 1080.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 2010, the U.S. House of Representatives {{approved}} the Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act of 2010 (H.R.6160). The approved legislation {{is aimed at}} restoring the <b>U.S.</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> leading producer of rare-earth elements, and would support activities in the U.S. Department of Energy (US DoE) to discover and develop rare-earth sites inside of the U.S. {{in an effort to}} reduce the auto industry's near-complete dependence on China for the minerals. A similar bill, the Rare Earths Supply Technology and Resources Transformation Act of 2010 (S. 3521), is being discussed in the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|The bell of the Nishi-Arai Daishi Temple in Tokyo {{was removed}} in 1943, to be melted down {{as part of}} the Japanese war effort. The crew of the USS Pasadena found it on a scrap heap and took it with them to the <b>US</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> war trophy, {{donating}} it to the city of Pasadena; the city council returned the bell to Tokyo in 1955. A similar story accompanies the bell of Manpuku-ji, which was taken to the United States on the USS Boston after the war; in this case, however, the Sendai authorities allowed the bell to remain in Boston as a symbol of friendship between the two cities. The Boston bell is the last WWII bonshō in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The city of Galveston became {{important}} in the slave trade, establishing itself as the largest slave market west of New Orleans. Census records from 1860 show a population of 1178 slaves (and two free blacks) compared to 6000 free persons living in the city. The proportion of slaves, however, was somewhat less {{than the rest of}} Texas. Tensions over slavery in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole eventually led to the American Civil War, which Texas joined {{on the side of the}} Confederacy. The Battle of Galveston was fought in Galveston Bay and island on January 1, 1863, when Confederate forces under Major General John B. Magruder attacked and expelled occupying Union troops from the city, which remained in Confederate hands for the duration of the war. In May 1865, the Lark successfully evaded the Union blockade off of Galveston Harbor and headed for Havana, becoming the final Confederate ship to slip through the blockade from any Southern port. In the late 1890s, the Fort Crockett defenses and coastal artillery batteries were constructed in Galveston and along the Bolivar Roads.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the report}} {{produced}} by the OIR, by 1957 the CIA realized that its version {{of the history of}} the Árbenz government and the coup were not gaining traction. Books written by defenders of the Árbenz government, which were strongly critical of the US intervention, were generally better received. Nationalist Latin Americans were inclined to view the Castillo Armas government as a creation of the <b>US.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, the US government decided to allow Ronald Schneider, a historian who was in the process of completing his Ph.D, to access the PBHistory archive. Scheider published Communism in Guatemala: 1944 to 1954 in 1959. Later observers have stated that the publication may have been subsidized in some way by the CIA: both the Foreign Policy Research Institute, where Schneider worked, and Frederick A. Praeger, who published Schneider's book, received CIA funds. Schneider stated in his book that the Comite was responsible for collecting the documents he accessed, but did not mention the CIA's role in funding the Comite, nor did he explain how the documents came to the US. Schneider's book did not rely on PBHistory material alone, but also on information that Schneider gathered during a trip to Mexico and Guatemala in 1957. The book was generally well received.|$|E
