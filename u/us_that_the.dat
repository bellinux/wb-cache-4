5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), {{but it is not clear}} why they did this before the arrival of the Spartans. There are two main theories to explain this.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians, doubting that a Persian {{commander}} {{would have}} sabotaged his own invasion, have suggested several other possible scenarios. It is, however, {{impossible to know}} exactly how the Naxians {{became aware of the}} invasion, but undoubtedly they were aware, and began to make preparations. Herodotus tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Naxians had previously had no inkling of the expedition, but that when news arrived they brought everything in from the fields, gathered enough food with which to survive a siege and reinforced their walls.|$|E
5|$|Having ruled {{himself out}} of the race when the news of Macmillan's illness broke, Home angered at least two of his cabinet colleagues by {{changing}} his mind. Macmillan quickly came to the view that Home would be the best choice as his successor, and gave him valuable behind-the-scenes backing. He {{let it be known that}} if he recovered he would be willing to serve as a member of a Home cabinet. He had earlier favoured Hailsham, but changed his mind when he learned from the British ambassador to the <b>US</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Hailsham as Prime Minister, and from his chief whip that Hailsham, seen as a right-winger, would alienate moderate voters.|$|E

5|$|The Greek forces were, {{as agreed}} by the Allied congress, under the overall command of Spartan royalty {{in the person of}} Pausanias, who was the regent for Leonidas' young son, Pleistarchus, his cousin. Diodorus tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Athenian {{contingent}} was under the command of Aristides; it is probable that the other contingents also had their leaders. Herodotus tells us in several places that the Greeks held council during the prelude to the battle, implying that decisions were consensual and that Pausanias did not have the authority to issue direct orders to the other contingents. This style of leadership contributed to the way events unfolded during the battle itself. For instance, in the period immediately before the battle, Pausanias was unable to order the Athenians to join up with his forces, and thus the Greeks fought the battle completely separated from each other.|$|E

25|$|This beta {{function}} tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> coupling {{increases with}} increasing energy scale, and QED becomes strongly coupled at high energy. In fact, the coupling apparently becomes infinite at some finite energy, {{resulting in a}} Landau pole. However, one cannot expect the perturbative beta function to give accurate results at strong coupling, {{and so it is}} likely that the Landau pole is an artifact of applying perturbation theory in a situation where it is no longer valid.|$|E
25|$|Although the Robertson–Seymour theorem extends {{these results}} to {{arbitrary}} minor-closed graph families, {{it is not}} a complete substitute for these results, because it does not provide an explicit description of the obstruction set for any family.

The complete set of forbidden minors for toroidal graphs remains unknown, but contains at least 16000 graphs.|$|E

25|$|However, {{in nature}} the {{electromagnetic}} field is coupled to charged particles, such as electrons. The QFT describing {{the interactions of}} photons and charged particles is quantum electrodynamics (QED), and this theory is not scale-invariant. We can see this from the QED beta-function. This tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> electric charge (which is the coupling parameter in the theory) increases with increasing energy. Therefore, while the quantized electromagnetic field without charged particles is scale-invariant, QED is not scale-invariant.|$|E
