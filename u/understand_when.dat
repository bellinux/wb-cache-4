25|$|Geobiochemistry {{is similar}} to biogeochemistry, but differs by placing {{emphasis}} {{on the effects of}} geology on the development of life’s biochemical processes, as distinct from the role of life on Earth’s cycles. Its primary goal is to link biological changes, encompassing evolutionary modifications of genes and changes in the expression of genes and proteins, to changes in the temperature, pressure, and composition of geochemical processes to <b>understand</b> <b>when</b> and how metabolism evolved. Geobiochemistry is founded on the notion that life is a planetary response because metabolic catalysis enables the release of energy trapped by a cooling planet.|$|E
25|$|Tourism in Singapore {{is a major}} {{industry}} and contributor to the Singaporean economy, attracting 16.4 million international tourists in 2016, about 3 times of Singapore's total population. It is also environmentally friendly, and maintains natural and heritage conservation programs. Along with this, it also {{has one of the}} world's lowest crime rates. As English is the dominant one of its four official languages, it is generally easier for tourists to <b>understand</b> <b>when</b> speaking to the local population of the country, for example, when shopping. Transport in Singapore exhaustively covers most, if not all public venues in Singapore, which increases convenience for tourists. This includes the well-known Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system.|$|E

25|$|Robots and {{artificial}} intelligences do not inherently contain or obey the Three Laws; their human creators must choose to program them in, and devise {{a means to}} do so. Robots already exist (for example, a Roomba) that are too simple to <b>understand</b> <b>when</b> they are causing pain or injury and know to stop. Many are constructed with physical safeguards such as bumpers, warning beepers, safety cages, or restricted-access zones to prevent accidents. Even the most complex robots currently produced are incapable of understanding and applying the Three Laws; significant advances in artificial intelligence {{would be needed to}} do so, and even if AI could reach human-level intelligence, the inherent ethical complexity as well as cultural/contextual dependency of the laws prevent them from being a good candidate to formulate robotics design constraints. However, as the complexity of robots has increased, so has interest in developing guidelines and safeguards for their operation.|$|E
25|$|The {{interpretation}} of facial expressions and mouthing {{can be difficult}} to <b>understand</b> <b>when</b> an individual has a visual impairment. Such problems hinder the ability of people to understand stimuli and translate information pertaining to perception with their brain for analysis. Non-verbal communication is important in effective communication and elders with vision loss are more likely to misinterpret or read the other person's actions in a wrong way. Visual impairments also cause a loss in positive perceptions of the environment around them. This can lead to isolation and possible depression in elderly people. Macular degeneration is a common cause of vision loss in elderly people. It diminishes the macula of the eye, which is responsible for clear vision. It causes progressive loss of central vision and possible loss of colour vision. This degeneration is caused by systemic changes in the circulation of waste products and growth of abnormal vessels around the retina causing the photoreceptors not to receive proper images. Though ageing almost always causes this, other possible effects and risk factors include smoking, obesity, family history and excessive sunlight exposure.|$|E
25|$|One of {{competing}} model for cpDNA replication asserts that most cpDNA is linear and participates in homologous recombination and replication structures similar to bacteriophage T4. It {{has been established}} that some plants have linear cpDNA, such as maize, and that more species still contain complex structures that scientists do not yet <b>understand.</b> <b>When</b> the original experiments on cpDNA were performed, scientists did notice linear structures; however, they attributed these linear forms to broken circles. If the branched and complex structures seen in cpDNA experiments are real and not artifacts of concatenated circular DNA or broken circles, then a D-loop mechanism of replication is insufficient to explain how those structures would replicate. At the same time, homologous recombination does not expand the multiple A --> G gradients seen in plastomes. Because of the failure to explain the deamination gradient {{as well as the}} numerous plant species that have been shown to have circular cpDNA, the predominant theory continues to hold that most cpDNA is circular and most likely replicates via a D loop mechanism.|$|E

500|$|When Cosby {{originally}} pitched The Cosby Show to NBC, it {{revolved around}} {{the life of a}} blue-collar couple; Clair was intended to be a plumber while the character's husband Cliff, portrayed by Cosby himself, was a limousine driver. Eventually, the idea of Clair working as a plumber was discarded and the character briefly became a Dominican housewife instead. Inspired by Ricky Ricardo from the sitcom I Love Lucy, of whom Cosby was a fan, much of the show's humor would have been directly derived from Clair's tendency to revert back to her native language Spanish when upset or agitated. Describing this concept as [...] "the reverse of [...] Lucy," [...] Cosby explained that the husband [...] "would be the person that didn’t <b>understand</b> <b>when</b> she spoke Spanish" [...] as opposed to the wife.|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} from The Hindu noted, [...] "The film {{takes off}} as a typical family drama. The {{first half of the}} film is intentionally slow-paced and shows to the audience the lighter moments in the family of Georgekutty. This half combines the elements of drama and comedy genres. The audience gets completely absorbed in the twist of events that begin to unfold {{from the end of the}} first half. The second half is more like a thriller and is about how the family, despite the vengeful villainy of a corrupt cop, stands its ground even as the law takes its course." [...] When asked whether this change in narrative style post-interval was intentional, Jeethu replied: [...] "I really don't <b>understand</b> <b>when</b> people say the first half lacked pace. A story or a film has its own way of progression and it does travel in a zig-zag away, capturing all the ups and downs of our lives. Right from the start if you accelerate the pace, sooner or later, the story-telling will lose its steam." ...|$|E

Hence Allen {{was not going to be}} part of it originally. However, she did appear on the video. The singer declared on her official blog that, I did a video shoot for the next single, which is Alfie, and that was quite a lot of fun, Alfie was played by a puppet and the whole thing looks like an episode of a mixture Tom and Jerry and Roger Rabbit, you'll <b>understand</b> <b>when</b> you see it. The whole day was a pleasurable experience [...] The video starts off with an opening title parodying Looney Tunes and shows Allen in the kitchen preparing a cup of tea, while Alfie, impersonated by a puppet, smokes in his miniature bedroom, watching television. The singer enters the room and takes away his bong, as he unsuccessfully tries to get it back. Next, Allen irons his tuxedo and marks a job announcement called [...] "The Puppet Show" [...] in the newspaper, as the lyric [...] "You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid" [...] is sung. Meanwhile, Alfie is in his bed, staring at a magazine in which there are undressed dolls, titled [...] "Roxy & Babs get it on!" [...] and proceeds to masturbate. Allen walks in on him with the newspaper and suit as he does so, but immediately exits out of embarrassment. With the start of the bridge, puppet birds sing outside the home, while Alfie sneaks out of his room and tries to get beer out of the refrigerator, but is ultimately caught by Allen. She then takes off his [...] "stupid fitted cap", as he scrawls a picture of her, which is also the cover of [...] "Littlest Things". The final scene happens at night, in the kitchen, where Allen is lying on the floor, watching her brother dance. After the last lyrics, [...] "Please don't despair, my dear, mon frere" [...] is sung, he punches her and the video ends.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first and}} only large {{passenger}} jet landed on 18 April 2016, a Boeing 737-800 operated by Comair. It was an implementation flight to test the route, ground operations and handling, ahead of commencement of scheduled services. [...] The landing was not straightforward, with the aircraft only successfully landing on its third attempt (the first attempt was a planned attempt {{only because of the}} lack of experience with this airport) On 26 April 2016, a further delay to the opening, without a specified end date, was announced by the St. Helena Government because of concerns regarding wind shear, after the problematic landing by the Comair 737-800 intended for regular flights. Only southbound landings (runway 20) have wind shear problems, not northbound. There is a need to define measurement methods for the wind shear in order to <b>understand</b> <b>when</b> landing can be done, and when to cancel flights. The late postponement caused extra cost, for example contracted employees and contracted airlines that cannot operate, hotels that were built, and also the need to extend the use of the RMS St Helena, which originally was due to be retired after the airport opened.|$|E
2500|$|A 1994 {{paper of}} Cannon gave a {{proof of the}} [...] "combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem" [...] that was {{motivated}} by the classic Riemann mapping theorem in complex analysis. The goal was to <b>understand</b> <b>when</b> an action of a group by homeomorphisms on a 2-sphere is (up to a topological conjugation) an action on the standard Riemann sphere by Möbius transformations. The [...] "combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem" [...] of Cannon gave a set of sufficient conditions when a sequence of finer and finer combinatorial subdivisions of a topological surface determine, in the appropriate sense and after passing to the limit, an actual conformal structure on that surface. This paper of Cannon led to an important conjecture, first explicitly formulated by Cannon and Swenson in 1998 (but also suggested in implicit form in Section 8 of Cannon's 1994 paper) and now known as Cannon's conjecture, regarding characterizing word-hyperbolic groups with the 2-sphere as the boundary. The conjecture (Conjecture 5.1 in [...] ) states that if the ideal boundary of a word-hyperbolic group G is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, then G admits a properly discontinuous cocompact isometric action on the hyperbolic 3-space (so that G is essentially a 3-dimensional Kleinian group). In analytic terms Cannon's conjecture is equivalent to saying that if the ideal boundary of a word-hyperbolic group G is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere then this boundary, with the visual metric coming from the Cayley graph of G, is quasisymmetric to the standard 2-sphere.|$|E

2500|$|Some basic conventions, such as (1) that animal/human homolog (ortholog) pairs {{differ in}} letter case (title case and all caps, respectively) and (2) that the symbol is {{italicized}} {{when referring to}} the gene but nonitalic when referring to the protein, are often not followed by contributors to public health journals. Many journals have the copyeditors restyle the casing and formatting to the extent feasible, although in complex genetics discussions only subject-matter experts (SMEs) can effortlessly parse them all. One example that illustrates the potential for ambiguity among non-SMEs is that some official gene names have the word [...] "protein" [...] within them, so the phrase [...] "brain protein I3 (BRI3)" [...] (referring to the gene) and [...] "brain protein I3 (BRI3)" [...] (referring to the protein) are both valid. The AMA Manual gives another example: both [...] "the TH gene" [...] and [...] "the TH gene" [...] can validly be parsed as correct ("the gene for tyrosine hydroxylase"), because the first mentions the alias (description) and the latter mentions the symbol. This seems confusing on the surface, although {{it is easier to}} <b>understand</b> <b>when</b> explained as follows: in this gene's case, as in many others, the alias (description) [...] "happens to use the same letter string" [...] that the symbol uses. (The matching of the letters is of course acronymic in origin and thus the phrase [...] "happens to" [...] implies more coincidence than is actually present; but phrasing it that way helps to make the explanation clearer.) There is no way for a non-SME to know this is the case for any particular letter string without looking up every gene from the manuscript in a database such as NCBI Gene, reviewing its symbol, name, and alias list, and doing some mental cross-referencing and double-checking (plus it helps to have biochemical knowledge). Most medical journals do not (in some cases cannot) pay for that level of fact-checking as part of their copyediting service level; therefore, it remains the author's responsibility. However, as pointed out earlier, many authors make little attempt to follow the letter case or italic guidelines; and regarding protein symbols, they often won't use the official symbol at all. For example, although the guidelines would call p53 protein [...] "TP53" [...] in humans or [...] "Tp53" [...] in rats, most authors call it [...] "p53" [...] in both (and even refuse to call it [...] "TP53" [...] if edits or queries try to), not least because of the biologic principle that many proteins are essentially or exactly the same molecules regardless of mammalian species. Regarding the gene, authors are usually willing to call it by its human-specific symbol and capitalization, TP53, and may even do so without being prompted by a query. But the end result of all these factors is that the published literature often does not follow the nomenclature guidelines completely.|$|E
