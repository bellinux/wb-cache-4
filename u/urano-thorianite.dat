40|$|AbstractSignificant {{amounts of}} spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuel are accumulating {{worldwide}} from decades of commercial nuclear power production. While such spent fuel {{is intended to}} be reprocessed or disposed in geologic repositories, out-of-reactor radiation damage from alpha decay can be detrimental to its structural stability. Here we report on an experimental study in which radiation damage in plutonium dioxide, uranium dioxide samples doped with short-lived alpha-emitters and <b>urano-thorianite</b> minerals have been characterized by XRD, transmission electron microscopy, thermal desorption spectrometry and hardness measurements to assess the long-term stability of spent nuclear fuel to substantial alpha-decay doses. Defect accumulation is predicted to result in swelling of the atomic structure and decrease in fracture toughness; whereas, the accumulation of helium will produce bubbles that result in much larger gaseous-induced swelling that substantially increases the stresses in the constrained spent fuel. Based on these results, the radiation-ageing of highly-aged spent nuclear fuel over more than 10, 000 years is predicted...|$|E
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to conventional fossil fuel, there is {{a renewed interest in}} the nuclear fuel to support increasing energy demand. New studies are then undertaken to characterize Madagascar U-Th bearing minerals. This is the case for the <b>urano-thorianite</b> bearing pyroxenites in the south East of Madagascar. In this region, several quarries were abandoned, after being mined by the French Atomic Energy Commission (C. E. A) in the fifties and sixties and are now explored by new mining companies. For this purpose, seven U-Th bearing mineral samples from old abandoned uranium quarries in Tranomaro, Amboasary Sud, Madagascar (46 28 ' 0 "E, 24 36 ' 0 "S), have been collected. To determine the mineral microstructure, they were investigated for qualitative and quantitative identification of crystalline compounds using X-ray powder diffraction analytical method (XRD). Results showed that the U and Th compounds, as minor elements, are present in various crystalline structures. This is important to understand their environmental behaviours, in terms of crystallographic dispersion of U-Th minerals and their impacts on human health. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCombining {{observation}} and simulation, radiohalos formed around <b>urano-thorianite</b> (UTh) from the Tranomaro granulitic skarns (SE-Madagascar) were studied. These structures consist of UTh grains surrounded by both aluminous diopside (Cpx) and calcite (Cc 1) crystals. Optical microscope and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images revealed (1) {{the presence of}} radiating cracks around the UTh probably due to swelling of the metamict UTh, (2) a diffuse optical halo at the Cc 1 /UTh interface, and (3) a wide "reaction zone" at the Cpx/UTh interface, composed of "secondary calcite" (Cc 2) with low temperature sheet silicate from the smectite (φ) group. Samples prepared across various interfaces using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) were investigated by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). In contrast to SEM observations, {{there is no direct}} contact between Cc 1 and UTh. From Cc 1 to UTh, we found: (1) a large (~ 200 - 300 nm) amorphous zone (A), enriched in U, Th and Ca, but without Si; (2) a chain (B) of very small (~ 20 nm) ThO 2 crystals; (3) another amorphous zone (C), which, in contrast to zone A is enriched in Si; and (4) another zone (D) made of small amorphous Si-rich "bubbles". The organization is similar for the UTh-Cc 2 interface. The presence of hydrous minerals (smectite) and carbonate (calcite) in reaction zone and in cracks, the presence of Pb-rich inclusions in secondary calcite, the abundance of fluid inclusions in the porous layer in calcite, the dissociation of U and Th in the calcite-uranothorianite layer, and the ThO 2 chains along interfaces, are strong indications that low-temperature crystallization was promoted by a fluid phase. SRIM simulation was used to calculate the effect of α and recoil particles of the three decay chains, in Cpx, Cc and UTh. The thickness of the damaged area calculated for α in Cpx and Cc are similar to the widths of the recrystallized areas observed in thin section (~ 30 µm). Corrected with the ''wandering recoil effect'', the size of the damaged area calculated for recoil nuclei in Cc (~ 50 - 60 nm) is ~multiplied by 3 and is in rather good agreement with the thickness of the totally amorphous layer at the Cc-UTh interface (~ 200 nm). Finally, it is emphasized that radiohalos are a point of chemical and physical weakness in a rock and probably a starting point for alteration...|$|E
