40|$|Summary. <b>Uvarovite</b> and its {{relationships}} with grossular and andradite {{have been studied}} {{in order to understand}} better the geochemistry of <b>uvarovite.</b> Syn-these have been carried out under both dry and hydrothermal conditions; a solid solution with grossular was obtained under both conditions, but with andradite only under hydrothermal conditions. The results are discussed in relation to the chemistry of <b>uvarovite.</b> ItaE mineral <b>uvarovite,</b> which is the rarest of the common garnets, never been reported as a pure end-member, but usually as a solid solution with grossular, or most commonly with andradite. The ideal <b>uvarovite</b> should contain 30. 38 % Cr 20 ~, but chemical analyses of a number of specimens (see fig. 1) show that the Cr~Oa content may vary from 3 " 39 to 27 " 54 %. There appears to be a gap in the range of Cr 20 ~ composition from approximately 15 to 22 % (Deer, Howie, and Zussman, 1962), but this gap may be just the result of insufficient numbers of analyses. <b>Uvarovite</b> has generally been found associated with serpentinite, chromite, metamorphic limestones, and skarn ore-bodies; it has formed from contact metamorphic processes or hydrothermal processes. In the Bushveld area, grossular and <b>uvarovite</b> are rarely associated with each other, although the <b>uvarovite</b> is usually a solid solution with grossular (Frankel, 1959). Chemical analyses show that there is considerable divergence from the ideal molecular atio of 3 : 1 : 3, with an excess of the CaO component. Frankel postulated an accommodation of the excess CaO group in 'cavit ies ' within the unit cell and concluded that the garnet therefore is elastic. He further noted that compositional discrepancies occurred in those garnets that contained much TiO ~ or FeO, with iron in the structure producing marked non-linear change in cell-size between grossular and <b>uvarovite</b> in the solid-solution series.

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Uvarovite</b> and grossular, {{the former}} com-paratively rare, occur along the serpentinite-graphite schist contact in the Fengtien area, {{on the eastern}} slope of the Central Range of Taiwan. <b>Uvarovite</b> occurs as small emerald-green {{euhedral}} crystals on diopside-fels with dodecahedral crystal forms and many other modifica-tions. Its refractive index is 1. 782, specific gravity 3. 702, and unit cell edge 11. 912 A. Chemical and probe analyses give average Cr 20 3 contents of 11. 60 wt. ~; spectro-graphic analysis shows significant enrichment in Cr, Be, Co, Y, Sb, and La over grossular. Associated minerals include nephrite, diopside, tremolite asbestos, zoisite, and clinozoisite. Grossular is reddish-brown; large crystals, dodecahedral in form often modified by trapezohedrons, are associated with diopside, idocrase, and calcite, n = 1. 746, SG = 3. 636, and a = 11. 866 A. Structurally and chemically it is quite near the grossular end member. Grossular {{is considered to be}} formed from pneumatolysis associated with the intrusion of ultramafic rocks, whereas <b>uvarovite</b> is a replacement product of relict chromite in the original ultramafic rocks where migration of elements such as silicon and calcium from wall rocks are prominent. <b>UVAROVITE</b> {{is a member of the}} ugrandite series and is the rarest of the six end members of the garnet family. The pure <b>uvarovite</b> nd member has not been recorded in natural minerals; in fact the natural garnet that has been called 'uvarovite' always contain a considerable amount of the grossular and andradite molecule. Garnets with <b>uvarovite</b> as the dominant molecule are of restricted occurrence and are found chiefly in serpentinite, often in association with chromite (Chakraborty, 1968), and in metamorphosed limestones and skarn ore-bodies (Deer et al., 1963).

40|$|Gem garnet {{chemistry}} is described using the end-members pyrope, almandine, spessartine, andradite, grossular, and <b>uvarovite.</b> The large variation in garnets makes classification difficult. Garnet gemstones are typically classified {{by means of}} their refractive indices, together with specific gravity. However, the range of refractive indices for gem garnets can be restrictive and unreliable in gemstone classification. Chemical classification is generally the most accurate means of classification and {{was used in this}} thesis by means of a portable XRF for the non-destructive chemical analyses of 1513 garnet gemstones. Colour, refractive index and magnetic susceptibility were also determined. The garnets were divided into two species: ugrandite (<b>uvarovite,</b> grossular and andradite) and pyralspite (pyrope, spessartine and almandine). The chemistry of the pyralspite species was very diverse with a large range in end-member proportions producing extensive solid solutions between end-members. A diverse range in colour, refractive index, and magnetic susceptibility was also observed in the pyralspite species. However, no distinction based on refractive index and magnetic susceptibility could be made in the pyralspite species. Distinctive chemistries were observed in the ugrandite species, which correlates with the magnetic susceptibility and refractive index. Colour was the exception as no relationship between colour and chemistry was observed. The samples with unusual compositions were reported such as pyrope-andradite, spessartine-grossular, and almandine-grossular. This study concluded that refractive index, magnetic susceptibility and colour should not be used in isolation because this can lead to misinterpretation. Rather, analytical techniques, if available, should be used. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. GeologyUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|Ru–Os–Ir alloys {{have been}} found in two podiform chromitites located at the Chiroro and Bankei mines in the Sarugawa {{peridotite}} complex in the Kamuikotan zone, Hokkaido, Japan. This is the first report on the occurrence of PGM (= platinum-group minerals) from chromitites in Japan. The Ru–Os–Ir alloys most typically form polyhedra associated with other minerals (Ni–Fe alloys and heazlewoodite) in chromian spinel. The PGM are possibly pseudomorphs after some primary PGM such as laurite and are chemically highly inhomogeneous, indicating a low-temperature alteration origin. This is consistent with intense alteration (formation of serpentine, <b>uvarovite</b> and kmmererite) imposed on the Kamuikotan chromitites. High-temperature primary PGE (platinum–group elements) –bearing sulfides were possibly recrystallized at low temperatures into a new assemblage of PGM, Ni-Fe alloys and sulfides. Placer PGM around the peridotite complexes are chemically different from the PGM in dunite and chromitite possibly due to the, as yet, incomplete search for the rock-hosted PGM. The PGE content in chromitites is distinctly higher in those in the Kamuikotan zone than in those in the Sangun zone of Southwest Japan, consistent with the more refractory nature (Cr# of spinel, up to 0. 8) of the former than the latter (Cr# of spinel, 0. 5) ...|$|E

The potential of glaze on-site analyses as a classification/datating tool is evaluated. The structure of the silicate glaze does not change with the sample (index of polymerisation ~ 0. 5 - 0. 8, indicating a lead silicate composition; characteristic Si-O stretching mode doublet at ~ 985 and 1030 - 1050 cm- 1). By contrast the corresponding signature of most of the “Kütahya” wares peaks at ~ 1070 - 1090 cm- 1.

The different crystalline phases identified in the glaze are Α-quartz, haematite, spinel, cassiterite, <b>uvarovite</b> garnet and zircon. White colour arises from Α-quartz slip in most samples studied. Cassiterite (SnO 2) opacifier is only present in some early blue-and-white ceramics (Master of the Knots and Baba Nakkas style, ca. 1510 - 1530) and we do not have other evidence of its intentional use as an opacifier.

However, although the synthesis of knorringite is reported in the literature (Ringwood 1977; Irifune et al. 1982; Taran et al. 2004), the structure of the pure end-member has not been yet determined from experimental data. In this study, the crystal structure of knorringite, Mg 3 Cr 2 (SiO 4) 3, has been refined from high resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data recorded under ambient conditions on a polycrystalline sample synthesized at 12 GPa in a multi-anvil apparatus. The structure is cubic, space group Ia- 3 d, a = 11. 5935 (1), V = 1558. 27 (4) Å 3, dcalc = 3. 97 g. cm- 3. The Cr-O distance of 1. 957 (2) Å is consistent with EXAFS results on the same sample. This short distance indicates a substantial compression of the CrO 6 octahedron, compared to ambient pressure Cr 3 +-minerals such as <b>uvarovite</b> (= 1. 99 Å, Andrut and Wildner 2002).

The 17 IR active F 1 u transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) frequencies, the oscillator strengths, the high frequency and static dielectric constants, and the reflectance spectrum were computed. The agreement with experiments for the TO and LO peaks is always excellent, the mean absolute difference for the whole set of data (overall 178 peaks) being 5 cm− 1. Oscillator strengths, calculated from the mass-weighted effective Born charges, are found in semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental data. The reflectance spectra, simulated through the classical dispersion relation, reproduce the experimental curves extremely well. The availability of the full set of simulated frequencies and intensities, obtained by using uniform computational tools (computer code, variational basis sets, density functional), permits the establishment of correlations between IR wavenumbers and structural features suggested, but only partially documented, in the past...|$|E

Pyrope samples from the Podsedice deposit range in colour from the prevalent red pyrope with a brownish hue to the rare dark violet Cr-rich pyrope. Electron microprobe analyses of the red pyrope show a consistent content (mol%) of 74. 3 - 75. 1 pyrope, 12. 5 - 13. 7 almandine, 4. 3 - 7. 2 <b>uvarovite,</b> 1. 1 - 4. 0 grossular, and 0. 7 - 0. 8 spessartine.

Both types of pyrope are nearly free of compositional zoning. Pargasitic amphibole, Al-Cr spinel, and iron-nickel sulphide are for the first time identified as minor inclusions in the Bohemian garnet. Pargasite forms sub-oval inclusions, 30 to 60 µm long. The Ca contents in pargasite are notably lower than in ordinary calciferous amphiboles (~ 1. 6 Ca pfu), and the increased Na content indicates approximately 20 mol% of the magnesiotaramite end-member in the amphibole solid solution. The pargasite inclusions provide important petrologic and geotectonic information on the metamorphic state of the ultramafic host-rock prior to garnet crystallization. The red and violet garnets considered in this study generally contain a very limited amount of microscopic inclusions and impurities.

40|$|Garnet-melt {{trace element}} {{partitioning}} experiments were {{performed in the}} system FeO-CaO-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 (FCMAS) at 3 GPa and 1540 °C, aimed specifically at studying the effect of garnet Fe 2 + content on partition coefficients (D(Grt/Melt)). D(Grt/Melt), measured by SIMS, for trivalent elements entering the garnet X-site show a small but significant dependence on garnet almandine content. This dependence is rationalised using the lattice strain model of Blundy and Wood [Blundy, J. D., Wood, B. J., 1994. Prediction of crystal-melt partition coefficients from elastic moduli. Nature 372, 452 - 454], which describes partitioning of an element i with radius r(i) and valency Z in terms of three parameters: the effective radius of the site r 0 (Z), the strain-free partition coefficient D 0 (Z) for a cation with radius r 0 (Z), and the apparent compressibility of the garnet X-site given by its Young's modulus E(X) (Z). Combination of these results with data in Fe-free systems [Van Westrenen, W., Blundy, J. D., Wood, B. J., 1999. Crystal-chemical controls on trace element partitioning between garnet and anhydrous silicate melt. Am. Mineral. 84, 838 - 847] and crystal structure data for spessartine, andradite, and <b>uvarovite,</b> leads to the following equations for r 0 (3 +) and E(X) (3 +) {{as a function of}} garnet composition (X) and pressure (P) : r 0 (3 +) [Å] = 0. 930 X(Py) + 0. 993 X(Gr) + 0. 916 X(Alm) + 0. 946 X(Spes) + 1. 05 (X(And) +X(Uv)) - 0. 005 (P[GPa] - 3. 0) (± 0. 005 Å) E(x) (3 +) [GPa] = 3. 5 x 1012 (1. 38 + r 0 (3 +) [Å]) - 26. 7 (± 30 GPa) Accuracy of these equations is shown by application to the existing garnet-melt partitioning database, covering a wide range of P and T conditions (1. 8 GPa < P < 5. 0 GPa; 975 °C < T < 1640 °C). D(Grt/Melt) for all 3 + elements entering the X-site (REE, Sc and Y) are predicted to within 10 - 40 % at given, P, T, and X, when D(Grt/Melt) for just one of these elements is known. In the absence of such knowledge, relative element fractionation (e. g. D(Sm) (Grt/Melt) /D(Nd) (Grt/Melt)) can be predicted. As an example, we predict that during partial melting of garnet peridotite, group A eclogite, and garnet pyroxenite, r 0 (3 +) for garnets ranges from 0. 939 ± 0. 005 to 0. 953 ± 0. 009 Å. These values are consistently smaller than the ionic radius of the heaviest REE, Lu. The above equations quantify the crystal-chemical controls on garnet-melt partitioning for the REE, Y and Sc. As such, they represent a major advance en route to predicting D(Grt/Melt) for these elements as a function of P, T and X. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
