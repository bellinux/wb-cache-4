5|$|The {{birth of}} Prithu is without female intervention. Thus being a ayonija ("born without (the participation) of the yoni"), Prithu is <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> desire and ego and can thus control his senses to rule dutifully {{upholding}} Dharma.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the American landmass, {{which had}} been conquered by {{military}} force by Spain and Portugal, European missionaries encountered in Asia united, literate societies that were as yet <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> European influence or national endeavour.|$|E
5|$|The {{site where}} the bones were found was largely <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> paleontologists until around 1990, when {{excavations}} restarted. Remains of other dinosaurs, fish, turtles, and plants have also been found, including teeth belonging {{to a member of}} the Tyrannosauroidea. Other parts of H. missouriensis, including dental remains and part of a jaw, have also been found. The variety of faunal remnants found at the Chronister site suggest that a large body of water once existed close to the area.|$|E
50|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Veer-Zaara was {{released}} on CD, LP record and specially on Audio DVD. The music is based on old and <b>untouched</b> compositions <b>by</b> the late Madan Mohan, as revised by his son Sanjeev Kohli.|$|R
50|$|The legend {{states that}} Vyaghrapada was a rishi {{and he was}} {{entrusted}} {{with the task of}} picking up fresh flowers, <b>untouched</b> even <b>by</b> the honeybees, for offering to Shiva in his aspect as Nataraja in the temple complex of Chidambaram, located in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. While plucking the flowers, Vyaghrapada would get wounded on account of thorns and the rough surface. Shiva conferred on him feet of tigers and this ended the sage’s miseries. So armed with the tiger’s feet, the sage easily moved from place to place, including climbing rough trees to pluck fresh flowers <b>untouched</b> even <b>by</b> the honey bees.|$|R
50|$|It is best {{planted in}} September or March. The iris is <b>untouched</b> or {{undamaged}} <b>by</b> slugs.|$|R
5|$|Warburton was {{predominantly}} a farming village {{during the}} medieval period. The north western {{corner of the}} township {{was used as a}} deer park. Warburton grew as an agricultural town during the medieval period, and it remained almost <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> the Industrial Revolution; this is reflected in the population change between 1801 and 1901, dropping from 466 to 403, with little variation {{at a time when the}} rest of Trafford was expanding rapidly.|$|E
5|$|An equestrian {{statue of}} the General was erected in Boulogne-sur-Mer; the statue was inaugurated on October 24, 1909, at a {{ceremony}} attended by several units from the Argentine military. The statue was erected through purely private initiative, {{with the support of}} national government of Argentina, the municipal council of Buenos Aires and a public funding campaign. The statue is 10m high, on a 4m by 6m base; it is well known to locals. Located on the beach, it was virtually <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> the numerous bombings campaigns during both world wars.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 53 {{begins with}} Gangleri asking {{if any of}} the gods will survive, and if there will be {{anything}} left of the earth or the sky. High responds that the earth will appear once more from the sea, beautiful and green, where self-sown crops grow. The field Iðavöllr exists where Asgard once was, and, there, <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> Surtr's flames, Víðarr and Váli reside. Now possessing their father's hammer Mjölnir, Thor's sons Móði and Magni will meet them there, and, coming from Hel, Baldr and Höðr also arrive. Together, they all sit and recount memories, later finding the gold game pieces the Æsir once owned. Völuspá stanza 51 is then quoted.|$|E
2500|$|Muslims {{believe that}} Quran, {{as it is}} {{presented}} today, is complete and <b>untouched,</b> supported <b>by</b> their faith in quranic verses such as [...] "We [...] have, without doubt, sent down the Reminder and We will assuredly guard it [...] " [...] (Quran 15:9).|$|R

5|$|Columbia's {{infrastructure}} {{was relatively}} <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> the Civil War. Missouri, {{as a slave}} state, had Southern sympathies, but remained in the Union. The majority {{of the city was}} pro-Union, however, the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-Confederate. Because of this, the University of Missouri became a base from which Union troops operated. No battles were fought within the city because the presence of Union troops dissuaded Confederate guerrillas from attacking, though several major battles occurred at nearby Boonville and Centralia. After the Civil War, race relations in Columbia followed the Southern pattern; George Burke, a black man, was lynched in 1889.|$|E
5|$|Filmmakers {{also made}} feature-length documentaries {{that covered the}} dark {{recesses}} of the globe, including the Amazon rainforest, Native American settlements, the Pacific islands, and everywhere in between. Taking advantage of audiences' voyeuristic impulses, aided by the allowance of nudity in tribal documentaries, the filming of lands <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> modernity, and the presentation of locales never before filmed, these movies placated Depression era American audiences by showing them lifestyles more difficult than their own. Also captured were Arctic expeditions in films such 90° South and With Byrd at the South Pole, and Sub-Saharan Africa in the safari films of Martin and Osa Johnson, among others.|$|E
5|$|Habitat destruction, such as forest {{clearing}} {{for commercial}} logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, {{is the most}} detrimental activity {{on the distribution of}} these rabbits. Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, they do not thrive in only mature forests <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> destruction, yet they do not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status.|$|E

5000|$|Following the Final Recess, the {{scattered}} estates of approximately 300 free Imperial Knights and 99 Imperial Counts, totaling perhaps 4,500 square miles, should have remained <b>untouched.</b> But <b>by</b> {{the winter of}} 1803, the rulers of Bavaria, Hesse-Kassel, and Württemberg began to take possession of these tiny enclaves {{through a combination of}} Surrender and Transfer Edicts (Abtretungs- und Überweisungspatenten) and military force. Other smaller rulers, such as the Prince of Leiningen, followed suit. This {{came to be known as}} the Rittersturm.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, the division's headquarters, {{along with}} the 1st Brigade, {{returned}} to Afghanistan. During that time, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the country}} such as Paktika Province, going places previously <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> the war in search of Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote regions of the country to interact directly with the population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.|$|E
5|$|In summer 2003, the TF Warrior {{returned}} to Afghanistan, relieving TF Devil from the 82nd Airborne Division for Operation Enduring Freedom IV. For more than 6 months, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the}} country such as Paktika Province, going places previously <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> the war in search of Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote {{regions of the country}} to interact directly with the population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.|$|E
5|$|Later {{many other}} Sicilian {{towns and cities}} which had been either little damaged or {{completely}} <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> the quake, such as Palermo, were also transformed by the Baroque style, as the fashion spread and aristocrats with a palazzo in Catania came to wish their palazzo in the capital to be as opulent as that in the second city. In Palermo the , began in 1566, {{was one of many}} in the city to be redecorated inside in the 18th century in the Baroque style, with coloured marbles.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{the words}} {{continued}} to have a meaning that was <b>untouched</b> either <b>by</b> the knowledge of gateways or hyperboles. The historical, or local, or psychological interest in the words was another thing. There remained unaltered the inexplicable value of the saying. What was this relation between a needle's eye, a rich man, and heaven? What sort of a needle's eye, what sort of a rich man, what sort of heaven? Who knows? It means the Absolute World, and can never be more than half interpreted {{in terms of the}} relative world.|$|R
60|$|There was a rapid {{discharge}} of their carbines, but men at full gallop make but poor shooting. Ralph {{felt he was}} <b>untouched</b> but, <b>by</b> the convulsive spring which his horse gave, he knew the animal was wounded. For {{a couple of hundred}} yards, there was but little difference in his speed; and then Ralph--to his dismay--felt him flag, and knew that the wound had been a severe one. Another hundred yards, and the animal staggered; and would have fallen, had not Ralph held him up well, with knee and bridle.|$|R
25|$|The Sentinelese (also {{called the}} Sentineli or North Sentinel Islanders) are the {{indigenous}} people of North Sentinel Island in the Andaman Islands of India. One of the Andamanese peoples, they resist {{contact with the outside}} world, and are among the last people to remain virtually <b>untouched</b> and uncontacted <b>by</b> modern civilisation.|$|R
5|$|Sangay {{is one of}} two active volcanoes {{located within}} the namesake Sangay National Park, the other being Tungurahua to the north. As such it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983. The area's {{isolation}} has allowed it to maintain a pristine ecology relatively <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> human interaction, and the park hosts a biome ranging from alpine glaciers on the volcanoes' peaks to tropical forest on their flanks. Altitude and rainfall are the most significant local factors affecting fauna, and therefore the most lush ecosystems are found on the wetter parts of the volcano's eastern slope.|$|E
5|$|The English Civil War {{affected}} all of England; even {{families were}} split over Royalist or Parliamentarian loyalties. Little is recorded over the divisions within Hale Barns, but Hale and Hale Barns did {{emerge from the}} Civil War more or less <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> events– {{though there was a}} heavy tax to pay to support the Parliamentarian army they avoided much of the requisitioning of supplies and animals for passing armies. None of the Royalists in Hale and Hale Barns had their lands confiscated or was forced to pay fines.|$|E
5|$|The Old Crow Flats and basin {{was one of}} {{the areas}} in Canada <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> glaciations during the Pleistocene Ice ages, thus it served as a pathway and refuge for ice age plants and animals. The area holds {{evidence}} of early human habitation in Canada dating from about 12,000. Fossils from the area include some never accounted for in North America, such as hyenas and large camels. Bluefish Caves is an archaeological site in Yukon, Canada from which a specimen of apparently human-worked mammoth bone has been radiocarbon dated to 12,000 years ago.|$|E

It is the first certified piece of PAN Parks Wilderness in Finland with the ambition to protect fragments of unlogged boreal forest from intensive reindeer herding.’ (PAN Parks 2010).|$|R
500|$|Inside {{some of the}} houses, Bathurst writes, {{everyday}} objects {{still remain}} where they were left decades ago; [...] "the bed and the limed matchboard ceiling are intact, <b>untouched</b> even <b>by</b> the damp. The kitchen table still stands in the parlour and a framed and fading photograph gazes out {{from the top of}} the mantelpiece." [...] In another house seen 20 years earlier by Leslie Thomas, [...] "was a rank of family photographs, shades in Victorian dress staring out forever into a room now desolate and holed, but which had once held the life of a warm family." ...|$|R
50|$|From {{the mid-1970s}} {{to the late}} 1980s, the premiership of Bjelke-Petersen {{remained}} largely unchanged. The premier was generally <b>untouched</b> politically <b>by</b> allegations of corruption against him and the Queensland government. Brisbane’s music scene is viewed as having been affected both positively and negatively by the political environment. However, it cannot be suggested that a conservative political environment by itself produces a great music scene. Another important influence of Brisbane’s music scene in the 1970s and 1980s was the music coming out of Britain and America at that time, particularly bands such as the Sex Pistols and The Stooges.|$|R
5|$|The {{closure of}} the border region for nearly 40years created a haven for {{wildlife}} in some places. Although parts of the East German {{side of the border}} were farmed, intensive farming of the kind practised elsewhere in Germany was absent and large areas were <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> agriculture. Conservationists became aware as early as the 1970s that the border had become a refuge for rare species of animals and plants. Their findings led the Bavarian government to begin a programme of buying land along the border to ensure its protection from development.|$|E
5|$|The forest {{contains}} {{four areas}} of pristine wilderness that have remained largely <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> human {{activities such as}} mining, logging, and road and building construction. The four regions include the North Absaroka, Washakie, Fitzpatrick and Popo Agie Wildernesses. Additionally, {{a small portion of}} the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness extends into the extreme northwestern part of the forest, along the Montana border. In Shoshone National Forest, , constituting 56percent of the forest is designated wilderness. The wilderness designation provides a much higher level of land protection and prohibits any alterations by man to the resource.|$|E
5|$|Before the 20th century, Torajans {{lived in}} {{autonomous}} villages, where they practised animism and were relatively <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> the outside world. In the early 1900s, Dutch missionaries first worked to convert Torajan highlanders to Christianity. When the Tana Toraja regency was further {{opened to the}} outside world in the 1970s, it became an icon of tourism in Indonesia: it was exploited by tourism development and studied by anthropologists. By the 1990s, when tourism peaked, Toraja society had changed significantly, from an agrarian model—in which social life and customs were outgrowths of the Aluk To Dolo—to a largely Christian society. Today, tourism and remittances from migrant Torajans have made for major changes in the Toraja highland, giving the Toraja a celebrity status within Indonesia and enhancing Toraja ethnic group pride.|$|E
60|$|He {{said all}} this in a distracted way, with his eyes going about the garden for the {{possible}} apparition of Sir Isaac, {{and all the time}} his sense of possible observers made him assume an attitude as though he was engaged in the smallest of small talk. Her colour quickened at the import of his words, and emotion, very rich and abundant emotion, its various factors not altogether <b>untouched</b> perhaps <b>by</b> the spirit of laughter, lit her eyes. She doubted a little what he was saying and yet she had anticipated that somehow, some day, in quite other circumstances, Mr. Brumley might break into some such strain.|$|R
60|$|The late Stephen Hurd {{had been}} a methodical man. Every one of those many packets of {{foolscap}} and parchment bore in the left-hand corner near the top a few carefully written words summarizing their contents. It {{was clear from the}} first that Wilhelmina had undertaken not an examination but a search. Mortgages, leases, agreements, she left unopened and <b>untouched.</b> One <b>by</b> one she passed them back to the young man who handed them out to her, for replacement. In the end she had retained one small packet of letters only, on the outside of which were simply the initials P. N. These she held for a moment thoughtfully in her hand.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Corporation {{work piece}} length measure {{system based on}} digital image {{processing}} technology. CCD vidicon is used as the image capture equipment. Image signal are converted into 8 bits digital code stream by CMOS image sensor chip OV 9650. DSP chip of TI is used as the core of image processing in the scheme. Peripheral SDRAM are expanded through peripheral bus to save the large amounts of temporary data in data processing to reduce the time for image processing. Median filtering is adopted in image enhance of the object image. The length of rectangle work piece {{can be measured in}} the distance <b>by</b> <b>untouched</b> way <b>by</b> improved edge recognition algorithm in real time. The measurement result is displayed by LCD. Meanwhile the measure system communicates with PC through communication interface. It has been proved that the system can guarantee real-time and high accurate. It’s a typical instance of DSP and digital image processing technology used in industry. In the process of old industrial production, it depends on man-measurement method and the length of work piece on the product line is recorded manual one by one if the conditions permit. The speed of man-measurement method is slow, as while as it has low precision because o...|$|R
