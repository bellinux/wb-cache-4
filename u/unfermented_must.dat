5000|$|Among the {{components}} influencing how sweet a wine will taste is residual sugar. It is usually measured in grams of sugar per litre of wine, often abbreviated to g/l or g/L.

Süssreserve allows winemakers to fully ferment the wine without having to worry about stopping fermentation before all the sugar has gone. Since sulphites are used to stop fermentation, this technique reduces the usage of sulphites. Süssreserve is used by other makers of German-style wines, particularly in New Zealand.|$|E

5000|$|The {{length of}} time that the pomace stays in the juice is {{critical}} for the final character of the wine. When the winemaker judges {{the time to be}} right, the juice is drained off the pomace, which is then pressed to extract the juice retained by the matrix. Yeast is added to the juice to begin the fermentation, while the pomace is often returned to the vineyard or orchard to be used as fertilizer. A portion of selected <b>unfermented</b> <b>must</b> may be kept as Süssreserve, to be added prior to bottling as a sweetening component. Some winemakers create a second batch of wine from the used pomace by adding a quantity of water equivalent to the juice removed, letting the mixture sit for 24 hours, and draining off the liquid. This wine may be used as a drink for the employees of the winemaker or as a basis for some pomace brandies. Grappa, however, by law, must be produced only from the pomace solids, with no water added.The must can be used also for Balsamic Vinegar production, the special vinegar from Modena (Italy): for the acetification is use a selected bacterial colonies or the lenta in superficie (slow surface) or lenta [...] "a truciolo" [...] (slow wood shavings) methods and then there is a maturation phase. Both the acetification and maturation take place in precious sessile oak, chestnut, oak, mulberry and juniper barrels. The minimum maturation time is 60 days and after this period a group of expert technicians test analytic and organoleptic resulting product.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, {{there have}} been two main types of vermouth: sweet and dry. Responding to demand and competition, vermouth {{manufacturers}} have created additional styles, including extra-dry white, sweet white (bianco), red, amber (ambre or rosso), and rosé. [...] Vermouth is produced by starting with a base of a neutral grape wine or <b>unfermented</b> wine <b>must.</b> Each manufacturer adds additional alcohol and a proprietary mixture of dry ingredients, consisting of aromatic herbs, roots, and barks, to the base wine, base wine plus spirit or spirit only - which may be redistilled before adding to the wine or <b>unfermented</b> wine <b>must.</b> After the wine is aromatized and fortified, the vermouth is sweetened with either cane sugar or caramelized sugar, depending on the style. Italian and French companies produce most of the vermouth consumed throughout the world, although the United States and the United Kingdom are also producers.|$|R
50|$|Pommeau is made {{by mixing}} two thirds apple <b>must</b> (<b>unfermented</b> apple juice) to one third of one-year-old Calvados. The {{proportions}} are chosen {{to ensure that the}} resulting mixture has 16-18% alcohol by volume.|$|R
50|$|Fructose, {{along with}} glucose, {{is one of}} the {{principal}} sugars involved in the creation of wine. At time of harvest, there is usually an equal amount of glucose and fructose molecules in the grape; however, as the grape over ripens the level of fructose will become higher. In wine, fructose can taste nearly twice as sweet as glucose and is a key component in the creation of sweet dessert wines. During fermentation, glucose is consumed first by the yeast and converted into alcohol. A winemaker that chooses to halt fermentation (either by temperature control or the addition of brandy spirits in the process of fortification) will be left with a wine that is high in fructose and notable residual sugars. The technique of süssreserve, where <b>unfermented</b> grape <b>must</b> is added after the wine's fermentation is complete, will result in a wine that tastes less sweet than a wine whose fermentation was halted. This is because the <b>unfermented</b> grape <b>must</b> will still have roughly equal parts of fructose and the less sweet tasting glucose. Similarly, the process of chaptalization where sucrose (which is one part glucose and one part fructose) is added will usually not increase the sweetness level of the wine.|$|R
40|$|The oenological {{interest}} in the autochthonous yeast applications has increased since they represents an important supplement to wine quality (Martinez et al. 1989; Moreno et al. 1991). Yeast populations harboured {{onto the surface of}} berries and in musts of “Grillo” grape variety were isolated and analyzed. In order to obtain a first blastomycetic mapping of Marsala wine production area, eight vineyards were chosen on the basis of different climatic and agronomic parameters, including altitude, exposure,vineyard age, grape biotype, grape cultivation system, vegetative vigour, pruning, green pruning, yield per plant, phytosanity state, irrigation and closeness to wood areas. Analysis of blastomycetic populations was performed by cell counts on specific culture media for yeasts. Cell concentrations were evaluated on grapes and <b>unfermented</b> <b>musts</b> and during spontaneous must micro-fermentations at different times (after 3 and 13 days). Furthermore, during micro-fermentations non-Saccharomyces populations were distinguished from presumptive Saccharomyces based on the appearance of colonies after growth onto Wallerstein Laboratory (WL) nutrient agar (Pallman et al. 2001). Non-Saccharomyces reached about 106 - 107 CFU/ml both at the third and at the thirteenth day, while Saccharomyces exhibited variable cell concentrations, in particular, the majority of experiments showed level around 104 CFU/ml at the third day and almost all samples reached level of about 106 CFU/ml at the thirteen day. Saccharomyces cell concentrations positively correlated with weight loss registered during fermentations, since higher weight loss values were found in samples with their higher levels. After colony morphology inspection, 54 isolates were collected from grapes and <b>unfermented</b> <b>musts</b> and 60 during must micro-fermentations after 3 and 13 days, forming a total of 114 isolates. They were clustered into eight groups and into nine groups by optical microscopic observation of cell morphologies. Strain typing and differentiation was carried out by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR) (Moschetti et al. 1998) and the band patterns were analyzed by means of the unweighted pair group method using arithmetic average clustering algorithm (UPGMA). The representative strains of each group are being genetically identified. So far, analysis of D 1 /D 2 region of the 26 S rRNA gene revealed the presence of Candida zampliinina, Hanseniaspora uvarum, Issatchenkia terricola, Metschnikovia pulkerrima, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zygosaccharomyces bailii. Moreover, the study was specifically oriented to the Saccharomyces spp. strains, which were isolated from musts fermented for 21 days using a “modified ethanol sulphite agar” (MESA), prepared from ESY medium. A total of 42 cultures were collected and 28 presumptive Saccharomyces yeasts, as selected by microscopic observation, were confirmed to be Saccharomyces spp. through amplification of ITS- 5. 8 S rRNA region (Esteve-Zarzoso et al. 1999). All the isolates were typed as above reported. The representative strains of each group were characterized for technological traits with {{interest in}} wine production such as hydrogen sulphide production, ethanol tolerance and potassium metabisulphide resistance. Strains showing the best performance were used to carry out “Grillo” must micro-fermentations lasting 13 days to select yeast starter cultures. The work is still in progress...|$|R
5000|$|Süssreserve (Süßreserve, {{literally}} meaning [...] "sweet reserve") is a wine term {{referring to}} a portion of selected <b>unfermented</b> grape <b>must,</b> free of microorganisms, {{to be added to}} wine as a sweetening component. This technique was developed in Germany and is used with German-style wines such as semi-sweet Riesling or Müller-Thurgau. [...] The technique not only raises the sugar level of the wine, but also lowers the amount of alcohol. Under German law, no more than fifteen percent of the final wine's volume may be the reserved juice. This practice is allowed also for Prädikatswein, the highest level in the German wine classification. It is often used for semi-sweet Kabinett and Spätlese, but more rarely for Auslese and upward.|$|R
40|$|While <b>unfermented</b> grape <b>must</b> {{contains}} {{approximately equal}} amounts of the two hexoses glucose and fructose, wine producers worldwide often {{have to contend with}} high residual fructose levels (> 2 gl- 1) that may account for undesirable sweetness in finished dry wine. Here, we investigate the fermentation kinetics of glucose and fructose and the influence of certain environmental parameters on hexose utilisation by wine yeast. Seventeen Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, including commercial wine yeast strains, were evaluated in laboratory-scale wine fermentations using natural Colombard grape must that contained similar amounts of glucose and fructose (approximately 110 gl- 1 each). All strains showed preference for glucose, but to varying degrees. The discrepancy between glucose and fructose utilisation increased during the course of fermentation in a strain-dependent manner. We ranked the S. cerevisiae strains according to their rate of increase in GF discrepancy and we showed that this rate of increase is not correlated with the fermentation capacity of the strains. We also investigated the effect of ethanol and nitrogen addition on hexose utilisation during wine fermentation in both natural and synthetic grape must. Addition of ethanol had a stronger inhibitory effect on fructose than on glucose utilisation. Supplementation of must with assimilable nitrogen stimulated fructose utilisation more than glucose utilisation. These results show that the discrepancy between glucose and fructose utilisation during fermentation is not a fixed parameter but is dependent on the inherent properties of the yeast strain and on the external conditions. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.

50|$|By 1876 Assmanshausen was the {{principal}} vineyard and winery in the Warwick district, with 10 acres under vines. Older plantings included both white (verdelho, muscadine and salvina) and red (black Spanish and Mataro) grapes, but more recent plantings were reds only: Mataro and Hermitage. Most of the vines were trellised, the newer ones planted about 6' x 6' apart, and Kircher had invented a horse-drawn cultivator which could weed and turn the soil close to the vines while the horse walked at a sufficient distance to prevent vine damage from the traces. Kircher was producing unfortified wines wines made without the addition of cane sugar or spirits, and had already won prizes at the Warwick and Brisbane exhibitions. At this period the Assmanshausen winery comprised a dressed stone building of 3 flats: an underground cellar; a ground-level workroom; and a steeply-pitched shingled roof containing an attic space. The attic was ventilated by 12 air shafts fitted with shutters on the inside, ensuring that {{the temperature in the}} attic was cooler than that of the ground floor. There were also 6 air shafts in the cellar. These shafts sloped through the stone walls {{to the surface of the}} ground. Kircher had devised his own system of wine production: the press was located in the ground floor workroom; from here the <b>must</b> (<b>unfermented</b> grape juice) was suction-pumped through pipes up to the attic, where it was fermented in 500 and 300 gallon vats before being fed through more pipes to the underground cellar, where it matured in wooden butts.|$|R
