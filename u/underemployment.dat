5|$|Newark {{is one of}} nine {{cities in}} New Jersey {{designated}} as eligible for Urban Transit Hub Tax Credits by the state's Economic Development Authority. Developers who invest a minimum of $50 million within 0.5 miles of a train station are eligible for pro-rated tax credit. After the election of Cory Booker, {{millions of dollars of}} public-private partnership investment were made in Downtown development but persistent <b>underemployment</b> continue to characterize many of the city's neighborhoods. Poverty remains a consistent problem in Newark. As of 2010, roughly one-third of the city's population was impoverished.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and <b>underemployment,</b> as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E
5|$|Booker's mayoralty and {{personal}} celebrity drew much media attention to Newark. While he enjoyed high ratings from city residents, his legacy has received mixed reviews. During his tenure, {{millions of dollars}} were invested in downtown development, but <b>underemployment</b> and high murder rates continue to characterize many of the city's neighborhoods. Despite legal challenges initiated during his term, Newark Public Schools has remained under {{control of the state}} for nearly twenty years. Newark received $32 million in emergency state aid in 2011 and 2012, requiring a memorandum of understanding between Newark and the state that obligates the city to request and the state to approve appointments to city hall administrative positions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{months of the}} Chamorro administration, social {{programs}} including free bus tokens for the education sector, pensions {{for the elderly and}} disabled, child care and child development services, and health care initiatives were cut. By 1991 the austerity measures adopted by Chamorro's administration were leading to massive strikes. Chamorro chose to recognize the workers' right to 25% of the shares of privatized state enterprises despite of the disapproval that generated both at home and abroad. The Sandinistas, who had removed some of the businesses from the private sector during their administration were not in favor of privatization, but they were in favor of workers sharing in the revenues. The far-right of her own coalition was against making labor compromises of any kind. The US embassy and United States Agency for International Development both voiced displeasure at the concessions and speed with which the economic plan was being implemented. In spite of the other programs implemented, inflation was reduced by the renegotiation of the country's debt (called for by the Lacayo Plan). Through negotiations, Nicaragua was able to obtain a writedown of 75% of their international debt on the condition that they had no arrears. As noted previously, the US assisted Nicaragua in paying off the past-due debt to the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank through bridge loans and negotiating a 95% writedown of debts owed to Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. These measures provided the means to end hyperinflation and reopen monetary markets, but they were overshadowed by high unemployment, <b>underemployment</b> and an overall recession. The trade deficit rose and GNP declined, and overall, low wages, reductions of education and health services caused poverty to escalate, and social tensions to rise.|$|E
25|$|<b>Underemployment</b> among {{fresh and}} senior {{graduates}} has increased {{since the early}} 1990s. Among the degree owners with {{the highest rates of}} <b>underemployment</b> are those who earned degrees in teaching, psychology, philosophy, economics, business administration, management, technical accounting, sociology, short-cycle engineering (technical engineering), some non-traditional engineerings, law, journalism, languages, history, and related fields of study. Several thousand people in this situation, have part-time or full-time occupations in a range of unspecialized jobs for unskilled or marginally skilled workers.|$|E
25|$|John Maynard Keynes {{explained}} that situation as an <b>underemployment</b> equilibrium where skeptic business prospects prevent companies from hiring new employees. It {{was seen as}} a form of cyclical unemployment.|$|E
25|$|Under the JG, {{people of}} working age {{who are not}} in {{full-time}} education and have less than 35 hours per week of paid employment would be entitled to the balance of 35 hours paid employment, undertaking work of public benefit at the minimum wage. The aim is to replace unemployment and <b>underemployment</b> with paid employment (up to the hours desired by workers), so that those who are at any point in time surplus to the requirements of the private sector (and mainstream public sector) can earn a reasonable living rather than suffer the indignity and insecurity of <b>underemployment,</b> poverty, and social exclusion.|$|E
25|$|Minimum wages will {{be raised}} to high levels, and <b>underemployment</b> {{compensation}} limited {{only to those}} who are incapable of working or can prove that they {{have not been able to}} find work. Jewish labor will be advocated.|$|E
25|$|Redevelopment efforts {{such as the}} Cultural Arts Center and {{downtown}} revitalization earned Gadsden {{first place in the}} 2000 City Livability Awards Program. <b>Underemployment</b> continues to be a severe problem, as indicated by the economic data presented below.|$|E
25|$|For many decades, {{there has}} been a growing public {{perception}} that a humanities education inadequately prepares graduates for employment. The common belief is that graduates from such programs face <b>underemployment</b> and incomes too low for a humanities education to be worth the investment.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{admission}} of so many students of only average ability to higher education inevitably requires a decline in academic standards, facilitated by grade inflation. Also, the supply of graduates in many fields of study is exceeding the demand for their skills, which aggravates graduate unemployment, <b>underemployment,</b> credentialism and educational inflation.|$|E
25|$|Under the Rural Renewal Program of 1962, the USDA {{provided}} {{technical and}} financial assistance for locally initiated and sponsored {{programs aimed at}} ending chronic <b>underemployment</b> and fostering a sound rural economy. Loans were made to local groups to establish small manufacturing plants, to build hospitals, to establish recreation areas, and to carry out similar developmental activities.|$|E
25|$|Unemployment {{rates are}} {{the lowest of}} all OECD member {{countries}} at 3.2 percent. However, <b>underemployment</b> is estimated at 25 percent. Mexico's Human development index was reported at 0.829, (comprising a life expectancy index of 0.84, an education index of 0.86 and a GDP index of 0.77), ranking 52 in the world within the group of high-development.|$|E
25|$|According to the Integrated Household Survey by DANE, in Barranquilla, {{during the}} quarter February to April 2010, the overall {{participation}} rate (TGP) was 58.5% occupancy rate (TO) of 53 5%, the <b>underemployment</b> rate subjective (TS Sub), 8.4%, the <b>underemployment</b> rate target (TS Obj) of 6.5% and {{the unemployment rate}} (TD) of 5.5%. Also, for the period May 2009 – April 2010, the TGP was 58%, 52.4% OT, ST (U) of 10.6%, CS (Obj) 5.6% and TD of 4.7%. According to the 2005 census, 12.0% of establishments engaged in industry, 65.2% in trade, services 51.3% and 1.4% to another activity. 24.8% of rural homes were occupied in farming. 43.5% of the establishments served between 1 and 10 jobs the month before the census. Most households simultaneously have 2 or 3 types of activities to make a living. The Gran Central de Abastos del Caribe market hall {{is very important for}} the collection and distribution of food to the city.|$|E
25|$|The Keynesian {{revolution}} is typically {{viewed as a}} major shift in macroeconomics. According to John Kenneth Galbraith, Say's Law dominated economic thought prior to Keynes for over a century, and the shift to Keynesianism was difficult. Economists who contradicted the law, which implied that <b>underemployment</b> and underinvestment (coupled with oversaving) were virtually impossible, risked losing their careers. In his magnum opus, Keynes cited one of his predecessors, John A. Hobson, who was repeatedly denied positions at universities for his heretical theory.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues of the 2006 elections is the economy. The high external debt and internal debt have inhibited growth. Around 75% of the population lives on less than US$2 a day, unemployment and <b>underemployment</b> are close to 50%, and income inequality is very pronounced. However, there have been some recent improvements. Real economic growth declined from 7.4% in 1999 to 1% in 2002, then turned around to grow back to 2.3% in 2003, and about 4% in 2004.|$|E
25|$|In most {{countries}} of the world, recovery from the Great Depression began in 1933. In the U.S., recovery began in early 1933, but the U.S. {{did not return to}} 1929 GNP for over a decade and still had an unemployment rate of about 15% in 1940, albeit down from the high of 25% in 1933. The measurement of the unemployment rate in this time period was unsophisticated and complicated by the presence of massive <b>underemployment,</b> in which employers and workers engaged in rationing of jobs.|$|E
25|$|The rate of {{unemployment}} and <b>underemployment</b> approaches {{half of the}} working-age population. Thus many Nepali citizens move to other countries in search of work. Destinations include India, Qatar, the United States, Thailand, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Brunei Darussalam, Australia, and Canada. Nepal receives $50 million a year through the Gurkha soldiers who serve in the Indian and British armies and are highly esteemed for their skill and bravery. , the total remittance value is around $3.5 billion. In 2009 alone, the remittance contributed to 22.9% of the nation's GDP.|$|E
25|$|According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) {{seasonally}} adjusted estimates, {{the unemployment rate}} decreased 0.1% to 5.5% in September 2017 while the labor force participation rate remained steady at 65.2%. The trend participation rate for 15-24 year olds increased by 0.3 percentage points to 67.7 per cent while unemployment rate for this group declined by less than 0.1% to 12.7%, decreasing by 0.3% over the year. According to the Australian Bureau of statistics, in August 2017, the quarterly <b>underemployment</b> rate decreased by 0.2% to 8.6% while the quarterly underutilisation rate (the unemployed plus the under-employed) decreased by 0.2% to 14.1 per cent.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} little ethnic strife in Paraguay to impede social and {{economic}} progress, there is social conflict caused by <b>underemployment</b> and the enormous economic inequality {{between the rich and}} the poor, who are mostly rural inhabitants. Positive steps to correct these inequities have occurred since the 1989 ousting of Stroessner, and the occupation by the poor {{of hundreds of thousands of}} acres of land, which they claimed for subsistence farming. The country's political system is moving toward a fully functioning democracy. However, the tradition of political hierarchical organizational structures and generous rewarding of political favors prevails.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, {{the pace}} of {{structural}} reforms, including fiscal, monetary policies, taxation, privatization and new business legislations, helped Egypt move towards a more market-oriented economy and prompted increased foreign investment. The reforms and policies have strengthened macroeconomic annual growth results which averaged 8% annually between 2004 and 2009 but the government largely failed to equitably share the wealth {{and the benefits of}} growth have failed to trickle down to improve economic conditions for the broader population, especially with the growing problem of unemployment and <b>underemployment.</b> After the 2011 revolution Egypt's foreign exchange reserves fell from $36 billion in December 2010 to only $16.3 billion in January 2012, also in February 2012 Standard & Poor's rating agency lowered the Egypt's credit rating from B+ to B in the long term.|$|E
25|$|Other major {{problems}} concern {{the labor force}} and the pricing system. There is large-scale <b>underemployment</b> in both urban and rural areas, {{and the fear of}} the disruptive effects of major, explicit unemployment is strong. The prices of certain key commodities, especially of industrial raw materials and major industrial products, are determined by the state. In most cases, basic price ratios were set in the 1950s and are often irrational in terms of current production capabilities and demands. Over the years, large subsidies were built into the price structure and these subsidies grew substantially in the late 1970s and 1980s. By the early 1990s, these subsidies began to be eliminated, in large part due to China's admission into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, which carried with it requirements for further economic liberalization and deregulation.|$|E
25|$|Forecasts for the medium- and {{long-term}} remain highly positive. Peru's real GDP growth in 2007 was (8.3%) and largest in Latin America in 2008 was an outstanding 9.8%, {{the highest in}} the world. Inflation remained low, at about 3%, while the budget surplus is expected to remain at about 1% of GDP. Private investment should keep growing at a rate of 15% a year. Exports and imports are expected to keep rising. The unemployment and <b>underemployment</b> indexes (5.2% and 34%, respectively, in Lima) should keep coming down as the economy grows, other cities in Peru like Cajamarca, Ica, Cuzco and Trujillo are starting to show less unemployment nowadays. The country is likely to attract future domestic and foreign investment in tourism, agriculture, mining, petroleum and natural gas, power industries and financial institutions.|$|E
25|$|Problems in {{communities}} or cultures, including poverty, unemployment or <b>underemployment,</b> {{lack of social}} cohesion, and migration, {{have been associated with}} the development of mental disorders. Stresses and strains related to socioeconomic position (socioeconomic status (SES) or social class) have been linked to the occurrence of major mental disorders, with a lower or more insecure educational, occupational, economic or social position generally linked to more mental disorders. There have been mixed findings {{on the nature of the}} links and on the extent to which pre-existing personal characteristics influence the links. Both personal resources and community factors have been implicated, as well as interactions between individual-level and regional-level income levels. The causal role of different socioeconomic factors may vary by country. Socioeconomic deprivation in neighborhoods can cause worse mental health, even after accounting for genetic factors. In addition, minority ethnic groups, including first or second-generation immigrants, have been found to be at greater risk for developing mental disorders, which has been attributed to various kinds of life insecurities and disadvantages, including racism. The direction of causality is sometimes unclear, and alternative hypotheses such as the Drift Hypothesis sometimes need to be discounted.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{globalization}} in {{the past}} thirty years, {{the power of the}} unskilled worker has diminished, and thus, the informal economy has flourished. In Latin America, there is an abundant number of workers to help out with domestic work, and consequently, domestic service is cheap, diminishing the family tensions surrounding the issue of domestic work. Currently, about half of the working population is employed in the informal sector, leading to [...] "unemployment, <b>underemployment,</b> and social exclusion". Because of this, there has been a serious delay in providing welfare for the care of children and the elderly, because the pressure to provide aid for working families is minimal. In addition, domestic workers, many of them women, often leave their countries to work in the informal sector in northern countries in order to increase income for their families, also delaying the pressure for governments to provide aid to these families. However, there has been a change since the 2000s in thinking about unpaid work due to the influx of paid jobs for women and the shortage of people available to do domestic work.|$|E
