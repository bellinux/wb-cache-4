50|$|<b>Unified</b> <b>Lumumbist</b> <b>Party</b> (Parti Lumumbiste Unifié or PALU) is a {{political}} party in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The party's name comes from Patrice Lumumba, the first prime minister of Congo after its independence in 1960 from the Belgian colonial empire.|$|E
50|$|Gizenga {{turned down}} an offer of UN {{protection}} and was eventually imprisoned on the island Bula Mbemba {{in the mouth of}} the Congo River. In July 1964 Tshombe became prime minister and, as part of an attempted political reconciliation, ordered Gizenga's release. In spite of this, Gizenga quickly organised a <b>Lumumbist</b> <b>party</b> and denounced Tshombe's handling of the Simba rebellion. As a result, Gizenga was placed under house arrest in September. Mobutu seized power in a coup in November 1965, thereby freeing Gizenga. He fled to Congo-Brazzaville, though he soon settled in Moscow to pursue a doctorate in political science.|$|R

50|$|Following {{the fall}} of Mobutu's one-man rule in Zaire, MNC-Lumumba was refounded. In 1992, it elected Patrice Lumumba's eldest son, François Lumumba, as their leader. Lumumba's {{heritage}} is also claimed by the <b>Unified</b> <b>Lumumbist</b> <b>Party</b> (PALU) led by Lumumba's former deputy, Antoine Gizenga, the former Prime Minister. Another of Lumumba's sons, Guy-Patrice Lumumba is also active in Congolese politics.|$|E
50|$|The {{image of}} Patrice Lumumba {{continues}} {{to serve as}} an inspiration in contemporary Congolese politics. In the 2006 elections, several parties claimed to be motivated by his ideas, including the People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD), the political party initiated by the incumbent President Joseph Kabila. Antoine Gizenga, who served as Lumumba's Deputy Prime Minister in the post-independence period, was a 2006 Presidential candidate under the <b>Unified</b> <b>Lumumbist</b> <b>Party</b> (Parti Lumumbiste Unifié (PALU)) and was named prime minister {{at the end of the}} year. His campaign platform was based on Lumumba's ideas. Other political parties that directly utilise his name include the Mouvement National Congolais-Lumumba (MNC-L) and the Mouvement Lumumbiste (MLP).|$|E
