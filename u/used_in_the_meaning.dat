2500|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, {{historian}} Ericus Olai claimed that Bishop Kol of Linköping (died about 1196) {{had been the}} Duke of Finland (Dux Finlandiae). In the late 12th century in Sweden, the Latin title [...] "dux" [...] was still <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of jarl and came to mean duke only a hundred years later (see Swedish duchies). Ericus Olai's claim is not supported by other sources. However, some historians date the small Stenberga Castle in Masku to the late 12th century, when the Novgorodian wars reached Finland and may {{have resulted in a}} temporary Swedish military presence in the area.|$|E
2500|$|According to some scholars, {{these words}} {{mean that the}} whisperer whispers evil into the hearts of two kinds of people: the jinn and the men. If this meaning is admitted, the word nās would apply to both jinn and men. They say {{that this can be}} so, for when the word rijāl (men) in the Quran has been used for the jinn, as in Al-Jinn: 6, and when nafar can be used for the single of jinn, or human as in Al-Ahqaf: 29, men and jinn both can be {{included}} metaphorically in the word nās also. But this view is wrong, [...] because the words nās, ʾins and ʾinsān are even lexically contrary in meaning to the word jinn. The actual meaning of jinn is hidden creation and jinn is called jinn because he is hidden from man's eye. On the contrary, the words nās and ʾins are spoken for ʾinsān (man) only on the basis that he is manifest and visible and perceptible. In Surah Al-Qasas: 29, the word anasa has been <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of ra'a, i.e. [...] "the Prophet Moses saw a fire in the direction of Tur. [...] " [...] In Surah An-Nisa': 6, the word anastum has been <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of ahsastum or ra'aytum (i.e. if one perceives or sees that the orphans have become capable). Therefore, nās cannot apply to jinn lexically, and the correct meaning of the verse is: [...] "from the evil of the whisperer who whispers evil into the hearts of men, whether he be from among the jinn or from the men themselves." [...] In other words, whispering of evil is done by devils from among jinn as well as by devils from among men and the prayer in this surah has been taught to seek refuge from the evil of both. This meaning is supported by the Qur'an {{as well as by the}} Hadith. The Qur'an says: [...] "And so it has always been that We set against every Prophet enemies from among devils of men and devils of jinn, who have been inspiring one another with charming things to delude the minds." [...] (Al-An'am :112) ...|$|E
2500|$|The third theory {{links the}} name of Mieszko with his other name, Dagome, as it {{appeared}} in the document called Dagome iudex. We know this document only from a copy prepared by an anonymous monk who was not familiar with Polish language or Polish names. It is possible that while copying the document {{he made a mistake}} and wrote down Dagome instead of Dagomer or even Dagomir. The name Dagomir is used to this day and its construction is similar to other Polish names like for example: Władimir/Włodzimierz or Casimir/Kazimierz. The evolution of the [...] "-mir" [...] element to [...] "-mierz" [...] is due to two separate developments: first, the regular change of the vowel [...] "i" [...] to [...] "(i)e" [...] before [...] "r", and second, the modification of the nominative case by the vocative for certain names (hence, Kazimierz replaced Kazimier based on the vocative Kazimierze). It is debatable whether the name Mieszko is a nickname formed from {{the second part of the}} name *Dago-mierz, since the merger in pronunciation of [...] "sz" [...] with the devoiced [...] "rz" [...] which would appear in this position is quite recent. However, some historians believe that the word [...] "Dagome" [...] is a melding of two names: the Roman Catholic [...] "Dago," [...] for [...] "Dagobert" [...] (Mieszko's hypothetical baptismal name), and the Slavic [...] "Me," [...] for [...] "Mieszko." [...] The Latin word [...] "iudex" [...] ("judge") would be <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "prince." [...] Another interpretation is that [...] "Dagome iudex" [...] is a corruption of [...] "Ego Mesco dux" [...] ("I, Prince Mieszko").|$|E
