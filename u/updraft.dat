5|$|The Solar <b>updraft</b> tower (SUT) is a renewable-energy {{power plant}} for {{generating}} electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath {{a very wide}} greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall chimney tower. The resulting convection causes a hot air <b>updraft</b> in the tower by the chimney effect. This airflow drives wind turbines placed in the chimney <b>updraft</b> or around the chimney base to produce electricity. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Finn has enough, {{and knocks}} the king's clock from the wall. It crashes into the kingdom's huge stove, {{knocking}} over {{a pot of}} water. The water puts out the fire, which causes the warm <b>updraft</b> going into the chimney to cease; this <b>updraft</b> was actually holding Seven's barge in stasis all of this time. The barge comes crashing down into the kingdom, and Jake uses his stretching powers to save Finn. Thence, Finn, Jake, and Seven escape.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are trained}} to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a supercell. They typically look to its rear, the main region of <b>updraft</b> and inflow. Under the <b>updraft</b> is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is {{the formation of a}} rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.|$|E
25|$|If the {{environmental}} air is near saturation, condensation may occur in <b>updrafts</b> produced from the vortex rotation. The sinking motion produced between alternating pairs of rolls will evaporate clouds. This, {{combined with the}} <b>updrafts,</b> will produce rows of clouds. Glider pilots often use the <b>updrafts</b> produced by cloud streets enabling them to fly straight for long distances, hence the name “cloud streets”.|$|R
50|$|The winds in a {{tropical}} cyclone {{are the result}} of evaporation and condensation of moisture which results in <b>updrafts.</b> The <b>updrafts</b> in turn increase the height of the storm which causes more condensation.|$|R
50|$|A {{widespread}} misconception in {{the world}} of soaring is that the <b>updrafts</b> associated with an incoming thunderstorm are almost always very strong and turbulent,which is most of the time incorrect. If one believes this myth, then he would consider it safe (from thunderstorms, at least) to fly in an area with plentiful weak to moderate <b>updrafts,</b> since the <b>updrafts</b> associated with thunderstorms are always supposed to be strong and turbulent.|$|R
5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an <b>updraft</b> that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials {{in a way that}} mimics greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the <b>updraft</b> and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the <b>updraft</b> intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mature}} {{stage of a}} thunderstorm, the warmed air {{continues}} to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this 'cap' is the tropopause. The air is instead forced to spread out, giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape. The resulting cloud is called cumulonimbus incus. The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become rain. If the <b>updraft</b> is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large {{that they do not}} melt completely but fall as hail. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating downdrafts as well. The simultaneous presence of both an <b>updraft</b> and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds. During this stage, considerable internal turbulence can occur within, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even tornadoes.|$|E
50|$|However, {{if the air}} at {{the surface}} is {{unstable}} enough, strong <b>updrafts</b> can be forced through the capping inversion. This selective process of only allowing the strongest <b>updrafts</b> to form thunderstorms often results in outbreaks of severe weather.|$|R

5|$|The engine used {{a single}} <b>updraft</b> carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The carburetor was {{on the right side of}} the engine, the mixture went into a passage through the engine block to the intake manifold on the left side of the engine. Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{area of a}} {{squall line}} is {{composed}} primarily of multiple updrafts, or singular regions of an <b>updraft,</b> rising from ground level to the highest extensions of the troposphere, condensing water and building a dark, ominous cloud to one with a noticeable overshooting top and anvil (thanks to synoptic scale winds). Because of the chaotic nature of updrafts and downdrafts, pressure perturbations are important.|$|E
5|$|Typically, {{if there}} is little wind shear, the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and 'rain itself out', but, {{if there is}} {{sufficient}} change in wind speed and/or direction, the downdraft will {{be separated from the}} <b>updraft,</b> and the storm may become a supercell, where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours.|$|E
5000|$|The author {{means that}} when flying under a {{flanking}} line, the <b>updrafts</b> will be widespread and smooth. Since the cells making the flanking line will fuse with the main cell, the soaring conditions will [...] "improve", the <b>updrafts</b> will become stronger and stronger and the cloud base will become darker and darker.|$|R
50|$|In this {{idealized}} environment, as new <b>updrafts</b> are initiated due to {{the pressure}} perturbations from the original split, additional crosswise vorticity will be tilted into the vertical on the flanks of the new <b>updrafts.</b> This {{will result in the}} continuation of the process that results in splitting, with a continuous propagation of new <b>updrafts</b> to the right and left of the hodograph. This allows each split to start the process over, splitting again and again until the environmental vertical wind shear no longer favors splitting supercells, or the storms have moved into an unfavorable thermodynamic environment.|$|R

5|$|A steam {{devil is}} a {{rotating}} <b>updraft</b> between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations {{do not involve}} high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.|$|E
5|$|Dust {{kicked up}} by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the {{darkness}} of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly {{the sound of an}} approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's <b>updraft</b> base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E
5|$|The bounded weak echo region, {{also known}} as a BWER or a vault, is a radar {{signature}} within a thunderstorm characterized by a local minimum in radar reflectivity at low levels which extends upward into, and is surrounded by, higher reflectivities aloft. This feature is associated with a strong <b>updraft</b> and is almost always found in the inflow region of a thunderstorm. It cannot be seen visually. The BWER has been noted on radar imagery of severe thunderstorms since 1973 and has a lightning detection system equivalent known as a lightning hole.|$|E

One {{of the goals}} was to improve the understanding of cirrus generation by convective <b>updrafts.</b> The reasons why some convective storms produce extensive cirrus anvils is only partially related to convective instability and the vertical transport ice mass by <b>updrafts.</b> Convective microphysics must also {{have an important role}} on cirrus generation, for example, there are hypotheses that homogeneous nucleation in convective <b>updrafts</b> is a major source of anvil ice particles.

5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective <b>updraft</b> is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E
5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} the ground by {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its <b>updraft</b> and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E
5|$|Film badges used {{to measure}} {{exposure}} to radioactivity indicated that no observers at N-10,000 {{had been exposed to}} more than 0.1 roentgens, but the shelter was evacuated before the radioactive cloud could reach it. The explosion was more efficient than expected and the thermal <b>updraft</b> drew most of the cloud high enough that little fallout fell on the test site. The crater was far more radioactive than expected due to the formation of trinitite, and the crews of the two lead-lined Sherman tanks were subjected to considerable exposure. Anderson's dosimeter and film badge recorded 7 to 10 roentgens, and one of the tank drivers, who made three trips, recorded 13 to 15 roentgens.|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{vertical}} velocity measurements using a 50 -MHz wind profiler {{located at}} Darwin in northern Australia {{during periods of}} active convection have been analyzed. This dataset is dominated by continental-type convection. Numerous examples of shallow, deep, and decaying convection were seen and it is shown that only the deep systems have substantial tilts to the draft structure. The most intense <b>updrafts</b> occur above the freezing level, but shallow convection also produces large-amplitude vertical motions. The strength of these <b>updrafts</b> in this dataset {{is very similar to}} other tropical, oceanic data. That observation is consistent with the idea that the magnitude of the <b>updrafts</b> is much less in the Tropics than for intense midlatitude convection because the convective available potential energy is distributed over a much deeper layer in the Tropics, although more intense <b>updrafts</b> may be present at other tropical locations, such as the Tiwi Islands north of Darwin. The size of the cores, however, is significantly greater here than with oceanic data and is similar to midlatitude results, thus supporting the suggestion that boundary layer depth is important in determining the horizontal scale. There is a net detrainment in the upward cores above the freezing level occurring at all space scales. The mass flux in intense <b>updrafts</b> is almost constant with height below the freezing level but is almost cancelled by downdrafts and the immediate surrounding environment. Two populations of downdrafts are seen, one a dynamical respons...|$|R
5|$|On April 25, 1935 at 6:43pm, a {{custodial}} engineer {{called the}} Salem Fire Department to report smoke. Citizens helped to remove {{items from the}} smoky building, but when firefighters arrived, they ordered everyone to leave the structure, which was soon engulfed in flame. Among the helping citizens was twelve-year-old Mark Hatfield, who later became governor. It was determined the fire started {{in the basement of}} the east wing and quickly spread to piles of old records. A strong <b>updraft</b> in the hollow columns enclosing the dome's eight supporting steel lattice girders pulled the flames through the rotunda to upper stories. The intense heat burned even the copper dome and lit the night sky.|$|E
5|$|In the {{dissipation}} stage, the thunderstorm {{is dominated}} by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the <b>updraft</b> disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.|$|E
5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various {{sections of the}} hill is used to generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. A reasonable amount of headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards the hill too early. In particular, the presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an <b>updraft</b> along various points of the hill – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive visual effect for audiences.|$|E
