500|$|Coolbrith {{continued}} {{to write and}} work to support herself. From 1909 to final publication in 1917, she painstakingly collected and edited a book of Stoddard's poetry, writing a foreword and joining her short memorial poem [...] "At Anchor" [...] to verse submitted by Stoddard's friends Joaquin Miller, George Sterling and Thomas Walsh. At the age of 80, McCracken wrote to Coolbrith to complain to her dear friend of still having {{to work for a}} living: [...] "The world has not used <b>us</b> <b>well,</b> Ina; California has been ungrateful to us. Of all the hundred thousands the state pays out in pensions of one kind and another, don't you think you should be {{at the head of the}} pensioners, and I somewhere down below?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the players}} {{who went to the}} West Indies, the only ones who had played against South Africa in the summer were Hutton, Evans, Cranston, Robertson, Howorth and Butler. Hardstaff and Ikin had been to Australia and New Zealand the {{previous}} winter. The other eight were Allen and seven newcomers: Dennis Brookes, Billy Griffith, Jim Laker, Winston Place, Gerald Smithson, Maurice Tremlett and Johnny Wardle. Playfair was disappointed with the situation in the West Indies, especially as England were well beaten in the Test series. The team, it said, [...] "could not be called great by any standards" [...] as it was too [...] "experimental" [...] but it at least seemed [...] "workmanlike" [...] and in Laker a new star had been discovered. Playfair ominously concluded its review by reference to the 1948 Australian team being [...] "about to descend upon <b>us</b> <b>well</b> armed in all key departments (and) we shall have to do better than this".|$|E
2500|$|Gingrich {{has been}} very {{critical}} of Obama's handling {{of the crisis in}} Egypt, and has warned of the possibility that Egypt might [...] "go the way of Iran". Gingrich said, [...] "I think this is a period of tremendous challenge and is a sign of the general failure of our strategy of not dealing with radical Islamists and not being honest and aggressive of what's going on around the world." [...] Gingrich also said that the Obama administration had failed to take the Middle East seriously and that Obama's 2009 speech in Cairo designed to improve relations with the Muslim world was a mistake. Gingrich said, [...] "The president went to Cairo and gave his famous speech in which he explained that we should all be friends together because we're all the same people doing the same things and there are no differences between <b>us.</b> <b>Well,</b> I {{think there are a lot}} of differences between the Muslim Brotherhood and the rest of us." ...|$|E

2500|$|The API Subcommittee on Well Data Retrieval Systems {{was formed}} in 1962 to {{standardize}} well identification numbers. [...] The first recommendations of the subcommittee were published in 1966 as Appendix A of API Bulletin D12 (Well Data Glossary). [...] In April 1968, API published Bulletin D12A, which dealt solely with well numbering systems. [...] This publication was modified slightly in December 1970 and January 1979, and the 1979 edition (reissued in 1982 and 1985) is the most current version. In 1995, the Subcommittee drafted some modifications to the API numbering scheme, but the group was disbanded before the recommendations were published. [...] The 1979 standards are still in effect, but the publication is no longer available from API [...] In 2013, the PPDM Association issued an updated standard for the API Number (now called the <b>US</b> <b>Well</b> Number) which includes a requirement to identify all wellbores within each well. The 1979 standard and the 2013 standard, along with supporting materials, are available at PPDM Association's website for well identification.|$|E
2500|$|On June 8, 2014, Jerad and Amanda Miller {{killed two}} Las Vegas police {{officers}} and a civilian before Amanda Miller took her life. Jerad Miller was fatally wounded and died during a shootout with police. During the attacks, they shouted [...] "this is a revolution", and they covered {{the bodies of the}} officers in a Gadsden flag and left a copy of a manifesto bearing a swastika. Their original plan may have been to take over a courthouse and execute public officials. The Millers had moved from Indiana to the Las Vegas area in January. They were quoted on Reno television KRNV: [...] "I feel sorry for any federal agents that want to come here and try to push around or anything like that. I really don't want violence toward them but if they're gonna come and bring violence to <b>us,</b> <b>well,</b> if that's the language they want to speak, we'll learn it." [...] Miller commented on the issues involved in greater length in social media, and interviewed other protesters at the Bundy ranch.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2001 Lindner {{was outraged}} by the news that Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama was going to address the Minnesota Legislature. [...] In an e-mail to House members he stated “As a Christian, I am {{offended}} {{that we would have}} the Dalai Lama come and speak to a joint meeting of our Minnesota Legislature. [...] He claims to be a god-king, a leader of the Buddha religion, which historically has been considered a cult because of its anti-Biblical teachings concerning the one true Holy God, Creator of Heaven and earth and His Son, Jesus Christ. [...] A Buddhist would say, ‘Why the big fuss about abortion and euthanasia? After all, we are all reincarnated {{over and over again in}} many lives, so why the big deal about ending one?’ These beliefs are incompatible with Christian principles, and those Christian principles are or have been the governing principles of American society. There is a public religious ethic that prevails in this country, Judeo-Christian, demanding a public adherence to that standard in terms of behavior rather than belief. [...] The Judeo-Christian ethic is the moral and spiritual foundation of our Constitution, Bill of Rights and most of our laws and it has served <b>us</b> <b>well.</b> ...I for one will not be present on the morning of May 9.” ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{announcement}} of the storyline, Soaplife said it [...] "could be fun but could be the ruin of Kat if they get it wrong", and wondered if it would put EastEnders [...] "back on top of its game", saying, [...] "That depends on Kat. If we're made to love and care about her, yes. If she comes over as a conniving, sneaky cheat only interested in her own wants and desires, no." [...] They opined that Alfie {{should be the one}} having the affair, as he cannot do anything right in Kat's eyes. They also said they [...] "wondered which Kat we'd be getting back after Jessie Wallace's break. Would it be the tart with a heart that made Kat a soap icon? Or the alley Kat that we got last year (Kat down the alley with delivery man Mark was not her finest moment). Now with the reveal that she'll have a mystery that we can all spend weeks or months trying to guess , we fear it will be more alley Kat." [...] All About Soap thought that because of the way Kat got rid of Roxy after she moved in with Alfie while Kat was away, [...] "you'd think that [...] Kat was really committed to her husband [...] and determined to make her marriage work" [...] but called the affair [...] "sizzling", saying it would [...] "send shockwaves all round Albert Square!" [...] Soaplife said that the storyline {{may turn out to be}} a good mystery, but [...] "when it comes to affairs, we prefer ours with a heap-big dose of love". However, they later said the storyline was [...] "getting boring". In All About Soap, letters page editor Laura thought the affair would be [...] "the hottest thing in the Square this summer!" [...] Soaplife awarded the storyline a bronze medal in their [...] "2012 Soap Olympics" [...] for [...] "best storyline cycling", as Kat is [...] "cheating again. Round and round she goes." [...] Kate White from Inside Soap said: [...] "Well, Kathleen Slater Moon, if you were hoping to win our sympathy by suggesting that this secret fling business is all Alfie's fault, think again! Yes, it's a bit annoying when your other half is too busy to pay you much attention—but there should at least be an effort to sort out your issues before you decide cheating is the answer! We're finding it hard to have sympathy". The magazine later called the storyline [...] "unusual" [...] but said that [...] "Kat has been busy showing us how infidelity should be done". When the affair turned from lust to love, Soaplife said that it was [...] "what the affair needed right from the start in order to save Kat's reputation." [...] Steven Murphy, editor of Inside Soap said that when the storyline started, he and his colleagues were [...] "a little intrigued" [...] but after Michael was eliminated, they were [...] "totally obsessed!" [...] An Inside Soap reporter said that [...] " [...] decision to keep the man's identity a secret—and to have several characters reacting as if it could be them—means that this is soap like we've never seen it before", and added that [...] "it makes for frustrating viewing at times, but there's no denying that this plot has <b>us</b> <b>well</b> and truly hooked. It's not so much a 'whodunnit?' as a 'who-done-her?'" ...|$|E
