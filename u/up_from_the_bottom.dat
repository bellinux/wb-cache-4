5|$|The {{majority}} {{of the population of the}} Pacific walrus spends its summers north of the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea of the Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of eastern Siberia, around Wrangel Island, in the Beaufort Sea along the north shore of Alaska south to Unimak Island, and in the waters between those locations. Smaller numbers of males summer in the Gulf of Anadyr on the southern coast of the Siberian Chukchi Peninsula, and in Bristol Bay off the southern coast of Alaska, west of the Alaska Peninsula. In the spring and fall, walruses congregate throughout the Bering Strait, reaching from the western coast of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr. They winter over in the Bering Sea along the eastern coast of Siberia south to the northern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and along the southern coast of Alaska. A 28,000-year-old fossil walrus was dredged <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of San Francisco Bay, indicating Pacific walruses ranged that far south during the last ice age. There were roughly 200,000 Pacific walruses according to the most recent (1990) census-based estimate.|$|E
25|$|This tournament {{was also}} notable {{for a major}} upset, with Italy coming <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the table, to beat then holders France. Despite this upset, Italy would still {{subsequently}} end up finishing last, and was awarded the wooden spoon as a result. The champions were England, who won their first four matches, but were denied the Grand Slam and the Triple Crown by a defeat to Ireland.|$|E
5000|$|The sediments {{that contain}} {{fragments}} of early cemented limestones of extra-basinal origin are called extraclasts. Examples of intraclasts include mudlumps that are torn <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of lagoons during storms, hardened desiccated mudflakes produced in intertidal and supratidal environments and fragments broken from cemented deepsea crusts.|$|R

25|$|The ident {{used with}} the look was a black white and grey affair. It was an {{animation}} that started with grey and black lines flying in from left and right before the white numeral '2' in a black box flies from the top with the BBC logo in the same shade as the bottom line, flies <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> This animation {{is accompanied by a}} trumpeted fanfare, composed by Freddie Phillips, and which was based on the morse code translation of 'BBC Two'.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} his amateur pedigree, Sakuraba was forced to work his way <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the UWFi's rung, as it is {{traditional}} in puroresu. Sakuraba lost his debut in 1993 to Steve Nelson and went winless through his rookie year with the league. It is also popularly alleged that under the eye of Kiyoshi Tamura, he was made to perfectly perform menial chores about the dojo. Still undeterred, Sakuraba steadily built a working knowledge of submission holds upon his freestyle wrestling base until his efforts were at last rewarded with a win over Mark Silver in October 1994.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was designed to}} a BEA requirement for a 100-seat aircraft to replace their Viscounts. The original Type 870 design was then modified when TCA expressed their interest in the design as well, and Vickers returned the updated Type 950 that filled both requirements. The main difference between the Viscount and Vanguard was {{the construction of the}} fuselage. The Vanguard started with the original Viscount fuselage, but cut it off about halfway <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> replacing the top section with a larger-diameter fuselage to give it a double bubble cross-section (similar to the Boeing Stratocruiser). The result of the larger upper portion was a roomier interior, with increased cargo capacity below the floor.|$|E

25|$|The {{image is}} of a funeral {{procession}} of beings, possibly celestial, {{led by an}} angel-figure floating above the ground. The profiles of the figures suggest pre-Columbian art, and possibly an ancient Egyptian influence, as well. The angel-figure {{as well as the}} mourners have luminous peaks above their heads, in a re-imagining of halos. The shapes of the peaks are repeated by tongues of fire that point <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> edge of the painting. The image strongly suggests an afterworld, {{but it is not clear}} from the image whether the environment correlates to tradition Christian understandings of heaven or hell. Xul Solar provides his viewer with a new image of an afterlife.|$|E
25|$|Android {{distributions}} {{by other}} manufacturers typically use different lock screen designs than what stock Android utilizes; newer versions of HTC's Sense used a metallic ring dragged {{from the bottom}} of the screen to unlock the phone, and also allows users to launch apps by dragging their respective shortcut icon into the ring instead. On recent Samsung devices, the lock screen involves dragging in any direction from any location on the screen (with TouchWiz Nature devices, such as the Galaxy S III and S4, it is also accompanied by a visual effect such as a pond ripple or lens flare); similarly to HTC's lock screen, app shortcuts can be dragged <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the screen to unlock directly into them.|$|E
25|$|Thirty-seven of {{the wells}} were built {{on or near}} {{existing}} Aboriginal waters and were constructed in the European tradition, which made many of them inaccessible to Aboriginal people. Pulling the heavy buckets <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the wells required the strength of three men or use of a camel. Consequentially, many Aboriginal people were injured or died while trying to access the water, either falling in and drowning or breaking bones on the windlass handle. In reprisal, buckets were cut off or timber set on fire, and by 1917 Aboriginal people had vandalised or dismantled {{approximately half of the}} wells in a bid to reclaim access to the water or to prevent drovers from using the wells. Canning's party had constructed the wells with the forced help of one of the Aboriginal peoples whose land the route traversed, the Martu.|$|E

60|$|Glancing {{down at his}} feet, Captain Delano saw the freed hand of {{the servant}} aiming with a second dagger--a small one, before {{concealed}} in his wool--with this he was snakishly writhing <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> boat's <b>bottom,</b> at <b>the</b> heart of his master, his countenance lividly vindictive, expressing the centred purpose of his soul; while the Spaniard, half-choked, was vainly shrinking away, with husky words, incoherent to all but the Portuguese.|$|R
25|$|Corsets {{are held}} {{together}} by lacing, usually (though not always) at the back. Tightening or loosening the lacing produces corresponding changes in the firmness of the corset. Depending on the desired effect and time period, corsets can be laced from the top down, from the bottom up, or both <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> and down from the top, using two laces that meet in the middle. In the Victorian heyday of corsets, a well-to-do woman's corset laces would be tightened by her maid, and a gentleman's by his valet. However, Victorian corsets also had a buttoned or hooked front opening called a busk. If the corset was worn loosely, {{it was possible to}} leave the lacing as adjusted and take the corset on and off using the front opening. (If the corset is worn snugly, this method will damage the busk if the lacing is not significantly loosened beforehand). Self-lacing is very difficult with tightlacing - also called waist training - which strives for the utmost possible reduction of the waist. The type of corset and bodice lacing became a refined mark of class; women who could not afford servants often wore front-laced bodices.|$|E

"Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker" [...] is set {{two years}} after the events of [...] Elite human soldier Commander Shepard is sent on a mission to help former squad member Liara T'Soni find an {{information}} dealer known as the Shadow Broker. Liara asks Shepard to meet her at her apartment to discuss plans regarding the location of the Shadow Broker, but when Shepard arrives, the apartment is locked down. Asari agent Tela Vasir is conducting an investigation into Liara's disappearance. Shepard and Vasir learn that Liara went to an office building to meet with an informant. Upon arriving, the building is bombed, forcing Shepard and the squad to fight their way <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> while Vasir lands {{on the roof of the}} building and proceeds downward. When Shepard reaches the office, Vasir is already there and Liara's contact is dead. Liara suddenly appears, pointing a gun at Vasir. She says that Vasir was the one who tried to kill her, and that the asari has the disk with the Shadow Broker's location, having taken it from the dead informant. In the ensuing confrontation, Vasir escapes but is pursued by Shepard and Liara, who manage to defeat her on the roof of a hotel.|$|E

50|$|Perdido Bay {{is said to}} {{have once}} had an {{estimated}} 300 natural springs bubbling <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sandy <b>bottom.</b> There were so many around the site of the Lillian bridge that when construction began, bridge engineers were appalled to see pilings sinking down below the surface, following the soft course of a natural spring. They had to devise a solution, which was building cofferdams to shore up the pilings to prevent them from sinking.|$|R
60|$|It {{seems to}} me that no man born and truthful to himself could declare that he ever saw the sea looking young as the earth looks young in spring. But some of us, {{regarding}} the ocean with understanding and affection, have seen it looking old, as if the immemorial ages had been stirred <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> undisturbed <b>bottom</b> of ooze. For it is a gale of wind that makes the sea look old.|$|R
500|$|Shardae Jobson of The Source deemed Azalea's fashion [...] "stylish" [...] and [...] "rustic".

British magazine Fact wrote that the visual was [...] "flashy" [...] and [...] "trailer park elegance", and compared it to M.I.A.'s [...] "Bad Girls" [...] (2012). Julian Rifkin of Oyster viewed it as [...] "a high class production" [...] and felt it emulated the song's lyric [...] "Valley girls giving blow jobs for Louboutins". He likened the clip's dancing to that of Beyoncé, and Grimes' [...] "Genesis" [...] (2012). Rifkin considered the production's Mid West theme to recall Lana Del Rey's [...] "Born to Die" [...] (2011). Contactmusic.com said the music video told an inspiring story of Azalea working her way <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> Jessie Peterson of MTV News called Azalea's wardrobe [...] "subtly savvy". Eric Diep of XXL stated that the clip was worth the wait, and described Azalea's [...] "sexy poses and lap dances" [...] as [...] "just {{the tip of the}} iceberg". Diep praised Azalea's story interpretation, and mentioned, [...] "Pledge allegiance to the struggle, this girl knows how to work it". Jessie Schiewe of Respect. complimented the video for revolving around Azalea and paying homage to the song's lyrical story, and praised the rapper's lap dancing scene. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly felt the video evoked the 1991 film Thelma & Louise and commended Azalea's [...] "full run of frame-grab-worthy outfits". The music video has received over 200 million views on YouTube as of January 2016.|$|E

50|$|The {{water in}} Hart Lake is quite murky due to {{suspended}} particles stirred <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shallow <b>bottom</b> by wave action. However, water clarity {{is not a}} good indicator of the lake's trophic state. The amount of nutrients in the lake is very high; nitrate and phosphorus levels indicate a hypereutrophic condition. This is counterbalanced by the chlorophyll level and related phytoplankton growth, which are typical of a mesotrophic lake. This is due to the reduced light level in the lake's cloudy waters, so overall, the lake is classified as eutrophic, with very high turbidity.|$|R
