5|$|Western Europe and North America {{were the}} {{original}} major markets for large-scale lettuce production. By the late 1900s, Asia, South America, Australia and Africa became more substantial markets. Different locations tended to prefer {{different types of}} lettuce, with butterhead prevailing in northern Europe and Great Britain, romaine in the Mediterranean and stem lettuce in China and Egypt. By the late 20th century, the preferred types began to change, with crisphead, especially iceberg, lettuce becoming the dominant type in northern Europe and Great Britain and more popular in western Europe. In the <b>US,</b> <b>no</b> one type predominated until the early 20th century, when crisphead lettuces began gaining popularity. After the 1940s, {{with the development of}} iceberg lettuce, 95 percent of the lettuce grown and consumed in the US was crisphead lettuce. By the end of the century, other types began to regain popularity and eventually made up over 30 percent of production. Stem lettuce was first developed in China, and remains primarily cultivated in that country.|$|E

The general characteristics graded are color (both hue and uniformity), firmness, maturity, varietal characteristics, texture, and shape. Fancy, the highest grade, requires the highest grade {{of color and}} an absence of blemishes, while the terms Bright, Golden, Bronze, and Russet concern solely discoloration.|$|E

25|$|He {{considered}} it {{the task of}} the artist to create beauty. How the artist did this did not really matter. But originality was no virtue; personality was. Great music, like Beethoven’s, is admired because the composer’s personality shines through; Beethoven’s daring originality is now only of historical interest. However, Ryelandt was highly critical of atonality, claiming that the modernists’ “empty game of sound combinations brings <b>us</b> <b>no</b> interior enrichment at all,” and that the value of works like Honegger’s “unforgettable” Jeanne d'Arc au bûcher lay chiefly in their tonal passages.|$|E
25|$|By 1965 {{the pool}} was {{increasingly}} unable {{to balance the}} outflow of gold reserves with buybacks. Excessive inflation of the US money supply, in part to fund the Vietnam War, led to the <b>US</b> <b>no</b> longer being able to redeem foreign-held dollars into gold, as the world's gold reserves had not grown in relation, and the payment deficit had grown to US$3 billion. Thus, the London Gold Pool came under increased pressures of failure, causing France to announce in June 1967 a withdrawal from the agreements and moving large amounts of gold from New York to Paris.|$|E

25|$|Although the Dutch {{casualty}} {{figures are}} in dispute, both Portuguese and Dutch sources {{agree that they}} suffered heavy casualties. Dutch writer Phillipus Baldaeus stated that the fighting “caused <b>us</b> <b>no</b> small loss in killed and wounded” and Portuguese writer Fernão de Queiroz gives a figure of 900 killed and a proportionate number of wounded. Captain Ribeiro, who served in Sri Lanka from 1640 to 1658 and personally met the battle participants, stated that Dutch lost “more than four hundred men”. Official Dutch records give an indirect figure; “the arrival of 350 men two days later {{was regarded as a}} welcome reinforcement to bring the army up to its original strength”.|$|E
25|$|Alain Wertheimer, son of Jacques Wertheimer, assumed {{control of}} Chanel S.A. in 1974. In the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>No.</b> 5 de Chanel was not selling well. Alain revamped Chanel No.5 sales by {{reducing}} the number of outlets carrying the fragrance from 18,000 to 12,000. He removed the perfume from drugstore shelves, and invested millions of dollars in advertisement for Chanel cosmetics. This ensured a greater sense of scarcity and exclusivity for No.5, and sales rocketed back up as demand for the fragrance increased. He used famous people to endorse the perfume — from Marilyn Monroe to Audrey Tautou. Looking for a designer who could bring the label to new heights, he persuaded Karl Lagerfeld to end his contract with fashion house Chloé.|$|E

25|$|I had not {{a dispute}} but a disquisition with Dilke, upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, {{and at once}} it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, {{especially}} in Literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take <b>us</b> <b>no</b> further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.|$|E
