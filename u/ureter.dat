5|$|Characters {{such as the}} long, narrow kidney with reflexed <b>ureter</b> {{and closed}} {{secondary}} <b>ureter,</b> the penial complex with distinct penis, which is continuous with the epiphallus, epiphallic caecum (a flagellum and an appendix), unbranched gametolytic duct, lack of vaginal accessory organs, and the basic condition of the nervous and retractor muscle systems support the inclusion of Amphidromus in the family Camaenidae. This group of snails occur {{in a wide variety}} of habitats in the tropics of Eastern Asia and Australasia, and is one of the most diverse families in the clade Stylommatophora. Though Laidlaw & Solem (1961) provided no more additional details on the anatomy of Amphidromus, subsequent studies by distinct authors, e.g., Bishop (1977) and Solem (1983), have demonstrated that the reproductive system can provide valuable data for species recognition.|$|E
5|$|Most stones form {{due to a}} {{combination}} of genetics and environmental factors. Risk factors include high urine calcium levels, obesity, certain foods, some medications, calcium supplements, hyperparathyroidism, gout and not drinking enough fluids. Stones form in the kidney when minerals in urine are at high concentration. The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms, urine testing, and medical imaging. Blood tests may also be useful. Stones are typically classified by their location: nephrolithiasis (in the kidney), ureterolithiasis (in the <b>ureter),</b> cystolithiasis (in the bladder), or by what they are made of (calcium oxalate, uric acid, struvite, cystine).|$|E

40|$|Introduction: “Difficult ureter” is a known {{problem that}} {{increases}} the complications during ureteroscopy. Objective: To categorize <b>ureters</b> according to their distensibility, and to determine whether ureteric distensibility {{is associated with the}} success of ureteroscopy and its complications. Subjects and methods: Between January 2010 and September 2012, we tested ureteral distensibility in 306 patients who had a unilateral single radiopaque ureteral stone, 6 – 20  mm in diameter. Ureteral distensibility was classified into two categories according to the maximum size of a ureteral dilator that could be introduced before ureteroscopy: non-distensible <b>ureters,</b> which admitted a dilator up to 10 Fr and distensible <b>ureters,</b> which admitted a dilator > 10 Fr. Correlations between distensibility and the success rate and complications of ureteroscopy were determined. Results: Overall, 102 patients (33. 3 %) had non-distensible <b>ureters</b> and 204 (66. 7 %) had distensible <b>ureters.</b> Distensibility was correlated with the success of ureteroscopy because initial ureteroscopy failed in 38. 2 % of non-distensible <b>ureters.</b> Ureteroscopy was successful in all distensible <b>ureters.</b> The incidence of ureteric injury was higher in non-distensible <b>ureters</b> than in distensible <b>ureters.</b> Conclusions: Our results suggest that ureteric distensibility should be tested before ureteroscopy. Primary ureteroscopy is recommended in distensible <b>ureters</b> because of its low complication rates and favorable outcome.

40|$|Sixty one {{patients}} with primary vesicoureteric reflux were treated by endoscopic injection of Mentor Polytef paste. Seventy {{six of the}} 94 treated <b>ureters</b> showed complete disappearance of vesicoureteric reflux after one injection. Eight refluxing <b>ureters</b> required a second injection, one required a third, and one a fourth. Six <b>ureters</b> showed improvement in the grade of reflux after the first injection. Two <b>ureters</b> did not show {{any change in the}} grade of reflux after endoscopic injection. The amount of paste injected to correct reflux in the 94 <b>ureters</b> varied from 0. 1 to 1. 0 ml (mean 0. 33 ml). Patients were followed up for three to 25 months (mean 13. 4 months). Follow up micturating cystograms in the 94 <b>ureters</b> showed absence of reflux in 83. Eleven <b>ureters</b> showed recurrence of reflux. Recurrence of reflux was attributed to early technical difficulties and to insufficient amounts of polytef paste used in some cases. Follow up urograms did not show evidence of ureteric obstruction in the treated <b>ureters.</b> Endoscopic injection of polytef paste is a safe, simple, and effective procedure for primary vesicoureteric reflux and averts the need for open operation...|$|R

25|$|Urinary incontinence* is leakage of urine, usually due to {{incompetence}} of the urethral sphincter {{in adult}} dogs and ectopic <b>ureter</b> (a congenital {{condition in which}} the <b>ureter</b> enters the urinary tract posterior to the urethral sphincter) in puppies. In adult dogs it is most commonly seen in large spayed females. The lack of estrogens in spayed dogs {{has been linked to}} development of incontinence. Replacement of estrogens, phenylpropanolamine, and surgery have all been used for treatment.|$|E
25|$|The tip, or papilla, of each pyramid empties urine into a minor calyx; minor calyces empty into major calyces, {{and major}} calyces empty into the renal pelvis. This becomes the <b>ureter.</b> At the hilum, the <b>ureter</b> and renal vein exit the kidney and the renal artery enters. Hilar fat and lymphatic tissue with lymph nodes {{surrounds}} these structures. The hilar fat is contiguous with a fat-filled cavity called the renal sinus. The renal sinus collectively contains the renal pelvis and calyces and separates these structures from the renal medullary tissue.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>ureters</b> are muscular ducts that propel urine {{from the}} kidneys to the urinary bladder. In the human adult, the <b>ureters</b> are usually 25-30 cm (10-12 in) long. In humans, the <b>ureters</b> {{arise from the}} renal pelvis on the medial aspect of each kidney before {{descending}} towards the bladder {{on the front of}} the psoas major muscle. The <b>ureters</b> cross the pelvic brim near the bifurcation of the iliac arteries (which they run over). This [...] "pelviureteric junction" [...] is a common site for the impaction of kidney stones (the other being the uteterovesical valve). The <b>ureters</b> run posteriorly on the lateral walls of the pelvis. They then curve anteriormedially to enter the bladder through the back, at the vesicoureteric junction, running within the wall of the bladder for a few centimeters. The backflow of urine is prevented by valves known as ureterovesical valves. In the female, the <b>ureters</b> pass through the mesometrium on the way to the bladder.|$|R
25|$|The {{collecting}} {{system is the}} structure that collects urine directly from the kidney tissue and routes it {{by way of the}} <b>ureter</b> to the bladder. Structural renal abnormalities are rare in both sexes.|$|E
25|$|Post operatively, kidneys are {{periodically}} {{assessed by}} ultrasound to assess for the imaging and physiologic changes that accompany transplant rejection. Imaging also allows evaluation of supportive {{structures such as}} the anastomosed transplant artery, vein, and <b>ureter,</b> to ensure they are stable in appearance.|$|E
25|$|The {{scarring}} of {{the small}} blood vessels, called capillary sclerosis, is the initial lesion of analgesic nephropathy. Found in the renal pelvis, <b>ureter,</b> and capillaries supplying the nephrons, capillary sclerosis is thought to lead to renal papillary necrosis and, in turn, chronic interstitial nephritis.|$|E
40|$|A 65 -year-old man {{underwent}} radical cystectomy and cutaneous ureterostomy for bladder cancer. Because {{the patient}} had left complete duplex <b>ureters,</b> we modified the Toyoda method to construct the tubeless cutaneous ureterostomy with a unilateral stomal creation. The adhesive portion of both ureteral walls in duplex <b>ureters</b> was simultaneously cut approximately 5 mm from the distal end longitudinally, and the common sheath of the cut portion of the <b>ureters</b> was cut approximately 5 mm longitudinally in order to separate the two <b>ureters.</b> This procedure was repeated to make a“fish-mouth”aperture. Two opened ureteral walls were formed into {{the upper and lower}} plates of the Toyoda method stoma, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a surgical procedure of the tubeless cutaneous ureterostomy in complete duplex <b>ureters...</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{inducing}} the metanephric mesenchyme {{the lower}} {{portions of the}} nephric duct will migrate caudally (downward) and connect with the bladder, thereby forming the <b>ureters.</b> The <b>ureters</b> will carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder for excretion from the fetus into the amniotic sac. As the fetus develops, the torso elongates and the kidneys rotate and migrate upwards within the abdomen which causes {{the length of the}} <b>ureters</b> to increase.|$|R
40|$|Ectopy of the <b>ureters</b> is a {{congenital}} malformation {{in which the}} termination of one or both <b>ureters</b> is elsewhere than in the trigone area of the bladder. It {{is the most common}} cause of urinary incontinence in young dogs. In dogs with ectopic <b>ureters</b> the ureteric bud arises too far cranially on the mesonephric duct. This lengthens the distance for the bud to reach the bladder, and the <b>ureters</b> will open more caudally in the urinary tract. Diagnosis can be made with radiographic contrast studies, ultrasound, cystoscopy and urethroscopy and computed tomography (CT). There are several techniques described for surgical treatment, but the aim is repositioning of the ureteral orifices into the bladder lumen. Ectopic <b>ureters</b> are more commonly diagnosed in females. It is considered to be hereditary because of the increased prevalence in some breeds, for example in the Labrador retriever. Identification of the involved genes can help with early diagnosis and screening of dogs for breeding. In previous studies there are strong candidate genes found. The purpose of this study is to identify the causal mutations and to confirm if there is a correlation between the mutations and ectopic <b>ureters</b> or urinary incontinence...|$|R
25|$|Birds have {{relatively}} large, elongated kidneys, {{each of which}} is divided into three or more distinct lobes. The lobes consists of several small, irregularly arranged, lobules, each centred on a branch of the <b>ureter.</b> Birds have small glomeruli, but about twice as many nephrons as similarly sized mammals.|$|E
25|$|The kidneys of {{reptiles}} {{consist of a}} number of lobules arranged in a broadly linear pattern. Each lobule contains a single branch of the <b>ureter</b> in its centre, into which the collecting ducts empty. Reptiles have relatively few nephrons compared with other amniotes of a similar size, possibly because of their lower metabolic rate.|$|E
25|$|Fibroids {{that lead}} to heavy vaginal {{bleeding}} lead to anemia and iron deficiency. Due to pressure effects gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and bloatedness are possible. Compression of the <b>ureter</b> may lead to hydronephrosis. Fibroids may also present alongside endometriosis, which itself may cause infertility. Adenomyosis may be mistaken for or coexist with fibroids.|$|E
