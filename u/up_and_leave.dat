5|$|On 28 October 1797 Brock {{purchased}} {{the rank of}} lieutenant-colonel, and became acting commanding officer of the regiment, assuming substantive command on 22 March 1798 with the retirement of Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Keppel. The rank was apparently bought cheaply; his predecessor from whom he {{purchased the}} rank was advised to sell <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> the army rather than face a court martial and probable dismissal.|$|E
5|$|Waylon Smithers {{is offered}} {{a job at the}} Globex Corporation. When he refuses, the offer is passed down to Homer, the next-longest-employed {{individual}} at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He informs his family that the new job pays better and provides free health-care for the family, but involves moving to Cypress Creek. The Simpson family initially opposes the move, but after they watch a promotional video about the planned community, they agree that it is much better than Springfield. Abandoning their house, the Simpsons pack <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> town.|$|E
5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour to pack <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot {{and fell to the}} ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E

25|$|In some countries, medical {{personnel}} may be slow {{to respond to}} accidents. At the 2000 World Championships in Nice, France, a pair skater who had been injured in a lift accident lay on the ice for several minutes and had to get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> the ice on his own before being offered medical attention.|$|E
25|$|On 28 April 1975, North Vietnamese forces fought {{their way}} into the {{outskirts}} of the capital. Later that afternoon, as President Minh finished his acceptance speech, in which he called for an immediate cease-fire and peace talks, a formation of five A-37s, captured from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, bombed Tân Sơn Nhứt. As Biên Hòa fell, General Nguyễn Văn Toàn, the III Corps commander, fled to Saigon, saying that most of the top ARVN leadership had virtually resigned themselves to defeat. The inauguration of Minh had served as a signal to South Vietnamese officers who would not compromise with the communists. They began to pack <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave,</b> or commit suicide to avoid capture.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{students}} and professors persuaded others still sitting on the lower tiers of the Monument to get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave,</b> while soldiers beat them with clubs and gunbutts and prodded them with bayonets. Witnesses heard bursts of gunfire. At about 5:10 am, {{the students}} began to leave the Monument. They linked hands and marched through a corridor to the southeast, though some departed through the north. Those who refused to leave were beaten by soldiers and ordered to join the departing procession. Having removed the students from the square, soldiers were ordered to relinquish their ammunition, after which they were allowed a short reprieve from 7:00 am to 9:00 am. The soldiers were then ordered to clear the square of all debris left over from the student occupation. The debris was either piled and burnt on the square, or placed in large plastic bags that were then airlifted away by military helicopters. After the cleanup of the square was completed the troops stationed at The Great Hall of the People remained confined within for the next nine days. During this time the soldiers were left to sleep on the floors and fed a single packet of instant noodles split between three men daily. Officers apparently suffered no such deprivation, and were served regular meals apart from their troops.|$|E

500|$|In {{an article}} by the South China Morning Post, it concludes, [...] "with {{mounting}} pressure and dwindling hopes of fulfilling both career and personal ambitions at home, for women such as Xu the urge to pack <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> only grows stronger with time. Without women such as her, though, the mainland will be left with not only a weaker economy, but an even greater pool of frustrated leftover men." ...|$|E
500|$|Marvin Digs, which Bakshi {{conceived}} as a [...] "flower child picture", was not completed {{the way he had}} intended: It [...] "was going to have curse words and sex scenes, and a lot more than that. [...] Of course, they wouldn't let me do that." [...] He described the disappointing result as a [...] "typical 1967 limited-animation theatrical". Animation historian Michael Barrier called the film [...] "an offensively bad picture, the kind that makes people who love animation get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> the theater in disgust". Production of Mighty Heroes ended when Bakshi left Terrytoons.|$|E

500|$|All four modules of the S-series were {{included}} {{as part of}} the Dungeons of Dread hardcover collection, released on March 19, 2013. Lawrence Schick wrote in the foreword: [...] "The dungeon of the demi-lich Acererak was, for Gary, a kind of thought experiment: If an undead sorcerer really wanted to keep his tomb from being plundered by greedy adventurers, how would he do it? The answer, of course, was to defend the crypt with tricks and traps designed not to challenge the intruders but to kill them dead. And furthermore, to do it in ways so horrific that all but the most determined party would give <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> well enough alone." ...|$|E
500|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob feels neglected and ends up a nuisance {{when he tries to}} hang out with the other characters. They all angrily call him [...] "Idiot Boy", so SpongeBob decides to pack <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> Bikini Bottom. Along the way, he accidentally bumps his head, making him lose his memory. SpongeBob wanders away into a new place called New Kelp City and attempts to get a new job, unaware he is becoming a target for a criminal gang known as The Bubble Poppin' Boys, while Patrick, Sandy and a reluctant Squidward try to find him.|$|E
500|$|A {{civilian}} {{exodus from}} the city had begun well before the British fleet arrived in the harbor. The arrival the previous February of the first Continental Army troops in the city had prompted some people to pack <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave,</b> including Loyalists who were specifically targeted by the army and Patriots. [...] The capture of Long Island only accelerated the abandonment of the city. During the Continental Army's occupation of the city, many abandoned buildings were appropriated for the army's use. [...] When the British arrived in the city, the property of Patriots was confiscated for the British army's use. Despite this, housing and other demands of the military occupation significantly strained the city's available building stock.|$|E

500|$|Some of {{the critics}} were divided on Rihanna's {{decision}} to collaborate with Brown again. Toronto Stars Lucas Oleniuk stated that [...] "Nobody's Business" [...] {{is not a bad}} track, [...] "it’s one of the catchiest and freshest-sounding here — but the troubling subtext is as irksome as the irony of titling a song that proudly makes the pair’s business everybody's." [...] Bernard Perusse of Montreal Gazette noted that although it is a pretty fair R smoker, there is something nauseating and sinister about the song and that is its message. Being more critical towards the collaboration, Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times wrote that the track represents a sad inversion of the 1965 single [...] "I Got You Babe" [...] by Sonny & Cher, further noting [...] " [...] Instead of singing about connection, true love and wanting to shout it to the world, the song features a convicted abuser and the woman he assaulted asking everyone to shut <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> them alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Grissom {{announced}} his retirement just as evidence comes to light that The Dick and Jane Killer, a serial killer from the 1990s currently serving two life sentences, did not act alone, and that his accomplice had begun killing again. Rather than leave {{in the middle of}} a case, Grissom stayed on to help solve it, and ultimately proved instrumental in saving the life of a woman who would have been the killer's latest victim. The case closed, Grissom, having already had a series of one-on-one farewells with his co-workers, silently left the crime lab and departed for Costa Rica for a reunion with fiancée Sara Sidle, an allusion perhaps to his comments in a [...] episode that when he left, people would not throw a party for him because he was not the sort of person who people would get deeply involved with. He also says to Warrick in season two ("Ellie") that when he left there would not be a cake in the break room—he would just pick <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave.</b>|$|E
500|$|Herman Melville's Moby-Dick is {{the most}} notable artistic {{antecedent}} to Jaws. The character of Quint strongly resembles Captain Ahab, the obsessed captain of the Pequod who devotes his life to hunting a sperm whale. Quint's monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the Orca, is named after the only natural enemy of the white shark. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar {{to the death of}} Ahab in Melville's novel. A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg's draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the film version of Moby-Dick; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> the theater (Wesley Strick's screenplay for the 1991 remake of Cape Fear features a similar scene). However, the scene from Moby-Dick could not be licensed from the film's star, Gregory Peck, its copyright holder. Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea: [...] "Jaws is... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway." ...|$|E

2500|$|The school's principal, Gwendolyn Tose'-Rigell, explained, [...] "I don't {{think anyone}} could have handled it better. What would it have served if he had jumped {{out of his chair}} and ran out of the room?" [...] Some of the schoolchildren, now grown, have {{expressed}} similar views; Mariah Williams, one of the students, stated in 2011 that, [...] "I'm just glad he didn't get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> because then I would have been more scared and confused." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opechancanough {{withdrew his}} warriors, {{believing that the}} English would behave as Native Americans would when defeated: pack <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave,</b> or learn their lesson and respect {{the power of the}} Powhatan. [...] Following the event, Opechancanough told the Patawomeck, who were not part of the Confederacy and had {{remained}} neutral, that he expected [...] "before the end of two Moones there should not be an Englishman in all their Countries." [...] He misunderstood the English colonists and their backers overseas.|$|E
