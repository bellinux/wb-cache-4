5|$|That {{afternoon}} three {{troops of}} tanks from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, {{were sent to}} reinforce the Black Watch, but they had only just started to move towards the Château when three tanks were destroyed by hidden German self-propelled guns. The other tanks were withdrawn being unable to deploy in the wooded ground around the Château. The {{rest of the day}} and night passed without another attack, but the Germans sent out reconnaissance patrols to establish the exact location of the British positions and German armoured vehicles could be heard moving <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> during the night.|$|E
5|$|Following its losses, the 66th Division {{was reduced}} to cadre early in May; which meant that {{infantry}} battalions were cut to ten officers and about 45 men, the surplus being sent to base depots; the artillery, engineer and machine-gun units were distributed among other formations. The divisional artillery was attached to XIX Corps during the Battle of the Avre on 4 April and with XI Corps at the Battle of the Lys later in the month. During the summer, Bethell continued planning for the rebuilding of the division, having recruited a staff he felt he could work with, expecting that experienced men would become available as drafts returned from the Mediterranean. Overseas divisions there had suffered fewer casualties and the reduction from four to three battalions per brigade meant {{that large numbers of}} men would be returning. While reinforcements were assembled, the divisional cadres of the 66th Division and the 39th Division were used to train five American divisions in the British zone. The training process was complicated by a rigid schedule laid down by the American high command, who strongly objected to any deviation from their plans. In July, the American divisions moved <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and British troops began to arrive from Salonika and Palestine, though the assembly of the division was delayed by the returning men being given home leave and having to spend time acclimatising.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 1916, as the AIF's {{infantry}} divisions {{were transferred}} to Europe, the battalion sailed from Alexandria aboard the HMT Corsican. It arrived at Marseilles, France, on 5 April and then moved by train to Flêtre where it was billeted until the 19th when it moved to Sailly, where it commemorated Anzac Day on 25 April. In mid-May, {{after a period of}} acclimatisation and training to prepare them for the European battlefield, the 11th Battalion moved <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line around Petillon in the Fleurbaix sector, with a strength of 27 officers and 929 other ranks. A further draft of reinforcements, totalling 69 men all ranks, arrived on 25 May, and on 30 May the battalion had its first experience of combat on the Western Front. Late that evening, German artillery bombarded the Allied line around the Cordonnerie salient, before infantry launched a raid on the 11th Battalion's trenches. In the fighting that followed the 11th Battalion lost four men captured, 37 killed and 70 wounded.|$|E

5|$|Originally a garden, {{the demand}} for more {{accommodation}} for undergraduates in the early 18th century resulted in two free-standing blocks being built. The first block erected was the Robinson Building on the east side, built in 1720 by Bishop Robinson {{at the suggestion of}} his wife, as the inscription over the door records. Its twin block, the Carter Building, was erected on the west side in 1729, {{as a result of a}} benefaction by Provost Carter. The two buildings stood for nearly a hundred years as detached blocks in the garden, and the architectural elements of the First quad are repeated on them — only here the seven gables are all alike. Between 1817 and 1819, they were joined <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> quad with their present, rather incongruous connecting links. In the link to the Robinson Building, two purpose-built rooms have been incorporated – the Champneys Room, designed by Weldon Champneys, the nephew of Basil Champneys, and the Benefactors Room, a panelled room honouring benefactors of the college. A Gothic oriel window, belonging to the Provost's Lodgings, was added to the Carter Building in 1826.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Carey driving up {{to a large}} movie theater, the Los Angeles Theatre in {{downtown}} Los Angeles, with several of her female friends. As they pull <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> doors, they tell Carey that her boyfriend is inside with another woman, leading her {{to try to convince}} them to abort the plan of confrontation. After convincing her, they enter the theater and begin a series of small dance routines alongside some of the theater employees. As the music begins, scenes of them dancing and Carey entering the movie projection room inter-cut. Carey sits behind her boyfriend (played by Jerry O'Connell) and the woman he is cheating with, and spy on them in a comedic way with her female lackeys. Soon after, the still unidentified woman walks towards the bathroom, prompting Carey to follow her during a short interlude in the video. After running into each other by the washroom, the woman appears to be Carey sporting a short brown wig and red seductive clothing. Carey pokes her, starting a large brawl in between the two women. Afterwards, Carey appears to have defeated the woman named Bianca, and heads back towards the movie room. During this scene, Jay-Z's rap verse is played, while an animated clip of Jay-Z and Carey is projected onto the screen. Later a version of the video leaked where Jay-Z was rapping his verse in a jacuzzi. During the verse, Carey's friends begin throwing popcorn and other candies at O'Connell, prompting a small food fight in between them. As they halt their attack on him, Carey walks towards O'Connell's seat and acts as though she is Bianca. After she sits next to him and he notices who it is, Carey spills a large soda on his lap and bids him farewell, leaving the theater with her friends smiling.|$|E
25|$|Two {{blocks from}} the crime scene, Officer Don Fouke, {{responding}} to the call, observed a white man, walking along the sidewalk and stepping onto a stairway leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> yard {{of one of the}} homes {{on the north side of}} the street; the encounter lasted only five to ten seconds.|$|E

25|$|The American {{advantage}} in numbers (as high as 5:1), armor, mobility, and air support was greatly reduced by weather and terrain.

25|$|The capitol is {{exceptionally}} well preserved, {{which is a}} consequence of its inclusion in the Byzantine fortification. A series of eleven stairs lead <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> portico. The temple front’s Corinthian columns are eight metres tall, on top of which is the perfectly preserved pediment. The pediment bears a depiction of emperor Antoninus Pius’s elevation to godhood. The emperor is being carried by an eagle.|$|E

60|$|Ormersfield Park was extensive, ranging into fine broken ground, rocky and {{overgrown}} with brushwood; but it bore {{the marks of}} retrenchment; there was hardly a large timber tree on the estate, enclosures had been begun and deserted, and the deer had been sold off {{to make room for}} farmers' cattle, which grazed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> very <b>front</b> door.|$|R

25|$|The garden {{forecourt}} is a flat {{public space}} fronting Boundary Street. The garden {{is laid out}} in sharp and dynamic lines of concrete, defining contrasting flat areas of mature trees, grass, paths and water to create a bold, abstract effect. A wide entrance path from the street bisects the garden, bridging across a pond and stepping <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> portico entrance. The Red Cube, a large metal sculpture, stands on the path {{in front of a}} marble slab engraved to commemorate the opening of the building.|$|E

25|$|After {{five months}} of {{training}} on Salisbury Plain, the battalion arrived in France in November 1916, as the 3rd Division {{was transferred to the}} front {{over the course of several}} months. The division's move was not complete until February 1917, but the battalion was moved <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line soon after its arrival, taking up a position on 27 November 1916. Over Christmas, the Australians endured the worst winter Europe experienced in 40 years, and for the next two years the 34th Battalion served on the Western Front until the end of the war.|$|E
25|$|The {{southbound}} platform has {{a part-time}} fare control {{area near the}} south end.

It is the southernmost station on the Lexington Avenue Line to be directly under Lexington Avenue itself. South from here, the line shifts slightly westward to Park Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Railroads {{proposed}} the end-of-train device (EOT or ETD) as an alternative. An ETD could {{be attached to}} the rear of the train to detect the train's air brake pressure and report any problems to the locomotive. The ETD also detects movement of the train upon start-up and radios this information to the engineers so they know all of the slack is out of the couplings and additional power could be applied. The machines also have blinking red lights to warn following trains that a train is ahead. With the introduction of the ETD, the conductor moved <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the train with the engineer.|$|E

60|$|He got <b>up</b> {{and went}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door, and opened it, and looked about him. But {{he was looking}} for nothing. His eyes were full of tears, and he didn't care <b>to</b> wipe <b>the</b> drops away in her presence.|$|R
60|$|And so on. You couldn't {{make out}} what the preacher said any more, {{on account of the}} {{shouting}} and crying.

25|$|The 60th Division {{was next}} {{transferred}} to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force for the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The 2/19th left Lake Doiran on 1 June and marched back to Salonika where it embarked on 10 June. After a period of training and acclimatisation in the Canal Zone, the battalion moved <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> in July. On 31 October the battalion was with 180th Brigade in divisional reserve for the Battle of Beersheba, but the attack was so successful that it never came into action. On 6 November the 2/19th {{was one of the}} attacking battalions that captured the Kauwukah position during the Battle of Hareira and Sheria. The Sheria position remaining untaken, the brigade attacked again the following day, and the 2/19th suffered heavy casualties, the acting commanding officer, Major A.W. Gray, being killed.|$|E
25|$|Roberts backed {{a pickup}} truck <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the Amish schoolhouse and entered the school at {{approximately}} 10:25a.m. EDT, shortly after the children had returned from recess. He asked the teacher, Emma Mae Zook, and the students if they had seen a missing clevis pin on the road. Survivors said that Roberts was mumbling his words and was not making direct eye contact. After the occupants of the classroom denied seeing a clevis pin, Roberts walked out to his truck and reappeared in the classroom holding a Springfield XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items into the classroom {{from the back of}} his pickup. Zook and her mother, who was visiting the schoolhouse, took this opportunity to escape the school and ran toward a nearby farm to get help. Roberts saw them leave, and ordered one of the boys to stop them, threatening to shoot everyone if the women got away.|$|E
25|$|The {{battalion}} {{was withdrawn}} from the peninsula in December 1915 {{along with the rest}} of the Allied forces after the decision was made to abandon the campaign. After this, a further period of training in Egypt was undertaken as the AIF was reorganised and expanded from two infantry divisions to five. In March 1916, the 17th Battalion was sent to France as the AIF's infantry divisions were transferred to the Western Front. The battalion moved <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line in April and took over the forward position in the eastern Armentières section. It was in June, during the prelude to the Battle of the Somme, when the battalion was positioned in the line around Armentières, that Private William Jackson earned the battalion's only Victoria Cross of the war. Later, the 17th Battalion took part in the first major battle at Pozières, serving in the line twice at this time between July and August. A period of respite followed after this, as the 17th was moved north to Belgium {{along with the rest of}} the 2nd Division, remaining there until October when they were transferred back to the Somme. For the remainder of the year they undertook defensive duties along the front, although they were not involved in any major attacks.|$|E
