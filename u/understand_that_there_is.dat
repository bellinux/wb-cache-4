25|$|In {{a popular}} {{personal}} report called Tre dagar med Victoria, which profiled her work during a three-day period that aired on TV4 in December 2004, Victoria commented on criticism directed at Westling, “Many unfair things are written. I <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> speculation, but some day justice {{will be done}} there, too.” Victoria also gave her opinion that happiness is important, and that these days {{it is not so}} much about background and pedigree but about two people who have to live with each other. She said that if they are not happy and comfortable with each other, it is impossible to do a good job.|$|E

He was not noted for tackling, which {{sometimes}} caused frustration for his managers; Colin Todd remarked wistfully in 2001 that [...] "Georgi has to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an art to tackling". Unwillingness to tackle and accusations {{of a lack of}} effort were also the source of Joe Royle's omission of Kinkladze from his Manchester City side.|$|E

"The {{house will}} <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{no part of}} the Home Secretary's duty which throws greater {{responsibility}} upon him or is indeed more painful, then that which has to be exercised in connection with the prerogative of mercy. Of course, any man would be only too glad to find a scintilla of evidence or reason, or I might say to invent a reason, which would enable him to save a human life. But my duty, as I understand it, is to act in accordance with the law and the traditions of my office.|$|E

500|$|Kierkegaard {{has this}} seducer speak again in Stages on Life's Way where he explores {{some of the}} {{possibilities}} and then once more where he tries to explain that misunderstanding can be {{the root of the}} unity of the tragic and the comic. [...] "Anyone who, when he is twenty years old, does not <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a categorical imperative — Enjoy — is a fool, and anyone who does not start doing it is a Christiansfelder. .... Our young friend will always remain on the outside. Victor is a fanatic; Constantin has paid too much for his intellect; the Fashion Designer is a madman. All four of you after the same girl {{will turn out to be}} a fizzle! Have enough fanaticism to idealize, enough appetite to join in the jolly conviviality of desire, enough understanding to break off in exactly the same way death breaks off, enough rage to want to enjoy it all over again — then one is the favorite of the gods and of the girls." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Raëlian Movement {{promoted}} 2004 as the [...] "year of atheism". [...] On 11 December 2004, Raëlians {{marched in}} the Atheist Convention in Rome. [...] One of them said, [...] " [...] {{children need to}} <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no Santa, people need to realize there is no God." [...] In YouTube, Raëlians have posted videos in denial of the Holy Spirit {{in response to the}} Blasphemy Challenge. [...] Despite their anti-religious leaning, Raëlians—who are philosophical materialists—believe that a trained mind can achieve telepathic communication with extraterrestrial Elohim.|$|E
2500|$|Actually, {{the locus}} classicus, the best {{formulation}} of this, was by an {{ambassador to the}} United Nations, Abba Eban, ... He advised the American Jewish community that they had two tasks to perform. One task was to show that criticism of the policy, what he called anti-Zionism — that means actually criticisms of {{the policy of the}} state of Israel — were anti-Semitism. That’s the first task. Second task, if the criticism was made by Jews, their task was to show that it’s neurotic self-hatred, needs psychiatric treatment. Then he gave two examples of the latter category. One was I.F. Stone. The other was me. So, we have to be treated for our psychiatric disorders, and non-Jews have to be condemned for anti-Semitism, if they’re critical of the state of Israel. That’s understandable why Israeli propaganda would take this position. I don’t particularly blame Abba Eban for doing what ambassadors are sometimes supposed to do. But we ought to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no sensible charge. No sensible charge. There’s nothing to respond to. It’s not a form of anti-Semitism. It’s simply criticism of the criminal actions of a state, period.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{addressed}} {{this idea of}} proving God in this discourse. He says, [...] "When one grows older, everything becomes so miserable. God in heaven has to sit {{and wait for the}} decision on his fate, whether he exists, and finally he comes into existence {{with the help of a}} few demonstrations; human beings have to put up with waiting for the matter to be decided. Suppose that a person died before that time; suppose that when the matter was finally decided he was not in the practice of thinking about God as a Creator and the joy over that was all gone!" [...] He also said, [...] "Even though the Preacher ordinarily speaks rigorously to people, he nevertheless is so courteous as to assume that you <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a God is not so vain as to think that he has invented the existence of God. He had already made his decision about Christianity as early as 1835 when he wrote:it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown. I will remember that philosopher's method of having his disciples keep silent for three years; then I dare say it will come. Just as one does not begin a feast at sunrise but at sundown, just so in the spiritual world one must work forward for some time before the sun really shines for us and rises in all its glory; for although it is true as it says that God lets his sun shine upon the good and the evil and lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust, it is not so in the spiritual world. So let the die be cast — I am crossing the Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, but I will not renounce it. I will not lament the past — why lament? I will work energetically and not waste time in regrets, like the person stuck in a bog and first calculating how far he has sunk without recognizing that during the time he spends on that he is sinking still deeper. I will hurry along the path I have found and shout to everyone I meet: Do not look back as Lot's wife did, but remember that we are struggling up a hill.|$|E
