500|$|Two years later, in 2009, a Finding Of No Significant Impact by the Federal Transit Administration {{found that}} a {{proposed}} entrance at {{the northeast corner of}} Second Avenue and 72nd Street was unfeasible, as was the proposed single sidewalk elevator at the southeast corner. The northeast-corner entrance, within the 305 East 72nd Street apartment building, would have encroached into a portion of CVS Pharmacy's ground-floor retail space as well as the apartment building's basement, which contained its laundry room and several of its utility intake pipes. Building the northeast-corner entrance would have forced the owners of 305 East 72nd Street to move their laundry room and utilities into the retail space occupied by CVS, so plans for the northeast-corner entrance were canceled. The site for the sidewalk elevator on the southeast corner turned out to be located close to a high-pressure steam main that was [...] in diameter. After a 2007 steam main explosion in Midtown, <b>utility</b> <b>provider</b> Consolidated Edison changed its guidelines for clearance around high-pressure mains, which meant that the elevator was now too close to the main. Thus, the plan was revised to place the elevator inside a building. Of the three alternatives presented for combining the two entrances, the MTA chose an alternative in which there would be five elevators inside a building at the southeast corner of Second Avenue and 72nd Street. This required the demolition of 300 East 72nd Street so that a new building for the five elevators could be built.|$|E
