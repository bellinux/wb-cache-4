40|$|A natural seesaw {{mechanism}} for obtaining the observed size of SM neutrino masses can arise in a warped extra dimensional/composite Higgs framework. In a previous paper, we initiated {{the study of}} signals at the LHC for the associated ∼ TeV mass SM singlet neutrinos, within a canonical model of SU(2) _L × SU(2) _R × U(1) _ B - L (LR) symmetry in the composite sector, as motivated by consistency with the EW precision tests. Here, we investigate LHC signals in a different region of parameter space for the same model, where production of singlet neutrinos can occur from particles beyond those in usual LR models. Specifically, we assume that composite (<b>B</b> - L) <b>gauge</b> boson is lighter than all {{the others in the}} EW sector. We show that the composite (<b>B</b> - L) <b>gauge</b> boson can acquire a significant coupling to light quarks simply via mixing with elementary hypercharge gauge boson. Thus, the singlet neutrino can be pair-produced via decays of (<b>B</b> - L) <b>gauge</b> boson, without a charged current counterpart. Furthermore, there is no decay for (<b>B</b> - L) <b>gauge</b> boson directly into dibosons, unlike for the usual case of W_R^± and Z^'. Independently of the above extension of the EW sector, we analyze production of singlet neutrinos in decays of composite partners of SU(2) _L doublet leptons, which are absent in the usual LR models. In turn, these doublet leptons can be produced in composite W_L decays. We show that 4 - 5 σ signal can be achieved for both cases described above for the following spectrum with 3000 fb^- 1 luminosity: 2 - 2. 5 TeV composite gauge bosons, 1 TeV composite doublet lepton (for the second case) and 500 - 750 GeV singlet neutrino.

The same set of holomorphic blocks realizes S 3 b and S 2 × S 1 partition functions but the two cases involve different inner products, the S-pairing and the id-pairing respectively. We define a class of q-deformed CFT correlators where conformal blocks are controlled by a deformation of Virasoro symmetry and are paired by S-pairing and id-pairing respectively. Applying the bootstrap approach to a class of degenerate correlators we are able to derive three-point functions. We show that degenerate correlators can be mapped to 3 d partition functions while the crossing symmetry of CFT correlators corresponds to the flop sym-metry of 3 d gauge theories. We explore how non-degenerate q-deformed correlators are related to 5 d partition functions. We argue that id-pairing correlators are associated to the superconformal index on S 4 × S 1 while S-pairing three-point function factors capture the one-loop part of S 5 partition functions.

Following the idea of Glashow-Salam-Ward-Weinberg, we gauge the groups T_ 4 × (SU_ 3) _color× SU_ 2 × U_ 1 × U_ 1 b on equal-footing, so that we have the total-unified gauge covariant derivative _μ = _μ - igϕ_μ^ν p_ν+ig_sG_μ^a(^a/ 2) +ifW_μ^kt^k + if' U_μt_o + ig_bB_μ. The generators of the external T_ 4 group have the representation p_μ=i_μ, which differs from other generators of all internal groups, which have constant matrix representations. Consequently, the total-unified model leads to the following new results: (a) All internal (SU_ 3) _color, SU_ 2, U_ 1 and baryonic U_ 1 <b>b</b> <b>gauge</b> symmetries have extremely small violations due to the gravitational interaction.

In Part II, {{the role of the}} windshield and gauge aerodynamics, as well as the varying flow field due to the turbulence generated by the shield–gauge configuration, in reducing the catch efficiency is investigated. This builds on the computational fluid dynamics results obtained in Part I, where the airflow patterns in the proximity of an unshielded and single Alter shielded Geonor T- 200 <b>B</b> <b>gauge</b> are obtained using both time-independent [Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) ] and time-dependent [large-eddy simulation (LES) ] approaches.

The collection efficiency obtained with the LES approach is generally lower than the one obtained with the RANS approach. This is because {{of the impact of the}} LES-resolved turbulence above the gauge orifice rim. The comparison between the collection efficiency values obtained in case of shielded and unshielded gauge validates the choice of installing a single Alter shield in a windy environment.

The modifications induced by the gauge and the windshield onto the space–time patterns of the undisturbed airflow deviate the snowflake trajectories. In Part I, the disturbed air velocity field {{in the vicinity of}} shielded and unshielded gauge configurations is investigated. In Part II, the airflow is the basis for a particle tracking model of snowflake trajectories to estimate the collection efficiency. A Geonor T- 200 <b>B</b> <b>gauge</b> inside a single Alter shield is simulated for wind speeds varying from 1 to 8 m s− 1. Both time-averaged and time-dependent computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed, based on Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and large-eddy simulation (LES) models, respectively. A shear stress tensor k–Ω model (where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and Ω is the turbulent specific dissipation rate) is used for the RANS formulation and solved within a finite-volume method. The LES is implemented with a Smagorinsky subgrid-scale method that models the subgrid stresses as a gradient-diffusion process. The RANS simulations confirm the attenuation of the airflow velocity above the gauge when using a single Alter shield, but the generated turbulence above the orifice rim is underestimated. The intensity and spatial extension of the LES-resolved turbulent region show a dependency on the wind speed that was not detected by the RANS.

In order to mimic different trends to vitrification, a factor <b>B</b> <b>gauging</b> the strength of the bond potential with respect to the long-range potential (i. e. the intramolecular or intermolecular potential between indirectly bonded beads) has been introduced. (A higher value of B leads to a preference for the highest bond lengths and a higher total energy, implying a greater tendency to vitrify.) Different cases have been considered for linear chains: no long-range potential, no bond potential and several choices for B. Furthermore, we have considered two distinct values of B for alternate bonds in linear chains. In the case of the branched chains, molecules with different values of B for bonds in the main chain and in the branches have also been investigated. The possible presence of crystallization has been characterized by calculating the collective light scattering function of the different samples after annealing at a convenient temperature below the onset of crystallization. It is concluded that crystallization is inherited more efficiently in the systems with branched chains and also for higher values of B. The branched molecules with the highest B values in the main chain bonds exhibit two distinct transitions in the heating curves which may be associated with two glass transitions. This behavior has been detected experimentally for chains with relatively long flexible branches. Comment: 1 Table, 12 Figure...|$|R

We discuss to which settings the superconformal method is restricted and distinguish between settings with not more than 8 supersymmetries for which off-shell formulations exist and settings with 16 supersymmetries for which only on-shell formulations exist. In the second part we focus on higher derivative deformations of supergravity theories. An overview is given of the different superconformal higher derivative invariants that have been constructed in the literature. As an example we consider the deformation of the Salam-Sezgin model by a supersymmetric completion of the Riemann tensor squared.

This elegant renormalizable construction singles out top quark sector (instead {{of all other}} light fermions) to join the new SU(2) gauge force. It predicts extra vector-like spectator quarks (T, <b>B),</b> new <b>gauge</b> bosons (W', Z'), {{and a pair of}} neutral Higgs bosons (h, H). We demonstrate that for the lighter Higgs boson h of mass 125 GeV, this model predicts modified Higgs signal rates in h [...] > γγ, WW*, ZZ* channels via gluon fusions, in h [...] > tau tau mode via vector boson fusions, and in h [...] > bb mode via gauge boson associate productions. We perform a global fit for our theory by including both direct search data (LHC and Tevatron) and indirect precision constraints. We further analyze the LHC discovery potential for detecting the heavier Higgs state H. Comment: PLB published version. Only minor refinements, typos corrected, references adde...|$|R
