2500|$|The court's 2006 {{decision}} in Caballero v. Martinez concerned an illegal immigrant, Victor Manuel Caballero, who was injured during an accident while riding in an <b>uninsured</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{driven by an}} unlicensed person. The Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund, set up to cover injuries by uninsured drivers, refused to compensate him as he wasn't a legal resident. The Court on hearing his case overruled two lower courts and declared Caballero {{to be entitled to}} compensation from the fund, stating that [...] "a person may be a 'resident' even if the intent to remain ultimately is not realized". Previously an individual who had lived five months with relatives was not a resident with respect to the Fund.|$|E

50|$|This {{provides}} {{coverage for}} the insured aircraft against damage when {{it is on the}} ground and not in motion. This would provide protection for the aircraft for such events as fire, theft, vandalism, flood, mudslides, animal damage, wind or hailstorms, hangar collapse or for <b>uninsured</b> <b>vehicles</b> or aircraft striking the aircraft. The amount of coverage may be a blue book value or an agreed value that was set when the policy was purchased.|$|R
50|$|On 13 February 2013 Ward {{appeared}} before Ipswich Magistrates Court, Queensland, {{to plead guilty}} to driving under the influence of liquor or a drug, failing to stop for the police, driving without a licence and driving an unregistered and <b>uninsured</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Ward pleaded guilty and was fined £3275.68 and was disqualified from driving for two years. Ward subsequently issued a public apology.|$|E

50|$|In early 2003 Hilaly's {{vehicle was}} stopped because an object was {{protruding}} from it. After closer inspection, New South Wales Police {{charged him with}} driving an unregistered and <b>uninsured</b> <b>vehicle,</b> {{as well as for}} his behaviour towards the police officers. This incident led to an attack against police officers by nearby Muslims and widespread condemnation from the public. Although charges of assaulting the police officers, hindering the officers, and resisting arrest were later dropped due to police using invalid evidence to justify their suspicion and subsequent search, Hilaly was fined A$400 for the incident.|$|E

The goal is to find a season or period within a year where significantly different levels of accidents occures. Final model belongs to the category of dynamic regression, containing dummy variables, deterministic trend and ARMA component...|$|R
50|$|In 1997, Brown {{released}} a legislative plan that proposed a significant crackdown on driving while intoxicated and uninsured motorists since driver's licenses were first required in Louisiana in 1946. The legislature approved his bills {{to raise the}} driving age from 15 to 16, to limit the availability of uninsured motorists to recover losses from other drivers, the seize vehicles from multiple drunken-driving offenders, to lower the blood alcohol content for DWI, and to impound <b>uninsured</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
50|$|PACTS {{was founded}} in {{the debate about the}} {{compulsory}} wearing of seatbelts in the fronts of cars in 1981. Its current chair, Barry Sheerman MP, was instrumental in moving an amendment to the 1981 Transport Act to ensure that seatbelt wearing became a requirement. More recently, it helped to ensure that powers to use evidential roadside breath testing equipment were made available to the police and that the police were given the power to seize <b>uninsured</b> <b>vehicles</b> through the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005.|$|R

5000|$|The {{immediate}} impounding of {{an apparently}} <b>uninsured</b> <b>vehicle</b> replaces the former method {{of dealing with}} insurance spot-checks where drivers were issued with an HORT/1 (so-called because the order was form number 1 issued by the Home Office Road Traffic dept). This 'ticket' was an order requiring that within seven days, from midnight of the date of issue, the driver concerned was to take a valid insurance certificate (and usually other driving documents as well) to a police station of the driver's choice. Failure to produce an insurance certificate was, and still is, an offence. The HORT/1 was commonly known - even by the issuing authorities when dealing with the public - as a [...] "Producer". As these are seldom issued now and the MID relied upon to indicate the presence of insurance or not, {{it is incumbent upon}} the insurance industry to accurately and swiftly update the MID with current policy details and insurers that fail to do so can be penalised by their regulating body.|$|E
5000|$|Insurer, and Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) / licence data, {{are shared}} by the {{relevant}} authorities including the Police and this forms {{an integral part of}} the mechanism of CIE. All UK registered vehicles, including those that are exempt from VED (for example, Historic Vehicles and cars with low or zero emissions) are subject to the VED taxation application process. Part of this is a check on the vehicle's insurance. A physical receipt for the payment of VED was issued by way of a paper disc which, prior to 1 October 2014, meant that all motorists in the UK were required to prominently display the tax disc on their vehicle when it was kept or driven on public roads. This helped to ensure that most people had adequate insurance on their vehicles because insurance cover was required to purchase a disc, although the insurance must merely have been valid at the time of purchase and not necessarily for the life of the tax disc. [...] To address the problems that arise where a vehicle's insurance was subsequently cancelled but the tax disc remained in force and displayed on the vehicle and the vehicle then used without insurance, the CIE regulations are now able to be applied as the Driver & Vehicle Licence Authority (DVLA) and the MID databases are shared in real-time meaning that a taxed but <b>uninsured</b> <b>vehicle</b> is easily detectable by both authorities and Traffic Police. Post 1 October 2014 it is no longer a requirement to display a vehicle excise licence (tax disc) on a vehicle. This has come about because the whole VED process can now be administered electronically and alongside the MID, doing away with the expense, to the UK Government, of issuing paper discs.|$|E
40|$|Please check www. centspermilenow. org for {{the latest}} version (publication # 750) ] For decades state legislators have called for {{mandatory}} insurance laws, some legislators arguing their view that drivers of <b>uninsured</b> <b>vehicles</b> are high risk and a public safety problem. 1 In opposing such laws, however, insurers respond that drivers of uninsured cars closely resemble drivers of insured cars. 2 Despite opposition by insurers, to date 48 states have adopted mandatory insurance. Since many vehicles continue to be driven illegally without insurance, the character of drivers using <b>uninsured</b> <b>vehicles</b> continues to be studied and debated. Many of the studies involve how to assess the magnitude of uninsured driving. The discrepancies between methods were brought out in testimony in 1999 to the Texas legislature by a former Utah legislator. He spoke {{in support of a}} measure Utah adopted in 1995 to cross check insurance records monthly against vehicle registration records. This is how he described the situation before and after implementing the law. Mr. Kelly Atkinson: When I asked as a [state] representative what the uninsured motorists population was in the state of Utah, I was told by insurance companies that it was 3 %…. [T]he Commissioner of Public Safety told me it can’t be 5 % [sic] because at the time of accidents 9 % of people we checked that ge...|$|R
40|$|This {{submission}} {{has been}} prepared {{in response to}} the Parliamentary Travelsafe Committee’s Inquiry into Automatic Number Plate Recognition Technology. This submission will outline how automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) works, its history and application, as well as some key privacy and data management issues. After outlining evaluations that have been undertaken of ANPR and highlighting some limitations, the submission will examine the implications of the technology for road safety. The primary focus of this submission is on the potential of ANPR to both detect and deter a range of illegal road user behaviours including unlicensed driving, the driving of unregistered and <b>uninsured</b> <b>vehicles,</b> speeding, and the noncompliance of heavy vehicle drivers with driving hour regulations and novice drivers with provisional licence requirements. To this end, the submission will review different options for deploying ANPR, the risks associated with these different approaches, and how the likely road safety benefits of the technology could be maximised. To assist in this process, a set of principles is presented {{that can be used to}} assess the potential road safety benefits of ANPR technology...|$|R

50|$|All of {{the changes}} {{mentioned}} above have created a class of employees, who previously just handled one task or assignment, such as animal control, who are now engaged {{in a variety of}} quasi-police activities, especially enforcement roles that for lack of staffing are not handled by police officers. Although some work conducted by bylaw enforcement officers can be very minor in gravity, such as issuing tickets for expired meters, the investigation and enforcement duties conducted by bylaw officers are extremely important and necessary for the well-being of society. Dog attacks, for example, can be very serious events, where people or other animals can be gravely hurt. In most jurisdictions with bylaw officers, investigation work concerning dog attacks is conducted solely by the bylaw officers, without any police involvement. Such work can prevent future attacks, protect society from harm and/or cause an animal to be euthanized and its owners to face severe fines. Bylaw Enforcement Officers care for and protect animals, help mediate neighbourhood disputes, assure public safety by investigating illegal garbage/waste dumping and enforce regulations, the absence of which can severely impact a person's well-being, such as late-night noise from frequent parties that prevents a neighbourhood from sleeping. Bylaw enforcement officers are {{the first line of defense}} against a physical degradation of a neighbourhood or area, which can start with a broken window, lead to unsightly premises, and soon be littered with garbage, illegal signs, <b>uninsured</b> <b>vehicles</b> and lower real estate values. Bylaw enforcement is instrumental in preserving well-functioning neighbourhoods and fixing problematic ones.|$|R
40|$|For {{better or}} worse, {{we live in}} a society {{dominated}} by the automobile; Americans are notoriously dependent on automobiles for access to goods and services, for social and economic development, and for sustenance. In disaster situations, transportation can be critical to individual and household recovery efforts, particularly for those in areas with no public transportation or where public transportation has been disrupted. FEMA’s statutory mandate charges the agency with “alleviat[ing] the suffering and damage,” and unsurprisingly, this mandate encompasses disruptions to local transportation systems; the agency’s statutes and regulations authorize FEMA to provide financial aid for transportation needs, including repair or replacement of disaster–damaged personal vehicles. But to be eligible, FEMA requires proof of an applicant’s auto accident liability insurance—despite the fact that such insurance would not have covered the damaged vehicle. The only plausible policy reason given for this rule is that FEMA will not provide aid for vehicles not in compliance with state law. However, state mandatory insurance laws exist to reduce the numbers of uninsured motorists, a goal with little, if any, discernible relationship to FEMA’s mission of disaster relief. Moreover, most <b>uninsured</b> <b>vehicles</b> are owned by low-income households, and the postdisaster punitive effect on uninsured disaster survivors could violate FEMA’s antidiscrimination provisions, which include protections on the basis of economic status. What is more, auto insurance mandates are of dubious efficacy—raising more questions about the eligibility requirement. This Article examines and critiques the FEMA auto insurance mandate in light of the agency’s mission and history, and the mandate to alleviate disaster-related economic harms to low-income families. Further, this Article considers both the policy arguments and the potential for successful challenges to the policy through litigation or agency procedures...|$|R
50|$|Vehicle insurance, in the United States and elsewhere, is {{designed}} to cover risk of financial liability or {{the loss of a}} motor vehicle the owner may face if their vehicle is involved in a collision resulting in property or physical damages. Most states require a motor vehicle owner to carry some minimum level of liability insurance. States that do not require the vehicle owner to carry car insurance include Virginia, where an <b>uninsured</b> motor <b>vehicle</b> fee may be paid to the state; New Hampshire, and Mississippi which offers vehicle owners the option to post cash bonds (see below). The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution protects the rights of citizens in each respective state when traveling to another. A motor vehicle owner typically pays insurers a monthly fee, often called an insurance premium. The insurance premium a motor vehicle owner pays is usually determined by a variety of factors including the type of covered vehicle, the age and gender of any covered drivers, their driving history, and the location where the vehicle is primarily driven and stored. Credit scores are also taken into consideration. Most insurance companies offer premium discounts based on these factors.|$|R
