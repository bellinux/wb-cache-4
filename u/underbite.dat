5|$|P. sinensis {{is readily}} {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} species by numerous features of the skull. Adult skulls are smaller than those of P. mongoliensis and have less teeth. Uniquely, the premaxillary bone contacts the jugal (cheek) bone {{on the outside of}} the skull. The jugals flare out sideways, forming 'horns' proportionally wider than in any other known Psittacosaurus species except P. sibiricus and P. lujiatunensis. Because of the flared cheeks, the skull is actually wider than it is long. A smaller 'horn' is present behind the eye, at the contact of the jugal and postorbital bones, a feature also seen in P. sibiricus. The mandible (lower jaw) lacks the hollow opening, or fenestra, seen in other species, and the entire lower jaw is bowed outwards, giving the animal the appearance of an <b>underbite.</b> The skull of an adult P. sinensis can reach 11.5centimeters (4.5in) in length.|$|E
25|$|Many dog breeds have <b>underbite,</b> {{particularly}} those with short faces, like shih tzus and boxers. This may be due, {{as in the}} case of bulldogs, to a slower growing maxilla in relation to the mandible.|$|E
25|$|Unlike modern lizards, dinosaur teeth grew {{individually}} in the sockets of the jawbones, {{which are}} known as the alveoli. These differ from teeth of other vertebrates, which are directly fused to {{the bones of the}} jaw. Teeth that were lost were replaced by teeth below the roots in each tooth socket. Occlusion refers to the closing of the dinosaur's mouth, where the teeth from the upper and lower parts of the jaw meet. If the occlusion causes teeth from the maxillary or premaxillary bones to cover the teeth of the dentary and predentary, the dinosaur is said to have an overbite, the most common condition in this group. The opposite condition is considered to be an <b>underbite,</b> which is rare in theropod dinosaurs.|$|E
50|$|Incest, having sexual {{activity}} with a relative can cause major mutations in future progeny. This {{is shown by}} <b>underbites,</b> long lower jaws, Infertility, Cleft lip and cleft palate, clubfoot, having cognitive disabilities, Haemophilia, misshapen skulls, missing fingernails, and etc.|$|R
50|$|Dental braces (also {{known as}} braces, {{orthodontic}} cases, or cases) are devices used in orthodontics that align and straighten teeth and help position them {{with regard to}} a person's bite, while also aiming to improve dental health. They are often used to correct <b>underbites,</b> as well as malocclusions, overbites, open bites, deep bites, cross bites, crooked teeth, and various other flaws of the teeth and jaw. Braces can be either cosmetic or structural. Dental braces are often {{used in conjunction with}} other orthodontic appliances to help widen the palate or jaws and to otherwise assist in shaping the teeth and jaws.|$|R
5000|$|Successful {{treatments}} {{have shown}} that causes are functional rather than physical: that is, most lisps are caused by errors in tongue placement within the mouth rather than caused by any injury or congenital deformity to the mouth. The most frequently discussed of these problems is tongue thrust in which the tongue protrudes beyond the front teeth. This protrusion affects speech as well as swallowing {{and can lead to}} lisping. Ankyloglossia or tongue-tie can also be responsible for lisps in children. However it is unclear whether these deficiencies are caused by the tongue-tie itself or the muscle weakness following the correction of the tongue-tie. [...] Overbites and <b>underbites</b> may also contribute to non-lingual lisping. Temporary lisps can be caused by dental work, dental appliances such as dentures or retainers or by swollen or bruised tongues.|$|R
25|$|The Boxer is a medium-sized, {{short-haired}} {{breed of}} dog, developed in Germany. The coat {{is smooth and}} tight-fitting; colours are fawn or brindled, with or without white markings, and white. Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an <b>underbite),</b> very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The purpose of the crossbreeding was the wish to eliminate the excessive white color of the breed, {{and the necessity of}} producing thousands of dogs {{for one of the most}} popular breeds in the world. The Boxer is part of the Molosser group. This group is a category of solidly built, large dog breeds that all descend from the same common ancestor, the large shepherd dog known as a Molossus. The Boxer is a member of the Working Group.|$|E
2500|$|Pacu (...) is {{a common}} name {{used to refer to}} several species of {{omnivorous}} South American freshwater serrasalmid fish that are related to the piranha. Pacu and piranha do not have similar teeth, the main difference being jaw alignment; piranha have pointed, razor-sharp teeth in a pronounced <b>underbite,</b> whereas pacu have squarer, straighter teeth, which are uncannily similar to human teeth, and a less severe <b>underbite,</b> or a slight overbite. [...] Pacu, unlike piranha, mainly feed on plant material and not flesh or scales. Additionally, the pacu can reach much larger sizes than piranha, at up to [...] in total length and [...] in weight.|$|E

[...] The average adult Griffon stands from [...] tall, and weighs [...] [...] They have domed heads, short noses, and an <b>underbite.</b> [...] Their human-like facial features are often likened {{to that of}} an Ewok.|$|E
5000|$|A disproportionately grown upper {{or lower}} jaw causes dentofacial deformities. Chewing becomes problematic, {{and may also}} cause pain due to {{straining}} of the jaw muscle and bone. Deformities range from micrognathia, which is when the mandible doesn't grow far forward enough (over bite), and when the mandible grows too much, causing an under bite; {{all of which are}} uncomfortable. Also, a total maxilla osteotomy is used to treat the [...] "long face syndrome," [...] known as the skeptical open bite, idiopathic long face, hyper divergent face, total maxillary alveolar hyperplasia, and vertical maxillary excess. Prior to surgery, surgeons should take x-rays of the patient's jaw to determine the deformity, and to make a plan of procedures. Mandible osteotomies, or corrective jaw surgeries, benefit individuals who suffer from difficulty chewing, swallowing, TMJ pains, excessive wear of the teeth, open bites, overbites, <b>underbites,</b> or a receding chin. The deformities listed above can be perfected by an osteotomy surgery of either the maxilla or mandible (whichever the deformity calls for), which is performed by an oral surgeon who is specialized in the working with both the upper and lower jaws.Orthognathic surgery is also available as a very successful treatment (90-100%) for obstructive sleep apnea.|$|R
50|$|They are {{generally}} quite hardy, often living longer on average than some full-sized horse breeds; the average {{life span of}} miniature horses is from 25 to 35 years. However, {{there are also some}} health issues that are more frequently found in miniature horses than their full-sized relatives. Overfeeding is a common problem in miniature horses, leading to obesity; this is especially true when owners are used to owning full-sized horses. Dental issues, including crowding, brachygnathism (overbites) and prognathism (<b>underbites)</b> are frequently seen, due to having the same number of teeth in a much smaller mouth. They can also experience retention of deciduous teeth (baby teeth) and sinus problems from overcrowding. The combination of a propensity for overeating and dental problems can lead to an increased occurrence of colic. A major metabolic problem seen more frequently in miniature horses is hyperlipemia, where an appetite-reducing stressor can cause the body to break down significant amounts of fat, overwhelming the liver and potentially leading to liver failure. Reproduction is also more difficult in miniature horses, with a higher incidence of difficult births and a greater potential for eclampsia. The majority of the health problems seen more frequently in miniature horses are easily rectified with proper feeding and maintenance.|$|R
50|$|Tricho-Dento-Osseous Syndrome (TDO) meaning hair, teeth, {{and bones}} respectively, is a rare, systemic, genetic {{disorder}} that causes defects in these structures. This disease is present at birth. TDO {{has been shown}} to occur in areas of close geographic proximity and within families; most recent documented cases are Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. The cause of this disease is a mutation in the DLX3 (distal-less 3) gene, which controls hair follicle differentiation and induction of bone formation. One-hundred percent of patients with TDO suffer from two co-existing conditions called enamel hypoplasia and taurodontism in which the abnormal growth patterns of the teeth result in severe external and internal defects. The hair defects are characterized as being rough, course, with profuse shedding. Dental defects are characterized by dark-yellow/brownish colored teeth, thin and/or possibly pitted enamel, that is malformed. The teeth can also look normal in color, but also have a physical impression of extreme fragility and thinness in appearance. Additionally, severe <b>underbites</b> where the top and bottom teeth fail to correctly align may be present; it is common for the affected individual to have a larger, more pronounced lower jaw and longer bones. The physical deformities that TDO causes become more noticeable with age, and emotional support for the family as well as the affected individual is frequently recommended. Adequate treatment for TDO is a team based approach, mostly involving physical therapists, dentists, and oromaxillofacial surgeons. Genetic counseling is also recommended.|$|R
2500|$|Countering Bulldog breeders' {{claims that}} the breed's extreme traits, such as severe <b>underbite</b> and facial wrinkles, are for {{historical}} fighting purposes, historian David Hancock pointed out that [...] "the way in which breeders try to justify the short face, the excessive wrinkling and the physique it now depicts as being traditional is just simply untrue." [...] The programme stated that bulldog heads have become so large that the majority are unable to give birth naturally and puppies must be born by caesarian section.|$|E

She came to prominence when a photograph of her was posted on social news website Reddit by Bryan Bundesen, the brother of her owner Tabatha, in September 2012, and lolcats and parodies created from the photograph by Reddit users went viral. She {{is the subject of}} a popular internet meme in which negative lolcats (such as [...] "I Had Fun Once... It Was Awful") are made from photographs of her.|$|E
5000|$|The changes {{manifested}} by the tame foxes {{over the}} generations, moreover, {{were not only}} behavioral but also physiological, just as Belyayev had expected. The first physiological change detected in the tame foxes was a lower adrenaline level. Belyayev and his team [...] "theorized that adrenaline might share a biochemical pathway with melanin, which controls pigment production in fur", a hypothesis that has since been confirmed by research. As they became tamer, {{more and more of}} the foxes began showing [...] "signs of the domestication phenotype"; Trut later recalled that in the early 1980s [...] "we observed a kind of explosion-like change of the external appearance." [...] After eight to ten generations, the tame foxes began to develop particolored coats, a trait found more in domesticated animals than in wild ones; this was followed by the development of [...] "floppy ears and rolled tails similar to those in some breeds of dog". After 15 to 20 generations, a very small percentage of the tame foxes developed shorter tails and legs and <b>underbites</b> or overbites. The experimenters also discovered that the domesticated foxes show a [...] "fear response" [...] several weeks later than their wild counterparts, and that this delay is [...] "linked to changes in plasma levels of corticosteroids, hormones concerned with an animal's adaptation to stress". After 12 generations of selective breeding, the corticosteroid level in the tame foxes' plasma was [...] "slightly more than half the level in a control group". After 28 to 30 generations, [...] "the level had halved again." [...] At the same time, the tame foxes' brains contained higher levels of serotonin. Moreover, tame male foxes' skulls gradually became narrower, more like those of females, and litters became, [...] "on average, one pup larger".|$|R

2500|$|The head is {{the most}} {{distinctive}} feature of the Boxer. The breed standard dictates {{that it must be}} in perfect proportion to the body and above all it must never be too light. The greatest value is to be placed on the muzzle being of correct form and in absolute proportion to the skull. The length of the muzzle to the whole of the head should be a ratio of 1:3. Folds are always present from the root of the nose running downwards {{on both sides of the}} muzzle, and the tip of the nose should lie somewhat higher than the root of the muzzle. In addition a Boxer should be slightly prognathous, i.e., the lower jaw should protrude beyond the upper jaw and bend slightly upwards in what is commonly called an <b>underbite</b> or [...] "undershot bite".|$|E
