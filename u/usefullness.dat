The study replicates the previous on performed by Lin et. al (2004) in Taiwan. Population of the study were employees of end user computing at Bank Perkreditan Rakyat (BPR) in central Java, where as samples to be used were accounting department, credit department, teller dan manager. Data were collected using a mail survey were distributed as many as usable for 154 questionnaries. Data were analyzed by using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with the program Smart Partial Least Square (SmartPLS). The findings show that of internal organization factors only management support (MS) has a positive and significant influence to perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived <b>usefullness</b> (PU), Internal computer support (ICS) and internal computer training (ICT) not influence to perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived <b>usefullness</b> (PU). The external organizational factor only external computer support (ECS) has a positive and significant influence to perceived ease of use (PEOU) but not significant of perceived <b>usefullness</b> (PU), external computer support (ECS) and external computer training (ICT) not influence of perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived <b>usefullness</b> (PU).
