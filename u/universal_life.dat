40|$|In {{this paper}} we use an intensity-based {{framework}} {{to analyze and}} compute the correlated default probabilities, both in finance and actuarial sciences, following the idea of "change of measure" initiated by Collin-Dufresne et al. (2004). Our method {{is based on a}} representation theorem for joint survival probability among an arbitrary number of defaults, which works particularly effectively for certain types of correlated default models, including the counter-party risk models of Jarrow and Yu (2001) and related problems such as the phenomenon of "flight to quality". The results are also useful in studying the recently observed dependent mortality for married couples involving spousal bereavement. In particular we study in details a problem of pricing <b>Universal</b> Variable <b>Life</b> (UVL) insurance products. The explicit formulae for the joint-life status and last-survivor status (or equivalently, the probability distribution of first-to-default and last-to-default in a multi-firm setting) enable us to derive the explicit solution to the indifference pricing formula without using any advanced results in partial differential equations.

Gaga urged her fans via YouTube to contact their senators in an effort to overturn the policy. In September 2010, she spoke at a Servicemembers Legal Defense Network's rally in Portland, Maine. Following this event, The Advocate named her a [...] "fierce advocate" [...] for gays and lesbians. Gaga appeared at Europride, an international event dedicated to LGBT pride, in Rome in June 2011. She criticized the poor state of gay rights in many European countries and described gay people as [...] "revolutionaries of love". Gaga was ordained as a minister by the <b>Universal</b> <b>Life</b> Church Monastery so that she could officiate the wedding of two female friends. In June 2016, during a vigil held in Los Angeles for victims of the attack at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando, Gaga read aloud the names of the 49 people killed in the attack, and gave a speech. Later that month, Gaga appeared in Human Rights Campaign's tribute video to the victims of the attack. She has opposed the presidency of Donald Trump and criticized him for his military transgender ban. She publicly supported former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for president in 2016.|$|E

6000|$|It is not {{a pretty}} book, {{but it is a}} masterful {{interrogation}} of life--not of <b>life</b> <b>universal,</b> but of <b>life</b> particular, the social life of to-day.

So fearful is its portrayal of social disease, so ruthless its stripping of the painted charms from vice, that its tendency cannot but be strongly for good. It is a goad, to prick sleeping human consciences awake and drive them into the battle for humanity.|$|R
