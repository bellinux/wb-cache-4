5|$|A compact cyclone, Fred quickly {{reached its}} peak {{strength}} as a hurricane, with a minimum central pressure of 986mbar (hPa; 29.12inHg) and 85mph (140km/h) winds. Through the rest of August31, the hurricane traversed the Barlavento Islands of Cape Verde, barely skirting the southern coast of Boa Vista around 12:00UC. Gradually decreasing in definition, the eye passed north of São Nicolau and then north-northeast of Santo Antão over the next 12hours. On September1, drier air and stronger wind shear aloft dispersed the convection around the cyclone's core, causing Fred to diminish to a tropical storm. The weakened storm turned slightly toward the west-northwest, over considerably cooler waters, in response to high pressure rebuilding to its north. Through much of September14, Fred produced limited convective activity, with intermittent flares of thunderstorms that were continuously blown away from the center by the strong <b>upper</b> <b>winds.</b> Despite the adverse environment and the storm's lack of stable convection, Fred maintained a robust spiral of low-level clouds and gales during this period, defying the NHC's repeated forecasts of its dissipation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{tropical}} cyclones in {{the extreme}} eastern Atlantic are typically propelled westward by high pressures from a subtropical ridge, this depression took an atypical northwestward path along a breach in the ridge from a previous disturbance. Its cyclonic structure steadily improved as a sharply curved rainband, resembling the precursor to an eye, tightened around the center. At 06:00UTC on August30, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fred 390mi (625km) east-southeast of Praia, Cape Verdeamong the four easternmost locations for a tropical storm to form since modern record-keeping began in 1851. A steady trend of intensification ensued while Fred moved through a region with ample tropical moisture, light <b>upper</b> <b>winds,</b> and above-average sea surface temperatures. The storm developed a thick, circular central dense overcast with good outflow, and the eye feature became well established {{at all levels of}} the circulation. Based on these characteristics, as well as satellite intensity estimates of 75mph (120km/h) winds, Fred was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane at 00:00UTC, August31. Then centered 165mi (270km) east-southeast of Sal, Cape Verde, it became the easternmost tropical cyclone ever to attain hurricane status in the tropical Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|Early on July 20, {{the heavily}} sheared cyclone began to reaccelerate within the {{deepening}} southwesterly wind flow. Over the next day, Bret continued to deteriorate in organization; however, a brief {{decline in the}} <b>upper</b> <b>winds</b> allowed intermittent bursts of convection to redevelop south of the exposed center. Bret eventually weakened to a tropical depression over cool ocean temperatures early on July 22, once again lacking significant convection while increasing in forward speed. Forecasters at the NHC noted that Bret remained [...] "a maverick tropical cyclone by refusing to dissipate despite experiencing very hostile wind shear conditions," [...] with ship data indications of prevailing strong winds. By 1500 UTC, however, the circulation had become ill defined, prompting the NHC to declassify Bret as a tropical system about 375mi (605km) north of Bermuda. During the next several hours, the remnant low of Bret continued to move northeastward out into the Atlantic, until it dissipated on June 23.|$|E

In this paper a balloon-tracing and wind measuring method bases on inertial navigation systems (INS) is proposed accounting to the limitation in conventional methods. In this paper, INS measurement for <b>upper</b> <b>wind</b> system is established, its mathematical model is built, and the errors are analyzed. The results indicated that the average relative errors of wind velocity ranges from 2 % to 4 % and average wind direction measurement ranges from 7 degrees to 14 degrees; The maximum relative errors of wind velocity measurement ranges from 8 % to 11 %, the maximum errors of wind direction measurement ranges from 12 degrees to 17 degrees.

The launch was {{originally}} scheduled for 18 February, but was postponed {{to allow for}} the replacement of faulty liquid oxygen turbopumps on the three main engines. The amended target date of 11 March also proved unviable because of the failure of a master event controller when it was powered up during prelaunch checkout; the controller was quickly replaced.

Eventually the <b>upper</b> <b>winds</b> start playing a religious-sounding melody, and the soloist plays very lightly in the background, the sound of a motorcycle. Though it is the sound of a distant machine, the tones harmonize with the procession music. Eventually the soloist plays a countermelody against the processional music. The movement ends with the soloist playing a very high and loud note until his air is gone. Then he sucks in with a deathly sound and begins the next movement.|$|E

We obtained three-dimensional details of radar echo distribution within a radius of 50 km and up to 15 km in height every 10 minutes. Our observations in June 1996 detected three cases of the line-shaped stationary radar echoes extending from the Nagasaki Peninsula area to the direction of Isahaya Bay. The appearance {{of this kind of}} line echo is fairly common. These particular echoes suggest that there is a topographical effect of rain-cloud formation, because these line-shaped echoes appear only under some common limited conditions, which are : (a) A considerably strong, humid surface wind from the S to SSW. (b) Individual cellular echoes within the linear echoes move in a velocity coinciding with the <b>upper</b> <b>wind,</b> so that, every component is replaced continuously.
