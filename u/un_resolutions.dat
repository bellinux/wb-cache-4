5|$|The {{day after}} the invasion, Portugal cut {{diplomatic}} ties with Indonesia {{and went on to}} support <b>UN</b> <b>resolutions</b> condemning the invasion. However, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Portuguese government appeared reluctant to push the issue; American Indonesia specialist, Benedict Anderson suggests this stemmed from uncertainty at the time over its application to the European Community. Portugal's criticism mounted sharply from the mid-1980s, and due to public pressure, the country became one of the highest profile campaigners in international forums for East Timorese self-determination. Throughout the 1990s, Portugal took part in UN-brokered mediations with Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The Security Council {{is made up}} {{of fifteen}} member states, {{consisting}} of five permanent members—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms by the General Assembly (with end of term date)—Bolivia (term ends 2018), Egypt (2017), Ethiopia (2018), Italy (2018), Japan (2017), Kazakhstan (2018), Senegal (2017), Sweden (2018), Ukraine (2017), Uruguay (2017). The five permanent members hold veto power over <b>UN</b> <b>resolutions,</b> allowing a permanent member to block adoption of a resolution, though not debate. The ten temporary seats are held for two-year terms, with five member states per year voted in by the General Assembly on a regional basis. The presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically each month.|$|E

5|$|The former-Portuguese {{colony of}} East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975, however, {{following}} years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President B.J. Habibie subsequently {{agreed to allow}} the East Timorese to vote on autonomy in 1999. The United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) was established to organise and conduct the vote, which {{was held at the}} end of August 1999 and resulted with 78.5% of voters deciding in favour of independence. However, following the announcement of the results pro-Indonesian militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military, launched a campaign of violence, looting and arson and many East Timorese were killed, while perhaps more than 500,000 were displaced. Unable to control the violence, Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force. Australia, which had contributed police to UNAMET, organised and led an international military coalition, known as the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET), a non-UN force operating in accordance with <b>UN</b> <b>resolutions.</b> The total size of the Australian force committed numbered 5,500 personnel, and included a significant ground force, supported by air and naval forces, in the largest single deployment of Australian forces since 1945.|$|E

25|$|The thaw in {{diplomatic}} relations {{came to an}} abrupt end. In May 2010, the USA renewed sanctions against Syria, saying that it supported terrorist groups, seeks {{weapons of mass destruction and}} has provided Lebanon's Hezbollah with Scud missiles in violation of <b>UN</b> <b>resolutions.</b> In 2011 the UN's IAEA nuclear watchdog reported Syria to the UN Security Council over its alleged covert nuclear programme.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the United States {{government}} began {{to argue for}} the necessity of invading Iraq. This formally began with a speech by U.S President George W.

25|$|A.G. Noorani {{also writes}} that the {{accession}} of Kashmir to India was strictly conditional. He says that Kashmiri rights for self-determination are not derived from the <b>UN</b> <b>Resolutions</b> but their right is actually engrafted as a condition on the Instrument of Accession. He writes that state elections do not fulfill this condition since Mountbatten mentioned {{a reference to the}} people of the state and not 'elections to the Assembly'.|$|E
25|$|The legal {{situation}} concerning Gibraltar was settled in 1713 by the Treaty of Utrecht, in which Spain ceded the territory in perpetuity to the British Crown stating that, should the British abandon this post, {{it would be}} offered to Spain first. Since the 1940s Spain has called {{for the return of}} Gibraltar. The overwhelming majority of Gibraltarians strongly oppose this, along with any proposal of shared sovereignty. <b>UN</b> <b>resolutions</b> call on the United Kingdom and Spain, both EU members, to reach an agreement over the status of Gibraltar.|$|E

25|$|Turkey, only 75km away, had {{repeatedly}} claimed, for decades {{before the invasion}} and frequently afterwards, that Cyprus was of vital strategic importance to it. Ankara has defied a host of <b>UN</b> <b>resolutions</b> demanding the withdrawal of its occupation troops from the island. About 142,000 Greek Cypriots living in the north – nearly {{one quarter of the}} population of Cyprus – were forcibly expelled from the occupied northern part of the island where they constituted 80% of the population. These people are still deprived of the right {{to return to their homes}} and properties. U.S. Congress imposed an embargo on arms sales to Turkey leading to excessive tension and mistrust between Turkey and the United States.|$|E
25|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, the US delegate, Adlai Stevenson, {{strongly}} criticised India's {{use of force}} to resolve her dispute with Portugal, stressing that such resort to violent means was against the charter of the UN. He stated that condoning such acts of armed forces would encourage other nations to resort to similar solutions to their own disputes, and would lead to the death of the United Nations. In response, the Soviet delegate, Valerian Zorin, argued that the Goan question was wholly within India's domestic jurisdiction and could not be considered by the Security Council. He also drew attention to Portugal's disregard for <b>UN</b> <b>resolutions</b> calling for the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples.|$|E
25|$|Akram {{claims that}} after 1969, the UN General Assembly, partly in {{response}} to new Arab and PLO priorities, shifted its perspective to acknowledge the Palestinians as a people having rights under the UN charter (see, for example, the first paragraph of UNGA , UN GAOR, 24th Sess., Supp. No. 30 at 25, UN Doc. A/8730 (1970). The author considers that recognition of the Palestinians' juridical status has been affirmed by all subsequent <b>UN</b> <b>resolutions</b> on the subject (see, for example, , UN GAOR, 25th Sess., Supp. No. 28 at 36, UN Doc.
