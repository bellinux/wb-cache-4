25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New Hampshire hills, {{but it will not}} succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

50|$|The railway {{was built}} {{so that the}} trains would not have any steep {{inclines}} or sharp turns. It is these characteristics which make it suitable as a cycle trail.

40|$|The {{quadratic}} assignment problem (QAP) or maximum acyclical graph {{problem is}} well documented (see e. g. Pardalos and Wolkowicz, 1994).

50|$|The Chapwurrung {{people lived}} in this region {{to the south and}} east of the Grampians for over 4,000 years prior to the arrival of the Europeans. The first pastoralists took <b>up</b> {{properties}} <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1830s, and there was a decade of sometimes violent clashes with the Chapwurring. A small European township developed which was initially known as Mount Sturgeon, the hill behind the town. A Post Office of that name opened on 1 July 1852 (Dunkeld from 1 January 1854); but, as the early settlers were predominantly Scottish, it was renamed Dunkeld after a Scottish town which was the principal locality of <b>the</b> Caledonian picts <b>in</b> Roman times.|$|R
