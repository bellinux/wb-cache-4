5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} in {{the emergency}} setting can be difficult with the fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood, vomit, or secretions in the airway and poor patient cooperation. Because of this, patients with massive facial injury, complete <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> obstruction, severely diminished ventilation, or profuse <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> bleeding are poor candidates for fiberoptic intubation. Fiberoptic intubation under general anesthesia typically requires two skilled individuals. Success rates of only 83–87% have been reported using fiberoptic techniques {{in the emergency}} department, with significant nasal bleeding occurring in up to 22% of patients. These drawbacks limit the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy somewhat in urgent and emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|Croup is {{typically}} diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. The {{first step is}} to exclude other obstructive conditions of the <b>upper</b> <b>airway,</b> especially epiglottitis, an airway foreign body, subglottic stenosis, angioedema, retropharyngeal abscess, and bacterial tracheitis.|$|E
5|$|Minor {{complications}} {{are common}} after laryngoscopy and insertion of an orotracheal tube. These are typically of short duration, such as sore throat, lacerations of the lips or gums or other structures within the <b>upper</b> <b>airway,</b> chipped, fractured or dislodged teeth, and nasal injury. Other complications which are common but potentially more serious include accelerated or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, elevated intracranial and introcular pressure, and bronchospasm.|$|E

Davies ABSTRACT: We measured <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> resistance from the trachea and from the pharynx to the atmosphere, EMG of the genioglossus muscle {{and the sound of}} snoring, In anaesthetized greyhounds, breathing spontane· ously through the <b>upper</b> <b>airways.</b> Using extra-corporeally produced con-tinuous flow we determined flow/pressure curves for the <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> and resistances from the trachea and from the pharynx. We tested the effects of 0. 9 % saUne and of Sonarex (a proprietary mixture containing sodium chloride, glycerol, polysorbate 80 and benzalkonium chloride). Both saline and Sonarex decreased <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> resistance, but the latter did so more consistently. With Sonarex, genioglossus activity Increased and the sound of snoring decreased. Flow/pressure curves 5 - 20 min after Sonarex showed a decrease in <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> resistance and a smoother curve, whereas those with saline showed an increase in resistance. The sound produced by continuous flow through the <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> was decreased by Sonarex but Increased by saline. Thus, both Sonarex and saline decrease <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> resistance, but Sonarex also reduces the sound of snoring and the resistance and sound of continuous airflow through the <b>upper</b> <b>airways...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{postoperative}} cognitive decline {{resulting from}} volatile anesthesia is gaining acceptance {{as a major}} health problem. The common anesthetic isoflurane is suspected to precipitate neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease by unknown mechanisms. We previously validated that 8 month old Tau. P 301 L mice suffer <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> defects related to tauopathy within the Kolliker-Fuse nucleus that controls <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> function. We now report that isoflurane anesthesia in young, pre-symptomatic Tau. P 301 L mice triggered precocious <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> defects and tauopathy in several brainstem nuclei, including the nucleus ambiguus that contains <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> motor neurons and the Kolliker-Fuse. The prescription drug memantine, identified as an NMDA receptor antagonist, prevented the post-anesthesia <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> dysfunction and alleviated tauopathy in the nucleus ambiguus and Kolliker-Fuse. We further identified protocols of anesthesia in young Tau. P 301 L mice that mitigated adverse effects of isoflurane anesthesia. Thus, our experimental findings in a validated mouse model for tauopathy demonstrate the link between isoflurane anesthesia, earlier onset of tauopathy and earlier onset of functional deficits, highlight the implication of NMDA-receptors in the mechanisms mediating the adverse effects of isoflurane, and potentially identify safer protocols for anesthesia in patients with tauopathy.

40|$|Introduction and Objective. Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) is {{characterized}} by at least 5 ten-second-long episodes of apnea or hypopnea, per hour of sleep. This disease may lead to severe, life-threatening complications. Therefore, risk analysis and its influence on disease intensity is crucial for proper implementation of preventive treatments. Objective. To determine {{the relation between the}} intensity of OSA expressed in Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), and the anterior-posterior diameter of <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> at the levels of soft palate and tongue base. Material and Method. Medical records of 41 patients with sleep apnea (AHI> 4) diagnosed through polysomnographic examination obstructive were used for the study. The data consisted of: age and gender, polysomnographic examination results (AHI), lateral cephalogram with cephalomertic analysis, together with measurements of the upper and lower pharyngeal depth according to McNamara. Statistical analysis was carried out in accordance with Pearson’s r correlation coefficient test (Statistica 8. 0 software package). Results. Analysis of the influence of <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> diameter on the intensity of OSA showed that the value of <b>upper</b> <b>Airways</b> diameter at the tongue base level had no statistically significant impact on the value of AHI (p= 0. 795). However, a statistically significant impact of the value of <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> diameter on the AHI value (p= 0. 008) at the soft palate level was observed. Patients with OSA have narrowed <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> diameter. The value of AHI increases with the decrease of upper diameter and is not dependent on a lower diameter value. Patients with a decreased <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> diameter should be informed about potential breathing disorders during sleep...|$|R
5|$|An intubating stylet is a {{malleable}} metal wire {{designed to be}} inserted into the endotracheal tube to make the tube conform better to the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> anatomy of the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets, such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} can {{be associated}} with minor complications such as broken teeth or lacerations of the tissues of the <b>upper</b> <b>airway.</b> It can also {{be associated with}} potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents which can result in a severe and sometimes fatal chemical aspiration pneumonitis, or unrecognized intubation of the esophagus which can lead to potentially fatal anoxia. Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal intubation. Alternative strategies for securing the airway must always be readily available.|$|E
5|$|When {{taking the}} patient's medical history, {{the subject is}} {{questioned}} about any significant signs or symptoms, such as difficulty in speaking or difficulty in breathing. These may suggest obstructing lesions in various locations within the <b>upper</b> <b>airway,</b> larynx, or tracheobronchial tree. A history of previous surgery (e.g., previous cervical fusion), injury, radiation therapy, or tumors involving the head, neck and upper chest can also provide clues to a potentially difficult intubation. Previous experiences with tracheal intubation, especially difficult intubation, intubation for prolonged duration (e.g., intensive care unit) or prior tracheotomy are also noted.|$|E

40|$|An {{indication}} of obstruction to the <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> (trachea and larynx) {{may be obtained}} by calculating {{the ratio of the}} forced expired volume in one second to the peak expiratory flow rate (FEV 1 /PEFR). This index was found to be usually less than 10 in normal subjects (mean 7 · 3), and in patients with asthma (mean 6 · 9), chronic bronchitis (mean 7 · 7), or interstitial lung disease (mean 6 · 3). A study of simulated <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> obstruction showed that this index rises as the obstruction becomes more severe. All of 18 patients with proved <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> obstruction had FEV 1 /PEFR indices greater than 10 (mean 14 · 0). This test can be carried out with forced expiratory manoeuvres only, and it does not require the use of complicated equipment. An FEV 1 /PEFR ratio greater than 10, when <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> obstruction is suspected, indicates that significant obstruction may be present. High values suggest that the obstruction may be severe, and that further investigations are indicated...|$|R

5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{vary depending on}} {{what part of the}} tracheobronchial tree is injured and how severely it is damaged. There are no direct signs of TBI, but certain signs suggest the injury and raise a clinician's suspicion that it has occurred. Many of the signs {{and symptoms}} are also present in injuries with similar injury mechanisms such as pneumothorax. Dyspnea and respiratory distress are found in 76–100% of people with TBI, and coughing up blood has been found in up to 25%. However, isolated TBI does not usually cause profuse bleeding; if such bleeding is observed {{it is likely to be}} due to another injury such as a ruptured large blood vessel. The patient may exhibit dysphonia or have diminished breath sounds, and rapid breathing is common. Coughing may be present, and stridor, an abnormal, high-pitched breath sound indicating obstruction of the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> can also occur.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{may reach}} the lung {{by a number}} of {{different}} routes. Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then they touch their eyes or nose. Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the mouth or nose. Once in the <b>upper</b> <b>airway,</b> the viruses may make their way in the lungs, where they invade the cells lining the airways, alveoli, or lung parenchyma. Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood. The invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death. When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur. Primarily white blood cells, mainly mononuclear cells, generate the inflammation. As well as damaging the lungs, many viruses simultaneously affect other organs and thus disrupt other body functions. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can arise as a co-morbid condition.|$|E

Statistical analysis was carried out in accordance with Pearson’s correlation coefficient test. Our work demonstrated a negative correlation between BMI and the diameter of the <b>upper</b> <b>airways,</b> and a positive correlation between BMI and AHI value.

25|$|OSA {{also appears}} to have a genetic component; those with a family history of it are more likely to develop it themselves. Lifestyle factors such as smoking may also {{increase}} the chances of developing OSA as the chemical irritants in smoke tend to inflame the soft tissue of the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> and promote fluid retention, both of which can result in narrowing of the <b>upper</b> <b>airway.</b> An individual may also experience or exacerbate OSA with the consumption of alcohol, sedatives, or any other medication that increases sleepiness as most of these drugs are also muscle relaxants.|$|E
