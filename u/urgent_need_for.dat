However, the urgency of the requirement resulted in the approval by the Adjutant General and the construction of a prototype was authorized by OCM 17391, dated 31 October 1941; the new vehicle designated as the 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage T19.|$|E
5|$|Harmless and docile, the thornback {{guitarfish}} can {{be readily}} approached underwater, and fares well in public aquariums. Off the United States, this ray is common and faces no substantial threats: it is only occasionally caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers, and has no economic value. As most of its range lies within US waters, the species has been assessed as Least Concern overall by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, in Mexican waters the thornback guitarfish population is small and fragmented, {{and the degree to}} which it is affected by fishing is uncertain. There, the IUCN has listed it locally under Data Deficient while noting its susceptibility to inshore lagoon fisheries and shrimp trawlers, and the <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> additional information to ensure its long-term regional survival.|$|E

The King expressed an <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> Honolulu to upgrade its street lighting, which at that time was provided by kerosene lamps. Edison demonstrated some electric light bulbs, and Kalākaua showed interest in the technical details.

5|$|The {{design was}} adopted by an Act of Parliament in 1813, which {{permitted}} the commissioners to borrow £600,000 for building and construction. The street was intended to have commercial purposes and {{it was expected that}} a majority of the income would come from private capital. Nash took responsibility for design and valuation of all properties. Construction of the road resulted in demolishing numerous properties, disrupting trade and polluting the air with dust. Existing tenants had first offer to purchase leases on the new properties. The Treasury supported the proposal because, in the aftermath of the lengthy Napoleonic Wars, there was an <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the government to create jobs. Government expenditure was low because the design relied heavily upon private developers, such as Nash himself. The buildings were to be let on 99-year leases, as was common at the time, and income could be recouped in the form of ground rent.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the smalltail shark {{is caught}} {{incidentally}} by gillnet and longline fisheries throughout its range. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted. In addition, the dried fins are exported {{for use in}} shark fin soup, the liver oil and cartilage are used medicinally, and the carcass is processed into fishmeal. In 2006, the IUCN assessed this species, including Pacific populations now separated as C. cerdale, as Data Deficient {{due to a lack}} of fishery data. In Trinidad, its abundance makes it the most economically important shark. Off northern Brazil, substantial numbers are caught by gillnet fisheries targeting the Serra Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus brasiliensis). In the 1980s, this species constituted roughly 43% of the shark and ray catch, but has since declined to around 17%. This apparent decline is thought to have resulted from increasing fishing effort, the large proportion of juveniles captured, and the shark's low reproductive rate. Consequently, the IUCN has assessed the smalltail shark in Brazil as Vulnerable, and noted the <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> conservation measures given that northern Brazil represents the center of the species' range. Although the smalltail shark was ostensibly given protection by inclusion on the 2004 Official List of Endangered Animals in Brazil, fishing remains effectively unmanaged.|$|E
