The price will substantially reflect (1) {{the value of}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>shares,</b> (2) the discounted gross income advantage of the convertible over the <b>underlying</b> <b>shares,</b> plus (3) some figure for the embedded optionality of the bond.

25|$|Each ADR {{is issued}} by a {{domestic}} custodian bank when the <b>underlying</b> <b>shares</b> are deposited {{in a foreign}} depositary bank, usually by a broker who has purchased the shares in the open market local to the foreign company. An ADR can represent {{a fraction of a}} share, a single share, or multiple shares of a foreign security. The holder of a DR has the right to obtain the underlying foreign security that the DR represents, but investors usually find it more convenient to own the DR. The price of a DR generally tracks the price of the foreign security in its home market, adjusted for the ratio of DRs to foreign company shares. In the case of companies domiciled in the United Kingdom, creation of ADRs attracts a 1.5% creation fee; this creation fee is different than stamp duty reserve tax charge by the UK government. Depositary banks have various responsibilities to DR holders and to the issuing foreign company the DR represents.|$|E
2500|$|This volatility/credit {{dichotomy}} is {{the standard}} practice for valuing convertibles. [...] What makes convertibles so interesting is that, except {{in the case of}} exchangeables (see above), one cannot entirely separate the volatility from the credit. [...] Higher volatility (a good thing) tends to accompany weaker credit (bad). In the case of exchangeables, the credit quality of the issuer may be decoupled from the volatility of the <b>underlying</b> <b>shares.</b> [...] The true artists of convertibles and exchangeables are the people who know how to play this balancing act.|$|E

We describe the implementation of a file system and an <b>underlying</b> <b>shared</b> logical disk, designed to run on workstation networks and on the SHRIMP multicomputer. The file system level is very similar to a conventional uniprocessor file system, relying on the <b>underlying</b> <b>shared</b> logical disk to handle all communication, caching, and coherence operations.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a valuation {{model for a}} perpetual convertible bond when the price dynamics of the <b>underlying</b> <b>share</b> are governed by continuous-time Markovian regime-switching models. We suppose that the appreciation rate and the volatility of the <b>underlying</b> <b>share</b> are modulated by a continuous-time, finite-state, observable Markov chain. The states of this chain are interpreted as the states of an economy. Here the valuation problem of the perpetual convertible bond {{can be viewed as}} that of valuing a perpetual stock loan, or a perpetual American option with time-dependent strike price. With the presence of the regime-switching effect, the market in the model is, in general, incomplete. To provide a convenient method to determine a price kernel for valuation, we employ the regime-switching Esscher transform introduced in Elliott, Chan and Siu (2005) [4]. We then adopt the differential equation approach in Guo and Zhang (2004) [7] to solve the optimal stopping problem associated with the valuation of the perpetual convertible bond. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the practical implementation of the proposed model. © 2009 Academic Publications. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Long-run {{convergence}} {{evidenced by}} cointegration {{suggests that if}} price movement of ADR and the <b>underlying</b> <b>share</b> diverges, market forces will act to eliminate the gap. The dynamics of the ADR portfolios can well {{be influenced by the}} deviation from the long-run relationship, or specifically, the error terms in the cointegration equation. Therefore, we examine the long run relationship of stock price between ADRs and their respective underlying securities particularly in emerging markets, especially those countries experience the financial crisis in this decade. We employ the EC terms as proxies for the amount of information generated by individual equity markets and add dummy variables to capture the effect of financial crisis and exchange rate volatility to the long-run equilibrium relationship between ADRs market and underlying stocks market. Resolving the value discrepancies by adjustment in prices of foreign equities become stronger during the financial crisis period, however, become weaker by adjustment in prices of ADRs. The results also demonstrate that high exchange rate volatility will improve the market forces to eliminate the gap of same-day price movement of ADR and the <b>underlying</b> <b>share</b> diverges by adjustment in prices of foreign equities. On the contrary, low exchange rate volatility will improve the market forces to eliminate the gap of one-day lag price movement of ADR and the <b>underlying</b> <b>share</b> diverges by adjustment in prices of ADRs. 1.
