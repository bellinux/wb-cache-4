60|$|Aaron, however, had {{reckoned}} {{without his}} host. Sir William sat <b>upright</b> in his <b>chair,</b> <b>with</b> all {{the determination of}} a frail old man who insists on being level with the young. The new guest sat in a lower chair, smoking, that curious glimmer on his face which made him so attractive, and which only meant {{that he was looking}} on the whole scene from the outside, as it were, from beyond a fence. Sir William came almost directly to the attack.|$|R
60|$|Plunging {{now into}} a group {{dominated}} for the moment by an angular woman who was saying loud and penetrating things about the suffrage, Mrs. Pett had seized and removed a tall, blonde {{young man with a}} mild, vacuous face. For the past few minutes this young man had been sitting bolt <b>upright</b> on a <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> his hands on his knees, so exactly in the manner of an end-man at a minstrel show that one would hardly have been surprised had he burst into song or asked a conundrum.|$|R
30|$|Spirometric {{measurements}} {{taken when}} standing {{were compared to}} four sitting positions (Figure  1). These were; a) sitting in an <b>upright</b> <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> a horizontal seat, {{feet on the floor}} and with the trunk at 90 ° to the thighs [here referred to as “sit flat”], b) sitting with the trunk vertical on a seat that sloped downwards so that the angle between the trunk and thighs was 115 ° [“slope down”], c) sitting on a horizontal seat with the back reclining so that the angle between the thighs and the trunk was 122 ° [“slope back”] and d) sitting with trunk vertical and the thighs sloping upwards to make an angle of 65 ° with the trunk [“slope up”]. Ergonomic <b>chairs</b> <b>with</b> kneeling or saddle designs require a trunk to thigh angle of 110 °– 125 ° (Bettany-Saltikov et al. 2008; Gandavadi and Ramsay 2005). These have a pommel or knee support to prevent the sitter slipping off. We chose 115 ° for “sit slope” as the steepest angle that could comfortably be maintained without slipping. Positions c) and d) were extreme positions in which the biomechanics of breathing should be considerably altered. The liver (weight around 1.5  kg in the adult male) is attached to the underside of the diaphragm and gravity contributes to its descent during inhalation. In more supine positions such as “slope back”, this effect is reduced (Hoit 1995). The angle used is also said to minimise intervertebral disk pressure and postural muscle activity (Harrison et al. 1999). Reducing the angle between the trunk and thighs to 65 ° (“slope up”) would be expected to restrict anterior abdominal wall expansion and restrict the descent of the diaphragm. The subjects were 30 undergraduate students (13 males, 17 females of Caucasian origin) from the Royal Welsh College of Music (RWCMD) and Drama and Cardiff University, age 20.7 [*]±[*] 1.0  yrs (mean[*]±[*]s.d.), mean BMI 23.3 [*]±[*] 3.6. Ten were music (brass) students and 20 were science and humanities students but as {{there was no significant difference}} between the spirometric data from two groups, this was pooled.|$|R
50|$|When {{measuring}} {{blood pressure}} in the home, an accurate reading requires that one not drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, or engage in strenuous exercise for 30 minutes before taking the reading. A full bladder may have a small effect on blood pressure readings; if the urge to urinate arises, one should do so before the reading. For 5 minutes before the reading, one should sit <b>upright</b> in a <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> one's {{feet flat on the}} floor and with limbs uncrossed. The blood pressure cuff should always be against bare skin, as readings taken over a shirt sleeve are less accurate. The same arm should be used for all measurements. During the reading, the arm that is used should be relaxed and kept at heart level, for example by resting it on a table.|$|R

6000|$|I {{have said}} [...] "by one night's work," [...] but, in truth, {{it was by}} two nights' work, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up with Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly {{three o'clock in the}} morning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs. It was a most melancholy vigil, and ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs. Fortunately we were not discouraged, and we {{determined}} to try again. The next night we lowered the lamp, and sat smoking cigarettes without making the least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by, and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into which he hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and we had almost for the second time given it up in despair, when in an instant we both sat bolt <b>upright</b> in our <b>chairs,</b> <b>with</b> all our weary senses keenly on the alert once more. We had heard the creak of a step in the passage.|$|R
60|$|She had a {{funny way}} at times of holding her head on one side like an Aberdeen puppy. She was sitting in an <b>upright</b> <b>chair,</b> sewing, for she {{had no time to}} do nothing, and Philip had made himself {{comfortable}} at her feet.|$|R

60|$|After this ghastly toast {{nothing more}} was spoken by {{anyone at the}} table. In oppressive silence we {{consumed}} the roast and boiled meat set before us; for I dared not hazard even the most commonplace remark for fear of rousing my volcanic host into a mad eruption. When we had finished eating, Demetria rose and brought her father a cigarette. It was the signal that supper was over; and immediately afterwards she left the room, followed by the two servants. Don Hilario politely offered me a cigarette and lit one for himself. For some minutes we smoked in silence, until the old man gradually dropped to sleep in his chair, after which we rose {{and went back to}} the kitchen. Even that sombre retreat now seemed cheerful after the silence and gloom of the dining-room. Presently Don Hilario got up, and, with many apologies for leaving me, explaining that he had been invited to assist at a dance at a neighbouring estancia, took himself off. Soon afterwards, though it was only about nine o'clock, I was shown to a room where a bed had been prepared for me. It was a large, musty-smelling apartment, almost empty, there being only my bed and a few tall, <b>upright</b> <b>chairs</b> bound <b>with</b> leather and black with age. The floor was tiled, and the ceiling was covered with a dusty canopy of cobwebs, on which flourished a numerous colony of long-legged house-spiders. I had no disposition to sleep at that early hour, and even envied Don Hilario, away enjoying himself with the Rocha beauties. My door, looking out to the front, was standing wide open; the full moon had just risen and was filling the night with its mystic splendour. Putting out my candle, for the house was now all dark and silent, I softly went out for a stroll. Under a clump of trees not far off I found an old rustic bench, and sat down on it; for the place was all such a tangled wilderness of great weeds that walking was scarcely practicable and very unpleasant.|$|R

60|$|This {{is as much}} {{almost as}} anyone need know to begin essay writing. Given your proper pen and ink, or pencil and paper, you simply sit down and write the thing. The value of an essay is not its matter, but its mood. You must be comfortable, of course; an easy-chair <b>with</b> <b>arm-rests,</b> slippers, and a book to write upon are usually employed, {{and you must be}} fed recently, and your body clothed with ease rather than grandeur. For the rest, do not trouble to stick to your subject, or any subject; and take no thought for the editor or the reader, for your essay should be as {{spontaneous}} as the lilies of the field.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was only}} one man left; a short-legged, long-bodied, plethoric fellow, with a very large, sandy head. He sat by himself, {{with a glass of}} port wine negus, and a spoon; sipping and stirring, and meditating and sipping, until nothing was left but the spoon. He {{gradually}} fell asleep bolt <b>upright</b> in his <b>chair,</b> <b>with</b> the empty glass standing before him; and the candle seemed to fall asleep too, for the wick grew long, and black, and cabbaged at the end, and dimmed the little light that remained in the chamber. The gloom that now prevailed was contagious. Around hung the shapeless, and almost spectral, box-coats of departed travellers, long since buried in deep sleep. I only heard the ticking of the clock, with the deep-drawn breathings of the sleeping topers, and the drippings of the rain, drop--drop--drop, from the eaves of the house. The church-bells chimed midnight. All at once the stout gentleman began to walk overhead, pacing slowly backwards and forwards. There was something extremely awful in all this, especially to one in my state of nerves. These ghastly greatcoats, these guttural breathings, and the creaking footsteps of this mysterious being. His steps grew fainter and fainter, and at length died away. I could bear it no longer. I was wound up to the desperation of a hero of romance. [...] "Be he who or what he may," [...] said I to myself, [...] "I'll have a sight of him!" [...] I seized a chamber candle, and hurried up to number 13. The door stood ajar. I hesitated--I entered: the room was deserted. There stood a large, broad-bottomed elbow chair at a table, on which was an empty tumbler, and a [...] "Times" [...] newspaper, and the room smelt powerfully of Stilton cheese.|$|R
60|$|Here M. le Comte {{invited her}} to sit in an <b>upright</b> <b>chair</b> which was placed at a {{convenient}} angle close to his bureau while he himself sat upon a stately throne-like armchair, one shapely knee bent, the other slightly stretched forward, displaying the fine silk stocking and the set of his well-cut, satin breeches. Mme. la Duchesse kept her hands folded in front of her, and waited in silence for her brother to speak, but he seemed at a loss how to begin, for her piercing gaze was making him feel very uncomfortable: {{he could not help}} but detect in it the twinkle of good-humoured sarcasm.|$|R

500|$|The {{set of the}} new {{studio was}} given a sleeker, more formal look, {{including}} a backdrop of three large projection screens. The traditional guests' couch, which had {{been a part of}} the set since the show's premiere, was done away with in favor of simple <b>upright</b> <b>chairs.</b> The change was initially not well-received, spawning a backlash among some fans and prompting a [...] "Bring Back the Couch" [...] campaign. The campaign was mentioned on subsequent shows by Stewart and supported by Daily Show contributor Bob Wiltfong. The couch was eventually featured in a sweepstakes in which the winner received the couch, round-trip tickets to New York, tickets to the show, and a small sum of money.|$|R
60|$|The {{advantage}} of having {{plenty of time}} on one's hands is that one has leisure {{to attend to the}} affairs of all one's circle of friends; and Archie, assiduously as he watched over the destinies of the Sausage Chappie, did not neglect the romantic needs of his brother-in-law Bill. A few days later, Lucille, returning one morning to their mutual suite, found her husband seated in an <b>upright</b> <b>chair</b> at the table, an unusually stern expression on his amiable face. A large cigar was {{in the corner of his}} mouth. The fingers of one hand rested in the armhole of his waistcoat: with the other hand he tapped menacingly on the table.|$|R

At times he felt painfully drowsy, but he had learned to overcome most bodily weaknesses, and his eyes only left the dark, plodding figures in front of him when he swept a searching glance across the plain. Nothing moved on it, and only the soft crunch of snow broke the dreary silence. At last, a cluster of low buildings rose out of the waste, and soon afterward Flett got down with difficulty and demanded shelter. The rudely awakened farmer gave him the use of his kitchen, in which a stove was burning; and while the Indians went to sleep on the floor, Flett, choosing an uncomfortable <b>upright</b> <b>chair,</b> lighted his pipe and sat down to keep another vigil. When dawn broke, his eyes were still open, though his face was a little haggard and very weary.|$|R
