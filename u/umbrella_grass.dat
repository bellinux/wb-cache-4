It reveals that 64. 70 % goodwill generates among the users through maintaining good relations by the library staff, 64 % rendering quality services, 92 % leadership, promptness, and skillful policy, 84. 70 by creating well behaviour with various types of readers, 47. 05 % library staff should be punctual in timing with attachment and affinity in public library readers as they comes under the <b>umbrella</b> of <b>grass</b> root users. The goodwill generates 80. 83 % intangible asset which invisible and 92. 50 % develop publicity of library automatically. It was concluded that goodwill totally depends on the behaviour and prompt services to the users to save their times...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of Study: The UV {{spectrum}} under public shade structures has {{not been}} previously investigated. This research compares the UV spectrum beneath four common shade structures with that of total solar UV, for relatively cloud-free sky conditions and changing solar zenith angle. No action spectrum exists for human melanoma, but the fish melanoma action spectrum may possibly provide {{an indication of the}} effective wavelengths for human melanoma development. Methodology: The protective nature of the shade environments was investigated by measuring the spectral UV in 1 nm increments in the shade for the three planes of horizontal, 45 o and vertical, and comparing it to that on a horizontal plane in full sun. The solar UV {{in the shade of a}} shade umbrella, covered veranda, covered sandpit and covered walkway was measured for an increasing solar zenith angle, between March and August. Results: For a shade <b>umbrella</b> on dry <b>grass</b> with no surrounding vegetation, UV levels in the shade weighted with the fish melanoma action spectrum reached approximately 65 % of those in full sun. For a covered sandpit with trees and shrubs in close proximity, UV levels were less than half those for the shade umbrella. The covered walkway and northern facing veranda received potentially damaging UV levels of approximately 39 % and 15 % respectively, for fish melanoma. An increasing solar zenith angle increased the relative damaging UV in the shade. Conclusions: The biologically damaging UV for fish melanoma was far from zero in the shade. This may have significant implications for humans...|$|R

40|$|Composite {{material}} {{could be}} developed into new material that would be useful for many interests. Fiber as composite raw material must be given pretreatment {{to improve the quality}} of composite. In this research, raw material for the composite was <b>umbrella</b> <b>grass</b> (Cyperus Alternifolius). A tool was designed to facilitate the processes of rolling or pressing, or abbreviated as roll press. Indeed, the design of roll press was preceded by designing the construction section that involved shaft, transmission system, bearing, pulley belt, and driver motor to move the roll. Result of rolling must be suitable for processing <b>umbrella</b> <b>grass</b> into the fiber of composite raw material. Testing was conduced to examine the work of the tool against the stalk of <b>umbrella</b> <b>grass.</b> Two testing was considered. First was testing against the variation of loads, which involved 10 kg, 12 kg and 14 kg. Second test was against the variation of roll rotation at 160 rpm, 197 rpm and 280 rpm. Result of both tests provided specific fiber derived from <b>umbrella</b> <b>grass</b> that would be compatible to be composite material. Some results of research were indicated. Main drive motor was ½ PK with rotation (n 1) = 1430 rpm. Pulley diameter (d 1) was 75 mm. Reducer system was signified by n 2 = 831 rpm and d 2 = 129 mm, and if d 3 = 59 mm was used, the outcome was n 4 = 160 rpm with d 4 = 307 mm. In case of bearing, its sliding moment was 0. 309 N. mm and tangent force was 2. 06 N. The frame of roll press tool was designed at the dimension of length x wide x height = 600 mm x 320 mm x 1200 mm. The best parameter was 160 rpm with load force of 10 kg. By taking account all these results, it could be said that the result of roll press processing had successfully produced the fiber from <b>umbrella</b> <b>grass</b> into the suitable raw material for the composite...|$|E
40|$|A lab-scale {{vertical}} flow cinder bed {{was set up}} {{to treat}} domestic wastewater. Cinder, which is a common coal waste from electricity generation, was used as the filter medium in the six vertical flow column beds in this study. Three of the six columns were planted with <b>umbrella</b> <b>grass</b> (Cyperus alternifolius) to mimic a wetland system and to investigate the effects of plant on the pollutant removal efficiencies of the column bed systems. The six column beds were divided into three groups, operating with different durations of “wet” and “dry” periods. Group 2 column beds, with 4 hours “wet” periods and 4 hours “dry” periods, showed the highest carbonaceous removal. And similar ammonia nitrogen removal efficiencies were demonstrated in column beds of group 2 and in column beds of group 3 (6 hours “wet” periods and 2 hours “dry” periods). Phosphorus removal efficiencies were not significantly different in all groups of column bed. No significant differences in pollutant removal were observed between planted and unplanted column beds in this study (p > 0. 05). Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
