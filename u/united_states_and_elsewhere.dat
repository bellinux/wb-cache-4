5|$|Irish or English Irish – In England, the Irish is {{standardized}} by the NFRS as an {{equilateral triangle}} of white {{with a side}} that begins at the chest, or between the front legs, and where the point ends mid length. In the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere,</b> clubs like the AFRMA distinguish this marking as the English Irish and allow for another standardized Irish in which the rat may have white of an even or symmetrical nature anywhere along its underside.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{has had a}} broad {{impact on}} popular culture, both in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> Dozens of English-language idioms have been derived from baseball; in particular, the game {{is the source of}} a number of widely used sexual euphemisms. The first {{networked}} radio broadcasts in North America were of the 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play-by-play from New York City's Polo Grounds on WJZ–Newark, New Jersey, which was connected by wire to WGY–Schenectady, New York, and WBZ–Springfield, Massachusetts. The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Conspiracy theorists, such as American writer Jim Marrs, {{claim that}} some ex-Nazis, {{who survived the}} fall of the Greater German Reich, along with sympathizers in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere,</b> given haven by {{organizations}} like ODESSA and Die Spinne, have been working behind the scenes since the end of World War II to enact at least some principles of Nazism (e.g., militarism, imperialism, widespread spying on citizens, corporatism, the use of propaganda to manufacture a national consensus) into culture, government, and business worldwide, but primarily in the U.S. They cite the influence of ex-Nazi scientists brought in under Operation Paperclip to help advance aerospace manufacturing in the U.S. with technological principles from Nazi UFOs, and the acquisition and creation of conglomerates by ex-Nazis and their sympathizers after the war, in both Europe and the U.S.|$|E

5|$|The {{severing}} of workers' hands achieved particular international notoriety. These {{were sometimes}} {{cut off by}} rogue Force Publique soldiers who were made to account for every shot they fired by bringing back {{the hands of their}} victims. These details were recorded by Christian missionaries working in the Congo and caused public outrage when they were made known to the public in the United Kingdom, Belgium, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> An international campaign against the Congo Free State began in 1890 and reached its apogee after 1900 under the leadership of the British activist E. D. Morel. In 1908, as a result of international pressure, the Belgian government annexed the Congo Free State to form the Belgian Congo, and ended many of the systems responsible for the abuses. The size of the population decline during the period is the subject of extensive historiographical debate, and there is an open debate as to whether the atrocities constitute genocide.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{can cause}} {{opportunistic}} infections in weakened or immunocompromised humans. It is most {{commonly associated with}} bacteremic cellulitis, but {{has been known to}} cause endocarditis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. The first recognized cases of human infection occurred in Texas in 1991 and in Ottawa in 1994, but the sources of infection were not determined. Human infection with S.iniae was also identified in Toronto between 15 and 20 December 1995, when three Asian patients were admitted to a hospital with cellulitis of the hand after injuring themselves while handling raw fish. All three were found to have bacteremia, initially attributed to Streptococcus uberis, but later correctly identified as S.iniae. In February 1996, a Chinese man was admitted to the same hospital with sepsis one week after preparing a fresh whole tilapia, and was also diagnosed with S.iniae bacteremia. A subsequent epidemiological investigation found other cases in the Toronto area, for a total of nine patients; all were of Asian descent and all had handled raw fish (mostly tilapia) before developing infection. Other cases were later identified in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in Canada, and have since been reported in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore). Asian descent is a common trend in the majority of invasive human cases, but it is unknown whether this is due to inherent differences in immunity or because of cultural differences in the fish preparation which lend themselves to a higher incidence of infection.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{financial}} crisis of 2007-2008, legislators unsuccessfully tried to reinstate Glass–Steagall Sections 20 and 32 {{as part of the}} Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Both in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere,</b> banking reforms have been proposed that refer to Glass–Steagall principles. These proposals include issues of “ring fencing” commercial banking operations and narrow banking proposals that would sharply reduce the permitted activities of commercial banks.|$|E

25|$|The {{export of}} trees felled by {{cyclones}} is permitted, opening a loophole {{since the government}} never inventories downed trees. Thus, the timber barons export logs that have been harvested previously, claiming they were a result of storm damage—a technique historically employed by loggers in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> The high density of rosewood prevents them from blowing over in cyclones, leading environmental activists to believe the only purpose is to facilitate illegal logging.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years of}} its existence, with the {{exception}} of films and purchased programmes from the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere,</b> almost all the channel's output was produced by the BBC's in-house production departments. This changed following the Broadcasting Act 1990, which required that 25% of the BBC's television output be out-sourced to independent production companies. By 2004 many popular BBC One shows were made for the channel by independents, but the in-house production departments continued to contribute heavily to the schedule.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in the world, {{there has}} been a marked rise in the evangelical wing of Protestant denominations, {{especially}} those that are more exclusively evangelical, and a corresponding decline in the mainstream liberal churches. In the post–World War I era, Liberal Christianity was on the rise, and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well. In the post–World War II era, the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America's seminaries and church structures.|$|E

More {{than a quarter}} of Ireland's population watched the match live on RTÉ Two and RTÉ Online, the second highest audience in eight years. Donegal's success spawned a controversial interview with Ryan Tubridy on The Late Late Show the following week, as well as the documentary Jimmy's Winnin' Matchesits title derived from the similarly named anthem that celebrated Donegal's 2012 Championship success.|$|E
25|$|Barbara Mary Ward, Baroness Jackson of Lodsworth (23 May 1914 – 31 May 1981) was a British {{economist}} and writer {{interested in the}} problems of developing countries. She urged Western governments to share their prosperity {{with the rest of}} the world and in the 1960s turned her attention to environmental questions as well. She was an early advocate of sustainable development before this term became familiar and was well known as a journalist, lecturer and broadcaster. Ward was adviser to policy-makers in the UK, <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere.</b>|$|E
25|$|Trade organizations, {{industry}} groups and environmental advocates have sharply criticized EII’s {{program in the}} <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere,</b> which is mostly based on self-certifications by fishing captains that they didn’t kill dolphins. The groups argue that EII’s dolphin-safe tuna “label means absolutely nothing in terms of sustainability. That label {{has been used to}} can tuna that could have caused severe mortalities of dolphins and other marine species of the ecosystem.” The issue has created economic and diplomatic tension between the U.S. and Mexico. The U.S. ban has been blamed for severe economic problems in fishing villages like Ensenada.|$|E
