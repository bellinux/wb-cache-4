6000|$|Their affliction {{brought the}} Dryfooses into humaner {{relations}} with the Marches, who had hitherto regarded them as a necessary evil, as the odious means of their own prosperity. Mrs. March found that {{the women of the}} family seemed glad of her coming, and in the sense of her usefulness to them all she began to feel a kindness even for Christine. But she could not help seeing that between the girl and her father there was an <b>unsettled</b> <b>account,</b> somehow, and that it was Christine and not the old man who was holding out. She thought that their sorrow had tended to refine the others. Mela was much more subdued, and, except when she abandoned herself to a childish interest in her mourning, she did nothing to shock Mrs. March's taste or to seem unworthy of her grief. She was very good to her mother, whom the blow had left unchanged, and to her father, whom it had apparently fallen upon with crushing weight. Once, after visiting their house, Mrs. March described to March a little scene between Dryfoos and Mela, when he came home from Wall Street, and the girl met him at the door with a kind of country simpleness, and took his hat and stick, and brought him into the room where Mrs. March sat, looking tired and broken. She found this look of Dryfoos's pathetic, and dwelt on the sort of stupefaction there was in it; he must have loved his son more than they ever realized. [...] "Yes," [...] said March, [...] "I suspect he did. He's never been about the place since that day; he was always dropping in before, on his way up-town. He seems to go down to Wall Street every day, just as before, but I suppose that's mechanical; he wouldn't know what else to do; I dare say it's best for him. The sanguine Fulkerson is getting a little anxious about the future of 'Every Other Week.' Now Conrad's gone, he isn't sure the old man will want to keep on with it, or whether he'll have to look up another Angel. He wants to get married, I imagine, and he can't venture till this point is settled." ...|$|E

Novels such as New Grub Street expose high culture's dependence on the ruthless Darwinism of late Victorian capitalism: literary and personal success can only be achieved by understanding and adapting to the immanent and irresistible nature of a market hostile to the development of human self-betterment. Situated against nineteenth-century analyses of monetary relations by thinkers such as Ruskin, Mill, Marx and Carlyle, and novels by Dickens, Eliot and Hardy, <b>Unsettled</b> <b>Accounts</b> demonstrates how Gissing's work is engagingly modern, dealing as it does with changes {{in the nature of the}} literary market, advertising, imperialism, the New Woman, and the condition of the working classes. This groundbreaking new study, published 100 years after Gissing's death, will be of considerable interest to students, researchers, and scholars. A valuable introduction to Gissing's work, it claims a prominent place for him in fin-de-siècle Victorian literature. ...|$|R
5000|$|Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases was {{a company}} that sold propane for {{commercial}} and home purposes, {{in addition to other}} gases like helium and acetylene. The company has operated under a number of names since at least 1999. In 2002, a company named Sunrise Petroleum was successfully sued by First Choice Petroleum Inc., an oil and lubricants supplier, that claimed the company owed them C$54,063.73 in products and that Sunrise forged a document to avoid settling their account. In that case, it was found that Sunrise had forged the signature of a First Choice employee named Thomas Tims in a 1999 document, which stated Sunrise Petroleum would be taken over by a new company called Sunrise Petroleum Lubricants, and that Sunrise Petroleum would thereby not be responsible for any outstanding, unpaid, or <b>unsettled</b> <b>accounts.</b> However, Tims would not have signed the document because he was listed on it as [...] "Tim Toms", rather than Tom Tims. As a result of the case, Sunrise was forced to pay the account owed plus interest, totalling C$93,389.54, and an additional C$34,284.71 in legal fees. Court documents also revealed a third name, Sunrise Propane & Petroleum, that the company had previously used.|$|R

While Gillion fails to dwell on the presence in Calcutta of these Islanders from the South Seas, his provocative aside troubles the popular view of Fijians as sedentary subjects of a colonial policy that discouraged the disruption of traditional life-worlds. It also calls into question the general perception that girmit or ‘indentured service’ was an exclusively Indian affair. Although they were not indentured to colonial plantations, the Islanders shared with the coolies the micropolitical spaces of the depot, the ship and the quarantine station. They participated in the regimes and regulations of the indenture system. These Fijians <b>unsettle</b> two distinct <b>accounts</b> of history by not conforming to either.

40|$|PhDVictorian medical men, writers, {{relatives}} of the dying and consumptive sufferers themselves seized on the narrative potential of representations of the disease {{in a variety of}} ways. I argue that both medical and lay writers subscribed to a common set of beliefs about the disease and that medical knowledge, moreover, shared a common narrative way of knowing and understanding it. I analyse aspects of general clinical expository texts, including accompanying illustrations, showing how a narrative knowledge of death and the tubercular body was elaborated. Furthermore, I show how documents used in the compilation of medical statistics on the cause of death were fundamentally narrative through their reliance on case narratives. It is demonstrated that Dickens uses a seldom noticed consumptive death and decline to offset his heroine's development in Bleak House, in ways similar to those developed in Jane Eyre. Similarly, it is shown that Mrs Gaskell's use of a consumptive alcoholic 'fallen woman' <b>unsettles</b> her <b>account</b> of her heroine in Mary Barton. George Eliot's 'Janet's Repentance' is analysed, showing how the psychological struggle between an orientation towards life or death is played out across both alcoholism and consumption. I also examine how consumption presents a narrative opportunity whereby plots involving setbacks in love are resolved through women's consumptive deaths in popular fiction by Rhoda Broughton,Ladv Georgiana Fullerton and others. Through an examination of the Journal of Emily Shore and accounts of other actual deaths, I illustrate how experiences and accounts of consumptive deaths were structured and rendered intelligible through reliance on beliefs encountered in both fiction and medicine. In conclusion, the thesis alerts readers to the presence of signifiers of consumption in Victorian texts, showing how various narrative strategies are integral to any understanding of representations of its dying victim...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge {{management}} is frequently suggested to {{be essential to}} sustained competitive advantage and continued business success. Knowledge management and organisational learning are twin constructs: organisational learning is {{the end result of}} knowledge management. Knowledge management has its roots in it/is, and many authors treat it as an it problem with it solutions, whilst the barriers to knowledge management are treated as largely people oriented. However, it/is can do no more than provide a repository for explicit knowledge the knowledge which is available to the organisation. It cannot store tacit knowledge that which belongs to the individual and resides in people's heads. It can only support knowledge it is not the driver of knowledge management. Codification, exploration and exploitation are three modes of organisational knowledge production and transmission. Accounting is a primary source of codified knowledge. Many of the current developments in management accounting are designed to facilitate knowledge exploration - new, <b>unsettled</b> knowledge. <b>Accounting</b> has the potential to recombine existing knowledge in different ways with different reports - the exploitation of knowledge. Accountants however must take a broader perspective if they are to provide the expertise to explore and exploit knowledge, not just codify it. The level of knowledge transfer or sharing within an organisation depends {{on the nature of the}} task and the nature of interactions between professionals. With routine tasks and low interactions, relatively standard but organisation-specific accounting reports will facilitate knowledge transfer. Standardised accounting reports with codified rules and procedures are appropriate when tasks are routine and interactions are high. With non-routine tasks and low interactions, individual accounting expertise with tailored information is important for knowledge management. Collaboration, informal co-ordination and knowledge sharing of tailored accounting information are required for non-routine tasks and high interactions. Performance measurement enhances knowledge management by providing general knowledge about the organisation; by the use of specific knowledge-based performance indicators as found for example in the balanced scorecard; and by the use of intellectual capital statements...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{the author}} {{tells the story}} of her search for {{appropriate}} tools to conceptualise policy work. She had set out to explore the rela tionship between the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Australia’s education policy, but early intervie w data forced her to reconsider her research question. The plethora of availabl e models of policy did not satisf actorily accommodate her growing understanding of the messiness and complexity of policy work. On the basis of interviews with 18 policy actors, including former OECD officials, PISA analysts and bureaucrats, as well as documentary analysis of government reports and ministerial me dia releases, she suggests that the concept of ‘assemblage’ provides the tools to better understand the messy processes of policy work. The relationship between PISA and national policy is of interest to many scholars in Europe, making this study widely relevant. An article th at argues for the <b>unsettling</b> of tidy <b>accounts</b> of knowledge making in policy can hardly afford to obscure the untidiness of its own assemblage. Accordingly, this article is somewhat unconventional in its presentation, and atte mpts to take the reader into the messiness of the research world as well as the polic y world.

40|$|Scholars of Islamic law {{point to}} the absence of any extant work of legal theory between the Ris 2 ̆ 6 amacr;la of al-Sh 2 ̆ 6 amacr;fi‘ 2 ̆ 6 imacr; and the Fus 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; 2 ̆ 6 umacr;l of al-Jas 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow;s 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; 2 ̆ 6 amacr;s 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; as a major barrier to reconstructing the history of Islamic legal thought. However, careful {{analysis}} of three major works of the H 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow;anaf 2 ̆ 6 imacr; jurist al-T 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow;ah 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; 2 ̆ 6 amacr;w 2 ̆ 6 imacr;, Ah 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow;k 2 ̆ 6 amacr;m al-Qur’ 2 ̆ 6 amacr;n, Sharh 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; ma‘ 2 ̆ 6 amacr;n 2 ̆ 6 imacr; al- 2 ̆ 6 amacr;th 2 ̆ 6 amacr;r and Sharh 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; mushkil al- 2 ̆ 6 amacr;th 2 ̆ 6 amacr;r, reveals the existence of myriad brief passages elaborating questions of legal theory scattered throughout their many volumes. This study reconstructs the legal thought of al-T 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow;ah 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; 2 ̆ 6 amacr;w 2 ̆ 6 imacr; as a window onto legal theory in the late 3 rd/ 9 th and early 4 th/ 10 th centuries, a crucial period of transformation between late formative and post-formative Islamic law. It argues that al-T 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow;ah 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; 2 ̆ 6 amacr;w 2 ̆ 6 imacr;’s works are not direct precursors to the genre of us 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; 2 ̆ 6 umacr;l al-fiqh, but instead represent a different, previously unrecognized, type of intellectual and literary activity. This activity, here termed practical hermeneutics, is concerned with demonstrating in detail how individually coherent rules of law may be derived from the often messy texts of revelation. The integrated reading of al-T 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow;ah 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; 2 ̆ 6 amacr;w 2 ̆ 6 imacr;’s entire hermeneutical corpus uncovers several areas in which his legal thought departs quite notably from that of other jurists, suggesting that al-T 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow;ah 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; 2 ̆ 6 amacr;w 2 ̆ 6 imacr; was neither as dependent on al-Shafi‘ 2 ̆ 6 imacr; nor as closely related to mature us 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; 2 ̆ 6 umacr;l al-fiqh as has been suggested in previous studies. Most crucially, al-T 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow;ah 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; 2 ̆ 6 amacr;w 2 ̆ 6 imacr;’s works <b>unsettle</b> accepted <b>accounts</b> of Islamic legal theory which assign varying levels of authority to a series of clearly distinguished legal sources—Qur’ 2 ̆ 6 amacr;n, Sunna, consensus, etc. This study demonstrates that, in contrast to both al-Sh 2 ̆ 6 amacr;fi‘ 2 ̆ 6 imacr; and later us 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; 2 ̆ 6 umacr;l 2 ̆ 6 imacr;s, al-T 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow;ah 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; 2 ̆ 6 amacr;w 2 ̆ 6 imacr;’s legal thought blurs boundaries between these categories and instead rests upon an underlying binary concept of legal authority which draws a crucial distinction between knowledge that might permissibly be reached by inference, and knowledge that can only have come from revelation. The authority that al-T 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow;ah 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow; 2 ̆ 6 amacr;w 2 ̆ 6 imacr; grants any given source is therefore not a function of its formal characteristics, but rather the result of his own judgment about content and origins. ...|$|R
40|$|Diante das crises e escândalos financeiros ocorridos no mundo todo, a profissão do auditor independente passou a ser questionada com relação ao seu papel a ser desempenhado perante a sociedade. Entretanto, vale destacar que as exigências por parte da sociedade podem ser exageradas ou estar além do esperado para este profissional, gerando diferenças de expectativas entre o que se espera e o que de fato o auditor oferece. Essas desigualdades advêm da interpretação do relatório (antigamente denominado parecer) do auditor e seus usuários, e o que acontece com as empresas então auditadas. Atualmente no Brasil, o relatório apresenta parágrafos padrões, independentemente do cliente e/ou indústria auditada, {{inclusive}} a opinião final, que pode ser modificada ou não. Além disso, é empregado um linguajar rebuscado e quase incompreensível para as pessoas que não pertencem à área, conforme pesquisas acadêmicas e também aquelas realizadas pelo IAASB. O auditor independente apresenta e representa um papel importante e fundamental para o mercado de capitais, influenciando a percepção do valor da auditoria, e os usuários das demonstrações contábeis passaram a exigir mais informações por parte desse profissional, a fim de possuir, de fato, as bases que fundamentam suas conclusões, além de reconhecer os riscos a que está sujeita determinada Companhia auditada. Diante dessa demanda, após muitas pesquisas, debates, entrevistas e discussões, constatou-se que o relatório do auditor independente precisa de alterações na forma de comunicação, de modo a proporcionar maior transparência, atendendo aos anseios dos seus usuários. Normas de auditoria foram revistas e o novo relatório foi implementado em alguns países, tais como Reino Unido e Holanda, pioneiros em relação às novas atribuições desse profissional. No Brasil, o novo relatório passará a vigorar a partir do exercício de 2016. Diante dessas implicações, a pesquisa qualitativa buscou, através de fundamentação bibliográfica e análise documental, examinar se, com essa nova forma de comunicação, é possível auxiliar a delimitação das incumbências do auditor independente, fortalecendo sua imagem, abalada por fraudes contábeis, atribuídas primariamente como responsabilidade desse profissional. Com isso, fez-se necessário analisar se quesitos-chave das normas das principais jurisdições podem auxiliar na delimitação da responsabilidade do auditor, como também as apreciações de relatórios de duas empresas auditadas do Reino Unido e Holanda e, a partir disso, como consideração geral, constata-se que a mudança na forma da comunicação do auditor independente é um grande passo e evidencia que os auditores passaram a atentar às reivindicações de seus usuáriosThe {{occupation of}} independent auditor {{has come to}} be questioned as to its role to be played in the face of society up against to crises and financial scandals worldwide. However, it is remarkable that the demands from society can be excessive or be beyond the expected for this professional, causing differences in expectations between what is expected an what actually the auditor offers. These inequalities arise from the interpretation of the auditor s report and its users, and what happens with the audited companies. Nowadays, in Brazil, the report presents standards paragraphs, regardless of customer and/or audited industry, including the final opinion, that can be modified or not. Also, it is used an elaborate language and almost incomprehensible to people outside the area, according academic researches as well as those carried out by the IAASB. The auditor presents and represents an important and key role in the capital market, prepossessing the sense of audit value, and the users of Financial Statements have demanded more information from this professional, in order to have, in fact, the foundation underlying its conclusions, in addition to recognize the risks to which certain audited Company is subject. Given this requirement, after several researches, debates, interviews and discussions, it was noticed that the independent auditor s report needs to change in the form of communication, to afford a better transparency, mainly answering the wishes of the users. Auditing standards have been revised and the new report has been implemented in some countries, such as the UK and Netherlands, pioneers regarding new assignments of this professional. In Brazil, the new report will be effective from 2016. Given these implications, the qualitative research looked after, through literature basis and document analysis, to verify whether, facing this new form of communication, it is possible to assist the delimitation of tasks of independent auditor, reinforcing his image, <b>unsettled</b> by <b>accounting</b> fraud, assigned primarily such as the responsibility of this professional. From there, it was necessary to analyze if the key questions of the rules of major jurisdictions can assist in defining the auditor's responsibility, as well as assessments of the two audited company reports from the UK and the Netherlands and, from that, as a general consideration, {{it is clear that the}} change in the communication of the independent auditor is a big step and shows that auditors started to pay attention to the claims of the users of Financial Statement...|$|R
