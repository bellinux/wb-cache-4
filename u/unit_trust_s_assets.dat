Both Jensen‟s measure and Treynor-Mazuy regression analysis provide reasonable evidence to support the findings of the <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> performances. This study highlights that the returns of the conventional and Islamic <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> has outperformed the market throughout Feb 1995 to Jul 2009. Strategic market timing with right assessment of market conditions can be a tactic for the <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> managers to obtain superior performance. In addition of that, an attempt is made to answer the question of whether past performance can be used to predict future performance of the <b>unit</b> <b>trust.</b> In general, the behaviour of Islamic <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> does not differ from the conventional <b>unit</b> <b>trust,</b> nonetheless this study realize that Islamic <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> is the best hedging investment against the economic recession compare to conventional. In summary, this study evaluates the effect of <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> performance have important implications for investors, fund managers and <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> regulatory in Malaysia for more efficient future decision making of the <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> investing...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the efficiency of selected conventional and Islamic <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> companies in Malaysia during the period 2002 to 2005. Design/methodology/approach – The paper adopts Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to investigate efficiency, as measured by the Malmquist index, which is decomposed into two components: efficiency change and technical change indexes. Findings – The study indicates that technical efficiency is the main contributor to enhancing the efficiency of the Malaysian <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> industry. In addition, the larger the size of the <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> companies, the more inefficient the performance. In comparing the efficiency of <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> companies, the study finds that some of the Islamic <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> companies perform better than their conventional counterparts. Research limitations/implications – The study is limited to five Islamic <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> companies. Thus, the findings of this study are indicative, but inconclusive for the <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> industry as a whole. Practical implications – The results have two important implications for both conventional and Islamic <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> companies in Malaysia. First, the deterioration of total factor productivity (TFP) in the <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> industry in Malaysia is due to the deficiency of innovation in technical components. Second, the size of the <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> companies has an adverse effect on the TFP performance. Originality/value – The contribution of this study is that it analyzes the efficiency of the two types of <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> industry which are important and relevant for Malaysia. This significance arises from the dual financial system, in which the Islamic <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> companies operate in parallel with their conventional counterparts. The comparison sheds some light on the performance of the Islamic <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> companies, whose operations are based on profit-sharing, in contrast to the conventional <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> companies.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{comparison}} of performance between Islamic and conventional <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> funds in Malaysia. Least Square Methods were {{used to describe the}} overall growth of Malaysian <b>unit</b> <b>trusts</b> for the years 2004 to 2012 {{based on the number of}} launched funds, units in circulation, number of accounts and total net asset value. The results indicated that conventional <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> funds grew exponentially while Islamic <b>unit</b> <b>trusts</b> grew linearly. The performances of 4 Islamic and 4 conventional <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> funds based on their efficiencies (ratio of weighted sum of outputs to weighted sum of inputs) were measured using Data Envelopment Analysis over a three-year period (2010 - 2012). The performances were measured based on two inputs namely the Portfolio Turnover Ratio (PTR) and Management Expense Ratio (MER) while the output was the companies’ annual returns. The outcome is the ranking of <b>unit</b> <b>trusts</b> performance which can be a good reference for investors. The finding shows that conventional <b>unit</b> <b>trusts</b> were the preferred investment among Malaysians. However, the growth of Islamic <b>unit</b> <b>trusts</b> was less affected by the world economic crisis compared to the growth of conventional <b>unit</b> <b>trusts.</b> This is reflected in the decrease of growth of the conventional <b>unit</b> <b>trusts</b> during the years 2007 - 2008, the time when the world economy was hit hard. On the contrary, the Islamic <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> showed a gradually increasing growth during the same time period. CIMB conventional is found to be the best <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> among the conventional <b>unit</b> <b>trusts</b> studied while Kuwait Finance House is found to be the best Islamic <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> in this study, second only to CIMB conventional.

A <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> is an investment vehicle that pools money from numerous investors {{to invest in a}} portfolio of shares, bonds, deposits and other risky instruments. In <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> investments, the decision on which securities to purchase or sell is delegated to a professional fund manager. Like mutual funds in the U.

The average Active Share demonstrated by the sample of <b>unit</b> <b>trusts</b> has decreased from 60. 85 % in June 2007 to 55. 65 % in June 2013. A fund flow analysis confirmed that fund managers' portfolio decisions are highly affected by the risk of outflows and possibility of inflows. Managers faced with a high risk of outflows and low possibility of inflows adjusted their Active Share by approximately double that of managers with a moderate risk of outflows and inflows. A similar result was found when comparing managers experiencing a low risk of outflows and a high possibility of inflows, to managers experiencing a moderate risk of outflows and inflows. Under varying market conditions, <b>unit</b> <b>trusts</b> exhibiting the highest Active Share and tracking error (concentrated stock picker) earned a significantly higher alpha than <b>unit</b> <b>trusts</b> exhibiting the lowest Active Share and tracking error (closet indexer).

Sharpe Index is used to characterize how well the return of <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> fund remunerate the investor for risk they have taken, where the higher the number the better. The Treynor Index relates the excess return over the risk-free rate to the additional risk taken, where the higher the ratio indicates the better the performance of the portfolio under analysis.

The performance is examined over two sub-periods and the overall examination period, where the first sub-period captures {{the performance of the}} <b>unit</b> <b>trusts</b> before the 2007 / 2008 global financial crisis and the second sub-period captures the devastation in performance of the <b>unit</b> <b>trusts</b> after the crisis. Active fund managers are usually presumed to possess superior abilities in asset allocation, security selection and market timing that assist them to consistently generate abnormal returns on a risk-adjusted basis. This research attempts to test this claim by making a distinction in performance attribution between returns generated as a result of managerial skills and those generated as a result of random chance. The study emerges by first examining the risk-adjusted performance of the South African <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> managers against the performance of a broad market index proxied by FTSE/JSE All Share Index (ALSI). Six different risk-adjusted performance measures are employed for this purpose. Regardless of the different applications of risk parameters employed by each performance measure, the results reveal that on average, most of the South African <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> managers do not outperform the market on a consistent basis. The majority of the <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> managers show good performance during the first sub-period, with subsequent inferiority in performance during the second sub-period. The study further examines the performance of the South African <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> managers relative to the pre-specified sector benchmarks constructed by following a set of performance attribution techniques proposed by Yu (2008) and Hsieh (2010). The objective of this test is to determine whether the equity <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> managers are able to create value through their security selection skill in addition to their asset allocation decisions. Consistent with international evidence, the results reveal that returns generated by South African <b>unit</b> <b>trusts</b> are driven mainly by asset allocation activities and stock picking of asset managers do not add significant value. In addition, test results also indicate that South African equity <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> managers are not good at managing risk as the majority of the <b>unit</b> <b>trusts</b> exhibit higher standard deviation compared to their benchmarks. Furthermore, the study examines the economic value contribution of the South African equity <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> managers through their market timing activities. In particular, the study attempts {{to determine whether or not}} <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> managers possess the ability to correctly anticipate future market movements. To achieve this, two market timing performance models developed by Treynor-Mazuy (1966) and Henrikson-Merton (1981) are employed. The results reveal that, regardless of the changes in market conditions, South African equity <b>unit</b> <b>trust</b> mangers delivered significantly inferior timing performance in both sub-periods and the overall examination periods that actually destroyed fund values. The paper concludes by stating that investors are better off by investing in cost-effective passive investment vehicles such as exchange traded funds (ETF's) ...|$|R
