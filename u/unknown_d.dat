60|$|Every fossil {{which takes}} an {{intermediate}} place between {{forms of life}} already known, may be said, {{so far as it}} is intermediate, to be evidence in favour of evolution, inasmuch as it shows a possible road by which evolution may have taken place. But the mere discovery of such a form does not, in itself, prove that evolution took place by and through it, nor does it constitute more than presumptive evidence in favour of evolution in general. Suppose A, B, C to be three forms, while B is intermediate in structure between A and C. Then the doctrine of evolution offers four possible alternatives. A may have become C by way of B; or C may have become A by way of B; or A and C may be independent modifications of B; or A, B, and C may be independent modifications of some <b>unknown</b> <b>D.</b> Take the case of the Pigs, the Anoplothcridoe, and the Ruminants. The Anoplothcridoe are intermediate between the first and the last; but this does not tell us whether the Ruminants have come from the Pigs, or the Pigs from Ruminants, or both from Anoplothcridoe, or whether Pigs, Ruminants, and Anoplotlicridoe alike may not have diverged from some common stock.|$|E

40|$|Abstract —We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} an autonomous robot searching for objects in <b>unknown</b> 3 <b>d</b> space. Similar to the well known frontier-based exploration in 2 d, the problem is to determine a minimal sequence of sensor viewpoints until the entire search space has been explored. We introduce a novel approach that combines the two concepts of voids, which are unexplored volumes in 3 d, and frontiers, which are regions on the boundary between voids and explored space. Our approach has been evaluated on a mobile platform using a 5 -DOF manipulator searching for victims in a simulated USAR setup. First results indicate the real-world capability and search efficiency of the proposed method. We {{consider the}} problem of an autonomous robot searching for objects in <b>unknown</b> 3 <b>d</b> space. Autonomous search is a fundamental problem in robotics that has many application areas ranging from household robots searching for objects i...|$|R
