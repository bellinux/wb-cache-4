Under the cover of naval and aerial bombardment, the 9th Division of the AIF landed on the bay and subsequently Maeda-shima on 10 June with a force of around 14,079 personnel half from a total of 30,000 that were assigned for the mission. With narrow roads and swampy conditions near the island beaches, the <b>unloading</b> <b>operations</b> by Royal Australian Engineers (RAE) were hampered while landings in the Brunei Bay are more easily made. The prediction of strong Japanese resistance however went fall as there only few air raids made against the Allied forces.|$|E

Citrus and two Liberty ships, [...] and SS McKenzie, transported Coast Guard construction crews to erect Quonset huts for Construction Detachment [...] "A" [...] at Massacre Bay, Attu and at Baxter Cove, Adak. Unloading at Adak was done with 5' x 7' steel pontoon-type barges. They arrived on 24 December 1943. Heavy ground swells made unloading materiel from the cutter to the barge precarious. Despite the possibility of a sudden squall, both barges made the beach about sundown.

[...] With the sea at their backs, a lack of mutual support between outposts, and the thorny scrub and cacti of the arid hills stretching in a dense tangle before them, the Marines had a less-than-ideal tactical position. [...] Commander McCalla pointed out to Lt. Col. Huntington that his outposts were too far forward and could not be seen or supported in the dense undergrowth between the outposts and the main camp. [...] Three of the companies stacked arms and returned to the ship to help with <b>unloading</b> <b>operations.</b> Shortly after sundown, the Marines had their first meal of coffee and hardtack.

This is a critical issue since an AGV is a costly resource and an augment in number does not necessarily correspond to an improved unloading speed.

50|$|In a load/unload control scheme, the {{compressor}} remains continuously powered. However, when {{the demand for}} compressed air is satisfied or reduced, instead of disconnecting power to {{the compressor}}, a device known as a slide valve is activated. This device uncovers part of the rotor and proportionately reduces capacity of the machine down to typically 25% of the compressors capability, thereby unloading the compressor. This reduces the number of start/stop cycles for electric motors over a start/stop control scheme in electrically-driven compressors, improving equipment service life with a minimal change in operating cost. This scheme is utilised by nearly all industrial air-compressor manufacturers. When a load/unload control scheme is combined with a timer to stop the compressor after a predetermined period of continuously <b>unloaded</b> <b>operation,</b> it {{is known as a}} dual-control or auto-dual scheme.|$|R
5000|$|On 26 July, after a rough transit {{which had}} taken her through the {{developing}} Typhoon [...] "Ora", the cargo ship returned to Vietnam at Cam Ranh Bay. The next day, she embarked men and equipment of the Army's 572rd Light Equipment Company for transportation north to Tuy Hòa. She anchored there the same day and began <b>unloading.</b> That <b>operation</b> lasted two days and proved difficult and hazardous due to the soft sand beach, large numbers of fishing craft and equipment crowding the area, and large amounts of debris. On the 29th, she headed north from Tuy Hòa to evacuate a South Vietnamese unit from Qui Nhơn. That reverse amphibious operation saved the unit the heavy casualties it would have sustained fighting its way south along routes held by strong insurgent forces. Winston departed Qui Nhơn on 31 July and delivered the South Vietnamese troops to Tuy Hòa that same day. Over {{the next three days}} and nights, she completed another difficult <b>unloading</b> <b>operation</b> complicated by the proximity of the enemy and the possibility of hostile fishing craft. She departed the Vietnamese coast on 3 August and, after a stop at Okinawa, arrived at Yokosuka on the 11th. A week later, she headed home, stopped at Pearl Harbor from 27 to 29 August, arrived back in San Diego on 5 September, and resumed local operations along the southern California coast.|$|R
50|$|He {{recommended}} that freight services should mainly be for minerals and coal, {{and that the}} freight system made use of new containerised handling systems rather than less efficient and slower wagon-load traffic. This was eventually adopted with Freightliner. The coal-handling operations of BR were to be significantly modernised; the report recommended the adoption of merry-go round trains, with automated loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>operation</b> while on the move, for bulk industrial coal traffic and the thousands of coal sidings at individual stations for serving domestic coal demand being closed and consolidated into 292 new House Coal Concentration Depots, with mechanised coal handling equipment and supplied by more efficient block trains. Both these policies were successfully implemented. Beeching also recommended further electrification of the West Coast Main Line from Crewe to Glasgow in 1974. Staff terms and conditions were to be improved over time.|$|R
