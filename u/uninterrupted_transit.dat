25|$|Because of {{domestic}} payment collection problems, Belarus accumulated debts for its gas imports. When disagreements over the political integration increased, Gazprom {{realized that the}} Belarusian debts would in future undermine the reliability of Belarusian transit routes. Consequently, Gazprom sought to establish a joint venture to own and operate the Belarusian transit network, to ensure <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>transit</b> of gas to Europe.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} week of November, Gazprom CEO Miller {{announced}} that if no agreement was reached {{by the end of the}} year, prices could rise significantly higher than what was currently being proposed. A few days later Prime Minister Putin warned that if there was any interference with transit gas, supplies to Ukraine would be cut off. These warnings were repeated throughout December, with additional warnings that disruptions to European supplies could result. The European Commission did not attempt to intervene, but the Energy Charter Secretariat issued a statement on December 23 which recalled the principle of <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>transit.</b> This was seen as a reminder to Ukraine of its obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty, which it has signed and, unlike Russia, ratified.|$|E
25|$|Deliveries of 90 mmcm (million cubic meters) {{of natural}} gas per day {{designated}} to Ukraine were fully cut on January 1, 2009 at 10:00 MSK. Transit deliveries to the EU continued at a volume of 300 mmcm per day. President Yushchenko and Prime Minister Tymoshenko, in a joint statement, confirmed that Ukraine guaranteed the <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>transit</b> of gas to Europe. They also promised that Ukrainian citizens would be provided with gas in full volume from Ukraine's gas storage facilities. According to Viachaslau Herasimovich, energy analyst at independent think-tank CASE Ukraine, Ukraine had enough natural gas to last between 100 and 110 days without Russian gas (reserves in underground storage were enough to last about 80 days, plus extra days from the amount of gas Ukraine itself could produce before the exhaustion of existing reserves).|$|E

The new constitution of 1886 established the Republic of Colombia as a unitary state, with departments were distinctly subordinate to the central government. Panama was singled out as subject to the direct authority of the government. The United States consul general reported that three-quarters of the Panamanians wanted independence from Colombia and would revolt {{if they could get}} arms and be sure of freedom from United States intervention.|$|E

50|$|Nevertheless, Colombia {{continued}} to express interest in {{negotiating with the}} United States on building a canal. A treaty was signed in 1846 between the two countries. The treaty removed the existing restrictive tariffs and gave the United States and its citizens the right of free transit of persons and goods over any road or canal that might be constructed in the isthmus. In addition, the United States guaranteed the neutrality of the isthmus and Colombia's sovereignty over it, {{with a view to}} ensuring <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>transit</b> {{for the duration of the}} treaty, which was to be twenty years or as long thereafter as the parties gave no notice to revise it. Called the Mallarino-Bidlack Treaty of 1846, it was actually ratified and became effective in 1848.|$|E
