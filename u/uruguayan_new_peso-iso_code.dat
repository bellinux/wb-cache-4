40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the {{willingness}} to justify illegal actions (or permissiveness) in the case of <b>Uruguayans.</b> We introduce <b>new</b> factors within the analysis: whether this attitude has changed between 1996 and 2006. In line with previous findings, some sociodemographic variables (age, education, beliefs in God, and patriotism) reduce the probability of being permissive. We also add new elements to the discussion and present some particularities of the Uruguayan case: the role of political affiliation depends on the ideological ground of the elected political party, permissiveness has dramatically changed and it is much higher in 2006...|$|R

Although usually labelled a punk band, the dark tone and minimalist music of Los Estómagos mean they are closer to new wave bands such as Bauhaus and Joy Division, rather than Sex Pistols.

40|$|The <b>Uruguayan</b> and <b>New</b> Zealand beef {{industries}} have developed under similar climatic conditions that favour pastoral farming. Both industries are export focused. However, the development paths {{taken by the}} two {{industries have}} been different. Porter’s diamond {{is used as a}} framework for analysing the competitive strengths and weaknesses of each industry. It is concluded that the lower prices received by producers in the Uruguayan industry, linked historically to Uruguay’s foot and mouth disease (FMD) status but now caused primarily by tariff issues in the North American market, have been a fundamental problem. This has led to different input-output ratios than have been experienced in New Zealand, and made investment based on intensification less attractive. The New Zealand industry has also benefited from deregulation, such that investors have been more willing to invest in the knowledge that their competitive position will be determined by market forces rather than by government behaviour. The key to the future prospects of the Uruguayan industry is by addressing the market access problems and the provision of a deregulated agribusiness environment. The challenge for the New Zealand industry is how to maintain and enhance its current position as other countries seek to copy and surpass its performance...|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately for the player, {{the team}} {{underwent}} many {{changes at the}} conclusion of the 2010-11 Serie A campaign, and after such an injury-plagued season, Martínez was seemingly not part of the club's future plans under newly appointed coach, Antonio Conte. Despite remaining with the first team throughout the 2011-12 Serie A pre-season and taking part in multiple pre-season friendlies, it was confirmed on 29 August 2011that Martínez would spend the 2011-12 Serie A season on a season-long loan deal with A.C. Cesena in an attempt for the player to regain full fitness and form over the course of the campaign.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} Uruguayan long-run economic evolution it becomes crucial to interpret its export performance during the First Globalization. The lack of accuracy of official figures, especially official prices used, calls for an adjustment of Uruguayan exports series. We have used empirical evidence to test the accuracy of quantities and values of exports' records, first, according to import partners' records and, second, according to international market prices. Results show a general undervaluation of official export values during the period along with severe distortions in the registers caused by transit trade. We reconstructed <b>new</b> <b>Uruguayan</b> export f. o. b values and export price index, which present an export evolution more unstable and less dynamic than the one showed by its neighbor Argentina.

40|$|El Baño del Papa {{provides}} {{a discussion of}} the degree to which the international arena is currently influencing the aesthetic of the emergent <b>new</b> <b>Uruguayan</b> cinema. El Baño del Papa appeals to both national and international audiences by constructing a realist film about poverty that is accessible to overseas audiences (its Bicycle Thieves aspect) and at the same time a story that is specific to contemporary Uruguayan audiences – the tale of a family struggling to earn a living on Uruguay’s borders (its ‘Thieves on Bicycles’ aspect). Thus El Baño del Papa appeals to international festival audiences by re-affirming previous preconceptions about Uruguay, and Latin America generally, and yet still attracts local audiences who recognise a recreation of a specific national ‘reality’. However, this is a sophisticated film which also offers the attentive viewer the chance to read its ending (which plays in a melodramatic mode) as a rejection of the very process through which films from peripheral countries can be ‘positioned’ on the world stage by the critical agendas of pre-existing cinematic distribution circuits, like that of the European film festivals...|$|R
5000|$|There was one {{unofficial}} {{chronicler of}} the First International American Conference (Washington, United States, 1890) {{who was not}} only a brilliant writer, but also an astute political observer: the poet, hero and martyr of Cuban Independence, José Martí.

Martí was an extraordinary [...] "bridge" [...] person not only between the major languages of the Hemisphere, but also across the wide cultural gap between the Anglo-Saxon and the Latin personalities and ways of being.As <b>Uruguayan</b> consul in <b>New</b> York, Martí had diplomatic status and entre to several delegations.

40|$|According to Porter (1990), {{there are}} certain {{characteristics}} {{of a country that}} allow its industries to create and sustain competitive advantage, or prevent them from doing so. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify and compare the sources of competitive advantage or disadvantage for the <b>Uruguayan</b> and <b>New</b> Zealand beef industries. To accomplish these objectives, Porter’s Diamond Framework was selected as the theoretical framework to assess the competitive advantage of nations. Two case studies “the Beef Industry in Uruguay” and “the Beef Industry in New Zealand” were carried out. The information was obtained from secondary sources and open-ended interviews to key informants in both countries. Uruguay and New Zealand possess observable similarities, such as size, population, similar farmland area, and an economy based on agriculture with low levels of subsidies and trade regulations. In addition, the industries in both countries target the international market. Considering beef production, these countries produce beef based on pastures; hence, they have similar seasonal fluctuations in slaughter and in the product offered into the market. These similarities make these countries interesting to compare. On the other hand, Uruguay and New Zealand have differences. They are in different stages of economic development, and have cultural, sociological and educational differences. The beef industry is the most important economic activity in Uruguay, as can be illustrated by the resources allocated in this sector and in the volume and value of exported beef. In New Zealand, the beef industry is less important; however, it constitutes an excellent complementary activity for sheep and dairy productions. Both beef industries also have differences in their levels of productivity, stock compositions, stock categories, age of slaughtered animals, sanitary status, and locations in relation to markets. This suggests different sources of competitive advantage. The results show that the Uruguayan beef industry has a weaker diamond than its New Zealand counterpart does. However, the industry in Uruguay has been increasing the use of resources in comparison to other pastoral activities such as dairy and sheep. In contrast, the New Zealand beef industry, despite having a stronger diamond than the Uruguayan beef industry, has a secondary role behind the sheep and dairy industry. There are two clear limitations for the Uruguayan beef industry. First, the performance of the primary sector is poor. Second, the Uruguayan exported beef receives a lower price than the New Zealand product, and has difficulties for gaining access to certain markets. These two characteristics were identified as the most dissimilar for both industries. The selected research design and theoretical framework were adequate to accomplish the objectives. Although most of Porter’s findings were not supported in this study, using the framework allowed the development of an exhaustive analysis of the possible factors affecting the sources of competitive advantage in both industries. Comparing diamonds in different countries has not been done before; therefore, this research provides empirical evidence of the advantages and disadvantages of using this framework for international comparisons. Finally, the information presented in this research did not intend to suggest possible strategies or policies to increase the competitiveness of both industries. However, the results are likely to provide useful information for further studies in these industries...|$|R
