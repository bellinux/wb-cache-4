5000|$|Further {{complications}} {{came when}} {{a section of}} the French Army rebelled and openly backed the [...] "" [...] movement to defeat separation. Revolts and riots broke out in 1958 against the French government in Algiers, but there were no adequate and competent political initiatives by the French government in support of military efforts to end the rebellion owing to party politics. The feeling was widespread that another debacle like that of Indochina in 1954 was in the offing and that the government would order another precipitous pullout and sacrifice French honor to political expediency. This prompted General [...] to create a French settlers' committee to demand the formation of a new national government under General , who was a national hero and had advocated a strong military policy, nationalism and the retention of French control over Algeria.

40|$|AbstractThe {{essential}} requirements for enzyme assays are described and frequently occurring errors and pitfalls {{as well as}} their avoidance are discussed. The main factors, which must be considered for assaying enzymes, are temperature, pH, ionic strength and the proper concentrations of the essential components like substrates and enzymes. Standardization of these parameters would be desirable, but the diversity of the features of different enzymes prevents unification of assay conditions. Nevertheless, many enzymes, especially those from mammalian sources, possess a pH optimum near the physiological pH of 7. 5, and the body temperature of about 37 °C can serve as assay temperature, although because of experimental reasons frequently 25 °C is preferred. But in many cases the particular features of the individual enzyme dictate special assay conditions, which can deviate considerably from recommended conditions. In addition, exact values for the concentrations of assay components such as substrates and enzymes cannot be given, <b>unless</b> <b>general</b> rules depending on the relative degree of saturation can be stated. Rules for performing the enzyme assay, appropriate handling, methodical aspects, preparation of assay mixtures and blanks, choice of the assay time, are discussed and suggestions to avoid frequent and trivial errors are given. Particularities of more complex enzyme assays, including reversible reactions and coupled tests are considered. Finally the treatment of experimental data to estimate the enzyme activity is described. The procedure for determining the initial enzyme velocity and its transformation into defined enzyme units as well as suggestions for documentation of the results are presented...|$|E
