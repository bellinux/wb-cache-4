For column <b>User</b> Identity, 0 represents the <b>user</b> is normal <b>user</b> while any number larger than 0 means the <b>user</b> is a crawler. Wrong Heuristic Logs records the number of requests that are abnormal for a <b>user</b> regarding to the heuristic detection. It resets to 0 at 12 am each day. If any <b>user</b> has more than 30 wrong logs, then our system sets its <b>User</b> Identity as 4. Thus, the server script knows this <b>user</b> is suspicious. <b>User</b> Total Pending Logs records the number of logs that one <b>user</b> has generated after last long session. If this column equals to 60, we know this <b>user</b> has generated a new long session and we should inspect this long session. <b>User</b> CAPTCHA Times records how many times the <b>user</b> has been checked by CAPTCHA. It resets to 0 at 12 am each day.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The A {{theory of}} <b>user</b> {{expectation}} of system interaction is {{introduced in the}} context of <b>User</b> Adapted Interfaces.

The results supported our hypothesis that <b>user</b> control over adaptation is preferred because the <b>user</b> can maintain the system’s interaction state within a region of <b>user</b> expectation. This remains true even when performance of the system (accuracy of spam filtering) degrades because of errors in <b>user</b> control (adjustment of spam cut-offs). ...|$|R
