40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{the activities of}} the four-week whole body dissection course the main authors partecipated in August 2016 at the dissection hall of the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Malta</b> (<b>UoM).</b> Our team comprised 10 second-year medicine students from University of Palermo chosen among who had passed the Human Anatomy exam brilliantly. The need to molve to the UoM to take part in such activity derives from the lack of practice approach in Italian schools of medicine, focused mostly on the theoretical studies, neglecting practical experience. The heart dissection reveal itself as a huge opportunity to finally apply our anatomical knowledge, improving it and enabling us to compare image took from books to the actual organ. We had the chance to handle a real heart, to appreciate its weight and consistence. We took part in coronary artery courses focusing on their functions within the heart machinery...|$|E
40|$|The higher {{education}} sector in Malta has witnessed {{a sharp increase in}} enrolments in the past 20 years. This could inter alia be attributed to policy changes aimed at increasing the participation rate at {{higher education}}. However, this and the current economic downturn have made funding more challenging. The <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Malta</b> (<b>UoM)</b> operations are mainly funded through grants on recurrent and capital expenditure issued yearly by the Government of Malta. This paper outlines the current funding structure of the UoM and relate this to student numbers over the years so as to determine whether the UoM has experienced a decline or otherwise in funds per student. The paper also analyses the financial impact of achieving a target participation rate of 35 per cent by 2020 in tertiary education including the effect of the projected increase in student numbers on stipends awarded to full-time University students.

The study was performed on two corpses, a male and a female, by using a basic surgeon kit. Blunt dissection method was used for fasciae, innards and to isolate vascular-nervous structures from the fat; we used scalpel for cutis, sub cutis, muscles and tendons. We compared the anatomy figured by books and cadaver’s anatomy. We separated muscles, fasciae, veins, arteries and nerves of the upper limb from the shoulder to the hand. The upper limb dissection shows the difference between how a real body appears and how books represent it...|$|E

40|$|Personal and Social Development (PSD) is a {{statutory}} {{subject in}} Maltese schools. Whilst PSD {{does not exist}} as a subject in Maltese higher education, PSD practice is present within the academic content {{as well as the}} co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. Its’ claimed purpose is to support the students’ personal and social development. This study explores stakeholder perceptions of PSD practice in Malta, {{the way in which it}} is included within the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Malta</b> (<b>UoM)</b> undergraduate experience and its contribution to the holistic development of undergraduates. Findings indicate that a number of factors impact upon the need, and resulting provision of PSD practice in Malta. These include: smallness of the Maltese Islands; their lack of natural resources and Malta’s reliance on human capabilities. While these factors may generate the need for PSD practice in Malta, other factors, like the traditional academic oriented system and the sense of fear for change, tend to hinder its provision. On the other hand, PSD practice in Malta is facilitated through policies which promote it; the compulsory PSD subject in schools and the different opportunities for PSD practice. In general, UoM students from the Science and Social Sciences faculty clusters, those attending the Degree Plus programme and those participating in extra-curricular groups, ranked highly the provision of generic competences training, the emphasis on their active role and the holistic aims. The thesis suggests that PSD practice at the UoM is not consistent across faculties, but whenever there was PSD practice, students appeared to value it and recognise its contribution to their holistic development. Such link is hindered by factors like the traditional pre-tertiary education, the influence of the European Union with the economic agenda and a neo-liberal, globalized and capitalist society that glorifies competition, performativity and market demands. In conclusion, it is recommended that there is genuine movement towards PSD practice for holistic aims...|$|E
