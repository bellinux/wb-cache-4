40|$|This paper proposes {{an option}} for the concessionaires to prematurely {{terminate}} the contracts {{as an alternative to}} existing government supports for public-corporate partnered infrastructure projects implemented under the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) scheme. This instrument is well adapted to BOT projects <b>under</b> <b>high</b> <b>risks</b> which are neither controllable nor predictable with certainty by contracting parties, such as demand uncertainties in retail infrastructure. It shares some element of support by way of reducing demand risks and, given the high degree of asset specificity, providing concessionaires with limited flexibilities on their stay-or-exit decisions when the projects turn out be financially infeasible. Another advantage of adopting this instrument is that the government contingent liability is straightforwardly measured, thus allowing {{for the establishment of a}} better budget at risk. Tested on a hypothetical BOT toll road project and using Monte Carlo simulation, the option to terminate is proven to be useful for making the project under evaluation more attractive although the extent to which it improves the viability largely depends on the project riskiness: the higher uncertainty increases the value of this option.

40|$|Computational {{modelling}} of the screw-bone interface in fracture fixation constructs is challenging. While incorporating {{screw threads}} {{would be a}} more realistic representation of the physics, this approach can be computationally expensive. Several studies have instead suppressed the threads and modelled the screw shaft with fixed conditions assumed at the screw-bone interface. This study assessed the sensitivity of the computational results to modelling approaches at the screw-bone interface. A new approach for modelling this interface was proposed, and it was tested on two locking screw designs in a diaphyseal bridge plating configuration. Computational models of locked plating and far cortical locking constructs were generated and compared to in vitro models described in prior literature to corroborate the outcomes. The new approach led to closer agreement between the computational and the experimental stiffness data, while the fixed approach led to overestimation of the stiffness predictions. Using the new approach, the pattern of load distribution and the magnitude of the axial forces, experienced by each screw, were compared between the locked plating and far cortical locking constructs. The computational models suggested that under more severe loading conditions, far cortical locking screws might be <b>under</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of screw pull-out than the locking screws.

Systematic review was performed using PUBMED and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Original and review papers that relate to teratogenic effects of antiepileptic drugs were included in the analysis. Fourteen studies were found, out of which there were 7 original papers and 7 review papers. The lowest number of participants in a study was 54 and the highest 3607. Studies followed participants from 5 to 9 years. Antiepileptic drugs were used as monotherapy in 2 studies, while other studies examined both mono- and polytherapy. Doses administered varied from 600 mg (carbamazepine), 100 - 200 mg (lamotrigine) and 600 - 1000 mg (valproate), depending on kind of administration (mono or polytherapy). Among all examined antiepileptic drugs, valproate has shown the highest relation to occurrence of any degree of mental retardation or congenital malformation. Risk of congenital malformations was correlated with administration of higher drug doses and the use of polytherapy. Carbamazepine was shown to be the safest drug to use during pregnancy.

Insular populations are exposed to <b>high</b> <b>risks</b> of extinction because restricted habitats ofte n amplify the impact of stochastic events or human - induced effects.

Although this is considered a postulate of island biogeography, empirical tests on a diverse animal group over an entire archipelago {{have not yet been}} done. Here we analysed the data of 15 years of research on the butterflies of the Tuscan Archipelago. The combined eff ort made by academic units, public institutions, amateur entomologists and citizens have allowed us to i) carry out an extensive DNA barcoding assessment of the entire butterfly fauna including a comparison with populations from Sardinia, Corsica, and Tusc any, ii) identify which species recorded in the past experienced extinction or a dramatic decline, and iii) identify which functional traits (morphological, phenological, trophic and climatic preferences) are correlated with genetic structure, haplotype un iqueness and negative population trends.
