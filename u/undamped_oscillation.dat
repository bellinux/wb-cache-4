Both factors are important in the development process. The authors consider a neoclassical growth model with rural-urban migration and urban underemployment, which arises from an adverse selection problem in labor markets. They demonstrate that rural-urban migration and underemployment can be a source of development traps and can give rise to a large set of periodic equilibria displaying <b>undamped</b> <b>oscillation.</b> Many such equilibria display long periods of uninterrupted growth, punctuated by brief but severe recessions.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{effect of}} amplification due to cooling and damping due to resonant absorption on the kink oscillations of coronal loops is studied. The governing equation describing the kink oscillations is derived {{in the thin}} tube thin boundary layer approximation. The cooling time {{is assumed to be}} much larger than the oscillation period, and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method is used to obtain the equation describing the dependence of the oscillation amplitude on time. This equation is solved numerically for various values of determining parameters. In particular, the question if the amplification due to cooling can balance the resonant damping and produce <b>undamped</b> <b>oscillation</b> is addressed. The conclusion is that the amplification due to cooling is not very efficient and can balance the resonant damping only when the density contrast is not very large and the cooling is very fast with the characteristic cooling time of the order of the oscillation period...|$|E

The exception is provided by a small class of combinations operators and boundary conditions for which the displacement converges to an <b>undamped</b> <b>oscillation.</b> For several application it is importat to know how fast the solution goes to zero, if there exist a rate of decay. Unfortunately in thermoelasticity, even in the best case of the convergence to zero occurs, it can be arbitrarily slow.

40|$|Flames {{near the}} rich-flammability limit of hydrogen-air {{mixtures}} are studied using a detailed, time-dependent, one-dimensional Lagrangian model. Results from the numerical simulations {{indicate that a}} steady burning velocity is not obtained for very rich hydrogen-air mixtures. As the amount of hydrogen is increased, a damped oscillation is observed in the flame and burning velocities, and then, with further increase {{in the amount of}} hydrogen, an <b>undamped</b> <b>oscillation</b> with a complex set of frequencies is observed. Simulations with a simplified one-step irreversible chemical reaction do not show these oscillations, suggesting that chemical kinetics plays a strong role in inducing these oscillations. Further analysis shows that the oscillations are due to a competition for H atoms between chain branching and chain-terminating reactions. Simulations of spherically expanding flames suggest that stretch effects (due to curvature) will cause the oscillations to occur in less rich mixtures than that observed for planar flames. The implications of these oscillations on the rich-flammability limit as well as the role of chemical kinetics in creating a fundamental flammability limit is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{development}} is typically {{accompanied by a}} very pronounced migration of labor from rural to urban employment. This migration, in turn, {{is often associated with}} large scale urban underemployment. Both factors appear to play a very prominent role in the process of development. We consider a model in which rural-urban migration and urban underemployment are integrated into an otherwise conventional neoclassical growth model. Unemployment arises not from any exogenous rigidities, but from an adverse selection problem in labor markets. We demonstrate that, in the most natural case, rural-urban migration - and its associated underemployment - can be a source of multiple, asymptotically stable steady state equilibria, and hence of development traps. They also easily give rise to an indeterminacy of perfect foresight equilibrium, {{as well as to the}} existence of a large set of periodic equilibria displaying <b>undamped</b> <b>oscillation.</b> Many such equilibria display long periods of uninterrupted growth and rural-urban migration, punctuated by brief but severe recessions associated with net migration from urban to rural employment.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve the optimal design based on some {{specific}} criteria by applying conventional techniques, sequence of design, selected locations of PSSs are critical involved factors. This paper presents a method to simultaneously tune PSSs in multimachine power system using hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA) and parallel micro genetic algorithm (parallel micro-GA) based on multiobjective function comprising the damping ratio, damping factor and number of PSSs. First, the problem of selecting proper PSS parameters is converted to a simple multiobjective optimization problem. Then, the problem is solved by a parallel micro GA based on HGA. The stabilizers are tuned to simultaneously shift the lightly damped and <b>undamped</b> <b>oscillation</b> modes to a specific stable zone in the s-plane and to self identify the appropriate choice of PSS locations by using eigenvalue-based multiobjective function.

40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} {{proposal}} that one can obtain quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) by photon echoes manifesting as non-trivial features in the autocorrelation function (ACF), we study the ACFs of the light curves of three accreting black hole candidates and a neutron star already known to exhibit QPOs namely, GRS 1915 + 105, XTE J 1550 - 564, XTE J 1859 + 226 and Cygnus X- 2. We compute {{and focus on the}} form of the ACFs in search of systematics or specific temporal properties at the time scales associated with the known QPO frequencies in comparison with the corresponding PDS. Even within our small object sample we find both similarities as well as significant and subtle differences {{in the form of the}} ACFs both amongst black holes and between black holes and neutron stars to warrant a closer look at the QPO phenomenon in the time domain: The QPO features manifest as an oscillatory behavior of the ACF at lags near zero; the oscillation damps exponentially on time scales equal to the inverse QPO width to a level of a percent or so. In black holes this oscillatory behavior is preserved and easily discerned at much longer lags while this is not the case for the neutron star system Cyg X- 2. The ACF of GRS 1915 + 105 provides an exception to this general behavior in that its decay is linear in time indicating an <b>undamped</b> <b>oscillation</b> of coherent phase. We present simple ad hoc models that reproduce these diverse time domain behaviors and we speculate that their origin is the phase coherence of the underlying oscillation. It appears plausible that time domain analyses, complementary to the more common frequency domain ones, could impose tighter constraints and provide clues for the driving mechanisms behind the QPO phenomenon.
