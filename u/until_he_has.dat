5|$|The proper METHOD for {{studying}} poetry and good letters is {{the method of}} contemporary biologists, that is careful first-hand examination of the matter, and continual COMPARISON of one 'slide' or specimen with another. No man is equipped for modern thinking <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> understood the anecdote of Agassiz and the sunfish.|$|E
5|$|The film {{tells the}} story of Mahesh Bhavana (Faasil), a photographer, who {{attempts}} to defuse a conflict between his friend Crispin (Shahir) and a group of youngsters passing through their village, and is knocked to the ground. Defeated in the tussle and unable to fight back, he is embarrassed in front of his neighbours. Mahesh publicly vows that he will not wear his slippers again <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> avenged the humiliation.|$|E

5|$|She later takes {{a romantic}} {{interest}} in Xavier {{and they have}} a brief fling <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to leave because of drug couriering. He later returns and she opts to resume their relationship, but his ex-girlfriend Freya Duric (Sophie Hensser) ruins things. She makes him sell illegal drugs again and Xavier is torn between her and Ruby. He later decides to settle down with Ruby much to her delight after Ruby exposes Freya and pays her to leave. When Xavier's brother Brendan (Kain O'Keeffe) arrives, he pushes Ruby away because he has learning difficulties, he feels they will act strangely. Ruby later bonds with Brendan; Xavier is pleased and they resume their relationship.|$|E
5|$|The Adventure of Link has a {{more complex}} combat system than its predecessor. Armed with a sword and shield, Link must {{alternate}} between standing and crouching positions in order to attack enemies and defend himself; for example, the Iron Knuckle enemy changes the height of its attack and its shield depending on Link's current stance, forcing Link to change stances <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a chance to attack safely. Link {{has the ability to}} jump, which can be used for attacking tall or airborne enemies, and can be used for evasion. Eventually, he can learn techniques for downward and upward stabs in midair.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} {{employed}} as caretakers at Mr. Burns' mansion. Mr. Burns cuts the cable television wire and steals the beer, thinking this will ensure hard {{work from the}} family. While there, Groundskeeper Willie discovers that Bart {{has the power to}} read his thoughts and says that if Homer goes insane, he should use this to call him. The deprivation of his two favorite things causes Homer to go insane and a ghostly Moe informs Homer he must kill his family {{in order to get a}} beer. Marge confronts Homer and locks him in the pantry <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> calmed down.|$|E

5|$|Larger rodents tend to live {{in family}} units where parents and their {{offspring}} live together until the young disperse. Beavers live in extended family units typically {{with a pair of}} adults, this year's kits, the previous year's offspring, and sometimes older young. Brown rats usually live in small colonies with up to six females sharing a burrow and one male defending a territory around the burrow. At high population densities, this system breaks down and males show a hierarchical system of dominance with overlapping ranges. Female offspring remain in the colony while male young disperse. The prairie vole is monogamous and forms a lifelong pair bond. Outside the breeding season, prairie voles live in close proximity with others in small colonies. A male is not aggressive towards other males <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> mated, after which time he defends a territory, a female, and a nest against other males. The pair huddles together, grooms one another, and shares nesting and pup-raising responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2010, the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) and ESPN the Magazine {{selected}} their Academic All-Americans {{from throughout}} college basketball. CoSIDA has selected Academic All American teams since 1952. To be nominated, a student-athlete {{must be a}} starter or important reserve {{with at least a}} 3.30 cumulative grade point average (on a 4.0 scale) at his/her current institution. Nominated athletes must have participated in at least 50 percent of the team’s games at the position listed on the nomination form (where applicable). No student-athlete is eligible <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> completed one full calendar year at his current institution and has reached sophomore athletic eligibility. In the cases of transfers, graduate students and two-year college graduates, the student-athlete must have completed one full calendar year at the nominating institution to be eligible. Nominees in graduate school must have a cumulative GPA of 3.30 or better both as an undergrad and in grad school. Michigan's Zack Novak was a District 4 first-team 2009 Academic All-District Men’s Basketball Team selection and Purdue's E'Twaun Moore was a District 5 selection, making them 2 of the 40 finalists for the 15-man Academic All-American team. On February 22, Moore was selected as a second-team Academic All-American.|$|E
5|$|Once in Nightopia, they {{discover}} and release Nights, who tells them about dreams and Wizeman and his plans; the three begin {{a journey to}} stop Wizeman and restore peace to Nightopia. When they defeat Wizeman and Reala, peace is returned to Nightopia {{and the world of}} Nightmare is suppressed. The next day, back in Twin Seeds, a centenary ceremony begins. Elliot is seen walking through the parade <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a vision of Nights looking at him through a billboard. Realizing that Claris is performing in a hall, Elliot runs through the crowd and sees Claris on stage in front of a large audience, singing well. The two look at each other, and are transitioned to a spring valley in Nightopia, which leaves ambiguity as to whether what they achieved was real or just a dream.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Boulier, a surly {{accountant}} for Éditions Dupuis, {{the publishers}} of the magazine. He {{states that he}} will not rest <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> tracked down every useless expense in the company, and in particular those of Gaston. However, his attempts to cause Gaston grief backfire in spectacular ways. He represents the more serious side of the comics publishing business.|$|E

25|$|The grand {{marriage}} {{is a symbol of}} social status on the Comoros islands. The completion of an ada marriage also greatly increases a man’s standing in the Comoran hierarchy. A Comoran man can only wear certain elements of the national dress or stand in the first line at the mosque if he has had a grand marriage. Also, one is not fully considered a man <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> had an ada marriage.|$|E
25|$|According to this method, printed {{language}} and text {{must be kept}} away from second language learners {{for as long as}} possible, just as a first language learner does not use printed words <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> good grasp of speech. Learning of writing and spelling should be delayed until after the printed word has been introduced, and grammar and translation should also be avoided because this would involve the application of the learner's first language. All above items must be avoided because they hinder the acquisition of a good oral proficiency.|$|E

25|$|Maurice Hankey {{recorded}} {{that on a}} prewar committee which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> chaired Robertson, then Director of Military Training, had sat rudely {{with his}} back turned to him, <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> flattered him by seeking his advice privately. He wrote that “Perhaps his greatest quality … was “character”. His was a dominating personality … (<b>until)</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to give place to a more nimble and versatile mind (i.e. Wilson)”.|$|R
25|$|Property {{inherited}} by an insolvent {{during his}} insolvency falls into his insolvent estate, notwithstanding a contrary {{provision in the}} testator’s will. However, if an insolvent refuses to accept property bequeathed to him or an insurance benefit of {{which he has been}} nominated as a beneficiary, the property or benefit in question does not vest in his estate. The reason is that the insolvent merely has a competence or power to accept the bequest or nomination, and he acquires no right to the property or benefit <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> accepted. An insolvent may, thus, by repudiating a legacy, inheritance or insurance benefit, ensure that it passes to someone other than the trustee and the creditors of his insolvent estate.|$|E
25|$|Wolfe {{maintains}} a rigid schedule in the brownstone. He has breakfast {{in his bedroom}} while wearing yellow silk pajamas; he hates to discuss work during breakfast, and if forced to do so insists upon not uttering a word <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> finished his {{glass of orange juice}} (Murder by the Book). Afterwards, he is with Horstmann in the plant rooms from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Lunch is usually at 1:15p.m. He returns to the plant rooms from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Dinner is generally at 7:15 or 7:30p.m. (although in one book, Wolfe tells a guest that lunch is served at 1 o'clock and dinner at 8). The remaining hours, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., and after dinner, are available for business, or for reading if there is no pressing business (even if, by Archie's lights, there is). Sunday's schedule is more relaxed; Theodore, the orchid-keeper, usually goes out.|$|E
25|$|While visiting Haafdan {{the group}} also {{encounters}} Gudrid, Leif's former sister-in-law, who is {{to be married to}} Haafdan's son Sigurd. Gudrid has no wish to marry Sigurd however, as she dreams of traveling the world as a sailor like Leif has done. Nonetheless she feels she {{has no choice but to}} obey her family's wishes to remain on Iceland and marry Sigurd. However, during their wedding night Gudrid losers her composure and ends up stabbing Sigurd in his thigh. When Sigurd strikes her in return, she panics and flees. Gudrid sneaks away to Thorfinn's group who is about to set sail for Greece, hoping to make a fortune by trading Narwhal horns. Gudrid informs them of what had happened and breaks down in despair over not being able to live the life she wants because she was born a woman. Thorfinn takes pity on Gudrid and offers her to go with them, but makes it clear that she might never return alive. Gudrid eventually agrees and the group quickly leaves Iceland. Haafdan quickly learns that Gudrid fled with Thorfinn, so Sigurd vows to chase them down and not set foot in his home <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> brought Gudrid back.|$|E
