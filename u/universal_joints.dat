The main frames were bolted onto the power plant in its top quarter. In turn, the frames were attached to the firewall by <b>universal</b> <b>joints.</b> The firewall itself was constructed from asbestos mesh with dural sheets on both sides. All conduits passing through had to be arranged so that no harmful gases could penetrate the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|Citroën had {{developed}} expertise with front-wheel drive {{due to the}} pioneering Traction Avant, {{which was the first}} mass-produced steel monocoque front-wheel-drive car in the world. The 2CV was originally equipped with a sliding splined joint, and twin Hookes type <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> on its driveshafts; later models used constant velocity joints and a sliding splined joint.|$|E
25|$|After factory tests proved promising, {{military}} {{acceptance trials}} commenced on 19 October 1916 {{and led to}} the aircraft being purchased for the Luftstreitkräfte. Soon thereafter trouble set in, with crankshafts repeatedly failing. This was attributed mostly to the engine design, but new engine mountings and <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> for each end of the drive shafts were fitted to mitigate the problem, along with extended wings and other improvements.|$|E

Also available are short <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> extensions that allow any socket to be attached to a ratchet at with a <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> between the two.

500|$|The wing was {{the most}} unusual feature. It {{consisted}} of a single center section and two outer sections installed using four <b>universal</b> <b>joints.</b> The center section had a large negative dihedral (anhedral) and the outer surfaces a positive dihedral. This created the inverted gull, or [...] "cranked", wing pattern along the Ju 87's leading edge. The shape of the wing improved the pilot's ground visibility and also allowed a shorter undercarriage height. The center section protruded by only [...] on either side.|$|E
500|$|One of Heinkel's rivals, Junkers, built 40 He 111Ps at Dessau. In October 1938, the Junkers Central Administration commented:Apparent are the {{externally}} poor, less carefully designed components {{at various}} locations, {{especially at the}} junction between the empennage and the rear fuselage. All parts have an impression of being very weak.... The visible flexing in the wing must also be very high. The left and right powerplants are interchangeable. Each motor has an exhaust-gas heater on one side, {{but it is not}} connected to the fuselage since it is probable that ... the warm air in the fuselage is not free of carbon monoxide (CO). The fuselage is not subdivided into individual segments, but is attached over its entire length, after completion, to the wing centre section. Outboard of the powerplants, the wings are attached by <b>universal</b> <b>joints.</b> The latter can in no way be satisfactory and have been the cause of several failures.|$|E

The objective of this research was to test the real life span of <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> shafts in the laboratory and in field, to obtain the results which can be used to improve the reliability of <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> shafts. If the presented research were used along with maintenance measures recommended in the paper and with proper use, the level of reliability of the shafts would be 2. 1 times higher. The presented results of the research showed that needle bearings, i. e. bearing assemblies of the joints, are the most critical elements on <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> shafts and are possible causes of their lower reliability. The second <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> is the part with the lowest reliability in the observed technical system. ...|$|R

2500|$|The AMC Eagle was {{the first}} {{production}} car to use the complete [...] "Ferguson Formula" [...] (FF) full-time all-wheel-drive system from Britain's Ferguson Research. Other four-wheel-drive automobile-type vehicles - the Subaru DL/GL (1972 for the Japanese domestic market {{and two years later}} in the U.S.), and much later the Toyota Tercel SR5 Wagon (1983) - only had part-time four-wheel-drive systems that could not be engaged on dry pavement. The Eagle was also years ahead of Subaru's simplistic, part-time front-drive/4WD system, due to Roy Lunn's creativity and Jeep's experience producing 4WD vehicles. Another feature was the Eagle's independent front suspension, accomplished by mounting the front differential to the engine block with <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> and half shafts to drive the front wheels.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, [...] "Expert Series" [...] {{sets were}} introduced, geared towards older, more {{experienced}} Lego builders {{followed by the}} [...] "Expert Builder" [...] sets in 1977. The technical sets featured moving parts such as gears, differentials, cogs, levers, axles and <b>universal</b> <b>joints,</b> and permitted the construction of realistic models such as automobiles, with functional {{rack and pinion steering}} and lifelike engine movements. In 1978 the Lego [...] "minifigure" [...] was added. These small Lego people have posable arms and legs, and a smile. The figure was used in many varieties of Lego sets, allowing construction of towns populated with the smiling minifigure Lego citizens. Lego also expanded into space with the creation of Lego Space sets with astronaut minifigures, rockets, lunar rovers and spaceships and in medieval territory with the Castle theme.|$|E
2500|$|The first-generation Corvair {{featured}} a rear engine + swing axle design {{similar to that}} of the Renault Dauphine and Volkswagen Beetle [...] a design which eliminates <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> at the wheels and keeps the rear wheels perpendicular to the half-shafts. The design can allow rear tires to undergo large camber angle changes during fast cornering due to side g-forces causing [...] "rebound" [...] camber and decreasing the tread contact with the road surface, leading to a loss of rear wheel grip and oversteer—a dynamically unstable condition where a driver can lose control and spin. [...] The problem is most severe with rear-engine swing axle combinations because of the greater inertial mass over the rear wheels and the higher center of gravity during rebound camber conditions. [...] The additional high weight of a station wagon body also exacerbates the tendency. [...] Oversteer is exacerbated by deceleration during cornering due to increased side g-force and lightened load on rear tires (lift-off oversteer). Understeer is common in front-engine cars, due to more weight, and inertia, on the front tires. Both conditions are dangerous when a car is driven at its cornering limits.|$|E

Several manipulators are used to demonstrate the solution methods: cartesian, cylindrical, spherical, and an anthropomorphic articulated arm, based on the Flight Telerobotic Servicer (FTS) arm. A singularity analysis is presented for the double <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> wrist attached to the above manipulator arms. While the double <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> wrist standing alone is singularity-free in orientation, the singularity analysis indicates the presence of coupled position/orientation singularities of the spherical and articulated manipulators with the wrist.

The methods of this paper can be implemented in a real-time controller for manipulators with the double <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> wrist.
