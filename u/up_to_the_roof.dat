5|$|On February 28, 1332, a fire {{broke out}} in the palace of the podestà, the leading {{magistrate}} of the city. This fire destroyed the roof of the palace and destroyed two-thirds of the entire structure from the ground floor up, prompting the government to rebuild the palatial residence totally out of stone, all the way <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> On July 16 of that year the palace of the wool guild caught fire and everything from the ground floor up was destroyed, prompting the wool guild to reconstruct a new palatial residence on a larger scale and with stone vaults leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arriving at the capitol, I {{sprang from}} my horse, first unbuckling {{the stars and}} stripes, a large flag I had {{on the front of}} my saddle.

5|$|Lazzell {{turned her}} old fish shack into a {{personal}} space and built large flower boxes around her studio, allowing morning glory and Madeira vines to grow <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> Her studio's garden became a local attraction and she hosted teas {{for which she}} made homemade candy. During this time Lazzell produced white-line prints and flower monoprints and she taught painting and block printing classes.|$|E

60|$|Twenty {{minutes after}} the first volley the great fleet swung {{trailing}} {{off in the direction}} from which it had first appeared. Several of the craft were limping perceptibly, and seemed but barely under the control of their depleted crews. Their fire had ceased entirely and all their energies seemed focused upon escape. Our warriors then rushed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of <b>the</b> buildings which we occupied and followed the retreating armada with a continuous fusillade of deadly fire.|$|R
5|$|Together, the Clan cats {{succeed in}} leading Sharptooth {{into a trap}} in a cave. However, their plan to poison Sharptooth goes awry, and Feathertail jumps <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the cave onto a stalactite, causing it to fall. Both Feathertail and Sharptooth are killed by the impact. The Tribe then realizes that Feathertail was the silver cat in their prophecy, not her brother Stormfur, as they had {{previously}} thought. The five remaining cats then continue their journey. The book ends with Squirrelpaw noticing Highstones, {{which is at the}} edge of WindClan territory; they are almost home.|$|E
5|$|After {{departing from}} the bus, Peter goes off as Spider-Man to an armored truck, which Sandman is robbing. In their struggle, the truck {{goes out of}} control and lands in a {{construction}} site. When Spider-Man tries to web him up, it proves to be ineffective as Sandman can slip through them; the villain then starts to attack Spider-Man with girders. Meanwhile, at the soda shop, Harry tries to impress the jocks, catching Kenny's girlfriend Glory's attention. Kenny plays a prank on Harry, which enrages Glory and she asks Harry to take her home. Back on the construction site, Spider-Man gets out from the pile of girders and gets the head on Sandman. He lures him <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and encasing him in cement from the nearby cement maker.|$|E
5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{investigate}} the fatal shooting of a man, who was apparently killed for a $1.49 pen. Lewis believes {{there must be}} more to the story, refusing to believe a pen is worth killing for. When they search suspect Mitchell Forman's (Sal S. Koussa) apartment, they find thousands of pens, many of which line the walls like bizarre decorations. Lewis later finds Forman at the police station, where he originally planned to turn himself in, but instead went <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> to commit suicide. Lewis lures Forman away from the ledge by enticing him with a beautiful golden pen, which belonged to Lewis' deceased grandmother. Forman is taken into custody. Later, Lewis still cannot believe someone would kill over a pen, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) suggests it is no worse than killing over a car or woman. Lewis, determined not to develop such a strong attachment to a material item, gives his grandmother's pen to Felton (Daniel Baldwin).|$|E

5|$|The episode finalizes several {{important}} plot strands {{of the second}} season. Together, Keith and Vinnie Van Lowe track down Woody Goodman and arrest him. Veronica imagines graduation if Lilly had not been murdered, and then actually graduates. Jackie reveals her true past to Wallace before leaving him finally. Veronica learns that Beaver {{was responsible for the}} bus crash and gave her chlamydia after he raped her. Beaver explodes the plane with Woody Goodman on it.

5|$|One of {{the best}} {{preserved}} phases of Temple 16 is the Rosalila, built over the remains of five previous versions of the temple. Archaeologist Ricardo Agurcia discovered the almost intact shrine while tunneling underneath {{the final version of}} the temple. Rosalila is notable for its excellent state of preservation, including the entire building from the base platform <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> comb, including its highly elaborate painted stucco decoration. Rosalila features K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' placed at the centre of a mythological tableau, combining the founder of the dynasty with the sky deity Itzamna in avian form. The mythological imagery also includes anthropomorphic mountains, skeletons and crocodiles. Vents in the exterior were designed so smoke from incense being burned inside the shrine would interact with the stucco sculpture of the exterior. The temple had a hieroglyphic stone step with a dedicatory inscription. The stone step is less well preserved than the rest of the building, but a date in AD571 has been deciphered. Due to the deforestation of the Copán valley, the Rosalila building was the last structure at the site to use such elaborate stucco decoration — vast quantities of firewood could no longer be spared to reduce limestone to plaster. A life-size copy of the Rosalila building has been built at the Copán site museum.|$|E

25|$|Starting in the 1980s, the {{perfection}} of the extractor hood allowed an open kitchen again, integrated more or less with the living room without causing the whole apartment or house to smell. Before that, only a few earlier experiments, typically in newly built upper-middle-class family homes, had open kitchens. Examples are Frank Lloyd Wright's House Willey (1934) and House Jacobs (1936). Both had open kitchens, with high ceilings (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof)</b> and were aired by skylights. The extractor hood {{made it possible to}} build open kitchens in apartments, too, where both high ceilings and skylights were not possible.|$|E

MPs and security experts found it worrying that the protesters {{made it to the}} roof in spite of the heightened security measures, and the prosecution at the activists' trial argued that they may have received help from a House of Lords employee. In October 2009, at least forty Greenpeace activists climbed to the roof of Westminster Hall to call for the adoption of policies combating climate change. Some of them climbed down after nearly five hours, while the rest spent the night on the roof.|$|E
25|$|Sidon Sea Castle is a crusader {{castle and}} one of the most {{prominent}} sites in the southern city of Sidon. During the 13th century, the Crusaders built Sidon's Sea Castle as a fortress on a small island connected to the mainland by a narrow 80m long roadway. The island was formerly the site of a temple to Melkart, the Phoenician version of Hercules. The beauty of the Castle can be seen in old illustrations of it; however, after bearing several wars, it has been damaged and renovated several times. It was partially destroyed by the Mamluks when they took over the city from the Crusaders, but they subsequently rebuilt it and added the long causeway. The castle later fell into disuse, but was again restored in the 17th century by Emir Fakhreddine II, only to suffer great damage. Today the castle consists primarily of two towers connected by a wall. In the outer walls, Roman columns were used as horizontal reinforcements, a feature often seen in fortifications built on or near former Roman sites. The rectangular west tower to the left of the entrance is the better preserved of the two. There is a large vaulted room scattered with old carved capitals and rusting cannonballs. A winding staircase leads <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> where there is a small, domed Ottoman-era mosque. From the roof there is a great view across the old city and fishing harbor. The east tower isn't as well preserved and was built in two phases; the lower part dates to the Crusader period, while the upper level was built by the Mamluks. There has also been evidence of the old Phoenician city being buried under the sea in the area surrounding the castle, structures of walls, columns, stairways, remains of buildings, statues and cisterns.|$|E

500|$|At {{the centre}} of the new castle was a {{circular}} keep, with three ovoid towers and bastions around it on the north-west, north-east and south sides, and a gatehouse to the north. These were surrounded by two curtain walls, forming a triangular inner and outer ward. Covered stone passageways, three storeys high, linked the towers, the keep and the gatehouse. The outer ward was grassed over, with a stone cesspool {{by the side of the}} north-east tower, linked by sewers to the inside of the castle. The castle was entered through a doorway in the rear of the gatehouse, originally called the [...] "Half Moon", linked by a stairway in the covered passageway to the keep. There were four tiers of guns in the finished castle, from the ground level <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the keep, and a total of 142 firing points for cannon and handguns; their design closely resembling those at nearby Walmer and Deal castles.|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} contains several geometric constructions. The {{roof of the}} shed's trusses form {{series of}} triangles connecting lines joining {{the base of the}} pedestals and the crossbeams. These surround the gathering of the Holy Family, who form an inverse pattern. According to art historian Lawrence Steefel, [...] "the detail participates in an almost emblematic pattern of repeated triangles which establish a rhyme scheme above and below, of roof structure and figure disposition." [...] Upton writes that a [...] "clearly defined diamond" [...] is visible within the apex in the roof. From there it extends down to Eve, and the bottom apex is formed where the infant lies on the ground. It then extends up to Adam and back <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> [...] "This diamond shape," [...] he writes, [...] "supplemented by the rectangle within it, formed by the shed supports, the base of the triangle and the ground line in the shed, circumscribes the main event of the painting." ...|$|E
