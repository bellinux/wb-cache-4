5|$|However, {{the climate}} and soil are <b>unsuitable</b> for {{large-scale}} irrigation.|$|E
5|$|The War Office also {{considered}} the Tetrarch's cooling system faulty, making the tank <b>unsuitable</b> for service in hotter climates, {{such as the}} Middle East and North Africa.|$|E
5|$|About 73 {{percent of}} Japan is forested, mountainous and <b>unsuitable</b> for agricultural, {{industrial}} or residential use. As a result, the habitable zones, mainly located in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities. Japan {{is one of}} the most densely populated countries in the world.|$|E
5|$|As {{in much of}} the UK, Leeds' {{housing stock}} had fallen into {{disrepair}} {{by the middle of the}} 20th century. The city was overcrowded, and the Victorian terraces were <b>unsuitable</b> for modern inhabitation. Leeds had one of the most Labour orientated councils and in the 1930s pledged to replace 30,000 slums.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914 Pilcher was on leave in England, and offered his services to the War Office, but was initially turned down as <b>unsuitable</b> for command by Sir John French; however, in January 1915 he was appointed to command the newly formed 17th (Northern) Division, a New Army division predominantly drawn from northern England.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{projects}} have several stages of development. Each phase has associated risks. At {{the early stages}} of reconnaissance and geophysical surveys, many projects are cancelled, making that phase <b>unsuitable</b> for traditional lending. Projects moving forward from the identification, exploration and exploratory drilling often trade equity for financing.|$|E
5|$|Helen became pregnant; Simpson's {{apartment}} in Paris was now <b>unsuitable</b> {{and a larger}} home in France was not in their means. In October, with help from his friend, Albert Beurick, they moved into a small cottage in Ghent. Low on funds, Simpson earned money in one-day track races in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{compounds}} {{have been identified}} using ethnobotany, investigating plants used by indigenous peoples for possible medical applications. Some important phytochemicals, including curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein and resveratrol are pan-assay interference compounds, meaning that in vitro studies of their activity often provide unreliable data. As a result, phytochemicals have frequently proven <b>unsuitable</b> as lead compounds in drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, two Arco cattlemen named Arthur Ferris and J.W. Powell {{became the}} first known people to explore the lava fields. They were {{investigating}} its possible use for grazing and watering cattle but found the area to be <b>unsuitable</b> and left.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Hooper {{directed}} two {{episodes of}} Granada Television's comedy-drama television series Cold Feet, which marked his move to bigger-budget productions. There was initially concern at Granada that Hooper {{might be an}} <b>unsuitable</b> director for the series given his background in drama.|$|E
5|$|In Britain and elsewhere, {{commercial}} forestry has created new habitat which has increased numbers, but these gains {{are likely to}} be temporary as the woodland develops and becomes <b>unsuitable</b> for nightjars. In the United Kingdom, it is red-listed as a cause for concern, and in Ireland it is close to extinction.|$|E
5|$|In a charge-only cable, {{the data}} wires are shorted at the device end. These wires are usually green and white. If these wires are left as-is, the device will often reject the charger as <b>unsuitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|In intensively farmed {{areas where}} {{agricultural}} practices {{appear to have}} made cropped land <b>unsuitable,</b> gardens are an important breeding habitat. In one English study, only 3.5% of territories were found in farmland, whereas gardens held 71.5% of the territories, despite that habitat making up only 2% of the total area. The remaining nests were in woodlands (1% of total area).|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Abercrombie's {{plans were}} revived by the Greater London Council (GLC) as the London Ringways Plan which {{proposed}} {{the construction of}} a series of motorways in and around London to control traffic congestion. The existing South Circular route was recognised as being <b>unsuitable</b> for upgrading and a new motorway, Ringway 2, was planned for construction further south.|$|E
5|$|Lagenidium giganteum is a {{water-borne}} mould that parasitizes the {{larval stage}} of mosquitoes. When applied to water, the motile spores avoid <b>unsuitable</b> host species and search out suitable mosquito larval hosts. This alga has {{the advantages of}} a dormant phase, resistant to desiccation, with slow-release characteristics over several years. Unfortunately, it is susceptible to many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} film, the {{production}} of Jaws 2 was troubled. The original director, John D. Hancock, proved to be <b>unsuitable</b> for an action film {{and was replaced by}} Szwarc. Scheider, who only reprised his role to end a contractual issue with Universal, was also unhappy during production and had several heated exchanges with Szwarc.|$|E
5|$|No {{version of}} the game has been {{released}} outside Japan. This {{has been attributed to}} Nintendo's policy of censoring religious references in games, which rendered the early Megami Tensei titles <b>unsuitable</b> for localization due to their central religious elements. A fan translation of Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei was released on August 28, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Painted turtle pet-keeping {{requirements}} {{are similar to}} those of the red-eared slider. Keepers are urged to provide them with adequate space and a basking site, and water that is regularly filtered and changed. According to Petco, the animals are described as being somewhat <b>unsuitable</b> for children as they do not enjoy being held. Hobbyists have kept turtles alive for decades.|$|E
5|$|Robert Russell as John Stearne. Playing Hopkins's thuggish assistant, Russell {{certainly}} {{looked the}} part. However, as filming progressed, Reeves found the actor's high-pitched voice <b>unsuitable</b> {{for such a}} rough character, and after production was completed he had all of his dialogue dubbed by another actor, Jack Lynn (who also appeared in a small role as an innkeeper).|$|E
5|$|Steep and {{strewn with}} rapids, the Kootenay, despite being <b>unsuitable</b> for {{commercial}} transportation of agricultural and mineral products, {{is considered an}} outstanding whitewater river. Whitewater rafting is popular on the Kootenay in two stretches: in Jennings Canyon between the Libby Dam in Montana and Bonners Ferry in Idaho, and in {{the upper reaches of}} the river in Kootenay National Park in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The Maya had few {{domestic}} animals; {{dogs were}} domesticated by 3000 BC, and the Muscovy duck by the Late Postclassic. Ocellated turkeys were <b>unsuitable</b> for domestication, but were rounded {{up in the}} wild and penned for fattening. All of these were used as food animals; dogs were additionally used for hunting. It is possible that deer were also penned and fattened.|$|E
5|$|The {{avionics}} were <b>unsuitable</b> due to poor {{risk analysis}} and necessary requirements {{omitted from the}} procurement contract. The Times claimed that the Ministry of Defence planned to perform software integration itself, without Boeing's involvement, {{in order to reduce}} costs. While lacking certification, the helicopters were only permitted to fly in visual meteorological conditions and subsequently stored in climate controlled hangars.|$|E
5|$|The local farming {{community}} {{raised concerns about}} cattle being <b>unsuitable</b> for the area, while the concerns were not immediately addressed Avondale was turned towards seed production and research. The first research began in 1926; {{this was in the}} application of superphosphate its alternatives and the timing of application. Initial results were published in the Journal of Agriculture in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The primary predators of {{this species}} are diurnal birds of prey, such as falcons and hawks. During nesting, corvids, grackles, housecats, or rat snakes will prey on their eggs. Cowbirds rarely parasitize {{mourning}} dove nests. Mourning doves reject slightly under a third of cowbird eggs in such nests, and the mourning dove's vegetarian diet is <b>unsuitable</b> for cowbirds.|$|E
5|$|Tourism is {{the main}} {{industry}} of Pichilemu, especially in the urban centre and some rural areas such as Cáhuil and Ciruelos. Forestry, mainly pine and eucalyptus, is another major industry. The area is also known for handicrafts. Although fishing is not very important to O'Higgins Region, due to <b>unsuitable</b> coastlines, it is common in Pichilemu, Bucalemu, and Navidad.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unsuitable</b> {{backyard}} {{fruit tree}} netting also kills many animals and may {{bring them into}} close contact with humans, but can be avoided by using wildlife-safe netting. Barbed wire may also lead to casualties; this can be ameliorated by removing old or unnecessary barbed wire or marking it with bright paint.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} ESRO program was initiated, the agency moved towards {{satellites}} {{with a higher}} orbital eccentricity and escape orbits. The facilities in Ny-Ålesund were <b>unsuitable</b> for telemetry with such satellites, as they would operate at a different frequency, {{the size of the}} antenna dish was too small and the ground station's geographical position was out of range. Because of the change of ESRO's focus, the need for a telemetry station on Svalbard disappeared after the termination of ESRO's initial program, and the facility was closed in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a further}} tiny energy gain could be {{extracted}} by synthesizing 62Ni, {{which has a}} marginally higher binding energy than 56Fe, conditions in stars are <b>unsuitable</b> for this process. Element production in supernovas and distribution on Earth greatly favor iron over nickel, and in any case, 56Fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons. Hence, elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation, involving rapid neutron capture by starting 56Fe nuclei.|$|E
5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may {{take a long time}} to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely <b>unsuitable</b> for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{literature}} has been preserved {{on a wide}} variety of media. This includes papyrus scrolls and packets, limestone or ceramic ostraca, wooden writing boards, monumental stone edifices and coffins. Texts preserved and unearthed by modern archaeologists represent a small fraction of ancient Egyptian literary material. The area of the floodplain of the Nile is under-represented because the moist environment is <b>unsuitable</b> for the preservation of papyri and ink inscriptions. On the other hand, hidden caches of literature, buried for thousands of years, have been discovered in settlements on the dry desert margins of Egyptian civilization.|$|E
5|$|At Hitler's behest, the Volkssturm (People's Storm) – a {{nationwide}} militia of men previously considered <b>unsuitable</b> {{for military service}} – was formed on 18 October 1944. Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his Gau alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve {{on the front lines}} against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Before her {{presentation}} to Charles, Isabeau visited Hainaut {{for about a}} month, staying with her granduncle Duke Albert I, ruler of some of Bavaria-Straubing and Count of Holland. Albert's wife, Margaret of Brieg, replaced Isabeau's Bavarian style of dress, deemed <b>unsuitable</b> as French courtly attire, and taught her etiquette suitable to the French court. She learned quickly, suggestive of an intelligent and quick-witted character. On 13July 1385 she traveled to Amiens to be presented to Charles.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the opening}} of the Barlow Road, pioneers {{traveling}} by land from the east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission (now The Dalles) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, then a perilous and expensive journey. It was also possible to drive livestock over Lolo Pass {{on the north side of}} Mount Hood, but that trail was too rugged for vehicles and <b>unsuitable</b> for wagons.|$|E
5|$|Bridgeport {{was struck}} from the Navy List on 2 October 1941, {{and she was}} {{acquired}} by the Bridgeport Steamship Co. on 2 February 1942 for conversion to merchant service. She proved <b>unsuitable</b> for service as a cargo carrier, and was returned to the government a few months later, when the War Shipping Administration (WSA) took her over on 29 June 1942. The WSA transferred the ship to the War Department in November 1942.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles was {{initially}} kept at the Jackson family's home in Encino, Los Angeles, but {{was moved to}} Neverland Ranch in 1988. There, he slept in a crib in Jackson's bedroom, used the singer's toilet and ate candy in the Neverland movie theater. By 2003, like many captive chimpanzees, Bubbles had matured into a large and aggressive adult chimp <b>unsuitable</b> as a companion animal. He {{was sent to a}} California animal trainer. When the trainer closed his operation in 2004, Bubbles was moved to the Center for Great Apes, a sanctuary in Wauchula, Florida, where he has lived since 2005.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are farmed {{for meat}} and skins in South America. The meat is {{considered}} <b>unsuitable</b> {{to eat in}} some areas, while in other areas it is considered {{an important source of}} protein. In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously issued special dispensation to allow it to be eaten while other meats are generally forbidden.|$|E
