40|$|We {{develop a}} principled {{strategy}} to sample a function optimally for function approximation tasks within a Bayesian framework. Using ideas from optimal experiment design, we introduce an objective function (incorporating both bias and variance) {{to measure the}} degree of approximation, and the potential utility of the data points towards optimizing this objective. We show how the general strategy {{can be used to}} derive precise algorithms to select data for two cases: learning <b>unit</b> <b>step</b> <b>functions</b> and polynomial functions. In particular, we investigate whether such active algorithms can learn the target with fewer examples. We obtain theoretical and empirical results to suggest that this is the case. 1 INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION Learning from examples is a common supervised learning paradigm that hypothesizes a target concept given a stream of training examples that describes the concept.

40|$|The {{statistics}} of filtered pseudorandom digital sequences called hybrid-sum sequences, formed from the modulo-two sum of several maximum-length sequences, are analyzed. The {{results indicate that}} a relation exists between the {{statistics of}} the filtered sequence and the characteristic polynomials of the component maximum length sequences. An analysis procedure is developed for identifying {{a large group of}} sequences with good statistical properties for applications requiring the generation of analog pseudorandom noise. By use of the analysis approach, the filtering process is approximated by the convolution of the sequence with a sum of <b>unit</b> <b>step</b> <b>functions.</b> A parameter reflecting the overall statistical properties of filtered pseudorandom sequences is derived. This parameter is called the statistical quality factor. A computer algorithm to calculate the statistical quality factor for the filtered sequences is presented, and the results for two examples of sequence combinations are included. The analysis reveals that the statistics of the signals generated with the hybrid-sum generator are potentially superior to the statistics of signals generated with maximum-length generators. Furthermore, fewer calculations are required to evaluate the statistics of a large group of hybrid-sum generators than are required to evaluate the statistics of the same size group of approximately equivalent maximum-length sequences...|$|R

40|$|A {{partially}} debonded piezoelectric actuator in smart composite laminates {{was modeled}} using an improved layerwise displacement field and Heaviside <b>unit</b> <b>step</b> <b>functions.</b> The {{finite element method}} with four node plate element and the extended Hamilton principle were used to derive the governing equation. The effects of actuator debonding on the smart composite laminate were investigated in both the frequency and time domains. The frequency and transient responses were obtained using the mode superposition method and the Newmark time integration algorithm, respectively. Two partial actuator debonding cases were studied to investigate the debonding effects on the actuation capability of the piezoelectric actuator. The effect of actuator debonding on the natural frequencies was subtler, but severe reductions of the actuation ability were observed in both the frequency and time responses, especially in the edge debonded actuator case. The results provided confirmation that the proposed modeling {{could be used in}} virtual experiments of actuator failure in smart composite laminates.

In neural network terminology, we are using a single-hidden-layer perceptron network implementing the ramp sigmoid activation function to approximate the indicator of a ball. In {{order to have a}} relative accuracy ϵ, we use T=c(d 2 /ϵ 2) ramp sigmoids, a result comparable to that of Cheang and Barron (2000) [4], where <b>unit</b> <b>step</b> activation <b>functions</b> are used instead. The result is then applied to functions that have variation Vf with respect to a class of ellipsoids. Two-hidden-layer feedforward neural nets with ramp sigmoid activation functions are used to approximate such functions. The approximation error is shown to be bounded by a constant times Vf/T 112 +Vfd/T 214, where T 1 is the number of nodes in the outer layer and T 2 is the number of nodes in the inner layer of the approximation fT 1,T 2...|$|R

40|$|Buckling of {{composite}} laminates with delaminations is studied {{based on}} a proposed isogeometric layerwise approach. The isogeometric approach employs the NURBS basis functions of the geometry’s description to approximate the physical response in an isoparametric sense. Layerwise theories provide an accurate prediction of the three-dimensional structural responses of composite laminates while maintaining a two-dimensional data structure. Usually, to model the delaminations through thickness, the displacement field is enriched with a <b>unit</b> <b>step</b> Heaviside <b>function</b> which allows for discontinuities at the delamination interfaces. An improved implementation of a displacement-based layerwise theory based on the isogeometric paradigm is proposed. The delaminated and undelaminated regions of the laminate are modeled as separate patches. For the undelaminated and delaminated patches respectively, the C 0 -continuity and discontinuity conditions of the displacement field at the ply interfaces can be easily facilitated within the isogeometric framework. More reliable and accurate buckling loads are obtained by considering a contact analysis across the delamination interfaces to avoid physically inadmissible buckling modes. The proposed model is verified using laminated composite beam plates. The results are compared to a classical layerwise approach. The numerical results confirm {{the accuracy of the}} proposed isogeometric model...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} {{a class of}} AND-OR tree circuits and study their response to random-pattern inputs as {{the depth of the}} tree is allowed to increase indefinitely. Each binary input of a circuit is independently chosen to be one (zero) with probability x (1 - x).

The probability transfer function of an AND-OR tree is shown to have just one interior fixed point (w. r. t. changes in depth of the tree) in the (0, 1) range of x. Its value is of interest in random testing, being the input bias probability which optimizes the average length of random test for the circuit.
