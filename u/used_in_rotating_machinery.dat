This type of critical response prediction capability, if accurate and reliable, has broad potential <b>use</b> <b>in</b> the <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> industry. Many machines have close clearance points on their shafts, such as seals, which can easily be damaged by excess vibration. Accurate estimates of the actual level of vibration at these points could usefully assist machine operators in troubleshooting and in protecting the equipment from expensive damage. This type of response information can be used both to generate less conservative alarm limits and, if magnetic bearings are available, to directly guide the bearing controllers in restricting the rotor motion at these critical points. It is assumed that the disturbance forces acting upon the rotor are predominantly synchronous (e. g., mass unbalance.)

Theoretically, steel sheets, varnish layers and prestressing {{make it difficult to}} homogenize the constitutive properties of a stack both at rest and under operating conditions. Moreover, it is noteworthy that tie rods subjected to centrifugal forces bend until reaching annular clearance. Their nonlinear bending tends to increase their stiffening effects and the axial lamination load, therefore it affects the homogenized constitutive properties of a stack modeled with Timoshenko beams. By combining a fixed-point algorithm and penalty method at each speed of rotation, it is possible to plot the Campbell diagram and unbalance responses by considering updated properties and the axial load of the tie rods generated by centrifugal effects.

They offer several advantages over conventional mechanical bearings including non-contact rotor support (thus eliminating mechanical wear {{and the need for}} lubricants), ability to tune bearing parameters through software for optimum machine performance, remote monitoring and health diagnostic, etc. In some applications, such as in a vacuum or in aggressive environments, they are often the only viable solution. An electromagnetic actuator, along with a position sensor and control electronics, is a key component of AMBs. While there is a variety of actuator designs described in the literature, most of the AMBs built commercially use heteropolar radial electrical actuators in combination with a dedicated electrically-biased axial actuators. On the contrary, since its inception in 1998, Calnetix Technologies mainly uses homopolar permanent magnet (PM) -biased radial actuators along with a homopolar PM-biased combination radial/axial actuators.

40|$|Abstract. The {{fault of}} a bearing may cause the {{breakdown}} of a rotating machine, leading to serious consequences. A rolling element bearing {{is an important part}} of, and is widely <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery.</b> Therefore, fault diagnosis of rolling bearings is important for guaranteeing production efficiency and plant safety. Although many studies have been carried out with the goal of achieving fault diagnosis of a bearing, most of these works were studied for rotating machinery with a high rotating speed rather than with a low rotating speed. Fault diagnosis for bearings under a low rotating speed, is more difficult than under a high rotating speed. Because bearing faults signal is very weak under a low rotating speed. This work acquires vibration and acoustic emission signals from the rolling bearing under low speed respectively, and analyzes the both kinds of signals in time domain and frequency domain for diagnosing the typical bearing faults contrastively. This paper also discussed the advantages using the acoustic emission signal for fault diagnosis of rolling speed bearing. From the results of analysis and experiment we can find the effectiveness of acoustic emission signal is better than vibration signal for fault diagnosis of a bearing under the low speed...|$|E

40|$|The torque {{fluctuation}} {{due to the}} intermittent combustion {{pressure and}} inertia effect of the reciprocating parts generates torsional excitation on the crankshaft of all internal combustion engines. This excitation imposes considerable amount of torsional vibration on the crankshaft. Therefore the torsional vibration modeling and design of an auxiliary absorbing mechanism are very crucial, especially in locomotive diesel engines where the crankshaft is under excitation with high amplitude coupled with large inertia forces due to generators, compressors or fans. In this research, the capability of centrifugal pendulum vibration absorbers (CPVA) commonly <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> to attenuate the torsional vibration in a Locomotive V-type diesel engine crankshaft is investigated.

Vibration based condition monitoring is the most common method for extracting some important information to identify bearing defects. However, acquired acceleration signals are usually noisy, which significantly affects the results of fault diagnosis. Wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) is a powerful method utilized effectively for the denoising of the signals acquired. Furthermore, Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is a newly developed decomposition method to solve the mode mixing problem of empirical mode decomposi- tion (EMD), which is a consequence of signal intermittence.

A simulation tool for journal bearings has been developed in the commercial software Comsol Multiphysics, which utilises the finite element method (FEM) as numerical technique. The simulation tool enables analysis of different bearing dimensions with variations in the geometry, such as grooves. The geometry is either imported from computer aided design (CAD) software or generated from input data within Comsol. Different predefined modules within Comsol have been utilised to increase the ease of use of the tool, e. g. thin film flow and structural mechanics theory. This also allows for coupling between physics {{to be made in}} a straightforward manner. Cavitation has been taken into consideration by using a cavitation model that is based on scaling the density and viscosity of the lubricant, depending on pressure. This cavitation model is mass conserving and fulfils the Jakobsson-Floberg-Olsson (JFO) rupture and reformation boundary conditions. Other phenomena like power losses, deformation and stress have also been included. Different parameters have been investigated in both static- and dynamic analyses, where various cases have been compared to data from previous studies in the field, in order to validate the simulation tool.

40|$|The {{rolling element}} {{bearings}} (REB's) which support many turbomachinery rotors offer high load capacity, low power requirements, and durability. Two disadvantages of REB's are as follows: rolling or sliding contact within the bearing has life-limiting consequences; and REB's provide essentially no damping. The REB's in the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) turbopumps must sustain high static and dynamic loads, at high speeds, with a cryogenic fluid as lubricant and coolant. The pump end ball bearings limit {{the life of}} the SSME high pressure oxygen turbopump (HPOTP). Compliant foil bearing (CFB) manufacturers have proposed replacing turbopump REB's with CFB's. CFB's work well in aircraft air cycle machines, auxiliary power units, and refrigeration compressors. In a CFB, the rotor only contacts the foil support structure during start up and shut down. CFB damping is higher than REB damping. However, the load capacity of the CFB is low, compared to a REB. Furthermore, little stiffness and damping data exist for the CFB. A rotordynamic analysis for turbomachinery critical speeds and stability requires the input of bearing stiffness and damping coefficients. The two basic types of CFB are the tension-dominated bearing and the bending-dominated bearing. Many investigators have analyzed and measured characteristics of tension-dominated foil bearings, which are applied principally in magnetic tape recording. The bending-dominated CFB is <b>used</b> more <b>in</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery.</b> Recently, a new tension-foil bearing configuration has been proposed for turbomachinery applications...|$|R

The oil-film force of hydrodynamic bearing is often characterized {{by a set of}} linear stiffness and damping coefficients. However the linear oil-film coefficients with respect to an equilibrium position of the journal are inaccurate when the bearing system vibrates with large amplitudes due to a dynamic load. The study on nonlinear oil-film forces is still rare and most papers are confined to theoretical analyses. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to derive some new non-linear force models (28 -co., 24 -co. and 36 -co. models) to identify these dynamic coefficients based on experimental data. The fundamental test model is obtained from a Taylor series expansion of bearing reaction force. Tests were performed with a nominal diameter of 100 mm and a length–to–diameter ratio of 0. 7 using a suitable test rig in which it is possible to apply the static load in any direction.

40|$|Tilting–pad journal {{bearings}} (TPJBs) are widely <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> {{to support the}} rotors efficiently at elevated speeds under light/heavy loadings. Because {{of the importance of}} this machine component, many authors have published several theoretical and experimental studies, to evaluate the influence of clearance, lubricant temperature, oil flow-rate and thermal effects on behavior of TPJB. However, the investigations of the influence of loading direction on properties of TPJB are very limited. In bearing models as well as in experimental tests, the load is often assumed along the vertical direction only and the geometry of the bearing is the same for each pad, which corresponds to an axial symmetry of the bearing. This paper presents first a theoretical analysis of the influence of the load direction on both the static and the dynamic behavior of a five-pad TPJB with a non-uniform clearance: that is, the different bearing configurations in the range between load-on-pad (LOP) and load-between-pads (LBP) are investigated. Then, the analytical results are compared with experimental measurements. The tests were performed with a nominal diameter of 100 mm and a length– to–diameter ratio of 0. 7, using a suitable test-rig, in which it is possible to apply the static load in any direction. The procedure for the estimation of the bearing geometry from experimental measurement of the non-uniform clearance profile is also described. The results show that the load direction has considerable effects on both the static and the dynamic characteristics of the TPJB. Besides, the influence of load directions is stronger on the dynamic characteristics of tilting pad bearing than on the static ones...|$|E

Although numerous studies have been done for damage identification using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and feature extraction from intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), EMD has some drawbacks such as sifting stop criterion and mode mixing which make some limitations. In addition, acquired vibration signals used to damage identification are usually noisy which have great influence on the results. Thus, one of the great challenges of EMD technique is that, especially for small defect sizes, it seems {{not to be able to}} recognize healthy and faulty condition of a bearing. An intelligent sensitive method is needed to detect damage automatically before growing the defect size. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is a newly developed noise assisted method to solve mode mixing problem which is a consequence of signal intermittence.

Damage identification of roller bearings has been deeply developed to detect faults using vibration-based signal processing. There exist different signal processing techniques to decompose a signal and extract informative features such as EMD and Wavelet transform. EMD is a method for decomposing a multi- component signal into several elementary Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and has been widely applied to fault diagnosis of rotating machines. However, there are some drawbacks such as stopping criterion for sifting process, mode mixing and border effect problem. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is a newly developed noise assisted method to solve mode mixing problem exists in empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. Since the white noise is added throughout the entire signal decomposition process, mode mixing is effectively eliminated. However, there is still a great challenge: identifying two effective parameters (the amplitude of added noise and the number of ensemble trials) which may affect the performance of EEMD. Using low amplitude (relative to the signal), mode mixing cannot be prevented. On the other hand, too large amplitude achieves some redundant IMFs. Although some algorithm or values have been proposed, there is no robust guide to select optimal amplitude yet, especially for early damage detection (very small defects). In this study a reliable method is investigated to determine suitable amplitude and numerous real vibration signals (various operating conditions and two damage locations) are analysed to verify effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

The defect in rolling elements may lead to serious catastrophic consequences resulting in costly downtime. For this purpose, the vibration analysis technique which is a reliable and accurately detecting defect in the bearing elements is used.

40|$|For {{dynamical}} systems having several {{degrees of}} freedom, motion {{in one direction}} can induce motion in the other. This {{means that there is}} a certain coupling between these two motions. Coupling can in some cases be a source of instability that causes self-excited vibrations <b>in</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery.</b> <b>In</b> classical modeling of rotor systems, couplings other than those that are the result of gyroscopic effect are normally not considered. This is due to thecomplexity of the reasons for coupling which mainly depends on machinery hardware, for example, the bearings’ design (type) and the asymmetry in machine components. Plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journal-bearings provide high damping to the rotorsystem, but they also cross couple the rotor translational motions. Cross coupling is the main source of oil induced instability; therefore, the rotor speed should not exceed the speed at which oil-induced instability occurs. The inherent nonlinearity of plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journal- bearings becomes strong for eccentricities greater than 60 % of the bearing clearance, where most existing linear models are not able to accurately predict the rotor trajectory. Strong nonlinearities together with cross coupling are the source of complex dynamics in fluid-film journal bearings. The journal bearing impedance descriptions method, a method that is valid for all bearing aspect ratios and all eccentricities, was used to evaluate linear analysis of the rotor steady-state imbalance response. The results show that linear bearing models derived from the nonlinear impedance descriptions of the Moes-cavitated (π-film) finite-length bearing can predict the steady-state imbalance response of a rigid symmetric rotor that is supported by two identical journal-bearings at high eccentricities. This is, however, only the case when operating conditions are below the threshold speed of instability and when the system has period one solutions. The error increases in the vicinity of resonance speed. A combi-bearing is a fluid-film lubricated tilting-pad thrust and journal bearings combined together. Thrust bearing is <b>used</b> <b>in</b> vertical <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> and shafts designed to transmit thrust. The total axial load is carried by the single thrust bearing. The analyzed combi-bearing is an existing machine component <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the hydropower unit Porjus U 9 situated in northern Sweden. The linearized model shows that the combi-bearing couples the rotor’s lateral and angular motions. However, if the thrust bearing’s pads arrangement is not symmetrical or if all the pads are not angularly equidistant the rotor axial and angular motions are also coupled. This last case of coupling will also occur if the thrust bearing equivalent total stiffness is not evenly distributed over the thrust bearing. A defected pad or unequal hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the pads’ surfaces may be the cause. The Porjus U 9 ’s simulation results show that the combi-bearing influences the dynamic behavior of the machine. The rotor motions’ coupling due to combi-bearing changes the system’s natural frequencies and vibration modes. Godkänd; 2011; 20111010 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} are <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> {{in various}} industry branches. Their health status must be monitored continuously {{in order to}} establish proper operational conditions in a production process. Numerous approaches, which can be investigated under the subject of ``Condition Based Maintenance", have been studied within mechanical engineering and signal processing to be able to detect and classify possible faults on rolling bearings. Periodic impulsive signals can emerge from defected bearings within rotating machinery. As the signal is distorted by an unknown transfer function, noise and severe interference, the challenge becomes to reduce these effects as much as possible to extract valuable and reliable information about the rolling bearings' health status. Without any observation of the source signal, a scale-invariant higher order moment, skewness, {{can be used as a}} tool to characterize statistical properties to enhance the desired signal. It is the impulsiveness, thus asymmetry of the signal that will be promoted. To assess the performance of skewness, a signal model that consists of harmonically related sinusoids representing an impulsive source is built. Depending on such a model, surface characteristics of skewness are investigated. In relation to harmonic content, the ability of skewness in discovering such harmonic relation is studied. It has been observed that the optimization process converges to a setting where all harmonics are preserved, while any component that does not possess such a harmonic relation is suppressed. In the case of multiple mutually inharmonic source signals with harmonic support, it is shown that skewness maximization results in a setting where only the harmonic set with highest skewness remains. Finally, experimental examples are provided to support theoretical findings.

Traditional plain and labyrinth seals are being replaced with stators containing different roughness patterns to reduce leakage and enhance rotor response.

Simplified models based on bulk flow theory and Moody??????s approach to characterize wall friction in pipes cannot explain this outcome.

An exhaustive 3 -D numerical analysis of several experiments with liquid annular seals has been performed using a CFD code. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent channel flow and smooth seals were replicated within 1 % using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and turbulence modeling. Similarly, measured groove seal leakage rates were reproduced within 2 %. On the other hand, no turbulence model combination predicts the leakage in most 3 -D pattern roughened seals with the same accuracy. Present results reproduce the friction factor ??????plateau?????? behavior predicted with the 2 -D analysis and observed in the flat plate experiments. They also reproduce the friction-factor-to-clearance indifference behavior, the maximum friction factor observed in a specific roughness pattern size is independent of the actual clearance in a certain Reynolds number range, but clarify the role of the roughness length-to-clearance ratio and the actual roughness size in defining the friction-factor-toclearance proportionality. All simulations indicate that roughened surface area and roughness aspect ratios are the parameters defining the friction factor at a given seal clearance. The roughness pattern size, relevant in determining the friction-factor-to-clearance proportionality, plays a moderate role once the above cited ratios are defined. In any shape and size, shallow patterns are predicted and observed to provide larger friction factors than deep patterns. Predictions also confirm limited experimental data showing that friction factor is affected by the mean flow orientation relative to the roughness pattern. Solving RANS equations is sufficient to model simple seal geometries but might not be enough to replicate turbulent flow in liquid annular seals with roughened surfaces...|$|E

As an efficient mechanical system, helical gearbox has been widely <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> such as wind turbines, helicopters, compressors and internal combustion engines and hence its vibration condition monitoring is attracting substantial research attention worldwide. However, the vibration signals from a gearbox are usually contaminated by background noise and influenced by operating conditions.

This study focus on developing effective approaches to the detection of early stage faults in an industrial helical gearbox. In particular, continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) has been investigated in order to select an optimal wavelet to effectively represent the vibration signals for both noise reduction and fault signature extraction. To achieve this aim, time synchronous average (TSA) {{is used as a}} tool for preliminary noise reduction and mathematical models of a gearbox transmission system is developed for characterising fault signatures. The performance of three different wavelet families was compared and henceforth a criterion and method for the selection of the most discerning has been established. It has been found that the wavelet that gives the highest RMS value for the baseline vibration signal will show the greatest difference between baseline and gearbox vibration with a fault presence. Comparison of the three wavelets families shows that the Daubechies order 1 can give best performance for feature extraction and fault detection and fault quantification. However, there are limitations that undermine CWT application to fault detection, in particular the difficulty in selecting a suitable wavelet function. A major contribution of this research programme is to demonstrate a possible route on how to overcome this deficiency. An adaptive Morlet wavelet transform method has been proposed based on information entropy optimization for analysing the vibration signal and detecting and quantifying the faults seeded into the helical gearbox. This research has also developed a nonlinear dynamic model of the two-stage helical gearbox involving time–varying mesh stiffness and transmission error. Based on experimental data collected with different operating loads and the simulating results vibration signatures for gear faults are fully understood and hence confirms the CWT based scheme for signal enhancement. These results also indicate that the dynamic model can be used in studying gear faults and would be useful in developing gear fault monitoring techniques...|$|E
40|$|In the {{theoretical}} analysis of high speed rotor bearing systems, {{it is common}} to use four displacement and four velocity based coefficients, which characterise the behaviour of the lubricating fluid film. Although a great deal of work has been published establishing theoretical models of all types of hydrodynamic journal bearings, the large amount of experimental work has centred on relatively low speed conditions. This work presents a contribution to the experimental study of the static and dynamic characteristics of oil films <b>in</b> journal bearings <b>used</b> <b>in</b> high-speed <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery.</b> The main objectives of the work are: • To devise new experimental techniques for the measurement of dynamic coefficients suitable for use at high rotational speeds • To design, manufacture, assemble and commission a test facility to measure the static and dynamic characteristics of journal bearings at speeds up to 30000 rpm • To determine the static and dynamic characteristics of a 5 Pad Tilting Pad Journal Bearing Unit of 80 mm diameter at speeds up to 25 000 rpm using the said test facility. New techniques are particularly necessary for the measurement of velocity coefficients because these invoke the necessity of imposing a velocity on to the bearing housing and previous techniques have utilised synchronous motion of the bearing. Consequently a new experimental procedure for measuring the four velocity or damping coefficients of an oil film journal bearing from imposed dynamic "orbits" has been devised called the "double pulse" technique. All four velocity coefficients are derived from one imposed journal centre dynamic orbit and, therefore may be regarded as being obtained at the same time. The method requires the production of a "cross- over" point similar to that of a "figure of eight" shaped orbit and utilises the "cross-over" point therein. Coefficients are initially evaluated in a co-ordinate system, which is chosen to align with the designated parts of the measured orbit. Each coefficient is then evaluated from single values of instantaneous imposed force and resulting journal centre velocity. Coefficients are them converted into any other desired axes system. The result is a simpler experimental procedure, with reduced uncertainty compared to hitherto existing methods. The use of non-sinusoidal excitation of the oil film was explored, in the form of applying a step-pulse train load pattern to produce a cross-over pattern in the journal displacement ·orbit'. Experimental tests were completed on a tilting pad bearing at speeds up to 15 000 rpm inclusive. At speeds above this, the bearing exhibited a vibrational response, which precluded the accurate measurement of journal centre displacement...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{concerned}} with the analysis and development of a decanter centrifuge. The aim {{of the project was}} to increase the understanding of the operation of the machine, and identify and implement methods of improving the performance. A comprehensive breakdown of the power consumption of a GTech-Bellmor 1456 Centrifuge Decanter was completed. There are four components of the power consumption in a decanter centrifuge: friction during product transport, viscous and kinetic losses during feed acceleration, inefficiencies in power transmission components, and aerodynamic losses, known as windage. A mathematical model was developed to predict the power, torque, and axial force required by product transport. A relationship for the power consumed during feed acceleration was derived from first principles. The power transmission losses are comprised of inefficiencies in the motors, belt drives, gearbox, bearings, and seals; each of these was quantified. The windage has two components: the surface drag on the bowl as it <b>rotates</b> <b>in</b> an annular space and the pressure drag on external protrusions. The windage was predicted empirically and computationally. Methods that were identified for improving the decanter centrifuge were: reduce the mass of bowl and scroll, improve wear resistance, reduce the coefficient of friction of the bowl wall and scroll faces, optimise scroll geometry, redesign the feed accelerator to increase acceleration efficiency, implement control of the bowl speed, differential speed, and pool depth, and recess the bolt heads on the bowl and cover the third phase ports. An analysis of several worn centrifuges revealed {{that the majority of the}} wear occurs on the scroll, bowl wall, accelerator, and solids discharge ports. An experiment was developed to recreate the wear conditions inside a centrifuge. A high pressure abrasive film was forced between materials moving relative to each other. Similar results were observed for acetel, UHMWPE, and 316 stainless steel when using a pin-on-disk wear test rig. A new composite bowl was developed for two main reasons, weight reduction, and improved wear and friction characteristics. The full design process was applied to the bowl and several concepts were generated for a new scroll. The design of the bowl included conceptual design, material selection, material testing, constructing scale models, and the manufacture of a full-size bowl for a GTech-Bellmor 1456 Centrifuge Decanter. The potential for <b>using</b> composite materials <b>in</b> decanter centrifuges was demonstrated. The manufacturing method developed during this project was novel and produced parts suitable for <b>use</b> <b>in</b> high-speed <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery.</b> The feed accelerator analysis consisted of three components: theoretical, experimental, and computational analysis. Three feed acceleration mechanisms were identified: viscous dissipation, impulse force, and mass flow induced velocity. An experimental method was developed to examine decanter centrifuge feed accelerator designs. The method allowed for the measurement of efficiency and high-speed photography of the flow between the accelerator and the rotating pool. The order of best to worst performing of the six tested designs was Modified Disk, Disk, Plate, Conical, Drum, and Esbjerg. The feed accelerator was modelled using ANSYS-CFX 14. 5 and compared to the experimental results. There was excellent agreement between the flow in the annular space observed using high-speed photography and the paths predicted using the computational model. A parametric study of the Drum and Disk feed accelerator designs was undertaken using the computational model. It was found that increasing the surface area of the port faces of the Drum accelerator and increasing the discharge angle and discharge radius for the Disk accelerator improved the performance...|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{signal and}} {{lubricant}} oil condition {{are two major}} sources of information for machine health condition monitoring. Though vibration signal is an indirect indicator of machine conditions, it contains very rich information. On the other hand, the lubricating oil analysis provides a direct indicator of machine health conditions. The joint use of the two sources of information would compensate for their limitations and thus better maintenance actions can be expected. However, this alone is not sufficient since the two sources are often severely contaminated by background and machine interference noises. Using such contaminated data without careful de-noising will inevitably cause misleading maintenance decisions and hence premature machine failure as well as lost productivity. As such, this thesis addresses the de-noising issues for both vibration and oil condition signals. Due to different natures of the vibration signals and signals measured through oil debris monitoring sensors, different approaches will be developed in this study for the enhancement of {{the two types of}} signals. In de-noising vibration signals, this research focuses on bearings since they {{are one of the most}} vulnerable and frequently <b>used</b> components <b>in</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery.</b> The results obtained based on bearings could be applied to other rotating machine components with some modifications. Wavelet transform, in particular the Gabor wavelet transform, has been used for de-noising impulsive signals measured from faulty bearings. However, it has been a challenging task to select proper wavelet parameters. This work introduces a method to guide the selection process by a smoothness index (SI). The SI is defined as the ratio of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean of the wavelet coefficient moduli of the vibration signal. For the signal contaminated by Gaussian white noise, we have shown that the modulus of the wavelet coefficients follows Rician distribution. Based on this observation, we then prove that the SI converges to a constant number (0. 8455 [...] .) in the absence of mechanical faults or for very low signal to noise ratio. This result provides a dimensionless SI upper bound corresponding to the most undesirable case. We have also shown that the SI value decreases in the presence of impulses with properly selected parameters. However, this approach is based on the assumption that the most impulsive components of the measured vibration are due to the faults. This assumption may not be valid in general. On the other hand, the proposed method requires a global search for the minimum SI for all combinations of wavelet parameters in the chosen discretized ranges which is a computationally demanding task. In addition, through bandpass filtering the signal, the in-band noise with frequency content in the range covered by the daughter wavelet is not eliminated. As a result, the performance of the wavelet filter based de-noising method deteriorates as the background noise intensity increases. To mitigate the above difficulties, a novel scale selection method is proposed. In this approach we incorporated our knowledge of the resonance frequency excitation phenomenon in the scale selection algorithm. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of the method, spectral subtraction is applied prior to wavelet transform. The proposed spectral subtraction method leads to improvements in both the final result of the process and the capability of the wavelet filter based de-noising method for lower SNR vibration signals. The proposed joint spectral subtraction and wavelet de-noising method has been successfully tested using experimental data. For the oil condition signals, the main issue is that the oil debris sensor is not only sensitive to the metal debris or particles but the structural vibrations as well. The weak signals of small particles are often concealed in the vibration signals. This either causes false alarm (since the shape of a particle signal resembles that of a vibration signal in certain ways) or leaves existent machine faults undetected. Adaptive Line Enhancement technique is proposed to remove such interferences. The method has been tested on both simulated and experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Seals {{are basic}} {{mechanical}} devices {{commonly used in}} machinery to avoid undesired flow losses of working fluids. To understand the working of these seals specifically those placed between relatively moving parts {{is still one of}} the major engineering challenges for the scientific community. Particularly Annular seals are one of the most widely <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> comprising turbines, compressors and pumps. They are mounted on the shaft that rotates within a stationary case. These seal designs make an impact on (i) machinery energy conversion efficiency and (ii) rotor dynamic stability due to the interaction between rotor and stator through fluid flow leakage. Among all annular seals straight through rectangular labyrinth seals are the most commonly used ones. Their designs have not changed much a lot since its inception by C. J. Parsons [1] back in 1901. These seals provide resistance to the fluid flow through tortuous path comprising of series of cavities and clearances. The sharp tooth converts the pressure energy to the kinetic which is dissipated through turbulence viscosity interaction in the cavity. To understand the accurate amount of leakage the flow is modeled using the discharge coefficient and for each tooth and the kinetic energy carry over coefficients. This research work is aimed at understanding the fluid flow though labyrinth seals with tooth mounted on the rotor. A matrix of fluid flow simulations has been carried out using commercially available CFD software Fluent? where all parameters effecting the flow field has been studied to understand their effect on the coefficients defining the seal losses. Also the rotor surface speed has been used varied in a step by step manner to understand the fluid flow behavior in high speed turbo-machinery. The carry over coefficient is found to be the function of all the geometric elements defining the labyrinth tooth configuration. A relation between the flow parameters and the carry over coefficient has also been established. The discharge coefficient of the first tooth has been found to be lower and varying in a different manner as compared to a tooth from a multiple cavity seal. Its dependence upon flow parameters and dimensionless geometric constants has been established. The discharge coefficient of the first teeth is found to be increasing with increasing tooth width. Further the compressibility factor has been defined to incorporate the deviation of the performance of seals with compressible fluid to that with the incompressible flow. Its dependence upon pressure ratio and shaft speed has also been established. Using all the above the mentioned relations it would be easy decide upon the tooth configuration for a given rotating machinery or understand the behavior of the seal currently in use...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} rotor {{flexibility and}} shaft speeds, turbomachinery undergoes large dynamic loads and displacements. Squeeze film dampers (SFDs) are {{a type of}} fluid film bearing <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> to attenuate rotor vibration, provide mechanical isolation, and/or to tune the placement of system critical speeds. Industry has {{a keen interest in}} designing SFDs that are small, lightweight, and mechanically simple. To achieve this, one must have a full understanding of how various design features affect the SFD forced performance. This thesis presents a comprehensive analysis, experimental and theoretical, of a short (L= 25. 4 mm) open ends SFD design incorporating three lubricant feed holes (without a circumferential feed groove). The damper radial clearance (c= 127 ?m), L/D ratio (0. 2), and lubricant (ISO VG 2) have similar dimensions and properties as in actual SFDs for aircraft engine applications. The work presents the identification of experimental force coefficients (K, C, M) from a 2 -DOF system model for circular and elliptical orbit tests over the frequency range ?= 10 - 250 Hz. The whirl amplitudes range from r= 0. 05 c- 0. 6 c, while the static eccentricity ranges from eS= 0 - 0. 5 c. Analysis of the measured film land pressures evidence that the deep end grooves (provisions for installation of end seals) contribute to the generation of dynamic pressures in an almost purely inertial fashion. Film land dynamic pressures show both viscous and inertial effects. Experimental pressure traces show the occurrence of significant air ingestion for orbits with amplitudes r> 0. 4 c, and lubricant vapor cavitation when pressures drop to the lubricant saturation pressure (PSAT~ 0 bar). Identified force coefficients show the damper configuration offers direct damping coefficients that are more sensitive to increases in static eccentricity (eS) than to increases in amplitude of whirl (r). On the other hand, SFD inertia coefficients are more sensitive to increases in the amplitude of whirl than to increases in static eccentricity. For small amplitude motions, the added or virtual mass of the damper is as large as 27 % of the bearing cartridge mass (MBC= 15. 15 kg). The identified force coefficients are shown to be insensitive to the orbit type (circular or elliptical) and the number of open feed holes (3, 2, or 1). Comparisons of damping coefficients between a damper employing a circumferential feed groove 1 and the current damper employing feed holes (no groove), show that both dampers offer similar damping coefficients, irrespective of the orbit amplitude or static eccentricity. On the other hand, the grooved damper shows much larger inertia force coefficients, at least ~ 60 % more. Predictions from a physics based model agree well with the experimental damping coefficients, however for large orbit motion, over predict inertia coefficients due to the model neglecting convective inertia effects. Credence is given to the validity of the linearized force coefficients by comparing the actual dissipated energy to the estimated dissipated energy derived from the identified force coefficients. The percent difference is below 25 % for all test conditions, and in fact is shown to be less than 5 % for certain combinations of orbit amplitude (r), static eccentricity (eS), and whirl frequency (?) ...|$|E
40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} {{are widely}} <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> across various industries and their failure is a dominant factor {{that contributes to}} machinery breakdown, consequently causing significant economic losses. Numerous experimental and analytical {{studies have been conducted}} in the past to understand the vibration response of non-defective and defective rolling element bearings, which have localised, extended, and distributed defects. Previous models have focused on simulating the defect-related impulses, which are generally observed in practice in measured vibration signals, and they implement envelope analysis to predict the significant defect-related frequency components. The work presented in this thesis is focused on developing an understanding of the underlying physical mechanism by which defect-related impulses are generated in defective rolling element bearings. A novel explicit dynamics finite element (FE) model of a rolling element bearing having a localised outer raceway defect, line spall, was developed and solved using a commercially available FE software package, LSDYNA. In addition to simulating the vibration response of the bearing, the dynamic contact interaction between the rolling elements and raceways of the bearing were modelled. An in-depth investigation of the rolling element-to-raceway contact forces was undertaken and variations in the forces, as the rolling elements traverse through the defect, were analysed. The contact force analysis has also {{led to the development of}} an understanding of the physics behind the low- and high-frequency characteristic vibration signatures generated by the rolling elements as they enter and exit a defect. It was found that no impulse-like signals are generated during the gradual de-stressing or unloading of the rolling elements as they enter into a defect, which explains the low-frequency characteristics of the de-stressing event. In contrast, a burst of multiple, short-duration, force impulses is generated as the rolling elements re-stress between the raceways in the vicinity of the end of a defect, which explains the high-frequency impulsive characteristics of the re-stressing event. Based on the results of the FE analysis of the rolling element bearing, a mathematical model was developed to predict the gradual de-stressing of the rolling elements as they enter into a raceway defect. Experimental testing on a rolling element bearing, commonly used in the railway industry, and having a line spall machined on its outer raceway was undertaken. The numerically modelled vibration response obtained using the FE model of the rolling element bearing was compared with the experimentally measured data, and a favourable agreement between the modelled and measured results was achieved. Numerical rolling element-to-raceway contact forces were compared with corresponding analytical results calculated using a quasi-static load distribution analytical model presented in this thesis. A parametric study to investigate the effects of varying radial load and rotational speed on the vibration response of the bearing and rolling element-to-raceway contact forces was undertaken. It was found that the magnitude of the defect-related vibration impulses and contact forces generated during the re-stressing of the rolling elements increases with increasing load and speed. The modelled contact forces were correlated with bearing vibration signals, and it was found that the amplitude of the contact forces and acceleration produced during the re-stressing of the rolling elements is much greater than when the rolling elements strike the defective surface. In other words, although a rolling element can impact the surface of a defect and generate a low amplitude acceleration signal, a much higher acceleration signal is generated when the rolling elements are re-stressed between the raceways as they exit from the defect. These higher acceleration signals, generated during the re-stressing phase, are the ones that are generally observed in practice, and subsequently used for bearing diagnosis. The work presented in this thesis has provided definitive physical and quantitative explanations for the impulsive acceleration signals measured when a bearing element passes through a defect.
