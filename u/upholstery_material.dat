50|$|Upholstered chairs {{first began}} to become common in the 17th century, in the later period of the Age of Oak. These used {{expensive}} fabrics as a covering, costing {{far more than the}} wooden frame of the chair. Other, cheaper, chairs were extensively carved in wood - any sort of chair, rather than a stool, was an luxury item. Leather, and Russia leather, was also used as an <b>upholstery</b> <b>material.</b> The use of Russia leather in particular was encouraged by the English Civil War and the Puritan styles it encouraged. Plain leather upholstery, even though an expensive item, was seen as less ostentatious and so more acceptable than either fabric or carving.|$|E

50|$|Blue marlin are {{aggressive}} {{fish that}} {{respond well to}} the splash, bubble trail, and action of a well-presented artificial lure. Trolling with lures {{is probably the most}} popular technique used by blue marlin crews today. Hawaii is recognized as the birthplace of lure trolling for marlin, with skippers operating from the Kona Coast of the Big Island of Hawaii developing many designs still used today. The earliest marlin lures were carved from wood, cast in drink glasses, or made from chrome bath towel pipes and skirted with rubber inner tubes or vinyl <b>upholstery</b> <b>material</b> cut into strips. Today, marlin lures are produced in a huge variety of shapes, sizes, and colours, mass-produced by large manufacturers and individually crafted by small-scale, custom makers.|$|E
50|$|The range's {{first major}} {{facelift}} for 1972 brought an uprated motor with new carburettor and ignition tuning, re-profiled camshaft {{and a plastic}} air cleaner housing (these models were always harder to keep in tune than their predecessors), smaller, squarer headlamps, a new dashboard with deeply hooded round dials (the Hunters had strip speedometers previously), high-backed front seats, and a revised silver trim panel surrounding the tail lights. These models carried over the previous models' <b>upholstery</b> <b>material</b> and colours {{for about a year}} but there was a mid-1973 change to the then-new 'wet look' vinyl across all Kiwi assembled Chrysler/Hillman models and the Hunter shared the new cream, brown and blue colours, retaining black dashboards and interior plastics (UK cars had fully colour matched interiors in different colours with available cloth trim, a material Todd's would not introduce till the Hunter's final years).|$|E
40|$|Most of {{consumer}} products during their processing are experiencing {{the state of}} biaxial deformation. Especially this {{can be said about}} the products made of sheet materials which during their manufacturing processes must obtain spatial shapes. Upholstered furniture production can be {{a good example of the}} industry which needs efficient solutions of such problems. On the other hand performance behaviour of applied materials must be simulated in a sufficiently realistic way. Up-to-date questions of fitting different sheet materials to Three-dimensional surface are analysed from the standpoint of the mechanical properties which are mainly defined by uniaxial tests. Besides, unsolved problems exist in describing the limits of external forces and acting during product processing, handling and consumption. Up till nowadays researches are treating this problem in a different way. Thus the aim of this investigation was to find out the relationships between the parameters of uniaxial mechanical properties and biaxial behaviour of <b>upholstery</b> <b>materials</b> (multilayer woven and knitted materials, leather and their fused systems) at different low levels, i. e. external processing and handling loads of different velocities and to define the effect of tested materials anisotropy level upon their biaxial performance.

5000|$|The first {{performance}} Delta was the Delta HF, {{which was}} introduced in July 1983 and went on sale in September after a first appearance at the Frankfurt Motor Show. the HF acronym—last used on the Stratos—stood for [...] "High Fidelity", and had been used on performance version of Lancia cars since 1966. It was front-wheel drive and powered by a turbocharged version of the 1.6-litre engine from the Delta GT; the system used a Garrett TBO- 225 turbocharger with wastegate valve, an air-to-air heat exchanger, a blow-through twin-choke Weber carburetor and Marelli Microplex ignition with pre-ignition control. To withstand the additional stress deriving from turbocharging upgrades {{were made to the}} oil system, with increased capacity and an oil cooler, and to the heads with sodium-filled valves. The gearbox was a ZF 5-speed unit. Dampers, springs and steering were retuned, and the tyres were wide 175/65 Michelin TRX on R 340 alloy wheels. In true Lancia tradition the exterior of the HF was relatively understated: changes were limited to silver [...] "HF" [...] badging on the grille, a deeper chin spoiler, black trim as on the GT, black roof drip rail mouldings, black side skirts with small silver [...] "turbo" [...] badges in front of the rear wheels, the 1982 roof spoiler painted in black, air intake cowls on the bonnet grilles, bronze-tinted athermic glass and 8-spoke alloy wheels.The cabin featured a leather-covered steering wheel and supplementary digital instrumentation with bar indicators; the <b>upholstery</b> <b>material</b> was the usual Zegna fabric, and Recaro sport seats covered in the same cloth optional.

40|$|Better {{wear and}} {{strength}} properties {{are required for}} upholstery textiles, this being the main distinction {{in opposition to the}} clothing textiles. It is crucial that the fabrics carry not only the best tensile properties, but are also investigated for the deformation properties, both inside and outside, by considering friction and loads appearing in the process of upholstery. Upholstery fabrics must be chosen considering the tensile properties and the deformational behaviour at low-stress loading, therefore the aim of this work was to investigate and evaluate the upholstery materials performance properties under uniaxial and biaxial deformations in respect to low-stress and breaking loading. Experimental analysis of upholstery materials uniaxial low-stress properties defined by the KES-F testing system was performed and the effect of the properties of upholstery materials determined by the KES-F testing system upon creep deformation processes was defined in this dissertation. Creep and relaxation processes of upholstery materials in respect to the anisotropy level under uniaxial loadings were analyzed. The effect of fused upholstery system structure upon the variations of its spatial shape under biaxial punching was defined as well as the effect of uniaxial pre-tension level upon biaxial punching deformation of fused upholstery systems was evaluated. Finally, the effect of friction in the contact zone between the punch and <b>upholstery</b> <b>material</b> surface during biaxial deformation process was determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to see the trends and material acting under influence of different loads and other anthropometric factors of subjects. Efforts were made to establish how much and to what extent body mass index (BMI) can serve as a variable in similar measurements and how reliable it is. The goal of the research is to establish the dependence of pressures on the human constitution and gender. The measurements were conducted on three different chair models (framed net, cold-casted PU foam and PU foam) and {{in a way that the}} ten subjects sat on a chair covered with the pressure mat. The results were analyzed in regard to the anthropometric characteristics of the subjects and the construction of the seat and they were compared with the results of the former subjective research conducted with the same seat constructions. The results of the subjective measurements show that the assessment according to the seat <b>upholstery</b> <b>material</b> as well as the answers to the question: Do you feel comfortable?, equal the results of the previous research.

30|$|As a {{simplified}} standard method, the ASTM 2187 {{should not be}} taken as the end-all solution to solve cigarette related fire risks. To address a smouldering cigarette as a fire source and <b>upholstery</b> <b>material</b> as an ignition target, current research proves that controlling oxygen diffusion into the burning coal is effective and directly related to the reduction of its heat influx to the surrounding environment. Extensive body of work has been done to establish a design window for a burning cigarette from sensory, smoke chemistry and smoke biological activity point of view, but still deliver reduced heat flux once in contact with a substrate. This technical approach {{does not take into account}} of the substrate’s composition and physical shape, both of which have proved to influence the fire initiation to a significant extent. With commercial RIP cigarettes currently sold in many jurisdictions implementing the RIP regulations, early fire statistical data give a mixed picture on the effectiveness of the RIP cigarettes in reducing real-life fire incidence, from up to 40 % of reduction in fire incidence to no significant effect. Importantly, it has shown no reported negative impact on fire risks so far. Fundamental research into the thermal physical interaction between RIP cigarettes and different substrate materials is still required to understand the effectiveness or the lack of it. The research outcome should also help to explore whether improved or alternative technology may become available. With smouldering cigarette – substrate systems sufficiently characterised, it is feasible that computer modelling may be deployed to simulate main fire initiation probabilities and highlight further opportunities to manage this risk. Regulators and fire prevention initiatives should continue their proven effective measures such as fire hazard education, fire alarm installation, fire escape route planning, etc, in addition to the implementation of RIP cigarette regulation.|$|E

The flexible rapier can be coiled as it is withdrawn, therefore requiring less storage space. If, however, the rapier is too stiff then it will not coil; If it is too flexible, it will buckle. Rigid and flexible rapier machines operate at speeds ranging from about 200 to 260 ppm, using up to 1,300 metres of weft yarn every minute.

40|$|Denna uppsats, vars första frö såddes vid ett studiebesök på Skokloster slott för två år sedan, behandlar barockens stoppningshistoria och en rekonstruktion av Skoklosterstolens stoppning. Målet med uppsatsen är att skapa ett intresse för historiska stoppningar och dess tekniker för både privatpersoner och yrkesmän. Undersökningar av litteratur, inventarielistor och Skoklosterstolarna själva ger anledning att tro att Skoklosterstolarna tillverkades 1708 till slottets dåvarande ägare Abraham Brahe. Som tidigare publicerats av Johan Knutsson finns det skäl att tro att stolarna tillverkats lokalt. Nya {{analyser}} presenteras i uppsatsen som styrker denna hypotes.
