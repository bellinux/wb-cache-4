40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} {{technique}} for motion estimation of groups of targets based on evolving graph networks. The main novelty over alternative group tracking techniques stems from learning the network {{structure for the}} groups. Each node of the graph corresponds to a target within the group. The uncertainty of the group structure is estimated jointly with the group target states. New group structure evolving models are proposed for automatic graph structure initialisation, incorporation of new nodes, <b>unexisting</b> nodes removal and the edge update. Both {{the state and the}} graph structure are updated based on range and bearing measurements. This evolving graph model is propagated combined with a sequential Monte Carlo framework able to cope with measurement origin uncertainty. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated over scenarios for group motion estimation in urban environments. Results with challenging scenarios with merging, splitting and crossing of groups are presented with high estimation accuracy. The performance of the algorithm is also evaluated and shown on real ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar data and in the presence of data origin uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study the {{expected}} height {{and some other}} qualities of the binary serach trees. We make the inquiry about the expected height by skewed trees and by the two probably best-known and most widely used variations of the balanced trees, it means the AVL and the red-black trees. In addition {{to the value of}} the expected height of the trees we found out the scatter of the tree heights and some other statistics. In this thesis we attach to experimental solution of the problems. We also write down all the theoretical results that were known to us. We focus especially on comparing the measured values with the theoretically counted results. We try to acquire as exact assessment as possible in the case of <b>unexisting</b> theoretical results. Besides we compare the di erences between the various trees. We measured speeds of the tree's generation only marginally. We also inquire the dependence on di erent kinds of enter data within the experiments, such as the sorted data or generated data from various sorts of division. We use the standard statistic methods for the interpretation of the results, especially the method of linear regression...|$|E
40|$|Com base na releitura lacaniana da sexualidade, vamos desenvolver nossa tese sobre o laço íntimo entre sexuação e invenção. A última teoria do real é condensada na fórmula que preside o último ensino de Lacan: "não há relação sexual". O sintoma é a única infração à regra de que não há simbólico no real. As posições subjetivas masculina e feminina são sintomas, suplências da relação sexual que não existe. Retomando os marcos principais do pensamento freudiano sobre a sexualidade à luz do último ensino de Lacan, vamos demonstrar a articulação entre o ato da invenção e gênese do parceiro-sinthoma. After we {{have pursued}} the Lacanian view of sexuality, we shall devellop our thesis on the {{intimate}} bond between sexuation and invention. The last theory of reality sums itself {{up in the}} formula that directs the last teaching of Lacan: "there is no sexual relation". The symptom is the only {{exception to the rule}} that states: the real is symbol-less. The male and female subjective positions are symptoms, supplements in the <b>unexisting</b> sexual relation. By resuming the main landmarks of Freudian thought on sexuality, in light of Lacan's last teaching, we shall demonstrate the articulation between the act of invention and the genesis of symptom-partner...|$|E
40|$|Collecting jokes on the Internet is {{becoming}} more and more useful, and one might say even unavoidable. The renewed nature of jokes (short, electronically distributed in addition to oral circulation, some jokes created only for electronic media (see Ellis 2001) etc) requires renewed methods for collecting and processing the data. Further than that, the Estonian Internet has some special advantages for collecting various folklore, including jokes. Few years after the WWW was established and began to grow, folk-lorists have used it as a source for their studies. Less frequent are meta-studies that analyse the theoretical concepts and practical problems are involved in this new line on research. Guidelines for this type of folkloristic research are yet <b>unexisting.</b> This brief over-view does not attempt to do that, either, but points to the necessity to start forming and discussing the guidelines. Humour and jokes in particular are a good starting-point for this discussion because in a way humour is a „founding member “ of the Internet. The Internet was created as a means of serious communication, but became popu-lar mostly due to its entertaining nature. But the biggest enter-tainer, as we all know, is humour and its various forms of appear-ance. The internet owns its social nature and exponential growth mainly to the playful and entertaining atmosphere generated by humour (see Kirschenblatt 1996). The Internet holds basically two types of research material: static and dynamic. The static material lacks the social clues of immedi-ate interaction. These clues are otherwise quite inherent in the Internet that claims to be a new form of orality (Ong 1988). Of course the wider social background is still there, but features of interactivity mostly missing. It is cumulative and (if the site-owner or adminis-trator still maintains it) all the once added material is accessible at any later point of time. The dynamic material is interactive, ie chatroom-type joke portals. But also this, as does the static mate-rial, retains its history and is thus almost like live conversation bu...|$|E
40|$|Même quand on a réussi à réduire au minimum le travail nécessaire à la {{fabrication}} d'un produit, il subsiste encore de nombreux points qui sont autant de sources de temps perdu, sur lesquelles le travailleur a peu de prise, mais que par de bonnes méthodes de gestion et d'organisation la direction peut en partie éliminer. The {{passage of}} the traditional society where agriculture was the main activity to our large industrial societies gave an economic value {{to the notion of}} time. To win a second in a work process is very economic and is almost always translated in a cost reduction. The worker is often, if not always, held responsible for reducing or increasing the time of work necessary for the fabrication of a certain commodity. But a deeper study shows the falsity of such an assertion and that the worker has in fact less and less control over his working methods. Managers and management, however, are responsible for about two thirds of overtime periods (due to the fact a poor study of the product or its fabrication) and of idle time during which no real work is accomplished. Both overtime and idle time are also due to the excessive variety of product and, to lack of standardization in the changes of models. Thus causing stoppages due to small lot production and frequent adjustment of machines [...] . Overtime and idle time are also caused on the one hand by a bad planning of work and of orders resulting in a lack of raw materials, {{and on the other hand}} by breakdowns and installations in bad conditions causing stoppages for both men and materials and thus a certain waste. In addition to this, in small firms, personnel policies are not sufficient, even often <b>unexisting.</b> Too often managers live and work in pure routine without even thinking of reconsidering their conception of work and their methods. One will find in a study of the International Labor Bureau that the time of work really necessary in the execution of an operation does not exceed one third of the total existing working time...|$|E
40|$|For most of {{the global}} population, {{biomedicine}} is de facto insufficient, unaffordable or simply <b>unexisting.</b> At the same time, health and healing (whether western biomedicine, or African ways of healing) are always part of a historical and socio-cultural context; {{it is precisely this}} cultural embeddedness that endows these healing traditions with their efficacy. The first chapter offers a limited introduction to the problem of healing and health in the context of Africa south of the Sahara. The second deals with some aspects of the culture-specific meaning of healing and of being healed. It sketches some of the main lines along which the so-called 'traditional' healing cultures in South-Saharan Africa are structured, and introduces some of the aspects of the socio-cultural context in which the traditional-African etiology of illness and misfortune is embedded. Both biomedicine and African healing traditions are characterised by a more profound and culture-specific rationality that surfaces in the therapy offered by the healer {{as well as in the}} behaviour of the patient. Chapter three illustrates and argues that biomedicine was embedded in and closely intertwined with a political and socio-economical, exploitative context of colonisation. It deals with biomedicine's failure in attaining its main goal -being the elimination of epidemics and the spread of contagious disease or the eradication of 'the enemies of mankind'. A fourth chapter explores how biomedicine played a major role in constructing the self-image of Europe and the West through projecting its negation on "the black body", and this up to the present. Chapter five, in contrast, deals with the period following Independence, when a new elite took over. Biomedicine became an important tool both in the emancipation from exploitation on the one, and away from the 'traditional' ways on the other hand. Traditional life was thought of as backward and ignorant -constructed as the negation of a 'future made white'. Economical development and technological innovation offered a way out of ignorance, poverty and disease. The apparent failure of this project (the inefficiency and ineffectivity of large-scale and vertical eradication programs and the particular problems biomedicine, for example in Africa, was dealing with) gave rise to the Alma Ata conference in 1978, that introduced an ideological revolution in the international discourse and conceptualisation of health and healing; looking with hindsight it however failed to bring about the result it initially promised ('health for all by the year 2000 ') -one of the reasons being the dominance of a western paradigm, that for example reduced the relevance of African healing to herbal knowledge. Moreover, the integration of various healing tradition did not have to be invented, as it already existed (and still does) in the daily praxis of health seeking behaviour. A sixth chapter tries to answer the question what biomedicine might mean in the current context of deprivation and violence that has hit hard upon many African countries and regions, when institutions and the state are by no means capable of fulfilling the role they were destined for, or when they have renounced it? What is within the powers of biomedicine if everyday life is guided by "the politics of the belly", when the so-called formal economy has de facto ceased to exist? This book offers a general introduction to the complex domain of healing and of being healed. Taking an anthropological stance, it aims at laying bare the assumptions that commonly mold both lay expectations when we venture in 'otherness' or strangeness, and the image-building and imagery among professionals (practicioners, health care workers, [...] .). Simultaneously, it highlights the dynamics and creativity as an inherent capacity of 'culture', its inventivity and flexibility, but its contextuality as well. The book is mainly written for a non-anthropological audience, and introduces the reader into the broad and dispersed field of especially Anglo-Saxon literature on this wide-ranging topic. edition: 1 stnrpages: 133 status: publishe...|$|E
