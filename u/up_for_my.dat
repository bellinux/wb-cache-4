500|$|The {{game was}} made {{available}} for download on April 20, 2005, the sixth anniversary of the Columbine massacre. Ledonne sought to remain anonymous at the game's debut to avoid any possible controversy, which he would later regret as it created the impression {{he had something to}} hide. Under the alias [...] "Columbin", Ledonne regularly engaged gamers and critics alike on a message board he established to discuss the game's depiction of the shooting and the broader implications of the shooting. Ledonne's identity was revealed by Roger Kovacs, a friend of one of the Columbine victims, Rachel Scott. Kovacs found out Ledonne's name by donating to the site via Paypal; after his name and address were posted online, Ledonne stepped forward and was greeted with requests for interviews. [...] "That's when I decided that I had to grow a backbone and stand <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> creation," [...] Ledonne said.|$|E
2500|$|The bully panel: In {{this panel}} Kurelek {{represents}} himself being beaten up and bloodied by a macho bully. It {{is not an}} actual memory but something he always feared. In the foreground are a boy pointing and smiling and a girl watching. This is more grounded in memory, for Kurelek writes, [...] "The girls who tormented me especially rejoiced when I was knocked down for trying to stand <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Father Almighty, {{you have}} brought my wanderings to an end; now enable me {{to begin this}} work. For who am I, Lord, that I should build a house to name? If I rely on myself, it will be of no avail, but it is you who will assist me. You have given me {{the desire to be}} a builder; make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> lack of skill, and bring the work of {{building}} this holy house to its completion." ...|$|E
50|$|Translation: When the Pleiades fall, I wake <b>up</b> looking <b>for</b> <b>my</b> {{goatskin}} bag to drink. When (the Pleiades) rise, I wake <b>up</b> looking <b>for</b> a {{cloth to}} wear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, he's quite {{at home at}} that work! He drew <b>up</b> five, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> five sisters, {{and thereby}} ruined my father's property, and my prospects." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> it, <b>my</b> dear," [...] {{the young}} man answered, giving her chin--a very charming, rotund, little chin--a {{friendly}} whisk with his forefinger.|$|R
2500|$|Jones {{has engaged}} in a fierce war of words with Warrington Borough Council on {{numerous}} occasions, beginning when she obtained emails that revealed the council's Chief Executive had explored the possibility of legal action against her following an Adjournment Debate in the Commons (where Jones had accused the council of failing to answer her letters on concerns raised by Warrington North constituents). Jones [...] condemned the council's threat as a [...] "waste of time and money", reminding them that any comments made in the House enjoy legal protection. She claimed that the council's threat to sue her for defamation [...] "raised questions about the competence" [...] of council officers. Jones responded to the threat in the Liverpool Daily Post by stating: [...] "Maybe they think it will shut me up – but it won't. I will continue to speak <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> constituents." ...|$|E

5000|$|... 'Take <b>up</b> {{the mare}} <b>for</b> <b>my</b> father's gift—by God, she has carried a man!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, for {{the first}} helping. And don't offer to cut it <b>up</b> <b>for</b> me! <b>My</b> proud spirit draws the line at cutting up. Besides, a fork will do the work with goulash." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Weel, I did {{not pass}} quite close to them, as I ran <b>up</b> here <b>for</b> <b>my</b> horse on hearin' the news," [...] replied Duncan; [...] "but I am pretty sure that I saw her sittin' beside Louise." ...|$|R
6000|$|And I had {{hunted down}} Jack {{for the crime}} I had {{committed}} myself! I had threatened to give him <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> own dreadful parricide! ...|$|E
6000|$|Gilbert and Lucy both uttered an exclamation; and Sophy added, 'She {{would have}} so much more {{enjoyment}} than I could! Oh, it would quite make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> missing it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! but {{she will}} write to my husband, and he will take me from you, {{and that would be}} dreadful. Give it up. Oh, Marguerite, give it <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>MY</b> sake!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can send}} the car <b>up</b> here <b>for</b> <b>my</b> things, {{and have it}} pick me up at the Inn, if you'll say goodbye to them for me, afterwards. We'll walk down the line, then we shan't meet anyone." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'My merit. What is it? Old bag {{of bones}} making curries {{for men who}} do not ask [...] "Who cooked this?" [...] Now if it were stored <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> grandson--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{dare you}} say I lie?" [...] demanded Lucy. [...] "I've {{a mind to}} {{turn my back on}} you. I'm trying to make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> blunder and you--you insult me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They cannot {{have been}} sitting long," [...] cried Mrs. Grant, [...] "for when I went <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> shawl I saw them from the {{staircase}} window, {{and then they were}} walking." ...|$|E
60|$|CRAVEN. That's true. I didn't {{think of}} that. I beg your pardon, Paramore: I'll never {{say another word}} against your profession.

6000|$|... "Here, citizen Mole, I want you! There's {{not a bit}} of wood chopped <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> fire, and how am I to {{make the}} coffee without firing, I should like to know?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I wouldn't reg'larly do her <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> board; but I was thinkin' perhaps she'd {{have work}} enough so's we could pay our way. You come pretty near squarin' things when you tackled the burglar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{inclined}} to think so," [...] Andrew replied with some severity. [...] "Still, I haven't seen him since the meeting. It's fortunate I know of a partner who'll make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> deficiencies--I mean our old accountant, Sharpe." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is {{very kind}} of you to ask me," [...] he said. [...] "Don't think me churlish, but I go nowhere. I am trying to make <b>up,</b> you see, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> years of idleness." ...|$|R
