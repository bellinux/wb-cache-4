40|$|Easter Island (Chile) is a {{volcanic}} island made up entirely of volcanic rocks, which {{are represented by}} lava flows and domes as well as cinder and scoria pyroclastic cones, covering the entire compositional range from basalts to peralkaline rhyolites. Apart from representing a cultural heritage of worldwide importance, the megalithic Moai statues of Easter Island are an exquisite example of the utilisation {{of a variety of}} volcanic rocks in sculpture. This work illustrates the spectrum of volcanic litho-types available to the islanders through new chemical and petrographic data and presents chemical, mineralogical, petrographic and physical data on the rocks from the same volcanic deposits used for fashioning the megalithic sculptures. The stones used for the statues and their topknots are represented by volcanic rocks with different depositional mechanisms and chemical compositions. They include tuffs deposited in water, subaerial welded scoriae, lava flows and lava domes, with compositions ranging from basalt to trachyte. Despite such variations, they all share rather high total porosity, and are all easily workable stones. Their low apparent density seems to be the critical factor in enabling such large statues to be fashioned. The rest of the volcanic rocks on the island were unsuitable for building megalithic sculptures for various reasons: they are either too heavy, as is the case of the basaltic lavas, or too fragile, as the obsidian, or too loose, as the <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>tuff</b> and scoria cones. The rocks used for the platforms and altars are lavas whose compositions vary moderately, from basaltic to mugearitic, but which share similar physical and mechanical properties, well suited to building stable bases for the statues. The results of the study on the Rano Raraku tuff, employed in the great majority of the statues, show that it consists of a hyalotuff, in which volcanic glass was altered by interaction with sea water. The products of alteration vary in composition from nearly amorphous palagonite to crystalline smectite. The magma that erupted at Rano Raraku was originally mugearitic, and the high loss on ignition (LOI) and low alkali content of the rock, as well as its high clay content, are characteristics stemming from glass-sea water interactions during the deposit formation. The samples taken from the base, middle and top of the cone flank hosting the quarries show very similar composition of the bulk rock, the fresh glass and the palagonite products, suggesting homogeneous rock characteristics throughout the quarries...|$|E
40|$|The Johnson River {{prospect}} on the Alaskan peninsula is {{an unusually}} well preserved Jurassic example of gold-rich sea-floor mineralization accompanied byextensive anhydrite. The prospect is a gold-zinc-copper-lead deposit {{located within the}} dominantly dacitic middle portion of the lower Jurassic Talkeetna Formation, a complex succession ofunmetamorphosed volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks. The mineralization at the Johnson prospect forms a discordant quartz-sulfide stockwork body {{in a series of}} subaqueous tuffs and debris flows. The mineralization and alteration can be divided into an early, pervasive nodular anhydrite-Mg chlorite-clay-sericite stage essentially barren of base metals and gold and a later quartz-sulfide gold stage associated with barite, Fe chlorite, sericite, and vein-type anhydrite. The abundance of sulfate far exceeds that of total sulfide at the Johnson River prospect. The an-hydrite-bearing assemblages form a stratigraphically restricted zone in which anhydrite may constitute up to 80 percent of the rock. Textures indicating both replacement of fragments by anhydrite, and more commonly, open-space growth ofanhydrite can probably be explained by anhydrite precipitation in highly porous <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>tuffs.</b> Early sulfide and oxide min...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The Virgin Valley-McGee Mountain area {{is located}} in the {{northwest}} corner of Nevada in the northwestern part of the Basin and Range structural province. Rocks within the area consist predominantly of Miocene to Pleistocene volcanic rocks and volcanic derived sedimentary rocks. The volcanic rocks include rhyolite, rhyolite welded tuffs, and basalt. Sedimentary rocks are volcanic conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, and mudstones with subordinate amounts of diatomite, lignite, opaline chert, and volcanic <b>tuff.</b> <b>Unconsolidated</b> deposits include Quaternary alluvium, landslide debris, and playa sediments. The entire sequence is 2200 Â± feet thick. Rock units within the thesis area can be correlated with units of the same age throughout northeastern California, northwestern Nevada, central and southern Oregon, and western Idaho. The principal structural features within the area are the Virgin Valley syncline, Big Mountain-McGee Mountain anticline, and the tilted fault-block mountain that gives rise to the Big Mountain- McGee Mountain complex. The deformation that produced the broad, gentle folds and fault-block mountain were part of the Basin and Range orogeny. The episode of greatest faulting occurred during Pleistocene time, producing the present features of the Basin and Range structure within the thesis area and the surrounding region...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The thesis area {{consists}} of 33 square {{miles in the}} south-central Pueblo Mountains of Humboldt County, Nevada and Harney County, Oregon. The Pueblo Mountains are tilted fault block mountains found in the extreme northwestern part of the Basin and Range province and were produced during Early Tertiary Basin and Range orogeny. Northwest and northeast trending faults of Late Tertiary time have since cut the entire stratigraphic sequence. The oldest rocks exposed are metamorphosed Permian to Triassic eugeosynclinal sedimentary rocks. The metamorphic sequence is intruded by several granitic plutons of Late Jurassic to Middle Cretaceous age. A thick sequence of Miocene basalt flows unconformably overlies the pre- Tertiary rocks. A slight angular unconformity separates the basalt sequence from overlying Miocene tuffaceous sedimentary rocks, sillar flows, and welded <b>tuffs.</b> <b>Unconsolidated</b> deposits of Quaternary alluvium include alluvial fan and lacustrine sediments. Mineralization within the area includes several gold prospects, a mercury prospect, and a possible copper deposit. The copper prospect {{consists of}} a large gossan (6, 000 feet by 3, 000 feet). Mineralization and alteration from a Cretaceous porphyritic quartz monzonite intrusion has produced potassic and quartz sericite hydrothermal alteration in the host. Oxidation and weathering has removed the sulfides from the surface leaving goethite, hematite, and limonite residues...|$|R
40|$|Tofua Island is an oval, steep-sided {{composite}} volcano, 5 miles by 6 {{miles in}} diameter, {{the summit of}} which has collapsed to form a caldera. Within the caldera, Lofia cone is still active. Four unit s have been mapped: (1) the Hamatua Formation, of precaldera age, includes basaltic andesites, pyroxene andesit es, and pyroxene dacites; (2) the Hokula Froth Lava, a microvesiculated lava flow of andesite; (3) the Kolo Formation, composed of air-laid lapilli tuff-breccia, <b>tuff,</b> <b>unconsolidated</b> ash and cinder, small basaltic andesite lava flows, and one thick pyroxene andesite lava flow; and (4) the Lofia Formation, composed of air-laid tuff, ash, basaltic andesite lava flows, and andesite lava flows. An erosional unconformity separates the Hamatua Formation from the Hokula Froth Lava, and another lies between the froth lava and the Kolo Formation. The rocks are typical orogenic andesites and related types, unusually high in CaO, which {{is reflected in the}} calcic nature of the plagioclase. The pyroxenes of the groundmass are usually pigeonite and pigeonitic augite, whereas the phenocrysts are augite. Hypersthene is less common and occurs only as phenocrysts surrounded by reaction rims of pigeonite and/or pigeonitic augite. Concentric normal faults associated with caldera collapse are common on the northern, eastern, and southern rims of the caldera. Some of the faults have served as conduits for rising magma of the Kolo Formation; others, on which caldera collapse is continuing, do not exhibit associated volcanism. Tensional cracks are abundant along the southern rim...|$|R
