30|$|Cherkasova and Phaal [14] {{proposed}} an SBAC approach {{that uses the}} traditional on-off control. It supports four admission control strategies: responsive, stable, hybrid, and predictive. The hybrid strategy tunes itself to be more stable or more responsive based on the observed QoS. The proposed approach measures server <b>utilizations</b> during predefined time intervals. Using these measured <b>utilizations,</b> it computes predicted <b>utilizations</b> for the next interval. If the predicted <b>utilizations</b> exceed specified thresholds, the admission controller rejects all new sessions in the next time interval and only serves the requests from already admitted sessions. Once the predicted <b>utilizations</b> drop below the given thresholds, the server changes its policy for the next time interval and begins to admit new sessions again.|$|R

25|$|The next {{pillar of}} food {{security}} is food <b>utilization,</b> {{which refers to}} the metabolism of food by individuals. Once food is obtained by a household, {{a variety of factors}} affect {{the quantity and quality of}} food that reaches members of the household. In order to achieve food security, the food ingested must be safe and must be enough to meet the physiological requirements of each individual. Food safety affects food <b>utilization,</b> and can be affected by the preparation, processing, and cooking of food in the community and household. Nutritional values of the household determine food choice, and whether food meets cultural preferences is important to <b>utilization</b> in terms of psychological and social well-being. Access to healthcare is another determinant of food <b>utilization,</b> since the health of individuals controls how the food is metabolized. For example, intestinal parasites can take nutrients from the body and decrease food <b>utilization.</b> Sanitation can also decrease the occurrence and spread of diseases that can affect food <b>utilization.</b> Education about nutrition and food preparation can affect food <b>utilization</b> and improve this pillar of food security.|$|E
