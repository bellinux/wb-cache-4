The dependencies of the stored energy value on the irradiation temperature {{and the presence of}} dopants have been studied. Irradiation experiments at controlled temperatures between 50 and 150 degrees C and doses <b>up</b> to 150 <b>Grad</b> have been carried out. For pure NaCl we have found that the damage is formed only in a relatively narrow range of irradiation temperatures. In almost all cases the effect of doping is that the stored energy value is larger and the temperature range where stored energy develops is wider as compared to pure NaCl...|$|R

40|$|New {{experimental}} {{results are presented}} on low temperature irradiation (18 ◦C) of rock-salt samples which {{had been exposed to}} initial doses <b>up</b> to 320 <b>GRad</b> at 100 ◦C. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) shows that the latent heat of melting (LHM) of sodium colloids decreases during subsequent low-temperature irradiation, whereas the stored energy (SE) increases slowly, indicating that the process of radiolysis continues. The decrease of the LHM is due to dissolution of large colloids, because the intensities of the melting peaks decrease during the second stage irradiation at low temperature. The model is formulated to describe the nucleation kinetics and the evolution of the size distribution of chlorine precipitates and sodium colloids in NaCl under high dose irradiation. It is shown that the mechanism of dissolution of large Na colloids during low temperature irradiation can be related to melting of sodium colloids. 1...|$|R

Two such applications are {{the use of}} permanent magnetic lenses for accelerator and beam transport systems, and the expanding use in undulators and wigglers ef synchrotron radiation and free electron laser systems. Both applications involve potential exposure of REPMs to high radiation fields.

40|$|In the ALICE {{experiment}} at Cern LHC, {{a set of}} hadron calorimeters will be used {{to determine}} the centrality of the Pb-Pb collision. The spectator protons and neutrons, will be separated from the ion beams, using the separator magnet (D 1) of the LHC beam optics and respectively detected by a proton (ZP) and a neutron (ZN) "Zero-degree Calorimeter" (ZDC). The detectors will be placed in front of the separator D 2 magnet, 115 meters away from the beam intersection point. The ZDCs are quartz-fiber spaghetti calorimeters that exploit the Cherenkov light produced by the shower particles in silica optical fibers. This technique offers the advantages of high radiation hardness (<b>up</b> to several <b>Grad),</b> fast response and reduced lateral dimension of the detectable shower. In addition, quartz-fiber calorimeters are intrinsically insensitive to radio-activation background, which produces particles below the Cherenkov threshold. The ALICE ZDC should have an energy resolution comparable with the intrinsic energy fluctuations, which range from about 20 0. 000000 or central events to about 5 0. 000000 or peripheral ones, according to simulations that use HIJING as event generator. The fiber-to-absorber filling ratio must be chosen as a good compromise between the required energy resolution and the fiber cost. The design of the proposed calorimeter will be discussed, together with the expected performances. Whenever possible, the simulated results will be compared with the experimental ones, obtained with the built prototypes and with the NA 50 ZDC, which can be considered as a working prototype for the ALICE neutron calorimeter...|$|R
40|$|The report {{contains}} {{various aspects}} of radiation damage in silicon detectors subjected to high intensity hadron and electromagnetic irradiation. It focuses on improvements for the foreseen LHC applications, employing oxygenation of silicon wafers during detector processing (result from CERN-RD 48). An updated survey on hadron induced damage is given in the first article. Several improvements are outlined especially with respect to antiannealing problems associated with detector storage during LHC maintenance periods. Open questions are outlined in the final section, among which are {{a full understanding of}} differences found between proton and neutron induced damage, process related effects changing the radiation tolerance in addition to the oxygen content and the lack of understanding the changed detector properties on the basis of damage induced point and cluster defects. In addition to float zone silicon, so far entirely used for detector fabrication,Czochralski silicon was also studied and first promising results are shown. The other three papers deal with gamma induced damage including also defects introduced either by processing steps or being inherent to the as grown silicon. However the focus is on measurements after gamma irradiation in a wide dose range. Both the changes in detector properties and defect characterisations have been studied. For the first time it is shown that in contrast to a standard process oxygenated silicon detectors withstand an irradiation dose of <b>up</b> to 1 <b>Grad</b> with only minor deterioration. Also it is shown {{for the first time that}} in this case the detector properties can directly be explained by the damage induced point defects. This 1 : 1 correlation is extremely promising for all future defect engineering work. Comment: 35 pages, 41 figures, To be published in Nuclear Instruments and Methods...|$|R
40|$|The High Luminosity {{run of the}} Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), {{foreseen}} {{to start}} in 2026, will increase the delivered luminosity by roughly {{an order of magnitude}} compared to its original design, allowing to collect a statistics of about 3000 fb^(- 1). This large amount of data will consent a deeper study of the Standard Model of particle physics, searching for physics beyond it. In order to sustain the high collision rate and higher radiation doses, as well as to increase the precise reconstruction of the charged track trajectories, a new Silicon Pixel detector will be installed in the CMS experiment. This will guarantee better impact parameter measurements to detect b-quarks and tau-leptons from the top-quark and Higgs-boson decays, which are believed to offer the best opportunities to investigate physics beyond the Standard Model. Such an improved Silicon Pixel detector will require unprecedented radiation tolerance (<b>up</b> to 1 <b>Grad)</b> and should offer "intelligent" data processing in the front-end chip, while keeping low power and low material budget. The readout chip will be developed in planar 65 nm technology. This {{is the first time that}} this technology will be used in High-Energy physics experiments, due to the complexity of the rules for designing the analogue and digital circuitries: it is more radiation tolerant and less power hungry with respect to technologies used so far and allows to develop more logic in the device area. This thesis describes the impact of the foreseen upgraded Silicon Pixel detector on the physics of CMS at HL-LHC through the precise measurement of charged track trajectories, by the reduction of the material budget using less readout cables through lossless data compression algorithms embedded in the pixel readout chip. The outcome is not only the reduction of the material budget due to the reduction of the number of cables, but also the further transmission stages can be reduced improving the power consumption of the silicon detector. Two lossless data compression techniques are studied, based on Huffman and arithmetic coding. The selection of these encoding methods was established by the implementation requirements. The data compression should be as simple as possible to avoid complex designs that lead to big and power consuming circuitry. In addition the compression should be very fast due to the very high readout rate of 750 MHz. The results give various solutions with compression ratios ranging between 1. 2 and 2. 9 depending on the implementation complexity.

40|$|CHIPIX 65 -FE 0 is a readout ASIC in CMOS 65 nm {{designed}} by the CHIPIX 65 project for a pixel detector at the HL-LHC, consisting of a matrix of 64 x 64 pixels of dimension 50 x 50 μm 2. It is fully functional, can work at low thresholds down to 250 e− and satisfies all the specifications. Results confirm low-noise, fast performance of both the synchronous and asynchronous front-end in a complex digital chip. CHIPIX 65 -FE 0 has been irradiated up to 600 Mrad and is only marginally affected on analog performance. Further irradiation to 1 Grad will be performed. Bump bonding to silicon sensors is now on going and detailed measurements will be presented. The HL-LHC accelerator will constitute a new frontier for particle physics after year 2024. One major experimental challenge resides in the inner tracking detectors, measuring particle position: here the dimension of the sensitive area (pixel) has to be scaled down with respect to LHC detectors. This paper describes the results obtained by CHIPIX 65 -FE 0, a readout ASIC in CMOS 65 nm {{designed by}} the CHIPIX 65 project as small-scale demonstrator for a pixel detector at the HL-LHC. It consists of a matrix of 64 x 64 pixels of dimension 50 x 50 um 2 pixels and contains several pieces that are included in RD 53 A, a large scale ASIC {{designed by the}} RD 53 Collaboration: {{two out of three}} front-ends (a synchronous and an asynchronous architecture); several building blocks; a (4 x 4) pixel region digital architecture with central local buffer storage, complying with a 3 GHz/cm 2 hit rate and a 1 MHz trigger rate maintaining a very high efficiency (above 99 %). The chip is 100 % functional, either running in triggered or trigger-less mode. All building-blocks (DAC, ADC, Band Gap, SER, sLVS-TX/RX) and very front ends are working as expected. Analog performance shows a remarkably low ENC of 90 e-, a fast-rise time below 25 ns and low-power consumption (about 4 μA/pixel) in both synchronous and asynchronous front-ends; a very linear behavior of CSA and discriminator. No significant cross talk from digital electronics has been measured, achieving a low threshold of 250 e-. Signal digitization is obtained with a 5 b-Time over Threshold technique and is shown to be fairly linear, working well either at 80 MHz or with higher frequencies of 300 MHz obtained with a tunable local oscillator. Irradiation results up to 600 Mrad at low temperature (- 20 °C) show that the chip is still fully functional and analog performance is only marginally degraded.
