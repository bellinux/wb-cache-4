40|$|Wong (2003) purports that {{it takes}} between five and seven years to develop an {{effective}} teacher, yet the attrition rate of teachers in <b>urban</b> <b>schools</b> implies that over half the teachers leave before they are fully developed.

This study examines critical components that cause teachers to remain teaching in <b>urban</b> <b>schools</b> past the five year attrition mark. The results of this qualitative study indicate the need for school leaders to draw from occupational research and provide environments in which teachers are supported and regarded as valued decision-makers in their schools. The results reveal the importance of human relationships in the retention and growth of urban teachers...|$|R

The white student body decreased, while the Hispanic student body increased and became HISD's largest student demographic in the 1989-1990 school year. In 1975 the student body was 39% White and 19% Hispanic. In 1981 the district had 190,000 students; 31% of the district's students were Hispanic, and 21% were White. In 1990 the student body was 43% Hispanic, 40% Black, and 15% White. At the time 45% of HISD schools had no white students.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this study was to explore the {{perceptions}} of Black middle and upper class preservice teachers as they relate to teaching and learning in high poverty <b>urban</b> <b>schools.</b> Participants included 11 senior early childhood education preservice teachers at a historically Black college in the southeast region of the United States. The study was conducted using qualitative inquiry. Background questionnaires, individual interviews, and a group interview served as the data sources. While there is an extensive body of knowledge focused on the increasing number of White preservice teachers who lack experience with students in diverse communities, there are limited studies pertaining to the perceptions of Black middle and upper class preservice teachers who may lack experience with students in high poverty <b>urban</b> <b>schools.</b> In the Black community, color and social class have been inexorably linked for generations. Social class is conceivably one of the most significant sources of inequality in schools and was one of the first factors, after intelligence, researched by scholars as a source of difference in achievement. The study answered the following questions: (1) What are the perceptions of Black middle and upper class preservice teachers regarding teaching and learning in high poverty <b>urban</b> <b>schools?</b> (2) To what extent do Black middle and upper class preservice teachers believe they can be successful teachers in high poverty <b>urban</b> <b>schools?</b> The data demonstrated that Black middle and upper class preservice teachers (a) prefer to teach in communities similar to their own school experiences; (b) believe students from high poverty <b>urban</b> <b>schools</b> can achieve at the same level as students in middle and upper class schools, but are uncertain of the value their informal knowledge brings to the classroom; (c) recognize effective teaching strategies and best practices in classroom instruction; and (d) have mixed feelings regarding their ability to connect with students and parents in high poverty <b>urban</b> <b>schools.</b> Implications from the study include expanding the scope of field experiences for Black middle and upper class preservice teachers in high poverty <b>urban</b> <b>schools</b> and recognizing Black middle and upper class preservice teachers in teacher education research...|$|R
