40|$|We {{wanted to}} {{establish}} whether strand breaks and gaps, arising during {{the removal of}} uracil from newly-synthesized DNA, can be utilized as strand discrimination signals by the methyl-directed mismatch repair system of Escherichia coli. For this purpose, we constructed a series of M 13 heteroduplexes that contained a single uracil residue situated either upstream or downstream from a G/T or an A/C mispair. Transfections of these constructs into E. coli strains, either proficient of deficient in mismatch or <b>uracil</b> <b>repair,</b> allowed us to follow the fate of these mispairs in vivo. Our data show that the intermediates of <b>uracil</b> <b>repair</b> cannot substitute for the strand-discrimination signals generated by the MutH protein, which is thought to initiate the methyl-directed mismatch repair process by nicking the unmethylated strand of a newly-synthesized DNA duplex at d(GATC) sites.

40|$|My study aims at {{determining}} if DNA-PKcs, a NHEJ factor, and REC 8, a cohesin {{that facilitates}} HDR, contribute to SHM. Although my {{data do not}} support their participation in SHM in mouse B cells, I discovered that Rec 8 -/- mice had slightly lower red cell and platelet counts. Moreover, Rec 8 -/- bone marrow cells competed poorly when put into competition with Rec 8 +/+ bone marrow cells, and this defect {{can be traced to}} the earliest haematopoietic progenitors. I also discovered that Rec 8 -/- mice carry an unexpected one base-pair deletion in the adjacent Ipo 4 gene, resulting in undetectable IPO 4 protein level in Rec 8 -/- MEFs. Since REC 8 is a meiotic protein with no established function in mitotic cells, the above mentioned defects are probably due to IPO 4 deficiency. Next part of my study was to test whether SMUG 1 participates in antibody mutation. Di Noia et al. (2006) showed that SMUG 1 transgenic over-expression reduced SHM. My study is to confirm this observation using retroviral transduction, with UNG 2 as a control. My results suggest that over-expression of either ecotopic SMUG 1 or UNG 2 enhances faithful BER, with only subtly different SHM phenotypes. Therefore I concluded that the previously proposed higher fidelity of SMUG 1 -mediated <b>uracil</b> <b>repair</b> relative to UNG 2 -mediated <b>uracil</b> <b>repair</b> has been over-stated.

40|$|<b>Uracil</b> {{excision}} <b>repair</b> is {{ubiquitous in}} all domains {{of life and}} initiated by uracil DNA glycosylases (UDGs) which excise the promutagenic base, uracil, from DNA to leave behind an abasic site (AP-site). Repair of the resulting AP-sites requires an AP-endonuclease, a DNA polymerase, and a DNA ligase whose combined activities result in either short-patch or long-patch repair. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, has {{an increased risk of}} accumulating uracils because of its G + C-rich genome, and its niche inside host macrophages where it is exposed to reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, two major causes of cytosine deamination (to uracil) in DNA. In vitro assays to study DNA repair in this important human pathogen are limited. To study <b>uracil</b> excision <b>repair</b> in mycobacteria, we have established assay conditions using cell-free extracts of M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis (a fast-growing mycobacterium) and oligomer or plasmid DNA substrates. We show that in mycobacteria, <b>uracil</b> excision <b>repair</b> is completed primarily via long-patch repair. In addition, we show that M. tuberculosis UdgB, a newly characterized family 5 UDG, substitutes for the highly conserved family 1 UDG, Ung, thereby suggesting that UdgB might function as backup enzyme for <b>uracil</b> excision <b>repair</b> in mycobacteria.

40|$|The {{generalized}} {{mismatch repair}} system of Streptococcus pneumoniae (the Hex system) can eliminate base pair mismatches arising in heteroduplex DNA during transformation or by DNA polymerase errors during replication. Mismatch repair {{is most likely}} initiated at nicks or gaps. The present work was started to examine the hypothesis that strand discontinuities arising after removal of uracil by uracil DNA-glycosylase (Ung) can be utilised as strand discrimination signals. We show that mismatch repair efficiency is enhanced 3 - to 6 -fold when using uracil-containing DNA as donor in transformation. In order to assess the contribution of Ung to nascent strand discrimination for postreplication mismatch repair, we developed a positive selection procedure to isolate S. pneumoniae Ung- mutants. We succeeded in isolating Ung- mutants using this procedure based on chromosomal integration of uracil-containing hybrid DNA molecules. Cloning and characterization of the ung gene was achieved. Comparison of spontaneous mutation rates in strains either proficient or deficient in mismatch and/or <b>uracil</b> <b>repair</b> gave no support to the hypothesis that Ung {{plays a major role}} in targeting the Hex system to neosynthesized DNA strands.

40|$|The genetic {{information}} {{stored in the}} DNA is constantly threatened by DNA damage and genetic transactions that generate torsional stress and replication stalling. Thus, a variety of DNA surveillance and repair mechanisms cooperate to ensure DNA stability. DNA replication forks (RFs) are frequently blocked by different obstacles, such as programmed RF barriers (RFBs) found in many organisms. The well-studied ribosomal RFB (rRFB) of budding yeast requires binding of Fob 1 for its activity, a protein that {{is important for the}} stability of the highly repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Fob 1 also mediates the reported anchoring of the rDNA repeats to the inner nuclear membrane. The resulting restricted structural flexibility creates a great amount of torsional stress, which is normally removed by DNA topoisomerases that cut the DNA by forming a covalent intermediate to allow for DNA relaxation before re-ligation. Indeed, topoisomerases are important for rDNA stability and topoisomerase 1 (Top 1) -dependent nicks were mapped close to the rRFB. As it remained elusive how Top 1 action is regulated in the rDNA, the first aim of my thesis was the identification of factors influencing Top 1 nicking activity within the rDNA and particularly at the rRFB in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. I found that Top 1 -DNA complexes (Top 1 cleavage complexes, Top 1 ccs) and, thus, DNA nicks are stabilized at the rRFB. Top 1 cc accumulation requires Fob 1 and the nucleolar protein Tof 2, but not RF stalling. Interestingly, Top 1 cc stabilization by Fob 1 and Tof 2 does not require the rDNA context, as Fob 1 -dependent Top 1 ccs also accumulated at an ectopically located rRFB that was neither recruited to the nucleolus nor to the inner nuclear membrane. We also identified Top 1 nicks to account for most of the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) previously described to arise in wild-type cells, pointing at an in vitro conversion of single-stranded Top 1 nicks to DSBs. On the basis of these data, we propose a model in which Top 1 is recruited to the rRFB, where it nicks the DNA forming a stable Top 1 cc intermediate to allow for continuous relaxation, thereby contributing to the genetic stabilization of the structurally complex locus. This stabilization would be achieved by protein-protein interactions with Fob 1 and Tof 2 or by misalignment of the break end by the structure of the complex. In the published manuscript we thus present first evidence for locus-specific regulation of Top 1 catalytic actions. Besides regulating DNA torsion and ensuring RF integrity, genome maintenance also involves the removal of irregular DNA bases. Uracil deriving from cytosine deamination or uracil misincorporation during DNA replication is excised by uracil DNA glycosylases (UDGs) to initiate base excision repair (BER) that restores the correct base pair. In mammals, four nuclear UDGs with partially overlapping functions are expressed. While UNG 2 and SMUG 1 were mainly associated with “classical” uracil excision repair, TDG and MBD 4 appear to be important for epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The functional separation of the single enzymes, however, is not fully understood. Thus, the second aim of my thesis was to further separate UDG functions by using the less complex Schizosaccharomyces pombe model that expresses only the UNG 2 ortholog Ung 1 and the TDG ortholog Thp 1, and that has chromatin regulation mechanisms similar to mammalian cells, while having no DNA methylation. In genetic studies, we found that despite a dominant uracil excision activity of Ung 1 in cell-free extracts, both Ung 1 and Thp 1 contribute to uracil removal and mutation avoidance in vivo. Interestingly, Thp 1 expression mediates cytotoxicity during 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) exposure and in the presence of increased amounts of genomic uracil, most likely reflecting the reported high affinity of Thp 1 to its product abasic site (AP-site). Presence of AP sites could occasionally lead to DNA breakage and, indeed, most spontaneous mitotic recombination events depend on Thp 1 but not on Ung 1. Thus, Ung 1 and Thp 1 have overlapping functions in uracil removal, however, Ung 1 -mediated BER appears fast and mostly error-free while Thp 1 -dependent BER seems slow and error-prone. Given the role of mammalian TDG in regulating gene expression, we compared genome-wide RNA expression in Thp 1 -proficient and -deficient strains and observed a mild but overall down-regulation and a hyper-variability of gene expression in the absence of Thp 1. Thus, Thp 1 might contribute to the maintenance of transcriptionally active chromatin and S. pombe may {{serve as a model for}} studying the impact of UDGs on gene expression. Taken together, my work provided insights into a novel regulatory aspect of Top 1 function in the rDNA of budding yeast and into the function of Ung 1 - and Thp 1 -dependent <b>uracil</b> <b>repair</b> in S. pombe. ...|$|E

The D 6 R polypeptide was expressed in reticulocyte lysates programmed with RNA transcribed from an expression vector containing the T 7 RNA polymerase promoter. A highly specific ethidium bromide fluorescence assay of the in vitro translation product determined that the encoded protein does indeed possess uracil DNA glycosylase activity. Open reading frames from other poxviruses, including vaccinia virus (HindIII D 4 R) and fowlpox (D 4), are highly homologous to D 6 R of SFV and are predicted to encode uracil DNA glycosylases. Identification of the SFV uracil DNA glycosylase provides evidence that this poxviral protein is involved in the repair of the viral DNA genome.

40|$|Deamination of {{cytosine}} residues {{contributes to}} the appearance of uracil in DNA. Uracil DNA glyco-sylase (UDG) initiates <b>uracil</b> excision <b>repair</b> to safeguard the genomic integrity. To study the mechanism of uracil excision in mycobacteria (organisms with G 1 C rich genomes), we have purified UDG from Mycobacterium smegmatis by more than 3000 -fold. The molecular mass of M. smegmatis UDG, as deter-mined by SDS/PAGE, is < 25 kDa and it shows maximum activity at pH 8. 0. The N-terminal sequence analysis shows that the initiating amino acid, formyl-methionine is cleaved from the mature protein. More interestingly, unlike Escherichia coli UDG, which forms a physiologically irreversible complex with the inhibitor protein Ugi, M. smegmatis UDG forms a dissociable complex with it. M. smegmatis UDG excises uracil from the 5 ′-terminal position of the 5 ′-phosphorylated substrates. However, its excision from the 3 ′-penultimate position is extremely poor. Similar to E. coli UDG, M. smegmatis UDG also uses pd(UN) p as its minimal substrate. However, in contrast to E. coli UDG, which excises uracil from dif-ferent loop positions of tetraloop hairpin substrates with highly variable efficiencies, M. smegmatis UDG excises the same uracil residues with comparable efficiencies. Kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) for uracil release from synthetic substrates suggest that M. smegmatis UDG is an efficient enzyme and better suited for molecular biology applications. We discuss {{the usefulness of the}} distinct biochemical properties of M. smegmatis UDG in the possible design of selective inhibitors against it...|$|R
40|$|Cytosine deamination {{is a major}} promutagenic process, {{generating}} G:U mismatches {{that can}} cause transition mutations if not <b>repaired.</b> <b>Uracil</b> is also introduced into DNA via nonmutagenic incorporation of dUTP during replication. In bacteria, uracil is excised by uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDG) related to E. coli UNG, and UNG homologs are found in mammals and viruses. Ung knockout mice display no increase in mutation frequency due to a second UDG activity, SMUG 1, which is specialized for antimutational uracil excision in mammalian cells. Remarkably, SMUG 1 also excises the oxidation-damage product 5 -hydroxymethyluracil (HmU), but like UNG is inactive against thymine (5 -methyluracil), a chemical substructure of HmU. We have solved the crystal structure of SMUG 1 complexed with DNA and base-excision products. This structure indicates a more invasive interaction with dsDNA than observed with other UDGs and reveals an elegant water displacement/replacement mechanism that allows SMUG 1 to exclude thymine from its active site while accepting HmU...|$|R
40|$|Genomic uracil is a DNA lesion {{but also}} an {{essential}} key intermediate in adaptive immunity. In B cells, activation-induced cytidine deaminase deaminates cytosine to uracil (U:G mispairs) in Ig genes to initiate antibody maturation. Uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDGs) such as uracil N-glycosylase (UNG), single strand-selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 (SMUG 1), and thymine-DNA glycosylase remove uracil from DNA. Gene-targeted mouse models are extensively used to investigate the role of these enzymes in DNA repair and Ig diversification. However, possible species differences in uracil processing in humans and mice are yet not established. To address this, we analyzed UDG activities and quantities in human and mouse cell lines and in splenic B cells from Ung+/+ and Ung−/− backcrossed mice. Interestingly, human cells displayed ∼ 15 -fold higher total uracil excision capacity due {{to higher levels of}} UNG. In contrast, SMUG 1 activity was ∼ 8 -fold higher in mouse cells, constituting ∼ 50 % of the total U:G excision activity compared with less than 1 % in human cells. In activated B cells, both UNG and SMUG 1 activities were at levels comparable with those measured for mouse cell lines. Moreover, SMUG 1 activity per cell was not down-regulated after activation. We therefore suggest that SMUG 1 may work as a weak backup activity for UNG 2 during class switch recombination in Ung−/− mice. Our results reveal significant species differences in genomic uracil processing. These findings should be taken into account when mouse models are used in studies of <b>uracil</b> DNA <b>repair</b> and adaptive immunity...|$|R
40|$|Uracil–DNA glycosylase (Ung), a DNA <b>repair</b> enzyme, pioneers <b>uracil</b> {{excision}} <b>repair</b> pathway. Structural determinations and mutational {{analyses of}} the Ung class of proteins have greatly facilitated {{our understanding of the}} mechanism of uracil excision from DNA. More recently, a hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular mechanical analysis revealed that while the histidine (H 67 in EcoUng) of the GQDPYH motif (ω loop) in the active site pocket is important in positioning the reactants, it makes an unfavorable energetic contribution (penalty) in achieving the transition state intermediate. Mutational analysis of this histidine is unavailable from any of the Ung class of proteins. A complication in demonstrating negative role of a residue, especially when located within the active site pocket, is that the mutants with enhanced activity are rarely obtained. Interestingly, unlike the most Ung proteins, the H 67 equivalent in the ω loop in mycobacterial Ung is represented by P 67. Exploiting this natural diversity to maintain structural integrity of the active site, we transplanted an H 67 P mutation in EcoUng. Uracil inhibition assays and binding of a proteinaceous inhibitor, Ugi (a transition state substrate mimic), with the mutant (H 67 P) revealed that its active site pocket was not perturbed. The catalytic efficiency (V_max/K_m) of the mutant was {{similar to that of the}} wild type Ung. However, the mutant showed increased K_m and V_max. Together with the data from a double mutation H 67 P/G 68 T, these observations provide the first biochemical evidence for the proposed diverse roles of H 67 in catalysis by Ung. ...|$|R
40|$|Human APOBEC 3 G {{and several}} other APOBEC 3 {{proteins}} {{have been shown to}} inhibit the replication of a variety of retrotransposons and retroviruses. All of these enzymes can deaminate cytosines within single-strand DNA, but the overall importance of this conserved activity in retroelement restriction has been questioned by reports of deaminase-independent mechanisms. Here, three distinct retroelements, a yeast retrotransposon, Ty 1, a murine endogenous retrovirus, MusD, and a lentivirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), were used to evaluate the relative contributions of deaminase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Although human APOBEC 3 G can restrict the replication of all three of these retroelements, APOBEC 3 G lacking the catalytic glutamate (E 259 Q) was clearly defective. This phenotype was particularly clear in experiments with low levels of APOBEC 3 G expression. In contrast, purposeful overexpression of APOBEC 3 G-E 259 Q was able to cause modest to severe reductions in the replication of Ty 1, MusD, and HIV- 1 (ΔVif). The importance of these observations was highlighted by data showing that CEM-SS T-cell lines expressing near-physiologic levels of APOBEC 3 G-E 259 Q failed to inhibit the replication of HIV- 1 (ΔVif), whereas similar levels of wild-type APOBEC 3 G fully suppressed virus infectivity. Despite the requirement for DNA deamination, uracil DNA glycosylase did not modulate APOBEC 3 G-dependent restriction of Ty 1 or HIV- 1 (ΔVif), further supporting prior studies indicating that the major <b>uracil</b> excision <b>repair</b> system of cells is not involved. In conclusion, the absolute requirement for the catalytic glutamate of APOBEC 3 G in Ty 1, MusD, and HIV- 1 restriction strongly indicates that DNA cytosine deamination {{is an essential part of}} the mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The prokaryotic DNA(cytosine- 5) methyltransferase M. SssI {{shares the}} {{specificity}} of eukaryotic DNA methyltransferases (CG) and is an important model and experimental tool {{in the study of}} eukaryotic DNA methylation. Previously, M. SssI was shown to be able to catalyze deamination of the target cytosine to uracil if the methyl donor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) was missing from the reaction. To test whether this side-activity of the enzyme can be used to distinguish between unmethylated and C 5 -methylated cytosines in CG dinucleotides, we re-investigated, using a sensitive genetic reversion assay, the cytosine deaminase activity of M. SssI. Confirming previous results we showed that M. SssI can deaminate cytosine to uracil in a slow reaction in the absence of SAM and that the rate of this reaction can be increased by the SAM analogue 5 ’-amino- 5 ’-deoxyadenosine. We could not detect M. SssI-catalyzed deamination of C 5 -methylcytosine (m 5 C). We found conditions where the rate of M. SssI mediated C-to-U deamination was at least 100 -fold higher than the rate of m 5 C-to-T conversion. Although this difference in reactivities suggests that the enzyme could be used to identify C 5 -methylated cytosines in the epigenetically important CG dinucleotides, the rate of M. SssI mediated cytosine deamination is too low to become an enzymatic alternative to the bisulfite reaction. Amino acid replacements in the presumed SAM binding pocket of M. SssI (F 17 S and G 19 D) resulted in greatly reduced methyltransferase activity. The G 19 D variant showed cytosine deaminase activity in E. coli, at physiological SAM concentrations. Interestingly, the C-to-U deaminase activity was also detectable in an E. coli ung+ host proficient in <b>uracil</b> excision <b>repair...</b>|$|R
40|$|Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), a {{ubiquitous}} {{and highly}} specific enzyme, commences the <b>uracil</b> excision <b>repair</b> pathway. Structural {{studies have shown}} that the tyrosine in a highly conserved GQDPY water-activating loop of UDGs blocks the entry of thymine or purines into the active site pocket. To further understand the role of this tyrosine (Y 66 in Escherichia coli UDG), we have overproduced and characterized Y 66 F, Y 66 H, Y 66 L and Y 66 W mutants. The complexes of the wild-type, Y 66 F, Y 66 H and Y 66 L UDGs with uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (Ugi) (a proteinaceous substrate mimic) were stable to 8 M urea. However, some dissociation of the complex involving the Y 66 W UDG occurred at this concentration of urea. The catalytic efficiencies (Vmax / Km) of the Y 66 L and Y 66 F mutants were similar to those of the wild-type UDG. However, the Y 66 W and Y 66 H mutants were - 7 - and - 173 -fold compromised, respectively, in their activities. Interestingly, the Y 66 W mutation has resulted in an enzyme which is resistant to product inhibition. Preferential utilization of a substrate enabling a long range contact between the ± 5 phosphate (upstream to the scissile uracil) and the enzyme, and the results of modeling studies showing that the uracilbinding cavity of Y 66 W is wider than those of the wild type and other mutant UDGs, suggest a weaker interaction between uracil and the Y 66 W mutant. Furthermore, the fluorescence spectroscopy of UDGs and their complexes with Ugi, in the presence of uracil or its analog, 5 -bromouracil, suggests compromised binding of uracil in the active site pocket of the Y 66 W mutant. Lack of inhibition of the Y 66 W UDG by apyrimidinic DNA (AP-DNA) is discussed to highlight a potential additional role of Y 66 in shielding the toxic effects of AP-DNA, by lowering the rate of its release for subsequent recognition by an AP endonuclease...|$|R
40|$|Most B cell cancers overexpress {{the enzyme}} activation-induced deaminase {{at high levels}} and this enzyme {{converts}} cytosines in DNA to uracil. The constitutive expression of this enzyme in these cells greatly increases the uracil content of their genomes. We show here that these genomes also contain high levels of abasic sites presumably created during the <b>repair</b> of <b>uracils</b> through base-excision <b>repair.</b> We further show that three alkoxyamines with an alkyne functional group covalently link to abasic sites in DNA and kill immortalized cell lines created from B cell lymphomas, but not other cancers. They also do not kill normal B cells. Treatment of cancer cells {{with one of these}} chemicals causes strand breaks, and the sensitivity of the cells to this chemical depends on the ability of the cells to go through the S phase. However, other alkoxyamines that also link to abasic sites- but lack the alkyne functionality- do not kill cells from B cell lymphomas. This shows that the ability of alkoxyamines to covalently link to abasic sites is insufficient for their cytotoxicity and that the alkyne functionality {{may play a role in}} it. These chemicals violate the commonly accepted bioorthogonality of alkynes and are attractive prototypes for anti-B cell cancer agents...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{cellular}} factors {{belonging to}} the DNA repair machineries, including RAD 18, RAD 52, XPB and XPD, have been described to counteract human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) repli-cation. Recently, Uracil DNA glycosylase 2 (UNG 2), {{a major determinant of}} the <b>uracil</b> base excision <b>repair</b> pathway, was shown to undergo rapid proteasome-dependent degradation following HIV- 1 infection. However, the specific role of intracellular UNG 2 depletion during the course of HIV- 1 infection is not clearly understood. Our study shows {{for the first time that}} overexpression of UNG 2 inhibits HIV- 1 replication. We demonstrate that this viral inhibi-tion is correlated with a marked decrease in transcription efficiency as shown by monitoring HIV- 1 LTR promoter activity and quantification of HIV- 1 RNA levels. Interestingly, UNG 2 inhibits LTR activity when stimulated by Tat transactivator or TNFa, while barely affected using Phorbol ester acti-vation. Mutational analysis of UNG 2 indicates that antiviral activity may require the integrity of the UNG 2 catalytic domain. Altogether, our data indicate that UNG 2 is likely to represent a new host defense factor specifically counteracted by HIV- 1 Vpr. The molecular mechanisms involved in the UNG 2 antiviral activity still remain elusive but may rely on the sequestration of specific cellular factor(s) critical for viral transcription...|$|R
