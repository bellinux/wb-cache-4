5|$|Other bands {{during that}} part of the '80's, both major and not-so-major acts, were really getting on the {{political}} bandwagon for one stupid reason or another. They were all so fucking serious, trying to be a voice for a generation or some shit like that, but worst of all they remained within the parameters of social acceptability. There was also a big censorship flap going on at the time. We looked at it as a chance to catch <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> obscenity quota.|$|E
500|$|In {{an online}} {{interview}} with fans, Torbert stated [...] "You... {{have to have}} a sense of humor for many things from day to day. It is tough to be humorous when the [...] lose, but it's even tougher to face a sick child in a hospital room, and cheer them <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> humorous looks. That's tough." ...|$|E
500|$|Till plays as winger on {{the left}} or right sides and his play has been {{described}} as [...] "tricky". He has described himself as an old-fashioned winger, saying [...] "I am very quick, very fit. I like to get at the full-back – an old-fashioned winger type, if you like. I like to cause the full-back problems and get my crosses in and link <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> full-back as well". Walsall manager Chris Hutchings described him as [...] "an attacking wide-man with pace who is not afraid to take people on" [...] in 2009. Till is also able to play as a striker.|$|E

500|$|We {{really wanted}} to spend time, immerse ourselves, drive {{for hours and hours}} aimlessly with a camera, jumping out and {{shooting}} things that caught my eye. We didn't want to go there and just shoot Frenchy's Chicken and call it an [...] "authentic video." [...] There was tons of hanging out, getting the feel, all with cameras ready. We hooked <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> dude Scotty who was a great help, plus Bun B's brother Truck, and Paul Wall. The city was so receptive, so willing to help, so open, and that leant a lot {{to the fact that we}} really got to glimpse of the real character of Houston.|$|E
500|$|Despite his expulsion, in July 1970 the Labour-controlled Merthyr council offered Davies {{the freedom}} of the borough, an honour which he politely declined; the {{confidence}} of the people recently shown him was, he said, enough. He resumed his place in parliament, on the opposition benches as Labour had unexpectedly lost the election to Edward Heath's Conservatives. Despite some ill-feeling, Davies was not ostracised by his erstwhile colleagues, and was unofficially briefed by the party. He limited his Commons appearances and rarely spoke in debates, generally preferring to serve his constituents from home. On the major national issue of the 1970–74 parliament—Heath's renewed bid for Britain's membership of the European Economic Community (EEC)—Davies voiced uncompromising opposition. In a letter to the South Wales Echo on 9 August 1971 he challenged the government's claim that [...] "our security has been bound <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> European neighbours for over a thousand years", pointing out Britain's involvement in numerous European wars, [...] "including the Hitler war when British security meant co-operation with Russia".|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} the About.com, Nancy Basile's review was mixed to {{positive}} {{and gave the}} episode a score of four out of five. She wrote, [...] "...though I disagree {{with a few of}} the animator's choices, this Christmas special is a treat." [...] Basile criticized its characters especially the use of foam to create the characters and the way Santa Claus was depicted saying [...] "...he looks like a pig with liver spots." [...] The animators responded to this comment about their interpretation of Santa Claus, saying [...] "We definitely wanted to keep an element of strangeness, almost scary aspects in the story." [...] Caballero explained that the idea of making Santa Claus look tired and strange came when they saw a drawing of him by Marc Ceccarelli or Luke Brookshier. Caballero said, [...] "We thought that was a great idea. So we came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> own little back story where Bikini Bottom is the last stop for Santa. He's tired, he wants to get home, take his shoes off ... We honed in on the old descriptions of Santa being a jolly old elf. We pictured him as humanoid, but not necessarily directly human." ...|$|E

2500|$|We {{are killing}} terrorists in self-defense {{and for the}} good of the world, you see.

2500|$|September 2, 2014 - Google Enterprise, the company’s {{business}} product division, {{was officially}} renamed Google for Work.

2500|$|Generalfeldmarschall Paul von Hindenburg, who at {{the time}} of Charles' reign was the {{commander}} in chief of the German Imperial Army, commented in his memoirs:"He tried to compensate for the evaporation of the ethical power which emperor Franz Joseph had represented by offering ethnical reconciliation. Even as he dealt with elements who were sworn to the goal of destroying his empire he believed that his acts of political grace would affect their conscience. These attempts were totally futile; those people had long ago lined <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> common enemies, and were far from being deterred." ...|$|E

Yet none of our chaps died, that I can remember." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "When I {{was twenty}} years old, {{we went to}} the Crows and stole a lot of horses. [...] The Crows {{discovered}} us and followed us all night. [...] When daylight came we saw them behind us. [...] I was the leader. [...] We turned back to fight the Crows. [...] I killed one and took his scalp and a field glass and a Crow necklace from him. [...] We chased the others back a long way and then caught <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> own men again and went on. [...] It was a very cold winter. [...] There were twenty of us and each had four horses. [...] We got them home all right and it was a good trip that time. [...] We had a scalp dance when we got back." ...|$|E

When prompted by Monica to say the Latin, Dougal reads [...] "last rites" [...] consisting {{of the names of}} Italian footballers Alessandro Costacurta and Roberto Baggio (this stems from Graham Linehan and Ardal O'Hanlon being fans of Football Italia).|$|R
