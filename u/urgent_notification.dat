40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess the patterns of patients who use a patient-physician e-mail service, measure physician time required to answer a patient question via e-mail compared with that via telephone, and determine the satisfaction of families who are provided e-mail access to their child's rheumatologist. METHODS. A consecutive series of patients' families were offered e-mail access during a 2 -year period. Data regarding patient e-mail use were collected, including urgency of message, subject matter, message volume, and time of day of messaging. The duration of the pediatric rheumatologist's e-mail interactions and telephone interactions with patients was measured using a stopwatch. After 1 year of enrollment in the patient-physician e-mail service, families were mailed a 12 -item satisfaction survey regarding their e-mail experience. RESULTS. A total of 306 of 328 families who were offered patient-physician e-mail access enrolled, and 121 used the service. The patients sent 40 % of their e-mails outside business hours. Messages that were <b>urgent</b> (<b>notification</b> of disease flare, notification of new symptoms, or parent expectation of same-day response) made up 5. 7 % of the e-mails sent to the physician. Messages that required emergent attention made up 0. 002 % of the e-mails to the physician. Answering patient questions by e-mail was 57 % faster than using the telephone for the physician. The physician received 1. 2 e-mails per day from patients. The families who responded to the survey agreed that patient-physician e-mail increased access to the physician and improved the quality of care. The families did not find that patient-physician e-mail distanced them from their child's doctor. CONCLUSIONS. Patient-physician e-mail is a service that patients will use given the opportunity. The e-mail service enables physicians to answer medical questions with less time spent compared with telephone messaging. In our experience in an academic pediatric subspecialty practice, patients reported enhanced communication and access with the e-mail service...|$|E
40|$|We present MorePhone, an {{actuated}} flexible smartphone with a thin-film E Ink display. MorePhone uses {{shape memory}} alloys to actuate {{the entire surface}} of the display {{as well as individual}} corners. We conducted a participatory study to determine how users associate urgency and notification type with full screen, 1 corner, 2 corner and 3 corner actuations of the smartphone. Results suggest that with the current prototype, actuated shape notifications are useful for visual feedback. <b>Urgent</b> <b>notifications</b> such as alarms and voice calls were best matched with actuation of the entire display surface, while less <b>urgent</b> <b>notifications,</b> such as software notifications were best matched to individual corner bends. While different corner actuations resulted in significantly different matches betwee...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a context-specific electronic design and prototyping approach in an innovative project course at Carnegie Mellon. We built a sensing and notification wearable computing platform, called eWatch, for context-aware computing. eWatch senses user activities and {{provides them with}} <b>urgent</b> <b>notifications.</b> An accelerometer and microphone provide inputs to a model of user interruptibility levels. A vibration motor for tactile feedback and two ultra bright LEDs for visual feedback provide user notification through different vibration patterns and colors. User studies identified appropriate notification schemes for mobile and office settings. Bluetooth communication connects the eWatch to a PDA or desktop computer for sensor data analysis and notification. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} development of a context-aware notification system for university students using RFID technology. This system is leveraging on the student's matrix card as the RFID tag (sensor), RFID reader and server as the processors and screen monitor at the various locations in the campus as the actuator of the output. This system aims to deliver <b>urgent</b> <b>notifications</b> to the intended students immediately at their respective locations. In addition, the system is also able to display personalized information based on the students' preferences and current location when accessing the system. The background of the study, the design approaches for this system and the preliminary evaluation of the prototype are presented in this paper. The evaluation results have indicated that the the proposed system is useful and easy to use...|$|R
40|$|We present four perceptual user {{interface}} systems that explore a continuum from explicit to implicit interaction. Explicit interactions include most of today’s mouse and keyboard-based interaction models, where the user initiates a discrete action and expects a timely discrete response. Implicit interactions may use passive {{monitoring of the}} user over longer periods of time, and result in changing {{some aspect of the}} rest of the interaction. For example, less <b>urgent</b> <b>notifications</b> may be withheld from the user if the system detects they are engaged in a meeting. The first system is FlowMouse, a program that tries to emulate the mouse but suggests more implicit kinds of interaction. Second, we describe GWindows, which focuses complementing the mouse in today’s GUI in a way that might support casual interactions. Then, ToughtLight eschews the traditional notion of an explicit discrete pointer altogether and in so doing presents a number of challenges in designing applications. And finally, S-SEER supports a purely implicit style of interaction driven by models of situational awareness. In presenting this series of projects in order from explicit to implicit modes, we hope to illustrate by way of example the various challenges and opportunities for perceptual {{user interface}}s. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Urgent</b> {{clinician}} <b>notification</b> of low hemo-globin {{values is}} a common practice. The effect of such notification for samples obtained during an office visit is uncertain. Methods: We notified the attending physicians in 100 consecutive cases of outpatients with hemoglobin < 80 g/L. We reviewed the medical charts of these patients with their personal physicians 1 – 2 months later. We considered transfusions unnecessary only when given to a clinically stable patient with probable iron defi-ciency anemia {{in the absence of}} chronic diseases that produce the anemia. Results: Overall, 47 (47 %) of the patients were referred to the emergency room (ER), and 31 of the 47 (66 %) were transfused. Increasing age and decreasing hemoglobi...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} functionality of the Scope, a glanceable notification summarizer. The Scope is an information visualization designed to unify notifications and ameliorate distractions. It allows users to remain aware of notifications from multiple sources of information, including e-mail, instant messaging, information alerts, and appointments. The design employs a circular radar-like screen divided into sectors that group different kinds of <b>notifications.</b> The more <b>urgent</b> a <b>notification</b> is, the more centrally it is placed. Visual emphasis and annotation is used to reveal important properties of notifications. Several natural gestures allow users to zoom in on particular regions and to selectively drill down on items. We present key aspects of the Scope design, review {{the results of an}} initial user study, and {{describe the}} motivation and outcome of an iteration on the visual design.

40|$|Executive summary In 1999, the National Disease Surveillance Centre (NDSC) {{was asked}} by the Department of Health and Chil dren to review the list of {{notifiable}} diseases and to make recommendations regarding additions or amendments to the current list. It was also asked to review the operation of the no tification system, to co nsider the need for case definitions, and whether laboratories should be required to notify the listed diseases. A sub-com m ittee of the NDSC was established to complete this task. In drawing up the report the sub-committee cons ulted widely with a ll professional grou ps involved in notification of infectious diseases. The main points highlighted in the report are as follows: • A new national system for surveillance of infectious diseases of public health importance should be established. In this system there will be four categories of notifiers, namely GPs, hospital clinic i ans, laboratory directors and public healt h doctors. Each notifier will be required to notify the Director of Public Health listed dis e ases or isolates that they enc ount er during the course of their work. As each c a tegory of notifier is likely to regularly identify only a subset of the total list of diseases, separate lists will be pr esented for each category, as w e ll as one masterlist of al l notifiable diseases. • The report recomme nds that th e term Me dical Officer of Health, which was abolished in law in 1998, be reintroduced, and that the Medical Officer of Health be the Director of Public Health. • There is litt l e advantage in hav ing an appro p riate list of diseases for notification if there is no formal 24 -hour a day, 7 -da ys per week system for responding to <b>urgent</b> <b>notifications</b> that require public health action. The report recommends that this issue be addressed as a matter of urgency. Page 4 • The changes propos ed are wide ranging. In order that the new system envisaged in the report group can be estab lished, a s i gnificant investment of resources will be required. This need for resources will arise in primary care, public healt h, in laboratories and at NDSC. • There is an urgent need to develop a nd support initiatives to introduce electronic communication between all partners in the system. Finally, the sub-committee are of the opinio n that establishing an implementation group would help the ordered, phased intr oduction of th e proposed new system...|$|R
