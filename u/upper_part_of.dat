5|$|Nearly {{all of the}} {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek is biologically degraded, with the only exceptions being several headwater streams. However, the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{the watershed}} is less severely degraded than the lower reaches.|$|E
5|$|The Mahanoy Creek {{watershed}} is 66 percent forested land, 21 percent agricultural land, 9 percent barren mined land, and 4 percent developed land. However, the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Mahanoy Creek is 50 percent forested land, 44 percent mined land, 5 percent developed land, {{and less}} than 1 percent agricultural land. There are six boroughs in the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the watershed. There are a total of 28 municipalities in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the main sequence {{in the region of}} class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars {{in this part of the}} instability strip that intersects the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E

5|$|In {{the medieval}} period some {{religious}} institutions displayed ancient Greek coins {{of the island}} of Rhodes as specimens of the Thirty Pieces of Silver. The obverses of these coins showed a facing head of the sun god Helios, with rays projecting around the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> it. These rays were interpreted as {{a representation of the}} Crown of Thorns.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{transept}} chambers {{would have}} been covered with one large (or several smaller) capstones, enclosing the chambers containing human remains. The earth covering and the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the cromlech have been removed, leaving the passageway and lateral chambers fully exposed. There is no record of a capstone having been discovered.|$|E

5|$|The {{capybara}} has a heavy, barrel-shaped {{body and}} short head, with reddish-brown fur on the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath.

5|$|The upper esophageal {{sphincter}} {{surrounds the}} <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the esophagus. It consists of skeletal muscle {{but is not}} under voluntary control. Opening of the upper esophageal sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex. The primary muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor.|$|E
5|$|The {{west end}} of the nave is {{dominated}} by an eight-light window in the Perpendicular Gothic style which almost fills the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the west wall.

5|$|A fire {{accident}} occurred in 1793 that destroyed the large gallery that connected the chapel {{to the north}} tower, and the west face of the large central tower was seriously damaged. The fire spread along the roofs and turrets of the northwest wing, and the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the north tower was also burned. The chapel was sacked, and the flames destroyed its facade and part of its north wall. The crypt was not damaged. Most of the floors and fireplaces in the château and all the doors, windows and woodwork were irreparably destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas of the skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the mouth}} of Dry Hollow and {{the mouth of}} Bunnell Run, the waters of Hammersley Fork are a Rosgen type F and a Rosgen type C stream.

5|$|During archaeological {{investigation}} of the ballcourt a well-preserved tennoned ballgame marker was found placed on the western bench. Its original placement was indicated by {{a hole in the}} <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the ballcourt wall. The second marker that would have been placed directly opposite the first has never been found and the area of the ballcourt wall where it would have been had collapsed prior to excavations. Replicas of the ballcourt marker have been placed in both walls; the original is in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{the waters}} of Beaver Lake once again receded to their lowest level since 1984, just above 1,100feet (335m). This {{generated}} a new brief interest in Monte Ne and people were once again attracted {{to the edge of}} the lake to explore the remains. The <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the never constructed pyramid were exposed for a time before being once again swallowed by the lake.|$|E
5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, {{the lungs}} {{begin to develop}} as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the digestive system. When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins {{to pass through the}} lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E

5|$|In {{front of}} the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the cervix lies the bladder, {{separated}} from it by cellular connective tissue known as parametrium, which also extends over {{the sides of the}} cervix. To the rear, the supravaginal cervix is covered by peritoneum, which runs onto the back of the vaginal wall and then turns upwards and onto the rectum, forming the recto-uterine pouch. The cervix is more tightly connected to surrounding structures {{than the rest of the}} uterus.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E
