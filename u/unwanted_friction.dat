50|$|The 2008-2010 Sequoias {{were part}} of one of the 2009-2010 Toyota recalls that {{required}} the installation of a small shim to relieve <b>unwanted</b> <b>friction</b> and restore fluidity to the accelerator pedal. Early 2003 Sequoias were recalled to reprogram the Vehicle Stability Control system due to the possibility of poor acceleration at certain low speeds. The 2002-3 Sequoia model years also had a defect in the front ball joints. 2004 Toyota Sequoias were subject to the Takata Airbag recall done for free by Toyota dealerships.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{new types of}} ball {{bearings}} in the market which deviate from the original design and/or material of the standard stainless steel ball bearing. For example, {{a certain type of}} bearing has an inward facing curved surface, to prevent the string from rubbing {{on the sides of the}} yo-yo, which would cause <b>unwanted</b> <b>friction</b> when performing intricate string tricks. Other manufacturers replicate this with a similar inwardly curved surface, but use minor modifications. Some high-end bearings use ceramic composites in the balls of the bearing, to reduce internal friction, again making for a smoother spinning yo-yo.|$|E
50|$|Burrs in {{drilled holes}} cause {{fastener}} and material problems. Burrs cause more stress to be concentrated {{at the edges}} of holes, decreasing resistance to fracture and shortening fatigue life. They interfere with the seating of fasteners, causing damage to fastener or the assembly itself. Cracks caused by stress and strain can result in material failure. Burrs in holes also increase the risk of corrosion, which may be due to variations in the thickness of coatings on a rougher surface. Sharp corners tend to concentrate electrical charge, increasing the risk of static discharge. Burrs in moving parts increase <b>unwanted</b> <b>friction</b> and heat. Rough surfaces also result in problems with lubrication, as wear is increased at the interfaces of parts. This makes it necessary to replace them more frequently. Electrical charge buildup can cause corrosion.|$|E
40|$|Because {{of large}} surface-to-volume ratios and low {{restoring}} forces, <b>unwanted</b> adhe-sion and <b>friction</b> can dominate the perform-ance of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. To guarantee the func-tion {{and reliability of}} MEMS devices, tri-bologists must understand the origins of adhesion, friction, and wear over {{a broad range of}} length scales from the macro-scopic to the molecular. In this article, we present an overview of challenges, suc-cesses, and initial steps toward a funda-mental understanding. Polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) is the material of choice in surface-micromachine...|$|R
40|$|In the extrusion, big {{friction}} forces rise between the tool and the semi - product, which worsen {{a great deal}} {{the parameters of the}} material's plastic deformation process. In order to diminish the <b>unwanted</b> effect of <b>friction</b> in the extrusion processing, the authors have conceived special and original equipment, with whose help the friction force is acting towards the active one. The paper presents experimental research regarding the ways of improving the extrusion process parameters, under the conditions of using respective equipment...|$|R
50|$|Thanks to {{bombardment}} by radioactive particles {{during a}} tornado, Texas Twister has the psychokinetic ability to accelerate air molecules to high velocity, thereby creating a tornado-like mass of swirling wind around him. Although he usually creates the tornado with {{himself at the}} center, he can create tornadoes up to 100 ft away from his body. He can control {{the size of the}} tornado at will and can create a tornado 200 ft in diameter with outer winds moving at speeds up to 225 mi/h km/h. Such a wind swirling about his body is capable of lifting him off the ground and supporting him in midair. He has superhuman reflexes, and various abilities enabling him to withstand the rigors of motion inside a tornado, such as denser skin to prevent <b>unwanted</b> heat loss, <b>friction</b> burns, and particle abrasions, enhanced eyesight, and a high degree of resistance to dizziness and motion sickness.|$|R
40|$|Micro-bistable {{mechanisms}} {{are used in}} microswitches and microvalves to reduce power consumption as power is applied only to switch states. Many of the bistable mechanism designs that have been presented incorporate rigid-body joints. These joints introduce <b>unwanted</b> <b>friction</b> and poor repeatability into and a bistable system to produce a force for assembling micro-parts (Vangbo and BÃ¤cklund, 1998) have also been suggested. These bistable micromechanisms generally {{fall into one of}} two broad categories. Many of the devices presented use residual stress in deposited films to create beam buckling, a well-known bistable phenomenon. Other devices use strain energy storage and a mixture of rigid-body and compliant joint...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:The current {{research}} focuses on the estimation of bulk density and angle of repose of tea leaves at different moisture content and size and {{development of a mathematical}} model for bulk density and angle of repose using response surface methodology followed by numerical optimization of responses using desirability functions. Further work was done on the design optimization of feed hopper and metering system with bulk density and angle of repose. In tea processing, during withering and maceration process the whole leaves are subjected to size reduction, rolling, maceration, feeding and conveyance. The tea leaves are generally not uniform due to plucking standard, moisture content of the leaf and the variety. Non-uniformity in feed rate of tea leaves which will ultimately pass through the feed hopper will not only affect the cut size of the leaves but <b>unwanted</b> <b>friction</b> between CTC machine roller...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{needs for}} precise {{manipulation}} in medical surgery, manufacturing automation and structural health monitoring have motivated development of high accuracy, bandwidth and cost-effective sensing systems. Among these is {{a class of}} multi-axis electromagnetic devices where embedded magnetic fields can be capitalized for compact position estimation eliminating <b>unwanted</b> <b>friction,</b> stiction and inertia arising from dedicated and separate sensing mechanisms. Using fields for position measurements, however, is a challenging 'inverse problem' since they are often modeled in the 'forward' sense and their inverse solutions are often highly non-linear and non-unique. A general method to design a multisensor system that capitalizes on the existing magnetic field in permanent magnet (PM) actuators is presented. This method {{takes advantage of the}} structural field symmetry and meticulous placement of sensors to discretize the motion range of a PM-based device into smaller magnetic field segments, thereby reducing the required characterization domain. Within these localized segments, unique field-position correspondence is induced using field measurements from a network of multiple-axis sensors. A direct mapping approach utilizing trained artificial neural networks to attain multi-DOF positional information from distributed field measurements is employed as an alternative to existing computationally intensive model based methods which are unsuitable for real-time control implementation. Validation and evaluation of this technique are performed through field simulations and experimental investigation on an electromagnetic spherical actuator. An inclinometer was used as a performance comparison and experimental results have corroborated the superior tracking ability of the field-based sensing system. While the immediate application is field-based orientation determination of an electromagnetic actuator, it is expected that the design method can be extended to develop other sensing systems that harnesses other scalar, vector and tensor fields.
