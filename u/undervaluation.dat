25|$|Much of {{the puzzle}} has been {{resolved}} through mathematical modeling and additional experiments. In particular, starting in 1989, Gunduz Caginalp and collaborators modeled the trading with two concepts that are generally missing in classical economics and finance. First, they assumed that supply and demand of an asset depended not only on valuation, but on {{factors such as the}} price trend. Second, they assumed that the available cash and asset are finite (as they are in the laboratory). This is contrary to the “infinite arbitrage” that is generally assumed to exist, and to eliminate deviations from fundamental value. Utilizing these assumptions together with differential equations, they predicted the following: (a) The bubble would be larger if there was initial <b>undervaluation.</b> Initially, “value-based” traders would buy the undervalued asset creating an uptrend, which would then attract the “momentum” traders and a bubble would be created. (b) When the initial ratio of cash to asset value in a given experiment was increased, they predicted that the bubble would be larger.|$|E

40|$|Growth is {{endogenous}} {{in small}} open economies with substantial hidden or open unemployment, even under constant returns to scale.

500|$|The biggest {{obstacle}} to the plan's implementation soon {{proved to be the}} Berlin Blockade [...] by the USSR, which was followed by a western counter-blockade of the Soviet occupation zone. As there were long-established economic ties between the western zone and the eastern, which was highly dependent on supplies from the West, the blockade was more damaging to the East. The West Berlin SPD newspaper Sozialdemokrat reported in April 1949, how Rau clearly criticized the blockade in a meeting of SED apparatchiks and {{there is reason to believe}} that he did the same in the meetings with the SMAD. According to the paper, Rau spoke of a [...] "bad speculation" [...] regarding the <b>undervaluation</b> of the dependence on western supplies, stating that the [...] "broadminded Soviet help" [...] turned out as insufficient and hinting that the blockade would soon be lifted.

[...] Gulf, therefore, sought to resist Pickens by various means, including refiling as a Delaware corporation, voiding the ability of shareholders to cumulatively vote (fearing that Pickens would use his shares to gain control of the board) and listening to offers from Ashland Oil (which would double Gulf's price from its pre-Mesa level), General Electric (two years before it took over the media company NBC/RKO) and finally Chevron to act as its white knight in late 1984. Gulf divested many of its worldwide operating subsidiaries and then merged with Chevron by the spring of 1985. The Mesa group of investors was reported to have made a profit of $760million ($ million today) when it assigned its Gulf shares to Chevron.

40|$|Commentators on {{insider trading}} {{are divided into}} two camps, one in favor of regulation, the other in favor of deregulation. The {{arguments}} for the two positions are manifold but not irreconcilable. I show that important gains to social welfare come with insider trading on negative information (sales), whereas losses often result {{from the use of}} positive information (purchases). Thus, I look at a regulation that allows insiders to use negative but not positive non-public information. Because positive information will be disclosed much sooner than negative information, the marginal incentive (and marginal gain to social welfare, respectively) of insider trading as a disclosure mechanism is greater for sales than for purchases. Likewise, stock bubbles generally occur in terms of overvaluations, not <b>undervaluations,</b> emphasizing the importance of insider trading on negative information as a deterrent. The case law on insider trading has long since recognized the distinction between the two types of information, a fact that commentators have either neglected or criticized. A reinterpretation allows me to reconcile presumed contractions of the case law. My analysis also explains empirical data suggesting that insider trading involves more selling than buying, while enforcement actions focus on purchasing activity...|$|R

The problem for the Odawa was that the 1855 Treaty of Detroit had been interpreted as severing the tribal governments of each of the bands. To be eligible for filing a claim, they first had to confirm that the bands had [...] "continued to be distinct, self-governing nations". In 1946, the Dominics called for a meeting of local tribes at the local Petoskey grocery store. Only 20 members showed up, making them realize the need to organize. Traveling throughout the state to document descendants of Odawa listed on the Durant Roll (1907-1910), they identified 3,000 American Indians who might be eligible to pursue claims against the U. S. government. In 1948, Dominic, her father, and her husband founded the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association (NMOA), which Robert serving as president of the organization and Waunetta serving as secretary. The organization contained eleven bands of northern Odawa who had been signatories to the 1836 Treaty of Washington and the subsequently signed 1855 Treaty of Detroit.

500|$|The {{events in}} 1536 {{surrounding}} {{the fate of}} the abbey at the dissolution of the monasteries are complicated, and included a dispute between SirPiers Dutton, who was in a powerful position as the Sheriff of Cheshire, and SirWilliam Brereton, the deputy-chamberlain of Chester. Dutton's estate was next to that of the abbey, and Dutton plotted to gain some of its land from the Crown after the dissolution; while Brereton supported the abbot against Dutton and held the lucrative position of steward of the abbey. A campaign of vilification was directed at the canons, asserting that they were guilty of [...] "debauched conduct". Then, in 1535, Dutton falsely accused the abbot and Brereton of issuing counterfeit coins. This charge was dismissed mainly because one of Dutton's witnesses was considered to be [...] "unconvincing". Playing into Duttons' hands was the gross <b>undervaluation</b> of the abbey's assets as reported to the royal commissioners of the Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535; as a result of which the net annual income of the abbey was recorded, falsely, as falling below the £200 threshold that would subsequently be chosen for the first round of dissolutions in 1536, although whether this subterfuge was due to the machinations of Dutton or the abbot (or both) remains unclear. Brereton and the abbot appear to have attempted to have the dissolution cancelled subject to the payment of a fine, {{as was the case in}} large numbers of other houses in similar circumstances; but in the abbot's absence dissolution commissioners arrived unananounced at the abbey in early October 1536. There was considerable opposition, the commissioners being menaced by around 300local people; for whom the abbot, rushing back, threw an impromptu feast complete with roasted ox. According to Dutton's account, after barricading themselves in a tower the commissioners managed to send a letter to Dutton, who arrived with a force of men in the middle of the night. Most of the rioters fled, but Dutton arrested the abbot and four of the canons, who were sent to Halton Castle and then to prison in Chester. Dutton sent a report of the events to HenryVIII; who demanded that if the abbot and canons had behaved as Dutton reported, they should be immediately executed as traitors. [...] However, because the kings instructions had been conveyed by the Lord Chancellor in the form of letters to both Dutton and Brereton, the two faction leaders would be required to act together to effect them; with the consequence that Brereton was temporarily able to stall any such action by refusing to meet with Dutton. [...] Events elsewhere in the country further delayed the execution and, following an intercession to Thomas Cromwell (whose own informal contacts had cast doubt on the reliability of Dutton's reports), the abbot and canons were discharged and awarded pensions. The abbey was made uninhabitable, the lead from the roof, the bell metal, and other valuable materials were confiscated for the king, and the building lay empty for nine years. The estate came into the ownership of the Crown, and it was managed by Brereton. From the evidence of damage to the tiled floor of the church, Brown and Howard-Davis conclude it is likely that the church was demolished at an early stage, but otherwise the archaeological evidence for this period is sparse and largely negative.|$|E
2500|$|Education in Ethiopia {{has been}} [...] {{dominated}} by the [...] Ethiopian Orthodox Church for many centuries until secular education was adopted in the early 1900s. Prior to 1974, Ethiopia had an estimated illiteracy rate well above 90% and compared poorly {{with the rest of}} Africa in the provision of schools and universities. After 1974 revolution, emphasis was placed on increasing literacy in rural areas. Practical subjects were stressed, as was the teaching of socialism. By 2015, the literacy rate had increased to 49.1%, though this is still poor compared to {{most of the rest of}} Africa. Recently, there has been massive expansion throughout the educational system. Access to primary is limited to urban locations and they are mostly owned by the private sector and Faith Based organizations. Primary school education consists of two cycles from grades 1 to 4 and grades 5 to 8. Secondary schools have two cycles from grades 9 to 10 and grades 11 to 12. Primary schools have over 90% of 7 year olds enrolled although only about half complete the two cycles. This situation varies from one region to the other and it is even worst in agro-pastoral locations, such as Somali and [...] Afar regions, as well as in the growing regions such as Gambella and Benshangul Gumz. [...] A much smaller proportion of children attend secondary school and even fewer attend the second cycle. School attendance is lowest in rural areas due to lack of provision and alternative occupations. The school curriculum in later years covers more subjects at a higher level than curricula in most other countries. Low pay and <b>undervaluation</b> of teachers contributes to poor quality teaching. This is exacerbated by large class sizes and poor resources resulting on poor performance on national assessments. There is evidence of corruption including forgery of certificates. Many primary schools have introduced mother-tongue teaching but there have been difficulties where small minority languages are concerned. English medium instruction remains a problem throughout the later years of education. Girls' access to education has been improved but early marriage decreases their attendance. Girls' educational attainment is adversely affected by gender stereotypes, violence, lack of sanitary facilities and the consequences of sexual activity. Jimma University is addressing some problems women experience in higher education. TVETs have introduced competence based assessments although many lack adequate resources. Teacher training has been up-graded. All higher education has been expanding but this has not been accompanied by sufficient expansion in staffing and resources. There have been difficulties in introducing BPR with poorly paid university staff supplementing their incomes where possible. Universities need to match training to market demands. All colleges and universities suffer from the same disadvantages as schools. Library facilities are poor, classes are large and there is lack of equipment.|$|E

40|$|Using {{the vector}} auto-regression (VAR) and the vector error-correction Models (VECM), this paper {{analyzes}} the short-term {{dynamics of the}} prices of CO 2 emissions in response {{to changes in the}} prices of oil, coal, natural gas, electricity and carbon emission allowances. The results show that: (i) a positive shock to the crude oil prices has a negative effect on the CO 2 allowance prices; (ii) an unexpected increase in the natural gas prices raises the price of CO 2 emissions; (iii) a positive shock to the prices of the fuel of choice, coal, has virtually no significant impact on the CO 2 prices; (iv) there is a clear positive effect of the coal prices on the CO 2 allowance prices when the electricity prices are excluded from the VAR system; and (v) a positive shock to the electricity prices reduces the price of the CO 2 allowances. We also find that the energy price shocks have a persistent impact on the CO 2 allowance prices, with the largest effect occurring six months after a shock strikes. The effect is particularly strong {{in the case of the}} natural gas price shocks. Additionally, we estimate that it takes between 7. 3 and 9. 6 months to halve the gap between the actual and the equilibrium prices of the CO 2 allowances, i. e., to erase any price over- or <b>undervaluations</b> after a shock strikes. Finally, the empirical findings suggest an important degree of substitution between the three primary sources of energy (i. e., crude oil, natural gas and coal), particularly, when electricity prices are excluded from the VAR system.

40|$|The {{economic}} growth and development process of the Latin American economies has been historically uneven. The persistent differences in per capita income growth and technological progress appears to be largely attributable to differences in economic policy. This thesis examines the growth effects of exchange rate variations, currency misalignments and nominal exchange rate regimes on productivity growth, the role of capital accumulation on {{economic growth}} and relative income differences, {{and the role of}} inflation thresholds on economic growth in thirty-two Latin American economies over a period of fifty years from 1960 to 2010. Our methodology implements the system generalized method of moment’s estimation approach for dynamic panel data models of productivity and economic growth where the growth determinants are crucially assumed endogenous to the growth process. In addition, we implement the novel dynamic panel threshold estimation methodology to growth models. We carry out these estimations using our new and extended macroeconomic dataset for the region. The main original contributions of this thesis are as follow. In Chapter 2 we show that real exchange rate depreciations and exchange rate volatility have a contractionary effect on productivity growth in Latin America. In addition, we find evidence on the neutrality of currency misalignments and nominal exchange rate regimes in explaining productivity variations. However, our results show that currency <b>undervaluations</b> and flexible exchange rate regimes correlates with lower productivity growth. Our findings in Chapter 3 show that the acquisition of capital imports enhances {{economic growth and}} lessens relative income differences. However, countries that invest relatively more in domestic capital experience a faster relative income growth with respect to the Unites States.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a collection}} of four essays, where the unifying theme is how different exchange rate regimes have affected developing countries’ economic performance in different respects. In particular, we analyse the consequences on developing countries’ exports, but also, to some extent, the effects on their economic growth. Chapter 1 serves as an introductory chapter and provides a background to the dissertation. Furthermore, it outlines the main results of the study. Chapter 2 analyses the effects of exchange rate risk on exports in a theoretical framework. The implications of fixed versus variable costs of production are explored and contrasted between exporting firms in developing countries and industrialised countries. We argue that exporting firms in developing countries generally have short-run variable costs to greater extent than exporting firms in industrialised countries, and that these differences imply that exporting firms in developing countries are more likely to reduce their export quantity as a consequence of exchange rate risk. Chapter 3 examines the effects of exchange rate volatility on the export supply of some South East Asian developing countries and on developed countries’ demand for their exports, using quarterly data from 1979 to 1989. Since the developing countries of the study have ‘managed’ their exchange rates one way or the other, a proxy variable for realignment expectations is included in their export supply functions. Exchange rate volatility measures are estimated in a univariate GARCH model, and the parallel to official exchange rate ratio is used as a proxy for realignment expectations. The results indicate that exchange rate volatility vis-à-vis the U. S. dollar has hampered the export supply of the developing countries, while no such effects are found on the developed countries’ demand for exports. As for realignment expectations, no effects are found on the developing countries’ export supply. Chapter 4 analyses the effects of different exchange rate regimes on developing countries’ exports. Previous studies have often focused on the export effects of exchange rate volatility and exchange rate misalignments separately. Our approach differs since we concentrate on the net effects of exchange rate regimes on exports, thereby accounting for the export effects of both exchange rate volatility and exchange rate misalignments. During our study period, 1983 - 1992, countries pegging to a single currency have experienced the weakest export performance, while countries with an independently floating currency have experienced the strongest export performance. Our results may be interpreted as an indication that exchange rate misalignments have affected the developing countries’ export performance to a relatively greater extent than exchange rate volatility. Chapter 5 brings out some empirical evidence on the determinants of nine Asian developing countries’ real effective exchange rates (REER), covering the period 1966 to 1992. We derive measures of REER misalignments and analyse if such misalignments have affected the real GDP per capita growth rates by affecting total factor productivity and factor accumulation. A first finding is that REER misalignments have differed largely across countries, ranging from slight <b>undervaluations</b> to large overvaluations. A second finding is that the more overvalued the REER has been, the lower has investments as a share of GDP been. Since we also find that the investment share is positively related to the real GDP per capita growth rate, we have a link between REER misalignments and growth. The more overvalued the REER, the lower the rate of factor accumulation, and the lower the real GDP per capita growth rate. No effects are, however, found of REER misalignments on the real GDP per capita growth rate through effects on total factor productivity...|$|R

I suppose I am a deeply religious man, as men of my quality go, but I hate more and more, as I grow older, the shadow of intolerance cast by religious organisations.
