30|$|Fire modeled in 2013 —the year {{data was}} collected—resulted in {{mortality}} {{of more than}} a third of live BA <b>under</b> moderate <b>fire</b> weather conditions, and nearly half <b>under</b> severe <b>fire</b> weather conditions in outbreak stands. Pre-outbreak stands that were grown to 2013 in FVS sustained over 40 % BA mortality <b>under</b> moderate <b>fire</b> weather conditions, and resulted in a loss of all live BA <b>under</b> severe <b>fire</b> weather conditions. Torching indices were greater than moderate and severe fire weather condition wind speeds, indicating that torching is unlikely. Crowning indices were less than torching indices for pre-outbreak and outbreak stands, and pre-outbreak stands had lower crowning indices than outbreak stands (Table 5).|$|R

5|$|Elizabeth Armstrong {{was praised}} {{by some as}} a heroine for her actions during the battle, {{displaying}} the kind of courage <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> the militia had so badly lacked during the first months of the Black Hawk War. Her actions, in part, helped the fort's outnumbered defenders give Black Hawk the impression the Apple River Fort was more heavily defended than had been anticipated.|$|E

50|$|During {{the period}} 29 September/3 October 1918 near Cambrai, France, Captain MacGregor acted with most {{conspicuous}} bravery and leadership. He led his company <b>under</b> intense <b>fire,</b> and although wounded, located {{and put out}} of action enemy machine-guns which were checking progress, killing four and taking eight prisoners. He then reorganised his command <b>under</b> heavy <b>fire</b> and {{in the face of}} stubborn resistance continued the advance. Later, after a personal daylight reconnaissance <b>under</b> heavy <b>fire,</b> he established his company in Neuville St. Remy, thereby greatly assisting the advance into Tilloy.|$|R

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} thermal model is proposed {{to predict the}} temperature histories of various components of composite connections <b>under</b> <b>fires.</b> The model was carefully calibrated against a series of standard fire tests. Temperature histories, both within connections and in composite sections, are compared and calibrated. A two-dimensional finite element mechanical model is adopted and calibrated to predict the structural response of composite connections at elevated temperatures. Both of the proposed models are verified to be efficient tools for integrated analysis and design of composite end-plate connections <b>under</b> various <b>fire</b> scenarios. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2010. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Later in {{the morning}} North Korean barges crossed the Naktong below A Company. The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the {{southern}} tip of the ridge overlooking Agok to take these troops <b>under</b> <b>fire.</b> When the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base. The company hit these houses with artillery. The North Koreans broke from the houses, running for the river. At this the light machine gun {{at the tip of the}} ridge took them <b>under</b> <b>fire,</b> as did another across the Naktong to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector. Proximity fuze artillery fire decimated this group. Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force. In the afternoon, US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company; only part of it was recovered. The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the war, these words would prove prophetic. No Confederate forces would bring Fort Greble <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> during its entire {{four-year}} active military career, and its garrison units, rotated regularly, served quietly behind its earthen walls.|$|E

She also hit a target that flamed spectacularly: either a {{fuel storage area}} or an ammunition dump.|$|E

He was dragged back to the helicopter and flown to the medical team aboard the RFA Sir Percivale, dying despite intensive resuscitation attempts on board. The SAS proceeded to clear the village, engaging those West Side Boys who offered resistance and capturing those who surrendered, including Foday Kallay.|$|E
