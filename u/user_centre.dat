40|$|There is a {{wide variety}} of {{conflicting}} guidance available on appropriate methods to use to support <b>user</b> <b>centred</b> design. The ISO 13407 standard provides a framework for applying <b>user</b> <b>centred</b> design, without stipulating which methods should be used. Based on wide experience of EC and commercial projects, the TRUMP and UsabilityNet projects selected sets of methods to support ISO 13407 that {{have been found to be}} cost-effective in commercial application.

40|$|Both {{in formal}} and {{computational}} natural language semantics, the classical correspondence view of meaning – and, more specifically, {{the view that}} the meaning of a declarative sentence coincides with its truth conditions – is widely held. Truth (in the world or a situation) plays the role of the given, and meaning is analysed in terms of it. Both language and the world feature in this perspective on meaning, but language users are conspicuously absent. In contrast, the inferentialist semantics that Robert Brandom proposes in his magisterial book ‘Making It Explicit’ puts the language <b>user</b> <b>centre</b> stage. According to his theory of meaning, the utterance of a sentence is meaningful in as far as it is a move by a language user in a game of giving and asking for reasons (with reasons underwritten by a notion of good inferences). In this paper, I propose a prooftheoretic formalisation of the game of giving and asking for reasons that lends itself to computer implementation. In the current proposal, I flesh out an account of defeasible inferences, a variety of inferences which play a pivotal role in ordinary (and scientific) language use...|$|E

Further, two studies of <b>user</b> <b>centred</b> evaluation in practical settings were performed. The IT professionals participating in those studies were using the software development process Scrum to plan their work. The results show that <b>user</b> <b>centred</b> evaluation is infrequently conducted in Scrum projects, compared to testing activities like acceptance testing. The main type of evaluation is qualitative. Few participants measure user performance or use surveys to gather quantitative results on the usability and the user experience. IT professionals get feedback from users in an informal way and gather informal feedback from peers. Many participants use a mixture of methods for gathering feedback on their work. The outcome of this thesis shows that IT professionals should be encouraged to include users whenever possible when evaluating software, for example by using the think-aloud method. Using heuristic evaluation prior to conducting think-aloud evaluations is also recommended. In addition, IT professionals are encouraged to evaluate their software in an informal way frequently, rather than waiting for the right time to conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation. To advance this field further, researchers who want to improve the evaluation activity for the IT professionals should study how <b>user</b> <b>centred</b> evaluation methods could be combined in an efficient way and how the use of qualitative evaluation methods could be made more effective.

40|$|As a <b>User</b> <b>Centred</b> Design group placed {{centrally}} in {{a larger}} company, one is regularly confronted {{with the question of}} transferring competence to other functions within the organisation. These requests will be motivated by the need for expanding the activities or spreading the mind-set of user orientation. Frequently regular development and marketing staff move into usability related tasks and look for training. So, it is not seldom that we as <b>user</b> <b>centred</b> design specialists are asked upon to convey our skills to others. An activity which is likely to fall in a dilemma between teaching 'easy-to-learn methods' (methods which are cooked up by others and a bit old - from when we did a presentation last) or a <b>user</b> <b>centred</b> design attitude (so that the learners can design their own methods through continuous experimenting and learning). The latter is definitely richer but much more difficult to convey. This is the dilemma we would like to address in our position paper.

40|$|This {{deliverable}} {{describes the}} <b>User</b> <b>Centred</b> Design approach {{that has been}} adopted within the COMUNICAR project. In this design approach several iterative steps were taken to design and evaluate the multimedia Human Machine Interface that is able to manage all the information exchanges between the driver and the vehicle according to the driving conditions and the drivers activity. The <b>User</b> <b>Centred</b> Design approach consisted of three main steps: 1. Virtual prototype design phase and laboratory test 2. Tests in a driving simulator 3. Tests in real {{cars on the road}} in Sweden and Italy All three steps have been described extensively in separate deliverables. This deliverable just shortly gives a description of the procedure of the tests and their main results and conclusions. The last chapter gives the overall conclusions regarding the evaluated performance of the Information Manager (that part of the Human Machine Interface that prioritises and postpones messages to the driver in order to avoid driver overload) and regarding the <b>user</b> <b>centred</b> approach. In general, it is concluded that the <b>User</b> <b>Centred</b> Design approach works very well in the design and test cycle of an in-vehicle HMI. It has been verified that what is not very useful is to describe the complete set of procedures since the very beginning as the procedures are refined continuously during the process. With respect to the Information Manager and its effects on traffic safety, it is concluded that driver workload decreases when presenting information to the driver that is managed by this system. Therefore managing the information exchange between the driver and several information and driver support systems has a positive effect on traffic safety. An important side mark here is that this positive effect is only present when the situation for the driver becomes critical (i. e. already a high workload situation) ...|$|R
