2500|$|On average, Communications service {{providers}} utilize {{an average of}} just 35 to 40 percent of available network capacity. Recently, telecommunications software vendors such as Telcordia and Ericsson have promoted yield management as a strategy for communications {{service providers}} to generate additional revenue and reduce capital expenditures by maximizing subscriber use of available network bandwidth. Approaches include basing a strategy on innovative services explicitly designed to use only spare capacity and borrowing proven methods from the airline industry. The approach can {{be more difficult to}} implement in the telecommunications industry than the airlines sector because of the difficulty to control and sometimes refuse network access to customers. Similarities that exist between the airline and telecom industries include a large sunk cost combined with low marginal cost, perishable inventory, reservations, pricing flexibility and the opportunity to <b>upsell.</b> Differences that present challenges for communications service providers include low-value transactions and overall network complexity. Suggested approaches to executing a successful yield management strategy include accurate network information collection, bandwidth capacity allocation that doesn’t impact service quality, the deployment of service management software such as real time policy and real-time charging, and using new marketing channels to target consumers [...] with innovative services.|$|E
50|$|Telemarketers {{working on}} behalf of {{telephone}} companies, attempting to either win back a customer or <b>upsell</b> a customer with more services, must ask the customer's consent before accessing the billing information or before using that information to offer an <b>upsell</b> or any change of services. Usually this is done {{at the beginning of}} a call from the telemarketer to the telephone subscriber.|$|E
50|$|<b>Upselling</b> is an {{established}} and widely utilised sales tool employed by service companies {{in order to}} increase the purchasing value of their customers (Kamakura, 2008). For instance, calling centres can be known to adopt both <b>upselling</b> and cross-selling because the consumer has reached out first, thus meaning they are more open to suggestions.|$|R

They also collect and analyze behavioral and transactional data.|$|E
50|$|<b>Upselling</b> is a sales {{technique}} where {{a seller}} induces the customer to purchase more expensive items, upgrades or other add-ons {{in an attempt}} to make a more profitable sale. While it usually involves marketing more profitable services or products, it can be simply exposing the customer to other options that were perhaps not considered. (A different technique is cross-selling in which a seller tries to sell something else.) In practice, large businesses usually combine <b>upselling</b> and cross-selling to maximize profit.|$|R
50|$|Another way of <b>upselling</b> is {{creating}} fear over {{the durability of}} the purchase, particularly effective on expensive items such as electronics, where an extended warranty can offer peace of mind.|$|R
30|$|In three explorative studies {{involving}} {{data from}} a mobile phone provider on customer-level demographics, contract history, customer service requests, and social media usage, we investigate the link among social media interactions with the firm and customers’ <b>upselling</b> behavior, churn, and service contacts. The results indicate that social media interactions indeed ease the <b>upselling</b> efforts and {{reduce the risk of}} churn. These positive effects offset the observed increases with regard to the number of service requests and the higher overall service cost. Thus, we ultimately find customers who interact with the brand on social media to be more profitable.|$|R
50|$|Although, like EDI, {{sales orders}} are {{processed}} online, with B2B e-commerce {{it is possible}} for customers to order occasionally and in irregular order quantities. Also, B2B e-commerce enables the display of many different types of detailed figures and images. It is possible to exhibit a full range of products or parts. Therefore, a web store provides the opportunity to cross- and <b>upsell.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Macintosh II and Macintosh SE {{were the}} first Apple {{computers}} since the Apple I to be sold without a keyboard. Instead the customer was offered {{the choice of the}} new ADB Apple Keyboard or the Apple Extended Keyboard as a separate purchase. Dealers could bundle a third-party keyboard or attempt to <b>upsell</b> a customer to the more expensive (and higher-profit) Extended Keyboard.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{intelligent}} shaping schemes {{can guarantee}} a particular Quality of Service (often measured in jitter, packet loss, and latency) for an application or a user while still allowing other traffic {{to use all}} remaining bandwidth. This allows ISPs to offer Differentiated services and to <b>upsell</b> existing services to subscribers (such as offering minimum-latency computer gaming for an additional fee on top of basic internet).|$|E
30|$|In Study 1, we use {{the data}} of all 334, 111 {{customers}} who {{signed up for a}} contract in the first 856  days after launch to analyze the effect of social media interactions on the <b>upselling</b> behavior of customers. Specifically, we consider customers’ decision to upgrade their product (for example, by adding a SMS flat rate or a data flat rate) to be the <b>upselling</b> behavior. The <b>upselling</b> behavior is a dichotomous (dependent) variable that solely considers the first service upgrade initiated by a customer. Based on the information of all social media activities of the customers on the company’s brand page, {{we use the}} two variables, pre-purchase interactions (which count all interactions on the brand page before becoming a customer) and post-purchase interactions (which include all interactions on the brand page after becoming a customer), as focal independent variables. This appears to be appropriate because previous research has shown that the post-acquisition social influence helps customers re-affirm or validate their initial choice (e.g., Donnelly and Ivancevich 1970; Mudambi and Schuff 2010).|$|R
30|$|Considering companies’ {{uncertainty}} {{regarding the}} revenue and cost implications of social media interactions, {{we report on}} three empirical analyses that investigate the effect social media interactions have on customers’ <b>upselling</b> behavior, churn, and service contacts.|$|R

50|$|Most {{cocktails and}} mixed drinks that contain whiskey are made using {{economically}} priced blended whiskey rather than higher priced whiskey, since {{the presence of}} the other ingredients makes the subtleties of the taste of the whiskey less critical to the overall taste of the drink. However, drinks establishments will often <b>upsell</b> the use of a premium top-shelf liquor in mixed drinks for better taste (and higher revenue).|$|E

5000|$|Speaking to Business Insider in 2016, Puzder {{said that}} {{increased}} automation {{could be a}} welcome development because machines were [...] "always polite, they always <b>upsell,</b> they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there's never a slip-and-fall or an age, sex, or race discrimination case.". However, Puzder does not advocate completely removing humans from the [...] "fast food equation," [...] and has mentioned several drawbacks to increased automation, including detrimental effects on customer service and difficulty in building company culture.|$|E

5000|$|Result: Eventus won, {{finishing}} with a $567.60 profit against Pinnacle's $194.70. Eventus gained an advantage by producing their pies (vegetable curry) {{for less than}} Pinnacle (roast lamb and potato), sticking to fixed pricing strategies, and by arranging <b>upsells</b> [...] with free T-shirts. Eventus were cautioned for falsely marketing their pies as 'home-made'.|$|R
50|$|The {{value add}} {{may not be}} {{initially}} apparent in the sales overview and is often tied to <b>upselling</b> or vertical selling within a specific market segment. The utility of the product or service, ease of integration into the customers business operations, or time saving benefits {{are just a few}} areas that may be exploited when focusing on value add.|$|R
50|$|For an <b>upsell</b> to be successful, {{a seller}} must give a {{detailed}} demonstration, {{to show how}} the product will benefit the customer. An example could be seen as booking a hotel room for your family, then being offered a premium package, which is although more expensive includes breakfast and dinner for the entire family. This would mean that they would “save” by not spending money on fancy restaurants and take-outs. The benefit is given to the customer answering the question, “why should they change their minds?” And the total amount of the sale increases.|$|E
5000|$|PSGN’s newest feature, Performance Optimization Platform ("POP!" [...] for short) {{which lets}} {{developers}} quickly add dynamic touch points in-game to continuously test and optimize engagement and monetization {{without having to}} re-publish their game.

POP is designed to automatically run multivariate tests based {{on the success of}} the various actions/responses created throughout the game.|$|E
50|$|For a {{successful}} <b>upsell</b> to take place, the salesperson must be properly equipped and prepared. In a business sense, a sales assistant must know their product. Because the seller is representing {{the company or}} organisation; a customer expects a sales assistant to answer their questions and provide solutions to their problems. If a seller is unable to do so, it {{could result in a}} damaged relationship with the customer, a tarnished reputation for the brand and can also influence the sale negatively. Customers are more likely to trust salespeople who are confident in what they are selling.|$|E
50|$|Losing team: Net Worth. Tana wasted {{several hours}} {{traveling}} {{to and from}} Staten Island to buy beads and accessories to attach to their T-shirts, while Alex failed to effectively market.

25|$|<b>Upselling</b> {{and cross}} selling are {{sometimes}} known as suggestive selling. When the consumer has selected their main purchase, sales assistants {{can try to}} sell the customer on a premium brand or higher quality item (up-selling) or can suggest complementary purchases (cross-selling). For instance, if a customer purchases a non-stick frypan, the sales assistant might suggest plastic slicers that do not damage the non-stick surface.|$|R
50|$|Catalog merchants {{can accept}} orders from {{customers}} electronically, via the customer's mobile device. In some cases, the merchant may even deliver the catalog electronically, rather than mailing a paper catalog to the customer.
