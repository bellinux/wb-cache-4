5|$|Like Eliurus, Voalavo has {{moderately}} high-crowned (hypsodont) molars with crowns that consist not {{of discrete}} cusps, but of transverse laminae (plates) that generally lack longitudinal connections. However, Eliurus molars are slightly more hypsodont {{than those of}} Voalavo. The third upper and lower molars are smaller relative to the second molars in Voalavo than in Eliurus. Perhaps as a consequence, the upper third molar lacks discrete laminae in Voalavo, and the lower third molar has only two laminae (three in Eliurus). There are three roots <b>under</b> <b>each</b> upper molar and two <b>under</b> <b>each</b> lower.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was capable of}} performing dive bombing, and could be fitted with a single bomb or depth charge on a hardpoint <b>under</b> <b>each</b> wing for the mission, or for anti-submarine warfare. Gun armament consisted of two M2 Browning machine guns, one mounted in a fixed position firing forwards through the propeller using synchronizer gear, while the other was in a flexible position in the observer's cockpit for rear defense.|$|E
5|$|At 13:29 {{the first}} Ju 87s took off. By 13:45 all were in {{formation}} and beginning the 85-mile trip. Major Helmut Bode led III./StG 77 to Poling. He {{knew nothing of}} the technicalities of his target. Behind him was Hauptmann Alfons Orthofer's II./StG 77 bound for Ford. After them, Hauptmann Herbert Meisel's III Gruppe was heading on {{the left of the}} formation for Thorney Island. Hauptmann Walter Seigel's I./StG 3 headed for Gosport on the extreme left. Each Ju 87 was loaded with 550-lb bombs under the main fuselage and four 11-lb bombs and two <b>under</b> <b>each</b> wing. The Bf 109s would not take off for some time. The long trip and low speed of the Ju 87s meant there was plenty of time to catch up without burning fuel keeping close contact with the Stukas.|$|E

5|$|Otters are {{the only}} marine animals {{that are capable of}} lifting and turning over rocks, which they often do with their front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into {{underwater}} mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. <b>Under</b> <b>each</b> foreleg, sea otters have a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and clams, an example of tool use. The sea otters eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. Marine otters mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.|$|E
5|$|Six {{external}} hardpoints {{were located}} {{along the bottom}} of the helicopter, with two <b>under</b> <b>each</b> wing and two on the fuselage under the sponsons. The two inner wing hardpoints could carry pods of three TOW anti-tank missiles. 2.75-inch (70mm) rockets in 7-rocket or 19-rocket launchers could be carried on the four wing hardpoints. The two fuselage mounts were dedicated to carrying external fuel tanks. The wing hardpoints were also plumbed to allow the carriage of additional fuel tanks if required.|$|E

The earliest important match that is designated inter-county was in 1709 {{and the traditional}} county soon became the key unit of organisation. Until 1725, only nine counties (plus London which has on occasion been equated in status with the counties of Middlesex and Surrey for cricketing purposes) had been mentioned in surviving records in connection with cricket and the earliest mention of each is summarised below.

5|$|The slender teeth had {{slightly}} curved crowns, {{which were}} oval in cross-section. The {{teeth in the}} lower jaw may have been 20–30% smaller {{than those in the}} upper jaw, but few are known, and they are of uncertain maturity. Apart from this, the teeth were identical. <b>Under</b> <b>each</b> active tooth there was a column of nine replacement teeth within the jaw. With 68 columns in the upper jaws and 60 columns in the lower jaws, these so-called dental batteries (also present in hadrosaurs and ceratopsians) comprised a total of more than 500 active and replacement teeth. Dental batteries erupted in unison, not each column individually. The enamel on the teeth of Nigersaurus was highly asymmetrical, ten times thicker on the outwards facing side than on the inner side. This condition is otherwise known only in advanced ornithischians.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the Valiant fleet because of metal fatigue in December 1964 meant that the RAF had no front line tanker aircraft, so the B.1/1A aircraft, now judged to be surplus in the strategic bomber role, were refitted for this duty. To get some tankers into service as quickly as possible, six B.1A aircraft were converted to B(K).1A standard (later redesignated B.1A (K2P)), receiving a two-point system with a hose and drogue carried <b>under</b> <b>each</b> wing, while the bomb bay remained available for weapons. Handley Page worked day and night to convert these six aircraft, with the first being delivered on 28 April 1965, and 55 Squadron becoming operational in the tanker role in August 1965.|$|E
5|$|<b>Under</b> <b>each</b> foreleg, the {{sea otter}} has a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest. In this pouch (preferentially the left one), the animal stores {{collected}} food {{to bring to}} the surface. This pouch also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams. There, the sea otter eats while floating on its back, using its forepaws to tear food apart and bring it to its mouth. It can chew and swallow small mussels with their shells, whereas large mussel shells may be twisted apart. It uses its lower incisor teeth to access the meat in shellfish.|$|E

5|$|Further missionaries {{were sent}} from Rome in 601. They brought a pallium for Augustine and a present of sacred vessels, vestments, relics, and books. The pallium was {{the symbol of}} {{metropolitan}} status, and signified that Augustine was now an archbishop unambiguously associated with the Holy See. Along with the pallium, a letter from Gregory directed the new archbishop to consecrate 12 suffragan bishops {{as soon as possible}} and to send a bishop to York. Gregory's plan was that there would be two metropolitans, one at York and one at London, with 12 suffragan bishops <b>under</b> <b>each</b> archbishop. As part of this plan, Augustine was expected to transfer his archiepiscopal see to London from Canterbury. The move from Canterbury to London never happened; no contemporary sources give the reason, but it was probably because London was not part of Æthelberht's domains. Instead, London was part of the kingdom of Essex, ruled by Æthelberht's nephew Saebert of Essex, who converted to Christianity in 604. The historian S. Brechter has suggested that the metropolitan see was indeed moved to London, and that it was only with the abandonment of London as a see after the death of Æthelberht that Canterbury became the archiepiscopal see. This theory contradicts Bede's version of events, however.|$|E
5|$|Girih are {{elaborate}} interlacing patterns formed of five standardized shapes. The {{style is}} used in Persian Islamic architecture and also in decorative woodwork. Girih designs are traditionally made in different media including cut brickwork, stucco, and mosaic faience tilework. In woodwork, especially in the Safavid period, it could be applied either as lattice frames, left plain or inset with panels such as of coloured glass; or as mosaic panels used to decorate walls and ceilings, whether sacred or secular. In architecture, girih forms decorative interlaced strapwork surfaces from the 15thcentury to the 20thcentury. Most designs {{are based on a}} partially hidden geometric grid which provides a regular array of points; this is made into a pattern using 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotational symmetries which can fill the plane. The visible pattern superimposed on the grid is also geometric, with 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-pointed stars and a variety of convex polygons, joined by straps which typically seem to weave over and <b>under</b> <b>each</b> other. The visible pattern does not coincide with the underlying tiling.|$|E
5|$|On the battlefield, the king's commanders led the troops. The empire's war {{strategy}} rarely involved massive invasions; {{more often}} it employed small scale {{methods such as}} attacking and destroying individual forts. The empire {{was among the first}} in India to use long range artillery commonly manned by foreign gunners (those from present day Turkmenistan were considered the best). Army troops were of two types: The king's personal army directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army <b>under</b> <b>each</b> feudatory. King Krishnadevaraya's personal army consisted of 100,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalrymen and over 900 elephants. This number was only a part of the army numbering over 1.1 million soldiers, a figure that varied as an army of two million has also been recorded along with the existence of a navy as evidenced by {{the use of the term}} Navigadaprabhu (commander of the navy). The army recruited from all classes of society (supported by the collection of additional feudal tributes from feudatory rulers), and consisted of archers and musketeers wearing quilted tunics, shieldmen with swords and poignards in their girdles, and soldiers carrying shields so large that no armour was necessary. The horses and elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their tusks to do maximum damage in battle.|$|E

5|$|Rocket bombs, {{aerodynamic}} {{wings and}} explosive payloads: The first known rockets fitted with aerodynamic wings {{are described as}} the 'flying crows with magic fire' in the oldest strata of the Huolongjing (early-to-mid 14th century), compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The body of the rocket was shaped like a bird (specifically a crow), packed with gunpowder, and made of bamboo laths forming a long basketwork frame that was reinforced with glued paper. A decorative head and tail were attached {{to the front and}} back ends, while the wings were nailed to the sides. <b>Under</b> <b>each</b> wing were two slanting rockets to propel the weapon; a main fuse was lit that ignited a fourfold fuse connected to each rocket and running through a drilled hole {{in the back of the}} bird. The book then claims that the rocket, after being launched high into the air and aimed at encampments or enemy boats, automatically produced an explosion upon impact that could be seen from considerably long distances.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the club}} was founded, there have been 30 managers. The honours won by the club <b>under</b> <b>each</b> manager's {{stewardship}} are also detailed. As of {{the start of the}} 2017 season, 28 men have held the post of Malmö FF manager, the most successful of whom in terms of trophies won is Bob Houghton, who, as manager between 1974 and 1980, led the club to three Swedish league championships and four Svenska Cupen wins. The manager who has won most national league titles with the club is Antonio Durán, who won Allsvenskan four times between 1964 and 1971. Although Roy Hodgson led Malmö FF to the Allsvenskan crown five times in a row between 1985 and 1989, the national championship was decided by a championship play-off during this time, and Malmö FF only won this in 1986 and 1988. Houghton is the club's longest-serving manager, having occupied the position between 1990 and 1992 in addition to the aforementioned period, giving him a total of 10 years in charge. The current manager of Malmö FF is Magnus Pehrsson, who has been at the club since 23 November 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole {{in the back of her}} neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs <b>under</b> <b>each</b> armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E

5|$|The four lower cheekteeth—the fourth lower premolar (p4) {{and first}} through third lower molars (m1–m3)—are high-crowned teeth. Like the upper teeth, they bear four cusps (metaconid, protoconid, entoconid, and hypoconid), four lophs (metalophid, mesolophid, hypolophid, and posterolophid) and three valleys. Each {{of the lower}} cheekteeth lacks an {{additional}} loph, the ectolophid, which is present in Arikareeomys. The p4 is larger {{than any of the}} molars and longer than it is wide. Among the molars, m1 and m2 do not differ appreciably from each other and are a little wider than they are long, while m3 is a little smaller and its back side is more rounded and narrower. Syncline IV, which is located {{at the back of the}} tooth, between the hypolophid and posterolophid, is closed at the margins; this valley is open in Megapeomys bobwilsoni. Syncline IV also opens into the centrally located syncline III; this opening is absent in Arikareeomys. There are two roots under p4 and three <b>under</b> <b>each</b> of the molars, fewer than in Megapeomys bobwilsoni, which shows three under p4 and four under the molars.|$|E
5|$|The leopard {{catshark}} is {{the smaller}} and slimmer {{of the two}} Poroderma species. The head and snout are short and slightly flattened, with a somewhat pointed snout tip. Each nostril is split into tiny incurrent and excurrent openings by a three-lobed flap of skin in front, of which the central lobe forms a slender barbel that reaches past the mouth. The horizontally oval eyes are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and placed rather high on the head, with a thick ridge running <b>under</b> <b>each.</b> The mouth is wide and arched, with short furrows at the corners extending onto both jaws; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. There are 1830 and 1326 tooth rows {{on either side of}} the upper and lower jaws respectively. The teeth have a narrow central cusp with a pair of small lateral cusplets; those of adult males are slightly more curved than those of females.|$|E
5|$|The monks' {{dormitory}} {{was on the}} {{top floor}} of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one <b>under</b> <b>each</b> of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.|$|E
