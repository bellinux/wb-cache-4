60|$|NICHOLLS (suddenly panic-stricken by the {{prospect}} of facing her). No--no--I can't stay--I only came for a moment--I've got an appointment--honestly. Besides, it isn't right for her to be <b>up.</b> <b>She's</b> too weak. It'll make her worse. You should have told her.|$|R

5|$|Eagle was {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Fleet on 7June 1924 after she commissioned on 26 February and finished working <b>up.</b> <b>She</b> was the largest aircraft carrier in the world at the time and embarked 24 aircraft in four six-aircraft flights of the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force.

5|$|One {{of the men}} {{helps the}} girl <b>up,</b> <b>she</b> spreads her wings and gives them a {{grateful}} smile; he kisses her hand, and the other winks in farewell. Soon, she is gone drifting upward into the sky. Briefly, a major urban cityscape is seen beyond the trees. From a bird's-eye view, we see {{the shape of the}} car veering off the road and slowing to a stop in the grass.|$|E
5|$|The scene changes again, now to bright {{daylight}} and blue sky. Two men are driving an old Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider passo corto down an empty road.

With a nudge she is airborne, but she seems hesitant and afraid as he lets go.|$|E

5|$|After {{undergoing}} substantial repairs, Temeraire {{was employed}} blockading the French fleets and supporting British operations off the Spanish coasts. She {{went out to}} the Baltic in 1809, defending convoys against Danish gunboat attacks, and by 1810 was off the Spanish coast again, helping to defend Cadiz against a French army. Her last action was against the French off Toulon, when she came under fire from shore batteries. The ship returned to Britain in 1813 for repairs, but was laid <b>up.</b> <b>She</b> was converted to a prison ship and moored in the River Tamar until 1819. Further service brought her to Sheerness as a receiving ship, then a victualling depot, and finally a guard ship. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1838, and she was towed up the Thames to be broken up.|$|E
5|$|Ann Bannon {{was born}} Ann Weldy in Joliet, Illinois, in 1932. She {{grew up in}} nearby Hinsdale {{with her mother and}} stepfather, and had the {{responsibility}} of taking care of four siblings due to the family's financial problems. She took comfort in a vibrant imaginary life during this time and found solace in writing. Growing <b>up,</b> <b>she</b> was surrounded by music, particularly jazz, as her family hosted small recitals for friends and neighbors. One became a character in her books: a perennial bachelor named Jack who slung jokes and witticisms at the audiences.|$|E

5000|$|Since then, Wapner has stated, [...] "She is {{a disgrace}} to the profession. She does things I don't think a judge should do. She tells people to shut <b>up.</b> <b>She's</b> rude. She's arrogant. She demeans people. If she does this on purpose, then that's even worse. Judges need to observe certain {{standards}} of conduct. She just doesn't do it and I resent that. The public is apt to gain the impression that this is how actual judges conduct themselves. It says judge on the nameplate {{on the bench and}} she's wearing a robe." ...|$|R

5|$|By 13 January, {{all of the}} French fleet {{had been}} {{accounted}} for except the small brig Mutine, which was blown {{all the way to}} Santa Cruz and was captured there in July, and the 74-gun Droits de l'Homme. Droits de l'Homme had been among the ships under Bouvet in Bantry Bay and then with those that carried on to the Shannon, but as the fleet broke <b>up</b> <b>she</b> became separated. With provisions running low and landings still impossible, Captain Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse determined to return to France independently. Progress was slow as Droits de l'Homme was overloaded with 1,300 men, including 800 soldiers under General Jean Humbert. She was further delayed when she encountered and captured a small British privateer named Cumberland. As a result, La Crosse had only reached Ushant by 13 January, where he encountered the same fog that had enabled Révolution and Fraternité to reach safety.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the ship was in poor shape and {{required}} an extensive refit; the work last from 12 November to 17 May 1944 at the North Woolwich, London shipyard of Harland and Wolff. After working <b>up,</b> <b>she</b> {{was assigned to the}} 14th Escort Group for anti-submarine operations in the Western Approaches. Duncan conducted convoy escort and anti-submarine operations with the group through April 1945 when she was assigned to the Greenock Coastal Escort Pool. The ship was placed in reserve on 13 May and was transferred to Barrow on 9 June. She approved for immediate disposal on 8 July as she was leaking five tons of water a day. Duncan was turned over to BISCO for scrapping immediately afterwards, but demolition was not completed until 1949.|$|E
5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing <b>up.</b> <b>She</b> did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E

Mulder calls Scully {{on the phone and}} hears her being knocked out by Chaco. She is taken to a secluded field, where Harold has started a bonfire and led the townsfolk in consuming Doris. Chaco berates them for killing one of their own, but Harold chastises him for allowing the Creutzfeldt–Jakob epidemic to occur and has Chaco executed by the masked figure. Scully herself is about to be killed when Mulder arrives and shoots the figure; he is revealed to be Sheriff Arens. Harold tries to shoot Mulder, but is trampled to death by the fleeing townsfolk.|$|E
5|$|During the arc, Rukia's past is explored. She died as {{an infant}} and was sent to Soul Society with her older sister, Hisana. Though Hisana {{initially}} tried to protect and provide for Rukia, she could not ensure her own survival while caring for a baby as well, and thus abandoned Rukia. As Rukia grew <b>up,</b> <b>she</b> befriended Renji Abarai, and entered the Soul Reaper academy, where she was adopted into the Kuchiki family. One year prior to the adoption, Hisana died after asking her husband, Byakuya, to find and adopt Rukia as his sister. This remains unknown to Rukia until Byakuya confesses it to her. When she was accepted into the 13th Division, Rukia befriended the lieutenant of her division, Kaien Shiba, and trained under him. During {{the course of a}} mission, Kaien was irreversibly possessed by a hollow and Rukia inadvertently kills him.|$|E
