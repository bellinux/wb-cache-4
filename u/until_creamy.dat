5000|$|A Victoria sponge is {{made using}} one of two methods. [...] The {{traditional}} method involves creaming caster sugar with fat (usually butter), mixing thoroughly with beaten egg, then folding flour and raising agent into the mixture. The modern method, using an electric mixer or food processor, involves simply whisking all the ingredients together <b>until</b> <b>creamy.</b> [...] Additionally, the modern method typically uses an extra raising agent, and some recipes call for an extra-soft butter or margarine. Both the traditional and modern methods are relatively quick and simple, producing consistent results, making this type of mixture {{one of the most}} popular for children and people in a hurry. This basic [...] "cake" [...] mixture has been made into a wide variety of treats and puddings, including cupcakes, chocolate cake, and Eve's pudding.|$|E

50|$|Place the flour, baking powder, {{salt and}} mace {{in a medium}} bowl. Stir with a wire whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl of an {{electric}} mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix <b>until</b> <b>creamy.</b> Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts.|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} sperm preservation, {{influenced by}} the capability of its extender on the maintenance the sperm quality during storage. The carbohydrate such as glucose and fructose were the common sugar added on the mammalian sperm extender to support their live and motility. The sucrose was the main carbohydrate in Timor deer stag seminal plasma. The experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of carbohydrates in Tris egg yolk (TEY) extender on the motility and viability of stag sperm, stored in room temperature (27 - 28 oC). The semen was collected using electro ejaculator from five Timor deer stags at hard antler stage, 3 - 5 years old, body weight of 64 - 102 kg with normal testes. The semen was than evaluated macro-and microscopically and divided into 3 aliquots. Each of them was diluted with TEY-glucose (TEYG), TEY-fructose (TEYF) and TEY-Sucrose (TEYS) with the concentration of spermatozoa 100 x 106 ml- 1. The extended semen was than stored at room temperature. The sperm motility and viability were evaluated every 3 hours. Result of the experiment showed that the semen volume was 2. 06 ± 0. 63 ml, pH 7. 03 ± 0. 13, yellow white <b>until</b> <b>creamy</b> in color and the consistency ranged from normal to thick. The mass movement between ++ to +++ and the sperm motility was 68. 67 ± 7. 4...|$|E
5000|$|Seng-phe and Halawa [...] These {{are typical}} sweets {{of the people}} of Thai Yai. ‘Seng-phe’ looks like red sticky rice conserve, cooked from sticky rice, {{sugarcane}} juice and coconut milk, and baked or grilled <b>until</b> its coconut <b>creamy</b> topping turns brown. ‘Halawa’ is cooked from rice flour, granulated sugar, coconut milk, and tapioca, and topped with coconut cream like Seng-phe.

50|$|Chopped onions, {{water and}} salt, are boiled {{in a pot}} for about 10 minutes, and then let cool down. The pork fat is whipped <b>until</b> it turns <b>creamy</b> and a much lighter color, then the eggs are added one by one along pieces of fresh cheese, all without stop whipping. The boiled onions are added to this creamy preparation, and also the grains of corn (that have been {{previously}} mollified) and the milk.|$|R
