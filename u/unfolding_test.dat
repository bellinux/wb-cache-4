40|$|The natural {{remanent}} magnetizations of 35 {{samples from}} five quarries in the Permian traps from the Exeter region were carefully examined. A {{considerable number of}} the samples contained a secondary magnetism, the intensity of which was directly proportional to the susceptibility. This secondary magnetism (probably of viscous origin) was completely eliminated with a. c. magnetic fields up to 400 Oe. Only the samples from one quarry (Killerton) had in addition much harder secondary magnetism. Besides, all traps contained a harder remanent magnetization whose direction was similar in all samples and thus characteristic for these Exeter traps. This characteristic magnetization mostly was composed of a soft and a hard component. Both components differ very slightly in direction. The intensity of the soft characteristic magnetization did not vary much from sample to sample, but that of the hard characteristic magnetization varied inversely {{as that of the}} secondary (viscous) magnetization. When the <b>unfolding</b> <b>test</b> was applied to the mean characteristic magnetization directions of the localities the circle of confidence decreased from 17 ° to 6 °, so this remanent magnetization was acquired before folding took place. It is supposed that this characteristic, pre-tilting remanent magnetization is the fossil primary remanence. It indicates a mean local geomagnetic field direction of D = 198 °, I = − 25 °, corresponding to a virtual pole at 49. 5 °N 148. 5 °E.

40|$|First {{measurements}} {{are made of}} the underlying event in calorimeter jet events at the LHC, using 37 pb- 1 of pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV, recorded during 2010 by the ATLAS detector. Results are compared for an assumed di-jet topology based on a single identified jet, and an exclusive di-jet requirement. The number of charged particles in the azimuthal region transverse to the jet axis is recorded, {{as well as their}} total and average transverse momentum. The total energy carried by all particles - charged and neutral - is also calculated, using the full calorimeter acceptance |η| < 4 : 8. Distributions are constructed to show the variation of these quantities versus the transverse momentum of the selected jet, over the range 20 - 800 GeV. Additional jets in the transverse region are shown to dramatically influence the measured activity. Software is developed to perform Bayesian iterative <b>unfolding,</b> <b>testing</b> closure of the process and stability with respect to the number of iterations performed. Pseudo-experiments are used to propagate systematic errors, and the intrinsic error due to unfolding is estimated. Although the correction relies on a prior probablitity distribution, model-dependence is reduced to an uncertainty comparable to or smaller than experimental systematic errors. The software is used to correct underlying event measurements for effects introduced by the ATLAS detector. Unfolded results are compared to predictions from different Monte Carlo event generators used in LHC analyses, showing general agreement in the range |η| < 2 : 5, but discrepancies in the forward region.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{associate}} to every z-calculus agent an it-redundant unfolding, i. e., a labeled transition system {{equipped with the}} ordinary notion of strong bisimilarity, so that agents are mapped into strongly bisimilar unfoldings {{if and only if}} they are early strongly bisim-ilar. For a class of finitary agents (that strictly contains the finite control agents) without matching, the corresponding unfoldings are finite and can be built efficiently. The main consequence of the results presented in the paper is that the irredundant unfolding can be constructed also for a single agent, and then a minimal realization can be derived from it em-ploying the ordinary partition refinement algorithm. Instead, according to previous results only pairs of r-calculus agents could be <b>unfolded</b> and <b>tested</b> for bisimilarity, and no minimization of a single agent was possi-ble.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The apomyoglobin {{molten globule}} has a complex, partly folded {{structure}} with a folded A[B]-GH subdomain; the factors determining its stability {{are not yet}} known in detail. AlafGly mutations, made at solvent-exposed positions, are used to probe the role of helix propensity of individual helices in stabilizing the molten globule. Molten globule stability is measured by reversible urea unfolding, monitored both by circular dichroism and by tryptophan fluorescence. Two-state <b>unfolding</b> is <b>tested</b> by superposition of these two unfolding curves, and stability data are reported only for variants which satisfy the superposition test. Results for sites Q 8 in the A helix and E 109 in the G helix confirm that the helix propensities of the A and G helices both strongly affect molten globule stability, in contrast to results for the G 65 A/G 73 A double mutant which show that changing the helix propensity of the E-helix sequence has no significant stabilizing effect. Changing the helix propensity of the B-helix sequence with the G 23 A/G 25 A double mutant affects molten globule stability to an intermediate extent, confirming an earlier report that this mutant has increased stability.

As a protein unfolds, nanometer-scale increases in distance between donor and acceptor fluorophores cause decreases in FRET. Here we demonstrate the application of FRET to imaging coexisting conformations of fibronectin (Fn) in cell culture. Fn is a flexible 440 -kDa extracellular matrix protein, with functional sites that are regulated by unfolding events. Fn was labeled with multiple donor and acceptor fluorophores such that intramolecular FRET {{could be used to}} distinguish a range of Fn conformations. The sensitivity of FRET to <b>unfolding</b> was <b>tested</b> by progressively denaturing labeled Fn using guanidium chloride. To investigate Fn conformation changes during cell binding and matrix assembly, we added labeled Fn to the culture medium of NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts. Coexisting conformations of Fn were visualized using fluorescence microscopy, and spectra from specific features were measured with an attached spectrometer. Using FRET as an indicator of Fn conformation, Fn diffusely bound to cells was in a compact state, whereas Fn in matrix fibrils was highly extended. Matrix fibrils exhibited a range of FRET that suggested some degree of unfolding of Fn's globular modules. Fn in cell-associated clusters that preceded fibril formation appeared more extended than diffuse cell-bound Fn but less extended than fibrillar Fn, suggesting that Fn undergoes extension after cell binding and before polymerization. FRET thus provides an approach to gain insight into the integrin-mediated pathway of Fn fibrillogenesis...|$|R

In the present communication, the interaction of liver cystatin with anti-cancer (adriamycin) and anti-hepatitis (adevofir dipivoxil) drugs was studied by thiol-protease inhibitory assay, UV absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism (CD). A static type of quenching was observed between the protein and the drug molecules. Binding constant (Ka) of adriamycin to liver cystatin (LC) was found to be 1. 08 × 106 M− 1.

These data were {{used to calculate the}} distance between specific residues in the folded state, and in a sequence of extended states defined by n = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 residue units. Exact calculations carried out for each of the 103 residues in the polypeptide chain demonstrate that different regions of the chain have different unfolding histories. Regions where there is a persistence of compact structures can be identified, and this geometrical characterization is fully consistent with analyses of time-resolved fluorescence energy-transfer (TrFET) data using dansyl-derivatized cysteine side-chain probes at positions 39, 50, 66, 85, and 99.

In light of experimental evidence showing that this assumption is invalid for many proteins, and with increasing awareness that the unfolded state is more structured and compact than previously thought, a detailed examination of electrostatic effects in unfolded proteins is warranted. Here we address this issue with structure-based {{calculations of}} electrostatic interactions in unfolded staphylococcal nuclease. The approach involves the generation of ensembles of structures representing the unfolded state, and calculation of Coulomb energies to Boltzmann weight the unfolded state ensembles. Four different structural models of the <b>unfolded</b> state were <b>tested.</b> Experimental proton binding data measured with a variant of nuclease that is unfolded under native conditions were used to establish {{the validity of the}} calculations. These calculations suggest that weak Coulomb interactions are an unavoidable property of unfolded proteins. At neutral pH, the interactions are too weak to organize the unfolded state; however, at extreme pH values, where the protein has a significant net charge, the combined action {{of a large number of}} weak repulsive interactions can lead to the expansion of the unfolded state. The calculated pK a values of ionizable groups in the unfolded state are similar but not identical to the values in small peptides in water. These studies suggest that the accuracy of structure-based calculations of electrostatic contributions to stability cannot be improved unless electrostatic effects in the unfolded state are calculated explicitly...|$|R

Host genetic influence of HIV infection has been previously studied in HIV- 1 B, but {{little attention has been}} paid to the more prevalent subtype C. To understand the role of host genetics in HIV- 1 C disease progression, we perform a study to assess the association between longitudinally collected measures of disease and more than 100, 000 genetic markers located on chromosome 6. The most common approach to analyzing longitudinal data in this context is linear mixed effects models, which may be overly simplistic in this case. On the other hand, existing non-parametric methods may suffer from low power due to high degrees of freedom (DF) and may be computationally infeasible at the large scale. We propose a functional principal variance component (FPVC) testing framework which captures the nonlinearity in the CD 4 and viral load with potentially low DF and is fast enough to carry out thousands or millions of times. The FPVC <b>testing</b> <b>unfolds</b> in two stages. In the first stage, we summarize the markers of disease progression according to their major patterns of variation via functional principal components analysis (FPCA). In the second stage, we employ a simple working model and variance component testing to examine the association between the summaries of disease progression and a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms. We supplement this analysis with simulation results which indicate that FPVC testing can offer large power gains over the standard linear mixed effects model. Comment: 20 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

Slowly revealed is {{the location and}} the occupation of those before the camera; students and tutors from the Manchester School of Art in the 1930 ’s. Beautiful and poignant as Screen Tests is, the film also addresses issues embedded in {{the political economy of}} creativity. There is conflict blossoming at the heart of culture, a conflict convened around the property rights that subsist in materials stored in public archives. Screen Tests explores this conflict, while enriching rather than depleting the public domain. The British Art Show is a five yearly ‘survey’ of influential recent British Art, coordinated by the Hayward Gallery London, and touring four British cities. Marysia Lewandowska and Neil Cummings were commissioned by the curators to make a ‘context-specific’ new work. While doing research for the commission, we realized that each of the host cities houses a regional public Media, Film and Television Archive. We intended to source out-of-copyright archival film from which to edit four new films - one for each city of the exhibitions tour. We collaborated with Ben White and Eileen Simpson, and while working with the film archives we discovered a conflict blossoming at the heart of culture, a conflict convened around the property rights that subsist in materials stored in public archives. Film archives routinely use Intellectual Property regimes, to sell reproduction rights to their holdings; turning public resources into commercial revenue streams. 'Screen Tests' explored the conflict between private rights management and the idea of a public domain. We negotiated the release of all our films and the original archival source material, under Creative Commons licenses. These licences grant rights to others, to use, modify and redistribute the work. 'Screen Tests' therefore replaces a model of cultural reproduction based on restriction and scarcity, with one based on the gift and generosity; it was freely available at exhibition venues...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of diseases are associated with protein misfolding, one type of which results {{in the formation of}} amyloid fibrils. This research has addressed the hypothesis that all proteins can form amyloid fibrils and investigates what factors protect proteins from forming these macromolecular assemblies. Most analyses of the aggregation propensity of proteins have been limited to the properties of the amino acid sequence, thus fail to consider the roles that higher levels of organisation play in protecting polypeptides from misfolding. The (α/β) 8 barrels are a common class of proteins and have never been shown to form amyloid fibrils. This thesis aims to elucidate the characteristics that prevent (α/β) 8 barrels from misfolding using Escherichia coli dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS), a homotetrameric (α/β) 8 barrel protein, as a model. It is widely accepted that the precursor of amyloid fibrils is a partially folded species. It is hypothesised in this thesis that the (α/β) 8 barrel fold protects the protein against this partial <b>unfolding.</b> This was <b>tested</b> by generating a catalogue of site-directed mutants of DHDPS and screening each of these in a range of pHs and ionic strengths. Amorphous aggregation propensity was assessed by monitoring light scattering at 340 nm and β-sheet specific aggregation was assessed using ThT. Thermal stability was monitored using DSF and CD spectroscopy. Crystallography was used to assess tertiary and quaternary structures and in the cases where crystal structures were not obtained, kinetics was used as a proxy indicator of correct folding and monomeric association. CD spectroscopy was also used to investigate the secondary structure of the DHDPS variants and analytical gel permeation liquid chromatography and AUC were used to confirm quaternary structure. The stability and aggregation propensity of DHDPS and its variants were assessed under a range of pH and salt conditions. It was established through the characterisation of the wild-type protein that the predominant determinant of stability was, unsurprisingly, pH. This was a trend observed for all the variants described. Affinity tags were used {{during the course of this}} research to facilitate and expedite the production of the protein variants. The introduction of tags containing a polyhistidine motif to DHDPS significantly altered some biophysical properties. Whilst the secondary and quaternary structures were found to be similar to the wild-type enzyme, the catalytic properties were changed. In addition to this, the propensity to aggregate was altered. The full-length polyhistidine tags increased the propensity of DHDPS to form β-sheet-specific aggregate, although this did not result in the formation of amyloid fibrils for most of the variants. The Zyggregator algorithm was used to predict amino acid substitutions that would increase the aggregation propensity of DHDPS. It identified several amino acids, three of which were chosen for mutation and two of which were expressed in sufficient quantity for further study. DHDPS Q 90 L and A 207 V were characterised and the amino acid substitutions did not significantly alter the kinetic parameters of the enzyme. The crystal structure of A 207 V was solved and confirmed the results of the kinetic analysis demonstrating unchanged tertiary and quaternary structures. Both variants exhibited tertiary and quaternary structures similar to the wild-type enzyme, although Q 90 L contained more disorder than the wild-type enzyme. The thermal denaturation temperatures and aggregation propensities were also similar to wild-type, although the propensity for both variants to form β-sheet-specific aggregates was reduced. The combinatorial effects of Q 90 L, A 207 V and the polyhistidine tags were assessed. This revealed that whilst most biophysical properties were unaffected, the β-sheet-specific aggregation propensity for pET M 11 and pET 151 /D-TOPO DHDPS Q 90 L and pET M 11 DHDPS A 207 V, were significantly increased compared to the wild-type enzyme. The evolutionary forces driving the association of the monomeric and dimeric subunits of DHDPS are undetermined. Investigation of two quaternary structure mutants (DHDPS Y 107 W and L 197 Y) revealed that the tetrameric nature of E. coli DHDPS is important for protein activity, stability and the prevention of aggregation. The combinatorial affects of the disrupted quaternary structure and the polyhistidine tags further increased the predisposition of DHDPS to form β-sheet-specific aggregates, resulting in the formation of linear aggregates with some characteristics of amyloid fibrils. The additive affect of Q 90 L, Y 107 W and a polyhistidine tag was assessed and revealed that the major determinant in protein stability and prevention of amorphous and β-sheet specific aggregation is the quaternary structure. This study demonstrates that the destabilisation of the quaternary structure of DHDPS can result in the formation of amyloid-like aggregates by an (α/β) 8 barrel, the first example of an (α/β) 8 barrel misfolding in such a way. This finding supports the assertion that all proteins can form amyloid fibrils...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} common multisensory {{experiences}} in everyday life is eating. The flavour of a food is defined, in human brain, by a unique combination of taste, aroma, consistency, temperature, sounds and visual aspects. In this context, all the sensory properties of a product, i. e. not just the taste properties, influence our testing experience, as well as our tasting experiences can alter the perception of the other sensory properties. But even if some senses such as sight and taste have been deeply examined in this situation, other senses such as hearing still represents a quite unexplored potential in the current scientific research. The influence of auditory aspects on foods and drinks might take place at different stages of the food experience. In fact, auditory aspects typically considered as primarily perceived when we are consuming food (i. e. prime-coincident sounds such as first bite, or late-coincident sounds such as the mastication sound) have been proved affecting instead the food intake process even since the very first approach to food itself (i. e. anticipatory sounds such as the packaging sound) or after the food intake (i. e. post-prandial sounds such as those produced clearing the table). A first experimental test to explore the relation between consumption sound due to the food packaging and taste-perceived food qualities will be spread in this research presentation, in order to investigate this sound- taste connection, excluding the other senses. The first results of a test conducted on yogurt pots and jars will be presented. Three widely commercialized yogurt pots and jars characterized by a similar cylindrical meta-shape, but differing in materials (glass, clay and polypropylene, respectively) were selected as case studies. Thirty subjects mixed between experts in sensory analysis and naïve took part to the test. Each participant was asked to taste a spoon of yogurt under three different conditions, i. e. taking it from each one of the three packaging. Both the yogurt and the spoon used for the tasting were the same in the three conditions, and the food was submitted always at the same temperature. The <b>test</b> was <b>unfolded</b> in random order and each pot was hidden in a box in order to exclude the visual component. The pots were filled with a standardized little quantity of food, making the subject produce some noise with the spoon to the containers' sides to collect the yogurt from the pots. Before and after each test, subjects were asked to prepare themselves to the taste by eating a piece of cracker and drinking a sip of water. After each taste, a questionnaire was administrated to the participants, asking them to evaluate on a 1 to 9 -points Likert scale the tasted yogurts on the following items: sweetness, sourness, tastiness, thickness, genuineness, calorificness, craftsmanship and expensiveness. Median and interquartile ranges of the collected data were calculated, comparing the <b>test</b> <b>unfolded</b> with each yogurt pot. A first comparison on each attribute obtained with the three pots showed that little but significant differences can be observed in the evaluation of each item in relation with the sound variation. For example, yogurt seems to be perceived as sweeter when contained into the glass jar, rather than into the plastic or clay pots. Furthermore, the product is perceived also as more expensive when it is contained in glass or clay-sounding jars. Finally, clay-sounds seem to positively affect on craftsmanship and genuineness perception. A subsequent global comparison on the results of all the attributes obtained with the three pots confirmed how the sounds produced by spoons rubbing against the different jars affect on food perception by consumers. Finally, it can be assumed that both taste and quality perception can be influenced by packaging sounds. For this reason, several other studies can be hypothesized in future in order to further investigate these or other synaesthesia between sound and taste. The present experimental investigation and methodology shows how specific packaging sounds can affect differently on the overall food product perception. This finding entails cognitive nutrition as a support for designers dealing with the development of food packaging and food products: the methodology supports food stakeholders during the materials choice, the design phase and the product finalising. In fact, designers must be familiar with all available options if they wish to choose the right materials for his product early on in the design process; above all, they must be able to analyse whether or not the materials suit their product. Sound properties of a product (linked with gestures and product shapes, temperature, texture, colour and weight) are one of the invisible aspects of design that were proved being able to change the product perception, as well as to contribute to characterizing the user experience of a product that anticipates the consumers' desires, involving them in an all-around sensory experience...|$|R
