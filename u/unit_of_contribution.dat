40|$|AbstractGiven {{a linear}} design problem with {{multiple}} objectives and multiple resource availability levels, we first use the multi-criteria and multi-constraint level (MC 2) simplex method {{to identify a}} set of potentially good designs and to construct their corresponding contingency plans for coping with changes of resource availability levels and the <b>unit</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> selected products (opportunities). Then we use known techniques of decisionmaking under uncertainty to select the optimal design(s) from these potentially good designs and their contingency plans as the final decision. For some change <b>of</b> the <b>unit</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> selected products in a potentially good design, the potentially good design may not satisfy the optimality condition under consideration. To overcome the non-optimal situation, we must construct dual contingency plans to convert non-optimal solutions into optimal ones for the potentially good design. This paper discusses how to construct flexible dual contingency plans for potentially good designs in which the number of selected products made, the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> the products, and <b>units</b> <b>of</b> slack resources are flexibly adjusted to meet the optimality. Based on theoretical results, we propose a method of effectively and systematically identifying all potentially good designs and the corresponding flexible dual contingency plans under various decision situations...|$|R

Recently, however, there has a been a growing recognition of the contributions made by seniors to their families, communities and to society.

A critical {{review of the literature}} identifies unresolved issues concerning which contributions to count and how to measure and value these contributions. As yet, no clear criteria exist that readily identify the distinction between volunteer activities and unpaid work, what specifically should be counted as an unpaid time contribution, how it should be quantified, and how this <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> should be monetarily valued.

40|$|We extend {{previous}} {{estimates of}} the average marginal tax rate from the federal individual income tax to include social security "contributions. " The social security tax is a flat-rate levy on labor earnings (and income from self-employment) up to a ceiling value of earnings. Our computations consider first, the tax rates on employers, employees and the self-employed; second the amounts of income that accrue to persons with earnings below the ceiling; and third, the effective deductibility of employer's social security contributions from workers' taxable income. We find that the net impact of social security on the average marginal tax rate is below. 02 until 1966, but than rises to. 03 in 1968,. 04 in 1973,. 05 in 1974,and. 06 in 1979. Thus, since 1965, the overall average marginal tax rate rises more rapidly than that from the income tax alone. In 1980 this overall rate is 36 %. We note that, {{in comparison with the}} income tax, the social security levy generates 3 - 4 times as much revenue per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> to the average marginal tax rate. The social security tax is relatively "efficient" because first, it is a flat-rate tax (rather than a graduated one) for earnings below the ceiling, and second, there is a zero marginal tax rate at the top. However, the last feature has become less important in recent years. The rapid increase in the ceiling on earnings raised the fraction of total salaries and wages accruing to persons with earnings below the ceiling from 29 % in 1965 to 68 % in 1982. ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{findings}} in public good provision experiments via the voluntary contribution mechanism is that subjects contribute {{a considerable amount of}} their initial holdings to the provision of a public good even when no contribution is the dominant strategy [see Ledyard’s survey article (1995) ]. This seemingly non-rational behavior has been interpreted as resulting from confusion, kindness or fairness. For example, Andreoni (1995) developed a method to distinguish between confusion and kindness, and concluded that a relatively large part of positive contributions is interpreted as kindness. On the other hand, there are three fundamental criticisms of voluntary contribution mechanism experiments. First, most experiments to date have used a linear utility function where the marginal return of a public good out of one <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> of a private good is less than one. Therefore, no contribution is the best strategy. Since the solution is a corner solution, the experimental results were biased in favor of contribution. In order to answer this criticism, Saijo and Nakamura (1995) conducted experiments where the marginal return of a public good is greater than one (high marginal return). That is, all contribution is the dominant strategy. They compared the results to experiments where the marginal benefit of a public good is less than one (low marginal return) and found that the deviation from the dominant strategy in the case of high marginal return is larger than {{that in the case of}} low marginal return. They also found subjects who did not contribute cared about their relative ranking as well as monetary reward. In the case of high marginal return, if they cared about relative ranking among subjects, they would contribute nothing out of their initial holdings, but if they cared about the monetary reward, they would contribute everything. They termed this ambivalence the spite dilemma...|$|E

40|$|I study a sequential-move {{public goods}} game {{based on the}} notion that {{leadership}} comes with an obligation; conscientious leadership.

In a social optimization problem, the sum of individual weighted utilities is maximized over all feasible allocations that satisfy certain constraints. In this paper, we provide a mechanism that determines the set of proper individual weights {{to be applied to}} social optimization problems. To do this, we first define for every set of individual weights and for every social welfare function the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> every individual to the total welfare through the individual’s initial endowments. We then provide an axiomatic approach to the notion <b>of</b> the per <b>unit</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> every good and every individual. We then define a set of individual weights to be proper iff the weighted utilities of every individual from this allocation are proportional to the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> the individual to the total welfare as defined by this set of weights. It is shown that every contribution mechanism that satisfies these four axioms is uniquely determined by a non negative measure on the unit interval. The selection <b>of</b> a specific <b>contribution</b> mechanism (or equivalently the selection of a specific nonnegative measure on the unit interval) determines for a given economy and a given set of weights a proper constrained efficient allocation and a proper set of weights. Finally, we provide several numerical examples that illustrate our methodology.
