5000|$|Organic <b>UV</b> <b>Absorbers</b> {{are added}} to an inert, {{inorganic}} silica-based coating to yield a UV absorbing layer {{on one side of}} the glass. Organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> are capable of blocking almost 100% of UV radiation between 300 nm to 380 nm, but in an industrial environment it is difficult to make a sharp UV cut-off without affecting the visible spectrum, therefore <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> tend to also increase the absorption of the visible light.

40|$|CETEA- ITAL Abstract: The use of {{transparent}} packages {{has great}} marketing appeal since they allow consumers {{to actually see}} the product they wish to buy. However, the light that passes through the packaging material may catalyze oxidation reactions in photosensitive products and reduce their shelf life. The use of <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> in packages for personal care products is an increasing tendency in the market due to growing consumer preference for more natural, non-additive products. <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> prevent photo-degradation of the product {{as a result of}} the UV light barrier properties of the packaging, which protect the product against UV rays in the wavelength range of 200 - 380 nm. Although a number of studies indicate the need for the use of <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers,</b> they do not mention any technical reference data that could be used as quality parameters for packaging systems. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> as light barriers in plastic packages of personal care products in order to generate technical data required to establish specifications for these packaging systems...|$|R

50|$|Ensulizole (INN; {{also known}} as phenylbenzimidazole {{sulfonic}} acid) is a common sunscreen agent. In 1999, the United States Food and Drug Administration regulated that the name ensulizole be used on sunscreen labels in the United States. Ensulizole is primarily a UVB protecting agent providing only minimal UVA protection. The scope of UVB is 290 to 340 nanometers whereas the UVA range is 320 to 400 nanometers. For better UVA protection, it must be paired with avobenzone, titanium dioxide, or zinc oxide; outside of the United States {{it can also be}} paired with a <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> of the Tinosorb or Mexoryl types. Because ensulizole is water-soluble, it has the characteristic of feeling lighter on skin. As such, it is often used in sunscreen lotions or moisturizers whose aesthetic goal is a non-greasy finish. The free acid is poorly soluble in water, so it is only used as its soluble salts.|$|E

40|$|Matrix-assisted laser desorption/{{ionization}} (MALDI) {{has been}} widely used as a soft ionization technique and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) {{has been used to}} characterize polymeric materials. 1 - 5 MALDI is achieved in two steps. 6 - 9 In the first step, a mixture solution of an analyte and a matrix is spotted on the sample plate, and is dried before analysis. A solid solution deposit of analyte-doped matrix crystals is obtained, and the analyte molecules are completely isolated from each other by embedding throughout the matrix. The second step involves ablation of the solid solution by pulse laser. The pulse laser irradiation induces rapid heating to cause sublimation of the matrix crystals and ionization can occur during this process. Selection of the matrix in MALDI-MS absolutely affect the MALDI process. 1, 2 o-Hydroxyphenyl benzotriazole and hydroxyphenyl tri-azine derivatives are commonly used as <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers.</b> They absorb destructive UV radiation and dissipate the energy in the form of heat. 9 - 15 In general, the <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> absorb <b>UV</b> wavelength between 295 and 400 nm, so they can potential-ly play a role as a matrix in MALDI analysis. 16, 17 In this study, the <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> were employed as the matrix to analyze polystyrene (PS) using MALDI-MS.

40|$|The {{effect of}} some natural <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> on the photostabilization of spiroketal enol ethers (en-yn-dicycloethers) present in German Chamomille {{extracts}} pre-coated on glass plates (solid phase) was examined.

Using first-order kinetic equation, the dissipation half-life values (DT 50) for the degradation of the en-yn-dicycloethers under UV-sun radiation were obtained. The {{results showed that the}} addition of cumaric acid and caffeic acid provided moderate degree of photostabilization of the en-yn-dicycloethers and that addition of ferulic acid provided the best photostabilization among the <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> studied.

30|$|The {{photodegradation}} {{of biological}} materials {{is a great}} challenge to overcome for outdoor application of biomass products. In this study, an organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> coating that consist of a UV-curing paint, ethyl acetate, anhydrous alcohol, and BTZ- 1 was prepared, and the behaviour of this coating applied on OBS (sample D) when exposed to UV radiation was investigated. The colour characterization has demonstrated {{the efficiency of the}} organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> coating in promoting the stability of L* and ∆E*. The results of glossiness showed that the organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> coating exhibited a high gloss retention during weathering treatment. A positive correlation between CAs and SFE stabilities of samples and the application amount of the organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> (BTZ- 1) was noticed. The chemical structure of the coating after the addition of the organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> became more stable during exposure. The slight colour change, high gloss retention, slight CAs/SFE changes, and high functional group stability illustrate that the rate of degradation is much lower for sample D with the applied coat d than that for the control sample (A and B). In conclusion, the addition of the organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> improved the exterior durability of OBS. The coating d is considered to be the best UV shielding layer in this study and is effective in protecting OBS and reducing the surface photodegradation of the substrate and the coating.|$|E

30|$|Figure 5 {{shows the}} allure of the melting process of bulk lipid matrix (physical mixture of CP and GS), free lipid {{nanoparticles}} and lipid nanoparticles loaded with <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers.</b> From DSC curves {{it is observed that}} the crystallinity was different in the bulk lipid mixture, free-SLN and loaded-SLN, due to the presence of surfactants and molecular <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> in their compositions. The lipid mixture exhibits a broad melting range, whilst the lipid nanoparticles have a narrow peak at 50.2 °C (for empty SLN), 49.5 °C (for OCT-OMC - SLN) and 51.4 °C (for OCT-BEMT - SLN), respectively. The narrow of melting range in the case of SLNs is a proof of surfactants presence inside the lipid network that confers a more ordered arrangement. Moreover, by comparing the free SLN with SLN loaded with OCT-OMC and OCT-BEMT, it may be observed that the incorporation of <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> inside the solid lipid matrix has led to a decrease of crystallin arrangement, pointed out by the decrease of endothermal peak intensity.|$|R
30|$|The {{photostability}} of developed cosmetic formulations {{based on}} sunscreen-SLNs has been evaluated {{by exposure to}} a photochemical UV irradiation at a low energy.

The incorporation of two sunscreen couples into SLN leads to a further advantage - penetration of <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> into the skin is thereby reduced, resulting in {{a positive effect on}} the toxicological potential of the <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers.</b> Thus, it is possible to obtain a good photoprotection effect, an improved photostability and a lower allergenic potential using these sunscreen couples, thus demonstrating that UV absorbers-SLNs are promising carrier systems for cosmetic formulations.|$|R
40|$|Despite several {{excellent}} properties including low shrinkage, good chemical resistance, curable at {{low temperatures}} {{and the absence}} of byproducts or volatiles, epoxy resins are susceptible to ultra violet (UV) damage and their durability is reduced substantially when exposed to outdoor environments. To overcome this drawback, UV absorbers have been usually used to decrease the rate of UV degradation. In this present study, the effects of UV light on the chemical, mechanical and physical properties of cured epoxy structure, as well as the effect of an organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber,</b> Tinuvin 1130, on the epoxy properties were investigated.

The effect of Tinuvin 1130 on the surface morphology of the epoxy systems was also investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. Additionally, the glass transition temperatures (Tg) before and during UV radiation were measured. After an 800 h UV radiation, mechanical test results revealed that the lack of the <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> can lead to a ~ 30 % reduction in tensile strength. However, in the presence of Tinuvin 1130, the tensile strength was reduced only by ~ 11 %.
