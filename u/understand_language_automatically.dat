50|$|Paul Broca and Carl Wernicke {{were two}} {{physicians}} of the 1800s whose patients were {{evidence of the}} double dissociation between generating language (speech) and understanding language. Broca's patients could no longer speak but could <b>understand</b> <b>language</b> (non-fluent aphasia) while Wernicke's patients could no longer <b>understand</b> <b>language</b> but could produce jumbled speech (fluent aphasia). Post-mortems revealed lesions in separate {{areas of the brain}} in each case (now referred to as Broca's area and Wernicke's area respectively). Although the neurophysiology of language is now known to be more complicated than described by Broca or Wernicke, this classic double dissociation acted to begin modern neuropsychological investigation of language.|$|R

Another example being students being unable to explain in simply easy to <b>understand</b> <b>language</b> how to describe the speed at which objects fall.

40|$|Abstract. The {{availability}} of a C implementation of the Document Object Model (DOM) offers the interesting opportunity of generating bindings for different programming <b>languages</b> <b>automatically.</b> Because of the DOM bias towards Java-like languages, a C implementation that fakes objects, inheritance, polymorphism, exceptions and uses reference-counting introduces {{a gap between the}} API specification and its actual implementation that the bindings should try to close. In this paper we overview the generative approach in this particular context and apply it for the generation of C++ and OCaml bindings. ...|$|R
