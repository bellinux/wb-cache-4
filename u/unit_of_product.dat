25|$|The largest {{departure}} made by Galactic Civilizations II {{from other}} 4X games is its economic system, {{which is very}} different from the systems used in most strategy games. Typically, 4X strategy games receive money based on a tax rate or based on the income of specific tiles in use by a city or planet. Civilization IV uses this system, and most other 4X strategy games use a variant of it. These incomes are increased by economic structures and sometimes by population, and the profit made off this economic income is used to pay maintenance fees and rush-build units. Galactic Civilizations II adds another layer of complexity by requiring that the income of an empire is used to pay for all forms of production. In order to produce one <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>product,</b> be it research or manufacturing, the player must pay credits (usually in denominations of a Billion Credits, or BC). It is therefore critical that the player balances the economic income of their empire with their industrial output, and not just with the maintenance of their empire. If the player does not have the economy required to support an industrial planet, then they will have to spend at a deficit, and if the player does not correct their economy, they will eventually go broke. This stands in stark contrast to the Civilization series, where industrial output has nothing to do with the player's economic income.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{modified}} S-curve membership function methodology {{is used in}} a real life industrial problem <b>of</b> mix <b>product</b> selection. This problem occurs in production planning management where by a decision maker {{plays an important role}} in making decision in a fuzzy environment. As an analyst, we try to find a good enough solution for the decision maker to make a final decision. An industrial application of FLP through the S-curve membership function has been investigated using a set of real life data collected from a Chocolate Manufacturing Company. The problem <b>of</b> fuzzy <b>product</b> mix selection has been defined. The objective of this paper is to find an optimal <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> with higher level of satisfaction with vagueness as a key factor. This problem has been considered because all the coefficient such as technical and resource variables are uncertain. This is considered as one of sufficiently large problem involving 29 constraints and 8 variables. Since there are several decisions that were to be taken, a table for optimal <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> respect to vagueness and degree of satisfaction has been defined to identify the solution with higher level <b>of</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> and with a higher degree of satisfaction. It is to be noted that higher <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> need not lead to higher degree <b>of</b> satisfaction. Optimal <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> and satisfactory level have been computed using FLP approach. The fuzzy outcome shows that higher <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> need not lead to higher degree of satisfaction. The findings of this work indicates that the optimal decision is depend on vagueness factor in the fuzzy system <b>of</b> mix <b>product</b> selection problem.

3000|$|The {{decisions}} {{and the corresponding}} results for the distribution problem (upper level), and the production problem (lower level) are shown in Table  9 changing from iteration 1 to iteration 10 for the first product (K =  1) and the first period (T =  1). The best satisfactory solution is determined at iteration 10. In Table  9, Y [...] j [...] indicates whether distributor j is opened, N [...] ij [...] is the total number <b>of</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> that the open distributor j dispatches to customer zone i; I [...] j [...] and B [...] i, respectively, are the level of inventory open distributor j and backorder customer zone i. These are all decision variables for the upper level. Take row 10 as an example; in the U [...] jm [...] column, the rows of the matrix represent the distribution centers, and the columns represent the plants. Similarly, in the N [...] ij [...] column, the rows are the customer and the columns are the distribution centers. So, the best satisfactory cost is 102, 900 units for the upper level. On the lower level, the production problem is shown, where G [...] m [...] k [...] shows whether product k is manufactured at plant m, U [...] jm [...] shows the total number <b>of</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> shipped from plant m to the open distributor j, QP [...] m [...] k [...] shows the total number <b>of</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> k produced in plant m and IP [...] m [...] k [...] is the total number <b>of</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> k held at plant m.

Examples of variable costs are raw materials, direct labor (if such costs vary with sales levels), and sales commissions.

50|$|The {{paradigm}} aim is {{to achieve}} single-piece flow where a single discrete <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> flows from process to process. In effect, the batch quantity is one. If there is no change in part or product model, then this objective needs to be balanced against the additional handling time, and the work-centres that perform the process will typically have to be arranged {{in close proximity to}} one another in a flow-line.
