Mrs. Van Brugh has thought proper to place you on a pedestal that levels you, socially, with respectable Christians. In so doing, I consider that she has insulted respectable Christians.

2500|$|Through sensory {{stimulation}} retailers {{can engage}} maximum emotional impact between a brand and its consumers by relating to both profiles; the goal and experience. Purchasing {{behavior can be}} influenced through the physical evidence detected by the senses of touch, smell, sight, taste and sound. Supermarkets offer taste testers to heighten the sensory experience of brands. Coffee shops allow the aroma of coffee to waft into streets so that passers-by can appreciate the smell and perhaps be lured inside. Clothing garments are placed at arms' reach, allowing customers to feel the different textures of clothing. [...] Retailers <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> customers interact with products or handle the merchandise, {{they are more likely}} to make a purchase.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2017, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare {{unveiled}} resource material {{relating to}} health {{issues to be}} used as a part of a nationwide adolescent peer-education plan called Saathiya. Among other subjects, the material discusses relationships and consent. The material states, [...] "Yes, adolescents frequently fall in love. They can feel attraction for a friend or any individual of the same or opposite sex. It is normal to have special feelings for someone. It is important for adolescents to understand that such relationships are based on mutual consent, trust, transparency and respect. It is alright to talk about such feelings to the person for whom you have them but always in a respectful manner. ...

5000|$|It is {{essential}} to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the concept [...] "transverse" [...] is not reciprocal. Each participant <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the light reaches them transversely as {{measured in terms of}} that person's rest frame, the other had emitted the light afterward as measured in the other person's rest frame. In addition, each participant measures the other's frequency as reduced ("time dilation"). These effects combined make the observations fully reciprocal, thus obeying the principle of relativity.|$|R
60|$|It may {{easily be}} <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Mrs. Charleworth became a patroness of the Liberty Girls' Shop, and {{was known to}} have made sundry {{purchases}} there, the high standing of that unique enterprise was assured.

30|$|From the RMPA {{procedure}} described previously, {{it should}} be <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> determining the consecutive decision-making stages for SCI and LGD trigger generation, there is enough information to allow the MS to calculate the expected handover signaling latency.

60|$|Now {{it must be}} <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> General Washington {{heard the}} news of the fall of Ticonderoga, he sent General Benedict Arnold with as many troops as could be gathered, to {{strengthen}} the northern army.

She told us so frankly {{and let it}} be <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I {{was talking}} to her and her {{heliotrope}} shawl was allowed to slip under one arm {{it was a sign}} that we were not to be interrupted. I was as vain of her favour as any lovelorn suitor whose lady had honoured him, not knowing, as I came to know later, the reason for it.|$|R
50|$|Lyle saw the {{connection}} between concepts developed by Bob Rodale of the Rodale Institute for regenerative agriculture {{and the opportunity to}} develop regenerative systems for all other aspects of the world. While regenerative agriculture focused solely on agriculture, Lyle expanded its concepts and use to all systems. With regenerative agriculture, the concepts are very straight forward and simple but Lyle <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> developing for other types of systems, more complicated ideas such as entropy and emergy must be taken into consideration.|$|R

40|$|Linearity, {{sometimes}} {{jointly with}} constant variance, is routinely assumed {{in the context}} of sufficient dimension reduction. It is well <b>understood</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> these conditions do not hold, blindly using them may lead to inconsistency in estimating the central subspace and the central mean subspace. Surprisingly, we discover that even if these conditions do hold, using them will bring 15 efficiency loss. This paradoxical phenomenon is illustrated through sliced inverse regression and principal Hessian directions. The efficiency loss also applies to other dimension reduction procedures. We explain this empirical discovery by theoretical investigation...|$|R

2500|$|The Vishwa Hindu Parishad's {{vice-president}} Om Prakash Singhal said, [...] "This {{is a right}} decision, {{we welcome}} it. Homosexuality is against Indian culture, against nature and against science. We are regressing, going back to when we were almost like animals. The SC had protected our culture." [...] Singhal further dismissed HIV/AIDS concerns within the LGBT community saying, [...] "It is <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you try to suppress one anomaly, {{there will be a}} break-out of a few more." [...] This, however, is in stark disagreement with many Hindu teachings because Hinduism does not view homosexuality as a religious sin.|$|R
5000|$|As Frelinghuysen is less {{conservative}} than {{many members of}} the Republican caucus, he was elevated to the Appropriations Committee chairship only based on his assurance to the conservatives that {{he would be willing to}} set aside his personal views to implement party policy.

He {{mentioned that he}} is the active leader in Telangana and also said that his ‘Boss’ assigns crucial matters only to him. He assured that everything will be taken care by Boss. And mentioned that he reported about money matter. He stressed that everything is done based on Boss instruction. Authorities arrested Revanth Reddy and later the video was telecasted in media. Everyone <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> a Party MLA refers someone as ‘Boss’ repeatedly, it may be none otherthan the Party President Chandrababu Naidu.|$|R
