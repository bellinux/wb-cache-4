50|$|CNC <b>indexing</b> <b>heads</b> may be {{controlled}} {{in two different}} modes. The most basic method of operation uses simple control functions built into the dividing head. It {{does not require a}} CNC machine. The operator enters the desired angle into a control box attached to the <b>indexing</b> <b>head</b> and it automatically rotates to the desired position and locks into place for machining. Changing angles is as simple as typing a new angle value onto the control pad. This is simpler than setting up a manual <b>indexing</b> <b>head</b> because {{there is no need to}} interchange indexing plates or to calculate which hole positions to use. It is also faster for repetitive operations because the work can be indexed by simply pressing a button, eliminating the need to count rotations of the hand crank or specific hole positions on the indexing plate. A CNC dividing head may be used in this manner on either manual or CNC machinery.|$|R

50|$|An <b>indexing</b> <b>head,</b> {{also known}} as a {{dividing}} head or spiral head, is a specialized tool that allows a workpiece to be circularly indexed; that is, easily and precisely rotated to preset angles or circular divisions. <b>Indexing</b> <b>heads</b> are usually used on the tables of milling machines, but may be used on many other machine tools including drill presses, grinders, and boring machines. Common jobs for a dividing head include machining the flutes of a milling cutter, cutting the teeth of a gear, milling curved slots, or drilling a bolt hole circle around the circumference of a part.|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{implementation}} of a highly efficient <b>universal</b> <b>index</b> of textual documents. Universal stands {{for an opportunity to}} configure structures of index records and methods of the index data processing (without recompiling an application). Furthermore, it means that the index library can be used even for other purposes, for example to implement a thesaurus, to represent bibliographic relationships or even for generic representation of a specific class of functions in other areas than documentographic systems. The index is implemented using the dynamic inverted file which can be efficiently updated without need of the data structure rebuilding. Specific issue is on-line index compression and failure recovery via the transactional log. It is shown that the amortized complexity of the data structure is linear. This fact is afterwards experimentally verified. Other experiments address the compression methods and the impact of the data structure parameters on its efficiency. The diploma thesis contains the implementation of the <b>universal</b> <b>index</b> in C/C++. It has been tested in the Linux and Windows XP environments...|$|R

50|$|Non-IT-assisted {{physical}} guidance was {{the first}} means of providing indexing capability, via purely mechanical means. It allowed the Industrial Revolution to progress into the Machine Age.

Some archetypal examples, developed to perfection before the advent of the IT era, are , the turrets on manual turret lathes, <b>indexing</b> <b>heads</b> for manual milling machines, rotary tables, and various indexing fixtures and blocks that are simpler and less expensive than <b>indexing</b> <b>heads,</b> and serve quite well for most indexing needs in small shops. Although <b>indexing</b> <b>heads</b> of the pre-CNC era are now mostly obsolete in commercial manufacturing, the principle of purely mechanical indexing is still a vital part of current technology, in concert with IT, even as it has been extended to newer uses, such as the indexing of CNC milling machine toolholders or of indexable cutter inserts, whose precisely controlled size and shape allows them to be rotated or replaced quickly and easily without changing overall tool geometry.|$|R

40|$|The time {{course of}} the center of {{pressure}} (CoP) during human quiet standing, corresponding to body sway, is a stochastic process, influenced by a variety of features of the underlying neuro-musculo-skeletal system, such as postural stability and flexibility. Due to complexity of the process, sway patterns have been characterized in an empirical way by a number of indices, such as sway size and mean sway velocity. Here, we describe a statistical approach with the aim of estimating "universal" indices, namely parameters that are independent of individual body characteristics and thus are not "hidden" by the presence of individual, daily, and circadian variations of sway; in this manner it is possible to characterize the common aspects of sway dynamics across healthy young adults, in the assumption that they might reflect underlying neural control during quiet standing. Such <b>universal</b> <b>indices</b> are identified by analyzing intra and inter-subject variability of various indices, after sorting out individual-specific indices that contribute to individual discriminations. It is shown that the <b>universal</b> <b>indices</b> characterize mainly slow components of sway, such as scaling exponents of power-law behavior at a low-frequency regime. On the other hand, most of the individual-specific indices contributing to the individual discriminations exhibit significant correlation with body parameters, and they can be associated with fast oscillatory components of sway. These results are consistent with a mechanistic hypothesis claiming that the slow and the fast components of sway are associated, respectively, with neural control and biomechanics, supporting our assumption that the universal characteristics of postural sway might represent neural control strategies during quiet standing...|$|R
