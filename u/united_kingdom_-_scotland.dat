40|$|It is {{important}} therefore to train staff in risk assessment and risk management. The manual that follows {{and the work}} done along with it is one such training. We are grateful to colleagues in New Zealand, particularly for the work they have done {{in this area of}} mental health service development as we borrowed from them and were encouraged. The work from the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> <b>-</b> England and <b>Scotland</b> has also encouraged us in our endeavour. In all of this work {{there is a need for}} the patient to be fully involved and the role played by carers and staff respected. Culture and background are vital aspects of our identities that must be taken into account. The emphasis of our New Zealand colleagues on Maori culture reminds us that our Aboriginal patients have important cultural beliefs which need to be integrated in any plan. Patients from a culturally and linguistically diverse background equally need extra attention. Such matters are part of our identity, sense of self so often challenged by mental illness institution services. Leadership in all these matters is crucial and this training is to give practitioners the skills required for the task...|$|R
