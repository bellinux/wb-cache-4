The Congress tightly controlled the epic public displays of grief over a two-week period—the funeral, mortuary rituals and distribution of the martyr's ashes—as millions participated and hundreds of millions watched. The goal was to assert the power of the government, legitimise the Congress party's control and suppress all religious para-military groups. Nehru and Patel suppressed the RSS, the Muslim National Guards, and the Khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests. Gandhi's death and funeral linked the distant state with the Indian people and made more <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to suppress religious parties during the transition to independence for the Indian people.|$|E
25|$|Britain {{realised}} {{the value}} of troops from the Australian colonies. The climates and geography of Southern Africa and Australia were quite similar, and most Australian soldiers, {{the vast majority of}} whom were trained as mounted rifles, were well-suited to operating in such terrain. Britain was also quick to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for further horsemen, as the Boers operated {{with a high degree of}} mobility across the Southern African grasslands, often referred to romantically as 'the vastness of the veldt'. At that time, most British troops were recruited from within urban environments, and although their ability as soldiers was not questioned, they did not have the natural horsemanship and bush craft of the Australians, many of whom came from rural backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|In Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World (1978), Girard {{develops}} {{the implications of}} this discovery. The victimary process is the missing link between the animal world and the human world, the principle that explains the humanization of primates. It allows us to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for sacrificial victims, which in turn explains the hunt which is primitively ritual, and the domestication of animals as a fortuitous result of the acclimatization of a reserve of victims, or agriculture. It shows that at the beginning of all culture is archaic religion, which Durkheim had sensed. The elaboration of the rites and taboos by proto-human or human groups would take infinitely varied forms while obeying a rigorous practical sense that we can detect: the prevention of the return of the mimetic crisis. So we can find in archaic religion the origin of all political or cultural institutions.|$|E

25|$|Bad weather {{operations}} completely overtaxed fighter {{units and}} inflicted high losses which caused {{a drop in}} morale and confidence in the High Command. The OKL itself did not <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for economical employment of strength {{with respect to the}} RLV. All raids had to be met at full strength, rapidly wearing down the defenders. Contributing to the wearing down of fighter units was the over-long use of the heavy fighter, the Bf 110 and Me 410, insisted by Hitler and Göring. Göring permitted no realistic reflection on the loss of air superiority, but squandered time and energy in the disparagement of the Jagdwaffe. Both Zerstörer types had to be withdrawn from daylight combat by the spring of 1944 due to losses. The USAAF's new commander of the Eighth Air Force, Major General Jimmy Doolittle, changed fighter tactics as 1944 began, devastated the Luftwaffes day fighter defences {{for the rest of the}} war over Germany and achieved near-complete air supremacy for the Allies by the time Operation Overlord was launched in early June 1944.|$|E

500|$|As of 2010, the Conservancy was {{undertaking}} several {{programs to}} help breeders and the public <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for {{and the way to}} preserve heritage breeds. As the number of expert livestock breeders continues to dwindle, the Master Breeders' Apprentice Program aims to supplement their number by educating competent and interested members of the public. Through the Breed Rescue and Conservation Acquisition Program, the organization works with breeders and breed registries to begin and sustain conservation programs for rare livestock breeds. The Southeastern Livestock Breed Initiative aims to expand and reintroduce rare breeds from the American southeast, combining traditional breeds with low-impact farming (agriculture that has a lesser impact on the environment than high-intensity commercial farming) to assist in restarting the small, niche market farming that once existed in the area. [...] In 2014, the Conservancy published the book An Introduction to Heritage Breeds describing conserving and care of animals under the purview of the organization, detailing each breed's specific needs and characteristics.|$|E

500|$|The medal's {{order of}} {{precedence}} was criticized by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The commander of this organization, John Hamilton, explained, [...] "It {{is very important to}} properly recognize all who faithfully serve and excel, but this new medal – no matter how well intended – could quickly deteriorate into a morale issue. Medals that can only be earned in direct combat must mean more than medals awarded in the rear." [...] The Military Order of the Purple Heart joined in condemnation, stating [...] "To rank what is basically an award for meritorious service higher than any award for heroism is degrading and insulting to every American Combat Soldier, Airman, Sailor or Marine who risks his or her life and endures the daily rigors of combat in a hostile environment. The Military Order of the Purple Heart strongly urges the newly appointed Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to either reconsider the precedence of the Distinguished Warfare Medal or develop another way to recognize the achievements of those whose indirect actions contribute greatly to the accomplishment of the mission without diminishing the sacrifice of life and limb by those who confront the enemy firsthand on the battlefield." [...] The Association of the United States Navy also expressed criticism of the medal's placement, stating [...] "While AUSN supports the medal itself, as well as the achievements and importance of the cyber warfare community, the concern lies with the ranking of the medal." [...] Doug Sterner, military medals expert and curator of the Military Times Hall of Valor, expressed confusion, saying, [...] "I <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to recognize the guys at the console who are doing some pretty important things. But to see it ranking above the Bronze Star (with) V?" [...] Nick McDowell, a member of the Orders and Medals Society of America said that an alternative to adding a new medal could be adding a new ribbon device to an existing medal, and said that [...] "The problem is that we're adding another non-valor personal decoration into a system that is already crowded with non-valor personal decorations." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Britain the {{botanist}} George Henslow, {{the son of}} [...] Darwin's mentor John Stevens Henslow, was {{an important}} advocate of neo-Lamarckism. He studied how environmental stress affected the development of plants, and he wrote that the variations induced by such environmental factors could largely explain evolution. The historian of science Peter J. Bowler writes that, as was typical of many 19th century Lamarckians, Henslow {{did not appear to}} <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to demonstrate that such environmentally induced variations would be inherited by descendants that developed {{in the absence of the}} environmental factors that produced them, but merely assumed that they would be.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{criticism}} of Girard's work comes from intellectuals who claim that his comparison of Judeo-Christian texts vis-à-vis other religions leaves something to be desired. There are also those who find {{the interpretation of the}} Christ event—as a purely human event, having nothing to do with redemption from sin—an unconvincing one, given what the Gospels themselves say. Yet, Roger Scruton notes, Girard's account has a divine Jesus: [...] "that Jesus was the first scapegoat to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for his death and to forgive those who inflicted it… [...] Girard argues, Jesus gave the best evidence… of his divine nature." ...|$|E
2500|$|The lords' {{failure to}} <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for an {{impartial}} and functioning judiciary is {{echoed in the}} rebellion; [...] "The virulent ambition and hostility to law that characterised the barons equally characterise the workmen," [...] suggesting {{there is no difference}} between the old order and the new. This is evident in Cade's speech after ordering the execution of Lord Saye; [...] "The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head on his shoulders unless he pay me tribute. There shall not a maid be married but she shall pay to me her maidenhead ere they have it. Men shall hold of me in capite. And we charge and command that their wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell" [...] (4.7.112–117). In this proposed new world order, Cade envisions establishing an autocracy where all will pay fealty to him, and where his laws, which he can make arbitrarily, stand for everyone. As such, in this political system, as in the old, law and justice seem to have little relevance.|$|E

2500|$|Necker's {{dismissal}} on 11 July 1789, {{provoked by}} his {{decision not to}} attend Louis XVI's speech to the Estates-General, enraged the people of France and sparked rumors that the king meant to attack Paris or arrest the deputies. These fears and the foreign and French troops - called by the King - surrounding Paris and the National Assembly [...] provoked the storming of the Bastille on 14 July. [...] The king recalled Necker on 19 July. He was received with joy in every city he traversed, but in Paris he again proved to be no statesman. Believing that he could save France alone, he refused to act with the Comte de Mirabeau or Marquis de Lafayette, the most prominent statesmen at the time. He caused the king's acceptance of the suspensive veto, by which he sacrificed his chief prerogative in September, and destroyed all chance of a strong executive by contriving the decree of 7 November, by which the ministry might not be chosen from the assembly. Financially, he proved equally incapable for a time of crisis and could not <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> of such extreme measures as the establishment of assignats {{in order to keep}} the country quiet. Necker stayed in office until 1790, but his efforts to keep the financial situation afloat were ineffective. His popularity vanished and he resigned with a damaged reputation.|$|E

6000|$|Then in my Utopia, {{for every}} medical {{man who was}} mainly {{occupied}} in practice, I would have another who was mainly occupied in or about research. People hear so much about modern research {{that they do not}} realise how entirely inadequate it is in amount and equipment. Our general public is still too stupid to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> and value of sustained investigations in any branch of knowledge at all. In spite of all the lessons of the last century, it still fails to realise how discovery and invention enrich the community and how paying an investment is the public employment of clever people to think and experiment for the benefit of all. It still expects to get a Newton or a Joule for £800 a year, and requires him to conduct his researches in the margin of time left over when he has got through his annual eighty or ninety lectures. It imagines discoveries are a sort of inspiration that comes when professors are running to catch trains. It seems incapable of imagining how enormous are the untried possibilities of research. Of course, if you will only pay a handful of men salaries at which the cook of any large London hotel would turn up his nose, you cannot expect to have the master minds of the world at your service; and save for a few independent or devoted men, therefore, it is not reasonable to suppose that such a poor little dribble of medical research as is now going on {{is in the hands of}} persons of much more than average mental equipment.

6000|$|... 158. The public, of course, {{cannot be}} {{convinced}} of this unity {{and stability of}} principle until clear assertion of it is made to them by painters whom they respect; and the painters whom they respect are generally too modest, and sometimes too proud, to make it. I believe the chief reason for their not having yet declared at least the fundamental laws of labour as connected with art-study {{is a kind of}} feeling on their part that [...] "cela va sans dire." [...] Every great painter knows so well the necessity of hard and systematized work, in order to attain even the lower degrees of skill, that he naturally supposes if people use no diligence in drawing, they do not care to acquire the power of it, and that the toil involved in wholesome study being greater than the mass of people have ever given, is also greater than they would ever be willing to give. Feeling, also, as any real painter feels, that his own excellence is a gift, no less than the reward of toil, perhaps slightly disliking to confess the labour it has cost him to perfect it, and wholly despairing of doing any good by the confession, he contemptuously leaves the drawing-master to do the best he can in his twelve lessons, and with courteous unkindness permits the young women of England to remain under the impression that they can learn to draw with less pains than they can learn to dance. I have had practical experience enough, however, to convince me that this treatment of the amateur student is unjust. Young girls will work with steadiest perseverance when once they <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> of labour, and are convinced that drawing is a kind of language which may for ordinary purposes be learned as easily as French or German; this language, also, having its grammar and its pronunciation, to be conquered or acquired only by persistence in irksome exercise--an error in a form being as entirely and simply an error as a mistake in a tense, and an ill-drawn line as reprehensible as a vulgar accent.|$|E
