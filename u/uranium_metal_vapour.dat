40|$|Thesis (MSc (Physics)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Third {{harmonic}} generation (THG) in a <b>metal</b> <b>vapour</b> is a nonlinear optical interaction that facilitates {{the generation of}} light in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The requirement of the <b>metal</b> <b>vapour</b> medium is that it has a suitably large third order nonlinear susceptibility. The third order susceptibility is further enhanced by a two photon resonance. Zinc and magnesium vapours are such nonlinear media. The THG process can be phase matched by mixing the <b>metal</b> <b>vapour</b> with a noble gas in a speci c pressure ratio. The <b>metal</b> <b>vapour</b> noble gas mixture needs to be homogeneous and its temperature needs to be constant to within less than a degree Celsius over a path length of 7 cm. These requirements are satis ed by a crossed heat pipe oven. The heat pipe oven makes use of a dynamic liquid-vapour phase equilibrium in sodium in order to maintain a constant temperature of around 800 degrees Celsius, thus facilitating the generation of a stable homogeneous medium of <b>metal</b> <b>vapour</b> and noble gas {{that can be used for}} e cient generation of VUV radiation.
