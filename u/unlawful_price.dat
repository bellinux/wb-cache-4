50|$|Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773 (1975) the Virginia State Bar, {{which was}} {{delegated}} power to set price schedules for lawyers fees, was an <b>unlawful</b> <b>price</b> fixing. It {{was no longer}} exempt from the Sherman Act, and constituted a per se infringement.|$|E
5000|$|In 1976, a dozen Texaco {{retailers}} in Spokane, Washington who sued Texaco and won damages of $449,000, {{which were}} trebled under antitrust law. Texaco and other oil companies {{had made a}} practice of selling gasoline at one price to retailers, and a lower price to wholesalers. When some wholesalers went into the retail business, they obtained gasoline for their retail stations at the wholesaler discount, resulting in <b>unlawful</b> <b>price</b> discrimination. The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed this decision in 1990.|$|E
40|$|Dominant {{firms can}} use various {{strategies}} to eliminate or deter competition, including <b>unlawful</b> <b>price</b> cuts or “predatory pricing”. That strategy involves {{a willingness to}} absorb losses {{in the near term}} that are rational only because they lead to greater profit in the longer term, after competitors have been disciplined or eliminated. Despite differences in statutes across jurisdictions, the roundtable discussion held in October 2004 in the Competition Committee quickly revealed a virtually unanimous view that the purpose of competition laws is to protect and promote competition, not competitors. With respect to methods for detecting predatory prices, including price-cost tests, there was a greater diversity of views because different cost measures are appropriate in different situations. There was broad agreement among Members that investigations should include an examination of whether an alleged predator would likely be able to recoup its predatory losses, with a negative finding indicative of a low probability of harm to competition. ...|$|E

5000|$|Professor Fellmeth {{left the}} Nader {{organization}} after the Congress Project in 1973. That same year he began {{service as a}} public prosecutor in San Diego County, enforcing state law as a deputy district attorney until 1981, specializing in white collar crime. In 1974, he started the nation’s first dedicated local prosecution unit enforcing antitrust and unfair competition statutes. [...] For {{the next seven years}} he filed related cases. For the last two of those years, from 1979 to 1981, he was cross commissioned also as an Assistant United States Attorney - a status that allows the filing of criminal or civil cases in either the state or federal jurisdiction. Over this period, he prosecuted 22 antitrust and unfair competition cases. Those reported (with published appellate decisions) included People v. Mobile Magic and People v. National Association of Realtors, with a resulting judgment of liability for per se <b>unlawful</b> tie-in and <b>price</b> fixing offenses against the national, state and local realtor trade associations.|$|R
40|$|A {{price squeeze}} {{occurs when a}} {{vertically}} integrated firm 2 ̆ 2 squeezes 2 ̆ 7 a rival 2 ̆ 7 s margins between a high wholesale price for an essential input sold to the rival, and a low output price to consumers for whom the two firms compete. Price squeezes have been a recognized but controversial antitrust violation for two-thirds of a century. We examine the law and economics of the price squeeze, beginning with Judge Hand 2 ̆ 7 s famous discussion in the Alcoa case in 1945. While Alcoa has been widely portrayed as creating a 2 ̆ 2 fairness 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 fair profit 2 ̆ 2 test for <b>unlawful</b> <b>price</b> squeezes, Judge Hand actually adopted a cost-based test, although a somewhat different one than most courts and scholars would adopt today. We conclude that strictly cost-based predatory pricing tests {{such as the one}} the Supreme Court developed in its 1993 Brooke Group decision are not appropriate to the concerns being raised in a price squeeze. We also consider several efficiency explanations, the importance of joint costs, situations in which the dominant firm uses a squeeze to appropriate the fixed cost portion of the rival 2 ̆ 7 s investment, as well as those where the shared input is a fixed rather than variable cost for the rival. Ultimately, we find little room for antitrust liability except in one circumstance: where a squeeze is used to restrain the rival 2 ̆ 7 s vertical integration into the monopolized market...|$|E
40|$|In its Twombly {{decision}} the Supreme Court {{held that}} an antitrust complaint failed because its allegations {{did not include}} enough “factual matter” to justify proceeding to discovery. Two years later the Court extended this new pleading standard to federal complaints generally. Twombly’s broad language {{has led to a}} broad rewriting of federal pleading doctrine. Naked market division conspiracies such as the one pled in Twombly must be kept secret because antitrust enforcers will prosecute them when they are detected. This inherent secrecy, which the Supreme Court did not discuss, has dire consequences for pleading if too much factual specificity is required. Indeed, it can close the door in cases where the conspiracy is reasonably suspected but supporting evidence has not already been uncovered. In the paradigm cartel case the defendants meet secretly in a hotel room and plot prices or output. But antitrust agreements can be proven by other evidence, including evidence of interdependence, parallel behavior, and actions contrary to independent self-interest. By indicating that the complaint failed because it did not state “which of their employees” may have conspired and that there was some “when” or “where” that the agreement took place, the Court was apparently requiring the plaintiff to plead something in its complaint that existing law would not require it to show in order to avoid summary judgment or a JML at trial. Or to say it differently, the Court was changing conspiracy doctrine {{at the same time that}} it was changing pleading doctrine 6. The most salient fact about Twombly is that, although it was a proof-of-agreement case, the claim was of geographic market division rather than parallel pricing. For all of its lengthy discussion about the facts essential to a good complaint, the Supreme Court paid little attention to the difference between price fixing and market division. While parallel pricing typically is interdependent conduct, parallel failures to enter one another’s markets typically are not. As a result, methods of indirect proof that might work in a case alleging <b>unlawful</b> <b>price</b> fixing are unlikely to work in one alleging unlawful market division. Twombly clearly reached the correct conclusion, but it could have done less damage to the values of notice pleading stated in the Federal Rules had it focused more narrowly on the mechanisms by which anticompetitive agreements are proven. Pleading reform requires, not an increase in “factual matter,” but rather a closer correlation between the legal elements that must be proven and the allegations in a complaint...|$|E
40|$|Both {{economics}} and antitrust policy have traditionally distinguished “production” from “distribution. ” The former {{is concerned with}} how products are designed and built, the latter with how they are placed {{into the hands of}} consumers. Nothing {{in the language of the}} antitrust laws suggests much concern with production as such. Although courts do not view it that way, even per se <b>unlawful</b> naked <b>price</b> fixing among rivals is a restraint on distribution rather than production. Naked price fixing assumes a product that has already been designed and built, and the important cartel decision is what should be each firm’s output, or the price charged to buyers. At the same time, however, many price agreements among rivals are in fact a part of design or production rather than distribution. Many of the difficulties that antitrust law has had with vertical restraints arose because antitrust courts mistakenly viewed a practice as part of distribution when it was really part of design or production. Agreements that seem nominally to be about distribution or price are in fact mechanisms by which firms share design and production activities. For example, tying arrangements are not simply ways of pricing finished goods. Rather, as the long history of tying-like practices in patent law illustrates, most tying is the consequence of a design or production choice or else a mechanism for sharing entrepreneurial risk. Particularly misunderstood are variable proportion, or metering, ties. Ignoring incentive effects, when the seller has a monopoly in the tying product and the tied product is perfectly competitive, such ties may reduce short run consumer welfare from the single monopoly price, at least if they also reduce output of the durable good. However, that result is trivial across the range of litigated variable proportion tying cases. The sellers in these cases are virtually never monopolists or even close. When metering ties are imposed by nonmonopolists the welfare effects are unambiguously positive. An antitrust policy driven by concerns for consumer welfare should favor design and production initiatives but disfavor restraints on pricing. Indeed, it is more important for antitrust policy to get the innovation question right than to be right on price, because innovation has the potential to affect economic development much more dramatically, and in both directions. That is, just as innovation benefits the economy by a greater amount than price competition under constant technology, so too a restraint on innovation can do greater harm. By focusing so much on price, antitrust policy has often missed the point of some arrangements, particularly those that involve new technologies or innovations in business organization. In the process, it has confused innovation with monopoly. For example, antitrust’s long war with tying arrangements occurred because litigants and courts were obsessed with pricing and either never queried or else did not appreciate how tying relates to innovation and production. By their nature, innovations upset a market’s equilibrium, producing temporarily higher returns. As a result, a common feature of innovation is short-run prices that are above cost and welfare reducing to the myopic eye. These are essential features of innovation-intensive markets, however, and in such cases the social cost of false condemnation is high...|$|R
