5|$|The AACS Licensing Authority (LA) assigns {{a series}} of 253 unique {{cryptographic}} keys to device manufacturers. When an AACS protected disc is manufactured, {{a series of}} up to 64 keys called title keys are generated and the video content on the disc is encrypted using these keys. The title keys are stored on the disc and themselves encrypted with another key called the volume <b>unique</b> <b>key.</b> The volume <b>unique</b> <b>key</b> for any disc can be calculated by all authorized devices using another key called a processing key, which is derived from a media key block stored on each disc. Authorized devices use {{one or more of}} the manufacturer's assigned device keys to decrypt the media key block, yielding a processing key and enabling further decryption of the volume and title keys, and finally the content.|$|E
5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a <b>unique</b> <b>key,</b> but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as C‑ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, {{but they do not}} have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative files also allow for both sequential and random access.|$|E
5|$|If {{a device}} {{key is to}} be revoked, the media key blocks on all discs {{manufactured}} after the time of revocation are encrypted {{in a way which}} does not enable the revoked device to obtain a valid processing key. Users trying to view new content on a revoked player would be forced to upgrade their player software to a more secure version, thereby limiting the scope of the compromise each time an exploit is discovered. While a compromised device or processing key could be used to decrypt a large number of discs, BackupHDDVD does not use these keys because they can be revoked by AACS LA. Because the AACS revocation system works by preventing a given device or player from calculating a valid volume <b>unique</b> <b>key,</b> BackupHDDVD circumvents the system entirely by relying on volume or title keys leaked from authorized players. With these keys BackupHDDVD is not subject to device revocation and is able to decrypt the content directly, bypassing the key exchange and verification process.|$|E

25|$|The interrelationship of {{the keys}} most {{commonly}} used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the circle of fifths. <b>Unique</b> <b>key</b> signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as {{the doctrine of the}} affections, were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others. Indian classical music theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and notably, does not employ equal temperament.|$|E
25|$|Because DVD-Video's content-scrambling system (CSS) {{was quickly}} broken, DVD-Audio's {{developers}} sought a better method of blocking unauthorized duplications. They developed CPPM, {{which uses a}} media key block (MKB) to authenticate DVD-Audio players. In order to decrypt the audio, players must obtain a media key from the MKB, which also is encrypted. The player must use its own <b>unique</b> <b>key</b> to decrypt the MKB. If a DVD-Audio player's decryption key is compromised, that key can be rendered useless for decrypting future DVD-Audio discs. DVD-Audio discs can also utilize digital watermarking technology developed by the Verance Corporation, typically embedded into the audio once every thirty seconds. If a DVD-Audio player encounters a watermark on a disc without a valid MKB, it will halt playback. The 4C Entity also developed a similar specification, Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM), which is used on Secure Digital cards.|$|E

30|$|Relational {{databases}} {{have their}} focus on rows in which they store the instances or the records and return rows or instances of an entity against a data retrieval query. Such rows posses <b>unique</b> <b>keys</b> against each instance for locating the information.

40|$|Chemical {{structures}} are usually {{stored in a}} database using <b>unique</b> <b>keys</b> as an identifier. However, many of the present chemical database systems use keys that may not allow the chemical structure to be derived. This is an aspect of usefulness of the <b>unique</b> <b>keys.</b> In contrast, some keys that are useful may not be unique enough. In a recent publication, the SMILES algorithm is suggested to be producing non-unique identifiers (Robert Grossman et al, 2005). In this paper, we debate the usefulness and uniqueness of SMILES algorithm to a certain extent, show how the SMILES algorithm fails to produce unique identifiers and show how we can adapt from the SMILES algorithm to produce identifiers that are unique and useful. We also developed an algorithm named Graph Linear Representer (GLR) that constructs a unique identifier for chemical structures. The algorithm was tested against 10, 000 random structures obtained from {{the national cancer institute}} database. In this paper, we also show that the new algorithm produces <b>unique</b> <b>keys</b> that are useful, unique and flexible. Subject Descriptor...|$|R
