25|$|This poetic diary is in {{the form}} known as haibun, a {{combination}} of prose and haiku. It contains many references to Confucius, Saigyō, Du Fu, ancient Chinese poetry, and even The Tale of the Heike. It manages to strike a delicate balance between all the elements to produce a powerful account. It is primarily a travel account, and Bashō vividly relates the unique poetic essence of each stop in his travels. Stops on his journey include the Tokugawa shrine at Nikkō, the Shirakawa barrier, the islands of Matsushima, Hiraizumi, Sakata, Kisakata, and Etchū. He and Sora parted at Yamanaka, but at Ōgaki he briefly met <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of his other disciples before departing again to the Ise Shrine and closing the account.|$|E

500|$|Going Commando was {{approved}} for development {{five months before}} the first game's release, after highly positive reviews from the original's playtesters. In August 2002, Insomniac Games started designing the visual concepts for Going Commando, while still fixing bugs in the original game. Brian Hastings, Insomniac's Vice President of Programming, said in a 2003 interview that {{the first step in}} the game's design was to [...] "try to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> 'Big Ideas'. These are the things we think will really grab people's attention and give the game that Wow-Factor. In the case of Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando the big ideas were RPG elements (like weapon upgrades and health upgrades), spherical planets and space combat." [...] Hastings said that the inspiration for the game's spherical worlds came in part from the cover of the 1943 novel The Little Prince. Designing the spherical worlds required changing about 50,000 lines of the game's code, to account for the different handling of gravity. Development took a total of ten months, during which time Insomniac's design team doubled from 40 to 80 members.|$|E

The song interpolates a song called [...] "I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair", written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez and originally performed by Inner Life in 1979. Adams and Gonzalez are credited as songwriters as a result. In August 2012, Cox revealed that he, Carey and Dupri had started working on Carey's then untitled fourteenth studio album, later revealed to be Me. I Am Mariah...

500|$|By 18 August, Eisenhower {{had ordered}} that Patton's Seventh Army be broken <b>up,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of its units {{remaining}} garrisoned in Sicily. The {{majority of its}} combat forces would {{be transferred to the}} Fifth United States Army under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark. This had already been planned by Eisenhower, who had previously told Patton that his Seventh Army would not be part of the upcoming Allied invasion of Italy, scheduled for September. On 20 August, Patton received a cable from Eisenhower regarding the arrival of Lucas at Palermo. Eisenhower told Patton it was [...] "highly important" [...] that he personally meet with Lucas as soon as possible, as Lucas would be carrying an important message. Before Lucas arrived, Blesse arrived from Algiers to look into the health of the troops in Sicily. He was also ordered by Eisenhower to deliver a secret letter to Patton and investigate its allegations. In the letter, Eisenhower told Patton he had been informed of the slapping incidents. He said he would not be opening a formal investigation into the matter, but his criticism of Patton was sharp.|$|E
500|$|Following a 10-year {{break from}} music, Jackson signed {{with her brother}} Michael's record label, MJJ Music, in 1997. From the label, Yours Faithfully was {{released}} on March 31, 1998. The album featured a remixed version of Jackson's successful [...] "Centipede". Initially, the singer had not wanted to feature the track, believing that {{it was part of}} the past. After thinking about it for a while, Jackson felt that the inclusion of the remix which features a rap by son Austin would be a good way to return to the music scene. In addition, her two other children, Stacee and Yashi, contributed backing vocals for the album. Other tracks from the album included [...] "Fly Away", which was written and produced by brother Michael, who also served as co-executive producer for Yours Faithfully. Fellow producers included Keith Thomas and Eliot Kennedy. The album also featured a duet with Men of Vizion's Spanky Williams on The Spinners' [...] "I Don't Want to Lose You", which Jet described as being a [...] "sizzling" [...] rendition. Yours Faithfullys title track was released as a single and peaked at number 76 on the R chart. Vibe magazine's Quohnos Mitchell expressed disappointment in the album, labelling its content a [...] "mix of dated R grooves dressed <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> cleverly placed samples".|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Carina Chocano praised The O.C. {{for being}} different, {{claiming}} {{that it was}} [...] "refreshingly free of both [...] Spelling-style camp and the twee earnestness that has characterized more recent teen dramas". Robert Bianco of USA Today drew comparisons with the successful Fox show Beverly Hills, 90210, saying that [...] "The O.C. is better-written and better-acted by a cast that just might be, incredibly enough, even better-looking". He praised the cast's skill and attractiveness {{as well as the}} show's ability to [...] "come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> smart deviations from the genre norm". Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized the plot for being too predictable, but praised Adam Brody as Seth, stating that [...] "he talks too much and too fast, he mumbles, and he projects zero physical confidence. In short, his character is adorable." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that [...] " [...] McKenzie, at times, is prone to overdramatizing scenes", and considered the young characters [...] "so detestable and yet bland" [...] that it made the show [...] "almost painful" [...] to watch. He nevertheless affirmed that the show had [...] "positive attributes" [...] that made it enjoyable. Andrew Grossman of The Boston Globe commented that [...] "Brody is instantly likable as Seth" [...] and that Barton [...] "does a nice job with Marissa's torn-between-two-worlds angst", but stated that Ryan [...] "doesn't seem to have many clear personality traits". Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle called the episode [...] "superb" [...] and described McKenzie as [...] "essentially playing James Dean". He compared the actor to Russell Crowe and noted that McKenzie [...] "pull the whole thing off with aplomb".|$|E
500|$|Gen. Grey {{had been}} {{instructed}} not to attack until {{he heard the}} sound of firing from Howe's column, but after several hours, he became impatient and decided to proceed on his own. [...] He formed his column into three divisions, with the Queen's Rangers were on the left, the Jägers {{on each side of the}} road, and the light infantry of the Guards on the right, and headed in the direction of Tyson's Tavern on Limekiln Road. [...] As Grey advanced toward the American center, his troops took fire from American militia on Edge Hill. The militia were quickly routed, with between twenty and thirty killed, and fifteen of them taken as prisoners. Gens. John Cadwalader and Joseph Reed, out reconnoitering on horse near Twickenham, the country estate of Thomas Wharton Jr., attempted to rally the Potter's fleeing Pennsylvania militia. Lieut. Col. Sherman, the officer in charge of the 2nd Connecticut Continentals, resented Reed's assumption of command, and later complained to Washington that it put [...] "...Officers and Men into such confusion that it rendered it impossible to keep that regularity so necessary when going into Action." [...] The British soon had them surrounded and outnumbered, and the Pennsylvania militia again panicked and fled. [...] The 2nd Connecticut Continentals made a stand, firing between two and five rounds per man; Sherman only gave the order to retreat when the Jägers were within 15–20 yards of his position. [...] At some point, Cadwalader and Reed became separated from the militia, and Reed's horse was shot out from under him. A body of Hessians charged at the two officers with bayonets, but Capt. McLane rode <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> dragoons and ordered a charge that scattered the Hessians. McLane then took the two officers to safety.|$|E

2500|$|The National Science Foundation funded {{researcher}} David Berube {{to study}} the field of nanotechnology. His findings are published in the monograph Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz.

[...] Further applications which require actual manipulation or arrangement of nanoscale components await further research. Though technologies branded with the term 'nano' are sometimes little related to and fall far short of the most ambitious and transformative technological goals of the sort in molecular manufacturing proposals, the term still connotes such ideas. According to Berube, there may be a danger that a [...] "nano bubble" [...] will form, or is forming already, from {{the use of the term}} by scientists and entrepreneurs to garner funding, regardless of interest in the transformative possibilities of more ambitious and far-sighted work.|$|E
