40|$|Plasma <b>upflows</b> {{have been}} {{detected}} in active regions using Doppler velocity maps. The origin and nature of these <b>upflows</b> is not well known with many of their characteristics determined from the examination of single events. In particular, some studies suggest these <b>upflows</b> occur along open field lines and, hence, are linked to sources of the solar wind. To investigate the relationship these <b>upflows</b> may have with the solar wind, and to probe what may be driving them, this paper considers seven active regions observed on the solar disc using the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer aboard Hinode between August 2011 and September 2012. Plasma <b>upflows</b> are observed in all these active regions. The locations of these <b>upflows</b> are compared to the global potential magnetic field extrapolated from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager daily synoptic magnetogram taken {{on the day the}} <b>upflows</b> were observed. The structure of the magnetic field is determined by constructing its magnetic skeleton in order to help identify open-field regions and also sites where magnetic reconnection at global features is likely to occur. As a further comparison, measurements of the temperature, density and composition of the plasma are taken from regions with active-region <b>upflows.</b> In most cases the locations of the <b>upflows</b> in the active regions do not correspond to areas of open field, as predicted by a global coronal potential-field model, and therefore these <b>upflows</b> are not always sources of the slow solar wind. The locations of the <b>upflows</b> are, in general, intersected by separatrix surfaces associated with null points located high in the corona; these could be important sites of reconnection with global consequences.

Stand-alone paper mills using imported pulp may only require simple primary treatment, such as sedimentation or dissolved air flotation. Increased BOD or COD loadings, as well as organic pollutants, may require biological treatment such as activated sludge or <b>upflow</b> anaerobic sludge blanket reactors.

25|$|In {{the case}} of an <b>upflow</b> {{anaerobic}} sludge blanket digestion (UASB), hydraulic residence times can be as short as 1 hour to 1 day, and solid retention times can be up to 90 days. In this manner, a UASB system is able to separate solids and hydraulic retention times {{with the use of a}} sludge blanket. Continuous digesters have mechanical or hydraulic devices, depending on the level of solids in the material, to mix the contents, enabling the bacteria and the food to be in contact. They also allow excess material to be continuously extracted to maintain a reasonably constant volume within the digestion tanks.|$|E

The event we reported suggests that the parallel acceleration of ion conics is rather independent of the anisotropic heating and is most probably caused by a parallel electric field.

60|$|He reverts again {{presently}} to {{the topic}} of this sponge-caught lunar atmosphere. I am told by astronomers and physicists that all he tells is in absolute accordance with what was already known of the moon's condition. Had earthly astronomers had the courage and imagination to push home a bold induction, says Mr. Wendigee, they might have foretold almost everything that Cavor has to say of the general structure of the moon. They know now pretty certainly that moon and earth are not so much satellite and primary as smaller and greater sisters, made out of one mass, and consequently made of the same material. And since the density of the moon is only three-fifths that of the earth, there can be nothing for it but that she is hollowed out by a great system of caverns. There was no necessity, said Sir Jabez Flap, F.R.S., that most entertaining exponent of the facetious side of the stars, that we should ever have gone to the moon to find out such easy inferences, and points the pun with an allusion to Gruyere, but he certainly might have announced his knowledge of the hollowness of the moon before. And if the moon is hollow, then the apparent absence of air and water is, of course, quite easily explained. The sea lies within {{at the bottom of the}} caverns, and the air travels through the great sponge of galleries, in accordance with simple physical laws. The caverns of the moon, on the whole, are very windy places. As the sunlight comes round the moon the air in the outer galleries on that side is heated, its pressure increases, some flows out on the exterior and mingles with the evaporating air of the craters (where the plants remove its carbonic acid), while the greater portion flows round through the galleries to replace the shrinking air of the cooling side that the sunlight has left. There is, therefore, a constant eastward breeze in the air of the outer galleries, and an <b>upflow</b> during the lunar day up the shafts, complicated, of course, very greatly by the varying shape of the galleries, and the ingenious contrivances of the Selenite mind....|$|E
40|$|Minimal {{observational}} {{evidence exists}} for fast transition region (TR) <b>upflows</b> {{in the presence}} of cool loops. Observations of such occurrences challenge notions of standard solar atmospheric heating models, as well as their description of bright TR emission. Using the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode, we observe fast <b>upflows</b> (v_Î» < - 10 km s^- 1) over multiple TR temperatures (5. 8 < T < 6. 0) at the footpoint sites of a cool loop (T < 6. 0). Prior to cool loop energizing, asymmetric flows of + 5 km s^- 1 and - 60 km s^- 1 are observed at footpoint sites. These flows speeds and patterns occur simultaneously with both magnetic flux cancellation (at site of <b>upflows</b> only) derived from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDOs) Helioseismic Magnetic Imager's (HMI) line-of-sight magnetogram images, and a 30 % mass in-flux at coronal heights. The incurred non-equilibrium structure of the cool loop leads to a catastrophic cooling event, with subsequent plasma evaporation indicating the TR as the heating site. From the magnetic flux evolution we conclude that magnetic reconnection between the footpoint and background field are responsible for observed fast TR plasma <b>upflows.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the Hanle {{effect in}} solar {{molecular}} lines {{allows us to}} obtain empirical information on hidden, mixed-polarity magnetic fields at subresolution scales in the (granular) <b>upflowing</b> regions of the `quiet' solar photosphere. Here we report that collisions {{seem to be very}} efficient in depolarizing the rotational levels of MgH lines. This has the interesting consequence that in the <b>upflowing</b> regions of the quiet solar photosphere the strength of the hidden magnetic field cannot be sensibly larger than 10 G, assuming the simplest case of a single valued microturbulent field that fills the entire <b>upflowing</b> photospheric volume. Alternatively, an equally good theoretical fit to the observed scattering polarization amplitudes can be achieved by assuming that the rate of depolarizing collisions is an order of magnitude smaller than in the previous collisionally dominated case, but then the required strength of the hidden field in the <b>upflowing</b> regions turns out to be unrealistically high. These constraints reinforce our previously obtained conclusion that there is a vast amount of hidden magnetic energy and unsigned magnetic flux localized in the (intergranular) downflowing regions of the quiet solar photosphere.
