Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods for inference in the array normal model {{have appeared in the}} literature, but there have not been any results concerning the optimality properties of such estimators. In this article, we obtain results for the array normal model that are analogous to some classical results concerning covariance estimation for the multivariate normal model. We show that under a lower triangular product group, a <b>uniformly</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>risk</b> equivariant estimator (UMREE) can be obtained via a generalized Bayes procedure.

For the goal of selecting a nonempty subset of {Π 1, [...] .,Πk}, containing the best population (one associated with max (θ 1, [...] ., θk)), we consider the decision rule which selects Πi {{if and only if}} Xi ≥ c max (X 1, [...] ., Xk), i = 1, [...] . k, where 0 < c ≤ 1 is chosen so that the probability of including the best population in the selected subset is at least P ∗(1 /k ≤ P ∗ < 1), a pre-assigned level.

40|$|Several {{methods are}} {{available}} in literature for estimating the variance components in mixed effects models. In this thesis we consider the general mixed effects model without making any distributional assumptions. The quadratic unbiased estimators are considered for estimating the variance components. The <b>uniformly</b> <b>minimum</b> variance quadratic unbiased estimation (UMVQUE) of variance components is investigated for the data obtained from both balanced and unbalanced designs. In spite of its attractive properties, the UMVQUE {{may not always be}} possible. When the UMVQUE is not possible, we propose two alternative methods for estimating the variance components. We first introduce a method of near <b>uniformly</b> <b>minimum</b> variance quadratic unbiased estimation (NUMVQUE) for an unbalanced incomplete block design. When the UMVQUE of variance components is not possible for a design with replicated blocks but it is possible with a single replication of blocks, we propose another method of average <b>uniformly</b> <b>minimum</b> variance quadratic unbiased estimation (AUMVQUE). The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REMLE) are likelihood based procedures and therefore require the distributional assumptions to estimate the variance components.

This MMSE estimator however is not computable in practice if [sigma]/[mu] is unknown.
