40|$|When air-dry <b>urediospores</b> of {{the wheat}} stem rust, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, {{are exposed to}} {{temperatures}} below freezing, their germinability is markedly reduced, even after prolonged thawing at room temperature.

Immersion freezing was used to determine freezing onset temperatures and the abundance of ice nuclei in suspensions of washed spores. Microbiological analyses of spores and subsequent tests of the ice nucleation activity of the bacteria associated with spores were deployed to quantify the contribution of bacteria to the ice nucleation activity of the spores. All samples of spores were ice nucleation active having freezing onset temperatures as warm as − 4 °C.

However, the function of calcineurin genes in Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) is unclear. We identified and characterized the calcineurin genes PsCNA 1 and PsCNB 1 in Pst. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that PsCNA 1 and PsCNB 1 form a calcium/calmodulin regulated protein phosphatase belonging to the calcineurin heterodimers composed of subunits A and B. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that both PsCNA 1 and PsCNB 1 expression reached their maximum in the stage of haustorium formation, which is one day after inoculation. Using barely stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) as a transient expression vector in wheat, the expression of PsCNA 1 and PsCNB 1 in Pst was suppressed, leading to slower extension of fungal hyphae and reduced production of <b>urediospores.</b> The immune-suppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK 506 markedly reduced the germination rates of <b>urediospores,</b> and when germination did occur, more than two germtubes were produced.

40|$|Phakopsora pachyrhizi SYD. & P. SYD, {{the causal}} agent of Asian soybean rust {{is one of}} the {{economically}} most important pathogens on soybean. Plants resistant against all isolates of the fungus are not yet available and it is foreseeable that resistances against fungicides in use will occur. Therefore, this study aimed at gaining {{a deeper understanding of the}} infection mechanism with the goal of identifying novel and innovative strategies to combat the disease. Methods applied to reach that goal ranged from histology and microscopy to molecular biology. The first critical stage during the invasion of host plants by P. pachyrhizi is the penetration of the host tissue. In this study, it could be shown that the unusual direct penetration of P. pachyrhizi urediospores is mediated via a high turgor pressure in the hyaline, non-melanized appressoria. To achieve this, Mach-Zehnder transmission- light interferometry was applied. On basis of the “mean specific optical path difference” the concentration of substances in the cytosol of P. pachyrhizi and M. oryzae appressoria were compared. GC-TOF/MS measurements allowed the identification of appressorial cytosolic compounds, which were needed to determine the refractive index increments. Using this parameter, the osmotic potential of the cytosolic content of P. pachyrhizi and M. oryzae appressoria could be calculated to 3. 9 MPa and 6. 75 MPa, respectively. Incipient cytorrhysis was used as a method for independent verification of these results. Experiments on inert PTFE membranes showed that the pressure in the soybean rust appressoria alone is sufficient for penetration of membranes of thicknesses in the range of the soybean leaf cuticle (130 nm). Studies on the genome and transcriptome of P. pachyrhizi were conducted to answer the question which additional factors enable the penetration of the host plant and the establishment of the biotrophic interaction. Partial sequencing followed by K-mer analysis allowed the estimation of the size of the soybean rust genome to around 1 Gb and suggested a high degree of heterozygosity. Based on these results an Illumina-RNA-seq approach was followed. Early infection stages including appressoria and isolated fungal haustoria from late infection stages were sampled and RNA was extracted and sequenced. The de novo assembled transcriptome was comprised of 29. 362 sequences with a N 50 -value of 2868 bp which could be narrowed down to 20. 612 sequences via in silico translation and redundancy filtering. The differential expression analysis between appressorial- and haustorial stages revealed distinct groups of effectors and cell wall degrading enzymes. The de novo assembled transcriptome was further used for nano-LC-MS/MS based identification of proteins in the <b>urediospore</b> germination fluids. Among these proteins, those carrying a signal peptide were significantly enriched and cell wall degrading enzymes and effectors could be identified. Since stable deletion or silencing of genes is not yet possible in the obligate biotrophic fungus P. pachyrhizi, alternative methods for functional gene characterization were evaluated. Down-regulation of mRNA abundance via exogenous applied small interfering RNA (siRNA) or siRNA formed in planta were tested. Remarkably, it was possible to decrease germ tube length by transcriptional silencing of a cell wall biosynthesis associated beta- 1, 3 -glucan-synthase gene Agrobacterium-mediated expression of a beta- 1, 3 -glucan-synthase - and a sterol- 14 -alpha-demethylase -hairpin construct in planta led to decreased fungal growth after inoculation. The novel insights into the infection mechanism obtained in this study and the de novo sequenced and assembled transcriptome are a basis for further studies aiming at minimizing P. pachyrhizi’s detrimental impact on soybean production...|$|E

5000|$|Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli is an obligate parasite, and as {{with most}} other rust fungi diseases, spruce broom rust {{requires}} two different host plants {{to carry out its}} life cycle and is therefore referred to as heteroecious. [...] The primary or aecial host of the rust is spruce (Picea spp.), and the secondary or telia host of the rust is bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi). The alternative bearberry host is necessary for aeciospore germination, and is therefore essential for the rust’s lifecycle. Spruce broom rust is a macrocyclic rust, meaning that the fungus produces more spore types in addition to teliospores and basidiospores. [...] In midsummer, aecia appear on the epidermis of spruce needles as orange pustules. [...] Eventually, these aecia rupture and release millions of microscopic, orange aeciospores, which are carried to bearberry by wind. [...] These aeciospores are capable of infecting bearberry leaves; however, they are not able to reinfect spruce. [...] Assuming favorable, moist environmental conditions upon the secondary host, these aeciospores germinate and the bearberry’s leaves develop dark purple-brown blotches. [...] Come springtime, these blotches develop waxy telia {{on the bottom of the}} leaves and pierce the bearberry’s epidermis. [...] Teliospores are produced by these telia and germinate to become basidiospores, which infect the primary spruce host when wind carries them to young, developing needles. [...] This infection in the spruce is systemic [...] and perennial, allowing the fungus to live in the brooms from year to year. [...] Upon infection of the developing spruce needles, basidiospores produce haploid mycelia that form spermatia. These spermatia do not infect either host; rather, they serve as male gametes and fertilize receptive hyphae, forming dikaryotic mycelium and in turn dikaryotic aeciospores. [...] From here the disease cycle repeats, and symptoms similar to last season arise on the spruce by midsummer.A feature unique to the Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli disease cycle is the fact that the fungus does not produce <b>urediospores,</b> and thus spruce broom rust is not a truly macrocyclic disease. The lack of <b>urediospores</b> prevents reinfection of the primary host within the same year.|$|R
5000|$|Rusts (Pucciniales, {{previously}} {{known as}} Uredinales) at their greatest complexity, produce five {{different types of}} spores on two different host plants in two unrelated host families. Such rusts are heteroecious (requiring two hosts) and macrocyclic (producing all five spores types). Wheat stem rust is an example. By convention, the stages and spore states are numbered by Roman numerals. Typically, basidiospores infect host one, {{also known as the}} alternate or sexual host, the mycelium forms pycnidia, which are miniature, flask-shaped, hollow, submicroscopic bodies embedded in host tissue (such as a leaf). This stage, numbered [...] "0", produces single-celled spores that ooze out in a sweet liquid and that act as nonmotile spermatia, and also protruding receptive hyphae. Insects and probably other vectors such as rain carry the spermatia from spermagonium to spermagonium, cross inoculating the mating types. Neither thallus is male or female. Once crossed, the dikaryons are established and a second spore stage is formed, numbered [...] "I" [...] and called aecia, which form dikaryotic aeciospores in dry chains in inverted cup-shaped bodies embedded in host tissue. These aeciospores then infect the second host, known as the primary or asexual host (in macrocyclic rusts). On the primary host a repeating spore stage is formed, numbered [...] "II", the <b>urediospores</b> in dry pustules called uredinia. <b>Urediospores</b> are dikaryotic and can infect the same host that produced them. They repeatedly infect this host over the growing season. At the end of the season, a fourth spore type, the teliospore, is formed. It is thicker-walled and serves to overwinter or to survive other harsh conditions. It does not continue the infection process, rather it remains dormant for a period and then germinates to form basidia (stage [...] "IV"), sometimes called a promycelium. In the Pucciniales, the basidia are cylindrical and become 3-septate after meiosis, with each of the 4 cells bearing one basidiospore each. The basidiospores disperse and start the infection process on host 1 again. Autoecious rusts complete their life-cycles on one host instead of two, and microcyclic rusts cut out one or more stages.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} the black spore phase. Near the {{beginning}} of autumn, production of rust-colored <b>urediospores</b> is replaced by the formation of black over-wintering spores.

The black-brown lesions are called telia and give a blackish hue {{to the top of}} the plants. The teliospores remain attached in the pustules on asparagus plant parts or plant debris for the remainder of the season and throughout winter.Around springtime when young asparagus shoots are emerging, the overwintering teliospores germinate on the old stems to produce sporidia. The sporidia (also called blasidiospores) infect nearby emerging shoots or spears. This infection results in pycnia, producing pyciniospores and repeating the disease cycle.|$|R

Orientated growth of the germ tubes seems to start only upon contact with the epidermal cell junctions. The lateral growing of the germ tube over the first epidermal cell junction that it meets is longer than the subsequent lateral growings. These lateral growings, especially the first one, may help the germ tube to grow along the transverse axis of the leaf. No evidence was found of attraction of the germ tube by stomata.

This fungus produces four out of five of the spores known to be produced by the class Urediniomycetes during its life cycle. (Teliospores, Basidiospores, Spermatia, and Aeciospores. The type of spore it does not produce is <b>Urediospores.)</b> Rust fungi have a complicated life-cycle with up to five types of spores (each borne on a different type of structure) in its life cycle and often an alternate host, and an [...] "alternate alternate host" [...] as well. Basidiomycetes that have all 5 spore stages and those with less are said to be [...] "macrocyclic" [...] or [...] "microcyclic" [...] respectively.|$|R
40|$|Rust is {{a serious}} disease of pea whose casual agent is not always understood. In this paper we studied {{reaction}} of pea accessions to seven rust species infecting closely related legumes, finding that indeed pea can be infected mainly by. Uromyces pisi, followed by. Uromyces viciae-fabae. Other rust species like. Uromyces striatus,. Uromyces ciceris-arietini,. Uromyces anthyllidis and. Uromyces vignae can also infect and reproduce on pea, although in a minor extent. All. U. pisi isolates tested were very virulent on pea accessions, but isolates UpPt- 03 and UpKeS- 05 (from Palmar de Troya, Spain and Kafr-El-Sheik, Egypt respectively) were significantly most infective. In addition to this we studied in detail the host range of. U. pisi by inoculating multiple accessions of various legumes with <b>urediospores</b> of seven isolates of. U. pisi from different geographical origins. Both experiments were performed under controlled conditions. Based on the evidence presented here the host range of. U. pisi is greater than previously recorded, including genotypes belonging to. Cicer arietinum,. Vicia articulada,. Vicia ervilia and.

40|$|Wheat leaf rust {{caused by}} Puccinia triticina is {{regularly}} observed in Belgian fields. This fungus produces wind-dispersed <b>urediospores</b> that infect host plants many kilometers from their source plant, but {{the origin of}} the primary inoculum and the factors involved in disease occurrence and severity are not well known. In order to better understand the epidemiology of the disease, the dispersion of P. triticina airborne inoculum and the relationship with disease incidence in fields were studied. A network of Burkard 7 -day spore-recording traps was set up in wheat fields in the Walloon region, in Belgium, to monitor the airborne inoculum. Total DNA from each fragment of spore trap tape, corresponding to 1 day of sampling, was extracted and the quantity of P. triticina on the tape fragments was assessed using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The disease incidence was recorded weekly in experimental fields from March 2012 onwards. Initial analysis revealed that the real-time PCR assay was highly specific and repeatable. The detection threshold was determined at 7 spores per m 3. This method (spore traps coupled with real-time PCR) allows airborne inoculum to be detected before the appearance of symptoms in fields and could be used in a model for predicting wheat leaf rust epidemics...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{was done to}} know the efficacy of black tea extract to control coffee leaf rust, the most important disease of Arabica coffee caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix B et Br. Black tea was extracted by boiling 50 g of tea in 500 ml of water until 50 ml of solution was left and used as spraying material after 10 time dilution. Influence of black tea extract to <b>urediospores</b> germination was done by spore germination technique. Field experiment was done at Pagilaran Tea Plantation with a susceptible Arabica coffee Kate 26 variety. Coffee plants was sprayed with diluted tea extract eight times with 10 days interval and 0, 3 % of triadimefon was used as standart fungicide. The result showed that black tea extract inhibited germination of urediospora and reduced germtube length up to 10 - 4 dilution. The extract of black tea could reduce disease intensity of coffee leaf rust in the field better than triadimefon. Ten days after first spraying, disease intensity was reduced but it increased after 5 times spraying. After 8 times spraying disease intensity on coffee tree sprayed with the black tea extract was lower than that sprayed with tradimefon. Key words: black tea, Hemileia vastatrix, triadimefo...|$|R
40|$|Effect of {{infestation}} of Verticillium lecanii on {{the severity}} of coffee leaf rust on plants and the incidence of its colony on coffee leaves.   V. lecanii often antagonizes H. vastatrix on lesions caused by the pathogen on coffee leaves in the field.   The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the efficacy of V. lecanii to control disease severity on coffee plants in a green house and to compare the incidence of V. lecanii colonies on coffee leaves naturally infested by V. lecanii in the field and that in the leaves with additional infestation in the laboratory.   For efficacy test and additional infestation in the laboratory, conidia were harvested from YMPD medium.   Suspension with 107 conidia ml- 1 was sprayed into coffee foliage until both surfaces of the leaves were saturated with the suspension.   After the leaves were air dried, they were sprayed with <b>urediospores</b> (104 ml- 1).   The results show that disease severity in plants treated with V. lecanii and control plants was not significantly different (P < 0. 05), except that obtained at the fourth week when disease severity on the treated plants was significantly lower that that in control plants.   The number of V. lecanii colonies on coffee leaves naturally infested with the biocontrol agent was not increased by additional infestation with V. lecanii conidia in the laboratory...|$|R
30|$|Ice-nucleating {{organisms are}} found in rain (Michaud et al. 2014; Hara et al. 2016; Failor et al. 2017). Some are {{especially}} effective at promoting freezing, for example, spores of certain rust fungi (specifically, asexual <b>urediospores)</b> capable of long distance atmospheric transport, nucleate ice at temperatures as warm as −[*] 4 degrees centigrade (°C) (Morris et al. 2013). We don’t know {{the degree to which}} these organisms influence cloud formation or precipitation but the relationships likely operate in both directions. Many particles are washed out of the air by rain, though the impact of droplets on surfaces can also yield increases (Joung et al. 2017). Indeed these combined effects are known to modify the composition of airborne bacteria, for example observations in Korea indicate that after rainfall the airborne abundance of some families such as Carnobacteriaceae and Clostridiales typically decreased while the non-spore forming Actinobacteria such as the Propionibacteriaceae increased (Jang et al. 2017). Increases in some particles also arise though biological responses. For example, observations near the coast of Southern Norway (Birkenes) indicate that atmospheric concentrations of ice-nucleating particles (active at −[*] 8  °C) increase after rain from May to mid- September but are supressed once snow lies across the landscape. Detection of the sugar alcohols arabitol and mannitol, suggest a fungal source for some of these ice promoting particles (Conen et al. 2017). Similar seasonal relationships between ice-nucleating particles and rain have been reported across Eastern Australia (Bigg and Miles 1964), the USA (forested areas of Colorado) (Prenni et al. 2013), Switzerland (Chaumont) and Russia (Novosibirsk, Siberia) (Conen et al. 2017). Laboratory observations have shown that ice nucleating particles are emitted from decaying leaves (Schnell and Vali 1972; Schnell and Vali 1973) leading to the proposal that the natural abundance of these particles is associated with the fungal activity that results from fallen leaves and sufficient moisture (Conen et al. 2017).|$|R

Prä-inokulativ wurden Blätter und Saatgut der Pflanzen mit den Testsubstanzen behandelt. Zur Testung gelangten Bakterien-Kulturfiltrat (KF), KF-Zenrifugationsüberstände, die vegetativen Zellen und Sporen der B. subtilis Stämme. Nach lokaler Applikation der KF-Überstände von B. subtilis auf die Wirtspflanzenblätter konnte eine erhebliche Breite antibiotischer (entwicklungshemmender) Wirkungen auf A. fabae und R. padi beobachtet werden. Eine Untersuchung der freien Aminosäuren im Phloemsaft von Vicia faba zeigte, daß sich nach Befall von Aphis fabae speziell bei den zuvor mit bakteriellem Kulturfiltrat und KF-Überstand behandelten Pflanzen im Vergleich zu der nur mit Wasser behandelten Kontrolle, die Konzentration von neun Aminosäuren änderte. In topical and {{systemic}} plant treatment, in three host–parasite systems, i. e. Vicia faba - Uromyces appendiculatus, Vicia faba - Aphis fabae and Triticum aestivum - Rhopalosiphum padi the culture filtrate and supernatant of Bacillus subtilis (FZB 24, FZB 37 and FZB 38 from FZB Biotechnik Berlin) {{was shown to}} inhibit the development of <b>urediospores</b> produced by Uromyces appendiculatus. The performance of Aphis fabae and Rhopalosiphum padi was evaluated using life table tests where the aphids'' development time (tD), pre-reproduction time (td), relative growth rate (RGR) and intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} (rm) were assessed. A wide range of antibiosis effects in Aphis fabae and Rhopalosiphum padi was observed when the supernatant of Bacillus subtilis was used as foliar topical treatment. The tested aphids presented longer development and pre-reproduction time; conversely a lower relative growth rate and intrinsic rate of natural increase was observed. The investigation of the free amino acids of the phloem sap of V. faba plants, showed the concentration of the amino acid serine remained unchanged in the supernatant induced plants in this study, which was interpreted as the major reason for the observed antibiosis effect on the tested aphids...|$|R
40|$|Among {{diseases}} that cause serious yield reduction on Populus deltoides is leaf rust caused by Melampsora medusae. The objectives {{of this project}} were to study the pathogenic variability of M. medusae, the genetic basis of inheritance of M. medusae resistance {{in a family of}} P. deltoides; and to identify molecular markers linked to a leaf-rust resistant locus. Three pathotypes of M. medusae were identified {{on the basis of their}} differential reaction to three Populus clones. Pathotypes D- 93, F- 93, and IL- 48 were compatible with clone 1 - 488 (P. X euramericana). F- 93 and IL 48 were also compatible with clone 57 - 276 (P. deltoides X P. trichocarpa), and IL- 48 is compatible with clone 7300501 (P. deltoides). No M. medusae isolates from central Iowa were compatible with clone 7302801 (P. deltoides). Pathotype D- 93 was the most abundant in the 1992 and 1993 growing seasons, but it has not been prevalent since 1995. In addition, <b>urediospores</b> of D- 93 were significantly smaller in size than the more virulent pathotypes. An intraspecific cross was made between a rust-resistant male clone and a susceptible female P. deltoides clone. The F 1 progenies (n = 207) segregated 1 : 1 for rust resistance to the 1995 [...] 97 rust population in Iowa indicating the role of a single locus. We named this locus Lrd 1. An isolate from an earlier 1992 [...] 93 Iowa rust population (D- 93) produced immune and hypersensitive resistant reactions, respectively, in the resistant male and susceptible female parent and their progenies indicating that rust resistance is pathotype specific. In addition, the progeny did not segregate to isolates of M. larici-populina, and an isolate of M. medusae (G 139 - 91) from the Pacific Northwest. This indicates that Lrd 1 is different from the previously described rust resistance loci. Bulked Segregant Analysis (BSA) identified two Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA markers that are closely linked to Lrd 1 (1. 7 and 7 cM). These markers will be instrumental in cloning gene(s) involved in rust resistance, and may prove useful for marker assisted selection of leaf-rust-resistant genotypes...|$|R
