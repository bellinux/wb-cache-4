In the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>any</b> use of lasers in a show or display requires pre-approval from the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health. This is required both for the laser equipment, and separately for the show itself (site, audience configuration, beam effects, etc.). As part of the CDRH's show approval ("variance") process, the CDRH will require a letter of non-objection from the FAA. Without this, the laser show cannot legally proceed.|$|E

25|$|We {{know from}} Plutarch that Xenocrates, {{if he did}} not explain the Platonic {{construction}} of the world-soul as Crantor after him did, nevertheless drew heavily on the Timaeus; and further that he was at the head of those who, regarding the universe as unoriginated and imperishable, looked upon the chronological succession in the Platonic theory as a form in which to denote the relations of conceptual succession. Plutarch unfortunately, does not give <b>us</b> <b>any</b> further details, and contented himself with describing the well-known assumption of Xenocrates, that the soul is a self-moving number. Probably we should connect with this the statement that Xenocrates called unity and duality (monas and duas) deities, and characterised the former as the first male existence, ruling in heaven, as father and Zeus, as uneven number and spirit; the latter as female, as the mother of the gods, and as the soul of the universe which reigns over the mutable world under heaven, or, as others have it, that he named the Zeus who ever remains like himself, governing in the sphere of the immutable, the highest; the one who rules over the mutable, sublunary world, the last, or outermost.|$|E
25|$|The Panarion furnishes very {{valuable}} {{information concerning the}} religious history of the fourth century, either because the author confines himself to transcribing documents preserved by him alone, or because he writes down his personal observations. With regard to Hieracas (Haer., lxvii), he makes known a curious Egyptian sect by whom asceticism and intellectual work were equally esteemed. In connection with the Meletians of Egypt (Haer., lxviii), he has preserved important fragments of contemporary Egyptian history of this movement. With regard to Arianism (Haer., lxix), if he gives an apocryphal letter of Constantine, he transcribes two letters of Arius. He {{is the only one}} to give <b>us</b> <b>any</b> information concerning the Gothic sect of the Audians (Haer., lxx), as well as the Arabian sect of the Collyridians. He has made use of the lost report of the discussion between Photinus (Haer., lxxi), and Basil of Ancyra. He has transcribed a very important letter from Bishop Marcellus of Ancyra (Haer., lxxii) to Pope Julius, and fragments of the treatise of Acacius of Caesarea against Marcellus. With regard to the Semiarians (Haer., lxxiii), he gives in the Acts of the Council of Ancyra (358) a letter from Basil of Ancyra and one from George of Laodicea, and the stenographic text of a singular sermon of Melitius {{at the time of his}} installation at Antioch. In the chapter dealing with the Anomeans (Haer., lxxvi) he has preserved a monograph of Aetius.|$|E

[...] During the first practice session on Friday, Mercedes tried out what was dubbed a [...] "S-duct", a vent to channel airflow through the nose of the car, a feature already seen at other cars {{over the course of the}} season.

500|$|Several titles were {{considered}} during production, including [...] "Shot Down in Flames" [...] and [...] "IV".

The album was called [...] "Made in the Dark" [...] because it was a title the band agreed on. Taylor considered the eponymous track to be one of his favourite songs, and thought it was nice to name the album after a thoughtful song, in contrast to Coming on Strong and The Warning, which he described as being [...] "big, slightly jokey, macho phrases".|$|E

[...] In addition, an explanation for Chobitss plot was given by Igarashi who stated: [...] "Back then, when our computer had problems all we would get were these inscrutable error messages. However, {{we had no idea}} what was wrong because it wouldn't tell <b>us</b> <b>any</b> more". Clamp also describes Chobits as a variation of the [...] "boy living with mysterious girl" [...] genre.

500|$|On 3 July 2012, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson {{confirmed}} that Pogba {{had left the}} club after not signing a new contract. Ferguson stated that Pogba had signed for Italian club Juventus [...] "a long time ago as far as we're aware." [...] Ferguson also accused Pogba of disrespecting Manchester United, saying, [...] "It is disappointing. I don't think he showed <b>us</b> <b>any</b> respect at all, to be honest. I'm quite happy that if they [...] carry on that way, they're probably better doing it away from us." [...] On 27 July, Juventus confirmed on their official website that Pogba had undergone a medical at the club, and the transfer was completed on 3 August, when he signed a four-year contract. He made his first appearance for Juventus in a pre-season friendly against Benfica in Geneva on 1 August, coming on as a 78th-minute substitute for Andrea Pirlo.|$|E
500|$|Edna Gunderson of USA Today was positive, commenting, [...] "The music, while upbeat {{and even}} giddy, steers away from {{adolescent}} pranks and pratfalls, a welcome upgrade. The band creates a fresh breed of post-punk power pop by roughing up bright melodies." [...] AllMusic's Brian O'Neill gave the album three stars, {{calling it a}} [...] "far cry from the party-boy ethos DeLonge is best known for, and he wears the emotional depth well, with songs that are just as hooky as from his bread-winning main squeeze." [...] A reviewer for Q admitted that the musicians [...] "confound expectations with a very good record." [...] The positive reception of the album was {{in contrast to the}} reviews for Blink, which were often negative. [...] "I think it's a cop-out for [...] to like the music I do," [...] DeLonge told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "Critics can't say they like Blink or give <b>us</b> <b>any</b> credit, 'cause we're out there goofing around." [...] Barker was more critical: [...] "I especially don't care what the critics say. Most of them are like 50 years old and they're not really educated in what kind of music we're playing to begin with!" ...|$|E

[...] Blessy Chettiar of DNA India, noted the music of the film and Farhan Akhtar's acting as highlights of the film: [...] "For all this, the storywriters use heavy doses of symbolism. Deep-sea diving at Costa Brava, sky-diving in Sevilla and the San Fermin bull run in Pamplona, not to forget the Tomatina festival in Bunyol, where Arjun finally lets go. Fears are drowned, let open in the sky and finally at the mercy of raging bulls", he wrote, giving it 3 stars. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN stated, [...] "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara takes the light-hearted tone of a fun, all-boys road trip through Spain to give you a deep and heartfelt message on why we should live life by seizing the moment and following our hearts." [...] He also praised the performance of the cast, highlighting it as one of the main positives of the film, but points out that the film's length [...] "sucks some fun of out of the ride" [...] and gave a rating of 3.5 stars. On the contrary, Raja Sen of Rediff held that the film [...] "tried too hard to be cool" [...] and gave it 1.5/5 stars.|$|E
500|$|As the {{previously}} prolific band were unusually quiet, the UK music press began to speculate. Melody Maker {{calculated that the}} total recording cost had come close to £250,000; however, McGee, Green, and Shields dispute this. Shields argued that that estimated cost (and Creation's near-bankruptcy) was a myth exaggerated by McGee because the Creation owner [...] "thought it would be cool." [...] According to Shields, [...] "The amount we spent nobody knows because we never counted. But we worked it out ourselves just by working out how much the studios cost and how much all the engineers cost. 160 thousand pounds was the most we could come to as the actual money that was spent." [...] In Green's opinion, the Melody Maker's estimate erred on the low side, by £20,000. He said, [...] "Once you'd even got it recorded and mixed, {{the very act of}} compiling, EQ-ing, etcetera took weeks on its own." [...] In a December 1991 interview, Shields said that most of the money claimed to have been spent on the album was simply [...] "money to live on" [...] over three years, with the album itself only costing [...] "a few thousand". He also claimed that the album represented only four months work over two years. Shields later said that most of the money spent was the band's own money, and that [...] "Creation probably spent fifteen to twenty thousand pounds of their own money on it, and that's it. They never showed <b>us</b> <b>any</b> accounts, and then they got bought out by Sony." ...|$|E

50|$|Since the 1944 {{signing of}} the Convention on International Civil Aviation, {{international}} aviation was based on bilateral air transport agreements, in which government would negotiate the rights {{of one or more}} flag carriers to operate routes between the countries. The negotiations focused on retaining each country's flag carrier's market share and also effectively hindered any airline from not being domestically owned—either by the government or by private investors. In 1992, the United States started negotiating open skies agreements with the European Union (EU), which would allow any European airline to fly from any airport in their home country to any airport in the <b>US,</b> and similarly <b>any</b> <b>US</b> airline to fly from <b>any</b> <b>US</b> airport to <b>any</b> European airport.|$|R
