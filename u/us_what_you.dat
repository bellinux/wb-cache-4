500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a 'B-', stating [...] "I've defended this show against {{complaints}} that it’s terminally bland, but formulaic material like this really does expose its flaws. It’s definitely not an unwatchably bad show ... In short: don’t be shy, Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. Show <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can do." [...] He did praise the visual {{effects in the}} episode though, saying, [...] "This week’s episode {{had a couple of}} very nicely-staged set pieces and, especially for broadcast TV, some excellent special effects. Fire is hard to pull off, even in a blockbuster movie, but this episode revolved around a character ... who can generate and manipulate fire, and everything he did looked pretty cool." [...] Morgan Jeffrey at Digital Spy scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, calling it a [...] "slow burn", and concluding that [...] "Skye's arc is easily the weakest aspect of [...] "Girl in the Flower Dress" [...] but there's a decent villain and a strong climax to help compensate." [...] Will Salmon of SFX also scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, stating [...] "a shade more mature than the initial installments. It’s a welcome growth, and it does feel like Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. is getting itself together. They found the right levels of warmth and humanity last week, and humour and drama this time around. Now they just need to start going on some genuinely compelling missions against decent enemies." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt the series [...] "has settled into a pragmatic, if sometimes predictable comfort zone", and said that the episode [...] "delivered enough premise, pace, and patter to get its audience through a mellow hour — and set the bar higher {{for the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{first began}} to exhibit {{symptoms}} {{at the age of}} 29 but continued to work in the asbestos mill until 22 July 1922, when she was certified unfit to work. Because Kershaw's medical certificate (produced by her local physician Dr Walter Scott Joss) recorded the diagnosis as [...] "asbestos poisoning" [...] she was ineligible for National Health Insurance sickness benefits. As the illness was linked to her occupation, the insurers advised her that she should instead seek sickness benefits from her employers, under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and wrote to Turner Brothers on her behalf on several occasions. However, Turner Brothers refused to pay any benefits because asbestos-related illness was not a recognised occupational disease at that time, and instructed their insurance company to [...] "repudiate the claim" [...] as it would be [...] "exceedingly dangerous" [...] to accept [...] "any liability whatever in such a case." [...] Percy George Kenyon, Turner's works' manager at Rochdale, wrote to Dr Joss demanding that he [...] "inform <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have said to Miss [...] Kershaw about suffering from Asbestos poisoning" [...] and then wrote to the medical insurance board stating that [...] "We repudiate the term [...] "Asbestos Poisoning". Asbestos is not poisonous and no definition or knowledge of such a disease exists. Such a description is not to be found amongst the list of industrial diseases in the schedule published with the Workmen's Compensation Act." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brain {{replacement}} scenario:In this, we {{are asked}} to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue {{that there would be}} no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins. Searle predicts that, while going through the brain prosthesis, [...] "you find, to your total amazement, that you are indeed losing control of you external behavior. You find, for example, that when doctors test your vision, you hear them say 'We are holding up a red object in front of you; please tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> see.' You want to cry out 'I can't see anything. I'm going totally blind.' But you hear your voice saying in a way that is completely out your control, 'I see a red object in front of me.' [...] our conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, while your externally observable behavior remains the same." [...] This response, however, is impossible, as identical signals would be sent to the remaining organic regions of the brain as would be sent under normal circumstances, by the definition of the behavior of the hypothetical computers. (See Ship of Theseus for a similar thought experiment.) ...|$|E
