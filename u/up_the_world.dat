5|$|In the 2007 World Cup England {{played in}} Pool A with Samoa, Tonga, South Africa and the United States. They {{qualified}} for the quarter finals after losing embarrassingly to South Africa 36–0 where they defeated Australia 12–10, and then faced hosts France in their semi final. England won 14–9 {{to qualify for the}} final against South Africa, which they lost 15–6. England followed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Cup with two consecutive 2nd place finishes in the Six Nations, behind Wales and Ireland respectively. The 2009 Six Nations also saw former England Captain Martin Johnson take up the job of head coach. However, Johnson could not replicate his on-field success to management, and resigned in November 2011 following a miserable 2011 Rugby World Cup which ended in quarter-final defeat by France and featured a series of on and off-field controversies.|$|E
5|$|Edwin Ekiring was {{the sole}} {{representative}} for Uganda in the men's singles for Badminton. He was 28 {{years old and had}} competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Ekiring qualified for the Games because he was granted the automatic qualification slot for one player in the African continent partly due to him being placed 98 in the BWF World Ranking in May 2012. He said that his experiences in previous Olympic Games would aid him in progressing <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> rankings. On 28 July, Ekiring played against Brice Leverdez of France in the group stage, whom he lost against in the first round 12–21 and was defeated by his opponment 11–21 in the second round in a 26-minute match. Ekiring's next game was against Hong Kong's Wong Wing Ki two days later whom he lost against in a 26-minute match, scoring ten points while his opponent reached 21 points. He was also defeated in his second round match with a 13-point deficit to Wing Ki and, therefore, he was eliminated from the competition.|$|E

25|$|In the Uttara Kanda of Valmiki's Ramayana, Durvasa {{appears at}} Rama's {{doorstep}} and seeing Lakshmana guarding the door, demands {{an audience with}} Rama. At the time, Rama was having a private conversation with Yama(the god of death) disguised as an ascetic. Before the conversation began, Yama gave Rama strict instructions that their dialogue was to remain confidential and anyone who entered the room and saw or heard them was to be executed. Rama agreed and entrusted Lakshman with the duty of guarding his door and fulfilling his promise to Yama. Thus, when Durvasa made his demand, Lakshman politely asked the sage to wait until Rama had finished his meeting. The sage grew angry and threatened to curse all of Ayodhya if Lakshman did not immediately inform Rama of his arrival. Lakshman, in a dilemma, {{decided it would be}} better that he alone die to save all of Ayodhya from falling under Durvasa's curse and so interrupted Rama's meeting to inform him of the sage's arrival. Rama quickly concluded his meeting with Yama and received the sage with due courtesy. Durvasa told Rama of his desire to be fed and Rama fulfilled his guest's request, whereupon the satisfied sage went on his way. Rama was overcome with sorrow, for {{he did not want to}} kill his beloved brother, Lakshman. Still, he had given his word to Yama and could not go back on it. He called his advisers to help him resolve this quandary. On Vasishta's advice, he ordered Lakshman to leave him for good, since such abandonment was equivalent to death as far as the pious were concerned. Lakshman then went to the banks of the Sarayu, resolved on giving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> through Yoga.|$|E

500|$|One-third of the world's bishops petitioned for the canonization of Escrivá. During the canonization, {{there were}} 42 {{cardinals}} and 470 bishops {{from around the}} world, generals superior of many religious institutes, and representatives of various Catholic groups. During those days, these Church officials commented on the universal reach {{and validity of the}} message of the founder. For his canonization homily, John Paul II said: With the teachings of St. Josemaría, [...] "it is easier to understand what the Second Vatican Council affirmed: 'there is no question, then, of the Christian message inhibiting men from building <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> ... on the contrary it is an incentive to do these very things' (Vatican II, Gaudium et spes, n. 34)." ...|$|E

Astrological themes appeared in many other cults in the Roman Empire, including another mystery cult, dedicated to Mithras. In the Isis cult, astrological symbolism may have alluded {{to the belief that}} Isis governed the movements of the stars and thus the passage of time and the order of the cosmos, beliefs that Lucius refers to when praying to the goddess.|$|E

Although the report acknowledged Monica as the only character with whom test audiences identified somewhat positively, NBC admitted that reception towards the character was [...] "well below desirable levels for a lead" [...] nonetheless. In retrospect, The New Republic's Andrew Harrison believes that although Monica and her friends [...] "were superficial, self-absorbed and at first difficult to like ... in their solipsism and neurosis they reflected and sent <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> emerging around them ... far more accurately than any conventional gooey-hearted family sitcom", ultimately [...] "creat a coffee-scented cocoon that millions wanted to enter". Reviews gradually improved; an early critical evaluation of Friends, which had pegged Cox as the show's star, read, [...] "As Monica, [...] came across as charming, attractive, confident, and motivated – {{the leader of the}} group". While men found the actress attractive, women appreciated her sense of humor.|$|E

500|$|The {{problem with}} metaphysical realism, {{according}} to Putnam, {{was that it}} fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth. According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the pre-structured categories, kinds and individuals that are inherent in the external world. But {{how is it possible}} that the world [...] "carves up" [...] into certain structures and categories, the mind carves <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> into its own categories and structures, and the two [...] "carvings" [...] perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the world does not come pre-structured but that structure must be imposed on it by the human mind and its conceptual schemes. [...] In Reason, Truth, and History, Putnam identified truth with what he termed [...] "idealized rational acceptability." [...] The theory, which owes something to C. S. Peirce, is that a belief is true if it would be accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.|$|E
