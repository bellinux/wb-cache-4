5|$|The fort was {{surveyed}} {{and described}} by R.G. Collingwood in his Archaeology of Roman Britain, 1930, where {{he noted the}} fort's uniquely skewed shape and extraordinary set of defensive ramparts on the western, <b>uphill</b> <b>side.</b> Pottery excavated in the 1950s suggested that the fort was constructed in 122 AD, {{at the same time}} as Hadrian's Wall. A survey in 2007–8 by English Heritage showed a large Roman civilian settlement or vicus to the north and west of the fort. Artefacts found include coins, pottery, glass, objects made of jet, and inscribed stones. In 2012, the University of Durham carried out a geophysics survey as part of an English Heritage project. In the absence of a full excavation, archaeologists have exploited the diggings of moles to uncover Roman artefacts by sifting earth thrown up by the animals in their molehills. Finds include fragments of terra sigillata (Samian ware, Roman table pottery); rim fragments of serving bowls and earthenware pots; a bead made of jet; some iron nails; and a bronze dolphin from the bath house, most likely the handle of an instrument like a strigil or razor.|$|E

25|$|In this classification, skiers with {{cerebral}} palsy have difficulty walking in ski boots and sometimes require assistance when walking in them. When going up hill, they often have their weaker side on the <b>uphill</b> <b>side.</b> In learning to ski, a ski bra {{is often used to}} teach the proper technique. Skiers sometimes have difficulty with the snowplough technique. In teaching skiers with {{cerebral palsy}}, instructors are encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encourage as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement. Some skiers {{with cerebral palsy}} have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier with cerebral palsy may tie more quickly.|$|E
40|$|Dendrochronologists {{studying}} fire history must be strategic {{in their}} search for fire-scarred tree samples. Because it is desirable to extend the period of analysis in a site by looking for old scars, recent scars, and trees with large numbers of scars, researchers have developed rules of thumb regarding which trees are most likely to meet these goals as well as where fire scars {{are most likely to be}} found. To test our assumptions and quantify patterns about tree and sample characteristics, we analyzed a dataset of 2800 samples and 16, 036 scars. On average, logs had the oldest scars and live trees had the most recent scars, although both very old and very recent scars were found on snags and stumps. Scars tended to be located on the <b>uphill</b> <b>sides</b> of trees, particularly on steeper slopes. The number of years between pith date and first fire scar ranged from 2 to 473 years, with a median of 52 and a mean of 67. The data confirm that searching for a variety of sample types and looking on the <b>uphill</b> <b>sides</b> of trees are useful methods for efficient sampling and extending a fire history record...|$|R
5000|$|The Fort Sanders area {{became the}} site of many Victorian homes that were built {{approximately}} three decades later. Several, especially those located on the <b>uphill</b> <b>sides</b> of streets, are most impressive; some have been restored in recent decades. A few were incorporated into {{the grounds of the}} 1982 World's Fair. Many more have been divided into apartments and are rented out to University of Tennessee students. The author James Agee was from this area; the exteriors for the motion picture version of All the Way Home were shot outside one of the more palatial homes, which has since burned. Agee's novel, A Death in the Family, ends with Agee ("Rufus" [...] in the novel) and his uncle conversing while looking out over the ruins of Fort Sanders.|$|R
30|$|In surface fires where Reynolds {{numbers are}} high enough (i.e., where either gas {{velocities}} or stem diameters or both are large enough) that {{the interaction between}} flames and stems results in eddying and standing leeward flames, stem surface heat flux is uneven, both around the stem and vertically, creating leeward charring patterns and fire scars that are widest near the ground and taper up the stem (e.g., Gutsell and Johnson 1996, Inoue 1999). To date, field measurements of uneven heating of tree stems have focused on oncoming fires burning over flat ground (Gill 1974, Fahnestock and Hare 1964, Inoue 1999). Only one measurement of circumferential heat flux has been made, documenting the elevated heat fluxes that occur on the <b>uphill</b> <b>sides</b> of stems caused by slope-induced buoyant flow during fires, whether backing or heading (Bova and Dickinson 2009).|$|R
25|$|When falling, skiers in {{this class}} with above the knee amputations are taught {{to try to prevent}} the stump of their leg from hitting the snow as it can cause more damage to that leg than the one that is not {{partially}} missing. When working on side stepping, the skier is supported to keep the stump of their leg on the <b>uphill</b> <b>side.</b> Elite skiers are taught to avoid using outriggers as crutches. Skiers are taught to turn using their leg instead of their ski poles. Skiers {{in this class}} can use the outrigger to assist in maintaining their balance as they turn on the hill. A skier with an above the knee amputation may have a better ability to complete turns on the opposite of their amputation. In getting on ski lifts, skiers with above the knee amputations in this classification should lift their outriggers off the ground and point them forward.|$|E
500|$|Epiacum, however, has two unique features. Firstly, the fort's {{military}} engineers {{modified the}} usual rectangular plan {{to suit the}} available site: it is distorted into a lozenge or parallelogram; the internal features of the fort are similarly distorted.

50|$|Loch Castle {{consists}} of two caves sealed by stone walls. These caves are connected to a labyrinth of smaller rooms in the cave system. The largest space, with a floor area of 12.5 x 7 metres, {{was used as a}} residential area and was panelled with wood. It was heated by a fireplace that may still be seen today. The ceiling of this room has partly collapsed since the castle was abandoned, leaving it open to the surface. As a result, it may be entered from both the downhill and <b>uphill</b> <b>sides.</b> There are still brick walls and door spaces in this room. The cave is two storeys high, but the upper floor only has a small chamber. In addition other buildings were built outside the cave, against the rock face. The area around the cave was surrounded by a high curtain wall and protected by a zwinger.|$|R

2500|$|Writing in 1743, the {{antiquarian}} William Stukeley {{described the}} Whispering Knights as sitting upon a round barrow, something that Lambrick accepted as being [...] "reasonable {{in the context}} of a portal dolmen", however he cautioned against accepting such an explanation too readily. He went on to argue that a [...] "mound-like effect" [...] could have been created at the base of the monument if ploughing in later centuries had led to the accumulation of soil around the dolmen's <b>uphill</b> <b>side</b> and the removal of it on the downhill side. Excavation failed to provide evidence to prove either suggestion, leaving the issue [...] "ambiguous"; Lambrick noted however that there was a possibility that some of the stratigraphic layers [...] "may represent the base of some sort of cairn" [...] around the Whispering Knights.|$|E

50|$|Puerto Rico Highway 172 {{has about}} 4 {{kilometers}} going <b>uphill.</b> One <b>side</b> {{of the road}} is extremely close to the blasted mountain (See Blasting), meaning that landslides would fall in the right lane of the direction close to it; {{the other side is}} near a precipice, with barriers that are not safe. The two directions are not divided, and cars can easily collide front-to-front. Several people have died in this highway, including cars which have been collided by heavy-weight trucks that come so fast downhill their brakes malfunction or don't have to time to stop. The most recent death occurred August 16, 2014. Only one emergency ramp has been built to provide safety in the down part of the mountain.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, the Keauhou Beach Hotel {{was built}} on the point South of the bay.The hotel was bought in 1987 for $13M by the Azabu Building Company, headed by Japanese {{businessman}} Kitaro Watanabe.

40|$|Microirrigation plants, if {{properly}} designed, {{allow for}} water use efficiency to be optimized and high values of emission uniformity to be {{obtained in the}} field. Disposing paired laterals, for which two distribution pipes extend in opposite directions from a common manifold, can contribute to reducing the initial investment cost that represents a limiting factor for small-scale farmers of developing countries where in the last decade, the diffusion of such irrigation systems has been increasing. The objective {{of this paper is}} to propose an analytical approach to evaluate the maximum lengths of paired drip laterals for any uniform ground slope, respecting the criteria to maintain emitter flow rates or the corresponding pressure heads within fixed ranges in order to achieve a relatively high field emission uniformity coefficient. The method is developed by considering the motion equations along <b>uphill</b> and downhill <b>sides</b> of the lateral and the hypothesis to neglect the variations of emitters’ flow rate along the lateral as well as the local losses due to emitters’ insertions. If for the uphill pipe, the minimum and the maximum pressure heads occur at the upstream end and at the manifold connection, respectively, on the downhill side, the minimum pressure head is located in a certain section of the lateral, depending on the geometric and hydraulic characteristics of the lateral, as well as on the slope of the field; a second relative maximum pressure head could also exist at the downstream end of the pipe. The proposed methodology allows in particular the number of emitters in <b>uphill</b> and downhill <b>sides</b> of the lateral to be determined separately, and therefore, once fixing emitter’s spacing, the length of the uphill and downhill laterals and the position of the manifold. Applications and validation of the proposed approach, considering different design parameters, are finally presented and discussed...|$|R
50|$|The semi-final of the Munster Championship saw Kerry take on Cork, {{the reigning}} All-Ireland champions. In spite of facing an <b>uphill</b> battle Mahony’s <b>side</b> easily {{defeated}} ‘the Rebels’ by 2-7 to 0-3. This victory allowed Kerry {{to advance to}} the Munster final where Limerick provided the opposition. The death of Charles Stewart Parnell and the political tensions of the era meant that the playing of game was in doubt; however, it eventually went ahead. Kerry, however, were defeated on that occasion by 1-2 to 1-1. Kerry, however, launched an objection and were successful, thus forcing a replay. Kerry were far superior in the second game, displaying their overhead and ground skills, and defeated Limerick by 2-4 to 0-1. This victory allowed Kerry {{to advance to the}} All-Ireland where Wexford provided the opposition. The game itself was the second game of a triple-header played at Clonturk Park on 28 February 1892. The first game that day was the All-Ireland football semi-final between Dublin and Cavan. This was followed by the All-Ireland furling final and the programme of games finished with the All-Ireland football final between Cork and the winners of the first game. The hurling decider was an exciting affair with the Kerry team playing in their bare feet in grey jumpers with a gold band. Paddy 'Carr' Carroll scored Kerry’s first point after five minutes with the team’s second score coming after another twenty minutes. At half-time Kerry led by 0-2 to 0-1. The game, however, was not without controversy. At full-time the referee said that the score was 1-1 apiece and that extra-time was necessary. The Kerry team were reluctant to play the extra thirty minutes with captain Mahony one of the most vocal opponents. It was only after being persuaded by the chairman of the Kerry County Board that the team decided to line out for a third half-hour of hurling. Both sides upped their games considerably for the only occasion that extra time was played in an All-Ireland final. Kerry {{went on to win the}} game by 2-3 to 1-5 to capture their first and only All-Ireland title.|$|R
