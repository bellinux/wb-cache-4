25|$|Vincent and Emma's {{conversation}} {{is cut off}} by a scream. Wittering has been injured and can no longer continue in the game. Headingley CC needs 10 more runs to win, {{but there is no}} one to take Wittering's place alongside Donald. The Earl laments the bad day for Headingley. ("Wittering's Final Innings") Vincent suddenly speaks <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> he will take Wittering's place. ("The Making of St. Leger") He joins Donald and the game continues – to the amazement of the cricketers, who believed Vincent had no redeeming qualities. Vincent is beaten up badly during the game, but keeps playing.|$|E
500|$|Another project Townsend has {{mentioned}} several times between 2009 and 2012 is Obviouser, an album featuring [...] "creepy, bass driven apocalyptic music" [...] created with an [...] "Ampeg rig" [...] and an [...] "Icelandic choir". Working with many projects simultaneously at that time, Townsend stated in 2012 the Obviouser project is vying for pole position until [...] "he wakes <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> 'he {{wants to do}} it'".|$|E

500|$|The Family Guy episode [...] "Wasted Talent" [...] {{features}} an end scene {{similar to the}} ending of [...] "Time Enough At Last". In the Family Guy version, a lone brain cell discovers {{it is the last}} of its kind, and with a book in hand and stacks of other books surrounding him, prepares to begin reading, but looks down and his glasses shatter, after which, dismayed, he picks them <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> [...] " [...] No! It's not fair! There was finally going to be TIME!...", much like what happens to Mr. Bemis.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{score was}} composed by Carter Burwell, {{a veteran of}} all the Coen Brothers' films. While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had Kenny Rogers' [...] "Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition Was in)", the Gipsy Kings' cover of [...] "Hotel California", and several Creedence Clearwater Revival songs in mind. They asked T-Bone Burnett (who would later work with the Coens on O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Inside Llewyn Davis) to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, [...] "T-Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac." [...] Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by Captain Beefheart, Moondog and Bob Dylan's [...] "The Man in Me" [...] (from New Morning). However, he {{had a tough time}} securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt's cover of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Dead Flowers", which plays over the film's closing credits. Former Stones manager Allen Klein owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, [...] "It got to the part where the Dude says, 'I hate the fuckin' Eagles, man!' Klein stands <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'That's it, you can have the song!' That was beautiful." [...] Burnett was going to be credited on the film as [...] "Music Supervisor", but asked his credit to be [...] "Music Archivist" [...] because he [...] "hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldn't want anyone to think of me as management".|$|E
2500|$|Early-teen {{marriage}} was possible in Judaism. In Judaism girls reach adulthood at 12 and boys at 13. According to the Talmud, a father is commanded {{not to let}} his his daughter marry anyone until she grows <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "I want this one". A marriage that takes place {{without the consent of}} the girl is not an effective legal marriage.|$|E

2500|$|When {{you write}} a song and you mean it one way, and someone comes <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> {{something}} about it that you didn't think of—you can't deny it. Like [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds," [...] people came up and said, cunningly, [...] "Right, I get it. L-S-D," [...] and it was when papers were talking about LSD, but we never thought about it.|$|E
2500|$|However, the {{preceding}} quote {{has often been}} misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined. What Vivekananda actually meant by lack of free will was that the will was not [...] "free" [...] because it was heavily influenced by the law {{of cause and effect}} – [...] "The will is not free, it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect, but there is something behind the will which is free." [...] Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter one's past karma: [...] "It is the coward and the fool who says this is his fate. But it is the strong man who stands <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> I will make my own fate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{limited number}} of appearances, the {{character}} of Darius has an important moral influence in the show. Horvath remarks, [...] "When he joined the show {{it was the first}} time that someone started talking about peace." [...] She explains, [...] "The arrival of Darius, aside from bringing in a great character, represented the first time that someone questioned the basic premise of the show. The basic premise is that 's a hero and he goes around kicking the ass of the bad guys. Now you have this character in Darius who shows <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'Yes, but is it actually a good goal to kick the ass of the bad guys?' Even though Mac has to be a good guy who has to fight the bad guys, you set up this scenario where one of his closest friends has questioned whether beating up bad guys makes you a good guy or whether you should be a man of peace. (...) That underlying question shaped the whole rest of the series." [...] Abramowitz says further, [...] "It was a major moment for MacLeod. And {{it was the first time}} for him when he believed that the way of the warrior may not be the only way." [...] Abramowitz summarizes, [...] "Darius was the voice of God on the show, and then God died." ...|$|E

2500|$|Grohl {{described}} this song as such; [...] "Wind Up {{is about the}} press. It {{has to do with}} me reading about people that... I mean there's certain musicians who have nothing better to do than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for what they have been given, and if you don't want it, then fucking just quit and get away from it. It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> that he likes their band. And it also has to do with... I mean there are two sides: there's the reluctant rock-star, {{and then there is the}} prying journalist that almost lives for the reluctant rock-star, it's just talking [...] "about the hand you've been dealt." [...] Every time I hear about [...] "the hand you've been dealt," [...] it drives me fucking nuts, spare me your confessions. And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I've had so many fucking bullshit jobs for the half of my life - you know, working in furniture warehouses and planting trees, painting houses - and it's a lot more fun to play music." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2001, Spriggs said, “People {{are failing}} to think of their own {{personal}} experience {{to use as a}} base to talk about racism. That's {{a big part of the}} problem.

It's hard to stand <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> lots of us finished high school and college and got jobs but are still not where our white counterparts are in the workplace.
