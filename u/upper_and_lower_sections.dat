5|$|The Chenes {{style is}} very similar to the Puuc style, but predates the use of the mosaic façades of the Puuc region. It {{featured}} fully adorned façades on both the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>sections</b> of structures. Some doorways were surrounded by mosaic masks of monsters representing mountain or sky deities, identifying the doorways as entrances to the supernatural realm. Some buildings contained interior stairways that accessed different levels. The Chenes style is most commonly encountered in the southern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula, although individual buildings in the style can be found elsewhere in the peninsula. Examples of Chenes sites include Dzibilnocac, Hochob, Santa Rosa Xtampak, and Tabasqueño.|$|E

Longfin {{trevally}} are commonly found on rocky and coral coastlines, often inhabiting reef complexes, with solitary individuals or groups of larger fish patrolling the edges of reefs. They are also found in shallow, sandy bays and lagoons, with juveniles known to enter and use estuaries as nursery areas.|$|E

In the <b>Lower</b> <b>Section</b> are seven scoring categories: One Word, Two Words (at the same turn), Three Words (at the same turn), All Consonants, All Vowels (the consonant Y is considered a vowel in this game), Yahtzee Word (a seven-letter-word), and Chance.|$|R
25|$|The Burial of the Count of Orgaz (Spanish: El Entierro del Conde de Orgaz) is a {{painting}} by El Greco, a Greek painter, sculptor, and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. Widely considered among his finest works, it illustrates a popular local legend of his time. An exceptionally large painting, it is very clearly divided into two sections, heavenly above and terrestrial below, but it gives little impression of duality. The <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>sections</b> are brought together compositionally.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the opening}} of their first season, the Sounders already had {{the highest number of}} season ticket holders in the MLS after they sold all 22,000 of the offered season ticket packages. The team created a web site that was used to {{identify}} seating arrangements for season ticket holders based on personal interests including preferred method for watching a game and foreign team preference. For {{the first half of the}} inaugural season, the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>sections</b> were tarped off, limiting the seating capacity to 27,700. The club hoped to create an intimate environment as well as a supply-and-demand factor that would reward season ticket holders and encourage early purchase of seats. The stadium has continuously sold out league matches in the limited seating configuration. However, majority owner Joe Roth has said that he [...] "won't be happy" [...] until the entire venue is open.|$|E
25|$|As designed, the R.II {{was a large}} three-bay biplane with unstaggered {{wings of}} unequal span and a fully {{enclosed}} cabin. Power was to be supplied by three 180-kW (240-hp) Maybach HS engines mounted internally in the fuselage, which transmitted their power via driveshafts to two propellers mounted tractor-fashion on the interplane struts nearest the fuselage. The main undercarriage consisted of divided units, each of which carried dual wheels, and the tail {{was supported by a}} pair of tailwheels. The fueslage was forked into an <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>section,</b> which allowed a clear field of fire {{to the rear of the}} aircraft.|$|R

The main undercarriage consisted of divided units, each of which carried dual wheels, and the tail {{was supported by a}} pair of tailwheels. The rear fuselage structure [...] was forked into an <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>section,</b> which allowed a clear field of fire {{to the rear of the}} aircraft.

500|$|The XBTM-1 was a low-wing, {{all-metal}} monoplane with folding {{wings to}} allow more compact storage in carrier hangar decks, and conventional landing gear. Its fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque with the single-seat cockpit and its teardrop-shaped [...] canopy positioned just aft of the air-cooled engine. Just behind the cockpit was a [...] fuel tank. The large wing consisted of a two-spar center section with hydraulically-folded three-spar outer panels. A large dive brake was positioned on {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. When closed it could be lowered for use as a landing flap or it could be split into alternating <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>sections,</b> with intermeshing [...] "fingers" [...] for use in its intended role. It was very effective in this role, mainly due to its great surface area, but this was at the cost of the width of the ailerons, which significantly reduced their efficiency. A pair of [...] fuel tanks were positioned in the roots of the center section. All fuel tanks were self sealing and the pilot and oil cooler were protected by [...] of armor.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} Beaver Creek Valley State Park {{was caught in}} a dispute between fishing and birdwatching interests. [...] To improve the habitat for large trout, {{fisheries}} staff were setting rocks {{along the banks of the}} creek to prevent erosion and create overhangs where the fish could hide. [...] However Louisiana waterthrushes and sometimes cerulean warblers nest at the base of creekside trees, some of which were being removed to make space for the rocks. [...] After a public battle over the state's wildlife management policies, the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>sections</b> of East Beaver Creek were modified and the middle section left alone.|$|E
50|$|To handle {{rapidly growing}} mail volumes, the United States Postal Service {{installed}} the first semiautomatic sorting machine on April 10, 1957. The Transorma Letter Sorting Machine, manufactured by the Dutch company Werkspoor and {{distributed in the}} United States by Pitney Bowes, consisted of an <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>section,</b> a conveyor belt transport {{and a series of}} five sorting keyboards. Operators read the destination and keyed a sorting code. The letter was then automatically transferred to a letter tray and deposited into one of 300 chutes. The Transorma could sort 15,000 letters per hour, double the amount that the same number of clerks could do by hand.|$|R

5000|$|The Hollow Tree is a {{more than}} one-hundred-year-old maple. It reaches a 21-metre high and 1.7-metre in diameter. It is called [...] "hollow tree" [...] {{because it has a}} huge hole inside the tree. The hole has {{openings}} in both <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>section</b> of the tree. It is once said that there was a honeycomb and villagers tried to fire the comb but finally fired the tree altogether. However, the explanations from the description board of the tree told another cause. The parenchya cells in the centre of the trunk contracted and withered as a result of infection. Small holes began to appear inside the tree. However, the nutrients and moisture transporting cells around the exterior part of the trunk continued to grow and thicken. The trunk later get thicker, and the centre hollow expanded in tandem.|$|R
