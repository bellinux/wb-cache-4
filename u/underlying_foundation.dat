The objective of life is considered the achievement of separation of pure consciousness from matter (kaivalya). The reasoning within this system led to the Nir-isvara Sāṃkhya (Sāṃkhya without God) philosophy, which deemed the existence of God as unnecessary. There is the opposing reasoning which accepts God, called Sesvara Sankhya (Sāṃkhya with God). Samkhya Karika (c. 350 CE) is the earliest known systematic text of this philosophy.|$|E

Despite the lack of consensus and clarity regarding the meaning of early numeracy, van de Rijt (1996) as reported by Torbeyns, et al.

However, depending on the culture, there was variation in the amount of time taken between turns. Stivers claims that their evidence from examining these languages suggests that there is an underlying universal aspect to turn-taking.|$|E

50|$|An {{embankment}} dam {{is a massive}} artificial water barrier. It is typically created by the emplacement and compaction of a complex semi-plastic mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such a dam impervious to surface or seepage erosion.The force of the impoundment creates a downward thrust upon {{the mass of the}} dam, greatly increasing the weight of the dam on its foundation. This added force effectively seals and makes waterproof the <b>underlying</b> <b>foundation</b> of the dam, at the interface between the dam and its stream bed. Such a dam is composed of fragmented independent material particles. The friction and interaction of particles binds the particles together into a stable mass rather than by the use of a cementing substance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three contributions. First, it recognizes a set of key security issues for information systems (IS), and examines {{the extent to which}} these issues have been studied and resolved by existing research efforts. Second, it analyses and discusses the existing approaches for designing secure information systems (SIS), shedding light on their <b>underlying</b> <b>foundations.</b> Third, based on the findings, a framework is put forth, addressing the fundamental shortcomings of the existing SIS design approaches. A meta-notation for adding security into IS development methods is presented as a framework-based example. An action research intervention is accomplished to test the relevance, suitability and feasibility of the meta-notation in practice. Overall, this dissertation sets forth a novel approach for extending security in IS/software development methods...|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{assessments}} of ground failure potential commonly express seismic demands {{in the form}} of shear stresses or normalizations thereof. In soil materials <b>underlying</b> <b>foundations,</b> referred to as ‘foundation soils’, dynamic stresses result from wave propagation associated with site response in combination with demands associated with soil-structure interaction (SSI). Engineers presently lack a simplified procedure for analysis of SSI-related stress demands. To provide insight into the physics of the SSI-induced stresses, and to lay the ground work for an eventual simplified procedure, this paper presents preliminary solutions for the problem of a dynamic vertical point load on the surface of an elastic half-space (Lamb’s problem) and the resulting stresses within foundation soils. Results are presented in dimensionless graphical form and indicate the amplitude and phase of dynamic stresses...|$|R

We define the problem of consistency-checking of interactionstates as a key step in the design concept validation. We present a polynomial time algorithm for solving the interaction consistency-checking problem. We also present an algorithm for analyzing inconsistent interaction-states and identifying the inconsistent interactions. We believe that the framework described in this paper will provide the <b>underlying</b> <b>foundations</b> for constructing the next generation software tools for conceptual design of complex mechatronic systems...|$|R

The Oracle explains to Neo that he and Smith have become equal in power and that Smith is Neo's negative, a result of the Matrix's equation trying to balance itself. She tells Neo that Smith will destroy both the Matrix and the real world unless he is stopped. Smith soon assimilates the Oracle, gaining her power of foresight, or omniscience, and later manifests reality-bending powers equivalent to Neo's, such as the ability to fly. Meanwhile, in the real world, Bane (now under Smith's control) stows away on a ship being used by Neo and Trinity and tries to kill them both. Neo is blinded in the fight, but discovers that he can now sense Smith's essence acutely enough to land a blow that kills Bane.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{the first}} book is a {{universal}} Jewish guidebook to avodah, everyday Divine service, through Schneur Zalman's innovative system, applying Jewish mysticism step-by-step to the internal drama of human psychology. As a formative approach guidebook in Judaism, the English translator of the first section, in his introduction, compares its position with Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed, but contrasts the spiritual guidance aim of Tanya with the philosophical aim of Maimonides. The second section's philosophical exposition of Hasidic mystical Panentheism is the <b>underlying</b> <b>foundation</b> for contemplation methods in the first part, and gives the theoretical definition of Hasidism's theology of God. The third section guides individuals in a Habad Hasidic approach to repentance, {{to be able to}} prepare more deeply for the first part's guidance. The last two added sections give more complicated and in-depth Hasidic exposition of Kabbalistic concepts, the author uniting abstract ideas with the importance of everyday service and an emotion that must accompany it. These discourses are similar to the exegetical commentaries of Schneur Zalman in his other works, though here they sometimes take the form of letters to his followers, with more direct advice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Decision making {{consists}} in choosing, {{on the basis}} of various criteria, an appropriate subset of actions among a set of alternatives. The most research related to this field proceeds by aggregating all the criteria in a single objective function and rank alternatives according to this scalar measure. Unfortunately, this is often quite inadequate because it risks to alter the final decision. To discard this drawback, outranking based centralized methods have been proposed. However, they remain insufficient because they don't match with the logical distribution of criteria. That is why we propose a distributed approach which finds out the best compromise between all criteria by considering them as cooperative agents. The <b>underlying</b> <b>foundations</b> are detailed and illustrated via both an example and experimentation.

50|$|Foundations {{or group}} of {{foundations}} are important components of the structure through which the superficial structural loads are transmitted to the <b>underlying</b> <b>foundation</b> soil or bed on which the foundations are laid. The structural loads are transmitted to the foundation soil safely such that neither the foundation fail nor the foundation soil fails either in shear or in excessive settlement. The foundations are basically designed based on two criterion namely Bearing Capacity and Settlement criterion. Many classical theories have been postulated for the isolated foundations by many pioneers like Terzhagi (1943), Meyerhoff (1963), Hansen (1970) and Vesic (1973). In general as per the Terzaghi (1943), when an isolated shallow foundation is loaded, the stress or the failure zone in the foundation soil extends in horizontal direction {{on either side of}} the footing to about twice the width of the footing and in vertical downward direction to about three times the width of the footing. Unless until the stress or failure zone of individual footings do not interfere, the individual footings behave as an isolated footing. However, in many a situations such as lack of construction space, structural restrictions, rapid urbanization, architecture of the building, structures close to each other etc. In such situations the foundations {{or group of}} foundations may be placed close to each other. In such cases the stress isobars or the failure zone of closely spaced isolated footings may interfere with each other leading to the phenomenon called Interference. Owing to the phenomenon of footing interference, the failure mechanism, load-settlement, bearing capacity, settlement, rotational characteristics etc. of an isolated footing may be altered and therefore the classical theories as postulated in the literature for isolated footings cannot be applied. Due to interference the stress isobars of individual interacting footings coalesce to form a single isobar of larger dimensions altering the characteristic behavior of an isolated footing. Therefore, the study of interference of closely spaced footings is one of the significant practical importances.|$|E
