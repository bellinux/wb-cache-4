25|$|After {{preparation}} of the raw material, i.e., reducing cross-links between collagen components and removing some of the impurities such as fat and salts, partially purified collagen is converted into gelatin by extraction with either water or acid solutions at appropriate temperatures. All industrial processes are based on neutral or acid pH values because although alkali treatments speed <b>up</b> <b>conversion,</b> they also promote degradation processes. Acidic extraction conditions are extensively used in the industry, but the degree of acid varies with different processes. This extraction step is a multistage process, and the extraction temperature usually is increased in later extraction steps, which ensures minimum thermal degradation of the extracted gelatin.|$|E

5000|$|One {{interesting}} {{property of}} erbium oxides is {{their ability to}} up convert energy. Energy <b>up</b> <b>conversion</b> takes place when infrared or visible radiation, low energy light, is converted to ultraviolet or violet radiation higher energy light via multiple transfer or absorption of energy. [...] Erbium oxide nanoparticles also possess photoluminescence properties. Erbium oxide nanoparticles can be formed by applying ultrasound (20 kHz, 29 W·cm−2) {{in the presence of}} multiwall carbon nanotubes. The erbium oxide nanoparticles that have been successfully made by employing ultrasound are erbium carboxioxide, hexagonal and spherical geometry erbium oxide. Each ultrasonically formed erbium oxide is photoluminescence in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum under excitation of 379 nm in water. Hexagonal erbium oxide photoluminescence is long lived and allows higher energy transitions (4S3/2 - 4I15/2). Spherical erbium oxide does not experience 4S3/2 - 4I15/2 energy transitions.|$|E

To alleviate the LCD motion blur, im-proving the LC response is the most fundamental solution. How-ever, if the response time is shortened, then more frames are needed and hence frame rate <b>up</b> <b>conversion</b> (FRUC) should be used. In this paper, we study two FRUC methods. We compare the output signal qualities by studying the temporal and spatial profile of the two methods. We use the solution of Erickson-Leslie equation to de-rive the step response, in contrast to the existing literature where the resistor-capacitor (RC) approximation and uniform averaging function are used. The step response we derived is able to model not only the general trend of the rising and falling edges, but also the effects of different gray level transitions.
