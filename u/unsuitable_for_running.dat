50|$|LBB offers (typically) {{increased}} execution speed, smaller self-contained executables {{and some}} additional capabilities. However LBB is not 100% compatible with LB4 and whilst many programs will run without modification some {{may need to}} be adapted, or even be <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>running</b> under LBB.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{fragmentation}} of memory, each time a program terminated the FP-6000s operating system, known as Executive, would temporarily stop the other programs and recopy them to the lowest end of core. This way the available memory was always at the [...] "top". Although this technique eliminated the need for storing a list of memory blocks, {{it was at the}} cost of expensive copies every time a program ended. This would make the system <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>running</b> an operating system such as Unix, which is [...] "made up" [...] of a series of tiny programs that are frequently started and stopped, but Unix did not exist at the time, and the model for most operating systems was a sort of [...] "extended batch mode", running long-lived programs.|$|E
40|$|Due to its {{multitasking}} nature, the Windows {{operating system}} was initially {{thought to be}} <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>running</b> time-critical experiments (Myors, 1998, 1999). This con-cern {{was caused by the}} fact that two or more programs running on a single-processor multitasking system are not truly running in parallel. At any given moment, only one program is running, while the other programs are preempted by the operating system. Thus, what is gen-erally called multitasking is achieved by switching back and forth at a fast rate between several running and pre-empted programs. For the human user, the rate at which this switching occurs is too fast to notice, giving rise to the illusion that the programs are running in parallel. For daily use, this type of multitasking is satisfactory, but for ex-perimenters interested in measuring reaction times, it is...|$|E
50|$|Although a sound design, {{the class}} had limited {{usefulness}} {{as they were}} route-restricted by their high weight and were <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> fast <b>running</b> because of their short wheelbase. Largely confined to empty stock workings at London Paddington station, their lives were short; for example 1509 lasted barely ten years in BR service. Four of the class, 1506 to 1509, were based in Wales, Newport Pill, Ebbw Junction & Cardiff Canton, 1508 was withdrawn from that last shed. Like the 1600 and 9400 classes, their construction now {{appears to have been}} of doubtful value.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the lengthy}} {{pre-heating}} time, hot-bulb engines usually started easily, even in extremely cold conditions. This made them popular choices in cold regions, such as Canada and Scandinavia, where steam engines were not viable and early {{petrol and diesel}} engines could not be relied upon to operate. However it also makes them <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> short time <b>running</b> use especially in automobile.|$|R
5000|$|Water in the Green Pool is algae-free {{because of}} intense mineral content {{and it is}} <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> {{agriculture}}. Water <b>running</b> in streams, mainly seasonal, off the Great Dyke is potable but not used for agriculture until it has passed through a granite range that runs adjacent to the Dyke. The chrome and salt content of the water keep the water clear, a rare occurrence in Zimbabwe outside of the Eastern Highlands. Chrome Fines, a black, shiny powder-like substance, lies freely {{on the ground in}} many parts of the town, particularly after it has rained. Few plants grow well on the mineralised soils of Mutorashanga, making it <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> agriculture or grazing. Waterberry trees and phoenix palms are indigenous and grow on stream banks.|$|R
5000|$|The Syston and Peterborough Railway {{was opened}} in stages; {{the third and}} last section of line, between [...] and [...] opened for goods traffic on 20 March 1848, and for {{passengers}} on 1 May 1848. The station at Saxby opened on 1 February 1849, and was {{at the north end}} of a tight curve around a corner of Stapleford Park.The curve was considered <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> express trains <b>running</b> between Kettering and Nottingham via the Manton loop, so an easier curve was built in 1892 together with a new Saxby station, which opened on 28 August 1892. The original station on a stub of the original line continued in use for goods.|$|R
