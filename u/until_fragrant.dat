5000|$|The spiders are {{a species}} of {{tarantula}} called [...] "a-ping" [...] in Khmer, and are {{about the size of}} a human palm. The snacks cost about 300 riel each in 2002, or about US$ 0.08. One travel book identifies them as Haplopelma albostriatum, also known as the Thai zebra tarantula, and notes that the same species' common name has been the [...] "edible spider" [...] for more than a hundred years. The popularity of the dish is, however, a recent phenomenon, starting perhaps as late as the 1990s. The same book details a recipe: the spiders are tossed in a mixture of MSG, sugar, and salt; crushed garlic is fried in oil <b>until</b> <b>fragrant,</b> then the spiders are added and fried alongside the garlic until [...] "the legs are almost completely stiff, by which time the contents of the abdomen are not so runny." ...|$|E

The seasonings are tossed with a spatula <b>until</b> they are <b>fragrant,</b> then other ingredients are added, beginning with the ones taking the longest to cook, such as meat or tofu. When the meat and vegetables are nearly cooked, combinations of soy sauce, vinegar, wine, salt, or sugar may be added, along with thickeners such as cornstarch, water chestnut flour, or arrowroot.|$|R
2500|$|Su {{is called}} one of the four {{classical}} gastronomes. The other three are Ni Zan (1301–74), Xu Wei (1521–93), and Yuan Mei. There is a legend, for which unfortunately there is no evidence, that by accident he invented Dongpo pork, a famous dish in later centuries. Lin Hsiang Ju and Lin Tsuifeng in their scholarly Chinese Gastronomy give a recipe, [...] "The Fragrance of Pork: Tungpo Pork", and remark that the [...] "square of fat is named after Su Tungpo, the poet, for unknown reasons. Perhaps it is just because he would have liked it." [...] A story runs that once Su Dongpo decided to make stewed pork. Then an old friend visited {{him in the middle of}} the cooking and challenged him to a game of Chinese chess. Su had totally forgotten the [...] stew, which in the meantime had now become extremely thick-cooked, <b>until</b> its very <b>fragrant</b> smell reminded him of it.|$|R
