In 1988, it was nominated for Swedish music prize Grammis in a category 'Barn' (For Children).|$|E
500|$|Film is {{absolutely}} right for this project. It has scale, big exterior locations and that's something that still challenges HD.... The HD cameras available to <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> budget are still vulnerable in difficult weather conditions [...] There's no doubt that what we've got on 35mm is just so much more detailed. It has so much more depth of field and richness than we could have got on HD.|$|E

500|$|In the song's opening verse, Harrison {{admits that}} he [...] "Can't say what I'm doing here" [...] in the {{material}} world, a statement that theologian Dale Allison identifies as Kafkaesque until Harrison offers [...] "eschatological hope" [...] with the subsequent line, [...] "But I hope to see much clearer". Harrison then states that he uses his body [...] "like a car / Taking me both near and far". Author Ian Inglis regards this as an apt metaphor, since our bodies [...] "are merely the vehicles that carry <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> journeys".|$|E
500|$|On 18 April 2016, an {{official}} statement was released, cancelling {{the last leg}} of the RoXXXette 30th Anniversary Tour due to concerns about Marie Fredriksson's health. As her doctors have advised her to refrain from playing live, there will be no further Roxette tours. Fredriksson stated: [...] "Sadly, now my touring days are over and I want to take this opportunity to thank our wonderful fans that has followed <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> long and winding journey." [...] Gessle added: [...] "The joyride on the road is over now – but we sure had fun, didn't we?" ...|$|E
500|$|According to his colleagues, Hillenburg is [...] "a perfectionist workaholic". He is {{also known}} for his private nature. Julia Pistor, co-producer of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, noted that Hillenburg is [...] "very shy". She went on to say, [...] "He doesn't {{want people to know}} about his life or family. He's just a really funny, down-to-earth guy with a dry sense of humor who puts his family first and keeps <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> toes in keeping our {{corporate}} integrity." [...] Hillenburg said about himself, [...] "I make animation because I like to draw and create things. I have no real interest to be on camera or to be a celebrity. It's not that I don't like people, but I like having my privacy." ...|$|E

500|$|Coffin's {{college years}} were {{nonetheless}} a [...] "long grind", as she described it, with a seemingly unrelenting [...] "long routine of hard work" [...] relieved only by her summer abroad. She {{and the other}} three women in the program maintained a friendly competition with the male students which, she said, [...] "put <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> mettle to prove that we, too, were serious students and competitors. This association with many types of boys and men I found very helpful as we had a fine spirit of camaraderies in the drafting room and many a helping hand was given me at a critical moment, though one had to steel oneself to hear many a severe criticism, which was perhaps even more valuable." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} 1916 season started, {{it became clear}} that the Dodgers were one of the better teams in the league. Robinson managed to squeeze one more year of {{productivity}} out of some older veterans such as Chief Meyers, who said of Stengel, [...] "It was Casey who kept <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> toes. He was the life of the party and just kept all us old-timers [...] pepped up all season." [...] Stengel, mostly playing right field, hit [...]279 with eight home runs, one less than the team leader in that category, Wheat. Stengel's home run off Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander, who won 33 games that year, in the second game of a doubleheader on September 30, provided the margin of victory as the Dodgers went into first place to stay, qualifying for their first World Series, against the Boston Red Sox. Despite getting two hits in a Game 1 loss at Boston, Stengel was benched for Game 2 because the Red Sox were pitching a left hander, Babe Ruth, and Stengel hit better against right handers. Stengel, back in the lineup for Game 3, got a hit in Brooklyn's only victory of the series. He was benched again in Game 4 against left hander Dutch Leonard, though he was inserted as a pinch runner, and got another hit in the Game 5 loss, finishing 4 for 11, [...]364, the best Dodger batting average of the Series.|$|E
2500|$|Esch is {{a reserve}} deputy sheriff in his {{hometown}} of Jasper, Alabama, and starred in the reality television documentary entitled Big Law: Deputy Butterbean, which debuted on the Investigation Discovery channel in August 2011. He described the genesis of the show: [...] "They came to me wanting to do a reality documentary on my restaurant and I {{was in the process of}} closing my restaurant down. I said 'If you want something interesting and fun to watch, follow <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> drug busts in the sheriff's department.' They agreed people would be interested in this. [...] "They started following us, filming it and documenting us actually making the busts. You arrest somebody and say 'Look, if you don't want to go to jail you've got to help us bust a bigger guy.' We make a bigger bust from that. The whole goal is to get people on file and lessen the number of criminals on the streets." ...|$|E
5000|$|The verse that reads: [...] "All {{the people}} answered, 'His blood is <b>on</b> <b>us</b> and <b>on</b> <b>our</b> children!'" [...] is also {{referred}} to as the blood curse, and has caused more Jewish suffering throughout history than any other passage in the New Testament.|$|R

2500|$|Due to {{the notoriety}} {{surrounding}} how {{the band was}} signed with Durst, the band is often asked regarding their relationship with him. Scantlin criticized Durst {{in an interview in}} 2004 with Canada's Chart magazine. He stated, [...] "He doesn't write our songs, he doesn't produce our songs, he doesn't do anything for us. He doesn't do our videos anymore. He doesn't do anything for this band. I don't know what he's doing, I don't know what the guy's like. All I know is that he's like Mr. Hollywood guy, Mr. Celebrity. Like, 'I don't hang out with anybody except Hollywood celebrities'. Every single fucking interview I've ever fucking done, I get asked about that fucking guy..." [...] He added, [...] "And for me to do interviews all the time and be asked about this certain individual... People think he writes music with me or something. He does not do that. I just don't get it. We have nothing in common. He doesn't even call us, he has his assistant call us to congratulate <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> record. Yeah, that's how pathetic he is." ...|$|E
