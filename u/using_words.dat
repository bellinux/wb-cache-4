The problem {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between the method of composition and the quality of writing. The study also examined the interrelationship among word processing experience, method of composition, and quality of business writing. The purpose of the study was to produce research results to assist business communication teachers, budget administrators, and business writers. The results will assist them in determining the extent to which they will integrate computer-related composition activities into their business communication courses and offices. The study, which was conducted during fall semester, 1987, at the University of North Texas, used a posttest-only control group design, with a pretest to equate groups. It included 104 students enrolled in the introductory business communication course. Half of the students composed a business letter by hand and half did so <b>using</b> WordPerfect <b>word</b> processing software. The students' letters were then graded using a letter evaluation form containing 17 business writing quality categories. T-Tests were conducted to determine if significant differences existed at the. 05 level in the 17 quality categories when: (1) handwritten letters were compared to those composed <b>using</b> <b>word</b> processing; (2) letters composed by students <b>using</b> <b>word</b> processing with previous word processing experience were compared to letters composed by students <b>using</b> <b>word</b> processing with no previous word processing experience; (3) letters composed by students <b>using</b> <b>word</b> processing with previous word processing experience were compared to handwritten letters; and (4) letters composed by students <b>using</b> <b>word</b> processing with no previous word processing experience were compared to handwritten letters.

25|$|The {{specificity}} of bird calls {{has been used}} extensively for species identification. The calls of birds have been described <b>using</b> <b>words</b> or nonsense syllables or line diagrams. Common terms in English include words such as quack, chirp and chirrup. These are subject to imagination and vary greatly; a well-known example is the white-throated sparrow's song, given in Canada as O sweet Canada Canada Canada and in New England as Old Sam Peabody Peabody Peabody (also Where are you Frederick Frederick Frederick?). In addition to nonsense words, grammatically correct phrases have been constructed as likenesses of the vocalizations of birds. For example, the barred owl produces a motif which some bird guides describe as Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you all? with the emphasis placed on you.|$|E
25|$|While {{many species}} communicate, {{language}} {{is unique to}} humans, {{a defining feature of}} humanity, and a cultural universal. Unlike the limited systems of other animals, human language is open—an infinite number of meanings can be produced by combining a limited number of symbols. Human language also has the capacity of displacement, <b>using</b> <b>words</b> to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring, but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors. Language differs from other forms of communication in that it is modality independent; the same meanings can be conveyed through different media, auditively in speech, visually by sign language or writing, and even through tactile media such as braille. Language is central to the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups. The invention of writing systems at least five thousand years ago allowed the preservation of language on material objects, and was a major technological advancement. The science of linguistics describes the structure and function of language and the relationship between languages. There are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including sign languages, and many thousands more that are extinct.|$|E
