40|$|AbstractLANS with {{confidential}} information are always being separated physically from internet to avoid hacker's attack, Trojan and virus. It is in high security, but also difficult to exchange among different security levels of networks synchronously. A new unilateral transmission {{system based on}} multiple channels & 2 D Code encoding and decoding technology has been put forward. The system uses light as the transmission carrier to insure its <b>unilateralization</b> from one network to others. Transmission speed reaches 10 KB/S. It is not costly, but being manipulated conveniently. In a word, the system is in high security and utility...|$|E
40|$|Pulse oximeters are {{ubiquitous}} in modern medicine to noninvasively measure {{the percentage of}} oxygenated hemoglobin in a patient's blood by comparing the transmission characteristics of red and infrared light-emitting diode light through the patient's finger with a photoreceptor. We present an analog single-chip pulse oximeter with 4. 8 -mW total power dissipation, which is {{an order of magnitude}} below our measurements on commercial implementations. The majority of this power reduction is due to the use of a novel logarithmic transimpedance amplifier with inherent contrast sensitivity, distributed amplification, <b>unilateralization,</b> and automatic loop gain control. The transimpedance amplifier, together with a photodiode current source, form a high-performance photoreceptor with characteristics similar to those found in nature, which allows LED power to be reduced. Therefore, our oximeter is well suited for portable medical applications, such as continuous home-care monitoring for elderly or chronic patients, emergency patient transport, remote soldier monitoring, and wireless medical sensing. Furthermore, our design obviates the need for an A-to-D and digital signal processor and leads to a small single-chip solution. We outline how extensions of our work could lead to submilliwatt oximeters...|$|E
40|$|SummaryPurposeTo {{assess whether}} paired pulse {{magnetic}} motor evoked potential (MEP) can predict surgical {{prognosis in patients}} with intractable epilepsy. MethodsMEP of the unilateral hand muscles were recorded following paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex. The interstimulus intervals of paired stimulation were 1 – 16 ms with a conditioning stimulus that was 90 % active motor threshold. Subjects were six patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) scheduled for anterior temporal lobectomy and three patients with myoclonic or head-drop seizures scheduled for anterior corpus callosotomy, resulting in the <b>unilateralization</b> of epileptic discharges. The hemisphere showing unilateral discharges {{was defined as the}} affected hemisphere. The intracortical inhibition and facilitation curve was drawn based on MEP before and after surgery and the relationship between MEP and surgical prognosis was investigated. ResultsIn five patients with TLE showing class I surgical results (Engel's classification), the affected hemisphere showing cortical hyperexcitability preoperatively was almost normalized after surgery. However, in a patient with class III, the unaffected hemisphere showed cortical hyperexcitability before and after surgery. In the callosotomy group, two patients with excellent outcomes showed the same results as TLE group with class I. ConclusionsPaired pulse magnetic MEP may provide predictive value in terms of surgical outcome in those patients with intractable epilepsy...|$|E
40|$|Pulse oximetry is a fast, noninvasive, easy-to-use, and {{continuous}} method for monitoring the oxygen saturation of a patient's blood. In modem medical practice, blood oxygen level {{is considered one}} of the important vital signs of the body. The pulse oximeter system consists of an optoelectronic sensor that is normally placed on the subject's finger and a signal processing unit that computes the oxygen saturation. It uses red and infrared LEDs to illuminate the subject's finger. We present an advanced logarithmic photoreceptor which takes advantage of techniques such as distributed (cascaded) amplification, automatic loop gain control, and parasitic capacitance <b>unilateralization</b> to improve the performance and ameliorate certain shortcomings of existing logarithmic photoreceptors. These improvements allow us to reduce LED power significantly because of a more sensitive photoreceptor. Furthermore, the exploitation of the logarithmic nonlinearity inherent in transistors eliminates the need of performing some of the mathematical operations which are traditionally done in digital domain to calculate oxygen saturation and allows for a very area-efficient all-analog implementation. The need for an ADC and a DSP is thus completely eliminated. (cont.) We show that our analog pulse oximeter constructed with red and infrared LEDs and our novel photoreceptor at its front end consumes 4. 8 mW of power whereas a custom-designed ASIC digital implementation (employing a conventional linear photoreceptor) and the best commercial pulse oximeter are estimated to dissipate 15. 7 mW and 55 mW, respectively. The direct result of such power efficiency is that while the batteries in this commercial oximeter need replacement every 5 days (assuming four "AAA" 1. 5 V batteries are used), our analog pulse oximeter allows 2 months of operation. Therefore, our oximeter is well suited for portable medical applications such as continuous home-care monitoring for elderly or chronic patients, emergency patient transport, remote soldier monitoring, and wireless medical sensing. by Maziar Tavakoli Dastjerdi.

40|$|While extramarital {{affairs and}} bao ernai have gained notoriety in Chinese society, the {{phenomena}} of xiaosan and ernai have been explosive in academic and legal spheres. Yet, these social phenomena among {{ethnic minority groups}} in China are unknown. This study {{is the first to}} explore the experiences of extramarital relations outside official marriage among the Hui ethnic group in China. The extramarital relations in the specific dual (Han/Hui) cultural context are interpreted and understood diversely due to the interplay among a host of conditioning factors –interests, beliefs, norms, legal codes, moral sanctions. By using the snowball sampling method, this study has deployed in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 41 Hui men and women living in either the capital or in a the small town oin Qinghai Province in western China. This thesis examines the way in which Islamic religious values are played out in the context of Chinese law and extramarital relations. It also examines why, given the Hui knowledge of their religious and ethnic position, the Hui engage in extramarital affairs outside official marriage. Thus, it seeks to understand the Hui with respect to their intimacy and sexual relations both within and outside official marriage in contemporary China. This study argues that, in the local context, the Hui preserve their religious beliefs and Islamic values to differentiate themselves from other ethnic groups. Islam is a key marker of their ethnicity, functioning as religious law to culturally validate their behavior. Local knowledge of legal pluralism enables the Hui to act defiantly, despite the state’s disapproval of their practices of extramarital intimacy and sex. The interaction between the state and customary law is under the unilateral control of the state. Instead of coexisting, this legal <b>unilateralization</b> shows that customary law usually gives way to state law wherever they intersect. As a result, the interplay of the two legal cultures – that of the Chinese state and that of Islam – produces crime, but also makes extramarital relationships in the Hui context possible. I argue that Islamic beliefs cannot fully explain the individualism and subjectivity of Muslims in the context of extramarital practices, especially within a transforming China and a globalizing economy. The Hui articulate and negotiate their multiple affective, sexual, and material desires to raise their self-awareness of aspirations and construe their autonomy and self-representation in order to justify their behavior. Individual desires also play a pivotal role in interpreting their practices, and are in turn played out in the intersection of intimacy, gender, ethnicity, social status, and age. The interplay of ethnicity and desires helps us to better understand these experiences in a cultural context that includes increased ethnic consciousness among the Hui and the emergence of varied desires among them within desiring China. published_or_final_versionSociologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
