In 1841 John Phillips published the first global geologic time scale based on the types of fossils found in each era.

25|$|The {{doctrine}} of foreign equivalents is a {{rule applied in}} United States trademark law which requires courts and the TTAB to translate foreign words in determining whether they are registrable as trademarks, or confusingly similar with existing marks. The doctrine is intended to protect consumers within the United States from confusion or deception caused by the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> in different languages. In some cases, a party will use a word as a mark which is either generic or merely descriptive of the goods in a foreign language, or which shares the same meaning as an existing mark to speakers of that foreign language.|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} of adoption is changing and evolving, {{and since the}} 1970s has been a controversial issue tied closely to adoption reform efforts. The controversy arises over the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> which, while designed to be more appealing or less offensive to some persons affected by adoption, may simultaneously cause offense or insult to others. This controversy illustrates the problems in adoption, {{as well as the}} fact that coining new words and phrases to describe ancient social practices will not necessarily alter the feelings and experiences of those affected by them. Two of the contrasting sets of terms are commonly referred to as positive adoption language (PAL) (sometimes called respectful adoption language (RAL)), and honest adoption language (HAL).|$|E
25|$|All {{nations in}} North and South America have populations of {{indigenous}} peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly Latin American), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population—in Bolivia they account for an estimated 56–70% of the total nation, and {{at least half of}} the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as Native Americans, Amerindians, and American Indians. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries one finds the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> such as pueblos , amerindios, povos nativos, povos indígenas, and in Peru, Comunidades Nativas (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the Urarina and Matsés. In Chile there are indigenous tribes like the Mapuches in the Center-South and the Aymaras in the North, also the Rapa Nui indigenous to Easter Island are a Polynesian tribe.|$|E

500|$|A {{court may}} thus award sole legal {{custody of the}} {{children}} to one of the parents, but with joint physical custody to both parents. In many states, a parent with sole physical custody {{is referred to as the}} custodial parent, and the other parent is referred to as the non-custodial parent. With joint physical custody, a court's <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> such as [...] "primary custodial parent" [...] and [...] "primary residence" [...] may not have much significance beyond being part of the court's division of child tax exemptions between the parents, as both parents are custodial parents.|$|E
500|$|According to Lillian Faderman, [...] "There was {{probably}} no lesbian {{in the four}} decades between 1928 and the late 1960s capable of reading English {{or any of the}} eleven languages into which the book was translated who was unfamiliar with The Well of Loneliness." [...] Although the novel's author, Radclyffe Hall, intended it as an argument for greater tolerance for what she called [...] "sexual inverts", it has often been criticized by lesbian readers for its protagonist's self-hatred and its <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> like [...] "freak" [...] and [...] "mistake of nature". Barney, as the salon hostess Valérie Seymour, appears in the novel as the symbol of a different attitude.

500|$|The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> {{and images}} {{referring}} to Native Americans/First Nations {{as the name}} or mascot for a sports team is a topic of public controversy in the United States and Canada. Since the 1960s, {{as part of the}} indigenous civil rights movements, {{there have been a number}} of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters targeting the more prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the Cleveland Indians (in particular their [...] "Chief Wahoo" [...] logo); and the Washington Redskins (the term [...] "redskins" [...] being defined in most American English dictionaries as 'derogatory slang'). Despite the visibility of these national protests with no resolution, change has occurred locally in the trend by school and college teams retiring Native American names and mascots at an increasing rate since the 1970s.|$|E

500|$|Native American {{writer and}} {{attorney}} Gyasi Ross compares Native American use of {{variations of the}} word [...] "redskin" [...] with African-American use of variations of the word [...] "nigger"; specifically Natives calling each other [...] "skins" [...] as analogous to [...] "nigga". The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> by some members of minority communities {{does not mean that}} the same may be used by outsiders; this is generally recognized by white people with regard to black expressions, yet whites feel free to say how Natives should feel about [...] "redskin". Ross also notes that there is no consensus among Natives regarding either opposition to the Washington team's use of the name, or the importance of the issue compared to more immediate concerns. In answer to the argument that Native Americans ought to focus on social issues larger than a team name, Ross stated that [...] "Native people shouldn't be forced to choose between living or racial discrimination. Those are false binaries." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 4, 2009 a [...] {{alligator}} gar {{was found}} in Tak Wah Park in Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong. Over the next two days, at least 16 other alligator gar, [...] the largest measuring , were found in ponds in public parks in Hong Kong. Nearby residents reported the alligator gar had been released into the ponds by aquarium hobbyists, and had lived there for several years. [...] However, after a complaint made by a citizen who falsely identified alligator gar as crocodiles, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> like [...] "horrible man-eating fish" [...] had begun appearing in the headlines of some major local newspapers. [...] Officials with Leisure and Cultural Services in Tak Wah Park removed all the alligator gar from the ponds because they were concerned the large, carnivorous fish might harm children. [...] It {{is not unusual for}} the large sharp teeth and outward appearance of alligator gar to precipitate unreasonable fear in those unfamiliar with the species. Sensationalized reports have contributed to the misconception of predatory attacks by alligator gar on humans even though none of the reports have been confirmed.|$|E

2500|$|The 5th-century Cantiorix Inscription now in Penmachno church {{seems to}} be the {{earliest}} record of the name.

2500|$|Similarly the Catholic Faith Handbook for Youth {{states that}} [...] "...not all Catholics are Roman Catholics {{and there are}} other Catholic Churches," [...] using the term [...] "Roman Catholic" [...] to refer to Western Church members alone.

That this view is not the only one, not alone {{at the level of the}} Holy See and in reference books such as , but also at a popular level, is shown by the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> such as [...] "Byzantine Roman Catholic" [...] and [...] "Maronite Roman Catholic" [...] as self-identification by individuals or as the name of a church building.

Inconsistencies were also found for the impact of experience on situation awareness. The effects of workload and perceptual conditions were consistent between this and other empirical studies.
