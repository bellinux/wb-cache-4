5|$|In 1978, when Vietnamese leaders {{launched}} their invasion of Kampuchea {{to remove the}} Khmer Rouge regime, they did not expect a negative reaction from the international community. However, the events that followed the invasion showed that Vietnamese leaders had severely miscalculated international sympathies towards their cause. Instead of backing Vietnam, most United Nations member countries denounced the Vietnamese <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>against</b> Kampuchea, and even moved to revive the battered Khmer Rouge organisation that had once governed the country with such brutality. Thus, {{more than just a}} military problem, Kampuchea quickly evolved into an economic and diplomatic problem for Vietnam on the international arena. Throughout the decade in which Vietnam occupied neighbouring Kampuchea, the Vietnamese Government, and the PRK regime which it installed, were placed {{on the periphery of the}} international community.|$|E

25|$|There {{were several}} major {{violations}} {{described in the}} ICRC report.

25|$|He {{stood for}} {{unqualified}} Swaraj (self-governance), including the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>against</b> the British. This meant {{a confrontation with}} Mohandas Gandhi, who in fact opposed Bose's presidency, splitting the Indian National Congress party. Bose attempted to maintain unity, but Gandhi advised Bose to form his own cabinet. The rift also divided Bose and Nehru. Bose appeared at the 1939 Congress meeting on a stretcher. He was elected president again over Gandhi's preferred candidate Pattabhi Sitaramayya. U. Muthuramalingam Thevar strongly supported Bose in the intra-Congress dispute. Thevar mobilised all south India votes for Bose. However, due to the manoeuvrings of the Gandhi-led clique in the Congress Working Committee, Bose found himself forced to resign from the Congress presidency.|$|E

25|$|Police {{brutality}} in Slovakia is {{systematic and}} widely documented, but is almost exclusively brought about against the Romani minority. The nation state itself has particularly racist {{attitudes toward the}} Romani minority, dating back prior to the split of Czechoslovakia. In fact, it is widely known that the government undertook, and still undertakes forced sterilisation of Romani women, and continues to segregate the Romani into walled-off settlements. This discrimination has undoubtedly filtered down to the police force. Excessive <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>against</b> the Romani minority by police has been publicly criticised by the United Nations. The police force has been repeatedly condemned {{by a number of}} organisations for lengthy pre-trial detention, and its treatment of suspects in custody.|$|E

25|$|Following the UN {{authorized}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>against</b> Iraq, the Canadian Forces deployed a CF-18 Hornet and Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King squadron {{with support}} personnel, {{as well as}} a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war.

The only CF-18 Hornet to record an official victory during the conflict was an aircraft involved in the beginning of the Battle of Bubiyan against the Iraqi Navy. A Canadian combat engineer regiment was investigated following the release of 1991 photographs which showed members posing with the dismembered bodies in a Kuwaiti minefield.|$|E
