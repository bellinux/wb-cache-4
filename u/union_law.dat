Intervention by member countries in their agricultural sectors poses an obstacle to free trade in European countries, which EU legislation, among other things, attempts to address.|$|E

In 1987 Malvern gained official EU status as a natural mineral water, a mark of purity and quality. However, in spite of regular quality analysis, Malvern's reputation for purity suffered a blow when the rock that filters the water dried out during 2006, allowing the water from heavy storms to flow through it too quickly for the natural filtering process to take place efficiently. Due to the slight impurities, the Coca-Cola Company, manufacturer of the Schweppes brand, had to install filtration equipment, which reclassifies the water as spring water under European <b>Union</b> <b>law.</b> Consequently, the labels were change from: Malvern The Original English Natural Mineral Water.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to find out if the country level differences in legal protection of investors and workers have an effect on (1) the likelihood of worker layoffs, (2) the stock market reactions to layoff announcements, and (3) operating performance following layoffs. Furthermore, objective is to study how firm-specific characteristics affect the observed results. The sample countries studied in this paper show either strong investor protection combined with weak <b>union</b> <b>laws,</b> or weak investor protection combined with strong <b>union</b> <b>laws.</b> The sample consists of manufacturing companies from six countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The accounting-based data consists of 421 firm-years at the onset of a sudden and sharp deterioration in operating performance over the period 2003 to 2009, and is used in measuring the likelihood of layoffs and operating performance following the distress year. The primary source of the accounting-based data is Worldscope. To investigate the valuation impacts, a sample of 112 layoff announcements (in English language) over the period 2003 to 2009 is collected from Lexis-Nexis. The source of the equity prices is Datastream. The results confirm that the likelihood of large-scale layoffs is lower when investor protection is weak and <b>union</b> <b>laws</b> are strong, implying that managers base layoff decisions on the relative influence of investors and workers in order to protect their own jobs. The preventive effect of strong <b>union</b> <b>laws</b> on layoff decisions is less powerful when financial leverage is high. Controlling for firm-specific characteristics, the average share price reaction on layoff announcements is less negative when <b>union</b> <b>laws</b> are strong, indicating that the market interprets layoffs of these companies as a signal that managers are siding with investors, which however, does not carry the economic importance to outweigh the bad news about declining demand. Layoffs improve employee productivity, measured by sales per employee, only when weak investor protection and strong <b>union</b> <b>laws</b> prevail. I interpret that the inefficiencies associated with unions are being diminished in these individual companies. However, layoffs lead to no improvements in profitability, measured by EBITDA to total assets, that is weighed down by restructuring costs...|$|R
