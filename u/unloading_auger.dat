The device was used to unload grain from farm combines. The company's controlling stake was sold to Italian corporation Fiat Trattori in 1977. The remainder of the company was purchased in 1987 by the same firm. [...] In 1991, a year after being established, AGCO Corporation purchased the rights to Hesston Manufacturing.|$|E
40|$|To {{facilitate}} 2 ̆ 2 unloading on-the-go 2 ̆ 2, {{a sensor}} package mounted to a combine harvester {{to allow for}} automatic <b>unloading</b> <b>auger</b> control was desired. A rotating array of four ultrasonic sensors was chosen over cameras because of dusty operating conditions and poor lighting. Static testing {{was done with the}} ultrasonic sensor package mounted on the combine harvester <b>unloading</b> <b>auger</b> viewing a wagon load of corn. A feature extraction process was devised which correctly segmented and identified wagon edges from the grain contained in the wagon. Once features were identified, a second order polynomial surface was fitted to the grain to extrapolate the grain surface. The grain fill level was then calculated. With this information, the <b>unloading</b> <b>auger</b> could be automatically turned off and its swing could be automatically controlled to avoid wagon edges and to fill the wagon evenly with grain...|$|E
40|$|Not all {{corn and}} {{soybeans}} are produced as bulk commodities. Some end-use customers such as processors of low-linolenic soybean oil, organic growers, and seed producers desire products with extremely low amounts or no commingled grain from other varieties or crops. Multiple sources of contamination from residual grain within on-farm equipment are possible, but the combine has the greatest number and size of cavities to harbor grain even after the <b>unloading</b> <b>auger</b> has emptied the grain tank...|$|E
5000|$|The cross auger {{is smaller}} than the main <b>unload</b> <b>auger,</b> which allows the <b>unload</b> <b>auger</b> to expel the grain at a {{constant}} rate. The bins can also feature cross auger cut-offs, which allow the operator to choke the feed rate to the <b>unload</b> <b>auger</b> if it starts struggling. Unload augers can empty a full bin {{in a matter of}} minutes, with 15" [...] augers unloading at a rate of 6T per minute, and 19" [...] augers unloading at 10T per minute.|$|R

In this study, a combine robot was equipped with an autonomous grain container searching function. In order to realize automated grain unloading, the combine robot has to search and identify the grain storage container in an outdoor environment. A planar board {{was attached to the}} container. The marker was searched for using a camera mounted on the <b>unloading</b> <b>auger</b> of the combine. An efficient marker searching procedure was proposed {{on the basis of a}} numerical analysis of the camera's field of view and was verified experimentally. The results showed that the combine robot efficiently searched for and detected the marker and positioned its spout at the target point over the container to unload the grain...|$|E
40|$|In the past, {{optimizing}} {{the efficiency}} of crop production focused on one single machine. Today, machine manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s focus has shifted to optimizing {{the performance of a}} complete field operation through coordinated machine operations. The focus of this project was on the harvest operation, where resource usage is typically the highest. With modern grain harvest systems, combine operators often unload grain while continuing to harvest crop (unloading-on-the-go). In order to achieve this, the combine operator must coordinate machine speed and placement with the grain cart operator for accurate placement of grain into the cart. The combine operator manages on/off control of the <b>unloading</b> <b>auger</b> with in-cab controls as the well as the placement of the grain by changing the speed of the combine relative to the cart. This project developed an autonomous machine positioning system that controlled the relative position of a combine to a grain cart during unloading-on-the-go. This was achieved by developing a control model which made small adjustments to the ground speed of the combine to achieve relative position shifts. The control system was able to consistently achieve the desired accuracy of ÃÂ± 40 cm while limiting the differential engine loading due to position shifts to less than 10...|$|E
40|$|Emerging identity-preserved grain markets {{depend on}} {{avoidance}} of commingling grain at harvest. Knowledge of where grain resides in a combine, cleaning labor requirements, and resulting purity levels would assist producers. Measurements {{were made of}} grain and other material residing in different areas of rotary- and cylinder-type combines in replicated clean-outs during corn and soybean harvest and also in preliminary clean-outs during oat harvest. Concentration of the prior (i. e. commingled) grain was measured in the first grain harvested of the subsequent crop. Total material remaining in the combine ranged from 84 to 186 lb, 61 % of which was whole grain. The greatest amounts of corn and soybean material (17 to 74 lb) {{were found in the}} grain tank and rock trap. Intermediate amounts were found in the head or feederhouse, elevators, and at times the cylinder/rotor (soybeans), the <b>unloading</b> <b>auger</b> (soybeans, oats), and rear axle/chopper area. The least amounts were found in the cleaning shoe and straw walkers (cylinder-type machine). Time spent to clean the combine varied from about two hours to seven hours. Cleaning the head, grain tank, threshing rotor/cylinder, and cleaning shoe required more time than other areas. Immediately after cleaning, small amounts of prior (commingled) grain and foreign material, 0. 2 to 2. 5 lb, were found in the first bushel of subsequent grain harvested. Following clean-outs, commingled grain levels dropped below 0. 5 % after 20 bu were harvested. Over 14 lb of wheat were found during the first clean-out of a combine following 50 ac of oat harvest (no physical clean-out prior to oat harvest) ...|$|E
40|$|Previous static bed {{ozonation}} scale-up {{and demonstration}} trials have proven {{the use of}} ozone as an effective technology for grain protection without affecting its end-use quality. Due {{to the lack of}} current availability of high capacity ozone producing generators, grain treatment through static bed ozonation systems are limited to be used in metal silos of capacities smaller than 644 -t. Also, the trials have shown that treatment time has to be of no less than 4 d during application in order to be effective for pest control. Therefore, more efficient ozonation treatment systems are needed for proper ozone usage for stored product protection. The primary objective of these research studies was to design and test a semicontinuous counter-flow ozonation and a continuous ozonation flow treatment systems in order to ozonate grain at faster rates based on the concentration-time product (CTP) of ozone required to achieve 100 % insect mortality and effective mold reduction in grain. The procedure of the counter-flow semicontinuous ozonation system consisted of removing each grain layer inside a metal silo with a tapered <b>unloading</b> <b>auger</b> after each layer reached the desired ozone CTP. The treated grain is subsequently transported to a storage or shipping silo. The continuous ozonation flow system involves applying high ozone concentrations through a modified grain loading screw conveyor where ozone and grain are moving continuously in the same flow direction. The counter-flow semi-continuous ozonation system was successfully tested and proved to be a technically feasible tool for pest control and mold reduction. The continuous ozonation flow system was proved as an effective tool for treating grain during handling while achieving 100 % insect mortality, and effective mold reduction...|$|E

(Young Scholars) Effects of feed truck {{unloading}} and swine barn {{feed line}} location on pellet quality and nutrient segregation. Journal of Animal Science, 94, 78 - 78. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 166 Two experiments were conducted at a commercial feed mill and 6 commercial wean to finish pig sites {{to determine the}} effects of feed truck <b>unloading</b> <b>auger</b> RPM on pellet quality and unloading time, and the effects of feed line location on pellet quality and nutrient concentration of intact pellets and their fines. In Exp. 1, pelleted feed was unloaded using 3 speeds (900, 1150, and 1400 RPM) from each of 8 compartments of a feed truck (Walinga Inc., Guelph, ON, Canada). Six samples per compartment were collected creating 16 replications/unloading speed. There was an unloading speed × trailer compartment interaction (P = 0. 031; SEM = 17. 4). The difference in unloading time from the front to rear compartment was greatest at the slowest unloading speed and similar at the 2 highest unloading speeds (70 vs. 35 and 37 s). The percentage of fines formed during unloading was not influenced by unloading speed, but tended to increase (quadratic; P = 0. 081; SEM = 2. 27) from the front (8. 2 %) to the rear compartment (10. 7 %). In Exp. 2, pelleted feed samples were collected during unloading into a commercial feed bin at 6 finishing pig sites with 2 feed lines, resulting in 12 replications per feed line location. Samples were collected from the feed line at 6, 35, and 76 m from the feed bin. There were no interactions between feed line location and nutrient profile of the fines and pellets. There was no effect of feed line location on pellet durability index, percentage fines, percentage fines formed, or the nutrient profile of pellets or fines. Across locations, fines had decreased (P < 0. 05) CP (12. 4 vs. 15. 3 %; SEM = 0. 14) and P (0. 37 vs. 0. 40 %; SEM = 0. 006), but greater (P < 0. 05) ADF (3. 7 vs. 3. 2 %; SEM = 0. 24), crude fiber (2. 7 vs. 2. 2 %; SEM = 0. 09), Ca (0. 47 vs. 0. 44 %; SEM = 0. 012), ether extract (6. 2 vs. 5. 2 %; SEM = 0. 11), and starch (47. 4 vs. 44. 7 %; SEM = 0. 42) for the fines and pellets, respectively. In conclusion, the front compartments closer to the truck cab resulted in fewer fines formed from loading to unloading. Decreasing unloading speed significantly increased the amount of time taken to unload a feed truck but did not alter fines formed. Feeder distance from the bin did not influence fines formation. There were significant differences in nutrient profile between fines and pellets. Understanding the location of fines creation during the feed delivery process may allow for alternative methods to reduce the formation of fines and subsequent nutrient segregation...|$|E
