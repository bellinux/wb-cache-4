5|$|Kisnorbo's {{season was}} ended on 2 January when he {{sustained}} a serious knee injury in Leeds' 2–1 win over Burnley.

5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E
5|$|By 1472, {{at the age}} of twenty, Leonardo {{qualified}} as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke, the guild of artists and doctors of medicine, but even after his father set him <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate with him. Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a drawing in pen and ink of the Arno valley, drawn on 5 August 1473.|$|E

He was able to show it to Avnet, who was so {{impressed}} that he spent two years working with him on his screenplay. No major studio was interested in Sky Captain, but Avnet convinced Aurelio De Laurentiis to finance Sky Captain without a distribution deal.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, when Bauer {{again was}} asked to {{illustrate}} the book, {{he made it clear}} to the publisher that he wanted to retain his pictures along with the copyrights after publication. The publishing house had kept the original illustrations for the previous editions and considered them their property. Bauer was backed <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> request by other artists facing the same problem. The publishers did not budge from their position and without Bauer's illustrations, book sales dropped.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{stressed}} {{that he would}} act as the trustee of the princes' commitment, as he would be serving as India's head of state well into 1948. He engaged in a personal dialogue with reluctant princes, such as the Nawab of Bhopal, who he asked through a confidential letter to sign the Instrument of Accession making Bhopal part of India, which Mountbatten would keep locked <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> safe. It would be handed to the States Department on 15 August only if the Nawab did not change his mind before then, which {{he was free to}} do. The Nawab agreed, and did not renege over the deal.|$|E

5|$|Other {{witnesses}} for {{the plaintiffs}} included a former maid of Brownlee's, who testified {{that she had seen}} the premier pick MacMillan <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car late one night, and MacMillan's landlady's daughter, who testified that she found MacMillan sobbing in her room one night. Allan MacMillan was also called: though he testified that Brownlee had encouraged his daughter to move to Edmonton and promised to forward information about Alberta College, he acknowledged that the premier had not followed through and not contacted her again until she was in Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} set in a fictional kingdom where both magic and early 20th century {{technology}} are prevalent, against the backdrop of a war with another kingdom. The film {{tells the story of a}} young hatter named Sophie after she is turned into an old woman by a witch's curse. She encounters a wizard named Howl, and gets caught <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> resistance to fighting for the king.|$|E
5|$|During the party, Tony Yayo enters {{another room}} of the mansion and removes a {{painting}} {{from one of the}} walls, revealing a hidden safe: after opening it and removing a silver necklace, a woman (Buffie Carruth) who has followed him from the party enters the room and the pair begin to embrace. At this point, the police suddenly enter the room, searching for Tony Yayo, although it is shown that he has escaped just in time through an open door in the room. Reunited in the Mercedes-Benz with 50 Cent, Tony Yayo gives the necklace to 50 Cent: at this point, Tony Yayo abruptly wakes <b>up,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> jail cell, showing the preceding events of the video to have been a dream.|$|E

5|$|During their U.S. tours, the Beatles were {{introduced}} to both Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. Strongly influenced by Presley since before their formation, the band had tried to meet him in the past, but arrangements had fallen through. At Presley's suggestion, guitars were set <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> living room and the gathering played music for an hour, following which they discussed the music business and exchanged anecdotes. The other meeting, with Dylan, influenced the music subsequently produced by the Beatles as well as shaping Dylan's own musical style. This was made evident both in Dylan's controversial adoption of electric guitar, and in changes that were apparent in Lennon's vocal and guitar-playing styles.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, under Albery's management, John Gielgud staged Romeo and Juliet at the New Theatre, co-starring with Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans and Olivier. Gielgud {{had seen}} Olivier in Queen of Scots, spotted his potential, and now {{gave him a}} major step <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they {{exchanged}} roles. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running for 189 performances. Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare's verse, contrasting it with his co-star's mastery of the poetry. The friendship {{between the two men}} was prickly, on Olivier's side, {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Melissa calls Scully {{and tells}} her she is coming over. After {{receiving}} {{a call from}} someone who immediately hangs up, Scully leaves her apartment and tells Melissa that she'll head to her home instead. As she leaves, Skinner pulls <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car, telling her they need to speak in private. Melissa shows up soon afterwards and is mistakenly shot by Luis Cardinal, who is hiding there with Alex Krycek. Realizing they shot the wrong person, the two flee. Meanwhile, after taking Skinner to Mulder's apartment, Scully holds him at gunpoint, believing he is the traitor the Well-Manicured Man spoke of. Skinner tells Scully {{that he is in}} possession of the digital tape. Just then, someone steps outside the door. This distracts Scully enough for Skinner to pull his gun on her.|$|E

5|$|Peel {{worked with}} one of his weavers, James Hargreaves, to {{investigate}} new technologies. In 1762, Peel and Hargreaves set up a carding machine, but decided against using it. When Hargreaves went on to invent the spinning jenny in 1764, Peel was keen to use the technology. He set them <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> factory at Stanhill where Hargreaves worked. In the spring of 1768, the spinning jennies at Peel's factory were blamed for job losses. The factories and Hargreaves' nearby house were the targets of a riot, destroying the spinning jennies within– along with some of Peel's own inventions. In reaction, Peel moved his manufacturing away from Lancashire. He decided on Burton-upon-Trent where he built three mills, including cutting a canal for one.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin {{has written}} for the theatre, film and television, and in each medium his level of {{collaboration}} with other creators has varied. He began in theatre which involved a largely solitary writing process, then moved into film where he collaborated with director Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman, and eventually worked in television where he collaborated very closely with director Thomas Schlamme {{for nearly a decade}} on the shows Sports Night, The West Wing and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip; he now moves between all three media. He has a habit of chain smoking while he spends countless hours cooped <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> office plotting out his next scripts. He describes his writing process as physical because he will often stand up and speak the dialogue he is developing.|$|E
5|$|Teenager Billy Duncan wakes <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bed, {{seemingly}} disturbed, and learns {{his mother}} is leaving for vacation. He goes to visit his girlfriend Kathy, but her deranged grandfather Colonel Farley makes him leave before he can see her. As Billy drives around town, he is harassed by bullies Chuck Boran and Froggy, and by two police deputies who give him a speeding ticket. Billy wanders into the desert and discovers the laser cannon and pendant. He starts playing with the cannon, pretending to shoot things, then realizes he can fire the weapon while wearing the pendant. Meanwhile, on the alien spacecraft, the two aliens converse with their leader who shows them footage of Billy using the cannon, prompting the aliens to turn their ship around {{to head back to}} Earth. Context implies that the two aliens, upon departing Earth, left the cannon and pendant behind under the presumption that no other human would be able to use them as the green-skinned man had, but they have now learned that they were in error.|$|E

5|$|The Stone has {{suffered}} repeated desecrations and damage {{over the course}} of time. It {{is said to have been}} struck and smashed to pieces by a stone fired from a catapult during the Umayyad Caliphate's siege of Mecca in 683. The fragments were rejoined by Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr using a silver ligament. In January 930, it was stolen by the Qarmatians, who carried the Black Stone away to their base in Hajar (modern Eastern Arabia). According to Ottoman historian Qutb al-Din, writing in 1857, the Qarmatian leader Abu Tahir al-Jannabi set the Black Stone <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own mosque, the Masjid al-Dirar, with the intention of redirecting the hajj away from Mecca. However, this failed, and pilgrims continued to venerate the spot where the Black Stone had been.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Gielgud staged perhaps {{his most famous}} Shakespeare production, a Romeo and Juliet in which he co-starred with Ashcroft and Olivier.

For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they exchanged roles. As at Oxford, Ashcroft and Evans were Juliet and the nurse.

Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare's verse, comparing it with his co-star's mastery of the poetry.

5|$|Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) is Joel's brother. At {{the initial}} outbreak, he picked Joel and Sarah <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car {{to take them}} to safety. When the car is hit by a truck, he defends Joel as he carries Sarah, whose leg is badly hurt. After Sarah's death, Joel and Tommy {{initially}} survive together, but differing outlooks and Joel's hardened ways led to their estrangement, and Tommy left to join the Fireflies. After becoming disillusioned, he subsequently left them as well, and built a settlement around a working power plant in Wyoming with his wife, Maria. Many years later, Joel arrives at Tommy's settlement, and the brothers are reunited. Tommy initially refuses to take Ellie off Joel's hands, but upon seeing their close bond and realizing that Joel doesn't trust himself to protect Ellie, he agrees to take her to Marlene himself. However, Ellie confronts Joel about Sarah and, after having a change of heart, Joel and Ellie continue their journey after Tommy promises them sanctuary should they need it.|$|E
