25|$|Since {{the first}} {{settlement}} by the British in 1625, through history {{the economy of}} Barbados was primarily dependent on agriculture. It had been recorded that minus the marshes and gully regions, during the 1630s much of the desirable land had been deforested across the entire island. Quickly Barbados was then divided into large estate-plantations and using indentured labour mainly from the British Isles for the cultivation of tobacco and cotton crops were first introduced. The island, facing {{a large amount of}} competition from the North American colonies and the neighbouring West Indian islands, switched to the crop of sugar cane. Cultivation of sugar cane was quickly introduced by the exiled Jewish community which immigrated into Barbados from Dutch Brazil during the mid-17th century. The introduction of sugar cane became the single best move for the Barbados economy at the time, the economy boomed and Barbados had become populated with so many windmills that the island had the second highest density of windmills per square mile in the world, second only to the Netherlands. For about the next 100 years Barbados remained the richest of all the European colonies in the Caribbean region due to sugar. The prosperity in the colony of Barbados remained regionally unmatched <b>until</b> <b>sugar</b> cane production caught up in geographically larger countries such as Jamaica and elsewhere. Despite being eclipsed by larger makers of sugar, Barbados continued to produce the crop well into the 20th century and to this day.|$|E

50|$|Allen {{believed}} that previous diabetic treatments had been ineffective because {{they attempted to}} substitute fats for carbohydrates. This eventually led to acidosis, followed by coma and death. Only a starvation diet that limited the total caloric consumption would be effective. Allen found that a liquids-only diet could eliminate glycosuria and acidosis. The diabetic could then begin to eat gradually increasing diets, <b>until</b> <b>sugar</b> again began {{to show up in}} the urine. This test would allow him to determine how many calories a patient could safely consume.|$|E
50|$|Treacle is {{made from}} the syrup that remains after sugar is refined. Raw sugars are first treated in a process called affination. When dissolved, the {{resulting}} liquor contains the minimum of dissolved non-sugars to be removed by treatment with activated carbon or bone char. The dark-coloured washings are treated separately, without carbon or bone char. They are boiled to grain (i.e. <b>until</b> <b>sugar</b> crystals precipitate out) in a vacuum pan, forming a low-grade massecuite (boiled mass) which is centrifuged, yielding a brown sugar and a liquid by-product—treacle.|$|E
50|$|The Meskwaki use a {{decoction}} of {{the inner}} bark as an emetic, and the Ojibwa use an infusion {{of the inner}} bark for the same purpose. The Chiricahua and Mescalero Apache dry scrapings of the inner bark and keep it as winter food, and they also boil the inner bark <b>until</b> <b>sugar</b> crystallizes out of it. The Dakota also use the sap to make sugar, as do the Omaha, the Pawnee, the Ponca, the Winnebago, and the indigenous people of Montana, who also freeze the sap {{and use it as}} a syrup The Ojibwa mix the sap with that of the sugar maple and drink it as a beverage.|$|E

50|$|Near Pleasant Garden, US 421 {{transitions}} from an expressway to a freeway by overlapping with I-85; it also goes west {{from this point}} <b>until</b> <b>Sugar</b> Grove. As the modern eight-lane I-85/US 421 overlap loops south of Greensboro, it soon connects with I-73 and switches to overlap it. Another 6 mi later, it switches again to I-40 and continues on towards Winston-Salem. Near Kernersville, US 421 switches one last time with Business Loop I-40 going into downtown Winston-Salem. The freeway section through Winston-Salem is the oldest in the Triad and will typically have some construction for either road or bridge repair; people can bypass the downtown area by staying on I-40 then taking exit 188, where US 421 meets up again.|$|E
5000|$|The great {{demand for}} sugar in Europe and the {{resulting}} ever increasing need for plantation workers led to the near extinction of the natives and made sugar production dependent on African slaves. Current estimates are that between 1500 and 1850, some 20 million people were forcibly transported to the Americas. Exhibits in the Sklavenwirtschaft / Plantagenwirtschaft (Slave trade / Plantation trade) section of the museum depict the inhumane conditions on slave ships and give glimpses {{into the lives of}} the workers in the New World. The European demand for sugar was so great, however, {{and the resulting}} wealth of the [...] "West India interest" [...] so influential, that despite the boycott efforts of the 'Anti-Sacharrites', not <b>until</b> <b>sugar</b> could be made from sugar beets did antislavery advocates prevail, as for example they did in England in 1807 {{with the passage of the}} Slave Trade Act.|$|E

50|$|During {{the colonial}} period, {{the arrival of}} sugar culture deeply {{impacted}} the society and economy in the Caribbean. It not only dramatically increased the ratio of slaves to free men, but it increased the average size of slave plantations. Early sugar plantations made extensive use of slaves because sugar was considered a cash crop that exhibited economies of scale in cultivation; it was most efficiently grown on large plantations with many workers. As a result, {{black men and women}} were forcibly taken from Africa and made into slaves to work on the plantations. For example, before 1650 more than three-quarters of the islands' population was white. In 1680, the median size of a plantation in Barbados had increased to about 60 slaves. Over the decades, the sugar plantations became larger and larger. In 1832, the median-size plantation in Jamaica had about 150 slaves, and nearly one of every four bondsmen lived on units that had at least 250 slaves.For about 100 years, Barbados remained the richest of all the European colonies in the Caribbean. The colony's prosperity remained regionally unmatched <b>until</b> <b>sugar</b> cane production expanded in larger countries, such as Saint Domingue and Jamaica. As part of the mass sugar industry, sugar cane processing gave rise to related commodities such as rum, molasses, and falernum.|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{biological}} carbon (bio-char) on soil microbial community were studied by pot experiments simulating long residual herbicide residues in soil environment, which clarifed {{the improvement of}} biochar and its structural properties on soil microenvironment. The results showed that fungi and actinomycetes had the same effect tendency within 0 ~ 0. 72 mg·kg- 1 in clomazone residue which increased the role of stimulation with crop growth process prolonged, especially in high residue treatment, but strong inhibitory effect on bacteria community was occured early which returned to normal <b>until</b> <b>sugar</b> beet growth to fiftieth day. Soil fungi community decreased with bio-char adding, but had no significant difference with the control. When clomazone residue in soil was below 0. 24 mg·kg- 1, soil actinomycetes community was higher than control without bio-char, bacteria increased first and then reduced after adding carbon as below 0. 12 mg·kg- 1. Biochar was ‘deep hole’ structure containing C, O, S and other elements. The results showed that a certain concentration clomazone residue in soil would stimulate soil fungi and actinomycetes to grow. After adding the biochar, the inhibition effect of high herbicides residual on bacterial would be alleviated...|$|E
