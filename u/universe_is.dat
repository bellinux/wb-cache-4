5|$|Dark {{matter is}} the matter in the {{universe}} that cannot be seen. Because of the gravitational effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the matter in the <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> dark matter. The spatial distribution of dark matter in the <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists answer to this question.|$|E
5|$|The {{observable}} <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> isotropic on scales significantly {{larger than}} superclusters, {{meaning that the}} statistical properties of the Universe are the same in all directions as observed from Earth. The <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> bathed in highly isotropic microwave radiation that corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly 2.72548 kelvin. The hypothesis that the large-scale <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> homogeneous and isotropic {{is known as the}} cosmological principle. A Universe that is both homogeneous and isotropic looks the same from all vantage points and has no center.|$|E

5|$|Because {{we cannot}} observe space beyond {{the edge of}} the {{observable}} universe, it is unknown whether the size of the <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> finite or infinite.|$|E
5|$|The Big Bang theory {{depends on}} two major assumptions: the {{universality}} of physical laws and the cosmological principle. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> homogeneous and isotropic.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> all {{of space}} and time (spacetime) and its contents, which {{includes}} planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space and all matter and energy. While the size of the entire <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> still unknown, it is possible to measure the observable universe. Halpern and Tomasello calculated the observable universe using data from European Space Agency's Planck satellite, estimating it to be 90.68 billion light-years across, 0.7% smaller then previously thought.|$|E

5|$|The cosmic {{abundance}} of vanadium in the <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> 0.0001%, making the element nearly {{as common as}} copper or zinc. Vanadium is detected spectroscopically in light from the Sun and sometimes {{in the light from}} other stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} 4.9% of the mass–energy of the <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> ordinary matter, that is, atoms, ions, {{electrons and}} the objects they form. This matter includes stars, which produce {{nearly all of}} the light we see from galaxies, as well as interstellar gas in the interstellar and intergalactic media, planets, and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, touch or squeeze. As a matter of fact, the great majority of ordinary matter in the <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 per cent of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> {{somewhat}} {{difficult to}} define. According to a restrictive definition, the <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> everything within our connected spacetime that could {{have a chance to}} interact with us and vice versa. According to the general theory of relativity, some regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.|$|E
5000|$|The Multiverse is the {{collection}} of alternate universes that share a universal hierarchy. A large variety of these <b>universes</b> <b>were</b> originated from another due to a major decision {{on the part of}} a character. Some can seem to be taking place in the past or future due to differences in how time passes in each universe. Often, new <b>universes</b> <b>are</b> born due to time traveling, another name for these new <b>universes</b> <b>is</b> an [...] "alternate timeline".Earth-616 is the established main universe where the majority of Marvel books take place.|$|R
5000|$|Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions was {{unveiled}} on March 30, 2010, where {{two of the}} universes, Amazing and Noir, were revealed. The third <b>universe,</b> 2099, <b>was</b> revealed on June 8, 2010. The final <b>universe,</b> Ultimate <b>was</b> first shown to players at San Diego Comic-Con 2010. Beenox made each universe feel unique by creating an individual art style for each universe and giving each Spider-Man different gameplay mechanics. For example, the Amazing and Ultimate <b>universes</b> <b>are</b> rendered with bright colors and tones of cel shading, the difference being that the Amazing <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> given a traditional comic feel based on those of 1960s classic comic book art styles, while the Ultimate <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> given a modern comic feel as of the early 2000s - onward comic book releases. In contrast, the Noir and 2099 <b>universes</b> <b>are</b> rendered with realistic graphics, with 2099 <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> given a futuristic feel while the Noir <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> given a [...] "very dark, very gritty" [...] feel. Noir Spider-Man uses stealth-based tactics on his enemies, similar to the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series, and 2099 Spider-Man uses free fall sequences. The developers also worked closely with Marvel Comics to create new versions of characters not seen before in a particular universe, such as Hobgoblin 2099, Hammerhead Noir, and Doctor Octopus 2099. The story for the game was written by Amazing Spider-Man writer Dan Slott and later provided him with an inspiration for the Spider-Verse comic book crossover event, which saw dozens of Spider-Men from alternate realities teaming up.|$|R
50|$|One {{can further}} {{show that the}} <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> radiation-dominated {{as long as the}} energy density was of the order of 10 eV to the fourth, or higher. Since the energy density keeps going down, this was no longer true when the <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> 70,000 years old, when it became matter dominant.|$|R
5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E
5|$|Ethnologists and anthropologists {{who study}} myths have {{developed}} various classification schemes {{for the various}} themes that appear in creation stories. For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the Universe. In another type of story, the <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> created from the union {{of male and female}} deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, the <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god— as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology– or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers, or the yin and yang of the Tao.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental to the {{structure}} of the <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> the existence of dark matter and dark energy. These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the Universe. For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen and helium are {{estimated}} to make up approximately 99 per cent of all ordinary matter in the universe. Less than five per cent of the <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> believed {{to be made of}} ordinary matter, represented by stars, planets and living beings.
