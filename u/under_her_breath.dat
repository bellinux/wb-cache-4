2500|$|The term bitch {{can refer}} to a person or thing that is very difficult, as in [...] "Life's a bitch". It is common for insults to lose {{intensity}} as their meaning broadens ("bastard" [...] is another example). In the film The Women (1939), Joan Crawford could only allude to the word: [...] "And by the way, there's a name for you ladies, but it isn't used in high society - outside of a kennel." [...] At the time, use of the actual word would have been censored by the Hays Office. By 1974, Elton John had a hit single (#4 in the U.S. and #14 in the U.K.) with [...] "The Bitch Is Back", in which he says [...] "bitch" [...] repeatedly. It was, however, censored by some radio stations. On late night U.S. television, the character Emily Litella (1976-1978) on Saturday Night Live (portrayed by Gilda Radner) would frequently refer to Jane Curtin <b>under</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> {{at the end of}} their Weekend Update routine in this way: [...] "Oh! Never mind...! Bitch!" ...|$|E

60|$|Gwendolen was mute. The daring anger {{within her}} {{was turned into}} the rage of dumbness. What reasons for her belief could she give? All the reasons that seemed so strong and living within her--she saw them suffocated and shrivelled up <b>under</b> <b>her</b> husband's <b>breath.</b> There was no proof to give, but her own impression, which would seem to him her own folly. She turned her head quickly {{away from him and}} looked angrily {{toward the end of the}} room: she would have risen, but he was in her way.|$|R

60|$|She {{tried to}} follow him on his journey to Croydon. Now he'd have just passed out of London Bridge. What was he {{thinking}} and feeling about her in the train?

5000|$|Boom Boom's goons {{show up to}} {{make good}} on his threat. Harry and Helen run and end up cornered in an alley. Harry tries to talk his way out of what is coming by {{explaining}} that the goons should be after the guy who fought with Al and caused his heart attack. He throws Peck's $12,000 in the air as the final exclamation point on his speech and walks Helen past the goons, asking <b>her</b> <b>under</b> his <b>breath,</b> [...] "How'd I do?" [...] The goons shoot Harry in the back and throw their pistols in a dumpster.|$|R
60|$|The light {{raised by}} <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> {{had been very}} fitful, and a {{momentary}} irradiation of flesh was all that it had disclosed of her face.

5000|$|Morty {{is relying}} on the vote of Mabel Choate to save him from impeachment. The vote is {{reversed}} when Mabel hears Jack Klompus refer to <b>her</b> <b>under</b> his <b>breath</b> as an [...] "old bag," [...] triggering her memory of the incident when Jerry had used that same epithet on her. Mabel then rants to Morty {{that it was his}} son who stole the rye bread from her and votes for Morty's impeachment. With some of the other board members changing their vote, Morty is removed from office as {{he was the only one}} who voted against it. In accordance with the second constitution of The Pines of Mar Gables Phase II, Herb has condo vice-president Jack Klompus sworn in as the new condo president.
