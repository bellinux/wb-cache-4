US guidelines are more consistently in favor of their <b>use</b> <b>than</b> their European equivalents. The use of RSTs may be most beneficial in the third world, where the complications of streptococcal infection are most prevalent, but their use in these regions has not been well studied.|$|E

25|$|Uses of Monte Carlo methods require {{large amounts}} of random numbers, and it was their use that spurred the {{development}} of pseudorandom number generators, which were far quicker to <b>use</b> <b>than</b> the tables of random numbers that had been previously used for statistical sampling.|$|E
25|$|As {{a commonplace}} {{construction}} and home decorating material, plaster is widely available. Its rigidity limits {{its use in}} moulds, and plaster moulds are unsuitable when undercuts are present. This may make plaster far more difficult to <b>use</b> <b>than</b> softer materials like latex or silicone.|$|E

25|$|The Assyrians {{were the}} first to use camels as beasts of burden for their {{military}} campaigns. Camels were of greater <b>use</b> <b>than</b> donkeys because they can carry five times the load and yet require less watering. Camels were not domesticated until shortly before 1000 BC, {{on the eve of the}} Neo-Assyrian Empire.|$|E
25|$|Three-dimensional {{printing}} is {{a method}} of converting a virtual 3D model into a physical object. 3D printing is a category of rapid prototyping technology. 3D printers typically work by 'printing' successive layers {{on top of the}} previous to build up a three dimensional object. 3D printers are generally faster, more affordable and easier to <b>use</b> <b>than</b> other additive fabrication technologies.|$|E

25|$|In {{particle}} physics as radiators in Cherenkov effect detectors, {{such as the}} ACC system of the Belle detector, used in the Belle Experiment at KEKB. The suitability of aerogels is determined by their low index of refraction, filling the gap between gases and liquids, and their transparency and solid state, making them easier to <b>use</b> <b>than</b> cryogenic liquids or compressed gases. Their low mass is also advantageous for space missions.|$|E
25|$|People {{with high}} scores on a psychopathy rating scale {{are more likely to}} engage in bullying, crime and drug <b>use</b> <b>than</b> other people. Hare and Babiak noted that about 29 per cent of {{corporate}} psychopaths are also bullies. Other research has also shown that people with {{high scores on}} a psychopathy rating scale were {{more likely to engage in}} bullying, again indicating that psychopaths tend to be bullies in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|The Rose turret was a roomy design {{equipped}} with two M2 Browning heavy machine guns. The turret {{was driven by}} hydraulics, and the hydraulic system was easier to <b>use</b> <b>than</b> that in previous designs. The considerable internal space meant that the turret could be fitted with two seats: a layout in which one man operated the guns and the other fed targeting data into the gunsight computer was developed, but not used in practice.|$|E

However, magnetic compasses are still widely in use {{as they can be}} small, use simple reliable technology, are comparatively cheap, are often easier to <b>use</b> <b>than</b> GPS, require no energy supply, and unlike GPS, are not affected by objects, e.g. trees, that can block the reception of electronic signals.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of {{stock market index}} futures has provided a second means of hedging risk on a single stock by selling short the market, as opposed to another single or selection of stocks. Futures are generally highly fungible and cover {{a wide variety of}} potential investments, which makes them easier to <b>use</b> <b>than</b> trying to find another stock which somehow represents the opposite of a selected investment. Futures hedging is widely used as part of the traditional long/short play.|$|E

25|$|In part this {{is because}} the {{underlying}} hip problem may be mild or severe, may be worsening or stable, and the body may be more or less able to keep the joint in repair well enough to cope. Also, different animals have different pain tolerances and different weights, and use their bodies differently, so a light dog who only walks, will have a different joint <b>use</b> <b>than</b> a more heavy or very active dog. Some dogs will have a problem early on, others may never have a real problem at all.|$|E
25|$|The oil sales losses Iran is {{experiencing}} {{are likely to}} produce over $50 billion in hard currency revenue losses in a one-year period at current oil prices. The IMF estimated Iran’s hard currency reserves to be $106 billion as {{of the end of}} 2011, and some economists say that figure may have fallen to about $80 billion as of November 2012. Analysts at one outside group, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, believe Iran’s hard currency reserves might be exhausted entirely by July 2014 at current rates of depletion. Compounding the loss of oil sales by volume is that many of its oil transactions reportedly are now conducted on a barter basis—or in exchange for gold, which is hard currency but harder to <b>use</b> <b>than</b> cash is. In addition, the 6 February 2013, imposition of sanctions on Iran’s ability to repatriate hard currency could cause the depletion rate to increase.|$|E
25|$|Several {{factors were}} {{incorporated}} into the compact Nash Rambler's marketing mix that including making the most from the limited steel supplies during the Korean War, {{as well as the}} automaker selecting a strategy for profit maximization from the new Rambler line. The new Nash Rambler came only in a convertible body, a style that had a higher price in the marketplace and incorporating more standard features that make the open top models suitable more for leisure-type <b>use</b> <b>than</b> ordinary transportation. With a base price of $1,808 (equivalent to approximately $ in today's funds), the Nash Rambler was priced slightly lower than the base convertible models from its intended competition. To further increase the value to buyers, the Nash Rambler was well equipped compared to the competition and included numerous items as standard equipment such as whitewall tires, full wheel covers, electric clock, and even a pushbutton AM radio that were available at extra cost on all other cars at that time.|$|E

30|$|Fourteen {{websites}} {{for different}} product lines of disinfectants were analysed in 2012 whether they complied with legal requirements regarding advertisement and what use of disinfectants they proposed. Most {{of the companies}} followed these legal requirements regarding advertisements but promoted their products for more <b>uses</b> <b>than</b> necessary. Little changes were detected after a revisit of the websites in 2014. The websites of the companies did not give a full overview over the hazards and still promoted more <b>uses</b> <b>than</b> necessary.|$|R
