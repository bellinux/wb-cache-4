40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{two types}} of n-bit adders, ripple carry adders and cascaded carry look-ahead adders, with <b>minimum</b> <b>tests</b> for stuck-at fault models. In the first part, we present {{two types of}} full adders consisting of five gates, and show their minimality. We also prove {{that one of the}} full adders can be tested by only three test patterns for single stuck-at faults. We also present two types of 4 -bit carry look-ahead adders and their <b>minimum</b> <b>tests.</b> In the second part, we consider the tests for the cascaded adders, an n-bit ripple carry adder and a 4 m-bit cascaded carry look-ahead adders. These tests are considerably smaller than previously published ones. In this paper, we consider two types of n-bit adders with <b>minimum</b> <b>tests</b> for stuck-at fault models: Ripple carry adders and cascaded carry look-ahead adders. First, we show the minimality of full adders shown in Fig. 1. They contain the minimum number of gates among adders consisting of only 2 -input gates.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a test set for an ALU with look ahead carry generators(LCGs). The ALU is logically partitioned {{into two groups}} of blocks, the group of one-bit operation units and LCG group. Each group is tested in parallel and exhaustively, independent of the other. And an easily testable design is applied to several blocks for decreasing {{the number of the}} input combinations of them. Under the easily testable design, a <b>minimum</b> <b>test</b> set for each group is generated, and the upper and lower bounds for a <b>minimum</b> <b>test</b> for the ALU are derived. The difference of the lower and upper bounds is not large, and a test set whose number of test vectors is equal to the upper bound can be easily obtained as the union of <b>minimum</b> <b>test</b> sets for two groups. Hence, the union {{can be used as a}} complete and practical test set for the ALU...|$|R

Study 1 : 32 subjects performed a lactate <b>minimum</b> <b>test</b> comprising a lactate elevation phase, recovery phase, and incremental phase (five 4 min stages); MLSS was subsequently determined. Study 2 : 8 subjects performed a lactate <b>minimum</b> <b>test</b> and five 22 min constant power tests at the incremental phase exercise intensities. Study 3 : 10 subjects performed two identical lactate <b>minimum</b> <b>tests,</b> except during the second test the lactate elevation phase comprised arm-cranking. Lactate minimum and MLSS powers demonstrated good agreement (mean bias+/- 95 % limits of agreement: 2 +/- 22 W). Rates of change of blood lactate concentration during each incremental phase stage and corresponding constant power test did not correlate. Lactate minimum power was lowered when arm-cranking was used during the lactate elevation phase (157 +/- 29 vs. 168 +/- 21 W; p< 0. 05). The lactate elevation phase modifies blood lactate concentration responses during the incremental phase, thus good agreement between lactate minimum and MLSS powers seems fortuitous...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to propose a {{specific}} lactate <b>minimum</b> <b>test</b> for elite basketball players considering the: Running Anaerobic Sprint Test (RAST) as a hyperlactatemia inductor, short distances (specific distance, 20 m) during progressive intensity and mathematical analysis to interpret aerobic and anaerobic variables. The basketball players were assigned to four groups: All positions (n= 26), Guard (n= 7), Forward (n= 11) and Center (n= 8). The hyperlactatemia elevation (RAST) method consisted of 6 maximum sprints over 35 m separated by 10 s of recovery. The progressive phase of the lactate <b>minimum</b> <b>test</b> consisted of 5 stages controlled by an electronic metronome (8. 0, 9. 0, 10. 0, 11. 0 and 12. 0 km/h) over a 20 m distance. The RAST variables and the lactate values were analyzed using visual and mathematical models. The intensity of the lactate <b>minimum</b> <b>test,</b> determined by a visual method, reduced in relation to polynomial fits (2 nd degree) for the Small Forward positions and General groups. The Power and Fatigue Index values, determined by both methods, visual and 3 rd degree polynomial, were not significantly different between the groups. In conclusion, the RAST is an excellent hyperlactatemia inductor and the progressive intensity of lactate <b>minimum</b> <b>test</b> using short distances (20 m) can be specifically used to evaluate the aerobic capacity of basketball players. In addition, no differences were observed between the visual and polynomial methods for RAST variables, but lactate minimum intensity was influenced by the method of analysi...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — As {{the cost}} of {{executing}} and maintaining a large test suite is always expensive, many heuristic techniques have been brought out for test suite reduction in spite of no guarantee of minimum size. The integer linear programming (ILP) approach can generate <b>minimum</b> <b>test</b> suites but it may cost exponential time. This paper proposes a degraded ILP (DILP) approach {{to bridge the gap}} between the ILP method and traditional heuristic methods. The DILP can produce a lower bound of <b>minimum</b> <b>test</b> suite and then search a small test suite close to the lower bound. An empirical evaluation of DILP is designed on Boolean specification-based testing. Four typical heuristic reduction strategies: G, GRE, H and GC are compared with DILP empirically. The experimental results show that DILP always outperforms other heuristic reduction strategies and it sometimes can guarantee the minimum size. I...|$|R

With the <b>minimum</b> sufficient <b>test</b> set, decoding complexity can be greatly reduced {{while maintaining the}} optimal performance. At the second stage, ordered processing is performed over the estimated <b>minimum</b> sufficient <b>test</b> set ˆ S to find the optimal solution. Ordered processing helps to find the optimal solution quickly and in the meanwhile enables complexity-reduced sub-optimal solution with bounded block error rate. Simulation result shows that this algorithm achieves the optimal performance with low average computational complexity. ...|$|R

As the cost of a test increases with increasing test duration, there is a desire to have a prior estimate of the <b>minimum</b> <b>test</b> duration that yields valid results. Many authors proposed a recommended minimum duration, based on practical field experience (Gehlin 1998; Austin 1998). Other authors developed a method to estimate the <b>minimum</b> <b>test</b> duration based on the borehole and soil properties (Beier and Smith 2003). The probabilistic criterion proposed consists of finding a consistent value based on a forward regression (FR) procedure: when the slope value does not show a meaningful change by an increment of the test time, it can be assumed that the heat transfer in the underground follows the predicted evaluation model, and the evaluation time is large enough to provide for the statistical precision desired.|$|R

These results indicate that a plate-like bone structure with high BMD or BV exhibits high <b>test</b> <b>forces,</b> as reported in a previous study [17]. Among the volume BMD and micro-architectural parameters in this study, BS/TV was the parameter that best predicted the two <b>test</b> <b>forces</b> by itself.

40|$|Driven by the {{industrial}} need for low-cost test methodologies, {{the academic community}} and the industry alike have put forth a number of efficient test data compression (TDC) methods. In addition, the need for core-based System-on-a-Chip (SoC) test led to considerable research in test access mechanism (TAM) design. While most previous work has considered TAM design and TDC independently, this work analyzes the interrelations between the two, outlining that a <b>minimum</b> <b>test</b> time solution obtained using TAM design will not necessarily correspond to a <b>minimum</b> <b>test</b> time solution when compression is applied. This {{is due to the}} dependency of some TDC methods on test bus width and care bit density, both of which are related to test time, and hence to TAM design. Therefore, this paper illustrates the importance of considering the characteristics of the compression method when performing TAM design, and it also shows how an existing TAM design method can be enhanced toward a compression-driven solution. 1...|$|R
30|$|Spinal {{instrumentation}} surgeries are popular, and {{an increasing}} number of surgeries is being performed annually [1, 2]. Implant stability is important in spinal instrumentation surgeries, as it ensures secure fixation of the implant to the bone and prevents implant fixation failure [3, 4]. In particular, in the field of spinal surgery, the rate of postoperative pedicle screw loosening has been reported to be up to 12 % [5, 6]. Galbusera et al. [7] reported a screw loosening incidence of up to 60 % among patients with osteoporosis. Pedicle screw loosening {{is one of the major}} indications for revision after spinal surgery [8].
