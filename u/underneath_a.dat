5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric <b>underneath.</b> <b>A</b> wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar <b>underneath</b> <b>a</b> large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
5|$|In early July, {{widespread}} {{showers and}} thunderstorms developed across the Western Pacific <b>underneath</b> <b>a</b> tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT). On July9, a single cumulonimbus cloud west of Wake Island became {{associated with the}} TUTT and quickly organized. By July11, the system featured a small central dense overcast and soon became sufficiently organized for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to declare it as Tropical Depression 11W. Upon classification, the system was located roughly 320km (200mi) east of the Northern Mariana Islands. The development of the depression was unprecedented in two ways: first, a single cloud developed into a tropical cyclone; and second, it became tropical while situated <b>underneath</b> <b>a</b> cold-core low.|$|E

5|$|K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' died between AD435 and AD437. In 1995 a tomb {{underneath}} the talud-tablero Hunal temple {{was discovered by}} a team of archaeologists led by Robert Sharer and David Sedat. The tomb contained the skeleton of an elderly man with rich offerings and evidence of battle wounds. The remains have been identified as those of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' due to their location <b>underneath</b> <b>a</b> sequence of seven buildings erected in his honor. Bone analysis has identified the remains as being those of someone foreign to Copán.|$|E
5|$|Kona lows, most extra{{tropical}} cyclones, {{and tropical}} upper tropospheric cyclones are cold core lows. In {{the eastern half}} of the north Pacific ocean and north Indian ocean, the formation of a weak circulation <b>underneath</b> <b>a</b> mid to upper-tropospheric low which has cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the cold season (winter) is called a subtropical cyclone. In the case of the north Indian ocean, the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season.|$|E

The clone then crawls underneath her bed and finds himself <b>underneath</b> <b>a</b> car. He opens the package and finds a gasoline can, which he pours into a compartment located behind the car's license plate. All three clones enter the car and drive to the box, which they step back into; the video concludes with the box's explosion.|$|E
5|$|Variants of {{the flame}} fougasse {{included}} the demigasse, a barrel on its side and left in the open with explosive buried underneath; and the hedge hopper: a barrel on end with explosive buried <b>underneath</b> <b>a</b> few inches deep and slightly off centre. On firing, the hedge hopper barrel was projected ten feet (3m) {{into the air and}} over a hedge or wall behind which it had been hidden. 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were installed at 7,000 sites mostly in southern England and at a further 2,000 sites in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Adrienne {{visits the}} nearly 110-year-old Malcolm Wyrmshadow (Douglas Seale), {{who had been}} Carno's {{apprentice}} as a young boy. Malcolm reveals that Carno met his demise after his last wife, Marie (Traci Clauson), discovered he was a murderer. Marie conspired with her lover, Gaston (Jeff Rector), to kill Carno by sabotaging the equipment for his most infamous and dangerous escapology trick, in which Carno dons a burning hood and escapes from bonds on a throne <b>underneath</b> <b>a</b> swinging axe. The sabotage leaves Carno horribly burned and disfigured, but he survives and viciously attacks Marie and Gaston. After killing Marie by beheading her, Carno is killed by Gaston, who then succumbs to his own wounds.|$|E

5|$|First on the {{schedule}} were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas {{on the site of}} a derelict hotel which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted with in 1977 during the filming of The Spy Who Loved Me. In the scene, Bond drives a digger toward the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar <b>underneath.</b> <b>A</b> section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.|$|E
5|$|Galactica departs {{the station}} and rises a chain lift hill. The ride's first drop dips to the right, before rising back up and flying through the ride's centrepiece theming element, a portal, which links to the ride's space theme. Followed by this, riders are turned from the prone {{position}} onto their backs. The coaster then performs a large upward left turn before twisting again, returning riders to the prone position. After exiting from the lie-to-fly element, Galactica passes <b>underneath</b> <b>a</b> small ravine before pitching up, into a tight turn over the plaza area. A 360 degrees inline twist is followed up {{by a series of}} straight flying, and several turns and dips in the track. The train then comes to a stop on the brake run before returning to one of the station's two stations.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, 2002, McMahon {{returned}} to the WWE (formerly WWF until a lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund) as {{the general manager of}} SmackDown. In contrast to her McMahon-Helmsley era villain character, Stephanie became a fan favorite, as she began to favor fan favorite wrestlers at that time. She feuded with Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff. On the October 31 episode of SmackDown! at a Halloween party, Stephanie McMahon and Eric Bischoff shared a kiss while McMahon was dressed as a witch and Bischoff was disguised as her father <b>underneath</b> <b>a</b> mask. McMahon was given credit for the return of the WWE United States Championship and for the creation of the WWE Tag Team Championship. She was also credited with signing Hulk Hogan back to SmackDown!, which caused friction between herself and her father.|$|E

5|$|The Commando units {{went through}} a number of {{organisational}} structures as the concept was refined and their roles became clearer throughout the course of the war. Upon formation, No. 3 Commando had an establishment of 535 all ranks organised into ten troops each with 50 men <b>underneath</b> <b>a</b> headquarters troop. In late 1940, the Commando units were merged into a special service brigade which was made up of five special service battalions, each of which were made up of two company-sized elements. By the end of the year, this was changed again as the battalions were organised around a headquarters and two Commandos. The special service battalion organisation was discontinued in March 1941, and the unit establishment was set at 470 all ranks, with a headquarters troop of 80 officers and men and six troops of three officers and 62 other ranks.|$|E
5|$|The main ways {{water vapor}} {{is added to}} the air are: wind {{convergence}} into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped <b>underneath</b> <b>a</b> warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} frosting {{of areas}} near the southern ice cap {{results in the}} formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening {{in the space of a}} few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. The gas rushing <b>underneath</b> <b>a</b> slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.|$|E
