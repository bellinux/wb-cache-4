500|$|Nala means [...] "gift" [...] in Swahili. The {{character}} has a mother, {{whose name is}} never mentioned in the film; however, she is credited as Sarafina during the film's end credits. Candice Russel of the Sun-Sentinel believes that Nala contributes to the film's love story – [...] "an indispensable factor in Disney cartoon features" [...] – in addition to convincing Simba to return to Pride Rock. It has been observed that, unlike Disney's three previous animated efforts (The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992), the romantic relationship between Nala and Simba is not main plot of the film. Ella Ceron of Thought Catalog observed that [...] "At [...] return, she's not exactly the friendliest little kitten, either ... but is willing to overlook her own hurt ego {{in the spirit of}} their friendship. She believes in Simba, and doesn’t <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> wouldn’t want to fight for his right to rule." ...|$|E

500|$|Attention {{focused on}} the battle between Ralf Schumacher and Michael Schumacher during the race. Michael Schumacher blamed his brother for instigating the move and did not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was upset over the {{incident}}. Ralf Schumacher did not comment and stated that he would watch a video of the incident before he would say anything. Their father, Rolf talked to the pair {{in an effort to}} get them reconciled. One week after the race, Ralf Schumacher said that tensions between him and his brother had eased and that there were no hard feelings for each other, saying, [...] "It's a lot of fun when we are out there on the track duelling against each other." [...] There was similar ill-feeling between de la Rosa and Alesi after their collision on lap two. de la Rosa accused Alesi of blocking him, and of causing the crash by not looking in his mirrors, while Alesi said de la Rosa attempted to overtake him in a corner where overtaking is difficult.|$|E
500|$|Due to his {{resemblance}} with Roxas, {{video game}} publications initially thought that Roxas {{would be one}} of the protagonists from Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep when seeing one of Ventus' images. However, when it was revealed that the two were different, publications continued to discuss how similar they were and if there was a connection between them. GamesRadar particularly thought that there would be an eventual connection between the two of them and Sora. Amanda L. Kondolojy from Cheat Code Central also commented on speculations regarding the similarities between both of them, but mentioned that due to the existence of Nobodies in series, it is hard to find them as coincidences. When Jesse McCartney confirmed he was working on the English localization of Birth by Sleep, sites thought that he would voice Ventus, as he also voiced Roxas in previous titles. The character's story and actions shown in the demonstrations were praised for being the [...] "most original take on Kingdom Hearts" [...] and yet [...] "frustratingly traditional". Upon Ventus' introduction in Birth by Sleep, X-Play found the character to be very similar to Sora's due to his friendly attitude. Kevin VanOrd from the same site gave praise to Ventus' character for his [...] "well-meaning" [...] and yet not [...] "annoying" [...] personality. The site also said that the time players spend playing with Ventus would be [...] "rewarding" [...] and commented on the English voice acting. PlayStation LifeStyle's Thomas Williams found the trio of Ventus, Terra and Aqua as welcome additions to the franchise, finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds. On the other hand, PALGN found the three characters unappealing, labelling Ventus as [...] "just a Roxas clone, but without his personality." [...] In contrast to 1UP's comments towards Ventus' actions in Cinderella's world, VanOrd commented that such interactions to be [...] "more bothersome than boisterous." [...] Writing for GamesRadar, Chris Antistaer called Ventus a [...] "Roxas-clone", and did not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II. Bob Muir from Destructoid noted that in Birth by Sleep Ventus was the most important character by fans due to his similarities with Roxas. Additionally, Miur praised Jesse McCartney's work as Ventus' English voice actor that make his story mode more engaging to players.|$|E

[...] She said that her polling numbers indicated a uniform swing to Labor, with many people who had never voted Labor before crossing over to her.

Although he cross-trained with Lenoir and briefly proposed swapping positions with his crewmate, he elected to retain his original assignment due to the greater likelihood of the rescue mission (which could only accommodate the Commander and Pilot) amid the space program's dwindling flight opportunities.|$|E

Race leader Franz Engstler came through the kink on the start-finish straight and was unable to avoid hitting the side of the pace car.
