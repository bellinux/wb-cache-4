Dave Walsh of Five Star Apps said [...] "If you’re a big CSI or crime-genre fan I would say you definitely need to download this game when you have the chance", and rated it 5 stars out of 5. TapScape gave the game a rating of 8/10, and said [...] "Cause of Death is a great app for those who love pulp fiction and crime dramas like CSI and Criminal Minds. Though interactivity is limited, the scenarios are strong enough to make up for it." [...] Chris Hall of 148 Apps gave the series a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "While it probably won’t be of much interest to those who aren’t interested in reading, Cause of Death is definitely the best interactive novel that I’ve come across in the App Store. It’s fairly smart, flows nicely, and most importantly, is fun. App <b>Unwrapper</b> gave the game 5/5 stars, writing [...] "The story is creepy and satisfying, with enough twists to keep you guessing till the end. If you’re a fan of horror or suspense stories, you won’t want to miss this one." [...] Andrew Webster of Gamezebo said [...] "Cause of Death: Can You Catch the Killer? is as heart pounding as any thriller on TV, even if it is essentially a text based adventure. The actual interactivity is quite limited, but the game is so well written and finely tuned that it doesn’t matter. It also features a great episodic structure that hopefully means we’ll still be playing Cause of Death for some time to come", and gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. Gamers Sphere gave the gave 8.5 out of 10, writing [...] "The game’s believable characters and well-written dialogue kept me extremely interested in the story, and the plot itself is clever and enjoyable. I felt like some of the quick-time events were unnecessary, but they are definitely not a deal breaker." [...] iFanzine wrote that the game was [...] "An intelligently written and gripping thriller powered by well implemented interactive elements, impressive production values and the gloss of a big-budget TV show. In short, a must-read game".|$|E

40|$|More {{and more}} speech {{technology}} and signal processing appli-cations {{make use of}} the phase information. A proper estimation and representation of the phase goes inextricably along with a correct phase unwrapping, which refers to the problem of find-ing the instance of the phase function chosen to ensure continu-ity. This paper proposes a new technique of phase unwrapping which is based on two mathematical considerations: i) a prop-erty of the unwrapped phase at Nyquist frequency, ii) the mod-ified Schur-Cohn’s algorithm which allows a fast calculation of the root distribution of polynomials with respect to the unit cir-cle. The proposed method is compared to five state-of-the-art phase <b>unwrappers</b> on a large dataset of both synthetic random and real speech signals. By leveraging the two aforementioned considerations, the proposed approach is shown to perform an exact estimation of the unwrapped phase at a reduced computa-tional load...|$|R
40|$|In {{a typical}} {{interferometric}} {{synthetic aperture radar}} (IFSAR) system employed for terrain elevation mapping, terrain height is estimated from phase difference data obtained from two phase centers separated spatially in the cross-track direction. In this paper we show how the judicious design of a three phase center IFSAR renders phase unwrapping, i. e., the process of estimating true continuous phases from principal values of phase (wrapped modulo 2 {pi}), a much simpler process than that inherent in traditional algorithms. With three phase centers, one IFSAR baseline can be chosen to be relatively small (two of the phase centers close together) so {{that all of the}} scene`s terrain relief causes less than one cycle of phase difference. This allows computation of a coarse height map without use of any form of phase unwrapping. The cycle number ambiguities in the phase data derived from the other baseline, chosen to be relatively large (two of the phase centers far apart), can then be resolved by reference to the heights computed from the small baseline data. This basic concept of combining phase data from one small and one large baseline to accomplish phase unwrapping has been previously employed in other interferometric problems, e. g., laser interferometry and direction-of-arrival determination from multiple element arrays, The new algorithm is shown to possess a certain form of immunity to corrupted interferometric phase data that is not inherent in traditional two-dimensional path-following phase <b>unwrappers.</b> This is because path-following algorithms must estimate, either implicity or explicity, those portions of the IFSAR fringe data where discontinuities in phase occur. Such discontinuties typically arise from noisy phase measurements derived from low radar return areas of the SAR imagery, e. g., shadows, or from areas of steep terrain slope...|$|R
40|$|Here, {{we present}} a fast {{algorithm}} for two-dimensional (2 D) phase unwrapping which behaves as a recursive linear filter. This linear behavior allows us to easily find its frequency response and stability conditions. Previously, we published a robust to noise recursive 2 D phase unwrapping system with smoothing capabilities. But our previous approach was rather heuristic {{in the sense that}} not general 2 D theory was given. Here an improved and better understood version of our previous 2 D recursive phase <b>unwrapper</b> is presented. In addition, a full characterization of it is shown in terms of its frequency response and stability. The objective here is to extend our previous unwrapping algorithm and give a more solid theoretical foundation to it...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{relative}} depth estimation using interferometric sidelooking sonar. We give a thorough {{description of the}} geometry of interferometric sonar and of time delay estimation techniques. We present a novel solution for the depth estimate using sidelooking sonar, and review the cross-correlation function, the cross-uncertainty function and the phase-differencing technique. We find an elegant solution to co-registration and unwrapping by interpolating the sonar data in ground-range. Two depth estimation techniques are developed: Cross-correlation based sidescan bathymetry and synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) interferometry. We define flank length {{as a measure of}} the horizontal resolution in bathymetric maps and find that both sidescan bathymetry and SAS interferometry achieve theoretical resolutions. The vertical precision of our two methods are close to the performance predicted from the measured coherence. We study absolute phase-difference estimation using bandwidth and find a very simple split-bandwidth approach which outperforms a standard 2 D phase <b>unwrapper</b> on complicated objects. We also examine advanced filtering of depth maps. Finally, we present pipeline surveying as an example application of interferometric SAS...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of public-domain software {{in the scientific}} community has stimulated a fast and free dissemination of ideas. Here we present latest contributions to public-domain radar interferometry software to create interferometric products and to analyze and visualize these products. We present the feasibility of the Doris radar interferometric software of Delft University of Technology to create ENVISAT interferometric products such as DEMs and deformation maps. A stepwise description of the creation of an ENVISAT DEM of the Las Vegas area is presented, using besides Doris the ESA BEAM toolbox, the statistical cost phase <b>unwrapper</b> SNAPHU (Stanford University), the Generic Mapping Tools (University of Hawaii), and the PROJ. 4 package (USGS). Finally, the GRASS GIS software is used to drape a LandSAT image on top of the computed DEM in order to show the analysis and visualization capabilities of this free GIS package. These packages are also described briefly in this paper. Both advantages as well as drawbacks of these tools are discussed. It is the intention of this paper to demonstrate how a larger scientific community can benefit from freely available tools, and which contributions need to be solicited for. ...|$|E
