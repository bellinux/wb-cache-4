60|$|Away ran the hostlers and the boys. The {{lanterns}} glimmered, {{as the men}} ran to and fro; the horses' hoofs clattered on the <b>uneven</b> <b>paving</b> of the yard; the chaise rumbled as it {{was drawn}} out of the coach-house; and all was noise and bustle.|$|E
60|$|This gentleman {{walked with}} much {{deliberation}} {{into the bar}} {{to make out the}} bill: which took a long time making out: and after it was ready, and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which took up ten good minutes more. Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety, that {{he felt as if he}} could have jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to the next stage. At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having been handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery, the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling over the <b>uneven</b> <b>paving</b> of the market-place, was out of the town, and galloping along the turnpike-road, in a couple of minutes.|$|E
60|$|The day {{was hot and}} sunny, {{the town}} in the zenith of its dulness, and with the {{exception}} of these few idlers, not a living creature was to be seen. Suddenly, the loud notes of a key-bugle broke the monotonous stillness of the street; in came the coach, rattling over the <b>uneven</b> <b>paving</b> with a noise startling enough to stop even the large-faced clock itself. Down got the outsides, up went the windows in all directions, out came the waiters, up started the ostlers, and the loungers, and the post-boys, and the ragged boys, as if they were electrified—unstrapping, and unchaining, and unbuckling, and dragging willing horses out, and forcing reluctant horses in, and making a most exhilarating bustle. ‘Lady inside, here!’ said the guard. ‘Please to alight, ma’am,’ said the waiter. ‘Private sitting-room?’ interrogated the lady. ‘Certainly, ma’am,’ responded the chamber-maid. ‘Nothing but these ’ere trunks, ma’am?’ inquired the guard. ‘Nothing more,’ replied the lady. Up got the outsides again, and the guard, and the coachman; off came the cloths, with a jerk; ‘All right,’ was the cry; and away they went. The loungers lingered a minute or two in the road, watching the coach until it turned the corner, and then loitered away one by one. The street was clear again, and the town, by contrast, quieter than ever.|$|E
60|$|If we were disagreeably {{disappointed}} in the antiquities of the town, we were as agreeably {{disappointed in}} the inn. It was clean, gave us a good dinner, and, as almost invariably proves {{to be the case}} in France, also gave us good beds. I do not remember ever to have been more fatigued than by the five posts between Paris and this place. The <b>uneven</b> <b>pavés,</b> the random and careless driving of the postillions, with whom it is a point of honour to gallop over the broken streets of the villages, besides having a strong fellow-feeling for the smiths, always makes the eight or ten posts nearest to Paris, much the most disagreeable part of a journey to or from the French capital.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of three}} people riding donkeys through an {{intersection}} in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, 1937. The small donkeys are carrying the people, {{as well as}} two large baskets each. All three of the people are wearing large straw sombreros. The corner of a large building is visible in the background. The street on which the burros are walking is rough and <b>uneven,</b> but <b>paved.</b> A manhole cover {{can be seen in the}} foreground at left. Several posters written in Spanish can be seen on the wall in the background, one of them advertising Teatro Tivoli (by 1937, there were two Tivoli Theaters [...] one in Guadalajara and another one in México City), while another poster advertises "Amapola del Camino", a movie filmed in 1937. Above the posters, a plate with "Calle Juan Manuel" street name can be seen...|$|R

Press release: STOPPED CLOCKS IN PLACES OF BUSYNESS Saturday 12 th October - Saturday 9 th November 2013 Joey Bryniarska, Sarah Poots, Joe Frazer, Kate Owens, Caline Aoun, Maija Luutonen, Patrick Coyle, Tom Woolner Plus a {{performance}} by Patrick Coyle at 8 pm during the opening night I …Sunglasses are laid out on blankets beneath an overpass…containers are used to move multiples of the same object around over concrete…shadows from tall buildings tell the time across <b>uneven</b> <b>paving</b> slabs and down into stairwells…as a miscommunication arises between two people, a plane seemingly disappears into a building…a cigarette is left at rest and no harm is done… II I was trying to describe a short story last read roughly ten years ago. Its shape. Its form. The details had disappeared but I still retained a sense of it. Of how it felt. This passing of time not only depletes and erases but also results in a freedom to sidestep, to meander, to completely reinvent. III I kept turning it over in my head, like an object, in order to better understand it. – John Lawrenc...|$|E
40|$|Autor u radu analizira proporcije palače Užižić, kuće unutar iste palače te obližnje crkve sv. Kuzme i Damjana, povodom rekonstrukcije ovih građevina. In {{this text}} the author {{analyses}} {{the proportions of}} the Užižić Palace, the houses inside the palace and the nearby Church of Ss. Cosmas and Damian. The Užižić Palace stands above the main town gates of Porta Maestra. The palace was never finished, and it was never covered by a roof. People lived within {{the interior of the}} building up to 1950. Previously, the building was called the Leporini Palace, then the Hektorović Palace, because of the family crests carved on its windows, but Joško Kovačić proved that it was Nikola Užižić who started building the palace in 1463, so that the proper name for it was the Užižić Palace. This author recommends that it should be called 2 ̆ 7 Golden Palace 2 ̆ 7 because of its proportions. In spring 2010, the palace was extended upwards by three lines of stones and a cornice (stone gutter). The facade of the palace no longer has the proportions as envisaged by the architect who designed it in the 14 th century. Inside the building is another house which is older. The Church of Ss. Cosmas and Damian in Hvar is situated inside a Romanesque house built around the end of the 13 th century. So a family house was reconstructed as a church, and this happened around the end of the 16 th or the beginning of the 17 th century. The house in which the church was built was the benefice of the patrician Ozor Kačić. The church is being restored at present time, and previously unknown details have been discovered about how the house had looked when it was a residence. The facades of the Romanesque residential house were square. Probing under the floor in the northeastern aisle of the church and in the apse at a depth of 10 - 12 cm revealed a stone slab from the Romanesque house, while at a depth of 1. 4 m there was a floor of <b>uneven</b> <b>paving</b> stones, most probably from late antiquity, and part of a wall with traces of plastering in an east-west orientation, {{at the foot of the}} step of the apse. Many antique relics were also found...|$|E
