5|$|Aravan-head icons {{are either}} painted or <b>unpainted</b> {{portable}} ones for processions; they are housed {{together in the}} temples of his shrines. Koovagam, Kothadai, Kothattai and Pillaiyarkuppam have icons painted with a red face and multi-coloured ornamentation. <b>Unpainted</b> black stone images of the Aravan-head are seen in Kothattai, Madhukarai and Pillaiyarkuppam.|$|E
5|$|The {{cars had}} an aluminium-alloy {{double-skinned}} construction, and were delivered <b>unpainted</b> to save time. A red adhesive strip {{ran through the}} length of the cars in the middle to match the operator's visual branding. The <b>unpainted</b> cars had a shiny appearance upon delivery, but as dirt and grime accumulated it became a recurring problem for the operator and attracted several public complaints. In response, MRT Corporation built a wash machine at Bishan Depot in an attempt to clean up the cars' exterior proper. After refurbishment, the problem was solved by covering the cars' exterior entirely with giant stickers, creating a livery that is similar to the newer C751B and C151A rolling stocks.|$|E
5|$|Also {{constructed}} were a small fuel store, workshop, paint {{store and}} earth closet near the keeper's cottage, and two fuel stores with earth closet and sink for the assistant cottages. All were {{constructed in the}} same form, from <b>unpainted</b> concrete blocked and the same terracotta tile roofs. All still remain in the complex, pretty much intact.|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} built, the Federal-style {{house had}} three stories. The completed house had {{four or five}} parlors. It was built of <b>unpainted,</b> cream-colored brick. The entrance was level with the ground, with an oriel window above it {{on the second floor}} and a Palladian window on the third floor above that. An oval portico protected visitors arriving at the front doors.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{residents}} of the Purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to restore Old Pine Church: the church's original windows were repaired and the <b>unpainted</b> weatherboards painted; a new roof was installed and the original wood floor replaced. The boarding room addition was probably removed (nothing of it now remains) and the pressed metal ceiling may have been added.|$|E
5|$|Inside the church, an {{intricate}} five-tier icon screen funded by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky and executed by Hryhoryi Petriv from Chernigov {{was installed in}} 1718. During {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, almost all of the original Byzantine mosaics and frescoes on the interior walls were painted over. Some restoration work on the mosaics and frescoes that remained <b>unpainted</b> was carried out {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century. However, there were no major and serious investigations of the walls done, so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under the newer coats of plaster.|$|E
5|$|To the {{north-east}} of {{the house}} is the estate's former stable building. This was built {{around the time of the}} fifth Earl's extension {{of the house}} and is aligned on a north-south axis. The building comprises three three-storey gable-fronted pavilions separated by a pair of two-storey wings. The façades are of brick, with the west façade painted white and the east <b>unpainted.</b> The roof is of slate with a clock tower in the centre of the east side of the central pavilion. Close to the stables is an underground brick-built ice house accessed by a vaulted tunnel. The ice house dates from 1788.|$|E
5|$|From 1937 {{new steel}} O stock trains, with doors {{remotely}} {{operated by the}} guard, replaced the wooden-bodied trains dating from 1906. It had been intended to operate the new trains with four or six cars, but after initial problems with the traction current only six-car formations were used. Services to Kensington (Olympia) via the curve at Latimer Road were suspended in 1940 after bomb damage to the West London line and not restarted after the war. When the similar trains running on the Circle line were lengthened to six cars in 1959 and 1960, the stock of the two lines was integrated with maintenance at Hammersmith depot. Aluminium C Stock trains, with public address systems and originally <b>unpainted,</b> replaced these trains from 1970. One person operation was proposed in 1972, but due to conflict with the trade unions was not introduced until 1984.|$|E
5|$|Nineteenth-century {{interiors}} could {{often be}} lavish and eclectic. The origins of this style were in Scott's Abbotsford, where the author began {{the incorporation of}} actual old architectural fragments and pieces of furniture on a lavish scale (the effective beginning of 'antique' collecting in Scotland). He also initiated the treatment of new surfaces so as to resemble old ones, with new wood darkened to resemble old oak. The Adam solution of a castellated exterior with a neo-classical interior was abandoned and in Baronial revival houses this change was extended to create a synthesised Victorian style that combined elements of the Renaissance, such as plastered or rubble walls, <b>unpainted</b> stone fireplaces and pitch pine timberwork, with seventeenth-century style plaster ceilings. To this were added symbols of landed power and national affiliation, including displays of tartan, weaponry and stuffed animals' heads. Integrated into these traditional materials and styles were modern fittings such as sprung upholstery, gaslighting and water-closets.|$|E
5|$|To {{reach the}} chapel's ceiling, Michelangelo {{designed}} his own scaffold, a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from {{holes in the}} wall {{near the top of}} the windows, rather than being built up from the floor. Mancinelli speculates that this was in order to cut the cost of timber. According to Michelangelo's pupil and biographer Ascanio Condivi, the brackets and frame that supported the steps and flooring were all put in place at the beginning of the work and a lightweight screen, possibly cloth, was suspended beneath them to catch plaster drips, dust, and splashes of paint. Only half the building was scaffolded at a time and the platform was moved as the painting was done in stages. The areas of the wall covered by the scaffolding still appear as <b>unpainted</b> areas across the bottom of the lunettes. The holes were re-used to hold scaffolding in the latest restoration.|$|E
25|$|The DMC-12 {{features}} {{a number of}} unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, <b>unpainted</b> stainless-steel body panels, and a rear-mounted engine.|$|E
25|$|A mock-up of an Innovia ART 100 car was {{stored at}} the Toronto Transit Commission Wychwood Carhouse by Disney Displays. This car was <b>unpainted</b> and non-operational. The fate of this vehicle is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Cobra Mark III {{production}} {{began on}} 1 January 1965; two prototypes {{had been sent}} to the United States in October 1964. Cars were sent to the US as <b>unpainted</b> rolling chassis, and they were finished in Shelby's workshop.|$|E
25|$|Random rubble {{stonework}} {{is largely}} exposed {{on the interior}} of the church, as are the blockwork quoins. The porch, nave and apse have <b>unpainted</b> timber ceilings. There are panels of painted timber under the window sills in the apse.|$|E
25|$|A {{purpose-built}} four-car set based {{directly on}} the 209-0 series design and classified E991 series was delivered to JR East's training centre in Shirakawa, Fukushima in 2000 for internal training use. Externally, it is finished in shōnan green/orange stripes on <b>unpainted</b> stainless steel.|$|E
25|$|The , by far {{the most}} common torii style, are {{characterized}} by curved upper lintels (kasagi and shimaki). Both curve slightly upwards. Kusabi are present. A myōjin torii can be made of wood, stone, concrete or other materials and be vermilion or <b>unpainted.</b>|$|E
25|$|An <b>unpainted</b> F-15A {{stripped}} of most avionics demonstrated the fighter's acceleration capabilities. The aircraft broke eight time-to-climb world records between 16 January and 1 February 1975 at Grand Forks AFB, ND. It {{was delivered to}} the National Museum of the United States Air Force in December 1980.|$|E
25|$|As {{import duties}} were high on {{finished}} goods and reduced on components, {{to get into}} the Spanish market, Meccano s.a. (France) exported sixteen <b>unpainted</b> and unassembled Dinky Toys to The Novades Poch Company in Barcelona. There the models were finished and fitted with specific Pirelli tyres.|$|E
25|$|Late model Lightnings were {{delivered}} <b>unpainted,</b> as per USAAF policy established in 1944. At first, field units tried to paint them, since pilots {{worried about being}} too visible to the enemy, {{but it turned out}} the reduction in weight and drag was a minor advantage in combat.|$|E
25|$|There is no uniform colour {{scheme for}} the goods wagons. Wooden parts of {{vehicles}} are usually painted dark brown, while components made of stainless light alloys usually remain <b>unpainted.</b> Tank wagons receive {{a dark green}} paint job on the tanks. The smooth sidewalls of modern boxcars are often used for advertising slogans.|$|E
25|$|Excavations at Tell el-Amarna in Egypt {{have found}} large {{deposits}} of Aegean pottery. These findings provide excellent insight {{to the shape}} range (especially closed forms) of Mycenaean pottery. By this time, monochrome painted wares were almost exclusively large kylikes and stemmed bowls while fine <b>unpainted</b> wares are found in a vast range of shapes.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{differences}} from a standard V70 AWD include a unique {{front and rear}} bumper, <b>unpainted</b> sidetrim and sills, a squarer version of the roof rails, a unique front grille and a big Cross Country decal across the tailgate. Buyers could also specify a two tone exterior colour. Interior details included thicker floor mats and special canvas/leather upholstery.|$|E
25|$|The archaeological {{transition}} from the Ubaid period to the Uruk period {{is marked by a}} gradual shift from painted pottery domestically produced on a slow wheel to a great variety of <b>unpainted</b> pottery mass-produced by specialists on fast wheels. The Uruk period is a continuation and an outgrowth of Ubaid with pottery being the main visible change.|$|E
25|$|A projecting, one-storey, cubical {{reception}} section {{provides access to}} the nave through a semi-circular arch with iron grillework. This foyer area is sheltered by a hipped Spanish tile roof. In addition, its walls are whitewashed, {{in contrast to the}} <b>unpainted</b> appearance of {{the main body of the}} church, strengthening the impression of a mission-style addition to a gothic structure.|$|E
25|$|A sunburst of {{straight}} and wavy gold rays interchange behind while projecting behind the Virgin are enclosed within a mandorla. Beyond the mandorla to {{right and left}} is an <b>unpainted</b> expanse, white in colour with a faint blue tinge. The present image shows the 1791 nitric acid spill on the top right side, unaffecting the subject matter's aureola.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of the deep bowl {{as well as the}} conical kylix in this age is what allows one to differentiate from LH IIIA. During LH IIIB paneled patterns also appear. Not long into this phase the deep bowl becomes the most popular decorated shape, although for <b>unpainted</b> wares the kylix is still the most produced.|$|E
25|$|The porch (4m x 2m x 3m high) has a carpeted floor, <b>unpainted,</b> {{rendered}} {{walls and}} a stained timber ceiling. The window in the northern wall of the porch has stained glass depicting a scene of Christ and children. The concrete frame above this window features the Christogram IHS (derived from the first three letters of the Greek name of Jesus).|$|E
25|$|However, one aircraft, an Airbus A321 under {{registration}} N578UW, {{has been}} left <b>unpainted</b> in the US Airways livery, as one of American's heritage aircraft. The {{only difference is that}} the actual US Airways logo near the front of the fuselage has been replaced with the American Airlines logo; however, the rest of the aircraft remains identical to US Airways livery.|$|E
25|$|Internally, the {{building}} has a concrete floor throughout and exposed <b>unpainted</b> timber truss arches. Sections of the roof have translucent sheeting for light, and the eastern end is supported by scaffolding. The single-storeyed office accommodation along the southwest projects into the space, and is constructed in hardboard sheeting and is surmounted by air handling equipment. The hangar is currently used for freight storage.|$|E
25|$|Goldfinger {{is obsessed}} with gold, {{going so far as}} to have yellow-bound erotic photographs, and have his lovers painted head to toe in gold so that he can make love to gold. (He leaves an area near the spine <b>unpainted,</b> but {{painting}} this area also is what kills Jill Masterton, as in the film). He is also a jeweller, a metallurgist, and a smuggler.|$|E
25|$|On October 24, 2013, {{the first}} pilot unit, #2001, was {{delivered}} to the MBTA Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility to begin testing and training. Two other pilot units were also released from MotivePower Industries: #2000 to GE's Test Facility in Erie, Pennsylvania, and #2003 to the Transportation Technology Center, Inc. test facility in Pueblo, Colorado. Only #2001 was given the MBTA paint scheme; the other two test units were <b>unpainted.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the pre-war trains had been {{replaced}} by new <b>unpainted</b> aluminium trains. One person operation had been planned in 1968, but conflict with the trade unions delayed introduction. The Metropolitan, East London, District and Circle lines were converted in 1985–86, the Piccadilly, Jubilee and Bakerloo lines following in 1987–88. One Person Operation was introduced on the Central and Northern lines after they received new trains in the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The {{units have}} four-abreast seating, with seats {{originally}} upholstered in dark blue leather. The interior was largely covered in aluminum and brown-painted plates. The window frames {{were covered in}} aluminum. The air ducts were at first painted brown, but passengers {{had a tendency to}} rest their feet on them. They were therefore kept <b>unpainted.</b> The motorman's cab was sealed off with an aluminum and plexiglas wall, later changed to a non-translucent aluminum to avoid reflections.|$|E
25|$|Torii gates were {{traditionally}} {{made from}} wood or stone, but today {{they can be}} also made of reinforced concrete, copper, stainless steel or other materials. They are usually either <b>unpainted</b> or painted vermilion with a black upper lintel. Inari shrines typically have many torii because {{those who have been}} successful in business often donate in gratitude a torii to Inari, kami of fertility and industry. Fushimi Inari-taisha in Kyoto has thousands of such torii, each bearing the donor's name.|$|E
25|$|The house Sweet {{purchased}} is a 1½-story brick house, {{built in}} 1919, and {{is typical of}} many homes in working-class Detroit neighborhoods. It is a Bungalow-style structure with a full basement, an open porch on the first floor, and an enclosed sun porch on the south side. The second story is covered with brown shingling, and atop {{the house is a}} simple gable roof with a central dormer. The house is enclosed by an <b>unpainted</b> silver aluminum fence.|$|E
25|$|The <b>unpainted</b> {{stainless}} body creates challenges during {{restoration of}} the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original ("straight") as possible and imperfections are sculpted back to form with body filler like Bondo or lead (body solder). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the quarter panel). With an <b>unpainted</b> stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain—which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to work-harden. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired; each DeLorean service center today {{has at least one}} experienced body repair person on staff, and there are decades worth of new stainless panels still available in most instances.|$|E
