40|$|Â© 2017 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands. Income {{inequality}} is {{a growing}} area of concern in both China and the United States, the world's two largest economies today. Alongside the traditional social welfare system, taxation and philanthropy are two alternative mechanisms to reduce inequality that have received increasing attention worldwide. This paper explores the roles of taxation and philanthropy in reducing inequality. In analyzing policies relating to taxation and philanthropy across several countries, this paper concludes that despite limitations and unintended consequences, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>systems</b> in China and the United States, taxation and philanthropy {{can and should be}} more effectively used to reduce income inequality.

25|$|<b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system,</b> {{immediate}} family members (spouse, child, and dependent mother and father), have priority status for green cards and generally wait 6 {{months to a}} year to have their green card application approved. For non-{{immediate family}} members, the process may take up to 10 years. Paperwork is processed on a first-come, first-served basis, so new applications may go untouched for several months. To address the issue of slow processing times, USCIS has made a policy allowing applicants to submit the I-130 and I-485 forms at the same time. This has reduced the processing time. Another delay in the process comes when applications have mistakes. In these cases papers are sent back to the applicant, further delaying the process. Currently the largest issue creating long wait times is not processing time, but rather immigrant visa quotas set by Congress.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} reasons for this discrepancy. First, some news sources include only pledged delegates in their total count, while others include superdelegates. Second, {{estimates}} of superdelegate votes are unreliable and are subject to change. Third, pledged delegates in many states are selected at county or state conventions late in the process; thus, the initial primary and caucus results provide only a projection of pledged delegates, highlighted by the discrepancies with the Iowa county convention results. Fourth, {{in the days after}} an election, results in individual precincts may be delayed, and news organizations may project the winners of those precincts based on statistical analysis or may wait for confirmed results. The Democratic nominating process is a complex system that has evolved over time, and in close races, it can be difficult <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system</b> to know who is leading in the delegate count.|$|E
25|$|The {{federal income}} tax system {{provides}} tax advantages {{to state and local}} municipal bonds. Specifically, the interest paid on such securities is exempt from federal taxation. This tax discount allows state and local governments to issue debt at low yields, which reduces their interest costs. By eliminating income taxes, FairTax would remove the federal tax advantage of holding state and local bonds as all investments would become tax free. However, the Treasury department has called for the elimination of these special tax provisions <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system</b> in an effort to broaden the tax base and reduce corporate tax rates. State and local governments often exempt their own taxes when issuing bonds, so they could still contain some advantages. Issuers may have to offer higher interest rates to attract investors. Americans For Fair Taxation argue that, after the fair tax goes into effect, corporate bond rates would drop; that new tax free yields will roughly equal their previous after tax value under the income tax; and that state and municipal bond holders would not need to change their rates.|$|E

500|$|Individuals <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system</b> who {{accumulated}} {{savings from}} ordinary income (by {{choosing not to}} spend their money when the income was earned) paid taxes on that income before it was placed in savings (such as a Roth IRA or CD). When individuals spend above the poverty level with money saved <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system,</b> that spending {{would be subject to}} the FairTax. People living through the transition may find both their earnings and their spending taxed. Critics have stated that the FairTax would result in unfair double taxation for savers and suggest it does not address the transition effect on some taxpayers who have accumulated significant savings from after-tax dollars, especially retirees who have finished their careers and switched to spending down their life savings. Supporters of the plan argue that the current system is no different, since compliance costs and [...] "hidden taxes" [...] embedded in the prices of goods and services cause savings to be [...] "taxed" [...] a second time already when spent. The rebate would supplement accrued savings, covering taxes up to the poverty level. The income taxes on capital gains, estates, social security and pension benefits would be eliminated under FairTax. In addition, the FairTax legislation adjusts Social Security benefits for changes in the price level, so a percentage increase in prices would result in an equal percentage increase to Social Security income. Supporters suggest these changes would offset paying the FairTax under transition conditions.|$|E
500|$|Opponents of {{the compact}} have raised {{concerns}} about election fraud. In his article, Pete du Pont argues that in 2000, [...] "Mr. Gore's 540,000-vote margin amounted to 3.1 votes {{in each of the}} country's 175,000 precincts. 'Finding' three votes per precinct in urban areas is not a difficult thing...". However, National Popular Vote has argued that the large pool of 122 million votes spread across the country would make a close or fraudulent outcome much less likely than <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system,</b> in which the national winner may be determined by an extremely small vote margin in any one of the fifty-one statewide tallies.|$|E
500|$|<b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system,</b> {{campaign}} focus – {{in terms}} of spending, visits, and attention paid to regional or state issues – is largely limited to the few swing states whose electoral outcomes are competitive, with politically [...] "solid" [...] states mostly ignored by the campaigns. The adjacent maps illustrate the amount spent on advertising {{and the number of}} visits to each state, relative to population, by the two major-party candidates in the last stretch of the 2004 presidential campaign. Supporters of the compact contend that a national popular vote would encourage candidates to campaign with equal effort for votes in competitive and non-competitive states alike. Critics of the compact argue that candidates would have less incentive to focus on states with smaller populations or fewer urban areas, and would thus be unmotivated to address rural issues.|$|E

Estimated by the advisory panel at approximately $600 billion, [...] "the Prebate program would cost more than all budgeted spending in 2006 on the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, and Interior combined."

500|$|With the {{transfer}} window reopening in January, Danny Wilson's first signing was {{the return of}} former loan player Marcus Williams who agreed a {{two and a half}} year deal. [...] The New Year started disappointingly as the Blades crashed to their first defeat since the beginning of November as they were beaten 3–2 at Carlisle United. Following Danny Wilson being awarded 'League One Manager of the Month' for December, United soon got back to winning ways when they returned to home soil. [...] The team saw off Salisbury City 3–1 in the third round of the FA Cup, the first meeting ever between the two clubs, and then outclassed Yeovil Town a few days later, hitting four without reply including a brace from Lee Williamson and a first ever club goal from captain Michael Doyle. With Danny Wilson looking to freshen up his squad United rewarded four of its younger players with contract extensions, with Erik Tønne and David McAllister set to remain with the club until the summer of 2014, and youth team players Jordan Chapell and Jack Adams agreeing new deals {{until the end of the}} season. In a busy day the club saw the departure of Elian Parrino as his short term deal came to an end, and then allowed McAllister to join League Two club Shrewsbury Town on a months loan, with manager Danny Wilson bemoaning a lack of reserve games <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system.</b> [...] The following week Wilson continued to overhaul the squad with reserve keeper Mihkel Aksalu leaving the club on mutual terms, but was boosted by 'fans favourite' James Beattie agreeing a deal to remain at Bramall Lane until the end of the season. Meanwhile, back in the league the Blades then continued their fine run of form, completing their second league double of the week, as they hit three without reply away at Bury, but that form deserted them for a top-of-the-table trip to Charlton Athletic where a bad tempered match resulted in both teams being reduced to ten men and a 1–0 loss for United. [...] Seven days later United suffered their first back-to-back defeats of the season as they crashed out of the FA Cup at the hands of Birmingham City. With {{the transfer}} window about to close Bramall Lane was relatively quite on deadline day; Danny Philliskirk was handed an extended deal, and striker Will Hoskins signed on loan from Brighton & Hove Albion until the end of the season, whilst youngster Erik Tønne was allowed to join Yorkshire neighbours York City, also until the end of the season. The club also gave a trial to experienced Scottish defender David Weir with a view to a potential short term contract.|$|E
