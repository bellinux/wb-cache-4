5|$|<b>Unfortunately,</b> other symptoms, such as ataxia, tremor or sensory losses, do {{not have}} proven treatments.|$|E
5|$|A single {{reference}} in {{the tomb of}} Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet indicates another campaign in Iamu {{in the land of}} Kehek. <b>Unfortunately,</b> the location of Kehek is unknown. It was long believed that Kehek was a reference to the Libyan tribe, Qeheq, and thus it was postulated that invaders from Libya took advantage of the death of Ahmose to move into the western Nile Delta. <b>Unfortunately</b> for this theory, the Qeheq people only appeared in later times, and Kehek's identity remains unknown. Nubia is a possibility, since Amenhotep did campaign there, and the western desert and the oases have also been suggested, since these seem to have fallen under Egyptian control once again.|$|E
5|$|Dating from 1177 to 1512, Rochester Cathedral has a Norman nave and crypt, and Early English choir. Its most {{remarkable}} {{feature is the}} rare, exuberantly carved Norman portal, which has, <b>unfortunately,</b> suffered much damage.|$|E
5|$|If {{the planet}} transits the star {{as seen from}} our direction, the radius should be measurable, albeit with some uncertainty. <b>Unfortunately,</b> {{measurements}} made with the Canadian-built MOST space telescope indicate that transits do not occur.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, Hansen {{was also}} charged with {{rebuilding}} Christiansborg Palace which had burnt down in 1794. <b>Unfortunately,</b> it burnt down {{once again in}} 1884. All that remains is the magnificent chapel which, with its Ionic columns, conveys a sense of antiquity.|$|E
5|$|Information {{concerning}} the soft anatomy of Amphidromus is widely scattered and fragmentary. The most complete account {{is that of}} Arnold Jacobi (1895) on specimens from Great Natuna (Natuna Islands) and Djemadja (Anamba Islands). <b>Unfortunately,</b> although {{it is clear that}} anatomical differences exist in the two species Jacobi dissected, <b>unfortunately</b> we do not know which forms he worked on, because he had incorrectly identified his material. In his paper he referred to the two species as Amphidromus chloris and the interruptus phase of A. perversus. However, that is not possible, because in reality Amphidromus chloris is a species found only in the Philippine Islands, and the interruptus phase of A. perversus is not present in the Natuna Islands.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{publishes a}} study which finds no {{bacteria}} in the human stomach. He concludes earlier discoveries were a result of contamination. <b>Unfortunately,</b> he chooses not to use a silver staining method, which will be later used to reveal H. pylori by Warren and Marshall.|$|E
5|$|Thrice's spring (2010) {{tour with}} Manchester Orchestra was <b>unfortunately</b> cut short on April 23 when Dustin Kensrue {{had to leave}} because of an illness in the family.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unfortunately,</b> {{having been}} {{preoccupied with the}} nerd situation, Homer is not {{prepared}} for his final exam. The nerds say {{the only way to}} pass is to cram for the final exam, which they help him do. However, despite Homer's best attempts, he gets an F. To Homer's delight, the nerds hack into the school's student records and change his grade to an A+, but <b>unfortunately,</b> Marge finds out and forces Homer to take the course again in order to set a good example for Bart and Lisa. Homer's next college experience is shown during the end credits, with college clichés such as hazing by a fraternity, phonebooth stuffing, a food fight, and finally his graduation ceremony where Homer flashes the audience.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unfortunately,</b> in the {{department}} of the Trans-Mississippi, problems with the distribution of the plentiful uniforms made in Houston and Shreveport meant that the South Western forces went without proper uniforms for some part of the war.|$|E
5|$|About 20 minutes later, Bariko {{launched}} a helicopter {{to check on}} the cable winch which was to collect samples. It also lowered boats to test radioactivity levels in the lagoon. B-17 pilotless drone aircraft were flown through the clouds, and a drone light tank was used to recover soil samples from the crater. <b>Unfortunately,</b> it became bogged and had to be towed out ten days later.|$|E
5|$|After Burgoyne's {{surrender}} on October 17, 1777 (part of {{the aftermath}} of the Saratoga Campaign), Ann Bleecker, her daughter and sister (all that remained of the family), and possibly a slave child returned to Tomhannock. <b>Unfortunately,</b> Caty Swits (1743–77) died during the return journey. Ann Bleecker was devastated by the loss of three generations of women in her family.|$|E
5|$|Baylor's passing offense {{had been}} strong all year. This {{was the first}} time they had been held below 21points in their last seven conference games and they had two wide {{receivers}} with over 50catches each. <b>Unfortunately</b> for the Bears, their starting quarterback Shawn Bell suffered a season-ending injury against Texas A on October 28.|$|E
5|$|Clumber Spaniels shed at {{a medium}} pace. Clumbers tend to drool {{because of their}} very droopy flews. Clumbers have minds of their own. Puppies are {{especially}} curious and playful. The breed has a trophy mentality and the dog has an incessant need to carry something most of the time; <b>unfortunately</b> {{this can lead to}} health issues as they may ingest the items.|$|E
5|$|In 1852 Staunton {{published}} his book The Chess Tournament, which recounted {{in detail the}} efforts required to make the London International Tournament happen and presented all the games with his comments on the play. <b>Unfortunately</b> some of Staunton's comments {{in the book and}} in The Illustrated London News were intemperate, because he was disappointed with the placing he achieved.|$|E
5|$|Lagenidium giganteum is a {{water-borne}} mould that parasitizes the {{larval stage}} of mosquitoes. When applied to water, the motile spores avoid unsuitable host species and search out suitable mosquito larval hosts. This alga has {{the advantages of}} a dormant phase, resistant to desiccation, with slow-release characteristics over several years. <b>Unfortunately,</b> it is susceptible to many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.|$|E
5|$|Myrtle Wilson– George's wife, and Tom Buchanan's mistress. Myrtle, who {{possesses}} a fierce vitality, is desperate to find refuge from her complacent marriage, but <b>unfortunately</b> {{this leads to}} her tragic ending. She is accidentally killed by Gatsby's car (driven by Daisy, though Gatsby insists {{he would take the}} blame for the accident).|$|E
5|$|Once {{again the}} Byzantines' {{military}} power was depleted and Andronicus III {{was forced into}} diplomacy as his grandfather was before him; {{in return for the}} safety of the remaining Byzantine settlements in Asia Minor, tribute would be paid to the Ottomans. <b>Unfortunately</b> for the Byzantine Empire, this did not stop the Ottomans from laying siege to Nicomedia in 1333; the city finally fell in 1337.|$|E
5|$|Over 400 souterrains {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Scotland, {{many of them in}} the south-east, and although few have been dated those that have suggest a construction date in the 2nd or 3rd centuries. <b>Unfortunately</b> the purpose of these small underground structures is also obscure. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|Pepys, Samuel (ed. Robert Latham and William Matthews, 1995). The Diary of Samuel Pepys. 11 volumes. London: Harper Collins. First {{published}} between 1970 and 1983, by Bell & Hyman, London. The shorthand {{in which}} Pepy's diaries were originally written was not accurately transcribed until this standard, and copyright, edition. All web {{versions of the}} diaries are based on public domain 19th-century editions, which <b>unfortunately</b> contain many errors.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{this story}} was simply content to show {{absolute}} power corrupting absolutely. <b>Unfortunately,</b> aside from Persis, none of the Augments stop {{to think about what}} they're doing or why, and the story of Malik is content to blandly repeat the story of Khan, but without the crucial personal motivator of revenge. I think the writers owed the material more than this.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern or Chinese spot-billed duck is {{currently}} introgressing into the mallard {{populations of the}} Primorsky Krai, possibly due to habitat changes from global warming. The Mariana mallard was a resident allopatric populationin most respects a good speciesapparently initially derived from mallard-Pacific black duck hybrids; <b>unfortunately,</b> it became extinct in the late 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage to}} {{specimens}} is <b>unfortunately</b> not reversible; however, the decay can be arrested by washing or soaking the specimens in water, {{followed by a}} very thorough drying. The specimens must then be placed {{in an environment that}} consists of only archival materials, in a completely archival setting.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, 2005–06, saw Humphreys {{become the}} first player to make 200 consecutive league appearances for Hartlepool. For this season Humphreys' moved to left back due to Hugh Robertson being injured. <b>Unfortunately</b> Hartlepool and Humphreys suffered relegation. Despite this Humphreys was named the Supporters and Players' Player of the Season as well as the North East Football Awards Football League Player of the Season.|$|E
5|$|The resort {{brought in}} some money, but Bowers {{was still in}} debt. The Bowers Mine was sold to pay off creditors, and she entered into {{negotiations}} with the newly created State of Nevada {{for the state to}} purchase the mansion as a psychiatric hospital. <b>Unfortunately</b> for Bowers, the deal fell through, and she was obliged to begin to sell her possessions to settle debts.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower and}} transepts were {{restored}} 1878–80 {{with a short}} spire similar to the original, but slated rather than oak-shingled. This work was done by Roderick Williams. The pulpit dates from this time. William Morris, {{on behalf of the}} Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, wrote to the vicar in 1877 asking for a less severe restoration. <b>Unfortunately</b> much had already been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{want and}} {{suffering}} produced {{by such a}} condition of the working classes is always an evil greatly to be deplored, but one, <b>unfortunately,</b> that cannot be reached by immediate legislation. The great and only remedy for unemployed labor, is the revival of business, and the encouragement of a judicious political system by which it will be brought about.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the first}} round she led the field in driving accuracy, was in the top 20 in greens in regulation, and was 84th out of 111 in driving distance. <b>Unfortunately,</b> poor putting (last in the field, {{averaging}} over a two-putt) cost her {{a spot on the}} first page of {{the first round}} leaderboard and ultimately caused her to miss the cut.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unfortunately</b> {{during the}} initial {{preparations}} for 2015 event it was realized that the Little Wittenham site was no longer suitable. The reason given was that the logistics had become more difficult over the previous few years, as the event had become more popular {{and the use of}} the land had changed. This was announced by the Rotary Club of Oxford Spires on 7 January 2015.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unfortunately</b> the Gloucestershire Hussars from Romani {{were not}} aware of Wiggin and his {{reinforcements}} on the other flank until it was too late, finally coming in sight of them at about 15:00. Wiggin had seen Yorke's force an hour earlier, but {{had not been able to}} communicate with it.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unfortunately,</b> Daley's theory—that it can {{be better}} to get a sum X immediately, rather than getting over many years a sum Y that is {{substantially}} larger than X—assumes something that cannot be assumed. It assumes that governments will prudently husband sudden surges of revenue from the lease or sale of assets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unfortunately,</b> Lois {{is given}} the welfare check by the mail lady and storms at Peter for lying to her. Peter decides to return {{the money to the}} taxpayers by dumping it from a blimp during Super Bowl XXXIII while Brian accompanies him. After the commotion they cause, they are {{immediately}} shot down.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unfortunately,</b> the Bears’ 2001 {{winning season}} would be {{followed}} by three years of mediocrity. Before the 2004 NFL season, the Bears’ organization fired coach Dick Jauron and then hired Lovie Smith. After starting the season on the lower rungs of the NFC North, Urlacher suffered several injuries that sidelined him {{for a majority of}} the season.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unfortunately</b> this {{reaction}} fails for higher alkenes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unfortunately</b> Nilsson's {{interpretation}} is not treated critically by later authors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unfortunately,</b> {{he did not}} get a {{game for}} the {{entirety}} of the season.|$|E
