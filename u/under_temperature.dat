[...] Newer machines, and the larger machines above 36 EM Matrix size typically used the more standardized 1/2 horsepower motor after v-belts came into common use in the 1930s. [...] The large machines also had the so-called 'double pot', with either larger gas burners, or else 2250 watt pot heaters and larger mouth and throat heaters. [...] The most modern Linotypes had the mouth and throat heaters thermostatically controlled, an improvement over the manual rheostat adjustment, or gas flame adjustment.|$|E

40|$|Broiler {{production}} {{is seen as}} critical to socio-economic development within the tropics. With the higher and rising temperatures of the tropics, heat stress is a major challenge of the industry. Of the many approaches used to alleviate heat stress, nutritional strategies {{have been seen as}} more economically viable in comparison to non- nutritional strategies used to alleviate heat stress. The current study was done to assess both the combined and specific impact of diet density (high fat versus low fat diets) and diet form (mash versus pelleted diets), on alleviating heat stress in broilers. Biological responses were monitored through growth performance and digestibility data. The experimental design used in the study was a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments from day 10 to day 34 of the trial period. Birds were subject to one of eight treatments which included a combination of one of two different temperatures (normal or elevated), one of two different diet types (high fat or low fat) and one of two different diet forms (mash or pellet). These treatments included Low Fat Mash <b>under</b> Normal <b>Temperature</b> conditions (LMN), Low Fat Mash <b>under</b> Elevated <b>Temperature</b> conditions (LME), Low Fat Pellet <b>under</b> Normal <b>Temperature</b> conditions (LPN), Low Fat Pellet <b>under</b> Elevated <b>Temperature</b> conditions (LPE), High Fat Mash <b>under</b> Normal <b>Temperature</b> conditions (HMN), High Fat Mash <b>under</b> Elevated <b>Temperature</b> conditions (HME), High Fat Pellet <b>under</b> Normal <b>Temperature</b> conditions (HPN) and High Fat Pellet <b>under</b> Elevated <b>Temperature</b> conditions (HPE).
