40|$|While it is {{acknowledged}} that system requirements {{will never be}} complete, incompleteness is often due to an inadequate process and methods for acquiring and tracking a representative set of requirements. Viewpoint development has been proposed to address these problems. We offer a viewpoint development approach that fits easily into the current practice of capturing requirements as <b>use</b> case <b>descriptions.</b> However, current practice does not support visualization of <b>use</b> case <b>descriptions,</b> the capture of multiple <b>use</b> case <b>descriptions,</b> the modeling of conflicts and the reconciliation of viewpoints. In our approach we apply techniques from natural language processing, term subsumption and set-theory to automatically convert the <b>use</b> case <b>descriptions</b> into a line diagram. The visualisation of <b>use</b> case <b>descriptions</b> is a natural addition to the object-oriented design of systems using the Unified Modelling Language where diagrams act as communication and validation devices. RECOCASE is a comprehensive methodology that includes <b>use</b> case <b>description</b> guidelines, a controlled language to support natural language translation, a requirements engineering process model and a tool to assist the specification and reconciliation of requirements.

40|$|Abstract. General action languages, like e. g. the Situation Calculus, use full {{classical}} logic to represent knowledge of actions {{and their effects}} in dynamic domains.

In this paper, we show how to <b>use</b> <b>Description</b> Logic as the basis for a decidable yet still expressive action formalism. To this end, we use ABoxes as decidable state descriptions in the basic Fluent Calculus. As a second contribution, we thus obtain an independent semantics – based on a general action formalism – for a recent method for ABox-Update. ...|$|E
