5|$|In {{front of}} Marlborough {{the rest of}} the van had mixed success. HMS Bellerophon and HMS Leviathan were both still {{suffering}} the effects of their exertions earlier in the week and did not breach the enemy line. Instead they pulled along the near side of Éole and America respectively and brought them to close gunnery duels. Rear-Admiral Thomas Pasley of Bellerophon was an early casualty, losing a leg in the opening exchanges. HMS Royal Sovereign, Graves's flagship, was less successful due to a miscalculation of distance that resulted in her pulling <b>up</b> <b>too</b> far from the French line and coming under heavy fire from her opponent Terrible. In the time it took to engage Terrible more closely, Royal Sovereign suffered a severe pounding and Admiral Graves was badly wounded.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the water jump — the final fence of the first circuit — that many riders became aware of the {{situation}} and pulled up, including champion jockey Peter Scudamore on Captain Dibble, Garrison Savannah, and Zeta's Lad, who was widely considered by tipsters as the form horse in the field, having raced unbeaten in his five starts that season, including beating Romany King in the Racing Post Chase at Kempton two months prior. Most of the horses at the rear were pulled <b>up</b> <b>too,</b> including Stay On Tracks, David's Duky, Direct, Mister Ed and the tailed-off Quirinus.|$|E

5|$|Minister of Local Government and Regional Development, Gunnar Berge, {{stated in}} January 1995 {{that he was}} {{concerned}} that the post-Olympic use funds were being used <b>up</b> <b>too</b> quickly and that money was being used for unsuitable projects. However, he rejected that the state should take control over the venues or the money. After one year, Lillehammer Olympiapark had used NOK32 of 146 million, while the company Olympia Utvikling/Troll Park had used NOK14 of 95 million. For the Lillehammer companies, {{this meant that the}} fund was estimated to run out after ten instead of twenty years. In contrast, Hamar Olympiske Anlegg had only used the fund's yield. LOOC criticized the post-Olympic use companies, stating that they were too bureaucratic, that their combined 100 employees were too many, and that one or two companies would be sufficient.|$|E
5|$|The party's ski boots, {{specially}} designed by Amundsen, were {{the product of}} two years' testing and modification in search of perfection. The party's polar clothing included suits of sealskin from Northern Greenland, and clothes fashioned after {{the style of the}} Netsilik Inuit from reindeer skins, wolf skin, Burberry cloth and gabardine. The sledges were constructed from Norwegian ash with steel-shod runners made from American hickory. Skis, also fashioned from hickory, were extra long to reduce the likelihood of slipping into crevasses. The tents—"the strongest and most practical that have ever been used"—had built-in floors and required a single pole. For cooking on the march, Amundsen chose the Swedish Primus stove rather than the special cooker devised by Nansen, because he felt the latter took <b>up</b> <b>too</b> much space.|$|E
5|$|When Kosovo {{was under}} the {{administration}} of the United Nations, the UN flag was flown in Kosovo. However, the flag used by the Kosovar Albanian population was the Albanian flag. The Albanian flag was also used on public buildings, even though it was against UN regulations. Regulations stated only the UN flag and other authorised flags, like those of cities, could fly on public buildings. If the Albanian flag did have to go up, then the Serbian flag must go <b>up</b> <b>too,</b> according to UN regulations. However, this was never done in practice and the flag of Albania was ever-present in Kosovo during the UNMIK period.|$|E

5|$|After nearly 40 {{years of}} service, Eichelberger retired with {{the rank of}} {{lieutenant}} general on 31 December 1948. In 1950, he moved to Asheville, North Carolina, where {{he lived with his}} wife Em {{for the rest of his}} life. He suffered from a number of health problems, including hypertension and diabetes, and had his gall bladder removed. His name appeared in a series of articles for the Saturday Evening Post on his campaigns in the Southwest Pacific, actually written by ghostwriter Milton MacKaye. They subsequently expanded the articles into a book, Our Jungle Road to Tokyo. The book sold reasonably well, and Harry Truman and Omar Bradley requested autographed copies. In 1951 he traveled to Hollywood, where he served as technical consultant on Francis Goes to West Point (1952) and The Day the Band Played (1952), but he was not altogether happy with the results. He turned his hand to writing articles about the Far East for Newsweek, but gave this away in 1954. He then worked on the lecture circuit, giving speeches about his experiences, but gave this <b>up</b> <b>too</b> in 1955. He campaigned for Richard Nixon in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come <b>up</b> <b>too</b> early and have to go back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.|$|E
5|$|Miles of Plancy briefly {{held the}} regency for the underaged Baldwin IV. Miles {{was assassinated in}} October 1174, and Raymond III was soon {{appointed}} to replace him. Raymond named William chancellor of Jerusalem, as well as archdeacon of Nazareth, and on 6 June 1175, William was elected archbishop of Tyre to replace Frederick de la Roche, {{who had died in}} October 1174. William's duties as chancellor probably did not take <b>up</b> <b>too</b> much of his time; the scribes and officials in the chancery drafted documents and it may not have even been necessary for him to be present to sign them. Instead he focused on his duties as archbishop. In 1177 he performed the funeral services for William of Montferrat, husband of Baldwin IV's sister Sibylla, when the patriarch of Jerusalem, Amalric of Nesle, was too sick to attend.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} {{as part of}} his promise to Bhuvan, Lakha takes a diving one-handed catch. However, the British score almost 300 runs, losing only three wickets by the lunch break. Kachra is brought back to bowl and, bowling with a now-worn ball, takes a hat-trick, which sparks the {{collapse}} of the British batting side. The villagers soon start their innings. Bhuvan and Deva (a Sikh, who has played cricket earlier when he was a British sepoy) give their team a solid start. Deva misses out on his half-century when a straight-drive from Bhuvan ricochets off the bowler's hand onto the stumps at the non-striker's end, where Deva is backing <b>up</b> <b>too</b> far. When Lakha comes on to bat, he is hit on the head by a bouncer and falls onto his stumps. Other batsmen get out rashly trying to score a boundary off each delivery. Ismail (Raj Zutshi), a good batsman, retires hurt as he is hit on the leg. The villagers' team ends the day with four batsmen out of action with barely a third of the required runs on board.|$|E
5|$|The race {{organizers}} performed anti-doping controls {{throughout the}} race. Riders would be selected after a stage and have thirty {{minutes to get}} tested. The results generally would be returned between thirty and sixty minutes later. No rider tested positive in this edition of the Giro, but had this happened, the following penalties would have been applied: the rider would be demoted to last place of the stage, given a ten-minute penalty in the general classification, a lengthy suspension, and a fine of one thousand francs. Although no riders tested positive, Roberto Visentini, Flavio Giuppioni and Urs Zimmermann – who placed second, third and fourth, respectively, in the eighteenth stage – showed <b>up</b> <b>too</b> late for their control tests and were given the penalties corresponding to riders testing positive; after complaints and threats to leave the race from their team leaders, the jury later reverted their decision, and no penalty was given.|$|E
5|$|Two days late, the {{parachute}} infantry battalions of Stanisław Sosabowski's 1st (Polish) Parachute Brigade {{were able to}} take off in England. 114 C-47s took off but 41 aircraft turned back after Troop Carrier Command decided it would be too dangerous to land if the aircraft were <b>up</b> <b>too</b> long. The remainder pressed on; they did not have the correct transmission codes and did not understand the messages. One of the few messages to get out of Arnhem warned the Poles that DZ 'K' was not secure and to land instead on the polder east of Driel where they should secure the Heveadorp ferry on the south bank of the Rhine. The Poles dropped under fire at 17:00 and sustained casualties but assembled in good order. Advancing to the river bank, they discovered that the ferry was gone; the ferryman had sunk it to deny its use to the Germans.|$|E

5|$|Rise of Mana was {{intended}} to reach a wide audience, gaining an attention only previously seen by Dawn of Mana in 2006. The concept of the main character switching between angelic and demonic form was suggested by Yagi. The original concept was to keep both characters in separate bodies, with the unoccupied character being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The team used the Photon Server middleware to develop the game's multiplayer component. The development team initially thought of creating custom middleware, but the rebuild needed {{would have taken a}} whole year, threatening the project's existence. In search of suitable middleware, the team contacted Fixer, who offered them the use of multiple options including Photon Server. Trying out Photon Server, all the problems faced by the developers were resolved within a two-month period, and the middleware's inbuilt security structure and specification match with the game persuaded the project's engineers to greenlight its use. Rise of Mana was the first Japanese game to use Photon Server. The team needed to create two different specifications for iOS and Android, as Android had higher graphical power. During the early development stage, the team {{thought it would be fun}} to re-create the multiplayer elements in Secret of Mana. The initial idea was to have multiplayer available in standard quests, but this took <b>up</b> <b>too</b> much operational space to be practical, so they reduced this to raid battles. Due to the use of Photon Server, additional player characters could be fully rendered rather than appearing as ghost-like transparent helpers.|$|E
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going <b>up</b> <b>too</b> steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E
