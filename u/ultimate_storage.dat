The method is aimed at routing sediment in morphologically diverse bedrock-controlled channels in which sediment transport and storage is not a continuous process {{in space and time}} and mostly occurs in response to discrete discharges. The relative value of the ultimate stable scour depth (Huss) for each steady discharge with respect to the current scour depth after adding sediment supply determines the potential to scour or store sediment. Scour depths measured at discrete locations along the longitudinal profile of a laboratory pool at discrete times until changes in scour were not discernible for each steady discharge and sediment size have been integrated to provide the Huss and storage depletion curve. The experimentally established dependence of scour depth on critical flow depth, settling velocity and sediment supply formed the basis of generating dimensionless Huss and storage depletion curve from these parameters using the Buckingham π theorem. The optimization of experimental results to generate the storage depletion curve gave the exponent of time (φ) and the exponential decay factor (k) as 0. 5 and 0. 0040207 respectively.

The mechanism of iron uptake and storage was analyzed in this noncanonical ferritin by three high-resolution structures at successively increasing iron contents. In the high-iron state of the DpsA protein, up to 110 iron atoms were localized in the dodecameric protein complex. For <b>ultimate</b> iron <b>storage,</b> the archaeal ferritin shell comprises iron-binding sites for iron translocation, oxidation, and nucleation.

This narrow pore permits translocation of ions toward the ferroxidase centers via two discrete steps. Iron oxidation proceeds by transient formation of tri-iron ferroxidase centers. Iron storage by biomineralization inside the ferritin shell occurs at two iron nucleation centers. Here, a single iron atom provides a structural seed for iron-oxide cluster formation.

The molecular weight of PEG was systematically varied to include 10, 20, and 35 kDa while the mole ratio of PEG to POSS diol (as chain extender) was chosen as 8 : 1.

40|$|The petrophysical {{properties}} of cap rocks and intraformational barriers can constrain {{the carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) containment volumes of potential geosequestration sites. Characterisation of regional seals and intraformational barriers requires {{an understanding of the}} seal capacity of the cap rock or barrier. Seal capacity is the capillary pressure (or column height) at which a trapped fl uid commences to leak through a seal rock. Seal rocks are effective due to very fi ne pore and pore-throat sizes that result in low porosities and permeabilities. These in turn generate high capillary threshold pressures. High threshold pressures, together with wettability and interfacial tension (IFT) properties determine the fi nal column height that a seal can hold. Wettability and IFT {{play an important role in}} the geological storage of CO 2 through their effect on seal capacity (CO 2 column height) with respect to capillary pressure, thereby controlling the potential for the movement of CO 2 through the seal and affecting <b>ultimate</b> reservoir <b>storage</b> volumes. Mercury injection capillary pressure analysis has been used extensively in the petroleum industry to determine the effectiveness of the top seal in relation to hydrocarbon column height retention. With the burgeoning interest in geological storage of CO 2, this technology can be applied to establish the suitability of a top seal for containment of CO 2; however, the role of IFT and wettability in the CO 2 -water-rock systems is not well understood. It is unclear how supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2) affects these two properties, particularly as the water front becomes saturated with scCO 2 and eventually becomes miscible with the scCO 2 at high pressure reservoir conditions. Selected examples of top and intraformational seals from the Bowen, Otway, Gippsland and Cooper basins are discussed in light of new experimental evidence on wettability and IFT variations in the CO 2 -water-rock system. These variations may be more signifi cant than in hydrocarbon-water-rock systems and based on non-wetting assumptions, the calculated CO 2 column heights may be signifi cantly different than previously predicted.

The first of these was rolled out in March 1980 and flew {{for the first time in}} July, and was intended to test the flight characteristics, with the second airframe planned to carry out trials on the Mission Systems Avionics (MSA) package. The MSA was based around a GEC 4080M computer, which was required to process data from the two radar scanners, the ESM system, IFF and inertial navigation systems. The integration of all of these systems into a single package proved too difficult for the underpowered computer, which had an <b>ultimate</b> data <b>storage</b> capacity of 2.4 MB. Additionally, when operating at full power the radar scanners and on-board electronic systems generated a significant amount of heat. A system was developed to channel this via the fuel system, from where it could then dissipate, but which only worked when the fuel tanks were at least half full.Despite the problems, the Nimrod was persevered with, and 8 production aircraft were ordered (which would also come from spare MR1 airframes), with the first of these flying in March 1982. Even while the technical problems were being worked on, the aircraft was delivered to the RAF, with No 8 Squadron, the RAF's AEW squadron which at that time operated the Shackleton, receiving its first in 1984 to begin crew training.

In this study, FePt and FePt/Cu bilayers have been sputter deposited at room temperature onto thermally oxidized silicon wafers, glass substrates and self-assembled arrays of spherical SiO 2 particles with diameters down to 10 nm. Millisecond flash lamp annealing, as well as conventional rapid thermal annealing was employed to induce the phase transformation from the chemically disordered A 1 phase into the chemically ordered L 10 phase. The influence of the annealing temperature, annealing time and the film thickness on the ordering transformation and (001) texture evolution of FePt films with near equiatomic composition was studied. Whereas flash lamp annealed FePt films exhibit a polycrystalline morphology with high chemical L 10 order, rapid thermal annealing can lead to the formation of chemically ordered FePt fifilms with (001) texture on amorphous SiO 2 /Si substrates. The resultant high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and large coercivities up to 40 kOe are demonstrated. Simultaneuosly to the ordering transformation, rapid thermal annealing to temperatures exceeding 600 °C leads to a break up of the continuous FePt film into separated islands.

This report is the documentation of the preliminary design work for the NSLS-II facility. The preliminary design of the Accelerator Systems (Part 1) was developed mostly based of the Conceptual Design Report, except for the Booster design, which was changed from in-storage-ring tunnel configuration to in external- tunnel configuration. The design of beamlines (Part 2) is based on designs developed by engineering firms {{in accordance with the}} specification provided by the Project. The conventional facility design (Part 3) is the Title 1 preliminary design by the AE firm that met the NSLS-II requirements. Last and very important, Part 4 documents the ES&H design and considerations related to this preliminary design. The NSLS-II performance goals are motivated by the recognition that major advances in many important technology problems will require scientific breakthroughs in developing new materials with advanced properties. Achieving this will require the development of new tools that will enable the characterization of the atomic and electronic structure, chemical composition, and magnetic properties of materials, at nanoscale resolution. These tools must be nondestructive, to image and characterize buried structures and interfaces, and they must operate {{in a wide range of}} temperatures and harsh environments. The NSLS-II facility will provide ultra high brightness and flux and exceptional beam stability. It will also provide advanced insertion devices, optics, detectors, and robotics, and a suite of scientific instruments designed to maximize the scientific output of the facility. Together these will enable the study of material properties and functions with a spatial resolution of {approx} 1 nm, an energy resolution of {approx} 0. 1 meV, and the ultra high sensitivity required to perform spectroscopy on a single atom. In order to meet this need, NSLS-II has been designed to provide world-leading brightness and flux and exceptional beam stability. The brightness is defined as the number of photons emitted per second, per photon energy bandwidth, per solid angle, and per unit source size. Brightness is important because it determines how efficiently an intense flux of photons can be refocused to a small spot size and a small divergence. It scales as the ring current and the number of total periods of the undulator field (both of which contribute linearly to the total flux), as well as eing nversely proportional to the horizontal and vertical emittances (the product of beam size and divergence) of the electron beam. Raising the current in the storage ring to obtain even brighter beams is ultimately limited by beam-driven, collective instabilities in the accelerator. Thus, to maximize the brightness, the horizontal and vertical emittances must be made as small as possible. With the concept of using damping wigglers, low-field bending magnets, and a large number of lattice cells to achieve ultra small emittance, the performance of NSLS-II will be nearly at the <b>ultimate</b> limit of <b>storage</b> ring light sources, set by the intrinsic properties of the synchrotron radiation process. The facility will produce x-rays more than 10, 000 times brighter than those produced at NSLS today. The facility, with various insertion devices, including three-pole-wigglers and low-field dipole radiations, has the capability of covering a broad range of radiation spectra, from hard x-ray to far infra-red. The superlative character and combination of capabilities will have broad impact on a wide range of disciplines and scientific initiatives in the coming decades, including new studies of small crystals in structural biology, a wide range of nanometer-resolution probes for nanoscience, coherent imaging of the structure and dynamics of disordered materials, greatly increased applicability of inelastic x-ray scattering, and properties of materials under extreme conditions. Commissioned in 1982, the existing National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) provides essential scientific tools for 2, 300 scientists per year from more than 400 academic, industrial, and government institutions. Their myriad research programs produce about 800 publications per year, with more than 130 appearing in premier journals. It was designed in the 1970 s and is now in its third decade of service. It has been continually upgraded over the years, with the brightness increasing fully five orders of magnitude. However, it has reached the theoretical limits of performance given its small circumference and small periodicity, and only a small number of insertion devices are possible...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{contains}} {{studies of}} animal life histories at high latitudes. Several topics are covered; from ecosystem consequences of life histories to tests of specific behavioural predictions put forward based on life history arguments. Work on complete life histories is {{also included in}} an attempt to understand the evolution of capital and income breeding in marine copepods. My main research questions, followed by main topics and findings, are as follows: • How are seasonal environments influencing life history traits and phenology? • What are the roles of storage as a reproductive adaptation? • How are individual states, particularly energy reserves, influencing optimal life histories and behaviour? Paper 1 deals with how growth of a high-latitude pelagic fish, the Norwegian spring-spawning herring, is scheduled during the annual cycle. Body mass data reveal a short period of rapid annual increase in body mass at the time when the copepod Calanus finmarchicus is the main prey. The food consumption (energy units) of the entire herring population is estimated, using a bioenergetics model, and compared with production estimates of C. finmarchicus. Large herring populations, particularly because of their selective predation on older stages, can influence population dynamics of C. finmarchicus, and may explain some of the copepod’s life history adaptations. Finally, estimates of spatial energy transport are presented; caused by herring migrating from oceanic feeding grounds to coastal overwintering and spawning sites. The large herring stock may be responsible for the world’s largest biomass transport caused by a migrating population. This flux of energy and nutrients is important for coastal species, and potentially for interactions not yet studied, such as between herring eggs and benthic invertebrates. Paper 2 is a short comment on recent studies of copepod life cycles that have suggested that the large lipid stores serve as a means of obtaining neutral buoyancy at a given depth - an ultimate explanation of energy stores. There is, however, a need to understand the use of energy reserves remaining after the winter, before we understand the <b>ultimate</b> explanation for <b>storage.</b> That is, we must study to what degree copepods are capital breeders (using energy reserves for egg production) as opposed to income breeders (relying on concurrent food intake for egg production). These ideas were pursued in papers 3 and 4 which are based on a life history model of the abundant Southern Ocean copepod Calanoides acutus. Life history tradeoffs arise in the model because bioenergetics, developmental constraints, and interactions with the environment (temperature, food availability and predation risk) are made explicit. Hence, trade offs need not be assumed. The model is statedependent and reproductive value of individuals with different developmental stage and condition is predicted by dynamic programming. The model predicts the optimal energy allocation and diapause strategies that maximise reproductive value at any time of the year, determining the entire life history strategy. A highly seasonal pattern in optimal egg-laying time is predicted. This optimality is, however, seen from an egg’s perspective. Actual egg production, as predicted from population simulations, do not match the seasonal peak in offspring fitness, which suggest that later life cycle stages are subject to trade-offs and constraints causing laying dates sub-optimal from the offspring’s perspective. Mechanism behind the mismatch are studied. Eggs from capital breeding have higher fitness than income bred eggs as capital breeding takes place early in the season, even before the phytoplankton bloom. The time an egg is produced influences its probability of: 1) reaching a stage capable of diapause; 2) developing large energy reserves, and; 3) developing to a stage capable of capital breeding next season. We conclude that seasonality in both growth potential and predation risk are key drivers of copepod life histories. Paper 5 is on {{the costs and benefits of}} capital breeding in aquatic environments, including ecosystem consequence that follow from capital breeding strategies such as the lipid transport of herring. Costs and benefits of carrying energy reserves are different for aquatic compared to terrestrial organisms. General analyses of the costs and benefits of capital breeding would improve by incorporating more of the findings from studies of marine organisms. Marine biologists, on the other hand, may better understand and appreciate the life history trade-offs of their study organism if theoretical concepts from the predominantly terrestrial literature were used more actively. Quantification of pre-breeding costs of a capital breeder strategy is one such issue. These costs may influence how we understand life cycle questions such as timing of diapause and other state-dependent decisions prior to breeding. Paper 6 is on a long lived seabird whose reproductive strategy includes sophisticated parental care. State-dependent behavioural responses are studied, and as in the papers above, an important state is body condition in terms of stored resources. The petrels are found to adjust chick feeding and guarding according to their own body condition, the body condition of their partner with whom they co-ordinate the chick-rearing period, and finally, adjustments in response to the chick’s needs for food and guarding. All these factors are found to play a role in determining individual behaviour. The results are obtained using a field experiment, and are discussed in relation to the life history strategies of seabirds...|$|R
