40|$|One {{can view}} {{the law of}} {{creditors}} 2 ̆ 7 rights {{as a series of}} cyclesin which alternatively the rights of the creditor and then those of the debtor are in ascendancy. Looking back through Americanlegislative history, one sees both the state legislatures and the Congress intervening on behalf of debtors {{in a variety of ways}} onmany occasions. An early example of such intervention was the enactment, particularly in the Midwest and West, of generous exemption laws that removed a variety of property beyond the reach of general creditors. A second example is the enactment of usury laws, which continue to be a substantial restriction on the rates that creditors can charge to consumer debtors. Other examples are laws giving mortgagors rights to redeem property after foreclosures and laws providing for <b>upset</b> <b>prices</b> at foreclosure sales. These legislative attempts to protect certain debtor interests often have been frustrated by the clever devices ofcreditors 2 ̆ 7 lawyers. Thus, some of the restrictions on foreclosure and redemption periods were met by deeds of trust with explicit powers to sell. Usury laws have been circumvented by the advocacy of the time-price doctrine and by the substitution of a variety of fees and charges in lieu of interest.

60|$|For {{two days}} before the {{appointed}} day for the sale of the lands and estate of Ellangowan, Mac-Morlan daily expected the appearance of Colonel Mannering, or at least a letter containing powers to act for him. But none such arrived. Mr. Mac-Morlan waked early in the morning, walked over to the Post-office,--there were no letters for him. He endeavoured to persuade himself that he should see Colonel Mannering to breakfast, and ordered his wife to place her best china and prepare herself accordingly. But the preparations were in vain. 'Could I have foreseen this,' he said, 'I would have travelled Scotland over, but I would have found some one to bid against Glossin.' Alas! such reflections were all too late. The appointed hour arrived; and the parties met in the Masons' Lodge at Kippletringan, being the place fixed for the adjourned sale. Mac-Morlan spent as much time in preliminaries as decency would permit, and read over the articles of sale as slowly {{as if he had been}} reading his own death-warrant. He turned his eye every time the door of the room opened, with hopes which grew fainter and fainter. He listened to every noise in the street of the village, and endeavoured to distinguish in it the sound of hoofs or wheels. It was all in vain. A bright idea then occurred, that Colonel Mannering might have employed some other person in the transaction; he would not have wasted a moment's thought upon the want of confidence in himself which such a manoeuvre would have evinced. But this hope also was groundless. After a solemn pause, Mr. Glossin offered the <b>upset</b> <b>price</b> for the lands and barony of Ellangowan. No reply was made, and no competitor appeared; so, after a lapse of the usual interval by the running of a sand-glass, upon the intended purchaser entering the proper sureties, Mr. Mac-Morlan was obliged, in technical terms, to 'find and declare the sale lawfully completed, and to prefer the said Gilbert Glossin as the purchaser of the said lands and estate.' The honest writer refused to partake of a splendid entertainment with which Gilbert Glossin, Esquire, now of Ellangowan, treated the rest of the company, and returned home in huge bitterness of spirit, which he vented in complaints against the fickleness and caprice of these Indian nabobs, who never knew what they would be at for ten days together. Fortune generously determined to take the blame upon herself, and cut off even this vent of Mac-Morlan's resentment.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} element of timber auctions is the upset—the minimum acceptable price, often called the reserve price in other auction environments. The upset has three main purposes: (1) to guarantee substantial revenue in auctions where competition is weak but the upset is met, (2) to limit the incentive for—and the impact of—collusive bidding, and (3) to provide useful information to bidders. We analyze {{the determination of the}} upset in British Columbia timber auctions. Setting the upset too high results in unsold stands and produces an upward bias in price if the competitive auctions are used to determine stumpage rates for non-auctioned timber. Setting the upset too low will reduce auction revenue and can create downward bias when the auction prices are used to calculate timber prices for non-auctioned stands. It is therefore important to set the upset at or near the optimal level. We present the theory of <b>upset</b> <b>pricing</b> and then apply that theory to the data available from historical timber auction sales in the BC Interior from 1999 to 2000. We find that an upset of about 70 percent (a rollback of 30 percent) maximizes auction revenues if the Ministry values timber at about 52 to 56 percent of its appraised value. This upset strikes the right balance between enhanced revenues and unsold timber stands. Given its importance, this upset calibration should be refined as additional data becomes available to assure that the upset is not set too high or too low...|$|R

40|$|Ownership {{rates have}} been {{decreasing}} since 2004, and the rental market is becoming less affordable each day. A rent-to-own agreement would reduce barriers to purchase a property for future buyers. However, to promote this type of contract {{it is necessary to}} demonstrate that investors will be exposed to lower risk, or higher returns, than in a traditional lease. Since taxes {{are an important part of}} a real estate investment, this thesis analyzed if this risk can be mitigated by passing the taxes to the tenants. While rents and prices respond to market conditions, property taxes do not show a clear trend of how they change, leaving investors exposed to a high risk. In addition, property taxes significantly differ among states since they vary with the financial needs of each local government. Moreover, the effective tax rate can also differ from town to town, and even within the city because of the different tax districts in which the property is located and the No Ad Valorem taxes. The evolution of taxes, prices and rent in Massachusetts, and within the cities of Arlington, Newton and Wellesley is explored in this thesis to understand how property taxes evolve over the years and see if changes in rent and/or <b>prices</b> <b>upset</b> variations in taxes. In addition, this thesis also considers the evolution of these variables in Larimer County, Colorado, and in Oak Park, Illinois. Moreover, this thesis analyzed the potential return of a residential property in each of the cities studied to establish if there is any financial advantage for signing in a RTO agreement instead of a traditional lease, and if capping the taxes would reduce the financial risk. The data shows that in cities that saw a high appreciation or rental growth singing a rent-to-own contract was not the best alternative for investors since their return would have been lower. In addition, passing the taxes is not attractive enough to investors since the additional points that this procedure offers are not significant, and in some case, when taxes decrease, they actually decrease the investor's return. by Lina M.
