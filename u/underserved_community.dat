40|$|This article critiques {{the idea}} that the private sector can take the lead in {{addressing}} the capital needs of <b>underserved</b> <b>communities,</b> focusing specifically on the emerging domestic markets approach advocated by Milken Institute researchers. This approach has three limitations. First, it treats all <b>underserved</b> <b>communities</b> as interchangeable, ignoring that they differ in important ways in the nature and causes of their capital constraints. Second, it claims that <b>underserved</b> <b>communities</b> lack access to capital primarily as a result of information failure, overlooking numerous other obstacles that discourage investment in such communities. Third, its overarching assumption that the private sector can take the lead in meeting the capital needs of <b>underserved</b> <b>communities</b> is unrealistic because it fails to address these additional barriers to investment. The article recommends a more individualized approach to understanding the capital needs of <b>underserved</b> <b>communities</b> and recognition of the need for public sector leadership in solving this problem. access to capital; emerging domestic markets; Michael Porter; underserved communities; venture capital...|$|R

He has teamed with numerous non-profits over the years to garner support for issues such as AIDS/HIV Awareness, LBGT Equal Rights, children’s art education, <b>underserved</b> <b>community</b> development and foreign relief efforts. In 2010, Miles partnered with The Remedee Foundation in effort to bring art, film, and technology together for youth education in underserved communities around the world. In January 2011, with the support from Intel and Adobe, and in conjunction with Art Technology Labs, [...] Miles’ 3D Art Project made its debut exhibiting at CES inside the famed Intel Booth. Listed as one of the top 5 uses of 3D at CES by the International Business Times, the project is a one-of-a-kind artistic collaboration using original works from renowned artist Miles Regis and art technology visionary, Brian Quandt. Utilizing leading edge technologies including 2D-3D conversion, glasses-free viewing and more, the 3D Art Project offers viewers a never-before seen art experience. As a viewer sees the layers within the paintings at varying depths in 3D, he/she is also witnessing the chronological and emotional progression of the artwork as it was being made - the beginning of the painting furthest from the viewer, and each additional layer on planes closer to the viewer.The duo continued their 3D collaboration with Intel at the 2011 Coachella Music Festival. For the Coachella Valley Music And Art Festival and its 80,000 attendees, Miles created new canvas rendered to 3D. The work was entitled, “The Music Peace.” The work was part of the kick-off for an international tour with the Creators Project, a collaborative effort between Intel and Vice, celebrating art, music, and culture. [...] For 2011, the Creator's Project toured Beijing, Seoul, Lyon, Paris, São Paulo, and New York.|$|E
40|$|The role {{of women}} as an <b>underserved</b> <b>community</b> {{in the world of}} {{information}} technology (IT) is both unique and perplexing. In this paper we consider the question of women as an <b>underserved</b> <b>community</b> in IT, and in particular, their role as producers of IT. In order to better understand the ways in which women do and do not represent a coherent <b>underserved</b> <b>community</b> within the IT profession, the research question motivating this paper is: Do women vary with respect to the factors that help to explain the underrepresentation of women in the IT profession and, if so, how? In order to address this question, we draw on data from a multi-year qualitative investigation of the underrepresentation of women in the U. S. IT profession. In doing so, we investigate gender discourses with respect to: domestic responsibilities, career opportunities and IT as a masculine domain. We also demonstrate the range of responses to these discourses. This research contributes to an understanding of socio-cultural factors that serve as barriers to and facilitators of women’s recruitment and retention in the IT profession and to the factors that have enabled some women to overcome these barriers...|$|E
