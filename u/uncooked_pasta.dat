25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. <b>Uncooked</b> <b>pasta</b> is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E

5000|$|Boxed mixes {{consist of}} <b>uncooked</b> <b>pasta</b> and either a liquid cheese sauce (often labeled [...] "deluxe") or {{powdered}} ingredients to prepare it. The powdered cheese sauce {{is mixed with}} either milk or water, and margarine, butter, or olive oil and added to the cooked noodles. Some mixes prepared in a microwave cook the pasta in the sauce.|$|E
40|$|Rice {{is one of}} the few cereal {{products}} that does not contain gluten. However, the absence of gluten poses problems in the structure of and cooking quality of rice pasta. The objective of this project was to investigate the addition of starch on the physicochemical properties and cooking quality of rice-based pasta. Rice-based pasta was prepared from parboiled long-grain rice flour with the addition of 25 % cooked starch from different sources. The color and pasting properties of the ground pasta flour were measured by a chroma meter and a Rapid Visco Analyser, respectively. The pasta was cooked to the optimum cooking time to evaluate its hardness, stickiness, adhesiveness and resilience by using texture profile analysis with a texture analyzer. The water absorption and cooking loss of pasta were determined by weight difference. Overall the addition of starch improved the processibility of rice pasta and enabled the b* value (yellow color) of the <b>uncooked</b> rice <b>pasta</b> to be close to that of the semolina control. The pasting properties of rice pasta containing common corn starch were close to those of the semolina control. Upon cooking, the rice flour control had higher water absorption and greater cooking loss than the semolina control. The addition of starch decreased both the water absorption and the cooking loss relative to the rice flour control. The effect of starch addition on the textural properties of rice-based pasta varied with the type of starch. The addition of waxy starch or tapioca starch resulted in rice pasta with an increase in hardness and stickiness, whereas the addition of common corn, Hylon V, or Hylon VII resulted in rice pasta with a decrease in hardness, stickiness, and adhesiveness. This project demonstrates that the addition of starch significantly changes the color, pasting, cooking and texture properties of rice pasta, and these changes are governed by the type of starch incorporated into the rice pasta. Gluten-free rice pasta can be prepared with properties similar to the semolina pasta by incorporating starches...|$|R

40|$|A rehydratable {{dry-film}} plating {{method for}} coliforms in foods, the 3 MTM PetrifilmTM Rapid Coliform Count plate method, was {{compared with the}} U. S. Food and Drug Administration’s Bacterio-logical Analytical Manual method for nondairy foods and the American Public Health Associa-tion’s Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products (SMEDP) method for dairy foods. Six food types, vanilla ice cream, cheddar cheese, fresh refrigerated <b>uncooked</b> <b>pasta,</b> wheat flour, prepared frozen macaroni and cheese, and frozen hash browns, were analyzed for coliforms by 11 collaborating laboratories. For each food prod-uct tested, the collaborators received 8 blind sam-ples consisting of a control sample and 3 levels of inoculated sample, each in duplicate. The mean log counts for the methods were comparable. The re-peatability and reproducibility variances of the Petrifilm Rapid Coliform Count method at 14 and 24 h {{were not significantly different}} from those of the standard methods...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{durum wheat}} (Triticum durum desf.) {{semolina}} was fractionated into starch, gluten, and water extractables. Starch surface proteins and surface lipids were removed, and two starches with manipulated granule size distributions were produced to influence starch properties, affecting its interaction with other semolina components. Reconstituted spaghetti {{was made with}} untreated (control) or treated starches. The pasta made from the starting semolina material had lower cooking time and was of lower quality than the samples made from reconstituted material. This was not due to changes in gluten properties {{as a result of}} the first step of the fractionation process. For the reconstituted samples, starch interaction behavior was not changed after surface protein or surface lipid removal. Starch surface properties thus do not influence the starch interaction behavior, indicating that starch-gluten interaction in raw (<b>uncooked)</b> <b>pasta</b> is mainly due to physical inclusion. All reconstituted pasta samples also had generally the same cooking quality. It was concluded that the small changes in starch gelatinization behavior, caused by the above;mentioned starch modifications, are of little importance for pasta quality. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{hydrothermal}} treatment on the pasting, hydration properties and colour quality of commercial fresh pasta were studied following an Instantaneous Controlled Pressure Drop treatment. This hydrothermal procedure involves a physical modification at high temperature (< 144 °C) and restricted moisture content (< 30 %) during {{a very short}} time (15 – 40 s) followed by a rapid pressure drop to a vacuum (50 mbar). Two process variables (steam pressure level and processing time) were investigated using response surface methodology. Steam pressure level had the greatest effect on hydration and pasting parameters. Increased pressure resulted in elevation of mass ratio between cooked and <b>uncooked</b> <b>pasta</b> (Wi/W 0) 100 °C and reduction of for all treated pasta. The optimum cooking time of untreated pasta was 7 min (W/W 0 = 2. 4), whereas for the same ratio it was less than 1 min for pasta treated at pressures ranging between 2. 5 and 3. 5 bar. The viscosity at 10 min (V 10) increased linearly when the pressure level increased. V 10 was 146 cP for untreated pasta whereas it reached 2659 cP for pasta treated at 3. 9 bar (144 °C) for 25 s. The cold paste viscosity and setback viscosity decreased when the pressure varied from 1 to 3. 9 bar...|$|E
40|$|Eva loved {{science and}} {{mathematics}} {{as a child and}} her parents were delighted byher excitement and aptitude. When she was four, she asked her mother how long it was until her birthday and her mother replied, “Two months. ” She immediately asked, “How much is eight times seven? ” Her mother answered, “Fifty-six. Why do you want to know? ” Eva replied, “I want to know how many days until my birthday. ” Eva’s favorite activities included taking apart radios, clocks, and old appliances and then trying to put them back together. She loved to build with many different kinds of materials—everything from blocks and Lego toys to materials she found in the kitchen, such as marshmallows, <b>uncooked</b> <b>pasta,</b> and cans and boxes of food. She also loved computer work, especially mathematics programs, and routinely request-ed these types of gifts while most of her friends were asking for Barbie dolls. Unfortunately, Eva’s interests and talents in mathematics began to fade in ele-mentary school. By the third grade, she had stopped wanting to do mathematics at home and repeatedly told her parents that “school ” mathematics was boring. Because of her attitude and her lack of interest in doing mathematics homework at home, she had fallen behind in memorizing her multiplication tables and was no...|$|E
