Currently, the <b>UNECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> <b>No</b> 107 at its revision 5 has included general provisions for the accessibility and basic safety {{for this type of}} users. An applied research has been performed to analyze the level of protection offered for the stroller restraint systems included in R 107, by performing dynamic tests with instrumented dummies. More than 20 dynamic sled tests were performed to assess the child safety in urban buses. Two types of configurations have been tested: a vehicle specific CRS for urban buses and the own stroller with different restraint systems. The specific vehicle built-in CRS tested is a rearward facing group 0 /I that is currently in use in the city of Madrid (Spain) by the public urban buses. This CRS was tested in frontal and rear impact with the acceleration pulse defined in the <b>UNECE</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>No</b> 80. On the other hand, to make suggestions for using the stroller in urban buses, a very low severity crash pulse (up to 2 g peak acceleration and AV = 20 km/h) was defined and used in this study. Four stroller models with three types of restraint devices (safety belt, PRM wheelchair backrest and a folding backrest device) were tested with this pulse. The strollers were selected in order to reduce biasing of the results. Several dummies (P 3, Q 3 and Q 1) were used to evaluate the injuries and the kinematics. Furthermore, different sources of IRAV have been applied for the Q dummies (R 94 and FMVSS 208 scaled by applying Mertz 2003 techniques), an extended range of injury criteria is obtained and an in depth analysis of the protection offered by the different restraints systems used is performed...|$|E

Potential savings resulted from optimized gear shifting led to introduction of gear shift indicators in passenger vehicles as an obligation from year 2012.

That was the motive for the authors to conduct the experiments to justify their usage, both from the economic and ecological standpoint. The presented results come from the tests conducted on FIAT 500 L vehicle to determine the fuel consumption using the new European driving cycle, but for three different gear shift patterns: (1) as defined in <b>UNECE</b> <b>Regulation</b> <b>No.</b> 83, (2) as indicated by vehicle’s gear shift indicator, and (3) based on the average vehicle speed values collected from gear shift indicators of 35 passenger vehicles of different makes, types, and characteristics.
