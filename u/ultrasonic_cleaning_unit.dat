The cleaned microscope slides were blown dry and stored until use. One microscope slide and one cover slip with a modified surface were assembled to one chamber, using the microscope slide as top and the modified cover slip as bottom of the chamber. Four spacers made of cross-linked poly(dimethylsiloxane) of a height of 0.8 mm were used to define the chamber height, using one spacer per cover slip corner. The assembly of cover slip-spacer-microscope slide was sealed with a biocompatible, fast curing silicone-based polymer (twinsil®), leaving two gaps for entry and exit to the chamber.|$|E
40|$|Mineral intake is {{important}} for high production level. Estimation of exact mineral intake is difficult in grazing and/or group housed animals like cattle. Accessing of long term mineral status seems to be possible using hair mineral analyses. However, several factors can affect the results. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to test the effect of sampling location and breed on the mineral content of beef cows’ hair fed the same feeding regime. Ten Hungarian Simmental and ten Charolais cow were selected from the same farm. Coloured hair samples free of visible contamination were obtained from the withers, side and quarter of the cows. Hungarian Simmental samples were used to test the effect of sampling location. Since it did not show significant effect, Charolais samples were analysed as pooled. Samples were mineralized using nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide using <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>unit.</b> Calcium, magnesium, sodium, copper, selenium and zinc content were determined by ICP-OES (Perkin-Elmer, Optima 3300 DV). Statistical analyses were carried out by SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) GLM procedure. Significant breed differences were detected in the case of calcium, magnesium and copper. The measured values were above or around the normal ranges, suggesting that the mineral status of the herd was adequate. Sampling location of short hairs had no influence on the mineral profile...|$|E
30|$|All {{steps were}} {{performed}} {{in the same way}} for 5 batches of 4 cover slips each. The term ‘batch’ is throughout the study consistently and exclusively used for the modified surfaces, successively named batch 1 – 5. The glass cover slips were first cleaned in an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>unit</b> (Sonorex Digital DK 102 P from BANDELIN electronic GmbH & Co. KG; Berlin, Germany) at 50 °C and 100 % power for 20 min in a 20 % (v/v) solution of Extran® MA 01 and after a thorough wash in double distilled H 2 O (ddH 2 O) once more at 50 °C and 100 % power for 20 min in ddH 2 O. Subsequently, the cover slips were rinsed again in ddH 2 O and immersed into a freshly prepared 10 % solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and incubated overnight to resolve interfering surface ions, in particular sodium and potassium ions [15]. After a thorough wash with ddH 2 O, the cover slips were immersed into a freshly prepared piranha solution (30 % hydrogen peroxide: 95 % sulphuric acid 1 : 2) at room temperature (RT) for 1 h. This treatment ‘activates’ the surface by covering it with hydroxyl groups [16]. The cover slips were washed extensively with ddH 2 O and blow dried in a nitrogen flow just before the PEGylation step. The one-step PEGylation of the surface was performed as described [7]. In short, dry toluene was added to a reaction flask under a nitrogen atmosphere and the dry and activated cover slips were placed in the toluene. An amount of approximately 0.5 mg of mPEG 2000 -urea-triethoxysilane per ml of toluene was added, corresponding to 0.25 mM. Triethylamine was then added under nitrogen atmosphere in an amount of 253 nl per ml of toluene (2.5 μM). Approximately 1 μl of ddH 2 O per 10 ml of toluene was added to the inner wall of the reaction flask to aid the reaction (personal communication with Yvonne Schön, MPI Stuttgart, Germany). The reaction flask was closed and incubated at 80 °C overnight. The next day, after cooling the flask to RT, the cover slips were directly immersed into ethyl acetate and washed twice in ethyl acetate and three times in methanol. After a sonication in methanol for 2 min at 100 %, the cover slips were dried in a stream of nitrogen.|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} commonly faced in reproductive studies of teleosts is to cost effectively and safely separate oocytes {{from one another}} and from surrounding ovarian tissue. This challenge is exacerbated when ovarian tissue has been chemically preserved. Using Platycephalus caeruleopunctatus, a platycephalid species found within oceanic waters along {{the east coast of}} Australia, as an example species, within this study we describe and assess the utility of an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> device to separate oocytes from preserved ovarian tissue. The <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> device was observed to separate oocytes from the surrounding ovarian tissue within less than 80. min of treatment and had no deleterious effects on the number of oocytes present. Treatment within the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> device reduced oocyte diameters at a constant rate of 3. 9 μm per hour among the samples tested. As the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> device was able to separate oocytes from connective tissue within 80. min, this observed rate of reduction in oocyte diameters is unlikely to be detected at the resolution at which oocytes are traditionally measured and is less than that reported to occur using alternate chemically derived methods to separate oocytes from preserved connective tissue. Following the assessment of using an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> device to separate oocytes from ovarian tissue for P. caeruleopunctatus, this technique has been successfully employed to separate oocytes from preserved ovarian tissue for a variety of other teleost species including Macquaria colonorum, Platycephalus longispinis and Ratabulus diversidens. The use of an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> device to separate oocytes from preserved ovarian tissue will increase the efficiency of future investigations into teleost reproductive biology and potentially in other fields of research where particle separation and analysis are required. 5 page(s...|$|R

The <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> and removal were repeated until the upper portion was transparent even during <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning.</b> The coarse part of the sample remaining in the beaker was dried completely at 110 °C and was weighed to yield the weight, by difference, of the removed fine part (< several tens μm). The weight of the fine part was later used to yield a particle size distribution (in wt%). The removal of the fine part also aids the observation of coarser particles under the binocular microscope for component analyses.|$|R

40|$|Sandblasting {{particles}} {{which remain}} on the surfaces of dental restorations are removed prior to cementation. It is probable that adhesive strength between luting material and sandblasting particle remnants might exceed that with restorative material. If that being the case, blasting particles adhere to sandblasted material surface could be instrumental to increasing adhesive strength like underlying bonding mechanism between luting material and silanized particles of tribochemical silica coating-treated surface. We hypothesize that <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> of bonding surfaces, which were pretreated with sandblasting, may affect adhesive strength of a resin luting material to dental restorative materials. We therefore observed adhesive strength of resin luting material to aluminum oxide was greater than those to zirconia ceramic and cobalt-chromium alloy beforehand. To measure the shear bond strengths of resin luting material to zirconia ceramic and cobalt-chromium alloy, forty specimens of each restorative material were prepared. Bonding surfaces were polished with silicon abrasive paper and then treated with sandblasting. For each restorative material, 40 sandblasted specimens were equally divided into two groups: <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> (USC) group and non-ultrasonic cleaning (NUSC) group. After resin luting material was polymerized on bonding surface, shear test was performed to evaluate effect of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> of bonding surfaces pretreated with sandblasting on bond strength. For both zirconia ceramic and cobalt-chromium alloy, NUSC group showed significantly higher shear bond strength than USC group. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> of dental restorations after sandblasting should be avoided to retain improved bonding between these materials...|$|R

Cleaning efficiency was tested at two temperatures (30 and 45 degrees C) and two cleaning times (30 and 60 s) with two cleaning detergents (KOH, and NaOH combined with KOH). Conveyor belt materials were soiled with milk-based soil and L. monocytogenes strains V 1, V 3, and B 9, and then incubated for 72 h to attach bacteria to surfaces. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> treatments reduced L. monocytogenes counts on stainless steel 4. 61 to 5. 90 log units; on acetal, 3. 37 to 5. 55 log units; and on polypropylene, 2. 31 to 4. 40 log units. The logarithmic reduction differences were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. The logarithmic reduction was significantly greater in stainless steel than in plastic materials (P< 0. 001 for polypropylene, P= 0. 023 for acetal). Higher temperatures enhanced the cleaning efficiency in tested materials. No significant difference occurred between cleaning times. The logarithmic reduction was significantly higher (P= 0. 013) in cleaning treatments with potassium hydroxide detergent.
