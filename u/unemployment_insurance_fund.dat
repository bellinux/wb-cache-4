500|$|The early 1950s saw {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} in Canada; in most years there was a government surplus. In 1951, the Government introduced an old age pension for Canadians to receive {{from the age of}} 70. With little unemployment and thus a surplus in the <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund,</b> coverage was extended to seasonal workers, such as fishermen. St. Laurent's supervision of his ministers was minimal at the start of his tenure, and decreased as the years passed. With the Opposition few in numbers, ministers did as they wanted, and when Howe was accused by British Columbia Tory MP Howard Green in 1951 of being willing to end tariffs if the people would let him, Howe replied, [...] "Who would stop us?

2500|$|Papen was authoritarian by inclination. Richard J.

He imposed increasingly stringent censorship on the press and repealed his predecessor's ban on the Sturmabteilung (SA) {{as a way to}} appease the Nazis, whom he hoped to lure into supporting his government. [...] Papen's economic policies, which were all passed by Article 48, were to sharply cut the payments offered by the <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund,</b> subject all jobless Germans seeking unemployment insurance to a very strict means test, had wages drastically lowered (including those reached by collective bargaining) while bringing in very generous tax cuts to corporations and the rich. Papen argued that lowering taxes on the well off and corporations would encourage them to spend and create jobs; that lowering wages would encourage businesses to hire and reducing unemployment insurance would force the jobless (whom Papen often implied were just lazy people who didn't want to work) to find work; and thus alleviate the effects of the Great Depression. As 1932 was the worst year of the Great Depression with joblessness at an all-time high, Papen's economic policies of favoring the rich while punishing the poor enraged ordinary Germans, making him into Germany's most hated man. Papen reveled in his unpopularity and took a great deal of pleasure in taunting and baiting his critics as he enjoyed provoking people. Papen's thesis that lowering wages would make employers more likely to hire and less likely to fire employees was not a popular one as he was widely viewed as engaging in [...] "one-sided catering" [...] to big business.|$|E

We separate permanent from transitory wages and characterise them using membership of <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds.</b> We find that <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> is associated with lower wage growth heterogeneity over the life cycle and greater wage instability, changing the nature of wage inequality from permanent to transitory.

50|$|Possible {{policy options}} {{for states to}} shore up the <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> include {{lowering}} benefits for recipients and/or raising taxes on businesses.

Starting in 2010, a claimant’s weekly benefits will decrease from 68% to 62% and the taxable wage base will increase from $8,000 to $12,000, over a ten-year period. These moves are estimated to save the state over $450 million.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies how {{changes in}} the two key {{parameters}} of <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> - the benefit replacement rate (RR) and the potential duration of benefits (PBD) - affect the duration of unemployment. In 1989, the Austrian government made <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> more generous by changing, simultaneously, the maximum duration of regular unemployment benefits and the earnings replacement ratio. We find that increasing the replacement ratio has much weaker disincentive effects than increasing the maximum duration of benefits. We use these results to split up the total costs to <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> into costs due to {{changes in the}} <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> system and costs due to behavioral responses of unemployed workers. Results indicate that costs due to behavioral responses are substantial. ...|$|R

As a result, it can no longer be considered solely an income protection scheme.

As a consequence, there has been an interprovincial transfer of <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> from low to high unemployment regions. The regional characteristics of the programme have also distorted the structure of labour markets in high unemployment regions by attracting workers in seasonal industries therefore maintaining unemployment rates high...|$|R

50|$|Being {{classified}} {{as an independent}} contractor also affects whether an employee can receive unemployment benefits. In many states, independent contractors {{are not eligible for}} unemployment benefits because nothing has been paid into the <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund</b> on their behalf. Employers who have no W-2 employees are not required to make payments to the <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund,</b> and since no one can file a claim for benefits, they don't have to worry about their accounts being charged any extra. So should a misclassified employee lose his job through no fault of his own, that employee has to contact their state Unemployment Agency (for example EDD in California) and file a claim. EDD would then investigate the matter and make a determination as to whether the worker was an employee or a contractor, and award unemployment benefits accordingly.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, social {{security}} benefits, including unemployment benefits, are funded through the taxation system. There is no compulsory national <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund.</b> Rather, benefits are funded {{in the annual}} Federal Budget by the National Treasury and are administrated and distributed throughout the nation by the government agency, Centrelink. Benefit rates are indexed to the Consumer Price Index and are adjusted twice a year according to inflation or deflation.|$|E

The new political agreement on retirement reform implied that the age for entering the in the VERP was gradually increased by half a year each year from 2014 to 2017. Also the VERP was changed into a three-year scheme compared to the existing five years.|$|R

Another important task is to promote the organisation's views to decision-makers and the general public. It also has representatives on the governing bodies of many government authorities. The Confederation is also responsible for research and signing labour market insurance schemes.

30|$|Not surprisingly, {{the trade}} unions have {{strongly}} opposed {{the reform of}} the unemployment benefit system, which they see as undermining {{the most important element}} of income security in the Danish model. They furthermore stress that the reform came on top of a gradual erosion of the compensation rate of unemployment benefits relative to gross wage, which had taken place since the early 1980 s, and are also worried that the reform will increase the decline in the membership of <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds,</b> which has also been a long-standing feature of the Danish labour market for decades. By example the share of insured employees in the workforce fell from 78.4 percent in 1999 to 73.9 percent in 2009.|$|R

50|$|Under Erlander, {{the central}} {{pillars of the}} Swedish welfare state were enacted between 1946 and 1947, a period known as the Social Democratic “Harvest Time.” In 1946 and 1947, three major reforms were enacted that {{introduced}} a basic pension, general child allowances and sickness cash benefits. The National Housing Board was set up as the central authority providing subsidized loans and rent controls, while the National Labour Market Board was established to coordinate the nationalized local employment offices and supervise the union-controlled but state-subsidized <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds.</b> In 1947, a tax reform was carried out that reduced income taxes in low-income brackets, introduced an inheritance tax, and raised the marginal tax rate for higher tax brackets.|$|R
30|$|A further {{issue is}} the {{adequacy}} of income support. As already described, about 85 percent of the employed will receive some form of income support, if becoming unemployed. The backside hereof is of course, that 15 percent will be without any safety net and also not eligible for receiving the offers of active labour market policy. The rising number of persons reporting as unemployed in the Labour Force Surveys, but not being registered as unemployed at the job-centres, could be another indication {{of the limits of}} Danish income security. Also, the declining membership of the <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> may to some degree be caused by the erosion of the replacement rates of unemployment benefits, which has taken place since the 1980 s.|$|R

40|$|The Danish {{unemployment}} insurance funds {{are at the}} moment {{in a period of}} time characterized by change. During {{the last couple of years}} there has been a series of remarkable amendments to the laws on the area that has changed the conditions under which the {{unemployment insurance}} funds function. Furthermore, the competition for members has increased, and many of the unemployment funds are experiencing a decrease in their membership. This has brought along a discussion of the relevance of the funds in their current form. The present Minister of employment has declared that the unemployment insurance funds should consider themselves as being examined in their handling of new responsibilities that the ‘welfare reform’ from 2007 has assigned to them. The circumstances position the unemployment insurance funds under pressure. They have to be both economically efficient, have a controlling and authoritative function towards the unemployed members, and at the same time attend to the interest of the members. This thesis takes its starting point in HK’s <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund</b> that implemented major organisational changes in October 2007 centralising the <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund</b> and dividing the employees into specialised sections, each with a specific part of the fund’s functions. The focus is on how HK’s <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund,</b> through the organisational changes, has adapted to the conditions on the area, and how this affects the relation to the members. The thesis analyses this focus through a case study based on qualitative interviews in a local section of the <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund,</b> supplemented with a survey sent to the majority of the employees in HK’s <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund.</b> The theoretical foundation of the analysis is theory on institutional change, isomorphism, by DiMaggio and Powell and organisation theory by Mintzberg concerning organisational structures and configurations. The analysis has shown that the organisational changes in HK’s <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund</b> have meant a significant change in the employees work, and the relation to the members. We found resistance towards the changes and a negative attitude among the employees. However, at the same time they also expressed advantages in the new way of dividing the functions and understanding relating to the need for change. The relation to the members has changed both due to the political and organisational changes. The employees feel the stress and difficulties due to the pressure on the <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund</b> to be both controlling, a service organisation and economically sustainable. This affects the contact with the members, both because the form of communication has changed away from personal meetings towards electronic communication, and because they are the ones directly facing the challenges of being both controlling and service minded towards the members...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} efficiency wages {{designed to}} provide workers with incentives to make appropriate effort levels, and involuntary unemployment, along the pioneering lines of Negishi (1979), Solow (1979), Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984), in a dynamic model involving heterogeneous agents and financial constraints as in Woodford (1986) and Grandmont, Pintus and de Vilder (GPV, 1998). Effort varies continuously while there is <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funded</b> out of taxation of labour incomes. Increasing <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> is beneficial to employment along the deterministic stationary state, and can even in some cases lead to a Pareto welfare improvement for all agents, through general equilibrium effects, by generating higher individual real labour incomes, hence larger consumptions of employed and unemployed workers, and thus a higher production. On the other hand, the local (in) determinacy properties of the stationary state are opposite to those obtained in the competitive specification of the model (GPV, 1998) : local determinacy (indeterminacy) occurs for elasticities of capitalefficient labour substitution lower (larger) than a quite small bound.
