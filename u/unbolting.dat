500|$|In a {{detailed}} {{study published in}} 1987 of the tiger's musical and noise-making functions, Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume concluded that since coming to Britain, [...] "the instrument has been ruthlessly reworked, {{and in doing so}} much of its original operating principles have been destroyed". There are two ranks of pipes in the organ (as opposed to the wailing and grunting functions), each [...] "comprising eighteen notes, [...] are nominally of 4ft pitch and are unisons - i.e. corresponding pipes in each register make sounds of the same musical pitch. This is an unusual layout for a pipe organ although while selecting the two stops together results in more sound ... there is also detectable a slight beat between the pipes so creating a celeste effect. ... it is considered likely that as so much work has been done ... this characteristic may be more an accident of tuning than an intentional feature". The tiger's grunt is made by a single pipe in the tiger's head and the man's wail by a single pipe emerging at his mouth and connected to separate bellows located in the man's chest, where they can be accessed by <b>unbolting</b> and lifting off the tiger. The grunt operates by cogs gradually raising the weighted [...] "grunt-pipe" [...] until it reaches a point where it slips down [...] "to fall against its fixed lower-board or reservoir, discharging the air to form the grunting sound" [...] Today all the sound-making functions rely on the crank-handle to power them, though Ord-Hume believes this was not originally the case.|$|E
2500|$|Coaster brakes {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being protected from the elements and thus perform well in rain or snow. Though coaster brakes generally go years without needing maintenance, they are more complicated than rim brakes to repair if it becomes necessary, especially the more sophisticated type with expanding brake shoes. Coaster brakes also do not have sufficient heat dissipation for use on long descents, a characteristic made legendary through events such as the 'Repack Downhill' race, where riders almost certainly would need to repack their coaster brakes after the grease melted or smoked due to the heat from lengthy downhill runs. A coaster brake can only be applied when the cranks are reasonably level, limiting how quickly it can be applied. As coaster brakes are only made for rear wheels, they have the disadvantage common to all rear brakes of skidding the wheel easily. This disadvantage may, however, be alleviated if the bicycle also has a hand-lever-operated front brake and the cyclist uses it. Another disadvantage is that the coaster brake is completely dependent on the chain being fully intact and engaged. If the chain breaks or disengages from the chainwheel and/or rear sprocket, the coaster brake provides no braking power whatsoever. [...] Like all hub brakes except disc brakes, a coaster brake requires a reaction arm to be connected to the frame. [...] This may require <b>unbolting</b> when the wheel is removed or moved in its fork ends to adjust chain tension.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--she {{can stay}} only one night," [...] said Hepzibah, <b>unbolting</b> the door. [...] "If Clifford were {{to find her}} here, it might disturb him!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{door was}} unchained and <b>unbolted,</b> and 'Good-night' said. And Sheila swept back in sombre pomp to her absorbed friends.|$|R
60|$|A {{cautious}} rap on {{the iron}} door, {{and it was}} <b>unbolted</b> by Walt Baxter, who {{had been assigned to}} that duty.|$|R
60|$|Peter {{rose and}} softly <b>unbolted</b> the door. The passage outside was in darkness. He listened intently for a moment, and {{returned}} yawning.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are <b>unbolting</b> {{the door}} into the yard," [...] John Wilkes whispered. [...] "I would give a month's pay to be behind them with a rope's end." ...|$|E
60|$|Felix rose at once; and his Shadow, rising before him, and <b>unbolting</b> {{the loose}} wooden {{fastener}} of the door, {{went out in}} haste to see who called beyond the white taboo-line of their sacred precincts.|$|E
60|$|At length {{the sound}} of feet was audible upon the stairs, and then {{the light of a}} candle shone through the keyhole of the door. There was a good deal of unchaining and <b>unbolting,</b> and the door was slowly opened.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A single bicycle wheel remains locked to an {{inverted}} U-rack after the bike has apparently been <b>unbolted</b> from {{the wheel and}} carried away.|$|R
60|$|Except for my bedroom, whither he {{was quite}} capable of {{following}} me, I had no refuge but the grounds. I <b>unbolted</b> {{the front door and}} went out.|$|R
60|$|Softly Yvonne <b>unbolted</b> a small door, and, {{passing through}} it, Agravaine found himself {{looking up at}} the stars, while the great walls of the castle towered above him.|$|R
60|$|Scott, with Faiz Ullah and two policemen, {{was already}} busied with the carts, backing {{them up to}} the truck and <b>unbolting</b> the {{sideboards}} quietly, while the others pitched in the bags of millet and wheat. Hawkins watched him {{for as long as it}} took to fill one cart.|$|E
6000|$|Anne, {{scarcely}} {{knowing what}} she did, descended {{the ladder and}} ran to the back-door, hastily <b>unbolting</b> it to save Bob's time, and gently opening it in readiness for him. She had no sooner done this than she felt hands laid upon her shoulder from without, and a voice exclaiming, 'That's how we doos it--quite an obleeging young man!' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Unbolting</b> {{the cellar}} door, the girls {{announced}} to the invisible captive that they were through, and then departed much depressed. Half-way up the second flight, they all stopped as suddenly {{as if they had}} seen a ghost; for looking over the banisters was Tom's face, crocky but triumphant, and in either hand a junk of candy, which he waved above them as he vanished, with the tantalizing remark, [...] "Don't you wish you had some?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Pickwick paid, {{the door}} was <b>unbolted,</b> and out they came; the uncombed gentleman bestowing a {{friendly}} nod upon Mr. Roker, {{who happened to be}} passing at the moment.|$|R
60|$|He <b>unbolted</b> the door, {{called in}} the bearers, wished us good morning, and with a look full of meaning and a crook of his finger at parting went his way.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When I woke this morning, Captain,' said Rob, 'which {{was about}} a quarter after five, I found these on my pillow. The shop-door was <b>unbolted</b> and unlocked, and Mr Gills gone.' ...|$|R
60|$|He entered very softly; in {{part because}} it was a church; {{in part because}} his tread was always soft; in part because Tom played a solemn tune; in part because he thought he would {{surprise}} him when he stopped. <b>Unbolting</b> the door of the high pew of state, he glided in and shut it after him; then sitting in his usual place, and stretching out his legs upon the hassocks, he composed himself to listen to the music.|$|E
60|$|The {{appearance}} of the red-nosed man had induced Sam, at first sight, to more than half suspect {{that he was the}} deputy-shepherd of whom his estimable parent had spoken. The moment he saw him eat, all doubt on the subject was removed, and he perceived at once that if he purposed to take up his temporary quarters where he was, he must make his footing good without delay. He therefore commenced proceedings by putting his arm over the half-door of the bar, coolly <b>unbolting</b> it, and leisurely walking in.|$|E
6000|$|I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to. I {{took one}} slow {{step at a}} time and there warn't a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart. The dogs were as still as the humans, but they {{followed}} a little behind me. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and <b>unbolting.</b> I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said, [...] "There, that's enough--put your head in." [...] I done it, but I judged they would take it off.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hark!" [...] said Ratcliffe, [...] "he calls me--Miss Vere, return home, {{and leave}} <b>unbolted</b> the postern-door of the garden; {{to that which}} opens on the back-stairs I have a private key." ...|$|R
50|$|Graham flour {{is similar}} to whole wheat flour in that both are made from the whole grain; however graham flour is not sifted during milling (i.e. <b>unbolted),</b> and is ground more coarsely.|$|R
60|$|But {{suddenly}} there came the shuffling of steps outside, {{and he had}} hardly time to wrap the loose links round his free hand, when the door was <b>unbolted</b> and two pirates came in.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a trapdoor," [...] the gentleman, {{in whose}} house they were, said, {{and led the}} way upstairs at full speed. As he was <b>unbolting</b> the trap, Walter ran into a bedroom and seized an armful of blankets, then ran up the ladder to the trapdoor, and stepped out on to the roof. The door was closed behind him, and he heard the bolts drawn, and then his host ran downstairs and told the frightened {{servants}} to open the doors, which had so far resisted the attack from without. Headed by an officer, the soldiers rushed in.|$|E
60|$|Next, he {{examined}} {{the framework of the}} door we had broken in, assuring himself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door opposite leading into Cynthia's room. That door was also bolted, as I had stated. However, he went to the length of <b>unbolting</b> it, and opening and shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution against making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed to rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly whipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some minute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.|$|E
6000|$|Without {{turning his}} head the gambler replied, [...] "Looking at the boat; she's booming along, just chawing up and {{spitting}} out the river, ain't she? Look at that sweep of water going under her paddle-wheels," [...] he continued, <b>unbolting</b> the rail and lifting it to allow the two men to peer curiously over the guards as {{he pointed to the}} murderous incline beneath them; [...] "a man wouldn't stand much show who got dropped into it. How these paddles would just snatch him bald-headed, pick him up and slosh him round and round, and then sling him out down there in such a shape that his own father wouldn't know him." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Heatherstone {{waved her}} hand {{to me with a}} bright smile, and tripped up the avenue, while her brother <b>unbolted</b> the gate, and, passing through, closed it again, locking it upon the outside.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll let you in, uncle; wait a moment," [...] said Lily, as she <b>unbolted</b> {{the window}} which opened out upon the lawn. [...] "It's dreadfully cold, so come in {{as fast as}} you can." ...|$|R
60|$|He stood up--she <b>unbolted</b> {{the back}} door, and looked out. A cold, raw night, not yet dawn, {{with a piece}} of a moon in the vague sky. She was glad she need not go out.|$|R
6000|$|With {{a fierce}} leap as of a maniac, {{he was at}} the door, pounding, rattling, and uttering hoarse and furious outcries. Even through his fury he heard quickened footsteps--her light, reckless, half-hysterical laugh--a bound upon the staircase--the hurried <b>unbolting</b> and opening of distant doors, as the lighter one with which he was {{struggling}} at last yielded to his blind rage, and threw him crashing into the sitting-room. The back door was wide open. He could hear the rustling and crackling of twigs and branches in different directions down the hillside, where the fugitives had separated as they escaped. And yet he stood there for an instant, dazed and wondering, [...] "What next?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, then. As {{the season}} is drawing to a close: as many {{hundreds}} of kind souls, snobbish or otherwise, have quitted London; as many hospitable carpets are taken up; and window-blinds are pitilessly papered with the MORNING HERALD; and mansions once inhabited by cheerful owners are now consigned {{to the care of}} the housekeeper's dreary LOCUM TENENS--some mouldy old woman, who, in reply to the hopeless clanging of the bell, peers at you for a moment from the area, and then slowly <b>unbolting</b> the great hall-door, informs you my lady has left town, or that 'the family's in the country,' or 'gone up the Rind,'--or what not; as the season and parties are over; why not consider Party-giving Snobs for a while, and review the conduct of some of those individuals who have quitted the town for six months? ...|$|E
60|$|If {{nothing else}} had {{happened}} to spoil the success of that sortie, the Nugget's depressing attitude would have done so. Of all things, it seems to me, a forlorn hope should be undertaken with a certain enthusiasm and optimism {{if it is to}} have a chance of being successful. Ogden threw a gloom over the proceedings from the start. He was cross and sleepy, and he condemned the expedition unequivocally. As we moved towards the back door he kept up a running stream of abusive comment. I silenced him before cautiously <b>unbolting</b> the door, but he had said enough to damp my spirits. I do not know what effect it would have had on Napoleon's tactics if his army--say, before Austerlitz--had spoken of his manoeuvres as a 'fool game' and of himself as a 'big chump', but I doubt if it would have stimulated him.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{he heard}} the front-door bell ringing, and hurried downstairs. He <b>unbolted</b> and {{unlocked}} the door, examined the chain, put it up, and opened cautiously without showing himself. A familiar voice hailed him. It was Adye.|$|R
60|$|George {{snatched}} it up, and rushed downstairs. In the sitting-room, all {{was dark and}} silent: there was no fire, no breakfast. George {{said it was a}} wicked shame of Mrs. G., and he made up his mind to tell her what he thought of her when he came home in the evening. Then he dashed on his great-coat and hat, and, seizing his umbrella, made for the front door. The door was not even <b>unbolted.</b> George anathematized Mrs. G. for a lazy old woman, and thought it was very strange that people could not get up at a decent, respectable time, unlocked and <b>unbolted</b> the door, and ran out.|$|R
60|$|The woman reflected. This {{was surely}} young Mershone's voice. And {{she had no}} excuse to deny him admittance. Quietly she <b>unbolted</b> the door and allowed it to open an inch while she peered at the man outside.|$|R
