5|$|United States Army Special Forces (SF) aka Green Berets perform several doctrinal missions: <b>unconventional</b> <b>warfare,</b> foreign {{internal}} defense, special reconnaissance, {{direct action}} and counter-terrorism. These missions make Special Forces {{unique in the}} U.S. military, because they are employed throughout the three stages of the operational continuum: peacetime, conflict and war. Foreign internal defense operations, SF's main peacetime mission, {{are designed to help}} friendly developing nations by working with their military and police forces to improve their technical skills, understanding of human rights issues, and to help with humanitarian and civic action projects. Special Forces <b>unconventional</b> <b>warfare</b> capabilities provide a viable military option for a variety of operational taskings that are inappropriate or infeasible for conventional forces. Special Forces are the U.S. military's premier <b>unconventional</b> <b>warfare</b> force. Foreign internal defense and <b>unconventional</b> <b>warfare</b> missions are the bread and butter of Special Forces soldiers. For this reason SF candidates are trained extensively in weapons, engineering, communications and medicine. SF soldiers are taught to be warriors first and teachers second because they must be able to train their team and be able to train their allies during a FID or UW mission. Often SF units are required to perform additional, or collateral, activities outside their primary missions. These collateral activities are coalition warfare/support, combat search and rescue, security assistance, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, humanitarian de-mining and counter-drug operations.|$|E

5|$|During the {{planning}} for the invasion of South Korea {{in the years before}} the war, the North Korean leadership began to create large numbers of commando and special forces units to send south. These units subverted South Korean authority before and during the war with terror campaigns, sabotage and inducing rebellions in ROK military units. Hundreds of commandos were sent to South Korea in this fashion, {{and by the end of}} the war up to 3,000 of them had been trained and armed. During this time, North Korean leadership also ordered the creation of large conventional units to act as advance forces for the actual invasion. The 766th Unit was formed in April 1949 at the Third Military Academy in Hoeryong, North Korea. The academy was specially designed to train commandos, and the 766th was originally designed to supervise North Korean light infantry ranger units.

40|$|Abstract—The {{increase}} in <b>unconventional,</b> urban <b>warfare</b> situations in US military operations creates {{the need for}} reliable data networks allowing military commanders and their troop’s maximum communication capability in urban environments. Currently, military commanders at the higher echelons are afforded decision support tools utilizing robust data and voice communication networks. Decision-making in smaller operational units, such as Platoons and Squads, could benefit from improved communication and situational awareness capabilities. The CS^ 2 team objective is to design and evaluate a mobile command support system to maximize communication between Platoon leaders and their Squads. The team’s study uses simulation programming environments to model the capacity and connectivity of wireless network communication in urban operations. The design alternatives to be modeled consist of various network topologies with different bandwidth capacities. Human factors and physical system requirements are evaluated analytically. The results of this modeling and analysis {{will be used to}} identify the most effective and reliable design alternative I...|$|R

While recuperating from his injuries he was given a staff role in Berlin, where he developed his ideas on <b>unconventional</b> commando <b>warfare.</b> Skorzeny's proposals were to develop units specialized in such warfare, including partisan-like fighting deep behind enemy lines, fighting in enemy uniform, sabotage attacks, etc. In April 1943 Skorzeny's name was put forward by Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the new head of the RSHA, and Skorzeny met with Walter Schellenberg, head of Amt VI, Ausland-SD, (the SS foreign intelligence service department of the RSHA). Schellenberg charged Skorzeny with command of the schools organized to train operatives in sabotage, espionage, and paramilitary techniques. Skorzeny was appointed commander of the recently created Waffen Sonderverband z.b.V.

40|$|Military {{conflicts}} {{have been}} changing {{from the traditional}} large force engagements, where the winners are decided by who has the most men left standing, to <b>unconventional</b> asymmetric <b>warfare</b> where a military force can win every battle but still lose the war. Warfare is evolving, {{partly due to the}} technology that is being leveraged by the military. Advanced targeting capabili-ties and precision guided weapons, like the Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), give com-manders in the field the capability to strike a target at any time and virtually ensure its destruc-tion or neutralization. This capability has led to a new way of thinking and targeting called Ef-fects Based Operations (EBO). EBO focuses soley on achieving operational objectives rather than inflicting kinetic damage. This relatively new way of thinking is conducive to the consid-eration of socio-cultural factors, but unfortunately our operational level planners have not been taught how to do this. Our operations and planning have traditionally been approached from a Western, Anglo-American perspective. Planners don't have a clear understanding of how tactical level actions will be perceived by the local population, and how those perceptions could nega-tively impact the attainment of the overall military objectives.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this subtask of the <b>Unconventional</b> Nuclear <b>Warfare</b> Design project was to demonstrate mitigation technologies for radiological material dispersal and to assist planners with incorporation of the technologies into a concept of operations. The High Consequence Assessment and Technology department at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) has studied aqueous foam's ability to mitigate {{the effects of a}}n explosively disseminated radiological dispersal device (RDD). These benefits include particle capture of respirable radiological particles, attenuation of blast overpressure, and reduction of plume buoyancy. To better convey the aqueous foam attributes, SNL conducted a study using the Explosive Release Atmospheric Dispersion model, comparing the effects of a mitigated and unmitigated explosive RDD release. Results from this study compared health effects and land contamination between the two scenarios in terms of distances of effect, population exposure, and remediation costs. Incorporating aqueous foam technology, SNL created a conceptual design for a stationary containment area to be located at a facility entrance with equipment that could minimize the effects from the detonation of a vehicle transported RDD. The containment design was evaluated against several criteria, including mitigation ability (both respirable and large fragment particle capture as well as blast overpressure suppression), speed of implementation, cost, simplicity, and required space. A mock-up of the conceptual idea was constructed at SNL's 9920 explosive test site to demonstrate the containment design...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedLarge-scale conventional wars have become quite rare, yet most militaries are built with this model in mind. Conversely, less well-resourced entities employ force through part-time fighters and prevail {{at a higher}} rate than expected when facing standing militaries; in these cases, they employ pre-existing combat-related skills mastered either in civilian life or through military refresher courses. This research seeks to determine whether a militia-focused approach may be the most cost-effective security choice for a community; it may not be optimal for short, blitzkrieg-like engagements, but it may employ force effectively for defending the community it represents. Through analyzing three historical cases that stretch from small-scale to nationwide war, from desert to forested mountains, from <b>unconventional</b> to mechanized <b>warfare,</b> and from active combat to pure successful deterrence, this thesis examines the conditions under which a militia-based defense system is a viable and attractive option for national defense.

40|$|Sea {{transport}} and logistical {{support of the}} Australian land based forces in Vietnam is acknowledged in recent historical compendiums as the most significant contribution made by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) to the Australian military commitment in Vietnam. However, previous studies have only paid brief attention to the vital part played by HMAS Sydney and other units of the RAN involved in the logistical support role, and none of these earlier works have undertaken a detailed consideration {{of the nature and}} tactical importance of sea {{transport and}} logistical support. The perceived absence of enemy threat was the prime factor influencing the Federal Government’s specious decision to exclude from benefits and entitlements, those that served in Sydney, Jeparit and Boonaroo, and the warships that escorted the troop transport into, what could only be described as a war zone. This decision, the thesis shows, was a flawed one, and it can only be concluded that it was {{made on the basis of}} inaccurate information. Moreover, while Sydney and her escort were at anchor, not only were they vulnerable to an enemy well versed in <b>unconventional</b> guerrilla <b>warfare,</b> but all who served in these ships were also exposed to highly toxic herbicides used to defoliate the nearby landscape, via the residue of this procedure which flowed into the rivers and streams. Due to the processes used in those times in the production of potable drinking water, the dioxins contained in the distillate were enriched making them much more potent and deadly.

However, they must still perform all the functions of traditional organizations: fundraising, internal and external communications, command and coordination, creation of a product, etc. Using an expert system to evaluate the structure of a terrorist organization could increase the amount of knowledge and understanding of it and provide critical insights into the organization's strengths and vulnerabilities. This research will focus on the utility of the expert system Organizational Consultant to evaluate the Hamas terrorist organization as a case study to determine its utility in discerning the organization's structure and suitability to its environment.
