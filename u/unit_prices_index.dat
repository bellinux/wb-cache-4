Using large-scale retail scanner data in Japan, we construct a <b>unit</b> value <b>price</b> <b>index</b> and decompose its fluctuation into (1) standard price change effects, (2) substitution effects within continuing goods, and (3) turnover-new product effects.

40|$|The {{importance}} of sustainable financial management {{of water and}} wastewater pipeline infrastructure has grown in recent years due to the increasing backlog of maintenance, renewal and replacement of aging water and wastewater infrastructure. As the water and wastewater infrastructure age, {{the condition of the}} water and wastewater infrastructure will continue to deteriorate increasing the cost for renewal and replacement. In response to the aging and deteriorating potable water and wastewater infrastructure Public Sector Accounting Board PS 3150 and Regulation 453 / 07 under the Ontario Safe Drinking Water Act were established. PS 3150 requires local governments to report their tangible capital assets along with their depreciation on financial statements. One key component of this reporting is determining the need for and cost of the replacement of these assets. Ontario Regulation 453 / 07 requires public utilities to prepare and submit long term financial plans for water systems. One key principle of the financial plans is that the expenses of operating water systems should be paid by revenues generated from providing the water systems. A crucial aspect of PS 3150, Ontario regulation 453 / 07 and the financial management of water and wastewater infrastructure are accurate estimates of future capital works construction <b>prices.</b> Historically, construction <b>indices</b> are used to forecast construction prices. Engineering New Record (ENR) Construction Cost Index (CCI), Federal Highway Administration (FWHA) composite National Highway Construction Cost Index (NHCCI) and Consumer <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (CPI) have been used to estimate future construction prices of water and wastewater infrastructure in Canada. However, these indices do not accurately represent the circumstance of the water and wastewater infrastructure construction sector, which can lead to errors and inaccuracies in construction price forecasts. It is recommended sector specific construction indices be used to forecast construction prices. However, there are few construction indices available for the water and wastewater infrastructure sector and available indices are not based on actual construction data. This thesis presents a methodology to accurately estimate future construction prices for water and wastewater pipeline capital works based on actual construction price data. The methodology contains three components: construction data processing, development of <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> for watermain and sanitary sewer construction, and estimation of inflation in watermain and sanitary sewer construction. The data processing component cleans and transforms actual construction price data from the City of Niagara Falls from 1981 to 2014 into a centralized, organized and auditable construction price dataset. Based on the construction <b>price</b> dataset, <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> specific to the watermain and sanitary sewer construction sector were developed. <b>Unit</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> were developed and calculated for watermain projects, pipes, valves, and hydrants, and sanitary sewer projects, pipes, and maintenance holes. Geometric Brownian Motion was used to estimate inflation in and forecast future construction prices for watermain and sanitary sewer capital works construction based on the developed <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices.</b> A Microsoft Access relational database containing the data processing function, calculation of watermain and sanitary sewer <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices,</b> and estimation of inflation was developed to improve the accuracy, efficiency and consistency of the methodology. Additionally, the methodology allows contractor markup in watermain and sanitary sewer construction and factors influencing watermain and sanitary sewer <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> to be examined. The inflation of watermain reference project construction is 5. 79 % per annum from 1982 - 2014, while the inflation of sanitary sewer reference project capital works construction is 4. 66 % per annum from 1981 - 2014. The inflation rates of watermain pipe, valve and hydrant construction from 1982 - 2014 are 6. 36 %, 5. 09 %, and 2. 81 % per annum, respectively. The inflation rates of sanitary sewer pipe and maintenance hole construction from 1981 - 2014 are 7. 41 % and 5. 25 % per annum, respectively. Inflation of watermain and sanitary sewer reference projects is above inflation of CPI, NRBCPI and LDCCT at 2. 25 %, 3. 17 % and 3. 77 % per annum, respectively, but below inflation of S&P/TSX composite index at 6. 90 % per annum. This indicates when forecasting future prices within a construction sector, the use of a proxy index will result in inaccurate estimates of future construction prices. In the water and wastewater pipeline construction sector the use of CPI, NRBCPI or LDCCT will result in significant underestimation of future construction prices. To obtain accurate estimates of future construction prices it is important to use sector specific indices which the developed <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> represent for the water and wastewater pipeline construction sector. In this thesis contractor markup is defined as a financial premium in excess of market inflation {{in the form of a}} per annum interest rate surcharge. Contractor markup includes risk premiums, overhead and profit. The contractor markups for watermain and sanitary sewer projects are 3. 54 % and 2. 41 %, respectively. As the number of tender bids submitted for a project increase, the <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> of reference projects generally decreases. This is caused by an increase in the competition among contractors resulting in a decrease in the <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> of the reference projects as bidders attempt to win the project. The Infrastructure Stimulus Fund increased the total number of projects and the total value of projects in 2009 and 2010 but did not significantly alter the watermain and sanitary sewer <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices...</b>|$|R

40|$|The general aim of {{this paper}} is to show that even the {{simplest}} economic models may be largely trivial. One discusses how a value input-output model can be derived from a physical input-output model. In the physical input-output model, variables are physical quantities and prices and in the value input-output model, variables are quantities in currency <b>units</b> and <b>price</b> <b>indexes.</b> One demonstrates that the value model must be biperiodical, that is, never a-periodic as assumed by Leontief, and that <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> must replace <b>prices.</b> Hence, two variants of the model are possible: (i) the operational model where the <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> are the solution of the value model for the base year and (ii) the true model where the current prices solve the physical model for the current year. It is impossible to decide which model is the best. Both models diverge generally unless some strong hypotheses are made: stability of the vertically integrated physical coefficients of labor, or even stability of the physical structure itself. Working on an aperiodic value model is not innocent even if virtually all scholars and practitioners use to do by operational necessity.

For business-to-business transactions, these shifts can cause sourcing substitution bias in the Producer <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (PPI) and the Import <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (MPI), as well as potentially in the proposed new true Input <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IPI). Similarly, when consumers shift their expenditures for the same products temporally to take advantage of promotional sales or among retailers charging different per <b>unit</b> <b>prices,</b> this can cause a promotions bias problem in the Consumer <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (CPI) or a CPI outlet substitution bias.

In contrast to the official Consumer <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> that shows little impact, our <b>price</b> <b>index</b> based on scanner data reveals a modest yet notable increase in within-store commodity prices following the disaster in eastern Japan. We find that the disaster had a large and lasting effect in reducing the frequency and magnitude of bargain sales at retail stores especially in Tokyo. However, under severe commodity shortages, the standard index based on within-store same-commodity price changes may not capture the actual changes in the cost of living. To overcome this problem, we propose two alternative <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> based on (1) commodity price without distinguishing stores and (2) <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> without distinguishing commodities (i. e., brands) within the same category. Focusing on the food categories for which the disaster induced large excess demand, we find that rise in the alternative <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> was considerably greater than that in the standard <b>price</b> <b>index.</b> We further show that observed price elasticity between stores (as well as between brands) declined significantly after the disaster, indicating that, in the face of commodity shortages, the same commodity sold at different stores (or even different brands within the same category) became closer substitutes for consumers...|$|R

5000|$|Measuring {{inflation}} {{in an economy}} requires objective means of differentiating changes in nominal prices on {{a common set of}} goods and services, and distinguishing them from those price shifts resulting from changes in value such as volume, quality, or performance. For example, if the price of a 10 oz. can of corn changes from $0.90 to $1.00 {{over the course of a}} year, with no change in quality, then this price difference represents inflation. This single price change would not, however, represent general {{inflation in}} an overall economy. To measure overall inflation, the price change of a large [...] "basket" [...] of representative goods and services is measured. This is the purpose of a <b>price</b> <b>index,</b> which is the combined price of a [...] "basket" [...] of many goods and services. The combined price is the sum of the weighted prices of items in the [...] "basket". A weighted price is calculated by multiplying the <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> of an item by the number of that item the average consumer purchases. Weighted pricing is a necessary means to measuring the impact of individual <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> changes on the economy's overall inflation. The Consumer <b>Price</b> <b>Index,</b> for example, uses data collected by surveying households to determine what proportion of the typical consumer's overall spending is spent on specific goods and services, and weights the average prices of those items accordingly. Those weighted average prices are combined to calculate the overall price. To better relate price changes over time, indexes typically choose a [...] "base year" [...] price and assign it a value of 100. <b>Index</b> <b>prices</b> in subsequent years are then expressed in relation to the base year price.

40|$|Purpose - The {{contribution}} {{of this study}} is both methodological and empirical. It provides a method of estimating preference consistent true cost of living indices and demonstrates the use of unit values (food items), adjusted for quality and demographic effects, as prices. Using NSS data, changes in living standards (measured by per capita real expenditure) in India are examined between 1999 / 2000 and 2009 / 2010. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - From the adjusted <b>unit</b> values, "exact" <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> are computed using QAIDS-based preference consistent methods that allow between-item substitution effects and variation across states. Findings - A comparison of the nominal and price deflated real expenditures under alternative temporal price scenario during 1999 / 2000 - 2009 / 2010 shows that the states largely preserve their ranks over the periods, in spite of differential temporal price movement. However, comparison of the nominal and price-deflated real expenditure growth reveals that the rankings are sensitive to the price deflator used. Practical implications - The results question the wisdom of the treatment of large countries with heterogeneous preferences, e. g. India, as single entities in PPP calculations as in the ICP project. Hence, the results have methodological and empirical implications that extend beyond India. Originality/value - The study provides evidence on the issue of spatial difference in the temporal movement in prices, where no such evidence exists, and contains the first evidence on living standards in India in the post global financial crisis era. Also, this is the first attempt to base calculation of temporal movement in prices, as measured by the "exact" <b>price</b> <b>indices,</b> on the adjusted unit values of food items. 17 page(s...|$|R

Two previous FAO studies have presented seafood <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> together with issues and methodologies involved with constructing them (Kiel, 1993; Doglia, 1999). This study builds on those two, but here we {{take advantage of the}} increased availability of seafood trade statistics through the Internet. The <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> presented here only cover a small part of global seafood trade, which imply that numerous seafood markets have been omitted. The scope was limited to keep the workload at manageable proportions. Fresh salmon, frozen shrimp, frozen cod and canned tuna products in the EU and the US markets are targeted for the <b>price</b> <b>indices.</b> Most indices start from January 1989 or early 1990 s. The selection covers two of the largest seafood markets (Japanese seafood imports are larger than the US in value, but is disregarded because of less accessible trade statistics). Likewise, the products are in terms of value among the most important in international seafood trade. There are clear advantages of focusing on such widely traded products: (1) because of their importance in seafood trade, they can be indicative {{for the price of a}} number of related seafood products, (2) more reliable and consistent data are available for these products compared with many other seafood products, and (3) by limiting the selection to a few key products and key markets the work will be kept at manageable proportions. The FAO seafood <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> are representative for a limited number of species and markets. The performance of the <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> is compared against price data for similar products from the Globefish databank. Overall the <b>unit</b> values mimic <b>prices</b> better than what might initially have been expected. For several reasons, however, there can be considerable discrepancies between price-based index and the FAO unit value based import <b>price</b> <b>indices.</b> Similar but not identical products are being compared, the unit values suffer from compositional effects, and the lag effect in trade data all contribute to the discreapancies. Despite these discrepancies the unit values indices appear to capture the major price trends in the markets. Statistical tests provide further evidence that there is a strong relationship between the <b>unit</b> values and <b>prices</b> series in the long run...|$|R

Existing Norwegian house <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> start in the mid- 1980 s, and hence we present new {{information}} about Norwegian house prices for more than 160 years. Raw data are compiled from the real property registers, and the house <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> are constructed {{by the use of}} the weighted repeat sales method. The cities in our sample are four of the five largest in Norway- Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim and Kristiansand. We construct house <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> for each city in addition to an aggregate index. The new house <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> are spliced with existing house <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> from 1986. 1...|$|R
