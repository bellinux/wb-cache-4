After the death was {{announced}} over the public address system, the crowd spontaneously stood <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> off their hats, and did the players, and they observed a self-initiated moment of silence. However, McCabe’s friend and former teammate Fingleton, now a journalist, criticised the Australian team for not wearing black armbands.|$|E

25|$|Going back {{to those}} studio days for me and John Paul Jones, {{the one thing you}} didn't do was speed up, because if you sped up you wouldn't be seen again.

25|$|Bryks landed {{safely and}} started to bury his parachute. Frenchmen who had seen him descend gave him a {{civilian}} coat to hide his RAF uniform {{and told him to}} come to a safe house in a nearby hamlet. Bryks hid in a barn until nightfall, then went to the hamlet where he asked at a house for a doctor to treat his burns. The occupants betrayed him by calling the Germans, but when Bryks heard their motorised patrol coming he fled the house and hid in a garden. The patrol caught him, beat him <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> him to St Omer.|$|E

25|$|Marcognet's {{central column}} bumped into d'Aspré's picket line. Alerted, the Austrians in Günzburg {{immediately}} destroyed the bridges. Trapped between the French and the now-unbridged river, d'Aspré surrendered with 200 Tyrolean jägers and two cannons. Malher pressed on and attacked the town. Günzburg sits on high ground overlooking the Danube and {{an island in}} the stream. The island was crossed by two bridges. From the south bank, positions suitable for artillery dominate the low banks and the island. The soldiers of the Archduke Charles Infantry Regiment Nr. 3 and 20 cannons laid down a deadly curtain of fire. Malher brought forward four cannons, but they were overwhelmed by Austrian counter-battery fire. After a futile effort to rebuild the bridges under fire, the French gave <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> cover.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{the state}} of Nuevo León and its {{surrounding}} territories have become a battleground for a brutal conflict between Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel, two drug trafficking organizations from northeastern Mexico. Reports of forced disappearances have not been uncommon in the past years. The municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez — a middle-class, industrial community where the bodies were found — {{is known for its}} broom factory, an oil refinery, and its historical role {{as one of the first}} places where baseball was played in Mexico. Nonetheless, it had at least five municipal employees slain in April 2012; just a week before the massacre, a military general stepped <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> over the city's depleted police force. In fact, the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez is under dispute by Los Zetas, the Gulf Cartel, and the Sinaloa Cartel; the area is a strategic point for human smuggling, drug trafficking, and oil theft. The municipality of Cadereyta is the most violent municipality in {{the state of}} Nuevo León that does not form part of the Monterrey metropolitan area.|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, Tania {{became friends}} with Joey Henderson during the 'Ferndale Strangler' storyline and became dangerously close to {{becoming}} one of his victims after she told Alice Piper {{that he was just}} a 'boy' and she wasn't interested in dating him. When Joey overheard this, he was revealed to be the Ferndale Strangler in the 2007 Christmas cliffhanger with him preparing to strangle Tania with IV tubing inside her apartment. When Tania cut her finger with a knife, Joey panicked and put the IV line away, with her narrowly avoiding death without even knowing it. After this he stalked her in a shopping mall and hoped to kidnap her by offering her a lift but Yvonne picked her <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> her up north for Christmas. Joey missed his chance, and once again Tania avoided death unknowingly. Tania dated both Kip Denton (Will Hall) and Hone Ropata (Temuera Morrison) before she began an abusive relationship with gang member Kingi Te Wake (Te Kohe Tuhaka). Kingi left her and Tania dated Ben Goodall (Shaun Edwards-Brown), only to lose him to her mother. Ben was assaulted by a small gang of hoodlums and later it was discovered he had a brain hemorrhage. He fell brain dead and after several arguments between Yvonne and his sister Anita (Lara Fischel-Chisholm) as to whether he would come back alive or not, his life support was turned off a week later. Tania was very upset over his death and she and Yvonne reunited. She rebounded with Isaac Worthington (Matt Minto) but left him when he cheated on her. In late 2010 {{she fell in love with}} Rafe Durville (Simon London) and left the country with him to Australia to start a clinic. She returned briefly in 2012 for Yvonne's birthday. In 2013, Bella Durville (Amelia Reid-Meredith) visited Tania and Rafe.|$|E

500|$|English Heritage {{suggests}} that a 15th-century letter from a Hanseatic merchant, Gerhard von Wessel, helps to identify the battlefield via geological features. It mentions a [...] "broad green" [...] which corresponds to Hadley Green, and the marsh on the right flank of the Yorkist line {{is likely to be}} in the valley of the Monken Mead Brook. The letter also mentions St Albans road, which has remained largely the same, winding through the fields. Urbanisation over the 18th and 19th centuries, however, has populated much of the area with buildings. By the 20th century, the suburb of Monken Hadley covered part of the fields where the Battle of Barnet was fought. A hedge in the local golf course, as suggested by Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred H. Burne, is likely the row of shrubs behind which Oxford's men lined <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> cover.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, {{during the}} Re-Invention World Tour, Madonna {{performed}} the song wearing a Scottish kilt, and a T-shirt that said [...] "Kabbalists do it Better" [...] {{on most of}} the shows, and [...] "Brits do it Better" [...] and [...] "Irish do it Better" [...] T-shirts during the shows in the United Kingdom and Ireland, reminiscent of the one she used in the song's music video. Madonna also performed a shorter, abbreviated version of [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] in the MDNA Tour in 2012. Wearing a black tight outfit, Madonna sang the song while crawling around on the ground, then {{towards the end of the}} performance, several dancers wearing military clothing and animal masks surrounded and tied her <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> her to the main stage, giving way to the next performance, [...] "Hung Up".|$|E
500|$|Three weeks later, Hubbard {{abducted}} both Northrup and Alexis. On {{the night}} of February 24, 1951, Alexis was being looked after by John Sanborne while Northrup had {{a night at the}} movies. Hubbard turned <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> the child. A few hours later, he returned with two of his Dianetics Foundation staff and told Northrup, who was now back at her apartment: [...] "We have Alexis and you'll never see her alive unless you come with us." [...] She was bundled {{into the back of a}} car and driven to San Bernardino, California, where Hubbard attempted to find a doctor to examine his wife and declare her insane. His search was unsuccessful and he released her at Yuma Airport across the state line in Arizona. He promised that he would tell her where Alexis was if she signed a piece of paper saying that she had gone with him voluntarily. Northrup agreed but Hubbard reneged on the deal and flew to Chicago, where he found a psychologist who wrote a favorable report about his mental condition to refute Northrup's accusations. Rather than telling Northrup where Alexis was, he called her and said that [...] "he had cut [...] into little pieces and dropped the pieces in a river and that he had seen little arms and legs floating down the river and it was my fault, I'd done it because I'd left him." ...|$|E
