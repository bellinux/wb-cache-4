40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} to characterise the (optimal) demand for cash balances in deregulated markets. After the model of James Tobin, 1958, net balances are determined in order to maximise the expected return of a certain portfolio combining risk and capital.

Within this setting, the monetary equilibrium determines the rate at which a unit of capital is exchange by a unit of exposure to risk, or equivalently, it determines the market price of risk.

The effects of credit and monetary flows on money and security markets can be precisely described on these grounds. An alternative framework for the analysis of monetary policy is thus provided. ...|$|R

It {{provides an overview}} of existing research limitations and uncertainties and the plausible etiologic risk factors associated with cancer in this understudied occupation. MethodsPrevious cancer studies among police officers were obtained via a systematic review of the MEDLINE, CABDirect, and Web of Science bibliographic databases. ResultsQuality observational studies of cancer among police officers are sparse and subject to limitations in exposure assessment and other methods. Results from three studies suggested possible increased mortality risks for all cancers, and cancers of the colon, kidney, digestive system, esophagus, male breast, and testis, as well as Hodgkin 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s disease. Few incidence studies have been performed, and results have been mixed, although some associations with police work have been observed for thyroid, skin, and male breast cancer. ConclusionsPolice are exposed to a mix of known or suspected agents or activities that increase cancer risk. Epidemiologic evidence to date is sparse and inconsistent.

This can lead to estimates that indicate apparent “causal” relationships, despite there being no true effect of the exposure.

These approaches use information from all imperfect assessments simultaneously in a unified manner, which in turn can provide a more accurate estimate of exposure–disease association than that based on individual assessments.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{on the impact of}} currency risk on stock returns has failed to find a significant role for foreign exchange rates. This paper addresses several explanations of this finding with a unique dataset of U. S. firms that acquire targets in other countries. The dataset allows estimating the impact of exchange rates using firm-specific bilateral exchange rates and a time period where <b>underlying</b> <b>exposure</b> is known to exist. We also relate the change in exposure from before to after the acquisition to various characteristics of the acquirer, such as its presence in the target country prior to the deal and its hedging activities, and characteristics of the target, such as the exposure of the target prior to the deal, the relative size of the deal, and the volatility of the exchange rate of the target’s country. The results suggest that identifying a relevant exchange rate can be an important consideration in studying the impact of exchange rate risk on stock returns. Moreover, corporate hedging activities play a role, since the foreign targets provide operational hedging benefits to the U. S. acquirers. Many acquirers also use foreign currency derivatives and debt denominated in foreign currency, though the effect of financial hedging on currency exposures is found to be small for the firms in the sample...|$|E
