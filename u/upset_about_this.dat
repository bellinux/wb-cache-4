5|$|McCulloch met former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr in 1993 {{and they}} wrote and {{recorded}} an album, tentatively titled Touch Down. The album {{was to be}} released in early 1994; however, despite McCulloch and Marr being happy with the album, Rob Dickins at WEA felt it was missing some element. Dickins suggested to McCulloch that Sergeant be brought in to do some work. McCulloch was initially sceptical because he had not spoken with Sergeant since de Freitas's funeral; however, he did give the idea some thought. Before McCulloch had chance to contact Sergeant, a mutual friend persuaded the pair to meet socially. While McCulloch and Sergeant were being reacquainted, the tapes from the McCulloch and Marr sessions disappeared. McCulloch was not <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> as he and Sergeant had started working together as Electrafixion.|$|E

Thereafter, it is revealed that Sloan is in a comatose state, and will be taken off of life support that evening. In the hospital cafeteria, Meredith Grey announces that Wilson will be given the honor of performing a supervised appendectomy, a procedure historically used {{as a reward for}} interns.

50|$|Bharathan is a {{post-graduate}} and unemployed. Somehow {{he manages}} {{to get the job}} of a Malayalam teacher at a tuition centre. His wife Geetha works in a consumer store. The couple stays in a rented house owned by Kariyachan. Bharathan is a genius inventor and has a rather inquisitive mind especially as far as scientific matters are concerned. He is always around inventions with little care on what happens around him. He never sticks to any particular job, which lands his family in deep financial troubles. His wife Geetha is <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> all <b>this,</b> but there is little she can do to keep her husband from becoming the laughing stock of many who don't understand him. Some people like Kariachan (Jagathy Sreekumar) cleverly usurp the patent rights of some of Bharathan's crude inventions. The few people who come with helping hands are Thankachan, one of his students in the tuition centre, and Peter, who goes around finding him new jobs. In the meantime Bharathan invents a gadget {{that could be used to}} clean and sweep the courtyard and also to pluck coconuts and fruits from palms and trees.|$|R

500|$|In January 2015, Michael Doran of Newsarama and Graeme McMillian of The Hollywood Reporter had a [...] "point-counterpoint" [...] {{debate in}} {{response}} to the first Ant-Man trailer. Doran stated, [...] "Marvel has raised the bar [...] high that as opposed to just allowing another film to finish under the [...] bar, we're all overly and perhaps even eager to overreact to the first thing that doesn't clear it". McMillian responded, [...] "at this point, Marvel's brand is such that I'm not sure it can offer up something like [...] it seeming like a crushing disappointment ... part of Marvel's brand is that it [...] offer the kind of run-of-the-mill superhero movie that you're talking about, that it's ... at least different enough to tweak and play with the genre somehow ... The fact that there's such <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> trailer being ... well, okay ... suggests to me that the audience [...] expecting something to knock their socks off." [...] Doran concluded, [...] "That does seem to be the point here—the expectations fans now have for everything Marvel Studios ... Marvel [...] going to eventually falter." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{the novel}} Dogeaters was first {{published}} in 1990, the New York Times said that it was written with [...] "wit and originality" [...] Another critic argued that the novel is based on Filipino nationalism. In an interview with Ameena Meer, Hagedorn explains: “a lot of Filipinos were <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> that title. <b>This</b> sense of cultural shame came in. I had intended it as a metaphor. I should have fought the whole idea of trying to explain it, which they did on the book jacket. I didn’t want them to define it and I should have stood by my guns, because it’s been creating more trouble than necessary.” [...] Rachel Lee states that Dogeaters [...] "illustrates the transnational legacy of the United States imperialist practices." [...] The San Diego Union stated, [...] "Hagedorn transcends social strata, gender, culture, and politics in this exuberant, witty, and telling portrait of Philippine society." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{general manager}} {{who would be}} {{eventually}} successful in breaking the color barrier was Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Rickey himself had experienced the issue of segregation. While playing and coaching for his college team at Ohio Wesleyan University, Rickey had a black teammate named Charles Thomas. On one particular road trip through southern Ohio his fellow player was refused a room in a hotel. Although Rickey {{was able to get}} the player into his room for that night, he was taken aback when he reached his room to find Thomas <b>upset</b> and crying <b>about</b> <b>this</b> injustice. Rickey related this incident as an example of why he wanted a full de-segregation of the nation, not only in baseball.|$|R

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was {{critical}} of Emma in the show's second season. He said: [...] "Emma is apparently married, but we haven’t seen her husband since October, and {{even when he was}} more of a “fixture” on the show (which is difficult to say about a character who’s appeared as little as Carl Howell has), his relationship with Emma made no sense as anything other than a plot device. Now, as it turns out, Emma and Carl haven’t consummated their marriage at all, and this {{has something to do with}} the fact that the show has combined Emma’s germ-phobia and virginity into some sort of terrifying psychosexual pathology that doesn’t make much sense and doesn’t resemble the somewhat levelheaded person she used to be. (The plotting in Will Schuester’s love life is the one place where the show attempts to have even a modicum of continuity, for whatever reason.) Anyway, Carl is necessarily <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> and he’s also upset when Holly Holliday gets Emma to admit that she still has confusing feelings for Will, so he resolves to let her stay in the condo while he stays in the Radisson where all of the good big-name Glee guest stars go to hope their pilots for the fall are picked up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jamie Anne Allman {{spoke about}} the shock of {{learning}} that her character Terry Marek was Rosie Larsen's killer: [...] "Veena Sud had called me a couple hours before I was going in to read for the table read for episode 13, the last episode, that I was the killer. When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved." [...] This scene was in the Ogi Jun episode.|$|E
