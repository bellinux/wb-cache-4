The current photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are being replaced with thinner window, higher quantum efficiency, four-anode photomultiplier tubes. The new PMTs will provide better light detection performance, a significantly reduced background and unique handles to recover the signal in the presence of background.

40|$|Management’ at the {{business}} capitalism covers the vehicle of some aspects including the employee, course, service, network, and any kind of stuffs related to this case. In line with the system of business management, every single company might be in uniformity according to the common standard of capitalism despite having differences in the vision and mission. In this case, Waroeng Steak (WS) Restaurant in Demangan, Yogyakarta intentionally applied Islamic spiritual management. WS uses several kinds of teachings and trainings according to Islamic Sharia in the daily process. This concept concerns to the employees’ behavior <b>upgrading</b> and company <b>progression</b> through WS’ timeline program including daily, weekly, and annually activity striving for a great spiritual and economic orientation in the future. This paper argue despite the spiritual training for employees of WS might not be considered practical by capitalist standard, it is effective in bringing both spiritual and economic benefits to both company and {{all members of the}} staff. The research result that capitalism meet religion in terms of the production could lead to another standpoint at the collaborative intention in gaining positive benefit in successful business operation. Religion in regard to spiritual management in business has a significant role in bringing both individual upgrading in the class of devotion to God and the reflection to the good ethic in undergoing the working process, it is finally so-called a spiritual company that will be distinctively differ from the other existential companies...|$|R
40|$|Purpose We {{assessed}} {{whether an}} association exists between {{a change in}} prostate specific antigen and biopsy progression in men on active surveillance. Materials and Methods A cohort of patients undergoing active surveillance for prostate cancer was identified from the urological oncology database at our institution. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine whether prostate specific antigen velocity, defined as the change in ln(prostate specific antigen) per year, is associated with biopsy progression, defined as a Gleason <b>upgrade</b> or volume <b>progression</b> on repeat biopsy within 24 months of diagnosis. Results A total of 241 men with a mean ± SD age of 61 ± 7 years and mean prostate specific antigen 4. 9 ± 2. 2 ng/ml met study inclusion criteria. Median time to repeat biopsy was 10 months (IQR 613). Biopsy progression developed in 55 men (23 %), including a Gleason score upgrade in 46 (19 %), greater than 33 % positive cores in 11 (5 %) and greater than 50 % maximum single core positive in 12 (5 %). The median prostate specific antigen ratio per year was 1. 0 (IQR 0. 951. 03), although 1 man had a ratio of greater than 1. 26 (doubled over 3 years) and 7 had a ratio of less than 1 / 1. 26 (halved over 3 years). On multivariate analysis prostate specific antigen doubling within 3 years {{was associated with a}} 1. 4 -fold increase in the odds of biopsy progression (OR 1. 4, 95 % CI 0. 63. 4, p = 0. 46). Conclusions There is little change in prostate specific antigen during the first 24 months of surveillance in men with well staged, low risk prostate cancer. We believe that these findings highlight the importance of repeat biopsy during surveillance. © 2011 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc...|$|R
