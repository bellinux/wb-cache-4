5|$|Belgian plans did {{not call}} for the {{garrison}} of the fort and the attached defending forces to fight a sustained battle against an attacking force; {{it was assumed that}} sufficient warning of an attack would be given so that the detachment on {{the eastern side of the}} canal could be withdrawn, the bridges destroyed and the garrison ready to fight a delaying action. The defending force would then retire to the main defensive positions along the River Dyle, where they would link <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> Allied forces.|$|E

5|$|Mallards usually form pairs (in October and November in the Northern Hemisphere) {{until the}} female lays eggs {{at the start}} of the nesting season, which is around the {{beginning}} of spring. At this time she is left by the male who joins <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> males to await the moulting period, which begins in June (in the Northern Hemisphere). During the brief time before this, however, the males are still sexually potent and some of them either remain on standby to sire replacement clutches (for female mallards that have lost or abandoned their previous clutch, replacement clutch) or forcibly mate with females that appear to be isolated or unattached regardless of their species and whether or not they have a brood of ducklings.|$|E
5|$|The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, today {{known as}} DARPA) {{was formed in}} 1958 by President Dwight Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, in {{reaction}} to Soviet rocketry advances. US efforts had suffered from massive duplication of effort between the Army, Air Force, and Navy, {{and seemed to be}} accomplishing little in comparison to the Soviets. ARPA was initially handed the mission of overseeing all of these efforts. As the problems with Zeus became clear, McElroy also asked ARPA to consider the antimissile problem and come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> solutions. The resulting Project Defender was extremely broad in scope, considering everything from minor Zeus system upgrades to far-out concepts like antigravity and the recently invented laser.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen {{animated}} theatrical films {{based on}} the One Piece series have been released in Japan. The films are typically released in March {{in accordance with the}} spring vacation of Japanese schools. The films feature self-contained, completely original plots, or alternate retellings of story arcs with animation of a higher quality than what the weekly anime allows. The first three films were typically double features paired <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> anime films, and were thus, usually an hour or less in length. The films themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity. Funimation has licensed the eighth, tenth, and twelfth films for release in North America, and these films have received in-house dubs by the company.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Petrov's corps fought in the Battle of Białystok–Minsk. The corps was initially stationed in the rear but was moved forward to Baranovichi to stop the German advance, after the initial German breakthrough. On 26 June it fought defensive battles around Baranovichi, Stowbtsy, and Minsk, but the XLVII Army Corps (Motorized) managed to penetrate the corps' defenses. Outnumbered, the 17th Mechanized Corps was unable to offer much resistance to the attack and its remnants retreated eastwards to the Berezina, where they linked <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> Soviet units. It suffered heavy losses in the fighting and on 5 July {{became part of the}} 21st Army after being ordered to move to Babruysk on the previous day. By 7 July the corps had no armored vehicles left and later in the month the corps was withdrawn to the Sukhinichi area with the 4th Army.

5|$|In {{the face}} of German success against the Southwestern Front, {{including}} attempts by the Soviet 6th Army breaking out of the encirclement, Stavka ordered the Voronezh Front to relinquish control of the 3rd Tank Army to the Southwestern Front. To ease the transition, the 3rd Tank Army gave two rifle divisions to the 69th Army, and attacked south {{in a bid to}} destroy the SS Panzer Corps. However, low on fuel and ammunition after the march south, the 3rd Tank Army's offensive was postponed until 3 March. Furthermore, the 3rd Tank Army was harassed and severely damaged by continuous German aerial attacks with Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers. Launching its offensive on 3 March, the 3rd Tank Army's 15th Tank Corps struck into advancing units of the 3rd SS Panzer Division and immediately went to the defensive. Ultimately, the 3rd SS was able to pierce the 15th Tank Corps' lines and link <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> units of the same division advancing north, successfully encircling the Soviet tank corps. The 3rd Tank Army's 12th Tank Corps was also forced on the defensive immediately, after the 1st and 2nd SS Panzer Divisions threatened to cut off the 3rd Tank Army's supply route. By 5 March, the attacking 3rd Tank Army had been badly mauled, with {{only a small number of}} men able to escape northwards, and was forced to erect a new defensive line.|$|E
5|$|Raven Forward Air Controllers at Lima Site 20A, {{being the}} nearest {{available}} American support, were {{awakened by a}} radio call about 04:00. They flew in the dark to Lima Strip 36 at Na Khang to position themselves at the airstrip closest to LS85. The Ravens took up station over LS85 at dawn. At 05:15 Sullivan, from the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane, decided to evacuate Lima Site 85 and he gave a signal to U.S. pilots at Udorn to begin the operation, which was due to start at 07:15. However, Sullivan {{did not realize that}} U.S. technicians were no longer in control of their TSQ-81 equipment. Starting around 06:00, Pao's Hmong soldiers launched a counterattack against North Vietnamese positions at the communication center, which was guarded by Cells 1 and 2, but their attacks were repelled and the North Vietnamese held their positions. With the final Hmong counterattack on the communication site was defeated at 06:25, Cell 2 was ordered to support Cells 3 and 5 in their fight at the main TACAN installation. By 06:35, the North Vietnamese fully controlled the TACAN site. At the airstrip, Cell 4 was encircled by an estimated two Hmong platoons, but Chom and his unit were able to fight their way out by taking full advantage of rough terrain which favored them. Later, Cell 4 linked <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> units at the TACAN site.|$|E

5|$|The next British {{airborne}} unit to {{land was}} the 5th Parachute Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Nigel Poett. The brigade was designated {{to land on}} drop zoneB and achieved this, although not as accurately as 3rd Parachute Brigade due to poor visibility around the drop zone, which also {{made it more difficult}} for paratroopers of the brigade to rally. The drop zone came under heavy fire from German troops stationed nearby, and was subjected to shellfire and mortaring which inflicted casualties in the battalion rendezvous areas. However, the 7th Parachute Battalion soon cleared the DZ of German troops, many of whom were situated in farms and houses, and the 12th Parachute Battalion and 13th Parachute Battalion rapidly secured the rest of the brigade's objectives. The brigade was then ordered to move due east and clear an area near Schnappenberg, as well as to engage German forces gathered {{to the west of the}} farmhouse where the 6th Airborne Division Headquarters was established. By 15:30 Brigadier Poett reported that the brigade had secured all of its objectives and linked <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> British airborne units.|$|E
