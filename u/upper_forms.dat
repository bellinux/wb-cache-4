25|$|Under Abbot Theobald Grasböck {{the abbey}} {{secondary}} school (Gymnasium) was founded with facilities for boarding in 1895. At first it consisted only {{of a private}} lower school. In the school year 1903/04 the school was granted permission to accept state pupils. From the school year 1917/18 <b>upper</b> <b>forms</b> were added, and the first Matura examinations were held in 1922. In 1938 {{the school and the}} boarding-house were suspended by the National Socialist régime. After the war the school was immediately re-established, and re-opened in the autumn of 1945. In 1956 a new boarding-house wing was constructed. The school buildings were entirely re-developed in 1963. Girls have been admitted since 1980/81. The facilities for boarding were discontinued {{at the end of the}} academic year in 1990. Presently the school offers general education to approximately 450 boys and girls.|$|E

60|$|A sudden {{burst of}} {{enthusiastic}} cheering broke from the <b>upper</b> <b>forms.</b> Norris's innocence {{had been a}} matter of faith among his schoolfellows, and even his running away had not sufficed to shake their trust in him. They stood upon the forms and cheered until they were hoarse. At last a wave of the doctor's hand restored silence, and he went on.|$|E

When the head-master was seen to enter the School accompanied by a gentleman, a silence of surprise fell upon the boys, for such an event was altogether unprecedented there. As in the stranger, who stood nearly as tall and far broader than the doctor, many of the boys in the <b>upper</b> <b>forms</b> recognised Frank Norris, a buzz ran round the School, followed again by the silence of excited expectation. Dr. Litter walked to his table at the further end of the School and then turned.|$|E
40|$|Formal {{training}} {{in a second}} language (L 2) {{could be one of}} the essential factors for acquisition of the target language. In Malaysia, Malaysian University English Test (MUET) training is provided to pre-university students (Lower <b>Form</b> Six and <b>Upper</b> <b>Form</b> Six) in preparation for the actual test. However, does the amount of MUET training received by these L 2 learners influence their speaking performance? This study therefore aims to investigate if the amount of MUET training factor received by pre-university students significantly distinguish them with regard to their speaking performance. To this end, a speaking test was administered to seventy Malaysian pre-university students from two different intact classes (a group of 35 Lower Form Six and 35 <b>Upper</b> <b>Form</b> Six students). The results of the study revealed that the <b>Upper</b> <b>Form</b> Six students who received more exposure to MUET training obtained a significantly higher mean score than the Lower Form Six students in the speaking assessment. Hence, it can be concluded that MUET training provided to the Form Six students seems to have a significant influence on the L 2 learners’ speaking performanc...|$|R

60|$|Fred's figure, {{although}} less strongly built, was {{far more}} formed, and it was probable that years would effect but little change in it. There was a sinew and wire in his frame which would have told an athlete of great latent strength in the slight figure. His hair was light, his features clear and sharply cut, and the face a decidedly intellectual one. His manner was somewhat cold and restrained, but pleasant and courteous to men older than himself; both young fellows carried themselves well, with a certain ease of bearing, and that nameless air of command which distinguish most young men who have passed through the <b>upper</b> <b>forms</b> of a great public school.|$|E
60|$|The {{feeling of}} vexation thus engendered grew {{stronger}} with every circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between my rival and myself. I had not then discovered the remarkable {{fact that we}} were of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same height, and I perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touching a relationship, which had grown current in the <b>upper</b> <b>forms.</b> In a word, nothing could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulously concealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind, person, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I had {{no reason to believe that}} (with the exception of the matter of relationship, and in the case of Wilson himself,) this similarity had ever been made a subject of comment, or even observed at all by our schoolfellows. That he observed it in all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent; but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance, can only be attributed, as I said before, to his more than ordinary penetration.|$|E
60|$|A year passed, {{and when}} Philip {{came to the}} school the old masters were all in their places; but a good many changes had taken place {{notwithstanding}} their stubborn resistance, none the less formidable because it was concealed under an apparent desire to fall in with the new head's ideas. Though the form-masters still taught French to the lower school, another master had come, {{with a degree of}} doctor of philology from the University of Heidelberg and a record of three years spent in a French lycee, to teach French to the <b>upper</b> <b>forms</b> and German to anyone who cared to take it up instead of Greek. Another master was engaged to teach mathematics more systematically than had been found necessary hitherto. Neither of these was ordained. This was a real revolution, and when the pair arrived the older masters received them with distrust. A laboratory had been fitted up, army classes were instituted; they all said the character of the school was changing. And heaven only knew what further projects Mr. Perkins turned in that untidy head of his. The school was small as public schools go, there were not more than two hundred boarders; and it was difficult for it to grow larger, for it was huddled up against the Cathedral; the precincts, {{with the exception of a}} house in which some of the masters lodged, were occupied by the cathedral clergy; and there was no more room for building. But Mr. Perkins devised an elaborate scheme by which he might obtain sufficient space to make the school double its present size. He wanted to attract boys from London. He thought it would be good for them to be thrown in contact with the Kentish lads, and it would sharpen the country wits of these.|$|E

60|$|More than {{a quarter}} of a century has slipped by since then, and in the {{interval}} Milby has advanced at as rapid a pace as other market-towns in her Majesty's dominions. By this time it has a handsome railway station, where the drowsy London traveller may look out by the brilliant gas-light and see perfectly sober papas and husbands alighting with their leatherbags after transacting their day's business at the county town. There is a resident rector, who appeals to the consciences of his hearers with all the immense advantages of a divine who keeps his own carriage; the church is enlarged by at least five hundred sittings; and the grammar school, conducted on reformed principles, has its <b>upper</b> <b>forms</b> crowded with the genteel youth of Milby. The gentlemen there fall into no other excess at dinner-parties than the perfectly well-bred and virtuous excess of stupidity; and though the ladies are still said sometimes to take too much upon themselves, they are never known to take too much in any other way. The conversation is sometimes quite literary, for there is a flourishing book-club, and many of the younger ladies have carried their studies so far as to have forgotten a little German. In short, Milby is now a refined, moral, and enlightened town; no more resembling the Milby of former days than the huge, long-skirted, drab great-coat that embarrassed the ankles of our grandfathers resembled the light paletot in which we tread jauntily through the muddiest streets, or than the bottle-nosed Britons, rejoicing over a tankard, in the old sign of the Two Travellers at Milby, resembled the severe-looking gentleman in straps and high collars whom a modern artist has represented as sipping the imaginary port of that well-known commercial house.|$|E
60|$|I {{know very}} little of the {{practical}} teaching of English, my own very fragmentary knowledge of the more familiar clichés of our tongue was acquired in a haphazard fashion, but I am inclined to think that in addition to much reading aloud and recitation from memory the work of instruction might consist very largely of continually more extensive efforts towards original composition. Paraphrasing is a good exercise, provided that it does not consist in turning good and beautiful English into bad. I do not see why it should not follow the reverse direction. Selected passages of mean, stereotyped, garrulous or inexact prose might very well be rewritten, under the direction of an intelligent master. Retelling a story that has just been read and discussed, with a change of incident perhaps, would also not be a bad sort of exercise, writing passages in imitation of set passages and the like. Written descriptions of things displayed to a class should also be instructive. Caught at the right age, most little girls, and many little boys I believe, would learn very pleasantly to write simple verse. This they should be encouraged to read aloud. At a later stage the more settled poetic forms, the ballade, the sonnet, the rondeau, for example, should afford a good practice in handling language. Pupils should be encouraged to import fresh words into their work--even if the effect is a little startling at times--they should hunt the dictionary for material. A good book for the <b>upper</b> <b>forms</b> in schools dealing in a really intelligent and instructive way with Latin and Greek, so far as it is necessary to know these languages in order to use and manipulate technical English freely, would, I conceive, be of very great service. It must be a good exercise to write precise definitions of words. Logic also is an integral portion of the study of the mother-tongue.|$|E
