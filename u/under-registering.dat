50|$|Problems {{associated}} with metering arise {{particularly in the}} case of intermittent supply, which is common in many developing countries. Sudden changes in pressure can damage meters to the extent that many meters in cities in developing countries are not functional. Also, some types of meters become less accurate as they age, and <b>under-registering</b> consumption leads to lower revenues if defective meters are not regularly replaced. Many types of meters also register air flows, which can lead to over-registration of consumption, especially in systems with intermittent supply, when water supply is re-established and the incoming water pushes air through the meters.|$|E
40|$|Malaria is a {{worldwide}} public health problem; parasites from the genus Plasmodium are the aetiological agent for this disease. The parasites are mostly diagnosed by conventional microscopy-based techniques; however, their limitations {{have led to}} <b>under-registering</b> the reported prevalence of Plasmodium species. This study has thus been aimed at evaluating the infection and coinfection prevalence of 3 species of Plasmodium spp., {{in an area of}} the Colombian Amazon region. Blood samples were taken from 671 symptomatic patients by skin puncture; a nested PCR amplifying the 18 S ssRNA region was used on all samples to determine the presence of P. vivax, P. malariae and P. falciparum. Statistical analysis determined infection and coinfection frequency; the association between infection and different factors was established. The results showed that P. vivax was the species having the greatest frequency in the study population (61. 4 %), followed by P. malariae (43. 8 %) and P. falciparum (11. 8 %). The study revealed that 35. 8 % of the population had coinfection, the P. vivax/P. malariae combination occurring most frequently (28. 3 %); factors such as age, geographical origin and clinical manifestations were found to be associated with triple-infection. The prevalence reported in this study differed from previous studies in Colombia; the results suggest that diagnosis using conventional techniques could be giving rise to underestimating some Plasmodium spp. species having high circulation rates in Colombia (particularly in the Colombian Amazon region). The present study's results revealed a high prevalence of P. malariae and mixed infections in the population being studied. The results provide relevant information which should facilitate updating the epidemiological panorama and species' distribution so as to include control, prevention and follow-up measures...|$|E

40|$|Birth {{registration}} and obtaining physical birth certificates impose major challenges in developing countries, with impact on child and community health, education, planning, and {{all levels of}} development. However despite initiatives, universal registration is elusive, leading to calls for new approaches to understanding the decisions of parents. In this paper, we report results of a survey of students in grades six to eight (age ~ 12 - 16) in an <b>under-registered</b> area of Kenya regarding their own understanding of registration issues and their suggestions for improvement. These students were selected because they themselves were also nearing the age for high school enrollment/entrance examinations, which specifically requires possession of a birth certificate. This assessment was also a companion to our previous representative survey of adults in the same Kenyan region, allowing for parent-child comparison. Results supported previous research, showing that only 43 % had birth certificates. At the same time, despite these low totals, students were themselves quite aware of registration factors and purposes. The students also made quite prescient sources for understanding their households' motivations, with many of their suggestions-for focus on communication of pragmatic benefits, or automatic measures shifting responsibility from parents-mirroring our own previous suggestions, and showing a level of pragmatism not witnessed when surveying their parents. This paper therefore adds evidence to the discussion of registration policy planning. More generally, it also builds on an important trend regarding the treatment of children as stakeholders and important sources of information, and raising an intriguing new avenue for future research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Sarcomas are a {{heterogeneous}} group of malignant neoplasms arising from mesenchymal cells which encompass dozens of histological types and {{can occur in}} virtually any anatomic site. They form {{one of the principal}} groups of rare cancers in Europe as defined in the RARECARE project. We analysed 45, 568 incident cases diagnosed during 1995 – 2002 and registered by 76 population-based cancer registries. Total crude incidence was 5. 6 per 100, 000 per year with an estimated 27, 908 new cases per year in the EU 27 countries, of which 84 % were soft tissue sarcomas and 14 % were bone sarcomas. Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) were only widely recognised as an entity in the late 1990 s and consequently were <b>under-registered.</b> Their true incidence is believed to be about 1. 5 per 100, 000. Age-standardised incidence of soft tissue sarcomas ranged from 3. 3 per 100, 000 in Eastern Europe to 4. 7 per 100, 000 in Northern Europe. About 280, 000 persons were estimated to be alive at the beginning of 2003 with a past diagnosis of sarcoma, of which 83 % were soft tissue sarcomas and 16 % were bone sarcomas. Five-year relative survival for 2000 – 2002 by the period was 58 % for soft tissue sarcomas and 62 % for bone sarcomas. The diversity and rarity of sarcomas combined with the quite large number of people affected by them mean that they provide a classic example of the importance of networking in diagnosis, therapy and research for rare cancers...|$|R
40|$|Apparent losses form an {{important}} component of the International Water Association's water balance. While apparent losses look like real losses to a municipality, this is not actually the case. The main components of apparent losses are water meter under-registration and unauthorised consumption. Water utilities in South Africa and internationally are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of good meter management practices based on the vast amount of literature published and work done by municipalities in recent years. Water meters are known to increasingly <b>under-register</b> as they age and register consumption. They register consumption the least accurate at low flowrates and their accuracy in this range deteriorates the fastest. This study investigates the extent of the apparent loss problem in selected areas of South Africa due to meter inaccuracy in a number of different ways, including an inspection of new residential consumer meters, interrogation of a metering database, flow logging of domestic consumers with and without an Unmeasured Flow Reducer (UFR) installed and a compilation of reports on bulk consumer meters. It was found that 16 % of 402 properties investigated in the City of Cape Town had an on-site leakage and their median flowrate was 10 litres/ hour. In Bloemfontein, it was found that 28 % of the 167 properties investigated had an on-site leakage with a median flowrate of 20 l/h. An investigation into the performance of 15 mm positive displacement meters based on eThekwini's water meter database showed that the under-registration from these meters increase by 0. 36 %-points per year and 0. 9 %-points per 1000 kL registered. Flow logging of domestic consumers with and without UFRs, showed that there was no genuine improvement in meter accuracy with meters that had UFRs installed in-line with it. However, there were only 8 properties (3 of which having a UFR installed) in the study that were investigated and no statistical conclusive conclusions could be made. Bulk meter audits in Ekurhuleni and Tshwane showed apparent losses of 18 % and 19 % respectively...|$|R
