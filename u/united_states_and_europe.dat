5|$|In 1849 James Goodhue began {{publication}} of the Minnesota Pioneer newspaper in Saint Paul (the paper would later be renamed the St. Paul Pioneer Press). By the time the area achieved statehood 89 newspapers had been established. Information about Minnesota published in these periodicals spread throughout the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe.</b> Advertising campaigns were launched in the northeastern U.S. and Europe to lure European settlers. These efforts met with limited success though they would become much more successful after statehood.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Commodore Matthew Perry led the Perry Expedition, a {{squadron}} of four ships which sailed to Japan to establish normal relations with Japan. Perry's two technologically advanced steam-powered ships and calm, firm diplomacy convinced Japan to end three centuries of isolation and sign Treaty of Kanagawa with the U.S. in 1854.

5|$|The {{period of}} Daylight Saving Time before the longest day is {{shorter than the}} period after, in several {{countries}} including the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe.</b> This unequal split is an energy saving measure.

The period for Daylight Saving Time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.|$|E

5|$|Throughout June {{and into}} July 1944, {{material}} from the Vrba–Wetzler and earlier reports appeared in newspapers and radio broadcasts in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe,</b> particularly in Switzerland, prompting world leaders to appeal to Hungarian regent Miklós Horthy to halt the deportations. On 7 July 1944, Horthy ordered an end to them, possibly fearing he would be held responsible after the war. By then 437,000 Jews had been deported, constituting almost the entire Jewish population of the Hungarian countryside, but another 200,000 in Budapest were saved.|$|E

5|$|Five {{medications}} {{have evidence}} for long-term use orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine–topiramate, and naltrexone–bupropion. They result in weight loss {{after one year}} ranged from 3.0 to 6.7kg over placebo. Orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe,</b> whereas lorcaserin and phentermine–topiramate are available only in the United States. European regulatory authorities rejected the latter two drugs {{in part because of}} associations of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate. Orlistat use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys. There is no information on how these drugs affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death.|$|E

As of 2009, the International Species Information System (ISIS) recorded only six remaining individuals registered in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe,</b> all reclassified as northern giant mouse lemurs and considered a non-breeding population; and in 2015, only a single female remained on record.|$|E

5|$|Leave Home is {{the second}} studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones. It was {{released}} on January 10, 1977, through Sire Records, with the expanded CD being released through Rhino Entertainment on June 19, 2001.

The album had a higher production value than their debut Ramones and featured faster tempos. The front photo was taken by Moshe Brakha and the back cover, which would become the band's logo, was designed by Arturo Vega. The album spawned three singles, but only one succeeded in charting.

5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{stationary}} weather ship was proposed as early as 1921 by Météo-France to help support shipping and the coming of transatlantic aviation. They were used during World War II but had no means of defense, {{which led to the}} loss of several ships and many lives. On the whole, the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II for Europe and North America that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established a global network of weather ships in 1948, with 13 to be supplied by Canada, the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe.</b> This number was eventually negotiated down to nine. The agreement of the use of weather ships by the international community ended in 1985.|$|E
