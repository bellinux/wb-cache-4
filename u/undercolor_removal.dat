40|$|Most {{present day}} color scanners, with red, green, and blue filters, are non-colorimetric. This means that their outputs cannot be linearly {{transformed}} into CIE tristimulus values for arbitrary input materials. On the other hand, by restricting oneself {{to a single}} class of inputs such as photographic, lithographic, or xerographic materials, very accurate scanner calibrations are possible. In this paper, we conjecture that such accurate calibrations can be achieved if the input document is made with only "three colorants", i. e., has only three independent degrees of freedom. The validity of the above conjecture is tested experimentally using a CMYK (four colorant) printer. Usually in CMYK printing, {{there are only three}} fundamental degrees of freedom. Even though four colorants are used, the amounts of these colorants are inter-related through the method used for <b>undercolor</b> <b>removal</b> (UCR). The fourth degree of freedom is re-introduced when the method of <b>undercolor</b> <b>removal</b> is varied. To tes [...] ...|$|E
40|$|When {{typesetting}} a color {{book the}} goal is to produce a separate printer plate for each of the colors. The process of splitting the printed output into separate plates is called color separation. There are two color separation methods commonly used. Custom color separation selects colors from a standard pallet. A different plate is created for each color in the book. Process color separation separates the colors into the subtractive color components cyan, magenta and yellow, and creates a separate black plate by a process called <b>undercolor</b> <b>removal.</b> These four plates are used by a printing press to mix the colors on paper when the book is printed. Color separation is a more involved process than simply assigning RGB values to a desktop color printer. This article addresses the issues of professional color separation, and demonstrates how T E X with a suitable dvi driver can be used to produce quality custom and process color books...|$|E
40|$|Members of {{the graphic}} arts {{industries}} are slowly {{becoming aware of}} undercolor reduction techniques used {{in the attempt to}} help stabilize high speed wet printing. <b>Undercolor</b> <b>removal</b> is a color correction method which follows this line of thought as it reduces the amount of ink coverage by the process-color inks and increases ink coverage of the black printer in the darker neutral areas of a reproduction. The advantages realized by this technique are carried even further with gray-component replacement (GCR). GCR removes the process color inks that make up a dark tone and replaces them with black ink in both neutral and color regions of a reproduction. This separation method provides technical and cost benefits to the printer. An investigation of this reproduction technique forms the basis of this research project. A comparison was made between the quality performance of gray-component replacement techniques and the traditional four-color reproduction method. It was found through visual subjective testing, while not all the tone reproduction criteria favored the traditional four-color reproduction method, color and print contrast were affected by the use of gray-component replacement...|$|E
40|$|A type {{of black}} printer that only existed in theory {{is now being}} applied in the {{printing}} industry. The process which makes use of this black printer is known as gray-component replacement. Developed from {{the extension of the}} <b>undercolor</b> <b>removal</b> process, the use of gray-component replacement in printing halftone reproductions is said to result in numerous technical and cost benefits. When used to the maximum, the process eliminates one of the three process color inks in a given unit area and prints black ink from highlight to shadow. A problem can result from the use of this process as it applies a greater amount of an opaque black ink in combination with selectively transparent colored inks. Where this black ink overprints {{one or more of the}} three colored inks there will be an increase in unwanted absorption and a decrease in the wanted absorption. The result of such overprinting will be the alteration of the reflectance curve of the reproduction as compared to the original with the result being a shift in hue. An experiment was performed to demonstrate the principles. Several tint patches were printed with the only difference between each patch being the location of black ink overprinting within the tint. It could be seen by visual analysis that a hue shift did occur. Sample tint patches were analyzed by means of a spectrophotometer to objectively describe the visual results...|$|E
40|$|Due to some {{inherent}} advantages, rotated dot screens are {{the most}} common halftoning method. The color re-production of rotated dot schemes is more robust with respect to mis-registration errors than color reproduc-tion using other halftoning schemes (e. g., dot-on-dot or dot-off-dot). In order to achieve good overall print qual-ity, however, the angles between the different color sepa-rations have to be precisely controlled, or moiré will occur. This precise control of the screen angles is gener-ally not possible in digital systems with their inherent discrete resolution. At the high resolutions commonly used in offset printing (e. g., ≥ 2400 × 2400 dpi), the dis-crete nature of the screen is normally not a critical is-sue. The problem persists, however, at resolutions commonly found in xerographic printers. Because moiré is a strong function of the relative screen angles, especially of the c,m,k separations, many approaches have been explored for mitigating moiré pat-terns via halftone screen and screen angle design. How-ever, as will be shown in this paper, moiré is also a strong function of the geometry of the individual halftone dot, specifically the dot area coverage of the halftone dot. It is this dependence that is described and exploited in this paper. More specifically, a method is described that reduces the c,m,k moiré by using a variable <b>undercolor</b> <b>removal</b> (UCR) and gray component replacement (GCR) scheme for a given halftone screen. Preliminary work was published in a conference proceeding. 10 This article is a more detailed and complete description of the work. Modeling Moiré In Color Printing The effect of moiré in color printing has long been known and has led to the common color layout of using cyan and magenta at plus and minus 15 °, black, or key, at 45 ° and yellow at 0 °. In this scenario, cyan, magenta and black use the identical screen frequencies. In this way, the interaction, or moiré, between cyan and ma-genta has identical frequency and orientation as the black separation. The result is a zero frequency moir...|$|E
