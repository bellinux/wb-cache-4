5|$|After the service, some people—regular {{faithful}} or visitors—may ask {{to consult}} a healer {{in one of}} the small rooms of the temple—although the desservant who lives in the apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both are standing before Antoine's image: the patient expresses for a few minutes the request that he wishes to obtain, and the healer prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably to convey the fluid. The healer's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing. For this purpose, the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.|$|E

Although he does not fully <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is not the fayth dream, Tidus feels that disappearing would be preferable to making Yuna cry again. The novel Final Fantasy X-2.5 ~Eien no Daishou~, set after Final Fantasy X-2, explores Tidus and Yuna's visit to Besaid Island 1,000 years before. The HD remastered version of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster, adds an audio drama (Final Fantasy X: Will) in which Tidus is a new blitzball star {{who appears to be}} concealing an injury. After Yuna breaks up with him, Tidus helps her on a quest to defeat a reborn Sin. Tidus' disappearance between Final Fantasy X and its sequel will be explained in the game, Mobius Final Fantasy.|$|E

Mourinho sentiments were later echoed by incoming France national team coach Laurent Blanc who acknowledged that Benzema was [...] "not used to working".

500|$|The United States Supreme Court first {{clarified}} {{the applicability}} of the Fourth Amendment to searches and seizures on buses in the 1991 case Florida v. Bostick, where the Court held that police officers may approach bus passengers on a random basis and ask questions and request their consent to searches, [...] "provided a reasonable person would <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> or she is free to refuse". The Court rejected the argument that police questioning on board a bus constitutes a per se seizure under the Fourth Amendment, and instead held that courts should use a [...] "totality of the circumstances" [...] test to determine whether a passenger would have felt [...] "free to decline the officers' requests or otherwise terminate the encounter", or whether a passenger was free [...] "to ignore the police presence and go about his business". Additionally, the Court ruled that even if law enforcement officers have no basis for suspecting individuals are engaged in criminal activity, officers may still approach passengers, ask them questions, request identification, and request consent to search luggage, so long as officers do not coerce passengers to cooperate with their efforts.|$|E

Following the video's VEVO release, Monica Herrera of Billboard named Eminem's jumping sequence [...] "a moment of triumph" [...] and compared his flying scene to Superman. She also noted similarities of the video's {{events and the}} song's lyrics, deeming them a powerful word to Eminem's haters, where Eminem raps about destroying one's balcony. Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone felt that Eminem [...] "similarly puts his redemption in the spotlight" [...] and notices courage. Kreps went on to compare Eminem's flying scene to Canadian actor Keanu Reeves from the 1999 science fiction film The Matrix. In his review for Entertainment Weekly, Vozick-Levinson wrote: [...] "We are to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is once again at wit's end with the world, full of barely contained energy that he's not yet sure how to direct." [...] Although he didn't feel that the video was Eminem's best, Vozick-Levinson praised the video for its message {{in relation to the}} song's vibe; he also made a comparison to Eminem's music video for [...] "The Way I Am", as both videos involve Eminem as he jumps from a great height. Patrick D'Arcy of Spin thought that Eminem is [...] "an satria unlikely motivational speaker, but an effective one." ...|$|E

500|$|The British {{merchant}} {{class in}} Jamaica that had shunned MacGregor {{on his first}} arrival in 1812 now welcomed him as a hero. The Scotsman entertained many dinner parties with embellished accounts of his part in the Cartagena siege, leading some to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had personally headed the city's defence. One Englishman toasted the [...] "Hannibal of modern Carthage". Around New Year 1816, MacGregor and his wife {{made their way to}} Santo Domingo (today the Dominican Republic), where Bolívar was raising a new army. Bolívar received MacGregor back into the Venezuelan Army with the rank of brigadier-general, and included him in an expeditionary force that left Aux Cayes (now Les Cayes) on 30 April 1816. MacGregor took part in the capture of the port town of Carúpano as second-in-command of Manuel Piar's column, but is not mentioned in the record of the battle prepared by Bolívar's staff. After the Spanish were driven from many central Venezuelan towns, MacGregor was sent to the coast west of Caracas to recruit native tribesmen in July 1816. On 18 July, eight days after the numerically superior royalists countered and broke Bolívar's main force at La Cabrera, MacGregor resolved to retreat hundreds of miles east to Barcelona.|$|E
500|$|The {{protagonist of}} Final Fantasy XII, Vaan is a 17-year-old {{orphaned}} street urchin {{who lost his}} parents in a plague when he was 12 years old. His only brother, Reks, died two {{years prior to the}} start of the game, during the Archadian invasion of Dalmasca. He makes a living as Migelo's assistant, running various errands for him, while at the same time pickpocketing from Archadian soldiers while claiming to take back what is Dalmasca's. He is a cheerful and energetic boy. Vaan dreams of someday becoming a sky pirate in command of his own airship. He trains to meet this goal by killing dire rats in the sewers of Rabanastre on a daily basis, for which Dalan gave him the nickname [...] "Vaan Ratsbane." [...] Despite nominally being the protagonist, the majority of the game focuses on the events and conflicts of the world as a whole and of Ashe, rather than Vaan's individual problems, with his character instead used as a narrative device to allow the player to follow the events as an outside observer. During the course of the game, Vaan comes to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has spent his time running from his problems and blaming the Archadian empire for them, rather than moving on with his life after his brother and parents' deaths. Vaan ends the game as a sky pirate, traveling the world along with Penelo. He also reprises his role from Final Fantasy XII in the manga adaptation by Gin Amou.|$|E
500|$|Following the Mighty Ducks' Stanley Cup run, Kariya {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free {{agent in the}} off-season. With Kariya requiring a $10 million qualifying offer from Anaheim to remain with the team, General Manager Bryan Murray let him go to free agency. Murray went on record saying, [...] "We <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is an important player for the franchise...but when {{you are trying to}} build a team it's hard to have one player at $10 million when your payroll is the mid to low ($40 million range)." [...] It was reported that the team had tried negotiating a longer-term deal with a decreased salary, while Murray told media {{at the time that he}} would remain in negotiations with Kariya to sign him for less. With former linemate Teemu Selänne also entering unrestricted free agency that summer after three years with San Jose (he decided to opt out of his final year, valued at $6.5 million), the duo agreed to reunite and sign with the same team. Together, they approached the Colorado Avalanche, having decided the team had the best chance of winning the Stanley Cup. On July 3, 2003, the Avalanche announced the signing of Kariya and Selänne to one-year contracts. In order for the team to afford both players, Kariya took an $8.8 million paycut from his $10 million salary with Anaheim the previous year, marking the highest decrease in compensation for a player in NHL history. At $1.2 million, his salary was below the NHL average, ensuring that he would have the freedom of unrestricted free agency at the end of the season. Selänne, meanwhile, signed for $5.8 million. Their deals were partially facilitated by goaltender Patrick Roy's retirement, which freed up $8.5 million in salary.|$|E

The narrator then leaves the beast, unable to be in its presence as it continues to suffer. He later learns that it was stripped, nearly to the bone, within hours. His elderly colleagues agree that killing the elephant was the best thing to do, but the younger ones believe that it was worth more than the Indian it killed.
