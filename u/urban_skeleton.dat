40|$|Obvious data {{consistency}} {{degree is}} not high in roads or habitation data, {{often in the}} presence of large geometric position deviation, which is not conducive to improve the accuracy and efficiency of road or habitation matching. A linkage matching method for road and habitation by using <b>urban</b> <b>skeleton</b> line network is proposed to solve this problem. The linkage matching imitates the human thinking process of searching for target objects by the signal features and spatial correlation when reading maps, regarding matching as a reasoning process of goal feature searching and information association transmitting. Firstly, <b>urban</b> <b>skeleton</b> line network is constructed by constraint Delaunay triangulation network; then, the topological relationship among road, skeleton line, skeleton line mesh, habitation is constructed; last, matching transmission model is established by the topological relationship. According to this matching transmission model, linkage matching is fulfilled, which contains road matching drives habitation matching or habitation matching drives road matching. The advantage of this method is that {{as long as there is}} an element of data consistency is good, can drive another element to obtain a very good matching effect, at the same time conform to the human cognitive process...|$|E

Will Stefanov of Arizona State University will present the first set of ASTER images of the <b>urban</b> <b>skeleton</b> of the amount of built structures in 12 cities around the world and discuss the Urban Environmental Monitoring project which will examine 100 urban centers to look for common features (or lack of them) in global city structure and monitor change over time.

40|$|The {{existing}} matching {{methods for}} the multi-source road {{data of the}} same scale mainly consider {{the characteristics of the}} road itself, while the effect of the neighborhood features on matching process is generally ignored, which may restrict the further improvement of the matching results. This restriction can be more obvious for the matching data in which the location or rotation differences still exist after the system error rectification. A road network matching method that takes the similarity of the roads' neighborhood habitation cluster into consideration is proposed, which draws on the experience of the human spatial cognitive characteristics for the unfamiliar environment. Firstly, the neighborhood habitation cluster of the road is extracted by the <b>urban</b> <b>skeleton</b> line network; Then by calculating the spatial relation similarity and geometry characteristic similarity of the neighborhood habitation cluster, the matching results can be obtained. The advantage of this method is that for the road data which have obvious location or rotation differences, the similarity of their neighborhood habitation clusters can be treated as a proper matching index. Actually, roads' neighborhood habitation cluster can be a constraint of the road matching process and enhance its robustness. The tests and comparison analysis indicate that this method can solve the matching problems of the road data which still have obvious location or rotation differences after system error rectification and improve the matching correctness...|$|E
30|$|The {{planning}} and development of urban underground space {{are closely related to}} the construction of urban rail transit. Generally, urban rail transit stations are chosen to be built in the center and subcentral area of the city, with the function of connecting each city block and forming the <b>urban</b> underground space <b>skeleton.</b> Therefore, as the core of urban public transport, urban rail transit can be used {{as the basis for the}} development and utilization of urban underground space. Moreover, the construction of rail transit stations can also bring opportunities for the efficient and economical use of land resources for the development of urban underground space [7]. As early as the beginning of 1990 s, Guangzhou began to carry out large-scale urban rail transit construction and paid great attention to the development of underground space in the surrounding areas. In order to make full use of the multi-function of underground space, a systematic development pattern has been formed, which is based on urban rail transit stations, supplemented by underground space development such as underground civil air defense works, underground commerce, underground parking, underground evacuation channels, and utility tunnel [8]. Song et al. [9] combined engineering projects in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen to analyze the necessity and feasibility of urban rail transit in driving the development of underground space, and pointed out that the scale of underground space development is a key research topic for underground space development in future rail transit station areas. Xiao et al. [10] in their research on the large-scale development and utilization of underground space for urban rail transit specifically pointed out that the structural space constructed by saving engineering investment and intensively using resources replaced traditional earthwork backfilling. As well as the underground space above the subway station platform or on the same floor as the station hall due to the need for deep excavation required by the subway construction method, it is located between the main body of the station and the surrounding buildings, the municipal road or the green space, and the comprehensive underground space with parking, connectivity, or commercial functions belongs to the scale of the underground space in the urban rail transit station area. Guo and Wang [11] analyzed the factors affecting the surrounding space environment factors of Beijing Metro Line 13 and considered that from a range point of view, the urban space around the rail transit station generally refers to the range of the station as the center radius 500 – 600  m or adjacent neighborhood. According to their location and functional categories of the city, they are divided into four types: hub space, public center space, residential space, and urban edge space. Nie and Wang [12] discussed the combined mode of rail transit and urban land, used planning, and pointed out that rail stations have great influence on the development of underground space. According to the different influences of the rail transit key stations, general stations and their hinterland and light rail stations on the development demand, the corresponding underground space influences are also different. Among them, the underground space of the key stations has an impact scope of about 500  m, and for the other three types of stations, the scope of influence of underground space diminishes in turn.|$|R
