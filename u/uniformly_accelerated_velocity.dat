40|$|We {{show that}} {{standard}} Relativistic Dynamics Equation F=dp/dτ is only partially covariant. To achieve full Lorentz covariance, we replace the four-force F by a rank 2 antisymmetric tensor {{acting on the}} four-velocity. By taking this tensor to be constant, we obtain a covariant definition of <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> motion. We compute explicit solutions for <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> motion which are divided into four types: null, linear, rotational, and general. For null acceleration, the worldline is cubic in the time. Linear acceleration covariantly extends 1 D hyperbolic motion, while rotational acceleration covariantly extends pure rotational motion. We use Generalized Fermi-Walker transport to construct a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> family of inertial frames which are instantaneously comoving to a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> observer. We explain the connection between our approach and that of Mashhoon. We show that our solutions of <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> motion have constant acceleration in the comoving frame. Assuming the Weak Hypothesis of Locality, we obtain local spacetime transformations from a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> frame K' to an inertial frame K. The spacetime transformations between two <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> frames with the same acceleration are Lorentz. We compute the metric at an arbitrary point of a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> frame. We obtain velocity and acceleration transformations from a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> system K' to an inertial frame K. We derive the general formula for the time dilation between accelerated clocks. We obtain a formula for the angular <b>velocity</b> of a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> object. Every rest point of K' is <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated,</b> and its acceleration {{is a function of}} the observer's acceleration and its position. We obtain an interpretation of the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation as an acceleration transformation from K' to K. Comment: 36 page...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{emission}} of a Minkowski particle by a general class of scalar sources as described by inertial observers corresponds to either the emission or the absorption of a Rindler particle as described by <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> observers. Our results are discussed {{in connection with the}} current controversy whether <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> detectors radiate. 04. 62. +v, 04. 70. Dy 1 There is currently a discussion about what is the influence that accelerated detectors have on the quantum field to which it is coupled [1]–[6]. Raine et al [2] and Massar et al [4] have argued that a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> oscillator does not radiate. This is in contrast to Unruh and Wald’s result [7] that the absorption of a Rindler particle by a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> Unruh-DeWitt detector [8]-[9] corresponds to the emission of a Minkowski particle. This controversy recalls the classical discussion whether <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> electric charges radiate [10].

40|$|Radiation from {{a mirror}} moving in vacuum {{electromagnetic}} fields {{is shown to}} vanish {{in the case of}} a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> motion. Such motions are related to conformal coordinate transformations, which preserve correlation functions characteristic of vacuum fluctuations. As a result, vacuum fluctuations remain invariant under reflection upon a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> mirror, which therefore does not radiate and experiences no radiation reaction force. Mechanical effects of vacuum fluctuations thus exhibit an invariance with respect to <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> motions. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} old {{question}} of whether or not a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> charged particle radiates, and consequently, if weak equivalence principle is violated by electrodynamics. We show that radiation has different meanings; some absolute, some relative. Detecting photons or electromagnetic waves is not absolute, it depends both on the electromagnetic field and on the state of motion of the antenna. An antenna used by a Rindler observer does not detect any radiation from a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> co-moving charged particle. Therefore, a Rindler observer cannot decide whether or not he is in an accelerated lab or in a gravitational field. We also discuss the general case.

40|$|Derived from semi-{{classical}} {{quantum field}} theory in curved spacetime, Unruh effect {{was known as a}} quantum effect. We find that there does exist a classical correspondence of this effect in electrodynamics. The thermal nature of the vacuum in correlation function for the <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> detector is coming from the non-linear relationship between the proper time and the propagating length of the electromagnetic wave. Both the Coulomb field of the detector itself and the radiation supporting the detector's <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerating</b> motion contribute to the non-vanishing vacuum energy. From this observation we conclude that Unruh temperature experienced by a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> classical electron has no additional effects to Born's solution for laboratory observers far away from the classical electron.
