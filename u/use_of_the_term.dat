5|$|The first {{documented}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Primitivo {{appears in}} Italian governmental publications of the 1870s. The name {{derives from the}} terms primativus or primaticcio, which refer to the grape's tendency to ripen earlier than other varieties. This name's appearance, 40 {{years after the first}} documented <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Zinfandel, was previously thought to suggest that Primitivo was introduced to Italy from across the Atlantic; however, this hypothesis has become unlikely since the discovery of the vine's Croatian origin.|$|E

5|$|Agnosticism is criticized from {{a variety}} of standpoints. Some {{religious}} thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to materialism. Some atheists criticize the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.|$|E
5|$|The {{denominations}} in the Latter Day Saint {{movement are}} sometimes collectively {{referred to as}} Mormonism. Although some denominations opposed {{the use of this}} term because they consider it to be derogatory, it is especially used when referring to the largest Latter Day Saint group, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and offshoots of it. Denominations opposed to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> consider it to be connected to the polygamy once practiced by the Utah church.|$|E
5|$|The second-largest {{denomination}} is the Community of Christ (first {{named the}} Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) from 1872 to 2001), a Missouri-based, 250,000-member denomination. Though {{members of this}} church have traditionally been called Latter Day Saints (without the hyphen), the Community of Christ has more recently stated that it rejects the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Saints as a designation for its members in any official reference or publication.|$|E

5|$|The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> bhakti, meaning devotion, is not {{confined}} to any one deity. However, Krishna is an important and popular focus of the devotionalism tradition within Hinduism, particularly among the Vaishnava sects. Devotees of Krishna subscribe to the concept of lila, meaning 'divine play', as the central principle of the universe. It is a form of bhakti yoga, one of three types of yoga discussed by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
5|$|Advertising {{standards}} laws in many jurisdictions {{prohibit the}} use of the phrase kosher in a product's labelling unless the producer can show that the product conforms to Jewish dietary laws; however, different jurisdictions often define the legal qualifications for conforming to Jewish dietary laws differently. For example, in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the kashrut nature, in others the rules of kosher are fully defined in law, and in others still it is sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with Jewish dietary regulations. In several cases, laws restricting the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> kosher have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} famous of these bird artists was John James Audubon, whose {{paintings}} of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the National Audubon Society. Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, Homer incorporated nightingales into his Odyssey, and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2. The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which led to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> as a metaphor for a 'burden'. Other English metaphors derive from birds; vulture funds and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there are}} several {{historical}} <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> that provide some background as to its meaning.|$|R

500|$|<b>The</b> first {{recorded}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> short scale (...) and long scale (...) {{was by the}} French mathematician Geneviève Guitel in 1975.|$|R
5|$|It was de Jussieu in 1789 {{who first}} {{formally}} created a 'family' (Narcissi), as the seventh 'Ordo' (Order) {{of the third}} class (Stamina epigyna) of Monocots in which Narcissus and 15 other genera were placed. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Ordo {{at that time was}} closer to what we now understand as Family, rather than Order. The family has undergone much reorganisation since then, but in 1805 it was renamed after a different genus in the family, Amaryllis, as 'Amaryllideae' by Jaume St.-Hilaire and has retained that association since. Jaume St.-Hilaire divided the family into two unnamed sections and recognised five species of Narcissus, omitting N. serotinus.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Wicca within contemporary Paganism {{has been a}} recurring topic of discussion {{in the field of}} Pagan studies. The majority of academics and independent scholars use the first, more inclusive definition. Given its historical status and prevalent usage within Paganism, Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White thought it the logical and easier choice for academia, although there is still some disagreement and confusion among researchers as to what defines Wicca. Among those who have used the former definition are American sociologist Margot Adler, literary scholar Chas S. Clifton, and religious studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly, while others such as the Britons Graham Harvey and Ronald Hutton failed to make their usage clear. To deal with this problem in future, Doyle White urged scholars to specify which definition they used in their work.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Borders Railway {{to describe the}} reopened line was in a paper by the Corus Rail Consultancy in January 2004, entitled Delivering an innovative Borders Railway, which had been commissioned by the Waverley Route Trust. Previously, the Edinburgh–Tweedbank line had been variously described as the Waverley Railway and the Borders Rail Link. In mid-2014, Transport Scotland considered launching a competition {{for the public to}} submit their ideas for a name but the Scottish Borders Council was strongly opposed on the basis that Borders Railway had developed a strong brand identity. The use of Waverley Line or Waverley Route for the line was considered historically inaccurate by the Council and the Campaign for Borders Rail since these names were only ever used for the whole of the original line as far as Carlisle.|$|E

5|$|The {{inclusive}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Wicca—referring to {{the entirety}} of Pagan Witchcraft religion—has been traced to Britain in the early 1960s, when it was used by various groups and publicised through use in adverts, magazines, and other literary sources. It was later adopted by figures like Alex Sanders and Gavin and Yvonne Frost, who {{took it to the}} United States. There, practitioners of British Traditional Wicca adopted it exclusively for themselves as a means to differentiate their practices from those of other Pagan Witches. This exclusive meaning was countered by its popularisation as a generic term by prolific authors such as Raymond Buckland, Scott Cunningham and Silver RavenWolf. As it entered popular culture, it gained an increasingly eclectic character in its usage. During the 1990s, some attempted to distance themselves from it by utilising the term Traditional Witchcraft.|$|E
5|$|The main militant African {{nationalist}} {{parties in}} each territory were {{banned by the}} federal and territorial governments, but all reorganised under new names only months later. The Southern Rhodesian ANC became the National Democratic Party (later ZAPU), the Northern Rhodesian ANC became the Zambian African National Congress, and the Nyasaland ANC became the Malawi Congress Party. The media's <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> 'police state' to describe {{the response to the}} violence outraged the Liberals, the Church of Scotland, and leftist Conservatives, and particularly the Labour Party, in Britain. John Stonehouse, a Labour MP, had been deported prior to the declaration of the state of emergency, adding to the tension. A Royal Commission was announced to investigate the violence. Welensky was indignant when asked to contribute to the Royal Commission, and the Labour Party boycotted it.|$|E
5|$|The rank of {{midshipman}} originated {{during the}} Tudor and Stuart eras, and originally {{referred to a}} post for an experienced seaman promoted from the ordinary deck hands, who worked in between the main and mizzen masts and had more responsibility than an ordinary seaman, but was not a military officer or an officer in training. The first published <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> midshipman was in 1662. The word derives from an area aboard a ship, amidships, but it refers either to the location where midshipmen worked on the ship, or the location where midshipmen were berthed.|$|E
25|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM) studies (e.g.) suggest that endophragm and periphragm are not morphologically separable. Therefore <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> pedium and luxuria are suggested instead.|$|R

5|$|The region, {{as defined}} above, has a total {{population}} of about 5 million. The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups. The ethnic Macedonian population of the Republic of Macedonia self-identify as Macedonian {{on a national level}}, while the Greek Macedonians self-identify as both Macedonian on a regional, and Greek on a national level. According to the Greek arguments, the ancient Macedonians' nationality was Greek and thus, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> on a national level lays claims to their history. This disambiguation problem has led {{to a wide variety of}} terms used to refer to the separate groups, more information of which can be found in the terminology by group section.|$|E
5|$|The term Rosetta stone {{has been}} used idiomatically to {{represent}} a crucial key {{in the process of}} decryption of encoded information, especially when a small but representative sample is recognised as the clue to understanding a larger whole. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first figurative <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> appeared in the 1902 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica relating to an entry on the chemical analysis of glucose. Another use of the phrase is found in H. G. Wells' 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come, where the protagonist finds a manuscript written in shorthand that provides a key to understanding additional scattered material that is sketched out in both longhand and on typewriter.|$|E
5|$|On the battlefield, the king's commanders led the troops. The empire's war {{strategy}} rarely involved massive invasions; {{more often}} it employed small scale {{methods such as}} attacking and destroying individual forts. The empire {{was among the first}} in India to use long range artillery commonly manned by foreign gunners (those from present day Turkmenistan were considered the best). Army troops were of two types: The king's personal army directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army under each feudatory. King Krishnadevaraya's personal army consisted of 100,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalrymen and over 900 elephants. This number was only a part of the army numbering over 1.1 million soldiers, a figure that varied as an army of two million has also been recorded along with the existence of a navy as evidenced by the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Navigadaprabhu (commander of the navy). The army recruited from all classes of society (supported by the collection of additional feudal tributes from feudatory rulers), and consisted of archers and musketeers wearing quilted tunics, shieldmen with swords and poignards in their girdles, and soldiers carrying shields so large that no armour was necessary. The horses and elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their tusks to do maximum damage in battle.|$|E
2500|$|There is, however, {{considerable}} {{variability in}} <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms,</b> to <b>the</b> {{extent that they}} are often used with the meanings reversed. [...] Here are some definitions of French spacing: ...|$|R
