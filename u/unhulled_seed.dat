40|$|Agronomic {{evaluation}} {{for three}} Egusi species (Cucurbitaceae) used as food in Benin and model analysis for yield prediction. Six varieties of Egusi from three species of cucurbit were evaluated for {{the fruit and}} the seed yield at the Agricultural Research Centre of Niaouli (South-Benin). Using randomised blocs, the agronomic characters such as the germination percentage, the fl owering date, the number of fruit per plant, the average fruit weight, the weight of 1, 000 <b>unhulled</b> <b>seed,</b> the weight of 1, 000 hulled seed, the ratio kernel/seed, the fruit yield, the <b>unhulled</b> <b>seed</b> yield and the hulled seed yield (kg. ha- 1) were measured. Out of the six varieties, Aklamkpa (Lagenaria siceraria) showed the highest yield for dehulled and <b>unhulled</b> <b>seed.</b> It is followed by Kilonon and Kakoun (Citrullus lanatus) which yielded more than 200 kg. ha- 1. In contrary Zohan (Cucumeropsis edulis), well appreciated by consumers for its organoleptic qualities, appeared to have the lowest yield {{in addition to the}} fact that it is a late variety. The prediction model analysis indicated that the number of fruits per plant and the average fruit weight are good estimators of the unhulled and hulled seed yield and could effectively contribute to the increase of seed yield in egusi crops...|$|E
40|$|Optimal {{foraging}} theory {{predicts that}} a foraging organism will maximize its fitness by maximizing its net energy intake per unit time, and will usually choose the available food type that yields the most calories {{for the effort}} it takes to locate, catch, or consume it. In {{an environment in which}} food is distributed in patches across different habitat types, foragers must decide which patch to visit and how long to forage there. These decisions can become complicated when competing foragers or predators are present. In this study, I compared the duration of visits of four species of overwintering passerines between bird feeders containing hulled and <b>unhulled</b> sunflower <b>seeds,</b> and also between feeders set up under forest cover and in an open field. Birds spent more time at feeders containing hulled sunflower seeds, which had a lower handling time, than at feeders containing <b>unhulled</b> <b>seeds.</b> They spent no more time at feeders in the forest than at feeders in the open, but did show a larger marginal preference for hulled seeds in the open habitat...|$|R
50|$|As an {{ingredient}} in mole dishes, {{they are known}} in Spanish as pipián. A Mexican snack using pepitas in an artisan fashion {{is referred to as}} pepitoría. Lightly roasted, salted, <b>unhulled</b> pumpkin <b>seeds</b> are popular in Greece with the descriptive Italian name, passatempo ("pastime").|$|R
5000|$|Gomashio (hiragana: also spelled gomasio) is a dry condiment, {{similar to}} furikake, made from <b>unhulled</b> sesame <b>seeds</b> (ごま, goma) and salt ( [...] , shio). It {{is often used}} in Japanese cuisine, such as a topping for sekihan. It is also {{sometimes}} sprinkled over plain rice or onigiri. Some commercially sold gomashio also has sugar {{mixed in with the}} salt.|$|R
5000|$|Pumpkin seed, {{also known}} as pepita (from the Mexican pepita de calabaza, [...] "little seed of squash"), are the edible seeds of a pumpkin or certain other cultivars of squash. The seeds are {{typically}} rather flat and asymmetrically oval, and light green in color and may have a white outer hull. Some cultivars are hulless, and are grown only for their seed. The seeds are nutrient-rich, with especially high content of protein, dietary fiber and numerous micronutrients. The word can refer either to the hulled kernel or <b>unhulled</b> whole <b>seed,</b> and most commonly refers to the roasted end product.|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{scarification}} {{greatly improved}} the germination of Lehmann Lovegrass seed. Depending {{on the type}} and duration of scarification, seed gemzination can be improved from 10 %- 12 % germination (untreated seed) to over 90 % (60 -second scarification in a commercial seed scarifier). Black grama is sensitive to both dehulling and dehulling followed by scarification. <b>Unhulled</b> black grama <b>seed</b> {{should be used for}} field plantings...|$|R
