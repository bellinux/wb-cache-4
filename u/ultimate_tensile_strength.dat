In addition, remains of other {{indeterminate}} and dubious centrosaurines, including Brachyceratops, are {{known from the}} formation and though they may represent younger stages of the three valid genera, this {{is not possible to}} demonstrate. Whereas Horner assumed that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were separate in time, in 2010 Donald M. Henderson considered it possible that at least their descendants or ancestors were overlapping or sympatric and thus would have competed for food sources unless there had been niche partitioning. The skull of Achelousaurus was more than twice as strong than that of Einiosaurus in its bending strength and torsion resistance. This might have indicated a difference in diet to avoid competition. The bite strength of Achelousaurus, measured as an <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> was 30.5newtonsper squaremeter (N/m²) at the maxillary tooth row and 18N/m² at the beak.|$|E

40|$|Background. Addition {{silicones}} {{are popular}} as dental impression materials {{and are used}} in bite registration procedures. Objective. This study aimed to compare the postsetting elasticities and other mechanical properties of thirteen addition silicone interocclusal recording materials. Materials and Methods. The following materials were investigated: Colorbite D, Futar D, Genie Bite, Jet Blue Bite fast, Memoreg 2, O-Bite, Occlufast Rock, Omni-Bite Plus, Regidur i, Registrado X-tra, Regofix transparent, StoneBite, and Variotime Bite. Thirty specimens of each material were tested. The elasticities and strengths of the materials were measured with a universal testing machine, and computer software {{was used to determine}} the E-moduli, <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths,</b> and <b>ultimate</b> elongations of the specimens. Results. The results were subjected to statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test (p≤ 0. 05). The statistics revealed that the mean E-modulus values varied significantly across the materials (p= 0. 000) and were highest for the StoneBite and Registrado X-tra and lowest for the Regofix transparent. The <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> were highest for the Regofix transparent and Registrado X-tra (p= 0. 000) and lowest for the Jet Blue Bite fast and Memoreg 2 (p= 0. 000). The elongation percentages at the point of breaking varied significantly across the materials (p= 0. 000); the lowest value was observed for the StoneBite, whereas the Regofix transparent nearly doubled original length. Conclusions. The authors concluded that materials with the high E-moduli and great <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> may be most useful clinically. Registrado X-tra and StoneBite best met these criteria...|$|R
25|$|A novel biodegradable, tough {{elastomer}} {{has been}} developed from poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) for use in creation of a nerve guidance conduit. PGS was originally developed for soft tissue engineering purposes to specifically mimic ECM mechanical properties. It is considered an elastomer because {{it is able to}} recover from deformation in mechanically dynamic environments and to effectively distribute stress evenly throughout regenerating tissues in the form of microstresses. PGS is synthesized by a polycondensation reaction of glycerol and sebacic acid, which can be melt processed or solvent processed into the desired shape. PGS has a Young's modulus of 0.28 MPa and an <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> greater than 0.5 MPa. Peripheral nerve has a Young's modulus of approximately 0.45 MPa, which is very close to that of PGS. Additionally, PGS experiences surface degradation, accompanied by losses in linear mass and strength during resorption. Following implantation, the degradation half-life was determined to be 21 days; complete degradation occurred at day 60. PGS experiences minimal water absorption during degradation and does not have detectable swelling; swelling can cause distortion, which narrows the tubular lumen and can impede regeneration. It is advantageous that the degradation time of PGS can be varied by changing the degree of crosslinking and the ratio of sebacic acid to glycerol. In a study by Sundback et al. (2005), implanted PGS and PLGA conduits had similar early tissue responses; however, PLGA inflammatory responses spiked later, while PGS inflammatory responses continued to decreases.|$|E

500|$|In the Lexingtons {{longitudinal}} {{strength was}} challenged further {{by the large}} amount of freeboard required at the forward section of the hull to keep the ships dry and maintain a high speed in various types of weather. Also, while the [...] of belt armor being considered was not an impressive amount in itself, the belt's running potentially along 80 percent of the waterline and covering the entire side amidships made the amount of armor protection impressive by European standards. Because of the difference in <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> between armor steel and hull steel, severe stresses on the hull were expected. These factors plus the ships' unusual length prompted Naval Constructor R. H. Robinson, who led the design group for the Lexingtons, to make careful analyses of strength, buoyancy and stresses expected in service. For instance, designers assumed customarily that a ship needed to withstand stresses caused by a wave of the ship's length with a ratio of height to length of 1:20. Robinson found a more reasonable ratio at 1:26 for the Lexingtons, which also promised considerable savings in weight.|$|E

All of the extruded alloys showed a bimodal microstructure consisting of equiaxed fine recrystallized (DRXed) grains and elongated coarse unDRXed grains. With increasing extrusion speed, the exit temperature increased due to deformation heating, resulting in a larger grain and a higher DRXed fraction. The yield and <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> and elongation at RT decreased with an increase of extrusion speed. The ZK 60 - 1 Ce alloys exhibited a finer grain size, a higher DRXed fraction, and weaker texture intensity than the ZK 60 alloys at the same extrusion speed due to the inhibition of grain growth by the pinning effect {{and the promotion of}} DRX by particle-stimulated nucleation. The yield and <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> at room and elevated temperatures were increased by the addition of Ce, while elongation was decreased due to cracking at the Mg-Zn-Ce particles. close 5...|$|R

When the Mn content changes from 0. 4 wt. % to 0. 8 wt. % in the alloys, the amount and the length of needle-like β-Al 5 (Fe,Mn) Si phase decrease and the plate-like δ-Al 4 (Fe,Mn) Si 2 phase becomes much coarser. After USV treatment, the Fe-containing compounds in the alloys are refined and exist mainly as δ-Al 4 (Fe,Mn) Si 2 particles with an average grain size of about 20 μm, and only a small amount of β-Al 5 (Fe,Mn) Si phase remains.
