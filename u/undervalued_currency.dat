International trade continued to expand during the decade as emerging economies and developing countries, in particular China and South-Asian countries, benefited low wages costs and most often <b>undervalued</b> <b>currencies.</b> However, global negotiations to reduce tariffs did not make any progress, as member countries of the World Trade Organization {{did not succeed in}} finding agreements to stretch the extent of free trade.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1997 / 1998 crisis, Asian economies have built up large holdings of international reserves. Although initially encouraged to do so by the IMF, more recently they have been criticised for maintaining <b>undervalued</b> <b>currencies,</b> running large current account balance of payments surpluses and accumulating excessive reserves, policies that have been blamed in part for causing global economic imbalances. This paper examines two related issues. The first is the role of closer international macroeconomic policy co-ordination in rectifying the imbalances and the institutional mechanisms through which this may be achieved. The second is the alternative ways in which the liquidity needs of Asian economies may be met without them having to acquire large reserve holdings. There may be an inconsistency in opposing reserve accumulation in Asia {{and at the same time}} blocking reform that would provide additional security against subsequent economic and financial crises. ...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "fear of floating" [...] {{has been}} mainly used to {{describe}} intervention in foreign exchange market to avoid sudden or large depreciation. However, in some cases, intervention has also been aimed at avoiding quick appreciations of domestic currency.

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{analysis in}} the paper suggests that an FX policy objective and concerns about an overheating of the domestic economy have been the two main motives for the (re-) introduction and persistence of capital controls over the past decade. Capital controls are strongly associated with countries having significantly <b>undervalued</b> <b>currencies.</b> Capital controls also appear to be less motivated by worries about financial market volatility or fickle capital flows per se, but rather by concerns about capital inflows triggering an {{overheating of the economy}} – in the form of high credit growth, rising inflation and increased output volatility. Moreover, countries {{with a high level of}} capital controls, and those actively implementing controls, tend to be those that have fixed exchange rate regimes, a non-IT monetary policy framework and shallow financial markets. This evidence is consistent with capital controls being used, at least in part, to compensate for the absence of autonomous macroeconomic and prudential policies and effective adjustment mechanisms for dealing with capital flows. ...|$|R
50|$|Yet capital {{controls}} may have externalities: some empirical studies find that capital flows were diverted {{to other countries}} as {{capital controls}} were tightened in Brazil. An IMF staff discussion (Jonathan D. Ostry et al., 2012) note explores the multilateral consequences of capital controls, and the desirability of international cooperation to achieve globally efficient outcomes. It flags three issues of potential concern. First {{is the possibility that}} capital controls may be used as a substitute for warranted external adjustment (for example, when inflow controls are used to sustain an <b>undervalued</b> <b>currency).</b> Second, the imposition of capital controls by one country may deflect some capital towards other recipient countries, exacerbating their inflow problem. Third, policies in source countries (including monetary policy) may exacerbate problems faced by capital-receiving countries if they increase the volume or riskiness of capital flows. The paper argues however that if capital controls are justified from a national standpoint (in terms of reducing domestic distortions), then under a range of circumstances they should be pursued even if they give rise to cross-border spillovers. But if policies in one country exacerbate existing distortions in other countries, and it is costly for other countries to respond, then multilateral coordination of unilateral policies is likely to be beneficial. Coordination may require borrowers to reduce inflow controls or an agreement with lenders to partially internalize the risks from excessively large or risky outflows.|$|E
5000|$|Under the Act, {{the federal}} {{government}} purchased millions of ounces of silver, with issues of paper currency. It became the second-largest buyer in the world, after the British Crown in India, where the Indian rupee was backed by silver rather than gold. In addition to the $2 million to $4 million that had been required by the Bland-Allison Act of 1878, the US government was now required to purchase an additional 4.5 million ounces of silver bullion every month. [...] The law required the Treasury to buy the silver with a special issue of Treasury (Coin) Notes that could be redeemed for either silver or gold. Gresham's law then took over. The artificially overvalued currency (silver) drove the artificially <b>undervalued</b> <b>currency</b> (gold) out of circulation. In the metals markets, silver was worth less than the government's legal exchange rate for silver vs. gold. So, investors bought silver, exchanged it at the Treasury for gold dollars, and then sold these gold dollars in the metals market for more than they had paid for the silver. They took the profits on this transaction and bought more silver. They did this over and over. This would continue until the Treasury ran out of gold. After the Panic of 1893 broke, President Grover Cleveland oversaw {{the repeal of the}} act to prevent the depletion of the government's gold reserves.|$|E
50|$|A nation’s {{current account}} balance is {{influenced}} by numerous factors - its trade policies, exchange rate, competitiveness, forex reserves, inflation rate and others.Since the trade balance (exports minus imports) is generally the biggest determinant of the current account surplus or deficit, the current account balance often displays a cyclical trend. During a strong economic expansion, import volumes typically surge; if exports are unable to grow at the same rate, the current account deficit will widen. Conversely, during a recession, the current account deficit will shrink if imports decline and exports increase to stronger economies.The currency exchange rate exerts a significant influence on the trade balance, and by extension, on the current account. An overvalued currency makes imports cheaper and exports less competitive, thereby widening the current account deficit (or narrowing the surplus). An <b>undervalued</b> <b>currency,</b> on the other hand, boosts exports and makes imports more expensive, thus increasing the current account surplus (or narrowing the deficit).Nations with chronic current account deficits often come under increased investor scrutiny during periods of heightened uncertainty. The currencies of such nations often come under speculative attack during such times. This creates a vicious circle where precious foreign exchange reserves are depleted to support the domestic currency, and this forex reserve depletion - combined with a deteriorating trade balance - puts further pressure on the currency. Embattled nations are often forced to take stringent measures to support the currency, such as raising interest rates and curbing currency outflows.|$|E

40|$|China’s {{policy of}} a weak reminbi has reignited an old debate in {{development}} economics: whether undervalued exchange rates are useful policy tools to accelerate growth. A {{growing body of}} literature, in recent years, has suggested this {{is in fact the}} case. This paper explores the relevance of possible explanations for the effect by means of a simple exercise: we estimate the impact of an <b>undervalued</b> <b>currency</b> on the different components of GDP. We find that, for developing countries, undervaluation does not seem to affect the tradable sector (the export promotion and import substitution channels) but instead leads to greater domestic savings and investment, as well as employment. A possible interpretation of these results is Diaz Alejandro´s (1965) thesis that an undervalued exchange rate transfers resources from low- to high-income agents with a higher propensity to save: to the extent that these resources are saved and invested at home(rather than abroad as envisioned by Díaz Alejandro), the redistributive effects of an <b>undervalued</b> <b>currency</b> should be growth enhancing. ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the latter}} half of 1998, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, former {{chairwoman}} of the President's Council of Economic Advisers and economics professor at Berkeley, wrote a highly-publicized commentary that questioned whether China would replace Japan as the antagonist in America’s trade deficit woes. 1 She stated "As the U.

40|$|The Asian {{financial}} crisis has generated {{a lot of}} research, analysis and debate. The exact causes of the crisis are not firmly established, although various hypotheses have been offered.

In addition, the paper offers an additional contributory cause of the crisis- China’s mercantilist policy. The role of the international system in allowing China to devalue its currency (by over 50 percent), despite burgeoning trade surpluses, is also addressed.

Accordingly, the recently requested revaluation of the Chinese yuan may not be an effective policy for reducing the Chinese current account surplus, and may affect other Asian current accounts. We also investigate whether a Chinese currency revaluation would contribute to the improvement of current account imbalances in East Asia and find that a revaluation would improve the current accounts of Japan, Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand. Since the trade structures of major East Asian countries are substitutes with that of China, a Chinese currency revaluation might not lead to a decrease, rather that an increase, in East Asian current account surpluses.

An improvement in a country’s energy efficiency is measured as {{a reduction in}} energy intensity, while holding constant that economy’s mix of inputs and outputs.
