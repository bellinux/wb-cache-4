2500|$|Abbott was incarcerated at San Quentin {{to await}} execution. His lawyers worked to commute his {{sentence}} {{for over a}} year.

Knight, but the governor was at sea on a naval ship and out of reach of the telephone. The attorney [...] arranged with a TV station to broadcast a plea to the governor. [...] At 9:02 Governor Knight granted one hour's stay by telephone. Within six minutes [...] a writ of habeas corpus was presented [...] to the Supreme Court of California but at 10:42 am the petition was denied.

2500|$|Tismăneanu {{has been}} accused by {{multiple}} Romanian and foreign scholars and researchers of employing dubious methods to squelch criticism {{of him and his}} works. [...] In May 2012, the well-respected scholar Alina Mungiu-Pippidi wrote, [...] "I hope that Volodea will once again become the spiritual creature, subtle and {{with a sense of humor}} who he used to be, and that we can forget this sinister alter-ego that he has become, telephoning newspapers and television stations to orchestrate--without being asked by anybody--pro-Băsescu propaganda and putting pressure on independent journalists." [...] According to Michael Shafir, Tismăneanu responded to criticisms by the American researcher Richard Hall as follows: [...] "On the one hand, the vicepresident of the Civic Alliance, Sorin Ilieşiu, a person close to Tismăneanu, reacted by putting the word [...] "analyst" [...] in quotes, so that the journalist Andrei Bădin could then [...] "demonstrate" [...] that Hall wasn't a CIA analyst, but had only served an insignificant [...] "probationary" [...] period of six months. [...] The person who was the object of his criticism knew better: [...] Hall had published in the very journal that he had previously led ("East European Politics and Societies"). [...] So he picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> and yelled at Richard Hall's supervisor, in a scene that could have been included in [...] "Stalinism for All Seasons." [...] Michael Shafir detailed Tismăneanu's tactics more broadly in an article entitled suggestively, [...] "About Questionable Clarifications, Plagiarism, Being an Imposter, and Careerism." [...] In November 2013, Vasile Ernu told an interviewer how Editura Curtea Veche cancelled a book contract because among a handful of references to Tismăneanu one suggested that [...] "Tismăneanu employs two different discourses, one inside Romania and one outside." ...|$|E
