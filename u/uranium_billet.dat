40|$|Under {{the auspices}} of an {{agreement}} between the U. S. and the United Kingdom, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{has an opportunity to}} transfer approximately 710, 000 kilograms (1, 562, 000 pounds) of unneeded normal and low-enriched uranium (LEU) to the United Kingdom; thus, reducing long-term surveillance and maintenance burdens at the Hanford Site. The material, in the form of billets, is controlled by DOE`s Defense Programs, and is presently stored as surplus material in the 300 Area of the Hanford Site. The United Kingdom has expressed a need for the billets. The surplus uranium billets are currently stored in wooden shipping containers in secured facilities in the 300 Area at the Hanford Site (the 303 -B and 303 -G storage facilities). There are 482 billets at an enrichment level (based on uranium- 235 content) of 0. 71 weight-percent. This enrichment level is normal uranium; that is, uranium having 0. 711 as the percentage by weight of uranium- 235 as occurring in nature. There are 3, 242 billets at an enrichment level of 0. 95 weight-percent (i. e., low-enriched uranium). This inventory represents a total of approximately 532 curies. The facilities are routinely monitored. The dose rate on contact of a <b>uranium</b> <b>billet</b> is approximately 8 millirem per hour. The dose rate on contact of a wooden shipping container containing 4 billets is approximately 4 millirem per hour. The dose rate at the exterior of the storage facilities is indistinguishable from background levels...|$|E
500|$|Some [...] of {{graphite}} blocks {{were purchased}} from National Carbon. The construction crews began stacking them in September 1943. Cast <b>uranium</b> <b>billets</b> came from Metal Hydrides, Mallinckrodt and other suppliers. These were extruded into cylindrical slugs, and then canned. The fuel slugs were canned {{to protect the}} uranium metal from corrosion that would occur if it {{came into contact with}} water, and to prevent the venting of gaseous radioactive fission products that might be formed when they were irradiated. Aluminum was chosen as it transmitted heat but did not absorb too many neutrons. Alcoa started canning on June 14, 1943. General Electric and the Metallurgical Laboratory developed a new welding technique to seal the cans airtight, and the equipment for this was installed in the production line at Alcoa in October 1943.|$|R

40|$|Under proper {{conditions}} of vacuum and mold preheat, a sound ductile alloy bond {{can be achieved}} by casting molten uranium into zirconium and Zircaloy- 2 molds. Investigations indicate that a process for production of zirconium of Zircaloy- 2 clad fuel elements can be developed by casting directly into preformed shells. Employment of cast bonding techniques appears to be a simple and practical method for assembling extrusion billets. It also appears that coextrusion of cast bonded normal <b>uranium</b> <b>billets</b> produces a clad rod exhibiting a rather uniform cladding thickness and map permit greater freedom in selection of extrusion conditions to produce a clad and bonded geometry. Forming of cast bond ingots in diamond-round or oval-round sequences falled to produce a clad rod with uniform jacket thickness. subsequent forming operations failed to rectify nonuniformities in jacket thicknesses once they had occurred.

40|$|In the mid- 1940 s, B and T Metals, 425 West Town Street, Columbus, Ohio {{became one}} of the first {{commercial}} firms to provide extrusion of <b>uranium</b> <b>billets</b> into rods in support of Manhattan Engineer District (MED) operations. The US Department of Energy conducted radiological surveys of these sites to evaluate current radiological conditions as part of the 1974 Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). In 1988 and 1989, a preliminary radiological survey was conducted by ORNL on the commercial property of B and T Metals. Results of the survey indicated that limited and localized residual radioactive material found in the main building and in one area outdoors exceeded current DOE guidelines, and the site was recommended for remediation. In the spring of 1996, a radiological verification survey of this property was conducted by ORNL, the independent verification contractor, in conjunction with decontamination operations conducted under the supervision of Bechtel National, Incorporated. The verification survey included gamma scans of the main building and parts of the grounds, limited beta-gamma scans of the building and roof, limited alpha scans of inside overhead structures, smear sampling, and the collection of samples for radionuclide analysis. This report describes the results of the radiological verification survey of the commercial property of B and T Metals, Columbus, Ohio...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{experiment}} was to extrude normal <b>uranium</b> hollow <b>billets</b> to I and E `O` size tubing with reduced extruded O. D. {{and also to}} evaluate the use of pressed salt follower blocks. Pressed salt (NaCl) follower blocks under various conditions of pre-heat temperature were compared with the standard graphite at 800 F. Even though some yield reduction results, it was concluded that pressed salt follower blocks at 300 F represent a substantial cost reduction due to the extreme price differential of the two perishable items. Extruded O. D. `s of. 020 inch and. 040 inch less than the standard (nominal) 1. 50 inch represent no gain in yield due to the sharp increase in machined slug rejects for O. D. defects...|$|R
