5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, {{the houses were}} built in pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour. For many of the smaller fourth- and fifth-class houses, the doors were aligned {{at right angles to}} the façade of the house, so as not to open {{directly}} adjacently to their neighbours. All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets <b>upstairs.</b> <b>In</b> line with the design principles of the time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and the houses were not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths were taken in a moveable bath located in the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Smith {{appeared}} as Henry in the Polly Stenham play That Face at the Royal Court Theatre <b>Upstairs</b> <b>in</b> Chelsea. The play {{transferred to the}} Duke of York's Theatre in the West End in 2008 and became Smith's second role there. That Face focuses primarily upon alcohol and drug addiction in an upper-middle-class family after the paternal figure in the family leaves. As Henry, Smith portrayed an aspiring artist who left school {{to take care of}} his mother. To prepare for the role, the cast interviewed alcoholics and their families. Smith discussed his character's relationship with his mother in a May 2008 interview with the Evening Standard.|$|E

A mixing console previously owned by Elektra was installed <b>upstairs</b> <b>in</b> the Workshop, while studio monitors, microphones, and keyboards were set up downstairs.

Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry and laugh at the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her <b>upstairs.</b> <b>In</b> the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E

Kung Fu follows Gorgeous as {{she leaves the}} room, only to find Sweet's body trapped in a {{grandfather}} clock. Panic-driven, the remaining girls barricade {{the upper part of}} the house while Prof, Fantasy and Kung Fu read the aunt's diary. They are interrupted by the giant-sized head of Gorgeous. Gorgeous reveals that her aunt died many years ago waiting for her fiancée to return from World War II and that her spirit remains, eating unmarried girls who arrive at her home. The three girls are then attacked by household items. Prof shouts to Kung Fu to attack the aunt's cat, Blanche. As Kung Fu lunges into a flying kick, she is eaten by a possessed light fixture. Kung Fu's legs manage to escape and attack the painting of Blanche on the wall. The attacked Blanche portrait spurts blood, causing the room to flood. Prof tries to read the diary to solve the problem, but is pulled under the blood by a monster jar. Fantasy sees Gorgeous in the bridal gown and paddles towards her. Gorgeous appears as her aunt in the reflection in the blood and then cradles Fantasy. In the morning, Ryoko arrives at the house and finds Gorgeous in a classic kimono. Gorgeous tells Ryoko that her friends will wake up soon and that they will be hungry. She then shakes hands with Ryoko and burns her away to nothing.|$|E

25|$|Behind {{the wall}} of the old Vaults (see section 4.3 above), set back from the street, are two well known Leith restaurants. Aside from their reputations for good food, both have capitalised on their unique {{historic}} location. Anfora Wine Bar (v) has its dining room within a space originally designed for claret tasting and still lit by candlelight and decorated with fine plasterwork. <b>Upstairs,</b> <b>in</b> the same building, The Scotch Malt Whisky Society (iv) has its restaurant.

25|$|The storyline {{takes place}} at the Kappa Alpha Delta fraternity. Marty is the 18-year-old party girl, while Todd is the 20-year-old quintessential jock. She is his tutor, but he does not pass one of his exams. Because of this, he is kicked off the {{football}} team and will not graduate on time. Additionally, his abusive father will be outraged. Angered by this outcome, Todd initially decides to humiliate Marty at a party (the Spring Fling). She is the one to humiliate him, however, and even notes his inability to satisfy her in bed. As revenge, Todd has his fraternity brothers Powell Lord (the III) and Zach Rosen help him rape her after she is left alone <b>upstairs</b> <b>in</b> Kevin's room.|$|E

25|$|At the Walford In Bloom competition, {{there is}} a gas {{explosion}} and Martin is panicked when he cannot find Stacey and hits a police officer, resulting in two weeks imprisonment. When Kush suffers a cardiac arrest, he is diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome, which is hereditary. Stacey worries that Arthur could die and tells Bex {{about the possibility of}} Arthur having the syndrome. A doctor assures Stacey that the chance of Arthur displaying symptoms at a young age is small. After Stacey misses Lily's dance show, she tells Lily about Arthur's condition. Stacey is annoyed with Whitney when she takes Lily and Arthur for breakfast and Lily is fed up of being ignored by an exhausted Stacey. When Lily refuses to eat her tea, Stacey physically takes Lily to go <b>upstairs</b> <b>in</b> the presence of Carmel, who refuses to leave Stacey with Lily and Arthur. Arthur undergoes an ECG and Stacey, Kush and Martin are told by the specialist that Arthur is at high risk at having the condition, but cannot have an operation or tests like Kush due to his age. Stacey is anxious that Arthur having a cardiac arrest is a sign of the condition and his parents are told about equipment that is not available on the NHS. Stacey is angry with Martin that he asked Kush for money to buy the equipment. Stacey and Martin panic when Arthur will not wake up, and when they receive Arthur's medical records at the hospital, Stacey and Martin are told that Arthur has swallowed Stacey's bipolar medication. Carmel is horrified when she finds bruises on Arthur's arms, and expresses her concerns to Kush that Stacey is unwell, while Stacey tells her sister-in-law Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell) that he gained the bruises in hospital. However, Lily tells Carmel that Stacey was responsible, so Carmel reports it to social services, but tries to retract what she said after realising it was a mistake. Social services visit Stacey and Martin and tell them they received a report about Arthur. Arthur and Lily are placed in Carmel's care until social services have investigated. Arthur is looked over by a doctor, who has no concerns and Stacey and Martin can have Arthur and Lily back. Social worker Fiona Payne (Sandra James-Young) tells Stacey and Martin she will be conducting further home visits. Lily tells Stacey and Martin that she injured Arthur. After speaking with Lily, Fiona tells Stacey and Martin that Lily feels pushed out with Arthur and is anxious about the new baby. Kush and Carmel admit Carmel called social services, enraging Stacey, who bans them both from seeing Arthur before suffering an eclamptic seizure. She is taken to hospital, where her and Martin are told her baby will have to be delivered prematurely {{due to a lack of}} oxygen. The baby is delivered, though Martin is told that there are complications. Stacey goes to see her daughter, but changes her mind and snaps at Martin for allowing Carmel to look after Lily. Stacey later sees her daughter. Stacey and Martin's daughter is put on a ventilator. Stacey grows annoyed at Martin suggesting baby names, but confides in Max about her feelings. Stacey apologises to Martin and they name their daughter Hope.|$|E
