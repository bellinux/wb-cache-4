Since the mid- 1940 s, exiles and dictators had denounced the Guatemalan Revolution {{as the product of}} Mexican, Soviet, and international communism. The anti-communist ideology of Guatemalan exiles, Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, Honduran dictator Tiburcio Carías, and Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo facilitated various conspiracies aimed to destabilize Arévalo and Arbenz’s governments throughout the 1940 s. For their own reasons, a network of exiles and dictators put into motion a counter-revolution that included subversive ventures and self-proclaimed anti-communists who became patrons for colonel Carlos Castillo Armas in the early 1950 s. In 1952, it was this network’s intelligence-sharing and lobbying of <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>officials</b> that built the foundation of Operation PBFORTUNE.

Like these earlier studies, we also find that economic performance had a smaller antipoverty effect during the 1970 s and 1980 s than it did in earlier years.

Numerous commentators, asserting that many of these activities violate <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> law, have called on the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> government to cease such operations and prosecute <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>officials</b> who engage in them. Nonetheless, President Barack Obama established a Special Task Force, which recently advocated the continued use of rendition operations, though it suggested some policy changes.

40|$|This dissertation’s {{approach}} {{starts from}} four basic premises.

The second premise is that, {{in order for the}} Western state to periodically pursue objectives that partially conflict with its professed principles, the state will present such objectives as liberal by understating the illiberal characteristics of foreign allies and overstating the undemocratic characteristics of rivals. The third premise is that, given the cultural authority of the state, its positions and narratives will have some distorting effects upon how the nation’s news organizations depict the political life of countries governed by allies and rivals. The last premise is that such distorted media depictions will often make it difficult for citizens and elites to detect when and where the Western power is casually deviating from its professed liberalism in its external relations.
