5|$|Pioneer Entertainment {{released}} the dubbed Cardcaptors episodes to nine VHS and DVD compilation volumes from November 2000 to July 2002. They also {{released the}} <b>unedited</b> Cardcaptor Sakura {{series with the}} original Japanese audio tracks and English subtitles, to 18 DVDs from November 2000 to November 2003; the first 11 volumes were also released in VHS. The Cardcaptor Sakura TV series DVDs went out-of-print {{at the end of}} 2006 when the license expired.

5|$|A {{new edition}} was planned {{beginning}} in 1914 by Walther von Dyck (1856–1934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's <b>unedited</b> manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts {{to convince the}} Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction. These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler {{that had not been}} available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the episode}} has aired in Australia (although {{initially}} {{in a later}} than normal time), New Zealand, Europe, and Canada <b>unedited,</b> the above omissions mean that the show has never been broadcast in the United States in its entirety. The total time between when the episode was taped and when it premiered in the United States was 13 years, 5 months, and 12 days.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 Major-General Giora Eiland {{publicly}} retracted the IDF's {{admission of}} responsibility, and {{a statement to}} that effect {{was approved by the}} prime minister's office in September 2007. The following year an IDF spokesman, Col. Shlomi Am-Shalom, said that the Shahaf report had shown the IDF could not have shot Muhammad. He asked France2 to send the IDF the <b>unedited</b> 27minutes of raw footage, as well as footage the France2 cameraman shot the following day.|$|E
5|$|On 18 October 2003, Cindy and Donald Hewitt, the scriptwriters of Walt Disney Pictures' English dubs of Spirited Away and Porco Rosso, {{announced}} that an <b>unedited</b> and redubbed version of Nausicaä was in pre-production, and that Patrick Stewart and Uma Thurman had been cast. Natalie Portman was {{originally intended to}} voice Nausicaä, but Alison Lohman was eventually assigned the role.|$|E
5|$|The {{aim of the}} {{publishing}} house was to publish the works of former Waffen-SS members, in cooperation with HIAG. The authors of {{the publishing}} house were former Waffen-SS unit commanders or staff officers, {{who were members of}} HIAG. The Munin Verlag titles did not go through the rigorous fact-checking processes common in the traditional historical literature; they were revisionist accounts <b>unedited</b> by professional historians and presented the former Waffen-SS members' version of events.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo's digital Virtual Console {{platform}} {{brought the}} <b>unedited</b> 1986 Japanese release to North America {{for the first}} time. The Lost Levels was released for Nintendo's Wii Virtual Console digital platform in 2007 (partially in support of Nintendo's Hanabi Festival), and the 3DS version followed in 2012. The Wii U Virtual Console release came to Japan in 2013, and to Europe and North America the next year. The Lost Levels were also included in Nintendo classic game compilations including the 2014 NES Remix 2 (Wii U) and Ultimate NES Remix (3DS).|$|E
5|$|The BBC made Quatermass and the Pit {{available}} to buy on VHS videotape in 1988, edited into a two-part compilation format. This {{was a new}} compilation made from the episodic film recordings, which had optical sound and telecined film inserts. This was re-released on VHS by Paradox Films, Total Home Entertainment and Revelation Films in 1995, and subsequently on DVD by Revelation Films in 2000. The full, <b>unedited,</b> episodic version of the serial was released on DVD by BBC Worldwide in 2005, as part of The Quatermass Collection box set. Also included were the surviving two episodes of The Quatermass Experiment, all of Quatermass II and various extra features.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{version of}} Grand Theft Auto IV {{released}} in Australia and New Zealand was pre-censored by Rockstar {{to allow the}} game to meet the perceived requirements of the Australian classification system. However, the game was resubmitted to the New Zealand OFLC by Stan Calif, a 21-year-old student who was unhappy that New Zealand received an edited version of the game {{as a result of}} Australian censorship laws. The <b>unedited</b> version was subsequently given an R18 rating and cleared for sale in New Zealand. For the PC release, the uncensored version of the game was awarded MA15+ in Australia. Following the release of The Lost and Damned, Rockstar distributed a patch which uncensored the Australian console version.|$|E
5|$|The series began {{broadcasting}} on 11 October 2004 on BBC One {{during the}} 9 to 10pm timeslot, {{and continued on}} every Monday night until 13 December 2004. The second to ninth episodes were pre-empted on Saturday nights, starting 16 October 2004, on digital channel BBC Three. In the United States the series began broadcast on the A Network, where it is known as MI-5, {{from the start of}} 2005. However, because each episode last approximately an hour, 15 minutes had to be edited out on each to accommodate for advert breaks. However, the DVD release of the series in the United States included the episodes <b>unedited.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 65 ABC affiliates—28% of the network—did not clear the {{available}} timeslot for the film, {{even with the}} offer of The Walt Disney Company, ABC's parent, to pay all fines for language to the Federal Communications Commission. In the end, however, no complaints were lodged against ABC affiliates who showed Ryan, perhaps because even conservative watchdogs like the Parents Television Council supported the <b>unedited</b> rebroadcast of the film. Additionally, some ABC affiliates in other markets that were near affected markets, such as Youngstown, Ohio, ABC affiliate WYTV (which is viewable {{in parts of the}} Columbus, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh markets, none of which aired the film) and Gainesville, Florida, ABC affiliate WCJB-TV (which is viewable in parts of the Orlando and Tampa markets), still aired the film and gave those nearby markets the option of viewing the film. TNT and Turner Classic Movies have also broadcast the film.|$|E
5|$|In September 2002, a DVD box set of all 30 Joe 90 episodes, sourced from {{a digital}} remaster of 35mm film prints, was {{released}} in Region 2 by Carlton. The five component discs were also released individually at intervals between September 2002 and January 2003, and the episodes were also marketed in a new five-volume VHS package. A North American set from A debuted in July 2003 before a Region 4 version appeared in October. A French-language release of Joe 90– Agent Très Spécial (English: Joe 90 – Very Special Agent) hit the Canadian market in 2004. With these DVD releases, the component episodes of The Amazing Adventures of Joe 90 were made commercially available in their <b>unedited</b> form for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter, {{with help}} from his {{children}} Chris and Meg, decides to create his own animated series about a trio of handicapped ducks entitled Handi-Quacks. All of Meg's reasonable and sometimes rational suggestions are shot down by Peter and Chris in favor of their more unusual and nonsensical ideas. Peter eventually fires Meg. He and Chris then decide on a joke involving a wood stove and a house of cards, and invite Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe to voice the characters. Although {{it is suggested that}} the crudely animated and developed pilot episode will likely fail, CEO Peter Chernin enjoys it and agrees to air the show, but Peter becomes angered when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a plum instead of a tomato. Peter's passion about his work impresses Chernin into allowing him to air the episode <b>unedited,</b> but he decides not to let the episode be aired at all, which he later regrets.|$|E
5|$|Shaw was a {{prolific}} correspondent throughout his life. His letters, edited by Dan H. Laurence, were published between 1965 and 1988. Shaw once estimated his letters would occupy twenty volumes; Laurence commented that, <b>unedited,</b> they would fill many more. Shaw wrote {{more than a}} quarter of a million letters, of which about ten per cent have survived; 2,653 letters are printed in Laurence's four volumes. Among Shaw's many regular correspondents were his childhood friend Edward McNulty; his theatrical colleagues (and amitiés amoureuses) Mrs Patrick Campbell and Ellen Terry; writers including Lord Alfred Douglas, H. G. Wells and G. K. Chesterton; the boxer Gene Tunney; the nun Laurentia McLachlan; and the art expert Sydney Cockerell. In 2007 a 316-page volume consisting entirely of Shaw's letters to The Times was published.|$|E
5|$|The German {{version of}} The Testament of Dr. Mabuse premiered on April 21, 1933, in Budapest, Hungary with a playing time of 124 minutes. The French-language version was {{distributed}} through Europe. A subtitled {{version of the}} French version was released in 1943 with the title The Last Will of Dr. Mabuse in the United States. In 1951, the German version was released in a 75-minute version with the title The Crimes of Dr.Mabuse which featured an English dub. The English subtitles for the 1943 release and the 1952 dub added allusions to Adolf Hitler that {{were not part of}} the original script. The Testament of Dr. Mabuse was first shown publicly in Germany on August 24, 1961 with a 111-minute running time. In 1973, the <b>unedited</b> German version of the film was released in the United States with the title The Testament of Dr. Mabuse with English subtitles.|$|E
5|$|The second film, Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card, was {{released}} in Japan on July 15, 2000. It provided a conclusion to the TV series, in which Syaoran returns to Tokyo in hopes of getting Sakura's answer to his love confession, but her own confession is interrupted {{by the appearance of}} a 53rd Clow Card. It {{was released}} to LD (as a limited edition) and DVD in January 2001, and to VHS in July 2001. It {{was released in}} North America to DVD by Pioneer in November 2003 and featured an English dub by Bang Zoom! Entertainment instead of Nelvana and Ocean Studios, now with Kari Wahlgren as Sakura, and this time retaining the original character names and the content <b>unedited</b> and uncut. The films as released by Pioneer (later renamed Geneon) remained in print in North America until late 2007. A bonus short film titled Leave it to Kero! was played with the theatrical screening of the second film.|$|E
5|$|Madhouse {{produced}} two, 82-minute anime {{films as}} an extension to the anime television series series. The first, Cardcaptor Sakura: The Movie, was released on August 21, 1999. Set {{between the first and}} second seasons of the TV series, the film shows Sakura and her friends going to Hong Kong where they encounter a vengeful spirit who was hurt by Clow Reed in the past. It was released to VHS, LD and DVD in Japan by Bandai Visual in February 2000. Nelvana released an English dubbed version of the film, retaining the same name and story changes as its main Cardcaptors dub, although it was dubbed with no visual edits and was released in cut and uncut versions. As with the TV series, Pioneer Entertainment also released the film with the original Japanese audio and English subtitles, and also released a bilingual DVD containing both audio tracks. Both the edited and <b>unedited</b> versions were released on VHS and DVD in March 2002. Discotek Media released the first film on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on September 30, 2014 in North America.|$|E
5|$|Monroe {{finishes}} {{viewing the}} footage, and expresses his disgust {{to the station}} executives regarding their decision to air the documentary. To convince them otherwise, he shows them the remaining, <b>unedited</b> footage, which only he has seen. The final two reels begin with the team locating a Ya̧nomamö girl, whom the men film and gang-rape. Faye only tries to intervene when Alan participates. Afterwards, they encounter the same girl impaled on a wooden pole by a riverbank, where they claim that the natives killed her for loss of virginity. Shortly afterwards, they are attacked by the Ya̧nomamö in revenge for the girl's rape and death. Jack is hit by a spear, and Alan shoots him so the team can film how the natives mutilate his corpse. As the three surviving team members try to escape, Faye is captured. Alan initially insists that they try to rescue her, but ultimately decides not to. Mark continues to film as she is raped, beaten to death, and beheaded. The Ya̧nomamö then pursues and kills the last two team members as the camera drops {{to the floor and}} ends showing Alan's bloody face. Disturbed by what they have seen, the executives order the footage to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Nelvana {{licensed}} Cardcaptor Sakura in North America, {{dubbed the}} series into English with Ocean Studios featuring Carly McKillip as Sakura, and released {{it under the}} name Cardcaptors. This version was heavily edited from the original Japanese version. The initial version of the dub covered all 70 episodes, although character names were changed, some Japanese text was changed to English, and controversial subjects such as same-sex relationships were edited out. The musical score was completely replaced with new music {{and some of the}} sound effects were replaced when they could not be separated into separate tracks, although the original opening and ending themes were dubbed into English. This version aired in Australia on Network Ten and Cartoon Network, in Ireland on RTÉ2, in the UK on CiTV and Nickelodeon, and in Canada on Teletoon (which also aired the episodes with a French dub). An alternative English dub of the series was produced by Omni Productions to air on Animax Asia and it has been shown entirely <b>unedited</b> and uncut making it very faithfully closer to the original Japanese version, which it broadcast on its English-language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia.|$|E
5|$|The appeal {{began on}} 29 February 2008 in the Victorian Court of Appeal. Nine Network lawyers {{argued that the}} network {{should be allowed to}} {{broadcast}} the first three episodes of the series, arguing Justice King had erred in her decision to suppress the series because she had viewed the <b>unedited</b> version, rather than the final edited cut that was to be shown to audiences. The network believed the first three episodes, which depicted events {{from the beginning of the}} underworld war in 1995, would have no potential to prejudice any part of the trial. Goussis's murder trial was due to begin on 31 March 2008. The judges overseeing the appeal retired to decide their verdict on 3 March 2008. Their decision on 26 March 2008 upheld Justice King's ruling that the series was not to be broadcast or distributed in or out of Victoria. During the appeal the Nine Network had proposed to screen the first three episodes immediately after any successful appeal, and would give the court seven days written notice of its intention to show any further episodes that it believed would not prejudice the murder trial. The Court of Appeal had dismissed the network's application to appeal, and the network was compelled to comply with the suppression order issued by Justice King until the offending trial was complete.|$|E
5|$|The director's {{original}} cut of Sholay has {{a different}} ending in which Thakur kills Gabbar, along with some additional violent scenes. Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the imam's son is killed, were cut from the film by India's Censor Board, as was the scene in which Thakur's family is massacred. The Censor Board {{was concerned about the}} violence, and that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely. Although Sippy fought to keep the scenes, eventually he had to re-shoot the ending of the film, and as directed by the Censor Board, have the police arrive just before Thakur can kill Gabbar. The censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years. The original, <b>unedited</b> cut of the film finally came out in a British release on VHS in 1990. Since then, Eros International has released two versions on DVD. The director's cut of the film preserves the original full frame and is 204minutes in length; the censored widescreen version is 198minutes long.|$|E
5|$|The museum's Film and Video Archive {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} film {{archives}} in the world. The archive preserves a range of historically significant film and video material, including the official British film record of the First World War. Notable among the archive's First World War holdings is The Battle of the Somme, a pioneering 1916 documentary film (which was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 2005), and Der Magische Gürtel, a German 1917 propaganda film about the submarine U-35. The archive's Second World War holdings include <b>unedited</b> film shot by British military cameramen, which document combat actions such as the British landings on D-Day in June 1944, and the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945. The archive also holds government information films and propaganda features such as Target for Tonight and Desert Victory. The archive's post-Second World War collections include material from the Korean War, Cold War material, the former film library of NATO, and material produced by the United Nations UNTV service in Bosnia. As an official repository under the 1958 Public Records Act, the archive continues to receive material from the Ministry of Defence. The archive also seeks to acquire amateur film taken by both service personnel and civilian cameramen. Material from the collection was used to make a number of well-known TV documentary series including The Great War and The World at War. In 2012 the museum reported the size of its film archive as being in excess of 23,000 hours of film, video and digital footage.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the primary}} sources, i.e., those {{composed}} by the Jesuits themselves {{during the years}} 1691 through 1767, {{those that have been}} extensively researched (many as yet have not been thoroughly examined) are few. The most useful is the monumental Historia general de la Compañía de Jesús en la Provincia del Perú: Crónica anómina de 1600 que trata del establecimiento y misiones de la Compañía de Jesús en los países de habla española en la América meridional, vol. II, edited by Francisco Mateos (Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 1944). Also of importance is the <b>unedited</b> archive of correspondence from the Jesuits of Paraguay from the years 1690-1718. Collectively known as “Cartas a los Provinciales de la Provincia del Paraguay 1690-1718,” these manuscripts are housed in the Jesuit Archives of Argentina in Buenos Aires, which also contain the invaluable annals of the Paraguay Province of the Company of Jesus, covering the years 1689-1762. The German edition of Fr. Julián Knogler’s Inhalt einer Beschreibung der Missionen deren Chiquiten, Archivum Historicum Societatis Jesu, 39/78 (Rome: Company of Jesus, 1970) is indispensable, as is his account Relato sobre el país y la nación de los Chiquitos en las Indias Occidentales o América del Sud y en la misiones en su territorio, for a condensed version of which, see Werner Hoffman, Las misiones jesuíticas entre los chiquitanos (Buenos Aires: Fundación para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura, 1979). Fr. Juan de Montenegro’s Breve noticia de las missiones, peregrinaciones apostólicas, trabajos, sudor, y sangre vertida, en obsequio de la fe, de el venerable padre Augustín Castañares, de la Compañía de Jesús, insigne missionero de la provincia del Paraguay, en las missiones de Chiquitos, Zamucos, y ultimamente en la missión de los infieles Mataguayos, (Madrid: Manuel Fernández, Impresor del Supremo Consejo de la Inquisición, de la Reverenda Cámara Apostólica, y del Convento de las Señoras de la Encarnación, en la Caba Baxa, 1746) and Fr. Juan Patricio Fernández’s Relación historial de las misiones de los indios, que llaman chiquitos, que están a cargo de los padres de la Compañía de Jesús de la provincia del Paraguay (Madrid: Manuel Fernández, Impresor de Libros, 1726) are also valuable. There are other primary sources as yet unexamined, the majority of which are archived in Cochabamba, Sucre, and Tarija (in Bolivia); Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and Tucumán (in Argentina); Asunción (Paraguay); Madrid; and Rome.|$|E

25|$|After Sartre died in 1980, de Beauvoir {{published}} his letters {{to her with}} edits to spare the feelings of people in their circle who were still living. After de Beauvoir's death, Sartre's adopted daughter and literary heir Arlette Elkaïm would not let many of Sartre's letters be published in <b>unedited</b> form. Most of Sartre's letters available today have de Beauvoir's edits, which include a few omissions but mostly the use of pseudonyms. De Beauvoir's adopted daughter and literary heir Sylvie Le Bon, unlike Elkaïm, published de Beauvoir's <b>unedited</b> letters to both Sartre and Algren.|$|E
