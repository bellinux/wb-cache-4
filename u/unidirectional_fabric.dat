40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the study of}} influence of laminate sequence and fabric type on the baseline acoustic nonlinearity of fiber-reinforced composites. Nonlinearelastic wave techniques are increasingly becoming popular in detecting damage in composite materials. It was earlier observed by the authors that the non-classical nonlinear response of fiber-reinforced composite {{is influenced by the}} fiber orientation [Chakrapani, Barnard, and Dayal, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 137 (2), 617 â€“ 624 (2015) ]. The current study expands this effort to investigate the effect of laminate sequence and fabric type on the non-classical nonlinear response. Two hypotheses were developed using the previous results, and the theory of interlaminar stresses to investigate the influence of laminate sequence and fabric type. Each hypothesis was tested by capturing the nonlinear response by performing nonlinear resonance spectroscopy and measuring frequency shifts, loss factors, and higher harmonics. It was observed that the laminate sequence can either increase or decrease the nonlinear response based on the stacking sequence. Similarly, tests were performed to compare <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabric</b> and woven fabric and it was observed that woven fabric exhibited a lower nonlinearresponse compared to the <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabric.</b> Conjectures based on the matrix properties and interlaminar stresses were used in an attempt to explain the observed nonlinear responses for different configurations...|$|E

Five key methods to achieve the unidirectional water-transport effect have been reviewed, including the designing of fabric structure, chemical finishing, plasma treatment, electro spinning and photocatalytic treatment.

40|$|Advani, Suresh G. In Liquid Composite Molding (LCM) processes, {{reinforcing}} glass, carbon or Kevlar fiber preforms {{are placed}} in a mold cavity and a liquid resin is introduced to cover the remaining empty space to form a composite by curing the resin. The fiber preform permeability {{plays a key role}} in the filling pattern of the mold, which dictates if there will be any voids (empty spaces) in the composite. Permeability tensor describes the resistance to fluid flow through the anisotropic fibrous porous media, which may not be spatially uniform. The variability in the permeability due to the variation in the preform or its placement in the mold can influence the filling pattern and hence the quality of the part being manufactured. The permeability map of a preform specifies the values of components of the permeability tensor at various locations of the preform. The overall objective of this dissertation is to investigate various approaches and tools to create a permeability map that will ensure filling to achieve manufacturing success despite the variability of the filling pattern, a requirement of robust process design. When <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabrics</b> are used to manufacture composites, they are typically stacked on top of each other to build up the desired thickness. A slight misalignment during the stacking can change the through-thickness permeability dramatically and the flow pattern due to the creation of low-resistance pathways. Experimental characterization of the out-of-plane or through-thickness permeability of a series of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabrics</b> stacked in various orientations is investigated. Also, numerical simulations are conducted to predict the effect of change in fiber orientation on the through-thickness permeability for <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Results demonstrate that the stacking sequence of the <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabrics</b> influence the through thickness flow and hence the transverse permeability. Next, variation in the permeability value of the fibrous domain caused by the non-uniformity in fiber architecture is investigated. The time evolution and geometry of the rough interfaces of the fluid flow in porous medium are analyzed using the concepts of dynamic scaling and self-affine fractal geometry and is shown to belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Additionally, this characterization can be used to quantify the percentage of abnormalities within the preform from flow front profile analysis using KPZ formulation. Finally, a methodology is introduced to create a permeability map for a given mold geometry along with inlet and vent locations which will allow the mold to completely fill despite the variations in the preform and the flow disturbances caused due to its placement. The resin flow pattern can be manipulated with a tailored highly permeable layer (Distribution Media (DM)) layout to be placed on top of the preform as it does impact the flow patterns significantly. Thus, a predictive tool to design an optimal shape of DM, which accounts for the flow variability introduced due to race tracking along the edges of the inserts is presented by adapting a discrete optimization algorithm.

40|$|Abstract. A hybrid {{finite element}} {{discrete}} mesoscopic approach {{is used to}} model the forming of composite parts using a unidirectional glass prepreg non-crimp fabric (NCF). The tensile behavior of the fabric is represented using 1 -D beam elements, and the shearing behavior is captured using 2 -D shell elements in an Abaqus/Explicit finite element model via a user-defined material subroutine. The forming of a hemisphere is simulated using a finite element model of the fabric, {{and the results are}} compared to a thermostamped part as a demonstration of the capabilities of the used methodology.

40|$|More {{fundamental}} {{test methods}} {{are needed to}} assist the development of physically based and truly predictive simulation tools for composite materials under crash conditions. In this paper, a unidirectional flat specimen {{that can be used}} to validate the predicted behaviour from a simulation to the physical behaviour in the experiment is developed. A systematic experimental investigation is conducted to evaluate the influence of the trigger geometry on the crushing response by selecting two trigger types and different trigger angles. For longitudinal crushing, the traditional bevel trigger leads to out-of-plane failure by splaying with a limited amount of in-plane fracture, while the proposed trigger achieves a high amount of compressive fragmentation failure. For transverse crushing, the symmetry of the proposed new trigger improves the specimen stability during the crushing process. It is also observed that the weft threads of the <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabric</b> reinforcement used for the tests have a strong influence on the longitudinal crushing response. The boundary conditions of the test and the information on the specimen failure gleaned from video recordings and microscopic inspections are discussed in order to facilitate a future correlation with modelling results...|$|E

Currently the awareness of using FRP increases rapidly in engineering fields and also among public. Retrofitting becomes vital for aged and damaged concrete structures, piles, and so forth, to improve its load carrying capacity and to extend the service life. The load carrying capacity of piles retrofitted with basalt <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabric</b> was studied experimentally. 15 nos. of RCC end bearing pile elements were cast with same reinforcement for axial compression experiment. Three piles were used as conventional elements, another 3 piles were used as double BFRP wrapped pile elements, and remaining 9 piles were used as retrofitted piles with BFRP double wrapping after preloaded to 30 %, 60 %, and 90 % of ultimate load of conventional element. The effects of retrofitting of RCC pile elements were observed and a mathematical prediction was developed for calculation of retrofitting strength. The stress vs. strain relationship curve, load vs. deformation curve, preloaded elements strength losses are tabulated and plotted. Besides, crack patterns of conventional elements and tearing BFRP wrapped elements were also observed. The BFRP wrapped elements and retrofitted elements withstand more axial compressive load than the conventional elements...|$|E
40|$|Manual layup {{has been}} a common method in the {{manufacture}} of composite structures for complex geometries. However, when production volumes and/or the quality requirements increase, there is an urgent need for solutions to automate the layup process. In addition, the trend in designing composite structures with increasingly larger dimensions and more complex geometries requires advanced process planning tools to optimize process parameters and guarantee the feasibility of the layup process. This dissertation presents a three-phased study on the development of automated and optimized process planning tools for the layup of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabrics</b> onto complex three-dimensional mold surfaces. The first phase of the study introduces the development of a laser scanning based measurement system, with the capability of measuring in-plane shear and out-of-plane deformations of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabrics</b> at the resolution of tow level. Based on this fabric deformation measurement approach, the second phase of study analyzes the effects of process parameters on the generation of different deformation modes and the transformation between them. The findings from the analyses were further explored to provide generalized solutions for improving the process of fabric layup in the third phase of the study, where two process planning tools are presented: pre-shearing planning and in-process manipulation planning. It has been verified by both simulation and experiments that these process planning tools are effective in increasing the drapability of the fabrics and in securing a feasible layup plan. Implementation approaches in layup process automation and composite structure design for manufacturability are also presented. The results of this dissertation can provide a path toward automated composite manufacturing that is both cost effective and reduces variability leading to flaws in large complex composites...|$|R
40|$|Most {{commercial}} available {{natural fibre}} composites {{are based on}} random discontinuous fibre composite systems. The development of continuous natural fibre reinforced polymers is essential for manufacturing materials {{that can be used}} in load bearing applications. Similar to traditional composite polymer materials, high-performance natural fibre composite systems should be based on continuous textile reinforcements like unidirectional tapes or woven fabrics. The first problem to be addressed in this process is the optimisation of the yarn to be used in the manufacturing of the textile reinforcement. Subsequently, a number of different fabric types (i. e. biaxial plain weaves, <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabrics</b> and non-crimp fabrics) were produced and evaluated as reinforcement in composites manufactured by well established manufacturing techniques such as hand lay-up, vacuum infusion, pultrusion and resin transfer moulding (RTM). As expected, the developed materials can not directly compete in terms of strength with unidirectional glass fibre composites. However, they are clearly able to compete with these materials in terms of stiffness, especially if the low density of flax is taken into account. High mechanical properties were obtained for unidirectional flax composite material...|$|R

Pultruded quasi-isotropic composite beams were selected as an option over extruded aluminum alloy structures because of the lower cost potential, the higher specific strength, the flexural properties, and the dynamic similarity considerations. The reinforcement material that was used was biaxial (0 deg/ 90 deg) fiberglass roving held in place with knitted polyester yarn such that equal fiber volume in 0 deg and 90 deg orientations provided nearly equal strength in both longitudinal and transverse directions. An isophthalic polyester resin system {{was used as the}} matrix. Continuous lengths up to 270 ft were easily pultruded with biaxial fabric. Tracking problems were encountered with similar <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Analyses of processing problems were conducted to determine causes for delamination, scaling, and sloughing.

40|$|In most cases, fabrics such as curtains, skirts, suit {{pants and}} so on are draped under their own gravity {{parallel}} to fabric plane while the gravity is perpendicular to fabric plane in traditional drape testing method. As a result, it does not conform to actual situation and the test data is not convincing enough. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a novel method which simulates the real mechanical conditions and ensures the gravity {{is parallel to the}} fabric plane. This method applied a low-cost Kinect Sensor device to capture the 3 -dimensional (3 D) drape profile, thus we obtained the drape degree parameters and aesthetic parameters by 3 D reconstruction and image processing and analysis techniques. The experiment was conducted on our self-devised drape-testing instrument by choosing different kinds of weave structure fabrics as our testing samples and the results were compared with those of traditional method and subjective evaluation. Through regression and correlation analysis we found that this novel testing method was significantly correlated with the traditional and subjective evaluation method. We achieved a new, non-contact 3 D measurement method for drape testing, namely <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabric</b> drape testing method. This method is more suitable for evaluating drape behavior because it is more in line with actual mechanical conditions of draped fabrics and has a well consistency with the requirements of visual and aesthetic style of fabrics...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of fabric {{manipulation}} on performance of unidirectional non-crimp fiber reinforced polymer composites. Conventionally hand layup process is being followed in wind turbine manufacturing industries which is a time consuming process. To overcome the long man labor, automatic layup method {{could be used to}} make the process faster. Before implementing the automatic layup process in industries, it is essential to study how in-plane wave caused by shifting is going to affect the properties of the fabric and thus predict the life of the fabric. Fatigue and compressive tests were conducted on the fabric to study the behavior of the fabric in actual wind turbine manufacturing applications. Samples were made by stacking four layers of fabric one over each other with a definite shift angles and then followed by resin infusion and then cut the coupons for testing. Stacking of in-plane wave samples over each other resulted in formation of out of plane waviness. Eight coupons per shift angles of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 degree were cut out for tests. Compression loading and compression fatigue testing was performed on the samples to characterize the properties. The maximum strength level concentration acted on the point of grip on the fabric sample.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{consisting of}} high-strength fibers embedded in inorganic matrix (Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Mortar materials, FRCM) {{are becoming more}} and more widespread as strengthening technique for existing masonry structures because of the higher compatibility of the inorganic matrix with the masonry supports compared with the epoxy adhesives, the lower sensitivity to debonding phenomena at the interface, and the â€˜gridâ€™ configuration of the reinforcement, particularly suitable for strengthening bi-dimensional elements. Conversely, the use of lime or cement-based mortar implies that attention has to be payed also to the bond behavior between the fibers and the matrix, since sliding phenomena and cohesive failures in the mortar frequently occur. Thus, for the FRCM materials the knowledge of the bond behavior both at the fiber/matrix and at the composite/substrate interface is fundamental to correctly assess their performance as strengthening of masonry elements. The experimental tests discussed in this paper show different aspects of the bond behavior of the FRCM materials in order to validate an experimental methodology for such a strengthening technique. In particular, tensile tests on coupons made of different FRCM materials were carried out in order to investigate the interaction between fibers and mortar and the bond strength at the fiber/mortar interface. Then, the bond behavior between different FRCM systems and a masonry substrate made of Neapolitan yellow tuff was investigated by shear bond tests according to a single push-pull set-up. The experimental tests were carried out on three types of fibers embedded in cement-based grouts: a balanced glass grid (G-FRCM, i. e. Glass Fibers Reinforced Cementitious Mortar system), and two types of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabric</b> made of steel cords (SRG, i. e. Steel Reinforced Grout system) with different density.

A {{comparison between the}} theoretical and experimental values of the thermoelastic signal is reported, with the theoretical predictions obtained from two different quantitative models. These models {{are based on the}} classic thermoelastic effect law extended to the case of orthotropic materials (by using the mesomechanical or bulk approach), and the modified law assuming that the surface resin-rich layer behaves as a strain witness of the laminate. It is found that the theoretical predictions of the two models can be strongly and differently influenced by the intrinsic orthotropy of carbon fibres. Some effects are highlighted in particular such as the influence of the laminate lay-up and the strong mismatch between the thermal expansion coefficients of the polymer matrix and the fibres. These influences are investigated analytically, predicting the thermoelastic signal from various lay-ups and using strain-based and stress-based analytical models.

40|$|The Hyblean Plateau {{in southeastern}} Sicily, Italy, {{consists}} of an isolated and elevated forebulge structure formed since the early Miocene time by bending the foreland lithosphere below the advancing Maghrebian thrust-fold belt. The Hyblean forebulge is presently located {{in front of an}} orogenic recess and partly surrounded by two orogenic salients. We analyzed magnetic (anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility) and structural (joints, faults, slickenside lineations, and bed attitudes) fabric data from Neogene carbonate rocks exposed atop the Hyblean forebulge. Results showed <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabrics</b> developed in response to a NW-SE extension at the end the of early Miocene time and beginning of middle Miocene time, and duple-to-multiple fabrics developed in response to major NW-SE and NE-SW extensions from the Langhian time onward. We interpreted these results as the evidence for the growth of a doubly plunging forebulge due to the presence of foreland crustal heterogeneities, which enhanced differential retreating processes of the foreland along the subduction zone and the subsequent formation of orogenic salients and recesses. A semianalytical model shows that the observed brittle deformations potentially involved a significant thickness of the carbonate sedimentary cover, thereby reducing the lithosphere flexural rigidity and enhancing its bending aptitude...|$|R

Two different bidirectional flax fabrics were used to produce flax fabric reinforced plastic (FFRP) laminates by a vacuum bagging process: one is normally used to make curtains; the other, heavier and {{more expensive than the}} previous one, is usually used as reinforcement in composite structures. In order to realize hybrid structures starting from FFRP, an <b>unidirectional</b> UHM carbon <b>fabric</b> was used to replace a bidirectional flax fabric.

Moreover, both FFRP laminates show low mechanical properties, which do not allow their use in structural applications while the presence of one external layer of unidirectional carbon involves remarkable increase in their properties.

This project has two objectives: (1) To evaluate the behavior and advantages of longitudinal glulam deck panels reinforced with Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (FRP) and (2) To evaluate existing AASHTO empirical TSB design criteria. The tension-reinforced deck panels can alleviate reliance on high grade wood laminations and allow longer spans and lighter decks. The new panels have the middle two-thlrds of the tension side reinforced with longitudinal E-glass FRP. The researchaddressed {{the selection of the}} FRP material system, the manufacturing process used for applying the reinforcement to the panels, the structural and economic benefits of FRPglulam panels, and the durability of the FRP. The approach included design, laboratory manufacture, and construction of a municipal pier in Milbridge, Maine. Wet-impregnated <b>unidirectional</b> E-glass <b>fabric...</b>|$|R

The original cross beams from the HCB were substantially deficient in shear strength, {{particularly for the}} projected increase in traffic loads. One control beam and three beams with varying configurations of a carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and a {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) were constructed to simulate the retrofit of the actual HCB cross beams. CFRP <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fabrics</b> were applied to increase flexural capacity and GFRP unidirectional sheets to mitigate shear failure. Thirdpoint bending tests were conducted, and load, deflection and strain data were collected. Fiber optic sensors and conventional resistive gauges were placed to provide an overall behavioral understanding of the unstrengthened and strengthened beams. Results revealed that the FRP composite strengthening provided static (total applied third-point load) capacity increases of 45 % for the addition of either CFRP or GFRP when compared to the unstrengthened beam. The addition of both CFRP and GFRP increased the moment capacity by 100 %. Post cracking stiffness of all beams was increased primarily due to the flexural CFRP. Results suggest that the experimental beams retrofit with both the designed GFRP and CFRP should well exceed the bridge design load of 530 ft-kips, sustaining up to 640 ft-kips applied moment. The addition of GFRP alone for shear was sufficient to offset the lack of steel stirrups and allow for a conventional reinforced concrete beam failure by yielding of the tension steel followed by crushing of the concrete. The resulting ultimate deflections of the shear GFRP reinforced beam were nearly twice those of the pre-existing shear deficient beam. Experimental beams retrofit with only the designed CFRP still failed as a result of diagonal tension cracks, albeit at a 45 % greater load than for the unstrengthened beam. The experimental beam retrofit with only the designed shear GFRP failed in flexure at the midspan at a 45 % higher load than the control specimen, with the failure mechanism in this case being yielding of the tension steel followed by concrete crushing. A design method for flexure and shear was proposed before the onset of this experimental study. The design procedure for flexure was refined and allows for predicting the response of the beam at any applied moment. The flexural design procedure includes provisions for non-crushing failure modes, and was shown to be slightly conservative using the design material properties...|$|R
