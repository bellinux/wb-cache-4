There are {{numerous}} customer classifications resulting in complex tariffs that vary, among others, {{depending on the}} customer’s line of business, the effluent produced by the customer, the seasonality of water use, and a customer’s distance from the water mains. Many water tariffs are uniform, i.e. the same tariff applies for each <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption,</b> if the water use is metered at all.

For the case of wilderness hiking, the latent approach provides a statistically better model of site choice than other standard methods. ...|$|R

50|$|Resource {{intensity}} {{is a measure}} of the resources (e.g. water, energy, materials) needed for the production, processing and disposal of a unit of good or service, or for the completion of a process or activity; it is therefore a measure of the efficiency of resource use. It is often expressed as the quantity of resource embodied in unit cost e.g. litres of water per $1 spent on product. In national economic and sustainability accounting it can be calculated as units of resource expended per unit of GDP. When applied to a single person it is expressed as the resource use of that person per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption.</b> Relatively high resource intensities indicate a high price or environmental cost of converting resource into GDP; low resource intensity indicates a lower price or environmental cost of converting resource into GDP.|$|E

We use relative prices so we can say how many units of equipment can be bought instead (or in terms) of buying one unit of consumer goods.
