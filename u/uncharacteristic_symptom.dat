40|$|Intussusception {{in adults}} is {{generally}} a rare diagnosis and generally different from intussusception in children {{in terms of}} clinical presentation, etiology, and incidence (Begos et al., Am J Surg, 173 : 88 - 94, 1997; Watson and Bisset, Clin Radiol, 49 : 723 - 726, 1994; Felix et al., Am J Surg, 131 : 723 - 726, 1976). One third of these affect the large bowel. Adult intussusception shows clinically <b>uncharacteristic</b> <b>symptoms</b> of bowel obstruction; thus, the diagnosis is often clinically missed. We report {{the case of a}} 39 -year-old woman suffering from long-term abdominal pain. This case report discusses the clinical advantages of multislice computed tomography for the diagnosis of adult intussusception and shows a comprehensive overview of the literature...|$|R

40|$|Background: Owing to <b>uncharacteristic</b> <b>symptoms,</b> glandular {{stomach cancer}} (adenocarcinoma) is usually {{diagnosed}} at an advanced stage, when the prognosisis poor. Research showed that these tumours are very heterogeneous interms of their molecular structure. Gastric cancer {{is believed to}} result from a multistep process encompassing different genomic, genetic and epigenetic changes. It is widely acknowledged that its development {{is the result of}} an interplay between genetic background of patients, accumulation ofalterations in genes, and environmental risk factors. Studies, conducted over the last few decades, revealed numerous mutated genes, which could be associated with the risk of gastric cancer development. Unfortunately, the pathways and molecular sequences underlying the initiation and progression of normal cells into malignant ones have not been clearly explained yet. The purpose of this review is to present molecular mechanisms most likely implicated in gastric cancer development...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis is an {{infectious}} disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex mycobacteria. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis usually develops {{more than two}} years after infection or many years later. Factors favoring onset of the disease are malnutrition, older age, renal failure, diabetes, cancer, immunosuppression and biological treatment, e. g. tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) inhibitors. The paper presents a case of a  56 -year-old patient with ankylosing spondylitis treated with infliximab, diagnosed with tuberculosis of the spleen. The unusual location and <b>uncharacteristic</b> <b>symptoms</b> created a lot of diagnostic difficulties, particularly as during qualification for biological treatment tests are performed to exclude infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Pharmacological treatment of tuberculosis is typical, {{but in the case of}} tuberculosis of the spleen, splenectomy also is a method of treatment. The decision was made to implement pharmacological treatment, which proved to be effective, so the patient avoided surgery...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The West Nile virus (WNV) mainly infects birds, {{horses and}} humans. Outcomes of the {{infection}} range from light <b>uncharacteristic</b> <b>symptoms</b> to fatal neurologic disease. The Hungarian equine WNV outbreak reported in 2008 was the ﬁrst {{caused by a}} lineage 2 sub-Saharan strain in Europe. To protect horses from serious disease an inactivated virus vaccine is available in Hungary since 2009. Objectives: The main objectives {{of the present study}} were to measure serum IgG and IgM antibodies in naturally exposed and vaccinated horses, and to compare hemagglutination-inhibition test (HIT) results with those of competitive and IgM antibody capture (MAC) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Methods: Altogether 268 animals were tested with HIT for WNV antibodies and 34 horses were examined for both IgG and IgM with HIT and ELISA simultaneously. After primary screening for WNV antibodies, all horses were vaccinated. Samples were taken immediately before and 3 - 5 weeks after each vaccination. McNemar chi-squared and percent agreement tests were used to detect concordance between HIT and ELISA. Results: Analyses by HIT confirmed the presence of WNV antibodies in 38 / 123 (30, 89...|$|R
50|$|The Bonn Scale for the Assessment of Basic Symptoms {{was created}} to assess sub-clinical affective, {{cognitive}} and perceptual disturbances, as well as basic self-disturbance, in people, and in many studies basic symptoms were found to aggregate in people with schizophrenic and schizotypal disorders. Basic symptoms are subjective and difficult for the person to describe spontaneously, but the person will try to adapt and cope with them: functioning becomes impaired when people reach their adaptive capacity. In the period {{leading up to the}} first episode of schizophrenia, <b>uncharacteristic</b> basic <b>symptoms</b> first appear and are followed by the onset of more characteristic basic symptoms and, finally, psychosis.|$|R
5000|$|Basic {{symptoms}} {{often appear}} {{several years before}} the onset of psychosis, but are often preceded by the onset of self-disorders (see supplementary material at [...] ). They may sometimes appear and then disappear before appearing again much later, where they occur as part of an outpost syndrome. At one point, <b>uncharacteristic</b> basic <b>symptoms</b> will appear, which comprise various disturbances of mood, emotions, drive, thought, and attention that can occur in many other disorders, followed by the characteristic basic symptoms, which comprise disturbances of thought, perception, and attention, along with minor reality distortion, that are associated with schizophrenia in particular. Afterward, attenuated symptoms of psychosis or brief periods of psychosis will appear, before culminating in the emergence of full-blown psychosis. At any stage before psychosis, the person will attempt to cope with the basic symptoms, which might conceal the problems from others; once the person reaches the limit of their ability to compensate, however, the problems will become evident to others and cause impairment.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Patients with <b>uncharacteristic</b> {{inflammatory}} <b>symptoms</b> such as long-standing fatigue or pain, or {{a prolonged}} fever, constitute a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The {{aim of the}} present study was to determine if an extended immunophenotyping of lymphocytes and monocytes including activation markers can define disease-specific patterns, and thus provide valuable diagnostic information for these patients. Methods Whole blood from patients with gram-negative bacteraemia, neuroborreliosis, tuberculosis, acute mononucleosis, influenza or a mixed connective tissue disorders, as diagnosed by routine culture and serology techniques was analysed for lymphocyte and monocyte cell surface markers using a no-wash, no-lyse protocol for multi-colour flow cytometry method. The immunophenotyping included the activation markers HLA-DR and CD 40. Plasma levels of soluble TNF alpha receptors were analysed by ELISA. Results An informative pattern was obtained by combining two of the analysed parameters: (i), the fractions of HLA-DR-expressing CD 4 + T cells and CD 8 + T cells, respectively, and (ii), the level of CD 40 on CD 14 + CD 16 - monocytes. Patients infected with gram-negative bacteria or EBV showed a marked increase in monocyte CD 40, while this effect was less pronounced for tuberculosis, borrelia and influenza. The bacterial agents could be distinguished from the viral agents by the T cell result; CD 4 + T cells reacting in bacterial infection, and the CD 8 + T cells dominating for the viruses. Patients with mixed connective tissue disorders also showed increased activation, but with similar engagement of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. Analysis of soluble TNF alpha receptors was less informative due to a large inter-individual variation. Conclusion Immunophenotyping including the combination of the fractions of HLA-DR expressing T cell subpopulations with the level of CD 40 on monocytes produces an informative pattern, differentiating between infections of bacterial and viral origin. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis of these parameters revealed the novel finding of characteristic patterns indicating a subacute bacterial infection, such as borreliosis or tuberculosis, or a mixed connective tissue disorder. The employed flow cytometric method is suitable for clinical diagnostic laboratories, and may help in the assessment of patients with <b>uncharacteristic</b> inflammatory <b>symptoms.</b> </p...|$|R
50|$|Basic {{symptoms}} of schizophrenia are subjective symptoms, described as experienced from a person's perspective, which show evidence of underlying psychopathology. Basic symptoms {{have generally been}} applied to the assessment of people who {{may be at risk}} to develop psychosis. Though basic symptoms are often disturbing for the person, problems generally do not become evident to others until the person is no longer able to cope with their basic symptoms. In the prodrome to psychosis, <b>uncharacteristic</b> basic <b>symptoms</b> develop first, followed by more characteristic basic symptoms and brief and self-limited psychotic-like symptoms, and finally the onset of psychosis. In 2015, the European Psychiatric Association issued guidance recommending the use of a subscale of basic symptoms, called the Cognitive Disturbances scale (COGDIS), in the assessment of psychosis risk in help-seeking psychiatric patients; in a meta-analysis, COGDIS was shown to be as predictive of transition to psychosis as the Ultra High Risk (UHR) criteria up to 2 years after assessment, and significantly more predictive thereafter. The basic symptoms measured by COGDIS, as well as those measured by another subscale, the Cognitive-Perceptive basic symptoms scale (COPER), are predictive of transition to schizophrenia.|$|R

It often presents with symptoms of chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction of colon. We report {{a case of}} visceral myopathy which presented to us as acute appendicitis and Ogilvie syndrome, and we managed it surgically. Method and Result. A case report of 20 -year female clinically presented as acute appendicitis and we performed laparoscopic exploration which revealed inflamed appendix with grossly dilated ascending colon. We performed laparoscopic appendectomy and postoperatively managed the patients with IV fluids, antibiotics, neostigmine, and extended length rectal tube for enema and decompression.

40|$|Background Hepatorenal tyrosinaemia (Tyr 1) {{is a rare}} {{inborn error}} of {{tyrosine}} metabolism. Without treatment, patients {{are at high risk}} of developing acute liver failure, renal dysfunction and in the long run hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of our study was to collect cross-sectional data. MethodsVia questionnaires we collected retrospective data of 168 patients with Tyr 1 from 21 centres (Europe, Turkey and Israel) about diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and outcome. In a subsequent consensus workshop, we discussed data and clinical implications. ResultsEarly treatment by NTBC accompanied by diet is essential to prevent serious complications such as liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma and renal disease. As patients may remain initially asymptomatic or develop <b>uncharacteristic</b> clinical <b>symptoms</b> in the first months of life newborn mass screening using succinylacetone (SA) as a screening parameter in dried blood is mandatory for early diagnosis. NTBC-treatment has to be combined with natural protein restriction supplemented with essential amino acids. NTBC dosage should be reduced to the minimal dose allowing metabolic control, once daily dosing may be an option in older children and adults in order to increase compliance. Metabolic control is judged by SA (below detection limit) in dried blood or urine, plasma tyrosine (< 400  ¿M) and NTBC-levels in the therapeutic range (20 ¿ 40  ¿M). Side effects of NTBC are mild and often transient. Indications for liver transplantation are hepatocellular carcinoma or failure to respond to NTBC. Follow-up procedures should include liver and kidney function tests, tumor markers and imaging, ophthalmological examination, blood count, psychomotor and intelligence testing as well as therapeutic monitoring (SA, tyrosine, NTBC in blood). ConclusionBased on the data from 21 centres treating 168 patients we were able to characterize current practice and clinical experience in Tyr 1.
