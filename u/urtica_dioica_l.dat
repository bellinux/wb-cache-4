40|$|Although the European flora {{belongs to}} the best {{explored}} at the global scale, still there are several largely neglected plant groups, which may surprise by marked variation. One of these groups is <b>Urtica</b> <b>dioica</b> s. <b>l.,</b> consisting of vaguely described taxa (microspecies / subspecies) with indefinite distribution. The most important source of variation in U. <b>dioica</b> s. <b>l.</b> is probably polyploidy (2 x, 4 x; x = 13). The complex comprises an ubiquitous tetraploid cytotype (U. dioica s. str.) and several obscurely defined relict 2 x taxa. The cytogeographical analysis through Europe (770 populations / over 3 200 individuals) revealed marked distribution pattern of U. <b>dioica</b> s. <b>l.</b> cytotypes.

40|$|Abstract Background Rotaviruses are {{the single}} most {{important}} cause of severe diarrhea in young children worldwide. The developments of specific, potent and accessible antiviral treatments that restrain rotavirus infection remain important to control rotavirus disease. Methods 150 plant extracts with nutritional applications were screened in vitro on MA- 104 cells for their antiviral activity against rhesus rotavirus (RRV). One extract (Aspalathus linearis (Burm. f.) R. Dahlgren) was also tested for its effect on the loss of transepithelial resistance (TER) of Caco- 2 cells caused by simian rotavirus (SA- 11) infection. Results Aqueous extracts of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. fruit, <b>Urtica</b> <b>dioica</b> <b>L.</b> root, Aspalathus linearis (Burm. f.) R. Dahlgren leaves, Glycyrrhiza glabra L. root and Olea europaea L. leaves were found to have strong significant antiviral activity with a 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) [*] Glycyrrhiza glabra was found to have the strongest antiviral activity (IC 50 46 [*]μM), followed by luteolin and vitexin from Aspalathus linearis (IC 50 respectively 116 [*]μM and 129 [*]μM) and apigenin- 7 -O-glucoside from Melissa officinalis (IC 50 150 [*]μM). A combination of Glycyrrhiza glabra L. + Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. and <b>Urtica</b> <b>dioica</b> <b>L.</b> + Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. showed synergy in their anti-viral activities.

40|$|International audienceThis {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{to explore the}} potential of extract of leaves Nettle (<b>Urtica</b> <b>dioica</b> <b>L.)</b> of Tunisia as sources of minerals and natural antioxidants. Two extraction methods were used and compared, the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) with carbon dioxide (CO 2) and traditional maceration extraction using ethanol (EtOH) as solvent. The SFE was explored at various operating conditions of pression (15 and 18 MPa) and temperature (40 and 60 °C) (with or without glass beads). The phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined respectively by Folin-Ciocalteu and Aluminium chloride colorimetric method. The ABTS assay was used for determining the antioxidant activity. The protein assay was performed by the Kjeldahl method and the multielemental analysis by atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma. The results show some variations between both extracts in terms of extraction yield and antioxidant activity. The SFE, with carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) is an interesting alternative to the conventional extraction using organic solvents. However, higher values of phenolic content (11. 62 mg GAE. g- 1 DW), flavonoid content (7. 10 mgCE. g- 1 DW) and antioxidant activity TEAC (8. 11 μM) correspond to extracts obtained by maceration. In all SFE extract assays, the highest yield was reached at 60 °C – 15 MPa with glass beads (2. 5 %).

40|$|Abstract Background Herbaceous {{plants are}} common vegetal species {{generally}} exposed, {{for a limited}} period of time, to bioavailable environmental pollutants. Heavy metals contamination {{is the most common}} form of environmental pollution. Herbaceous plants have never been used as natural bioindicators of environmental pollution, in particular to monitor the amount of heavy metals in soil. In this study, we aimed at assessing the usefulness of using three herbaceous plants (Plantago major L., Taraxacum officinale L. and <b>Urtica</b> <b>dioica</b> <b>L.)</b> and one leguminous (Trifolium pratense L.) as alternative indicators to evaluate soil pollution by heavy metals. Results We employed Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) to assess the concentration of selected heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Mn, Pb, Cr and Pd) in soil and plants and we employed statistical analyses to describe the linear correlation between the accumulation of some heavy metals and selected vegetal species. We found that the leaves of Taraxacum officinale L. and Trifolium pratense L. can accumulate Cu in a linearly dependent manner with <b>Urtica</b> <b>dioica</b> <b>L.</b> representing the vegetal species accumulating the highest fraction of Pb.

The leaves and roots both are used internally as a blood purifier and diuretic and an infusion of the plant is used for nasal and men-strual haemorrhage, diabetes, rheumatism, eczema, anaemia, hair loss, as an expectorant and antidiarrhoeal. Present study includes pharmacognostic evaluation, antioxidant activity and HPTLC analysis of <b>Urtica</b> <b>dioica</b> <b>L.</b> Methods: Pharmacognostic evaluation of aerial part of U. dioica has been performed as per Indian pharmacopoeia. In vitro anti-oxidant evaluation of U. dioica has been performed using DPPH free radical scavenging activity. Ferulic acid, a poten-tial phenolic antioxidant present in this species, has been studied through HPTLC. Results: U. dioica hydro-alcoholic extract shows positive results for antioxidant activity with IC 50 value of 88. 33 ± 2. 88 µg/ml. Standard ascorbic acid showed IC 50 value of 2. 8 ± 0. 62 µg/ml. Ferulic acid was identified at Rf 0. 61 ± 0. 01 and quantified to 0. 73 % in this spe-cies through CAMAG HPTLC analysis. Conclusion: The pharmacognostical parameters reported can be considered as quality standards of U. dioica in herbal industry. Hydro-alcoholic extract of U. dioica showed positive in vitro antioxi-dant activity. Presence of phenolic compound suggests that antioxidant activity may be due to ferulic acid content...|$|E
