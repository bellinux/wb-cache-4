By 2016, the port is expected to have the capacity to handle over 80 million tons of cargo and its coal-handling capacity is expected to be about 43 million tons. The port is equipped to handle 16 million tonnes of coal per year from its two dedicated coal berths with 15m alongside depth and manned by TNEB, while its third berth promoted by Chettinad International Coal Terminal, is a common <b>user</b> <b>facility</b> that can handle 8 million tonnes per annum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{intensity}} of X-ray sources has increased {{at a rapid}} rate since the late 1960 s by 10 orders of magnitude and more {{through the use of}} synchrotron radiation produced by bending magnets, wigglers and undulators. Three generations of radiation sources have been identified depending on amplitude and quality of the radiation provided. While <b>user</b> <b>facilities</b> of the third generation were being constructed a new concept of radiation generating devices was being developed that offers an even larger increase in peak and average brightness than had been achieved till then. The new concept of the X-ray Free Electron Laser based on the principle of Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission will be the basis of fourth generation X-ray source <b>user</b> <b>facilities</b> of this century. The paper will start with a brief history of the development of x-ray sources, discuss some of the differences between storage ring and free electron laser based approaches, and close with an update of the present development of x-ray free electron laser <b>user</b> <b>facilities.</b> Submitted to...|$|R
