40|$|The 5 &# 039; {{adenosine}} monophosphate-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric, evolutionary conserved enzyme which {{has emerged as}} a critical regulator of skeletal muscle cellular bioenergetics. AMPK is activated by both chemical (adipokines) and mechanical (stretch, contraction) stimuli leading to metabolic changes within muscle cells that include increased fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake and glycolysis, as well as the stimulation and regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Collectively these acute responses and chronic adaptations act to reduce cellular disturbances, resulting in tighter metabolic control and maintenance of energy homeostasis.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that nicotinic {{cholinergic}} agonists induce muscle cell degeneration. Although an involvement of calcium is well documented, subsequent intracellular steps have not been identified. The present experiments test whether nitric oxide (NO) may play such a role. Both the irreversible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L- 5 N-iminoethyl ornithine and L-nitroarginine methyl ester, a reversible inhibitor, protected the muscle cells from the myopathic effects of nicotine. These results may suggest that nicotinic receptor stimulation produces an increase in NO that results in muscle cell degeneration.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Herein {{we report}} a study {{combining}} metab-olomics and mass isotopomer analysis used for {{investigation of the}} biochemical fate of γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). Using various 13 C incorporation labeling patterns into GHB, we have discovered that GHB is catabolized by previously unknown processes that include (i) direct β-oxidation to acetyl-CoA and glycolate, (ii) α-oxidation to 3 -hydroxypropionyl-CoA and formate, and (iii) cleavage of C- 4 to yield 3 -hydroxypropionate and CO 2. We further utilized the unique attributes of our labeling patterns and the resultant isotopomers to quantitate relative flux down the identified pathways. γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>molecule</b> in vivo, derived both endogenously (from the metabolism of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid, GABA) 1, 2 and exoge-nously {{in the form of}} a drug of abuse or prescriptio...|$|E

Among a plethora of physiological actions, adenosine has {{an important role in}} attenuating ischaemia-reperfusion injury and modulating the ensuing fibrosis and tissue remodeling following myocardial damage. Adenosine exerts these actions through interaction with four adenosine G protein-coupled receptors expressed in the heart. The adenosine A 2 B receptor (A 2 BAR) is the most abundant adenosine receptor (AR) in cardiac fibroblasts and is largely responsible for the influence of adenosine on cardiac fibrosis. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that acute A 2 BAR stimulation can decrease fibrosis through the inhibition of fibroblast proliferation and reduction in collagen synthesis. However, in contrast, there is also evidence that chronic A 2 BAR antagonism reduces tissue fibrosis.

Therefore, novel NO donors with better pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties are highly desirable. The S-nitrosothiol fraction in plasma is largely composed of endogenous S-nitrosated human serum albumin (Mono-SNO-HSA), and that is why we are testing whether this albumin form can be therapeutically useful. Recently, we developed SNO-HSA analogs such as SNO-HSA with many conjugated SNO groups (Poly-SNO-HSA) which were prepared using chemical modification. Unexpectedly, we found striking inverse effects between Poly-SNO-HSA and Mono-SNO-HSA. Despite the fact that Mono-SNO-HSA inhibits apoptosis, Poly-SNO-HSA possesses very strong proapoptotic effects against tumor cells. Furthermore, Poly-SNO-HSA can reduce or perhaps completely eliminate the multidrug resistance often developed by cancer cells.

In most vertebrates, including humans, melatonin is synthesized primarily in the pineal gland and is regulated by the environmental light ⁄ dark cycle via the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Melatonin is synthesized in all areas of the body such as gastrointestinal tract, skin, bone marrow, retina and in lymphocytes, from which it may influence other physiological functions through paracrine signalling. In addition to regulation of circadian rhythm of melatonin a variety of other physiological effects such as hypnotic, antidepressant, antiepileptic, oncostatic, immunomodulatory, antiosteoporotic, in cardiovascular disease, neuromodulatory and cerebral ischaemic condition have been reported. Moreover there is scarcity of literature that reviewed the scientific evidence for its use in these conditions. Therefore in this article we review recent advances in this research field, which is preceded by a concise account of general information about melatonin, melatonin receptors and intracellular signalling pathways for melatonin actions...|$|E

The zebrafish genome contains 10 glypican homologs, as opposed to six in mammals, which are highly conserved and are phylogenetically related to the mammalian genes. Some of the fish glypicans like Gpc 1 a, Gpc 3, Gpc 4, Gpc 6 a and Gpc 6 b show conserved synteny with their mammalian cognate genes. Many glypicans are expressed during the gastrulation stage, but their expression becomes more tissue specific and defined during somitogenesis stages, particularly in the developing central nervous system.

There has been much speculation on what may be the trigger for HSP 70 upregulation during stress. One hypothesis is that decreased levels of cellular glutathione (GSH) may be involved in HSP 70 regulation. GSH is a <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>molecule</b> responsible for the reduction of various oxidants, particularly lipid peroxides, through oxidation of GSH to oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Both GSH levels and GSH/GSSG ratios decrease during various stressors.

A strong expression of immediate-early, early, and late genes was only seen in the T-lymphoblastoma lines. In the other cell lines, there was no clear correlation between the level of transcription and the final outcome of replication. Finally, we investigated the cytopathic effects of HHV- 6 on different cell types of neural origin (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons) in greater detail, and found that although all three sustained HHV- 6 replication, HHV- 6 A was more neurovirulent than HHV- 6 B.
