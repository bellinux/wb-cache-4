The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, {{and returned to the}} courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity. Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} sold {{and the new}} owners, the Deetz family, arrive from New York City. Charles Deetz is a former real estate developer; his wife Delia, a sculptor; and his goth {{daughter}} Lydia, from his first marriage, is an aspiring photographer. Under the guidance of interior designer Otho, Delia begins to transform the house into a posh modern art piece. Consulting the Handbook, the Maitlands travel to a netherworld waiting room populated by other distressed souls, where they discover that the afterlife is structured according to a complex bureaucracy involving vouchers and the usual overworked caseworkers. The Maitlands' own caseworker, Juno, informs them that they must remain {{in the house for}} 125 years. If they want the Deetzes out of the house, it is <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> scare them away. Barbara's and Adam's attempts at scaring the family prove counterproductive, despite their ability to shape-shift into monsters.|$|E

25|$|Children and {{adolescents}} often use the Internet (including social media) in ways which risk their privacy: {{a cause for}} growing concern among parents. Young people also may not realise that all their information and browsing can and may be tracked while visiting a particular site, {{and that it is}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> protect their own privacy. They must be informed about all these risks. For example, on Twitter, threats include shortened links that lead one to potentially harmful places. In their e-mail inbox, threats include email scams and attachments that get them to install malware and disclose personal information. On Torrent sites, threats include malware hiding in video, music, and software downloads. Even when using a smartphone, threats include geolocation, meaning that one's phone can detect where they are and post it online for all to see. Users can protect themselves by updating virus protection, using security settings, downloading patches, installing a firewall, screening e-mail, shutting down spyware, controlling cookies, using encryption, fending off browser hijackers, and blocking pop-ups.|$|E
25|$|The {{common law}} of tort also remains {{particularly}} relevant {{for the type of}} liability an employer has where there is scientific uncertainty about the cause of an injury. In asbestos disease cases, a worker may have been employed with at a number of jobs where he was exposed to asbestos, but his injury cannot with certainty be traced to any one. Although he may be able to sue all of them, a number may have already gone insolvent. In Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd the House of Lords held that if any employer had materially increased the risk of harm to the worker, they could would be jointly and severally liable and could be sued for the full sum, leaving it <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> seek contribution from others and thus the risk of other businesses' insolvency. For a brief period, in Barker v Corus the House of Lords then decided that employers would only be liable on a proportionate basis, thus throwing the risk of employers' insolvency back onto workers. Immediately Parliament passed the Compensation Act 2006 section 3 to reverse the decision on its facts. It has also been held in Chandler v Cape plc, in 2011, that even though a subsidiary company is the direct employer of a worker, a parent company will owe a duty of care. Thus shareholders {{may not be able to}} hide behind the corporate veil to escape their obligations for the health and safety of the workforce.|$|E

If anyone missed it, it was <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> reach the sets. One day, Aamir was late and missed the actors' bus. That day, his wife Reena, the executive producer, reprimanded him for being late. She told him he had to set an example {{for the rest of the}} crew.

500|$|We {{disliked the}} English {{language}} in the past. I disliked it because I was forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to learn it because of my age, and perhaps I would not be willing to do it because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in any way by flogging their idea of [...] "Hindi Imperialism" [...] to the maximum extent possible.

Davar gave the children certain cues and a general idea of what to do, but left the style and final product <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> avoid a choreographed appearance. Time constraints meant that while Khan was busy filming [...] "Bum Bum Bole," [...] Ram Madhvani took over as director for [...] "Bheja Kum". The latter sequence, containing a [...] "fun-filled" [...] song of rhythmic dialogue, allowed the audience to perceive how Ishaan sees the world and written languages. It was intended to represent [...] "a young boy's worst nightmare, in terms of... {{the worst thing that}} he can think of"; Madhvani based the visual concept on his son's fear of [...] "creepy-crawlies" [...] such as cockroaches, dragonflies, and lizards. Tata Elxsi's Visual Computing Labs made the creatures out of the English alphabet and numbers, although Khan insisted they include the Hindi alphabet as not all the audience would be familiar with English. The chalkboard writing's transformation into a snake was included to surprise the audience and [...] "end the song on a high note." ...|$|E

[...] Fellow Republican State Treasurer Mike Coffman refused to share the stage with Tancredo at a pro-war rally for the Iraq war in 2003 because of Tancredo's failure {{to serve in the}} Vietnam War. In 1970 Tancredo appealed his 1-A draft status, which would have put him {{at the top of the}} list for draft eligibility during the Vietnam War. Tancredo said he was diagnosed with depression when he was 16 or 17 and received medication for five years for panic attacks and bouts of anxiety and depression.|$|E

He nevertheless said discussions would continue with the other parties and also insisted, in reaction to suggestions that the UFC was divided, that Olympio supported his candidacy. Regarding the UFC's suspended participation in CENI, he said that the UFC representatives would return to the body because it would be preposterous to participate in the election while boycotting the electoral commission.|$|E
