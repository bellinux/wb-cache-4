40|$|An {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} anthropogenic {{sound in the}} ocean has generated international concern that it is affecting marine mammal behavior and could affect entire marine ecosystems as well. Presently {{there is a lack}} of a coherent policy framework for evaluating the environmental impacts of <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution.</b> No international treaties or laws specifically address the transmission of sound in waters under national jurisdiction or on the high seas. This dissertation examines the issue of <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> in a global context and considers the extent to which the international legal and environmental community has addressed it. ^ The sharp increase in ocean noise pollution is found to be a recent occurrence (within the last 100 years) resulting from the introduction of the internal combustion engine, sonar, and other technologies. Although a trend in increasing anthropogenic ocean noise is unsubstantiated, the intensity of noise in certain geographic areas is shown to have increased. Case studies are carried out on two such areas of intense acoustic activity, Stellwagen Bank and the Ligurian Sea. The important role of NGOs in raising awareness of <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> is demonstrated and the effects of noise are shown to be both environmental and political externalities. Underwater noise is shown to be a transboundary pollutant that mandates an international as opposed to a purely national, or unilateral, approach. The 1982 United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea is identified as the appropriate international legal framework with which to begin to address ocean noise. Air pollution policy, specifically the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, is adopted as a comparative framework for the evolution of ocean noise pollution policy. ^ Recommendations are made for the development of appropriate policy regarding the use of sound in the ocean including the adoption of an ecosystembased approach to ocean noise pollution that incorporates all sources of underwater sound. Finally, the establishment of marine protected areas and the use of ocean zoning are presented as optimal policy instruments to regulate ocean noise pollution. ...|$|E

In the last decade a few mass strandings of cetaceans due to sea trials of navy sonars (Frantzis (1998)), enforced the interest on <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> effects on marine mammals. The problem of evaluating the impact of <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> from ships is very complex due to the difficulties in characterising the whole noise chain (source, transmission path, receiver). Standards have been recently issued aimed at the measurement of <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> emitted from commercial ships.

40|$|On September 11, 2001 (“September 11 ”), {{a tragedy}} {{unfolded}} {{on the eastern}} seaboard of the United States that caused the sea to nearly empty of ships. This consequence of the terrible calamity in New York City opened {{an opportunity for a}} unique scientific study that may help to save the world’s whales. This rare experiment provides evidence that the undersea noise pollution generated by global commercial shipping slowly, chronically, and cumulatively cuts away at the lives of the great whales, including the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales, Eubalaena glacialis (“right whales”). The North Atlantic right whales are baleen whales that come each year to the productive waters of the Bay of Fundy, Canada to nurse their calves and forage for food. During the late summer of 2001, whale scientists from the New England Aquarium were studying the right whales in the Right Whale Conservation Area (“RWCA”) of the Bay of Fundy. The researchers were tracking hormonal changes in the whales, chiefly the hormones associated with stress. The scientists were watching for signs that the whales suffer from the effects of chronic stress, which could offer key information as to why the species has not recovered from its depletion by commercial whaling, despite strong legal and policy protections. The number of individuals in the North Atlantic right whale population is critically low, and the species remains endangered under both U. S. and international criteria. At {{the same time as the}} study above, other marine mammal scientists working on an unrelated project were also in the Bay of Fundy, monitoring the acoustic signals associated with the social behavior of the same right whales. This second group of researchers was looking for changes in the calls of the whales. Previous research had shown that high noise levels within the same low-frequency range that the great whales use to communicate causes the whales to raise the volume and frequency of their calls in order to be heard by others of their own species. The underlying scientific premise of both these studies is that <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> significantly interferes with the whales’ natural communication and behavior, and therefore could be inhibiting the recovery of their species. The noise generated by the propulsion systems on commercial shipping vessels is of particular concern. The ships generate loud low-frequency background noise that may mask communication among the whales, as well as hindering the whales’ ability to navigate on their long migrations and to detect predators and prey. As the world stood still after the tragic events of September 11, most shipping activities in U. S. waters were halted, causing the underwater noise level to drop dramatically. The vessel management system for the Bay of Fundy recorded a substantial decrease in traffic in the shipping lanes that pass within sixteen kilometers of the RWCA. On August 25, 2001, there were five vessels in the RWCA lanes and on August 29, four vessels. Comparatively, only one ship passed through the Bay of Fundy on September 12 and two on September 13. The unprecedented decrease in ship traffic gave scientists the extraordinary opportunity to compare the whales’ stress hormone levels before and after September 11, and to correlate the findings with the intensity level of underwater noise from ships during the same time periods. The investigators’ conclusions were two-fold: 1) there was a “noticeable” decrease in the low-frequency background noise of the type that would mask communication among the right whales; and 2) this drop in the background noise level showed a statistically significant relationship to the reduction in the stress hormones in the whales. This study demonstrated that the reduction in <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> from the shipping activities was directly related to a significant decrease in the stress levels of the whales. A large body of scientific literature shows that chronic stress, as measured by high levels of stress hormones, can lead to detrimental effects on health and reproduction across a variety of vertebrate groups, including mammals. If this is indeed the case with the North Atlantic right whales, reducing their stress hormone levels by reducing <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> from shipping might lead to increased health and reproductive success, which could lead to the recovery of their species. Underwater sound from all sources, including shipping, is measured by the intensity of the source level in decibels. The standard source level reference for underwater sound is “re __dB 1 Pa at 1 m,” with one micropascal (1 Pa) as the unit of intensity, the number of decibels (dB) as the unit of the sound level, and one meter (1 m) as the distance from the source, where the blank is completed by adding the number of decibels. Underwater sound is also described by its frequency in hertz (Hz). <b>Underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> from large ships is among the most pervasive of anthropogenic sounds in the ocean that falls within the lowfrequency range of 5 to 500 Hz that may mask the sounds produced and heard by the great whales. “Over the past few decades, the shipping contribution to ambient noise has increased by as much as 12 [decibels] coincident with a significant increase in the number and size of vessels comprising the world’s commercial shipping fleet. ” For comparison, a cargo vessel that is 173 meters long and sailing at 16 knots has a sound level of 192 dB, while a small boat outboard engine running at 20 knots has a sound level of 60 dB. <b>Underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> affects the mysticetes in many ways, some so subtle that they become apparent only when whale populations do not thrive, as in the case of the stress on the right whales. The adverse impacts are physical as demonstrated by the right whale study, and behavioral as documented extensively in the scientific literature. Most worrying of all are the hidden deaths of the whales that end their lives at sea due to the adverse impacts of long-term chronic stress or the whales that are killed by predators they could not detect due to masking. Those whales are never counted in the statistics of mysticete mortality from <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> because no human eyes witness the causes of their deaths. This paper aims to contribute to the interdisciplinary field of marine policy, integrating marine mammal science and international ocean law to support policy to conserve the great whales. The paper explores <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> from shipping as it affects the baleen whales and how the noise might be regulated to reduce the impacts. The first section discusses the use of sound by mysticetes, the impacts of <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> from shipping, and the existing treaties and organizations with the authority for international regulation of marine pollution in general and underwater noise in particular. The second section examines the dual “shipping-conservation” mission of the International Maritime Organization (“IMO” or “Organization”) and whether the current global legal framework is effective for protecting the great whales. The third section offers some suggestions for improving international regulation of shipping noise with the objective of reducing its impact on mysticetes. The analysis presented here addresses one small but important part of the wider group of issues regarding the intersection – and often, the conflict – between conservation of marine resources and the economically significant activities that may have adverse environmental impacts. The paper concludes that the IMO, which regulates discharges of pollution from commercial vessels, has the competence under international treaty law to regulate <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> from shipping and could issue guidelines for controlling the sources of shipping noise that impact the whales. While IMO regulation is one solution, this paper also briefly presents the possibility of a new global treaty to comprehensively address the impacts of <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> from all sources as it impacts not only the great whales but also other marine species and ecosystems...|$|E

Giant kelpfish exhibited acute stress responses when exposed to intermittent noise, but not to continuous noise or control conditions (playback of recorded natural ambient sound).

The most common anthropogenic noises in aquatic habitats derive from shipping. In the present study we investigated the implications of noise pollution from a ship on the sound detectability, namely of conspecific vocalizations in the Lusitanian toadfish, Halobatrachus didactylus. Ambient and ferry-boat noises were recorded in the Tagus River estuary (Portugal), as well as toadfish sounds, and their sound pressure levels determined. Hearing sensitivities were measured under quiet lab conditions and {{in the presence of}} these masking noises at levels encountered in the field, using the auditory evoked potentials (AEP) recording technique. The Lusitanian toadfish is a hearing generalist, with best hearing sensitivity at low frequencies between 50 and 200 ·Hz (below 100 ·dB re. 1 · Pa). Under ambient noise conditions, hearing was only slightly masked at lower frequencies. In the presence of ship noise, auditory thresholds increased considerably, by up to 36 ·dB, at most frequencies tested. This is mainly because the main energies of ferry-boat noise were within the most sensitive hearing range of this species. Comparisons between masked audiograms and sound spectra of the toadfish’s mating and agonistic vocalizations revealed that ship noise decreased the ability to detect conspecific acoustic signals. This study provides the first evidence that fishes’ auditory sensitivity can be impaired by ship noise and that acoustic communication, which is essential during agonistic encounters and mate attraction, might be restricted in coastal environments altered by human activity...|$|E

Over the years, several international disputes have resulted over damage that occurred when one State 2 ̆ 7 s pollutants crossed into another State 2 ̆ 7 s territory. The Trail Smelter case of 1941 is considered the landmark case of transboundary pollutant litigation. In this controversy, the United States claimed that damage was caused to the State of Washington by fumes from a smelter located seven miles from the international border in Canada. The U. S. initially rejected {{the decision of the}} International Joint Commission and the case was then referred to arbitration under a 1935 treaty. In March 1941, the United States was awarded the arbitral decision which asserted the principle that a State has responsibility for any environmental damage it creates even beyond its territorial limits. Specifically, the tribunal found that based on principles of international law: no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or person therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence. The Trail Smelter case underscored the fact that ecological effects know no boundaries; they can spill across geopolitical frontiers and cause cumulative externalities worldwide. Perhaps the most significant aspect of the Trail Smelter case was that it required States to do more than make reparation for environmental damage-it also recognized the duty of States to take appropriate measures to protect the environment. This case gave rise to the concept that even a sovereign nation owes surrounding States some protection from pollution which is created within its jurisdiction. The Trail Smelter case was unique in {{that it was one of}} the first cases to address an amorphous type of transboundary pollution. In fact, the Trail Smelter arbitration remains the only international adjudication on the subject of air pollution. At the time of the Trail Smelter controversy, scientists and legislators could not have anticipated the negative effects from the increasing presence of a similar, and seemingly innocuous type of pollutant-ocean noise. The effects from ocean noise are perhaps subtler and more insidious than the environmental effects of air pollution. These effects are unseen but can constitute an enormous threat to the marine ecosystem. Noise in the ocean is analogous to the smoke and noxious fumes of Trail Smelter in that it can also be considered a form of transboundary pollution. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) defines marine pollution as: the introduction by man, directly or indirectly, of substances or energy into the marine environment, including estuaries, which results or is likely to result in such deleterious effects as harm to living resources and marine life, hazards to human health, hindrance to marine activities, including fishing and other legitimate uses of the sea, impairment of quality for use of sea water and reduction of amenities. Because acoustic emissions involve the introduction of energy into the marine environment and may involve deleterious effects to marine mammals, noise can clearly be considered pollution under UNCLOS. The U. S. National Academy of Sciences has stated that 2 ̆ 2 [n]oise is widely acknowledged to be an environmental pollutant for humans and many other terrestrial species, and it is no doubt a pollutant for marine animals as well. 2 ̆ 2 Underwater sound is created by myriad activities worldwide. Whether it is created intentionally as in the use of sonar or as a by-product of another activity such as shipping, it is estimated that noise in the water has increased in magnitude between 1950 and 1975. The growing use of underwater acoustics for scientific research, defense applications, aquaculture, and seafloor mapping has greatly increased the quantity and intensity of sound in the ocean. This has given rise to issues that have not been addressed before. Environmental groups, biologists, and acousticians have raised concerns that man-made noise in the ocean could have adverse environmental effects on marine life. Specifically, it is believed that acoustic emissions affect the behavior of many species of marine mammals and could have effects on humans as well. Future regulation that restricts the use of sonar could have enormous impacts on naval operations, scientific research, oil exploration, fishing and aquaculture. Even unintentional emission of sound in the ocean created as a by-product of other activities such as shipping, recreational boating, and airplanes could be subject to regulation. Because underwater sound is capable of traveling long distances-thousands of miles-it can be considered a type of transboundary pollution. Presently there is a lack of a coherent policy framework for evaluating the environmental impacts of <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution.</b> There are no international treaties or laws that specifically address the operations of sonars or transmission of sound in territorial waters or the high seas. This paper examines the issue of <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> in a global context and identifies the capacity of international instruments to address it.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 Cook Inlet beluga whales (CIBs) are a {{geographically}} and genetically isolated population {{residing in}} Cook Inlet, Alaska year round. The population declined by approximately 50 % between 1994 and 1998 and {{was listed as}} endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 2008. The original decline was attributed to overharvest; however, the population has failed to rebound despite the virtual absence of harvest since 1998. This suggests that other factors, such as declining prey availability, increased predation, contaminants, disease, climate change, catastrophic events, habitat loss, unauthorized take, and <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution,</b> may be limiting the population's recovery. The goal of this dissertation research was to study the potential impacts of underwater noise on the CIB population. The objective of Chapter 1 was to study CIB acoustic behavior to gain {{a greater understanding of}} how CIBs utilize sound. The objective of Chapter 2 was to measure underwater sound levels in Cook Inlet to understand the background noise levels with which CIBs must cope. The objective of Chapter 3 was to document reactions of CIBs to noise disturbance utilizing local ecological knowledge to allow insight into the potential impacts of noise on beluga behavior. The results of Chapter 1 showed that belugas exhibit significant seasonal and spatial variation in calling behavior which suggested differences in habitat usage or differences in the surrounding environment, including background noise levels. The results of Chapter 2 showed that root mean square sound pressure levels exhibited high variation with the highest levels recorded in the 100 Hz frequency band. The seasonal differences in sound levels observed in this study were likely due to greater small vessel traffic and oil and gas development activities in the summer than the winter. In Chapter 3, participants reported observations of CIBs exhibiting avoidance reactions to noise sources including boats, planes, explosions, pile driving, construction, and cars. The results of this chapter showed that noise is perceived to alter beluga behavior and possibly beluga distribution in Cook Inlet. This dissertation research showed that underwater noise has the potential to affect CIBs, however the cost of this impact remains unclear and warrants further study. In light of the lack of support for many of the proposed factors limiting the population and the need for further research for many of these factors, it would be valuable to consider the cumulative effects of these multiple stressors. While their potential impact may be small individually, when combined, these factors may have a synergistic and significant impact on individual whales and, in turn, on the CIB population. Management of cumulative effects may be necessary to ensure the recovery of this endangered population...|$|E
