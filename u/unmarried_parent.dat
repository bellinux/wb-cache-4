40|$|This comment {{begins with}} the history of the {{conclusive}} presumption of paternity in California, from its common law roots to its modern day affirmation in Michael H. v. Gerald D. This background will discuss the adoption of the Uniform Parentage Act in California and its application in paternity proceedings. In an effort to advocate the need for its repeal, this comment will also discuss the modem trend in the California courts to circumvent the conclusive presumption. The comment concludes that this rebuttable presumption enables an unwed father to establish his parental rights regardless of the mother 2 ̆ 7 s marital status. By protecting developed parent-child relationships, California law has become more closely aligned with the Uniform Parentage Act, which aims to eliminate any differentiation between a married and an <b>unmarried</b> <b>parent</b> 2 ̆ 7 s legal relationship with the child. The courts have demonstrated the dwindling usefulness of the conclusive presumption in paternity disputes by placing greater importance on an assessment of the child 2 ̆ 7 s existing relationships...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{strengthening}} {{marriages and}} relationships in low-income families {{has emerged as}} a national policy strategy to enhance child well-being. Mathematica recently conducted a study of how programs and services to strengthen relationships in <b>unmarried</b> <b>parent</b> families can be developed, implemented, and evaluated. The study culminated in a Òconceptual frameworkÓ that identifies factors to consider in developing such programs, including the circumstances and needs of unwed parent families, program curricula, issues related to implementation and service delivery, and outcomes that should be affected. This brief focuses on the program design aspects of the conceptual framework. As a result of dramatic changes in family formation over the past several decades, American children are less likely today to be raised by both their parents. Although the majority of Americans embrace marriage as an ideal, one-third of all births in this country are to unmarried women, up from less than seven percent in the mid- 1960 s. Many postpone marriage or never marry, and a high proportion of married couples divorce. Cohabitation has become increasingly common, but cohabiting unions are generally less stable than marriage, and the children of these relationships are often raised by single mothers. The decline in marriage and the increase in nonmarital childbearing and childrearing have widespread and serious consequences for children, as well as for their parents, their communities, and society as...|$|E
40|$|Labor market {{outcomes}} {{of welfare reform}} {{have been the subject}} of extensive research by economists, but there has been relatively little work on living arrangements, which was an important focus of reformers. Our research fills that gap by using data from the March CPS to examine the impacts of 1990 s welfare waivers and the 1996 Federal welfare reform on living arrangements in samples of both children and women. Our findings suggest three main conclusions. First, welfare reform has had large effects on some important measures of living arrangements, including household size, parental co-residence among children, and marital status among women. Second, those effects are neither entirely aligned with the stated goals of reform nor entirely in spite of these goals. For example, in states that never had waivers, TANF was associated with a reduction of 14 percentage points in the fraction of Black children living in central cities who live with an <b>unmarried</b> <b>parent.</b> However, the fraction of these children living with neither parent rose by 8 percentage points, essentially doubling the baseline level. Third, there is a great deal of treatment heterogeneity both with respect to racial and ethnic groups, and with respect to whether reforms were waivers, TANF in states that had waivers, or TANF in states that did not (e. g., waiver effects on parental co-residence among Black, central-city children was much smaller than were TANF effects). Standard approaches - using only data on adult women, pooling the data across racial and ethnic groups, focusing only on high school dropouts, and/or assuming that TANF effects are the same in waiver and nonwaiver states - would generally not uncover these important changes in living arrangements. ...|$|E

40|$|The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Convention) protects {{parents with}} primary custody rights from parental {{abduction}} or retention {{of their children}} in another country. However, as more couples in the United States forgo marriage but continue having children, these couples-who often prefer informal parenting arrangements-do not often obtain court orders that identify their custody or visitation rights. Yet if an <b>unmarried</b> <b>parent</b> relocated to another country without the other parent 2 ̆ 7 s consent, the parties would {{have to rely on}} the state 2 ̆ 7 s default custody rules to determine where the custody battle should ensue. For example, Mexican jurisdictions follow a Roman civil law tradition, patria potestas (parental authority). From birth or voluntary acknowledgement of paternity, parental authority gives both parents the right to care and control their children and their children 2 ̆ 7 s property. However, in most United States jurisdictions, custody rights do not arise automatically simply because a child was born to unmarried parents. Instead, voluntary acknowledgment of paternity serves as a basis from which a parent can seek the court 2 ̆ 7 s determination of custody in the child 2 ̆ 7 s best interests. These differences in approaches to child custody appeared in two recent Convention cases in the Seventh Circuit. In both Garcia v. Pinelo and Martinez v. Cahue, the unmarried fathers voluntarily acknowledged paternity of their children. In Garcia, the Seventh Circuit found that the unmarried father, who resided in Mexico, had a right of custody under the Convention pursuant to the Mexican laws of parental authority. In contrast, in Martinez, the Seventh Circuit found that Illinois law presumes, {{in the absence of a}} court order, an unmarried mother has sole custody of her child. Therefore, the unmarried father in Martinez, who did not obtain a custody order before the mother moved to Mexico, did not have any rights of custody under the Convention, despite having acknowledged paternity. In light of demographic trends towards fewer marriages and more informal parenting arrangements, should jurisdictions like Illinois adopt child custody rules that endow rights of custody to both parents at birth or upon acknowledgement of the child? In order to protect children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests and to preserve the status quo before an alleged wrongful retention or abduction, Illinois should not adopt a rule like parental authority laws. While as a society we may want parents to share significant decision-making and to cooperate regarding their children 2 ̆ 7 s upbringing, default rules regarding children should protect children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests rather than parental rights. Illinois 2 ̆ 7 s presumption requires a court to consider the children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests before awarding custody and visitation rights while parental authority laws automatically confer decision-making authority to parents. Children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests are better served when a court protects stability and the status quo in children 2 ̆ 7 s lives rather than enabling a parent to assert parental rights for the first time under a Hague Convention petition...|$|E

40|$|Background : Previous {{research}} conducted in societies where unmarried cohabitation remains limited suggests that {{having grown up}} with <b>unmarried</b> <b>parents</b> fosters marital instability. There is little research on this relationship in societies where unmarried cohabitation has become common. Objective : We {{take advantage of the}} concurrent diffusion of unmarried cohabitation and union breakdown among French-speaking Quebeckers to examine whether family background (having grown up with <b>unmarried</b> <b>parents</b> and parental separation) and religion (reporting a denomination and religious attendance) have been key factors (intermediate variables) in the diffusion of conjugal instability or have been different consequences of a process of normative change unfolding across cohorts. Methods : We use a subsample of 2, 265 first unions from the 2011 Canadian General Social Survey. We estimate the hazard function and the effects of the independent variables on the hazard of breakdown using Royston‒Parmar flexible hazards models. Results : Results show that having grown up with <b>unmarried</b> <b>parents</b> has no effect on the hazard of breakdown despite the increasing proportion of respondents having lived in this form of family, whereas religious attendance does have an effect despite its decreasing importance. Parental separation increases the hazard of marital disruption for men but not for women. Contribution : Among French-speaking Quebeckers, the diffusion of unmarried cohabitation and of union breakdown seem to be two aspects of a profound shift in norms regarding family life rather than being related to each other in a direct causal way...|$|R

40|$|Fatherhood has {{traditionally}} been viewed {{as part of a}} “package deal” in which a father’s relationship with his child is contingent on his relationship with the mother. We evaluate the accuracy of this hypothesis in light of the high rates of multiple-partner fertility among <b>unmarried</b> <b>parents</b> using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a recent longitudinal survey of nonmarital births in large cities.

Mothers’ transitions into new romantic partnerships and new parenting roles are associated with larger declines in involvement than fathers’ transitions.

40|$|Family law {{is based}} on marriage, but family life {{increasingly}} is not. The American family is undergoing a seismic shift, with marriage rates steadily declining and more than four in ten children now born to <b>unmarried</b> <b>parents.</b> Children of <b>unmarried</b> <b>parents</b> fall far behind children of married parents {{on a variety of}} metrics, contributing to stark inequality among children. Poverty and related factors explain much of this differential, but new sociological evidence highlights family structure — particularly friction and dislocation between <b>unmarried</b> <b>parents</b> after their relationship ends — as a crucial part of the problem. As the trend toward nonmarital childbearing continues to spread across class lines, the effect will be most pronounced among children. This shift {{is the single most important}} issue facing family law today, yet scholars have been slow to engage with the structure and substance of the law in response. In family law, the marital family serves as a misleading synecdoche for all families, not only marginalizing nonmarital families, but also actively undermining their already tenuous bonds. It is essential for family law to address the needs of both marital and nonmarital families. This entails a new theory of state regulation as well as new doctrines, institutions, and norms in practice. Some feminists argue that the state should privilege caregiving between parents and children instead of marital relationships, while other commenters stubbornly advocate marriage primacy — the elevation of marriage above other family forms — despite all evidence that marriage promotion fails. These responses fundamentally misunderstand nonmarital family life, in which dynamics between parents deeply affect children yet marriage is not realistically returning. We must instead understand that it is possible to separate marriage from parenthood but not relationships from parenthood. The state must accordingly help <b>unmarried</b> <b>parents</b> become effective co-parents, especially after their relationship ends, so they can provide children with the healthy relationships crucial to child development. This theoretical insight, and the family law that flows from it, will inaugurate a larger debate about how to prepare for a world in which marriage is not the defining institution of family life...|$|R
