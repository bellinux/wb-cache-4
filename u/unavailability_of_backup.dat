40|$|In PT. Chevron Pacific Indonesia (PT. CPI), {{recloser}} is {{an important}} equipment for electric power systems that supposedly able to work optimally in a variety conditions probably happens on the systems. One {{of the causes of}} the losses incurred in PT. CPI is because of the recloser failure. Recloser failure is indeed a normal thing to happen, but the problem is when there is a failure (permanent damage) to the recloser which means that they must do the replacement, there is no backup available. This study aims to determine how often the recloser failure occur. So that, by knowing these things and from calculations carried out, will be obtained spare of recloser that must be available in a certain period. And by knowing the spare of recloser, the loss due to <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> <b>backup</b> recloser can be minimized and even eliminated...|$|E
40|$|Office {{building}} X has {{an area of}} 52 753 m 2 with {{a height}} of 120 m. As a multi-storey building, of course, office building X has {{a wide range of}} risk emergencies. This study aims to analyze the management of implementation on preparedness and emergency response in the office building X. This research is a descriptive qualitative in-depth interviews. The subject of this research consists of 5 person as the main informants and 3 person as the informant triangulation. The results showed that the management of office buildings X already have policies and commitments in terms of preparedness and emergency response. This is indicated by the emergency response procedures, the top management support such as funding and systemic policy, the emergency response organizations, the emergency communications, the emergency response infrastructure, the transportation of emergency response, the emergency response training, the emergency response simulation and evaluation of emergency response procedures. But the management of office buildings X doesn 2 ̆ 7 t have a program for hazard identification and risk assessment, the emergency response procedures is not contain of information about protection facilities and equipment available as well as the duties and responsibilities of emergency response organizations, there are tenants which has not obtain information related to emergency response procedures, procedure has not been set for the recovery of labor conditions or facilities that were damaged, the top management has not actively participate in simulated emergencies, emergency response organization is not consist of building occupants and building managers, <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> <b>backup</b> emergency vehicles, unavailability of stretcher and evacuation chair, assembly point which can not accommodate all the building occupants, the recapitulation process of building occupants were evacuated when simulating emergencies requires a long time. The management of office buildings X should complement existing emergency response procedures as well as reviewing other supporting facilities such as the support of top management, emergency response organizations, emergency response infrastructure, emergency response transportation and emergency response training...|$|E
40|$|Distribution system {{reliability}} assessment {{is an important}} part of distribution system operation and planning. This paper presents some approaches taken to minimize the SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index) for a remote distribution feeder in an 11 kV distribution system. Resulting from <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> alternative <b>backup</b> supplies from the other adjacent feeders, distributed generators (DG) can be used as backup supplies in this case. Coordinating distribution automation (DA) system with DGs, the restoration area can be made larger and the outage time can be shorter, consequently, the distribution {{system reliability}} can be improved significantly. In this paper, factors affecting SAIDI are discussed and methods including feeder reconfiguration, recloser installation and replacement and DG installation are applied to minimize SAIDI. Comparative studies are performed and related results are addressed...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{determining the}} quality of academic services at the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences of Madako University. This research uses the theory of service quality proposed by Zenthaml Parasuraman. Type of research is qualitative. The informants of this research consist leccturers, teaching staff, students and alumni who are determined purposively, with data collection methods consisted of observation, interviews and documentation. Data analysis techniques include data reduction, data verification and drawing conclusions. Research results indicate that {{the quality of}} academic services in the context of teaching and learning process in Faculty of Social and Political Sciences of Madako University is not qualified yet. This is evidenced by five dimensions used as a benchmark; barely four dimensions go well namely the dimensions of Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance and Empathy. While the dimension of tangible is inadequate therefore the academic services are not running properly. This is due to the <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> sufficient facilities that can support the lecturing process, such as <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> representative study room, <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> lecture rooms, <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> parking space, <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> worship facilities and library facilities that are not functioning...|$|R

40|$|Subject of Research. The {{processes}} of live migration without shared storage with pre-copy approach and move migration are researched. Migration of virtual machines {{is an important}} opportunity of virtualization technology. It enables applications to move transparently with their runtime environments between physical machines. Live migration becomes noticeable technology for efficient load balancing and optimizing the deployment of virtual machines to physical hosts in data centres. Before the advent of live migration, only network migration (the so-called, «Move»), has been used, that entails stopping the virtual machine execution while copying to another physical server, and, consequently, <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> the service. Method. Algorithms of live migration without shared storage with pre-copy approach and move migration of virtual machines are reviewed {{from the perspective of}} research of migration time and <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> services at migrating of virtual machines. Main Results. Analytical models are proposed predicting migration time of virtual machines and <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> services at migrating with such technologies as live migration with pre-copy approach without shared storage and move migration. In the latest works on the time assessment <b>of</b> <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> services and migration time using live migration without shared storage experimental results are described, that are applicable to draw general conclusions about the changes <b>of</b> time for <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> services and migration time, but not to predict their values. Practical Significance. The proposed models can be used for predicting the migration time and time <b>of</b> <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> services, for example, at implementation of preventive and emergency works on the physical nodes in data centres...|$|R
