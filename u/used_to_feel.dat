500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} held at Ravi Shankar's home in California, George Harrison {{referred to}} the reluctance he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> before visiting Shankar in India or meeting with A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the Hare Krishna movement, or more formally the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). This {{was due to the}} [...] "craziness" [...] taking place in his life, Harrison continued, which sat at odds with the spiritual goals represented by these friends. In January and February 1974, he visited India part-way through a period that he describes in his autobiography, I, Me, Mine (1980), as [...] "the naughty years", coinciding with the end of his marriage to Pattie Boyd. The visit led to Harrison writing two songs that would appear on his Dark Horse album later that year: [...] "It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)" [...] and [...] "Simply Shady". While the latter track reflected the singer's recent indulgences with drugs and alcohol, [...] "It Is 'He'" [...] documented what author Simon Leng terms [...] "a spiritual epiphany for Harrison" [...] in the Hindu holy city of Vrindavan.|$|E
500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} held at Shankar's home in California, Harrison {{spoke of}} the reluctance he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> before visiting India or meeting with friends such as A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada of the Hare Krishna movement, due to the [...] "craziness" [...] taking place in {{his life as a}} rock musician. Written during a period when his marriage to Pattie Boyd was ending, [...] "Simply Shady" [...] was inspired by the decadent lifestyle that Harrison had been leading at his Friar Park home in England. Over this period, he had immersed himself in his work, while returning to the worldly ways he had mostly abandoned in 1967, following his embrace of Indian philosophy, particularly meditation. Boyd has written of their overindulgence with drugs and alcohol over 1973–74 and highlighted Harrison's excessive use of cocaine, about which she says: [...] "I think it changed him... it froze George's emotions and hardened his heart." [...] In I, Me, Mine, Harrison describes the song as being [...] "about what happens to naughty boys in the music business". While recognising a disparity between its subject matter and his surroundings at the time, he says he most likely came up with the theme before leaving for India.|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1909, Rhodes scored 2,094 runs at {{an average}} of 40.26, which was to remain his second highest run {{aggregate}} and average for an English cricket season, and took 141 wickets. Sidney Rogerson believed that this season marked the completion of his transformation into a batsman. This view was supported by Wisden, which judged that he had [...] "now become such an exceptionally good batsman that the regret one <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> at his ever giving his mind to run getting has lost its force." [...] He played in four of the five Tests against Australia in 1909; [...] his omission from the second Test was later described as an error of judgement by the editor of Wisden, one of many selectorial blunders as England lost the series two games to one. Rhodes scored 168 runs {{at an average}} of 33.60, and took 11 wickets {{at an average of}} 22.00. In the first Test, he had a quiet time, scoring an unbeaten 15, batting at number eight, and bowling only one over. Recalled for the third Test, Rhodes bowled a spell in which four wickets were captured for seven runs, before being hit for four fours in one over by Trumper. His first innings figures were four for 38 and he took another two wickets for 44 runs in the second innings. In the fourth Test, Wisden believed that Rhodes alone bowled well on the second day, taking five for 83. Although moved up the order to bat at number five, he scored just five runs in the match. In the final Test, he batted at number three and scored two fifties, 66 and 54, adding 104 in the first innings with C. B. Fry and another 61 to save the game with the same batsman in the second.|$|E

2500|$|She had {{two films}} {{released}} in 1970: the Telugu film Amma Kosam and the Hindi film Sawan Bhadon, which was considered her acting debut in Bollywood. She {{had to learn}} Hindi, as that was not her naturally spoken language. Sawan Bhadon became a hit, and Rekha – a star overnight. Despite {{the success of the}} film, she was often scorned for her looks. She subsequently got several offers but nothing of substance, as her roles were mostly just of a glamour girl. She appeared in several commercially successful films at the time, including Raampur Ka Lakshman (1972), Kahani Kismat Ki (1973), and Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye (1974), yet she was not regarded for her acting abilities and—according to Tejaswini Ganti—"the industry was surprised by her success as her dark complexion, plump figure, and garish clothing contradicted the norms of beauty prevalent in the film industry and in society." [...] Rekha recalls that the way she was perceived at that time motivated her to change her appearance and improve her choice of roles: [...] "I was called the ‘Ugly Duckling’ of Hindi films because of my dark complexion and South Indian features. I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> deeply hurt when people compared me with the leading heroines of the time and said I was no match for them. I was determined to make it big on sheer merit." ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{species can}} grow to be 40-60 mm long, {{excluding}} the tail. They have six legs used for movement, two long, thin front legs that they <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> around for prey and detect vibrations, and two large pedipalps modified into claws that they <b>use</b> <b>to</b> crush their prey. They have a long, thin, whip-like tail, {{the origin of}} the common name whipscorpion. From the base of this tail they can spray a substance composed of 85% acetic acid in order to defend themselves. Acetic acid is the main component of vinegar, so the spray smells strongly of vinegar, leading to the common name [...] "vinegarroon".|$|R
50|$|The desman's body {{is covered}} in fur, with the {{exception}} of its tail and nose. Markings typical of the species are a brown body with a light coloured underside. The nose is black and {{is covered in}} whiskers, which it <b>uses</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the movement of prey as it sticks its nose into mud or crevices while searching for food. The Pyrenean desman can live at least 3.5 years. The animals are nocturnal hunters of small invertebrates, snails and shrimp. They breed up to three times a year, with the period of gestation lasting around thirty days. Three to four young are born in each litter.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering"December 2006. "The {{objective}} of this thesis is to design a system which can perform catheter insertion into a human body with haptic feedback. The haptic feedback will consist of a system; a surgeon can <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> forces in his hand while performing operation from a remote distance. The addition of touch sensor will enable the surgeon {{to know how much}} force is being applied to any tissues, and he will sense the same feeling as if working on the patient during the manipulation of the catheter. In this research scale model is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> simulate the catheter insertion operation. This research also demonstrates the effectiveness of MR fluid devices in force feedback applications. Force and displacement sensors sense the environment conditions along which the end effectors of electronic actuator moves. This information is then <b>used</b> <b>to</b> control the MR fluid device to provide appropriate force feedback to user. The research done and system created intended for future research benefiting the Wichita State University’s biomechanics program. Suggestions for future research are included.
