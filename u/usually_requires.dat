5|$|As of 2010, major long-standing {{extraction}} {{industries are}} operating in Estonia, Brazil, and China. Its economic viability <b>usually</b> <b>requires</b> {{a lack of}} locally available crude oil. National energy security issues have {{also played a role}} in its development. Critics of shale oil extraction pose questions about environmental management issues, such as waste disposal, extensive water use, waste water management, and air pollution.|$|E
5|$|Complicated UTIs {{are more}} {{difficult}} to treat and <b>usually</b> <b>requires</b> more aggressive evaluation, treatment and follow-up. It may require identifying and addressing the underlying complication. Increasing antibiotic resistance is causing concern about the future of treating those with complicated and recurrent UTI.|$|E
5|$|Earth <b>usually</b> <b>requires</b> {{some sort}} of {{processing}} for use in construction. It may be combined with water to make mud, straw may be added, some form of stabilizing material such as lime or cement {{may be used to}} harden the earth, and the earth may be compacted to increase strength.|$|E
50|$|The college offers over 15 {{certificate}} and diploma programs. Certificate programs <b>usually</b> <b>require</b> {{students to}} complete two semesters of courses, while diploma programs <b>usually</b> <b>require</b> four.|$|R

If [...] is equipped with a differentiable structure, then [...] is <b>usually</b> <b>required</b> to be differentiable. In these cases the flow forms a one parameter subgroup of homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms, respectively.|$|R

5|$|The {{array of}} a {{photovoltaic}} power system, or PV system, produces direct current (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. For practical use this <b>usually</b> <b>requires</b> conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current (AC), {{through the use}} of inverters. Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules. Modules are wired together to form arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency/phase.|$|E
5|$|To {{distinguish}} various subtypes, polysomnography is required. This <b>usually</b> <b>requires</b> brief {{admission to}} a hospital with a specialized sleep medicine department where {{a number of different}} measurements are conducted while the subject is asleep; this includes electroencephalography (electronic registration of electrical activity in the brain), electrocardiography (same for electrical activity in the heart), pulse oximetry (measurement of oxygen levels) and often other modalities. Blood tests are also recommended for the identification of hypothyroidism and polycythemia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} many diverse pathogens, {{many of which are}} {{constantly}} mutating, it is a surprise that a majority of individuals remain free of infections. Thus, maintenance of health requires the body to recognize all pathogens (antigens they present or produce) likely to exist. This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large (about 109) clones of B cells, each of which reacts against a specific epitope by recognizing and producing antibodies against it. However, at any given time very few clones actually remain receptive to their specific epitope. Thus, approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined. Moreover, in a lifetime, an individual <b>usually</b> <b>requires</b> the generation of antibodies against very few antigens in comparison with the number that the body can recognize and respond against.|$|E

5|$|Because White did {{not officially}} depart Minnesota {{until the middle}} of his second semester, he was academically ineligible to receive a {{scholarship}} from any Division I school in 2010. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) <b>usually</b> <b>requires</b> a two semester residency for transfers. He transferred to Iowa State prior to using any of his athletic eligibility at Minnesota and applied to the NCAA for a waiver to be eligible to play during the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, but the NCAA denied his waiver. Iowa State appealed the decision, but their appeal was denied.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} <b>usually</b> <b>requires</b> {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism is made on blood tests. Two types of blood tests {{are used to}} confirm {{the presence of a}} hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood samples are taken–usually in the morning–without any form of stimulation, and dynamic tests, where blood tests are taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone <b>usually</b> <b>requires</b> dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.|$|E

5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an abnormal result on a complete blood count. While an excess of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low {{white blood cell count}} (leukopenia). While a presumptive diagnosis of AML can be made by examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis <b>usually</b> <b>requires</b> an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency), folic acid deficiency and copper deficiency.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to level keys, every level has one Primagen Key. The six Primagen Keys unlock {{the gate to}} the final boss in the hub area and require the player to use talismans to collect them. Talismans grant Turok special powers, such as allowing him to jump long distances or walk over lava. To use the power of a talisman, the player must collect a feather in a level and then take it to the talisman chamber from that level. There are five talismans in the game and every level, except for the first one, features a feather and a talisman chamber. The Primagen key from one particular level <b>usually</b> <b>requires</b> the player to use the talisman from the next level, except for the Primagen key from the last level, which requires the player to use four talismans. Therefore, the player needs to re-enter some levels more than once to collect all Primagen keys and complete the game.|$|E
5|$|The lactational {{amenorrhea}} method {{involves the}} use of a woman's natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding. This <b>usually</b> <b>requires</b> the presence of no periods, exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and a child younger than six months. The World Health Organization states that if breastfeeding is the infant's only source of nutrition, the failure rate is 2% in the six months following delivery. Six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure rates at 6 months postpartum between 0% and 7.5%. Failure rates increase to 4–7% at one year and 13% at two years. Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a pacifier, and feeding solids all increase its failure rate. In those who are exclusively breastfeeding, about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months. In those who are not breastfeeding, fertility may return four weeks after delivery.|$|E

5|$|The {{specialized}} hardware of graphics processing units (GPU) {{is designed}} to accelerate rendering of 3-Dgraphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs {{are one of the}} most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and <b>usually</b> <b>requires</b> significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture. Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the open source OpenMM library, which uses a bridge design pattern with two application programming interface (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.|$|E
