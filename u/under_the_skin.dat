5|$|Tentative {{evidence}} supports neuroreflexotherapy (NRT), in which {{small pieces of}} metal are placed just <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> of the ear and back, for non-specific low back pain.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a nervous}} center {{is between the}} mouth and anus, and a nerve ring {{at the base of}} the lophophore. The ring {{supplies}} nerves to the tentacles and, just <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> to the body-wall muscles. Phoronis ovalis has two nerve trunks <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> whereas other species have one. The trunk(s) have giant axons (nerves that transmit signals very fast) which co-ordinate the retraction of the body when danger threatens.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{are given}} an {{injection}} of venom <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> in small amounts. During immunotherapy, the first dose is small, but will gradually increase per injection. This sort of immunotherapy {{is designed to}} change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.|$|E
25|$|White {{truffles}} {{are generally}} served raw, and shaved over steaming buttered pasta, salads, or fried eggs. White or black paper-thin truffle slices may be inserted into meats, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> of roasted fowl, in foie gras preparations, in pâtés, or in stuffings. Some speciality cheeses contain truffles, as well.|$|R
60|$|Not until Jacob {{was well}} outside the lodge did {{either of us}} three make any move to follow him, and then Sergeant Corney would have pushed me <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins,</b> which he raised slightly, but that I hung back, declaring it was Master Sitz's place to go first; {{but the old man}} forced me forward.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{an awful}} pity," [...] Godfrey said, {{as he looked at}} the great pile, [...] "that we haven't got {{anything}} we could use for holding the feathers. Well, we will have them picked anyhow. We can make a thick layer of them <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> for <b>the</b> present. When it gets downright cold we can nestle in among them somehow." ...|$|R
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is when gas or air is in {{the layer}} <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped air. It is sometimes abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue emphysema, or Sub Q air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where {{it is able to}} travel from the chest cavity along the fascia. Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a sensation that has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> is known as subcutaneous crepitation.|$|E
5|$|Air can {{be trapped}} <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> in necrotizing infections such as gangrene, {{occurring}} as a late sign in gas gangrene, {{of which it}} is the hallmark sign. Subcutaneous emphysema is also considered a hallmark of fournier gangrene. Symptoms of subcutaneous emphysema can result when infectious organisms produce gas by fermentation. When emphysema occurs due to infection, signs that the infection is systemic, i.e. that it has spread beyond the initial location, are also present.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is {{determined}} by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E
5000|$|Cantilevered: self-supporting. All the {{structure}} is buried <b>under</b> <b>the</b> aerodynamic <b>skin,</b> giving a clean appearance with low drag.|$|R
50|$|This phalloplasty {{procedure}} is {{the insertion of}} a subcutaneous soft silicone implant <b>under</b> <b>the</b> penile <b>skin.</b> <b>The</b> procedure was developed by urologist James J. Elist.|$|R
50|$|Foliage becomes wilted and discoloured. Leaves turn rusty red to scarlet {{with some}} yellowing. Rusty-brown tunnels are seen <b>under</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>skin</b> of mature roots.|$|R
5|$|Hemorrhagic {{smallpox}} is {{a severe}} form that {{is accompanied by}} extensive bleeding into the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. This form develops in approximately 2 percent of infections and occurred mostly in adults. In hemorrhagic smallpox the skin does not blister, but remains smooth. Instead, bleeding occurs <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> making it look charred and black, hence this form of the disease {{is also known as}} black pox.|$|E
5|$|Neuroblastoma (NB) {{is a type}} {{of cancer}} that forms in certain types of nerve tissue. It most {{frequently}} starts from one of the adrenal glands, but can also develop in the neck, chest, abdomen, or spine. Symptoms may include bone pain, a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest, or a painless bluish lump <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{even when}} blind, house sparrows {{continue}} to be photoperiodic, i.e. show reproductive development when the days are long, but not when the days are short. This response is stronger when the feathers {{on top of the}} head are plucked, and is eliminated when India ink is injected <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> {{at the top of the}} head, showing that the photoreceptors involved in the photoperiodic response to day length are located inside the brain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Under</b> <b>the</b> Same <b>Skin</b> (Bajo un mismo rostro) is a 1962 Argentine drama film {{directed}} by Daniel Tinayre. It was {{entered into the}} 12th Berlin International Film Festival.|$|R
60|$|Now she {{was within}} ten {{feet of the}} two unsuspecting little playfellows--carefully she drew her hind feet well up beneath her body, the great muscles rolling <b>under</b> <b>the</b> {{beautiful}} <b>skin.</b>|$|R
60|$|Although {{stricken}} with fear, when Helen saw the bronzed, massive shoulder, the long, powerful arm with its cords of muscles playing <b>under</b> <b>the</b> brown <b>skin,</b> {{she felt a}} thrill of admiration.|$|R
5|$|The {{early signs}} of AML are often vague and nonspecific, and may be {{similar to those of}} {{influenza}} or other common illnesses. Some generalized symptoms include fever, fatigue, weight loss or loss of appetite, shortness of breath, anemia, easy bruising or bleeding, petechiae (flat, pin-head sized spots <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> caused by bleeding), bone and joint pain, and persistent or frequent infections.|$|E
5|$|Wolves {{supplement}} their diet with {{fruit and vegetable}} matter. They willingly eat the berries of mountain ash, lily of the valley, bilberries, blueberries and cowberry. Other fruits include nightshade, apples and pears. They readily visit melon fields during the summer months. A well-fed wolf stores fat <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> around the heart, intestines, kidneys, and bone marrow, particularly during the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Johansson debuted on Broadway in {{a revival}} of A View from the Bridge, which won her a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress. Later that year, she began portraying Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She voiced an {{intelligent}} computer operating system in the 2013 comedy-drama Her, and played an alien in the 2013 science fiction film <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Skin,</b> {{as well as a}} woman with psychokinetic abilities in the 2014 science fiction action Lucy. The highest-grossing actress of 2016, she is also, as of May 2017, the highest-grossing actress of all time in North America.|$|E
50|$|Adult medflies {{lay their}} eggs <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> of fruit, {{particularly}} where <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> is already broken. The eggs hatch within three days, and the larvae develop inside the fruit. Maggots may stay from 5 to 10 days (depending on temperature and food availability by fruit size). Once the larvae reach the next development stage, it will dig {{its way out of}} the fruit, making a small hole and then falling to the ground where it starts to dig and then pupates centimeters underground. Depending on temperature adult emergence may occur in as short as 7 days. The adults have a limited ability to disperse, but the global fruit trade can transport infected fruit over thousands of miles.|$|R
50|$|Breast {{reconstruction}} surgery, for example, can {{use this}} technique when the mammary gland was removed by surgery (mastectomy). Later, a more permanent breast implant filled with saline or silicone gel is inserted <b>under</b> <b>the</b> expanded <b>skin</b> pocket.|$|R
50|$|The {{physician}} injector uses {{a sterile}} syringe, prepackaged with filler and a hypodermic needle (e.g. 27-G, 25 mm) to inject <b>the</b> material <b>under</b> <b>the</b> nasal <b>skin,</b> most commonly {{in the deep}} subcutaneous tissues, immediately above the periosteum.|$|R
5|$|On January 27, 2015, Lapierre {{was traded}} from the Blues to the Pittsburgh Penguins in {{exchange}} for Marcel Goc. Lapierre {{played a key role}} during the 2015 playoffs, getting <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> of the New York Rangers by drawing penalties, instigating fights, taunting and most notably doing play-by-play towards the Rangers' bench. He played an important role on the face-off dot and on the penalty kill, frustrating the New York Rangers and his former head coach in Vancouver, Alain Vigneault.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic {{protozoa}} of {{the genus}} Sarcocystis have been recovered from the smooth muscles of adult American white ibis, and another species, Haemoproteus plataleae, has been recovered from the blood of adults and nestlings, and can hence be transmitted before the young leave the nest. The larvae of two species of mite of the family Hypoderidae, Phalacrodectes whartoni and Neoattialges eudocimae, have been recovered from <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> Two species of the louse suborder Mallophaga, Plegadiphilus eudocimus and Ardeicola robusta, also parasitise the bird.|$|E
5|$|Some {{guidelines}} {{recommend a}} bolus (initial large dose) of insulin of 0.1unit of insulin per kilogram of body weight. This can be administered {{immediately after the}} potassium level {{is known to be}} higher than 3.3mmol/l; if the level is any lower, administering insulin could lead to a dangerously low potassium level (see below). Other guidelines recommend delaying the initiation of insulin until fluids have been administered. It is possible to use rapid acting insulin analogs injections <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> for mild or moderate cases.|$|E
50|$|Tarantula {{has been}} filmed by Spanish {{director}} Pedro Almodóvar, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> title <b>The</b> <b>Skin</b> I Live In, which was entered in competition in May 2011 for the Cannes Film Festival.|$|R
60|$|The apples {{proved to}} be delicious. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> tawny <b>skin</b> was a white, white flesh, faintly veined with red; and, besides their own proper apple taste, they had a certain wild, {{delightful}} tang no orchard-grown apple ever possessed.|$|R
50|$|When {{looked at}} <b>under</b> <b>the</b> microscope, <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> {{affected}} by dermatitis herpetiformis presents {{a collection of}} neutrophils. They have an increased prevalence in the areas where the dermis is closest to the epidermis.|$|R
5|$|The Japanese sleeper ray has {{an almost}} {{circular}} pectoral fin disc wider than long. Two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> {{on either side}} of the head. The small, protruding eyes are immediately followed by larger spiracles with prominently raised, smooth rims. The nostrils are small and placed close together, and between them is a curtain of skin that overlaps the mouth. The protrusible mouth forms a short, transverse line and is surrounded by a deep groove. There are fewer than 25 tooth rows in each jaw, arranged into bands; the teeth are small with oval bases and pointed crowns. Five pairs of short gill slits are located on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of DKA is with intravenous fluids and insulin. Depending on the severity, insulin {{may be given}} intravenously or by injection <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> Usually potassium is also needed to prevent the development of low blood potassium. Throughout treatment blood sugar and potassium levels should be regularly checked. Antibiotics may be required in those with an underlying infection. In those with severely low blood pH, sodium bicarbonate may be given; however, its use is of unclear benefit and typically not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Though {{this era}} in Galveston's history has not {{received}} {{a great deal of}} attention in popular culture (compared, for example, to Al Capone's Chicago), there has been some popular fiction and true crime story-telling centered on the era. Some notable examples include the novels <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Skin</b> by James Carlos Blake, No Greater Deception: A True Texas Story by Sydney Dotson, Galveston by Suzanne Morris, and Overlords by Matt Braun, as well as the anthology Lone Star Sleuths: An Anthology of Texas Crime Fiction by Bill Davis, et al. Galveston's Balinese Room was also the subject of a 1975 song by rock band ZZ Top.|$|E
50|$|The spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii, is {{a serious}} pest of blackberries. Unlike its vinegar fly {{relatives}} which are primarily attracted to rotting or fermented fruit, D. suzukii attacks fresh, ripe fruit by laying eggs <b>under</b> <b>the</b> soft <b>skin.</b> <b>The</b> larvae hatch and grow in the fruit, destroying the fruit's commercial value.|$|R
50|$|Genital beading (also {{known as}} yakuza beads, love beads or pearling) {{is a process}} in which beads or other small objects are {{implanted}} beneath <b>the</b> shaft <b>skin</b> of <b>the</b> penis,Genital ribs are short, slightly curved rods of various materials such as stainless steel, titanium, teflon, or silicone placed <b>under</b> <b>the</b> shaft <b>skin</b> of <b>the</b> penis.|$|R
40|$|A 48 -year-old male {{patient had}} an {{injection}} of industrial silicone <b>under</b> <b>the</b> penile <b>skin</b> for augmentation by non-medical practitio-ners a week before. There was complete necrosis of the dorsal part of <b>the</b> penile <b>skin</b> and soft tissue. In a penile magnetic resonance image, big masses of silicone <b>under</b> <b>the</b> penile <b>skin</b> were found {{and a part}} of the silicone was partially exposed. Debridement of the necrotic tissue was done. As {{the right side of the}} tunica albuginea was thin-walled, a silicone-induced infection developed. Because of this, the wet dressing was done daily without closing the wound for the next 23 days. Finally, both scrotal skins were drawn and sutured to <b>the</b> dorsal glandular <b>skin</b> after <b>the</b> total penile <b>skin</b> was completely removed and sutured with T-style anastomosis. The ventral flap was anastomosed to <b>the</b> ventral glandular <b>skin</b> with <b>the</b> end-to-end technique with inverted V incision at 1 cm proximal from the sutured margin. Flaps survived completely without skin necrosis or dehiscence...|$|R
