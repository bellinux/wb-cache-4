25|$|Historians {{have been}} using his diary to gain greater insight and {{understanding}} of life in London in the 17th century. Pepys wrote consistently on subjects such as personal finances, {{the time he got}} up in the morning, the weather, and what he ate. He talked at length about his new watch (which had an alarm, a new thing at the time) which he was very proud of, a country visitor who did not enjoy his time in London because he felt that it was too crowded, and his cat waking him <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> in the morning. Pepys's diary is one of the only known sources which provides such length in details of everyday life of an upper middle class man during the seventeenth century.|$|E
25|$|The show premiered as The Seinfeld Chronicles on July 5, 1989. After it aired, {{a pickup}} by NBC seemed {{unlikely}} {{and the show}} was offered to Fox, which declined to pick it up. Rick Ludwin, head of late night and special events for NBC, however, diverted money from his budget by canceling a Bob Hope television special, and the next 4 episodes were filmed. These episodes were highly rated as they followed summer re-runs of Cheers on Thursdays at 9:30p.m., and the series was finally picked <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>one</b> point NBC considered airing these episodes on Saturdays at 10:30p.m., but gave that slot to a short-lived sitcom called FM. The series was renamed Seinfeld after the failure of short-lived 1990 ABC series The Marshall Chronicles. After airing {{in the summer of}} 1990, NBC ordered thirteen more episodes. Larry David believed that he and Jerry Seinfeld had no more stories to tell, and advised Seinfeld to turn down the order, but Seinfeld agreed to the additional episodes. Season two was bumped off its scheduled premiere of January 16, 1991, due to the outbreak of the (Persian) Gulf War. It settled into a regular time slot on Wednesdays at 9:30p.m. and eventually flipped with veteran series Night Court to 9:00.|$|E

25|$|CMLL {{held their}} tribute to Rayo de Jalisco and Salvador Lutteroth after the ring was cleared from the Luchas de Apuetas match. Rayo de Jalisco Sr. {{came to the}} ring wearing his {{trademark}} lightingbolt mask and was accompanied by his son as well as Atlantis and Máscara Dorada for the ceremony. The fans showed their appreciation of the lucha libre legend by giving him a standing ovation as he was presented with a plaque commemorating the event. Atlantis and Máscara Dorada escorted the almost 80-year-old Rayo de Jalisco to the back while Rayo Jr. remained in the right for the fourth match of the night. Rayo Jr.'s partner Rush {{was introduced to the}} crowd, but before they could bring out Shocker Universo 2000 came through the crowd and attacked Rayo de Jalisco Jr. from behind. Moments later Shocker, Mr. Niebla and El Terrible all rushed to the ring and the opening portion of the match was chaos with all six wrestlers in the ring at the same time. The brawl saw the wrestlers pair off with their natural rivals, Shocker and Mr. Niebla, Rush and El Terrible and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Universo 2000. The rudo team took advantage of the confusion and cheated their way into winning the first fall. During the second fall Universo 2000 made a mistake, giving Rayo de Jalisco Jr. the opportunity to tie the match <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> fall each. During the third and final fall the 53-year-old Rayo de Jalisco Jr. actually leap off the top rope onto Universo 2000 on the floor. The third fall ended without a decisive victory as Universo 2000 decided to land a foul, low kick on Rayo de Jalisco Jr. drawing a disqualification from the referee.|$|E

Damage included houses that were completely removed from foundations and debris scattered for about , trees were debarked, and a few mobile homes were completely destroyed with debris strewn for about a mile downstream. Aerial surveys also revealed ground scouring in the area. EF5 damage was noted as a pickup truck was thrown hundreds of yards and torn into multiple pieces, and an [...] steel safe anchored to a foundation was torn away, thrown [...] and had its door torn from its hinges. One home in this area was swept away, and a stone pillar was ripped from the ground, thrown, and broken into pieces, with part of a concrete foundation being ripped {{out of the ground}} in the process. Other homes that were swept away were found with their concrete porches torn away and smashed to pieces. An underground storm shelter was partially sucked out of the ground, pavement was stripped from roads, and sidewalk pavement was pulled <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> location. In Sylvania, several other houses were completely removed from foundations, some of which contained anchor bolts and foundation straps.

2500|$|Intercepted Morse coded {{messages}} {{had been}} enciphered by the Germans’ Enigma, an electro-mechanical rotor cipher machine that implemented a polyalphabetic cipher. The main model {{in use in}} 1940 had three rotors that set an electrical pathway from the keyboard to the lampboard. Pressing a key caused one lamp to light and the right-most rotor to advance by one letter position. This changed the electrical pathway so that pressing the same key again caused a different letter to light <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>one</b> of the 26 positions, a notch on the right-most rotor engaged with the middle rotor so that the two rotors advanced together, and similarly the middle rotor would engage with the left-most rotor, giving a very long period before the sequence repeated (26 [...] 26 [...] 26 = 17,576). The ring on the rotor that contained the notch and so caused the next rotor to advance, could be set {{to any one of}} the 26 positions. The three rotors were selected from a set of five, giving 60 different ways of mounting rotors in the machine. However, because the Germans laid down the rule that no rotor should be in the same position on successive days, if the previous days's rotors and their positions were known, this number was reduced to 32.|$|E
2500|$|... "Like Welsh (sic)(1984, 1989), The Center induces rage by {{physically}} restraining {{the child}} and forcing eye contact with the therapist (the child must lie across the laps of two therapists, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> of them). In a workshop handout prepared by two therapists at The Center, the following sequence of events is described: (1) therapist 'forces control' by holding (which produces child 'rage'); (2) rage leads to child 'capitulation' to the therapist, {{as indicated by the}} child breaking down emotionally ('sobbing'); (3) the therapist takes advantage of the child's capitulation by showing nurturance and warmth; (4) this new trust allows the child to accept 'control' by the therapist and eventually the parent. According to The Center's treatment protocol, if the child 'shuts down' (i.e., refuses to comply), he or she may be threatened with detainment for the day at the clinic or forced placement in a temporary foster home; this is explained to the child as a consequence of not choosing to be a 'family boy or girl.' If the child is actually placed in foster care, the child is then required to 'earn the way back to therapy' and a chance to resume living with the adoptive family." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to the window and looked out over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996.

When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E
