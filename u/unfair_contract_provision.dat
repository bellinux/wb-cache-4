5000|$|As of May 2014, the UK Government has {{introduced}} proposed legislation before Parliament. The bill is the [...] "Consumer Rights Bill", {{and it will}} consolidate and develop <b>Unfair</b> <b>Contract</b> Terms <b>provisions</b> and Consumer Protection provisions.|$|R
40|$|The {{prohibition}} on <b>unfair</b> <b>contract</b> terms in standard form consumer contracts {{has the potential}} to significantly impact on the terms of contracts for the sale of land. The definition of ‘consumer contract’ includes contracts for the sale or grant of an interest in land to an individual wholly or predominantly for personal or domestic use. Therefore, a contract for the purchase of a residence for personal occupation by the buyer, as opposed to a purchase for investment purposes, will be a consumer contract potentially attracting the application of the unfair terms provisions. Significant consumer protection mechanisms already exist in most state jurisdictions requiring disclosure of relevant matters to the buyer and providing remedies for the provision of misleading conduct. Minimal evidence of unfair terms in land contract was presented to the Productivity Commission Inquiry into the Australian Consumer Policy Framework raising the question as to whether there is an identified problem of unfair terms in real estate contracts and if so, whether the same economic and ethical rationales justify regulatory intervention. This article examines what effect if any the introduction of the <b>unfair</b> <b>contract</b> <b>provisions</b> will have on the enforcement of residential land contracts and the viability of previously accepted conditions if challenged as being “unfair terms”. The article concludes that despite the existence of several potentially unfair terms in some land contracts, the intervention of the rules of equity to overcome perceived hardship or unfairness to buyers from strict enforcement of terms means the unfair terms provisions are only likely to operate on terms untouched by those principles. In the authors’ view the scope for operation of the unfair terms provisions will be limited to terms untouched by the principles of equity and consumer protection legislation making it unlikely that there will be any significant realignment of the contractual obligations and rights of buyers and sellers of land...|$|R
40|$|There are {{a number}} of ambiguities in the <b>unfair</b> <b>contract</b> terms <b>provisions</b> in Pt 2 - 3 of the Australian Consumer Law. The key {{concepts}} ‘consumer contract’, ‘standard form contract’ and ‘upfront price’ are not defined in an unequivocal manner. Part 2 - 3 obliges the court to consider a term’s transparency when determining its fairness, but fails to specify the precise requirement(s) of unfairness for which transparency is to be relevant. Part 2 - 3 fails to expressly address whether a term otherwise unfair may be rendered fair by a price reduction, whether an unfair term can be enforced {{to the extent to which}} it is fair, and whether the contra proferentem rule applies in the context of Pt 2 - 3. This article tackles the uncertainties mentioned and examines how the relevant provisions could be interpreted, considering their language, purpose and context. It also makes suggestions for clarifying amendments...|$|R
40|$|The “essential facilities” {{doctrine}} {{has been}} implemented in Australia through Parts IIIA and XIC of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth). Concurrently, {{the concept of}} an “essential service” in s. 600 F of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) limits the extent to which suppliers of critical services can cease supply to a business solely on the basis that a business has experienced an insolvency event. Contract clauses that permit termination of an agreement based solely on an insolvency event are often referred to as “ipso facto” clauses. The Productivity Commission has recommended that ipso facto clauses be made void. Part of the argument for the Productivity Commission’s view is that the presence of such clauses limits the prospect of an entity recovering from an insolvency event. The analysis by Treasury in its discussion paper on proposed amendments to the Corporations Act adopts the same line of reasoning. This article considers ipso facto clauses in the franchising sector. More than 60, 000 businesses in Australia operate under franchise agreements. The majority of these include an ipso facto clause {{for the benefit of the}} franchisor, but not the franchisee. We consider the effect of making ipso facto clauses void in contracts between franchisees and franchisors in the context of both the essential facilities doctrine and the anti-deprivation rule. We use a doctrinal analysis in the context of a contract based on an unequal power relationship, where the value of the contract may mean that the recently extended <b>unfair</b> <b>contract</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Australian Consumer Law may not apply. The analysis leads to a series of recommendations to address the power asymmetry in the relationship between franchisors and franchisees in the context of franchisor insolvency...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{will consider}} the new <b>unfair</b> <b>contract</b> terms <b>provisions</b> outlined in the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). The ACL {{is part of the}} Competition and Consumer Law Act 2010 (Cth) that commenced in 2 stages - on 1 July 2010 and 1 January 2011. The ACL has now provided a statutory framework regarding the effect of unfair terms within a broad range of consumer contracts – including property contracts. It departs significantly from the classical contract theory and moves toward statutory and judicial intervention in assessing the fairness of <b>contract</b> terms. An <b>unfair</b> term in a standard form consumer contract will be void. This presentation {{will consider the}} likely impact of the ACL on property transactions on property contracts that fall within the definition of a 2 ̆ 7 consumer contract 2 ̆ 7. The presentation will also examine the classification principles of an 2 ̆ 7 unfair term 2 ̆ 7 {{for the purposes of the}} ACL and suggest some measures to minimise the risk of breaching the ACL...|$|R
