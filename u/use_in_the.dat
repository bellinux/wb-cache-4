5|$|A {{supply of}} 929 M249 SAWs was issued to {{personnel}} from the U.S. Army and Marine Corps during the Persian Gulf War. Although exposure to combat was scarce, M249 gunners {{who were involved}} in fighting mainly used their weapons to provide cover fire for friendly maneuvering troops from fixed positions, rather than maneuvering with them. There were many complaints about the weapons clogging up with sand after prolonged <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert environment.|$|E
5|$|Although the s were a {{significant}} improvement from the preceding , especially with the 3,000-ton displacement increase, they were outclassed by {{the advent of the}} dreadnought well before they were completed.
