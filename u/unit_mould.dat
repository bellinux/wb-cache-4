50|$|Although both wooden {{and steel}} moulds {{can be used}} to {{construct}} the Xbloc formwork, steel moulds are preferred as they can be used repetitively to produce large numbers of armour <b>units.</b> Various <b>mould</b> designs, consisting of 2 sections, are applied. The moulds are either vertically or horizontally assembled. Pouring and compaction of concrete is done simultaneously. An appropriate formwork design is facilitating the stripping of the moulds at an early stage and prevents to large extent from honey combing, surface bubbles and striking damages.|$|R

25|$|Black Mountain Sandstone is {{deposited}} {{on top of}} State Circle Shale conformably. It is made up from thick beds of grey quartz sandstone mostly, but has some beds included of siltstone and grey shale. The grain size is fine to medium. It was originally named by Öpik after the mountain—Black Mountain where it is found. Originally it {{was believed to be}} Ordovician, but is actually from the Silurian period, late Llandoverian epoch. Some of the slopes of Black mountain are covered in fanglomerate. The deposition was in a marine proximal turbidite fan, with the turbidity current flowing to the east. There are no fossils, but there is some sedimentary structure including plane, cross or convolute laminations, load casts, slump <b>units</b> and flute <b>moulds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both {{products}} are an officially SAP Certified Solution since the 25th of November of year 2009. MyWorkPLAN and WorkPLAN Enterprise can receive jobs or task lists from the SAP ERP or other ERP systems, detailing parts and quantities of components to be produced. WorkPLAN then manages the manufacturing process, including the production planning and scheduling, production performance monitoring, and recording {{the time spent}} on each task by each employee or machine in real time, using touchscreens, barcode readers or data-entry forms. As production proceeds, data can be fed back into SAP {{in the form of}} time taken, events completed and parts produced. Detail such as set-up times, processing times, teardown times, quantities completed, reworked or scrapped can be included in the information flow. Real-time recording of this information in WorkPLAN helps keep the SAP system up to date, producing a dynamic exchange of data, and safeguards the business information, so when it is presented to managers, it reflects the true and current status of manufacture. Companies using SAP solutions at a corporate level can benefit from this integration, which enables to optimise the performance of specialised areas within the organization, such as engineering departments or manufacturing <b>units</b> of <b>moulds,</b> dies or prototypes.|$|R
40|$|Lomolding is a piston {{moulding}} process, {{similar to}} injection moulding in some respects, aimed at making thermoplastic parts. A {{life cycle cost}} model is being developed to optimise lomolding machine designs and to investigate the range of products suitable for profitable application of lomolding. Several machine layout concepts were generated and evaluated to optimise the lomolder life cycle cost. This paper describes the concepts that were evaluated, why the final concept was chosen and ends with an outline of a parametric model that can be manipulated to generate different sized machines of the final concept. The key elements focussed on are the metering- and <b>moulding</b> <b>unit</b> assemblies, {{as well as the}} runner system between them. The material plasticiser and clamp unit are excluded since they are similar to those found on injection moulding machines. The parametric model is the starting point for estimating the contribution to the life cycle costs of the machine's purchase and operating costs and the energy consumption...|$|R
40|$|Compressed air {{is one of}} {{the major}} sources of energy {{consumption}} and also one of the most expensive types of energy. Consequently, special attention must be paid to its rational use. This is especially important in cases where compressed air is blowed into an "empty" space. All cleaning and cooling processes using compressed air are typical examples of such applications. They are the most wasteful consumers of compressed air. Measures to minimize air consumption in such cases are presented in the paper. The highly efficient cooling <b>unit</b> for plastic <b>moulding</b> machines has been designed and optimized based on CFD simulation, and then produced using RP/RM (Rapid Prototyping / Manufacturing) manufacturing technology. The developed and specially designed nozzle-system was used for cooling purposes during plastic canister manufacturing. The previously-used conventional cooling system had so far been recognized as the most wasteful compressed air consumer in the company. The newly-designed air-efficient cooling unit, with increased capacity for cooling air, allows for up to 50 % energy savings regarding compressed air...|$|R
40|$|Multistage, steel-sheet, {{centrifugal}} pumps require shapes {{that differ from}} those commonly featured by cast or <b>moulded</b> <b>units.</b> The available literature on pumps design deals mainly with the latter and does not support satisfactorily the hydraulic design of the former. The availability of experimental data is scarce as well. On the other hand, validated CFD models {{proved to be an}} effective design tool. The paper deals with the numerical investigation of a vertical multistage pump. It aims at presenting a CFD modelling approach that is computationally low-cost and suited for the early and intermediate steps of hydraulic design of mass production pumps. A single passage of one intermediate stage was modelled by using the Multiple Reference Frame technique and the Arbitrary Matching Interface approach within the open source OpenFOAM ® environment. The influence of the multistage configuration on numerical predictions was accounted analytically. Standard k-epsilon model and wall function approach were used for turbulence closure. This modelling strategy was validated by comparison of the calculated hydraulic performance, efficiency and power consumption with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{project is}} {{focusing}} {{on the development of}} a test unit for the hydraulically driven clamping system, typically used in injection moulding. The objectives of this project are to fabricate the model of clamping unit and to perform structural analysis based on the model design through simulation and by performing actual experiment on the real fabricated model. This actual test was conducted by compressing the load cell in between the two moulds halves {{in order to get the}} clamping force value through the data logger. The results obtained from simulation shows that the maximum stress of clamping unit with tie bar can achieve up to 11. 2 MPa, with the safety value of 2. 5. In the other hand, for the actual test experiment, the result the maximum clamping force produce is 3160 N at 52 bar of pressure. These values are important to be used as guidance in selecting the suitable injector part. As a conclusion, this clamping system has work properly and efficiently to be used for further research and a tool to understand more about the mechanism and the effects of clamping <b>units</b> in injection <b>moulding</b> process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the mould, which is made from mild steel and aluminium, and the effect of these moulds properties towards the quality of thermoplastics part. As for this research, two different types of mould material were fabricated by using Computer Numerical Controller (CNC) milling machine. These moulds were specifically design to produce a test sample which was an integral hinge made from Polypropylene. These moulds were tested practically by using Nissei-NP 7 - 1 F injection <b>moulding</b> <b>unit.</b> A set of parameter setting consisting of melt temperature, packaging pressure, injection time, packing time and mould temperature had been chosen to acquire the correlation between the mould materials and the part’s quality. Five tested samples were prepared for evaluation in terms of the material consumption, warpage, and shrinkage values. Results have been observed and analysed and it was found that in term of material consumption value, aluminium mould consumed 1. 28 gram or 14 % more polypropylene than mild steel. For warpage value, mild steel mould had the lowest value with only 0. 08 mm warpage. The third experiment showed that the lowest shrinkage was happened to be 0. 01302, which was produced by mild steel mould. As the conclusion in this project, mild steel mould was selected as the desirable mould for producing integral hinges samples as compare with the aluminium mould...|$|R
40|$|Composites of {{high density}} {{polyethylene}} (HDPE) and carbon fibre (C fibre) were compounded and moulded into tensile test bars in compounding injection moulding (CIM) equipment that combines a twin-screw extruder and an injection <b>moulding</b> <b>unit.</b> Two HDPE grades exhibiting different rheological behaviours were used as matrices. The mechanical properties of the moulded parts were assessed by both tensile and impact tests. The respective morphologies were characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the semicrystalline structures of the matrices investigated by X-ray diffraction. The final fibre length distribution and fibre orientation profiles along the part thickness were also quantified. The composites with lower viscosity exhibit higher stiffness, higher strength and superior impact performance. Both composites exhibit a three layer laminated morphology, featuring two shell zones and a core region. Interfacial interaction is favoured by a lower melt viscosity that enhances the wetting of the fibre surfaces and promotes mechanical interlocking. The composites display a bimodal fibre length distribution that accounts for significant fibre length degradation upon processing. The dimensions of the transversely orientated core differ for the two composites, which is attributed to the dissimilar pseudoplastic behaviour of the two HDPE grades and the different thermal levels of the compounds during injection moulding. Further improvements in mechanical performance are expected through the optimisation of the processing conditions, tailoring of the rheological behaviour of the compound {{and the use of}} more adequate mould design...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess the changes of content of essential organic nutrients, yeasts and moulds and effect of aerobic fermentation when the fresh (untreated) and treated brewers grains (BG) is stored in the stall conditions. Both the fresh brewers grains from Radegast brewery and that treated by mixture of sodium benzoate (22. 9 %) sodium propionate (8. 3 %) and following 90 days anaerobic fermentation were mounded in the entrance of stall and tested in two tests, one during the winter period in February, the other one during the summer period in June. Influence of treatment was evident on the process of fermentation, levels of the nitrogen-free extract substances (NFES) and number of forming colony <b>units</b> (FCU) of <b>moulds</b> in the winter period. The fermentation activities in both tested masses were documented, however the decrease of intent of NFES in treated variants was highly conclusive (P < 0. 01) lower than that of untreated variants. Stagnation of increase of formol titration in treated BG matches the same tendency. Significant (P < 0. 01) limitation of mould growth was noted at treated BG, the number of FCU of moulds stagnated since 1 st to 5 th to day of testing. On the other hand the number of FCU of moulds in untreated BG was redoubled after 4 days since the start of testing. Treatment influenced monitored parameters above all in the early gout after the start of tes­ting. NFES content in untreated BG in February statistically highly conclusive (P < 0. 01) fell from ave­rage values 502. 99 ± 8. 704 in 1 st day of testing on 437. 533 ± 18. 877 g .  kg dry matter in 6 th day of testing while at treated BG was fall behind the same period only conclusive (P < 0. 05). There was ascertained highly conclusive growth (P < 0. 01) of level of formol titration from 0. 004 ± 0. 001 in 1 st day to 0. 178 ± 0. 038 in 6 th day of the same testing at untreated BG, while the level of formol titration stagnated at treated BG. In June content of NFES at untreated BG statistically conclusive (P < 0. 05) declined from 455. 578 ± 9. 515 in 1 st day on 432. 92 ± 9. 515 g .  kg dry mater in 5 th day of testing. Near NFES content at treated BG statistically conclusive (P < 0. 05) declined as late as 7 th day. Alike formol titration level at untreated BG surged from 0. 008 ± 0. 001 in 1 st day on 0. 087 ± 0. 036 in 5 th day, on the contrary at treated BG come to statistically highly conclusive (P < 0. 01) growth as late as 7 th day of testing. Both monitoring demonstrate that the treatment of BG by mixture of sodium benzoate (22. 9 %) and sodium propionate (8. 3 %) and its subsequent 90 day anaerobic fermentation will reduce activity of moulds and fall of included NFES and retarded resolution of protein on subsequent manipulation up deliver form silage bag and during a short-period storage in stall...|$|R
