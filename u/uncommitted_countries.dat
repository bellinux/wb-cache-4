Leading the debate for the (Conservative) Opposition in November 1968 Jellicoe said: We hold that a grave constitutional change of this kind should not be brought into effect in the dying years of a discredited Government ... a viable Upper House has an essential part to play in our parliamentary structure. We now have a quite considerable constitutional prize in our grasp, the opportunity to build a really viable Upper House {{on the basis of a}} broad consensus of support from all Parties ...

40|$|Unilateral climate policy {{suffers from}} carbon leakage, i. e. the (partial) offset {{of the initial}} {{emission}} reduction by increases in other countries. Different than most typically discussed climate policies, degrowth not only aims at reducing the fossil fuel use in an economy, but rather at a reduction of all factor inputs, which may lead to different leakage implications. We conduct the first investigation of degrowth in a multi-country setting in order to (i) compare the leakage effects of national pure emission reduction policies to degrowth scenarios, (ii) identify underlying channels by decomposing the implied emission changes into scale, composition, and technique effects, and (iii) investigate which country characteristics determine degrowth 2 ̆ 019 s relative effectiveness to overcome the leakage problem. Using a structural gravity model, we find that degrowth indeed significantly reduces leakage by keeping the sectoral composition of the country more stable and reducing <b>uncommitted</b> <b>countries</b> 2 ̆ 019 incentives to shift towards more energy-intensive production techniques. The higher effectiveness of degrowth in reducing carbon emissions is most pronounced for small and trade-open economies with comparatively clean production technologies...|$|E
50|$|Heroes may {{accompany}} troop stacks or {{split off}} on their own, moving up to six regions per turn. If a hero moves to an <b>uncommitted</b> <b>country,</b> he may engage in diplomacy by rolling a die and comparing the result to his home country's diplomacy rating. On a sufficiently high roll, the <b>uncommitted</b> <b>country</b> becomes an ally. Heroes can also recruit mercenaries by moving to a special mercenary recruitment area, then drawing a Mercenary Card. If the Mercenary Card's alignment {{is compatible with the}} hero, the player acquires the card and may use it to improve his chances in combat. Finally, heroes may search for treasure in regions designated as magic areas. Before he acquires a treasure, the hero must draw a Treasure Card and battle the indicated guardian monster. A single die-roll resolves the battle. A high roll means the hero triumphs, and the player adds one or more Treasure Cards to his hand.|$|R
50|$|The {{larger problem}} was that by 1979, {{combined}} ZIRPA and ZANLA strength inside Rhodesia totalled at least 12,500 guerrillas and {{it was evident that}} insurgents were entering the country at a faster rate than the Rhodesian forces could kill or capture. In addition, 22,000 ZIPRA and 16,000 ZANLA fighters remained <b>uncommitted</b> outside the <b>country.</b> Joshua Nkomo's ZIPRA forces were preparing their forces in Zambia with the intent of confronting the Rhodesians through a conventional invasion. Whether such an invasion could have been successful in the short term against the well trained Rhodesian army and air force is questionable. However, what was clear was that the insurgency was growing in strength daily and the ability of the security forces to continue to control the entire country was coming under serious challenge.|$|R
