5|$|Keating {{motivated}} Tonelli {{by showing}} {{him the best}} times recorded by American boys of the same age, as documented in Swimming World Magazine. Unaware that the Americans were swimming in 50yd pools, roughly 10% shorter than those in Australia, Tonelli could not <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> inability to match and better their times. He said that his greatest motivation was the desire to impress his parents.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1955, Steiger {{played an}} obnoxious film tycoon, {{loosely based on}} Columbia boss Harry Cohn, {{opposite}} Jack Palance and Ida Lupino in Robert Aldrich's film noir The Big Knife. Steiger bleached his hair for the part, sought inspiration for the role from Russian actor Vladimir Sokoloff, read {{a book about the}} Treblinka extermination camp to <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> character thoroughly, and visited the perfume department of a store in Beverly Hills, California, to try to <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> character's contempt for women. Steiger and Palance did not get along during the production, and in one scene Palance threw several record albums at Steiger in frustration, feeling {{that he was trying to}} steal the scene. Steiger earned critical acclaim later that year for a role as a prosecuting major in Otto Preminger's The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, alongside Gary Cooper and Charles Bickford.|$|E

5|$|Berkman {{stayed in}} jail for two months {{awaiting}} his trial. He had one hour per day of exercise with other prisoners. They could not <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> motive for the attack on Frick. Surely {{it must have been}} a personal dispute or a business quarrel. His explanations were met with condescending smiles. One fellow prisoner, a Homestead worker who was about to stand trial for throwing dynamite at the Pinkertons, told him the workers did not believe in violence. Berkman had no connection with Homestead, and the strike was none of his business. He had only hurt the workers' cause with his action.|$|E
5|$|Siva is Nagarjuna's 17th film as an actor. Varma {{found him}} the only actor who could <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> perspective. Nagarjuna and Varma had {{discussed}} astronomy and realised that they shared similar sensibilities. That, and Varma's passion for and dedication to films, prompted Nagarjuna {{to work with}} him. Amala, who worked with Nagarjuna in Prema Yuddham (1990), {{was chosen as the}} female lead. Siva was the first film in her career where the script was explained shot by shot. When Varma approached Rohini to dub Amala's portions, she agreed to dub for Amala only after watching about three reels of footage.|$|E

5|$|Ørsted did {{not fully}} <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> discovery, but he {{observed}} the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents {{in the same direction}} are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere.|$|E
5|$|After an {{examination}} in May 1723, Murray was accepted into Christ Church, Oxford, having scored {{higher in the}} examination than any other King's Scholar that year. He was admitted as a commoner on 15 June 1723, and matriculated on 18 June; the records say that he came from Bath rather than Perth, because the person recording {{the names of the}} new students was unable to <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> Scottish accent. His older brother James was a barrister in Scotland, and his family decided that a career as a barrister was best for Murray. The Scottish Bar at the time was overcrowded, which made it difficult for a young barrister to build a reputation, yet qualifying for the English Bar was extremely expensive. Thanks to the patronage of Thomas Foley, 1st Baron Foley, who gave Murray £200 a year to live on, Murray could afford to study at the bar, and became a member of Lincoln's Inn on 23 April 1724.|$|E
5|$|Annoyed by Peter's {{constant}} shocking, Brian professes his discomfort by referencing {{his anger}} after O. J. Simpson {{was acquitted of}} charges in the O. J. Simpson murder case. After Lois expresses her hope for the restaurant to be successful, Stewie sarcastically states {{that it will be}} just as successful as Liza Minnelli's Playboy photoshoot. Returning home from the restaurant, Peter and Lois decide to watch an episode of Maude, but the length of the opening theme song causes Peter to become fatigued by the show. Once the restaurant begins hemorrhaging money, Peter decides to shoot a commercial parodying M. Night Shyamalan's 1999 film The Sixth Sense. After Joe's handicapped friends take over the restaurant, Peter expresses his discomfort about the restaurant's coolness to Lois by retrieving a picture of American actor Mark Harmon and showing it to Lois in an attempt to make her <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> concern.|$|E

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the War of the First Coalition, Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. Unfortunately for him, military rations were insufficient to satisfy his appetite. He would carry out tasks for other soldiers in return for a share of their rations and scavenge on the dungheap for scraps, but this was not enough to satisfy him. Suffering from extreme exhaustion, he was admitted to the military hospital at Soultz-Haut-Rhin. He was granted quadruple rations but remained hungry; he would scavenge for garbage in gutters and refuse containers, eat the scraps of food left by other patients, and creep into the apothecary's room to eat the poultices. Military surgeons could not <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> appetite; Tarrare was ordered to remain in the military hospital to take part in physiological experiments designed by Dr.Courville (surgeon to the 9th Hussar Regiment) and George Didier, Baron Percy, surgeon-in-chief of the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Pam apologizes to Jim that Roy {{attacked}} him but her assurance that {{her relationship with}} Roy is over for good is met with polite skepticism. Roy picks up his last paycheck, apologizes to Jim for threatening him during their previous encounter, and asks Pam to join him for coffee. Their meeting at a local diner is awkward and ends with their relationship (and even friendship) appearing to be over; they hug and Pam wipes a tear from her face. Roy encourages Pam to pursue her feelings for Jim {{but she says she}} will not try to get him. Roy does not <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> long-time fiancée, especially her choice to not pursue Jim.|$|E

5|$|Parsifal {{wonders if}} the Garden is a dream and asks {{how it is that}} Kundry knows his name. Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother (""), who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father's fate, the mother he had {{abandoned}} and who had finally died of grief. She reveals many parts of Parsifal's history to him and he is stricken with remorse, blaming himself for his mother's death. He thinks himself very stupid to have forgotten her. Kundry says this realization is a first sign of understanding and that, with a kiss, she can help him <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> mother's love. As they kiss Parsifal suddenly recoils in pain and cries out Amfortas' name: he feels the wounded king's pain burning in his own side and now understands Amfortas' passion during the Grail Ceremony (""). Filled with this compassion, Parsifal rejects Kundry's advances.|$|E

A more creative scientist <b>understands</b> <b>his</b> science in very many ways, and can more easily create new theories, new ways of understanding, when the 'current paradigm' no longer fits the current data".|$|R
