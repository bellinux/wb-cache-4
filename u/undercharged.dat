6000|$|... [FN#1] When travelling, the Shushah {{is allowed}} to spread over the {{greatest}} portion of the scalp, {{to act as a}} protection against the sun; and the hair being shaved off about two inches all round the head, leaves a large circular patch. Nothing can be uglier than such tonsure, and it is contrary to the strict law of the Apostle, who ordered a clean shave, or a general growth of the hair. The Arab, however, knows by experience, that though habitual exposure of the scalp to a burning sun may harden the skull, it seldom fails to damage its precious contents. He, therefore, wears a Shushah during his wanderings, and removes it on his return home. Abu Hanifah, if I am rightly informed, wrote a treatise advocating the growth of a long lock of hair on the Nasiyah, or crown of the head, lest the decapitated Moslem's mouth or beard be exposed to defilement by an impure hand. This would justify the comparing it to the [...] "chivalry-lock," [...] by which the American brave facilitates the removal of his own scalp. But I am at a loss to discover the origin of our old idea, that the [...] "angel of death will, on the last day, bear all true believers, by this important tuft of hair on the crown, to Paradise." [...] Probably this office has been attributed to the Shushah by the ignorance of the West. [FN#2] [...] "Makhi-chus," [...] equivalent to our [...] "skin-flint." [...] [FN#3] A well-known Arab chieftain, whose name has come to stand for generosity itself. [FN#4] This being an indispensable instrument for measuring distances, I had it divested of gold case, and provided with a facing carefully stained and figured with Arabic numerals. In countries where few can judge of a watch by its works, it is as well to secure its safety by making the exterior look as mean as possible. The watches worn by respectable people in Al-Hijaz are almost a1ways old silver pieces, of the turnip shape, with hunting cases and an outer etui of thick leather. Mostly they are of Swiss or German manufacture, and they find their way into Arabia via Constantinople and Cairo. [FN#5] On my return to Cairo, Omar Effendi, whom I met accidentally in the streets, related the story to me. I never owned having played a part, to avoid shocking his prejudices; and though he must have suspected me,-for the general report was, that an Englishman, disguised as a Persian, had performed the pilgrimage, measured the country, and sketched the buildings,-he had the gentlemanly feeling never to allude to the past. We parted, when I went to India, on the best of terms. [FN#6] Munkati'a-one cut off (from the pleasures and comforts of life). In Al-Hijaz, as in England, any allusion to poverty is highly offensive. [FN#7] The Koran expressly forbids a Moslem to discredit the word of any man who professes his belief in the Saving Faith. The greatest offence of the Wahhabis is their habit of designating all Moslems that belong to any but their own sect by the opprobrious name of Kafirs or infidels. This, however, is only the Koranic precept; in practice a much less trustful spirit prevails. [FN#8] Towards the end of the season, poor pilgrims are forwarded gratis, by order of government. But, to make such liberality as inexpensive as possible, the Pasha compels ship-owners to carry one pilgrim per 9 ardebs (about 5 bushels each), in small, and 1 per 11 in large vessels. [FN#9] I was informed by a Prussian gentleman, holding an official appointment under His Highness the Pasha, at Cairo, that 300,000 ardebs of grain were annually exported from Kusayr to Jeddah. The rest is brought down the Nile for consumption in Lower Egypt, and export to Europe. [FN#10] The account here offered to the reader was kindly supplied to me by Henry Levick, Esq. (late Vice-Consul, and afterwards Post-master at Suez), and it may be depended upon, as coming from a resident of 16 years' standing. All the passages marked with inverted commas are extracts from a letter with which that gentleman favoured me. The information is obsolete now, but it may be interesting as a specimen of the things that were. [FN#11] The rate of freight is at present (1853) about forty shillings per ton-very near the same paid by the P. and O. Company for coals carried from Newcastle via the Cape to Suez. Were the [...] "Farzah" [...] abolished, freight to Jeddah would speedily fall to 15 or 16 shillings per ton. Passengers from Suez to Jeddah are sometimes charged as much as 6 or even 8 dollars for standing room-personal baggage forming another pretext for extortion-and the higher orders of pilgrims, occupying {{a small portion of the}} cabin, pay about 12 dollars. These first and second class fares would speedily be reduced, by abolishing protection, to 3 and 6 dollars. Note to Second Edition.-The [...] "Farzah," [...] I may here observe, has been abolished by Sa'id Pasha since the publication of these lines: the effects of [...] "free trade" [...] are exactly what were predicted by Mr. Levick. [FN#12] The principal trade from Suez is to Jeddah, Kusayr supplying Yambu'. The latter place, however, imports from Suez wheat, beans, cheese, biscuit, and other provisions for return pilgrims. [FN#13] My friends were strenuous in their exertions for me to make interest with Mr. West. In the first place, we should have paid less for the whole of a privileged vessel, than we did for our wretched quarters on the deck of the pilgrim-ship; and, secondly, we might have touched at any port we pleased, so as to do a little business in the way of commerce. [FN#14] Afterwards called by Sir R. F. Burton the [...] "Golden Wire."-ED. [FN#15] For the [...] "Sath," [...] or poop, the sum paid by each was seven Riyals. I was, therefore, notably cheated by Sa'ad the Demon. The unhappy women in the [...] "Kamrah," [...] or cabin, bought suffocation at the rate of 6 dollars each, as I was afterwards informed, and the third class, in the [...] "Taht," [...] or amidships and forward, contributed from 3 to 5 Riyals. But, as usua1 on these occasions, there was no prix fixe; every man was either overcharged or <b>undercharged,</b> according to his means or his necessities. We had to purchase our own water, but the ship was to supply us with fuel for cooking. We paid nothing extra for luggage, and we carried an old Maghrabi woman gratis for good luck. [FN#16] We were still at Suez, where we could do as we pleased. But respectable Arabs in their own country, unlike Egyptians, are seldom to be seen in the places of public resort. [...] "Go to the coffee-house and sing there!" [...] is a reproach sometimes addressed to those who have a habit of humming in decent society. [FN#17] It was only my prestige as physician that persuaded my friend to join me in these bathings. As a general rule, the Western Arabs avoid cold water, from a belief that it causes fever. When Mr. C. Cole, H.B.M.'s Vice-Consul, arrived at Jeddah, the people of the place, seeing that he kept up his Indian habits, advised him strongly to drop them. He refused; but unhappily he soon caught a fever, which confirmed them all in their belief. When Arabs wish to cool the skin after a journey, they wash with a kind of fuller's earth called [...] "Tafl," [...] or with a thin paste of henna, and then anoint the body with oil or butter. [FN#18] An incrementative form of the name [...] "Fatimah," [...] very common in Egypt. Fatimah would mean a [...] "weaner"-Fattumah, a [...] "great weaner." [...] By the same barbarism Khadijah becomes [...] "Khaddugah"; Aminah, [...] "Ammunah"; and Nafisah, [...] "Naffusah," [...] on the banks of the Nile. [FN#19] The palmy days of the Egyptian husband, when he might use the stick, the sword, or the sack with impunity, are, in civilised places at least, now gone by. The wife has only to complain to the Kazi, or to the governor, and she is certain of redress. This is right in the abstract, but in practice it acts badly. The fair sex is so unruly in this country, that strong measures are necessary to coerce it, and in the arts of deceit men have here little or no chance against women. [FN#20] The amount of settlement being, among Moslems as among Christians, the test of a bride's value,-moral and physical,-it will readily be understood that our demand was more facetious than complimentary. [FN#21] The term Misriyah (an Egyptian woman) means in Al-Hijaz and the countries about it, a depraved character. Even the men own unwillingly to being Egyptians, for the free-born never forget that the banks of the Nile have for centuries been ruled by the slaves of slaves. [...] "He shall be called an Egyptian," [...] is a denunciation which has been strikingly fulfilled, though the country be no longer the [...] "basest of kingdoms." [...] [FN#22] In those days merchants depended solely upon the native trade and the passage of pilgrims. The pecuniary advantage attending what is called the Overland transit benefits chiefly the lowest orders, camel-men, sailors, porters, and others of the same class. Sixteen years ago the hire of a boat from the harbour to the roadstead was a piastre and a half: now it is at least five. [FN#23] This word, says Mansfield Parkyns (Life in Abyssinia), is applied to the wandering pilgrim from Darfur, Dar Borghu, Bayarimah, Fellatah, and Western Africa. He mentions, however, a tribe called [...] "Tokrouri," [...] settled in Abyssinia near Nimr's country, but he does not appear to know that the ancient Arab settlement in Western Africa, [...] "Al-Takrur," [...] (Sakatu?) which has handed down its name to a large posterity of small kingdoms, will be found in Al-Idrisi (1. climate, 1. section,); but I do not agree with the learned translator in writing the word [...] "Tokrour." [...] Burckhardt often alludes in his benevolent way to the [...] "respectable and industrious Tekrourys." [...] I shall have occasion to mention them at a future time. [FN#24] The Sudan (Blackland) in Arabia is applied to Upper Nubia, Senaar, Kordofan, and the parts adjacent. [FN#25] Not only in Ghiz, but also in Arabic, the mother of Ghiz, the word [...] "Habash," [...] whence our [...] "Abyssinians," [...] means a rabble, a mixture of people. Abyssinian Moslems are called by the Arabs [...] "Jabarti." [...] [FN#26] There is no such thing as a tree, except the date, the tamarisk, and the mimosa on the western shores of the Red Sea. [FN#27] This word, which in Arabic is the feminine form of [...] "Baghl," [...] a mule, is in Egypt, as in India, pronounced and written by foreigners [...] "buggalow." [...] Some worthy Anglo-Indians have further corrupted it to [...] "bungalow." [...] [FN#28] [...] "The ardeb, like most measures in this country of commercial confusion, varies greatly according to the grain for which it is used. As a general rule, it may be assumed at 300 lbs." [...] [FN#29] Return Arab boats, at any but the pilgrim season, with little difficulty obtain permission to carry passengers, but not cargo. Two gentlemen, in whose pleasant society I once travelled from Cairo to Suez,-M. Charles Didier and the Abbe Hamilton,-paid the small sum of 1000 piastres, (say L10) for the whole of a moderate sized [...] "Sambuk" [...] returning to Jeddah. [FN#30] Mother-of-pearl is taken to Jerusalem, and there made into chaplets, saints' figures, and crucifixes for Christian pilgrims. At Meccah it is worked into rosaries for the Hajis. In Europe, cabinet and ornamental work cause a considerable demand for it. Some good pearls are procurable in the Red Sea. I have seen a drop of fair size and colour sold for seven dollars. [FN#31] I was told at Meccah that the pilgrimage is attended by about 2000 natives of Java and the adjoining islands. [FN#32] The following popular puerilities will serve to show how fond barbarians are of explaining the natural by the supernatural. The Moslems of Egypt thus account for the absence of St. Swithin from their drought-stricken lands. When Jacob lost his Benjamin, he cursed the land of Misraim, declaring that it should know no rain; Joseph on the other hand blessed it, asserting that it should never want water. So the Sind Hindus believe that Hiranyakasipu, the demon-tyrant of Multan, finding Magha-Raja (the Cloud King) troublesome in his dominions, bound him with chains, and only released him upon his oath not to trouble the Unhappy Valley with his presence. I would suggest to those Egyptian travellers who believe that the fall of rain has been materially increased at Cairo of late, by plantations of trees, to turn over the volumes of their predecesors; they will find almost every one complaining of the discomforts of rain. In Sind it appears certain that during the last few years there has been at times almost a monsoon; this novel phenomenon the natives attribute to the presence of their conquerors, concerning whom it cannot be said that they have wooded the country to any extent. [FN#33] This may appear a large mortality; but at Alexandria it is said the population is renewed every fourteen years. [FN#34] During these North winds the sandy bar is exposed, and allows men to cross, which may explain the passage of the Israelites, for those who do not believe the Legend to be a Myth. Similarly at Jeddah, the bars are covered during the South and bare during the North winds. [FN#35] This mixture, called in India Kichhri, has become common in Al-Hijaz as well as at Suez. [...] "Al-Kajari" [...] is the corruption, which denotes its foreign origin, and renders its name pronounceable to Arabs. [FN#36] Beans, an abomination to the ancient Egyptians, who were forbidden even to sow them, may now be called the common [...] "kitchen" [...] of the country. The Badawin, ho believe in nothing but flesh, milk, and dates, deride the bean-eaters, but they do not consider the food so disgusting as onions. [FN#37] Here concludes Mr. Levick's letter. For the following observations, I alone am answerable. [FN#38] The government takes care to prevent bloodshed in the towns by disarming the country people, and by positively forbidding the carrying of weapons. Moreover, with a wise severity, it punishes all parties concerned in a quarrel, where blood is drawn, with a heavy fine and the bastinado de rigueur. Hence it is never safe, except as a European, to strike a man, and the Egyptians generally confine themselves to collaring and pushing each other against the walls. Even in the case of receiving gross abuse, you cannot notice it as you would elsewhere. You must take two witnesses,-respectable men,-and prove the offence before the Zabit, who alone can punish the offender. [FN#39] NOTE TO THIRD (1873) EDITION.-I revisited Suez in September, 1869, and found it altered for the better. The population had risen from 6,000 to 20,000. The tumble-down gateway was still there, but of the old houses-including the [...] "George Inn," [...] whose front had been repaired-I recognised only four, and they looked mean by the side of the fine new buildings. In a few years ancient Suez will be no more. The bazars are not so full of filth and flies, now that pilgrims pass straight through and hardly even encamp. The sweet water Canal renders a Hammam possible; coffee is no longer hot saltish water, and presently irrigation will cover with fields and gardens the desert plain extending to the feet of Jabal Atakah. The noble works of the Canal Maritime, which should in justice be called the [...] "Lesseps Canal," [...] shall soon transform Clysma into a modern and civilised city. The railway station, close to the hotel, the new British hospital, the noisy Greek casino, the Frankish shops, the puffing steamers, and the ringing of morning bells, gave me a novel impression. Even the climate has been changed by filling up the Timsch Lakes. Briefly, the hat is now at home in Suez. NOTE TO FOURTH (1879) EDITION.-The forecast in the last paragraph has not been fulfilled. I again visited Suez in 1877-78; and found that it had been ruined by the Canal leaving it out of line. In fact, another Suez is growing up about the [...] "New Docks," [...] while the old town is falling to pieces. For this and other Egyptian matters, see [...] "The Gold Mines of Midian" [...] (by Sir Richard Burton).|$|E

5000|$|The first telecom {{spectrum}} {{auction in}} India {{was held in}} 1994. Auctions were held again in 1997, 2000, and 2001. Spectrum in the 900MHz band was auctioned in all these years except 2001, while 1800 MHz band spectrum was auctioned {{for the first time}} in 2001.Following the 2001 auction, the government abandoned the practice of auctions in favour of an administrative allocation model. Under this model, the government would select companies that it deemed were best equipped to develop India's telecom infrastructure. The final allocation of 900 MHz took place in 2004, through the new model. This policy resulted in spectrum being allocated at far lower prices than had been done through auctions. For example, Reliance had paid 12.25 crore and 58.49 crore in 1995 for 4.4MHz spectrum in West Bengal and Orissa respectively. In 2004, Airtel was allocated the same amount of spectrum in the same circles for 1 crore and 4.4 crore respectively.In 2008, 122 new 2G UAS licenses were granted to telecom companies on a first-come, first-served basis at the 2001 price.

40|$|This study empirically {{examines}} {{the impact of}} mandatory audit fee disclosure on price competition in the audit market. We expect fiercer price competition between auditors after the public disclosure of audit fees because transparency about audit fee information {{is likely to increase}} client bargaining power and/or decrease the incumbent auditor’s bargaining power. Using a dataset including both pre- and post-disclosure audit fees we find that during a period from three years before and three years after mandatory disclosure, audit fees generally increase. However as from the year where audit fee disclosure is mandatory overcharged (<b>undercharged)</b> clients experience a downward (upward) fee adjustment. In addition, <b>undercharged</b> clients are able to mitigate the upward fee adjustment if they have higher bargaining power and/or have an auditor who faces stronger competitive pressure, i. e. lower auditor bargaining power. These effects in favor of the under- and overcharged clients are largest in the initial disclosure year suggesting anticipatory price adjusting behavior by audit firms. Additional analysis suggests that - irrespective of client and auditor bargaining power - as from disclosure onwards overcharged clients are better off switching auditors to obtain a more favorable fee, whereas <b>undercharged</b> clients are better off reappointing their auditor. status: accepte...|$|E

According to their salt-rate profiles, unstable multifunctional supramolecules with permanent internal charges show highest membrane sensitivity, and the dependence of membrane sensitivity on the acidity of internal cations exceeds that on supramolecule stability. These results can, with all appropriate caution, be interpreted as indications for the existence of long-range EMP-ICR interactions (EMP: external membrane pressure, ICR: internal charge repulsion) between membrane hosts and functional guests that can, for instance, prevent the 'explosion' and promote the 'implosion' of over- and <b>undercharged</b> transmembrane barrel-stave supramolecules, respectively...|$|E
40|$|It is very {{important}} {{to have the ability to}} determine the available capacity, the state of charge (SoC), and the state of health (SoH) of a battery; this ensures that the battery has the available power for the system requirements. A battery is aged by charging and discharging cycles; this process degrades the chemical composition of the battery. An <b>undercharged</b> battery has sulphation and stratification effects that shorten the lifetime of the battery. Overcharging causes gassing and water loss. This paper describes a novel two-pulse test to determine the AHC, SoC, and SoH of a valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) and a lithium ion battery. These parameters are related to the voltage drop after each pulse of current discharge. The first pulse stabilizes the battery relative to its previous history, and the second pulse establishes the parameters.

40|$|Provision {{of energy}} to {{wireless}} sensor networks is crucial for their sustainable operation. Sensor nodes are typically equipped with batteries as their operating energy sources. However, when the sensor nodes are sited in almost inaccessible locations, replacing their batteries incurs high maintenance cost. Under such conditions, wireless charging of sensor nodes by a mobile charger with an antenna can be an efficient solution. When charging distributed sensor nodes, a directional antenna, rather than an omnidirectional antenna, is more energy-efficient because of smaller proportion of off-target radiation. In addition, for densely distributed sensor nodes, it can be more effective for some <b>undercharged</b> sensor nodes to harvest energy from neighboring overcharged sensor nodes than from the remote mobile charger, because this reduces the pathloss of charging signal due to smaller distances. In this paper, we propose a hybrid charging scheme that combines charging by a mobile charger with a directional antenna, and energy trading, e. g., transferring and harvesting, between neighboring sensor nodes. The proposed scheme is compared with other charging scheme. Simulations demonstrate that the hybrid charging scheme with a directional antenna achieves {{a significant reduction in}} the total charging time required for all sensor nodes to reach a target energy level...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{importance}} of ion-induced nucleation {{in the lower}} atmosphere has been discussed for a long time. In this article we describe a new instrumental setup – Ion-DMPS – {{which can be used}} to detect contribution of ion-induced nucleation on atmospheric new particle formation events. The device measures positively and negatively charged particles with and without a bipolar charger. The ratio between “charger off ” to “charger on ” describes the charging state of aerosol particle population with respect to equilibrium. Values above one represent more charges than in an equilibrium (overcharged state), and values below unity stand for <b>undercharged</b> situation, when there is less charges in the particles than in the equilibrium. We performed several laboratory experiments to test the operation of the instrument. After the laboratory tests, we used the device to observe particle size distributions during atmospheric new particle formation in a boreal forest.

40|$|We {{consider}} what an economically efficient federal transportation policy {{would look like}} if carbon emissions from motor fuel consumption were priced through a carbon tax. We focus on two broad issues: the role for other policies aimed at fuel conservation, and implications for infrastructure finance. We find that motor fuels in the United States would still be <b>undercharged</b> {{from the perspective of}} reflecting externalities (notably congestion, accidents, and local pollution), so that a fuel tax remains justified. Better, however, would be a mileage-based tax because that comes closer to reflecting these externalities; better still would be one that varies with congestion, emissions of local pollutants, or potential for a vehicle to inflict damage on others in a collision. The case for fuel efficiency standards relies primarily on the strength of and reasons for consumer undervaluation of fuel efficiency when making vehicle purchase decisions. The portion of a carbon tax levied on motor vehicle fuels could {{go a long way toward}} covering current and growing shortfalls in highway funding, although they would not be eliminated so a case for a fuel tax remains. A mileage tax would provide a more stable fiscal base than a fuel tax, as well as improving the control of externalities. Key Message...|$|E

We {{show that the}} classification into overcharged (implying some participation of ion-induced nucleation) and <b>undercharged</b> (implying no or very little participation of ion-induced nucleation) days, based on Ion-DMPS measurements, agrees with the fraction of ion-induced nucleation based on NAIS measurements. Those classes {{are based on the}} ratio of ambient charged particle to steady-state charged particle concentration, known as the charging state. We analyzed the influence of different parameters on the contribution of ion-induced nucleation to the total particle formation rate. We found that the fraction of ion-induced nucleation is typically higher on warmer, drier and sunnier days compared to colder days with less solar radiation and a higher relative humidity. Also, we observed that bigger concentrations of new particles were produced on days with a smaller fraction of ion-induced nucleation. Moreover, sulfuric acid saturation ratios were smaller for days with a bigger fraction of ion-induced nucleation. Finally, we propose explanations on how these different parameters could influence neutral and ion-induced nucleation, and show that the different mechanisms seem to take {{place at the same time}} during an event. For example, we propose that these observed differences could be due to high temperature and low vapors' saturation ratios (water and sulfuric acid) increasing the height of the energy barrier a particle has to reach before it can grow and thus limiting neutral nucleation...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{refrigerant}} CO 2 {{is widely}} used in refrigeration and heat pump systems. It is of great significance for reductions of ozone depletion and global warming. The efficiency of heat pump system is affected by many factors. The amount of refrigerant charge in the heat pump is a primary parameter that influences the energy efficiency. Undercharge or overcharge of refrigerant degrade its performance and deteriorate system reliability. Therefore, heat pump should be charged with an optimum amount of refrigerant to achieve high performance. However, {{it is difficult to}} calculate the optimum charge accurately because of the various components and operating parameters. Â In this paper, a trans-critical CO 2 Â heat pump system is set up to investigate the influence of refrigerant charge on the performance of a small-sized heat pump water heater. The trans-critical CO 2 Â heat pump system is composed of a rotary compressor, a tube-in-tube evaporator and gas cooler, an electronic expansion valve (EEV), and an internal heat exchanger (IHX). The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the characteristics of the CO 2 heat pump under various refrigerant charging conditions. Therefore, the performance of the CO 2 Â system was measured and discussed on the basis of refrigerant charge amount. Â Based on the experimental results, the effects of refrigerant charge on the power of system, rejection pressure, evaporating pressure, mass flow rate and coefficient of performance (COP) were analyzed with different EEV openings. The experimental results show that the COP was strongly related to CO 2 mass charge and that the formation of the trans-critical cycle depended on CO 2 mass charge greatly. The pressures in the gas cooler and the evaporator increased with the rise of refrigerant charge. The compression ratio decreased with the increase of the refrigerant charge. The COP has a maximum value at a specific CO 2 mass charge. <b>Undercharged</b> CO 2 systems could result in a fast decrease of the heating capacity and COP. However, overcharged CO 2 systems could cause an abrupt increase of compressor power consumption. The heating cycle displayed different characteristics with different CO 2 mass charges. The optimum CO 2 mass charges varied with different EEV openings, and it could be determined according to several parameters...|$|E

Charge levels ranged from 30 % <b>undercharged</b> to 40 % overcharged for the short-tube orifice unit. For the thermal expansion valve (TXV) unit, charge levels ranged from- 36 % charging to + 27 % charging. Performance was quantified with the following variables: total capacity, energy efficiency ratio (EER), and power. The performance of the orifice unit was more sensitive to charge than it was for the TXV unit. For the TXV unit on the - 27 % to + 27 % charging range, the capacity and EER changed little with charge. A TXV unit and a short-tube orifice unit were also tested for reduced evaporator airflow. As evaporator airflow decreased, the capacity and EER both decreased as expected. However, the drop was not as significant as with the charging tests. For the extreme case of 50 % reduced evaporator airflow, neither unit's capacity or EER dropped more than 25 %. Return air leakage from hot attic spaces was simulated by assuming adiabatic mixing of the indoor air at normal conditions with the attic air at high temperatures. Effective capacity and EER both decreased with increased return air leakage. However, power consumption was relatively constant for all variables except outdoor temperature, which meant that for the same power consumption, the unit delivered much lower performance when there was return air leakage. The increase in sensible heat ratio (SHR) with increasing leakage showed perhaps the most detrimental effect of return air leakage on performance, which was the inability of the unit to absorb moisture from the environment...|$|E
