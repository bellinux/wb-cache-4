The vocals are by Moira Lambert, as Sarah Cracknell had not yet joined the band as a permanent member. The band recorded the song in producer Ian Catt's bedroom studio in Pollards Hill. The recording, made in under two hours, got them a record deal, their first single, and their first hit. Andrew Weatherall later remixed the song, further emphasising its dub bassline: this remix, subtitled [...] "A Mix of Two Halves" [...] (duration 8:49), was featured on both releases of the single and on the compilation Casino Classics. The U.S. and European releases contained a different extended mix by Flowered <b>Up</b> (<b>duration</b> 6:19), issued in the UK only on a flexidisc, though it was mistakenly listed as the [...] "Mix of Two Halves". Weatherall had no involvement with this mix.|$|E

Using a reduced order model, parametric {{solutions for the}} optimal air-fuel ratio, valve timing, cam timing and idle speed setpoint are sought {{in the presence of}} input constraints. The results are then validated using a dynamic programming approach on a high fidelity engine model, and compared experimentally with a production calibration for an inline 6 -cylinder, SI gasoline engine. The methodology used can be readily extended to other mixed objective problems, and can be a useful tool in decreasing engine calibration time. 1...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) can salvage gastric cancer patients with para-aortic lymph node (PALN) recurrence. From January 2003 to December 2006, 7 patients were treated for isolated PALN recurrence from gastric cancer after curative resection. Follow <b>up</b> <b>durations</b> ranged from 19 to 33 months (median; 26 months), and SBRT doses from 45 Gy to 51 Gy (median 48 Gy) in 3 fractions. Disease progression-free and overall survivals and toxicities were recorded. Response to treatment was assessed by computed tomography. Final patient outcomes were as follows: 2 were alive without evidence of disease, 3 remained alive with disease, and 2 patients died of disease. Five of 7 patients showed complete response and 2 patients partial response between 3 and 11 months after SBRT. Three-year overall and disease progression-free survival rates post-SBRT were 43 % and 29 %, respectively. No severe complication was detected during follow-up. Selected patients with isolated PALN recurrence can be salvaged by SBRT without severe complications...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{report the}} {{outcomes}} of trans-scleral fixation of posterior chamber intraocul-ar lens (PCIOL) combined with complete vitrectomy and prophylactic band placement. Methods: Hospital records of 18 patients who underwent the procedure were reviewed. Indications for vitreoretinal surgery included previous penetrating ocular trauma, complicated cataract surgery and vitreous incarceration, and chronic cystoid macular edema. All patients had iris and angle damage with inadequate lens capsular support. Age, sex, surgical technique, follow <b>up</b> <b>duration</b> and pre- and postoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were evaluated. Results: Overall 18 eyes of 18 patients (14 men and 4 women) with mean age of 34. 8 ± 23 (range 5 - 76) years were operated. Mean follow <b>up</b> <b>duration</b> was 36 ± 32. 4 (range 6 - 96) months. Of the 18 operated eyes 7 were aphakic, 6 had complete IOL dislocation into the vitreous cavity, 4 had subluxated cataractous lens and one had a subluxated IOL. The number of eyes with BCVA ≥ 20 / 40 increased from 3 (16. 7 %) preoperatively to 9 (50 %) postoperatively (P< 0. 01). Postoperative complications were encountered in 9 eyes and included uveitis, vitreous hemorrhage, repeat IOL dislocation and retinal detachment. Conclusion: In the absence of adequate capsular support, trans-scleral fixation of a PCIOL combined with vitreoretinal surgery seems to be effective for visual rehabilita-tion in selected patients with complicated cataracts or previous cataract surgery. Appli-cation of this technique in children deserves caution. Larger studies and a randomized clinical trial with long-term follow up are required to confirm these results...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effect of single dose corticosteroid and autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) injection in the treatment of tennis elbow. Materials and methods: The 15 elbow of 15 patients (6 male and 9 female) was included in the study, who applied to our clinic with lateral elbow pain and diagnosed as lateral epicondylitis. A single dose of 0, 5 ml Bethametasone and 0, 5 ml Prilocaine mixture was applied to first group and single dose 1 ml autologous PRP was locally applied to the second group. Results: In the early follow-ups the results of corticosteroid group were better than latter follow-ups, however in PRP group the results were worst in early follow-ups but better results were obtained in later follow-ups according to Verhaar scoring system. Conclusion: According to our results, the beneficial effects of PRP injection in lateral epicondylitis increases over time but further studies with more patients and longer follow <b>up</b> <b>durations</b> should done in order to more clarified this subject...|$|R
