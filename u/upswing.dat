They quickly conquered Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium and France surrendered on 22 June. The unexpectedly swift defeat of France resulted in an <b>upswing</b> in Hitler's popularity and a strong upsurge in war fever.|$|E

Season 2 averaged 1.7 million viewers, not enough to avert an imminent cancellation.|$|E
5|$|From 1918–1940, when Estonia was independent, {{the small}} Swedish {{community}} was well treated. Municipalities with a Swedish majority, mainly found along the coast, used Swedish as the administrative language and Swedish-Estonian culture saw an <b>upswing.</b> However, most Swedish-speaking people fled to Sweden {{before the end}} of World War II, that is, before the invasion of Estonia by the Soviet army in 1944.

The <b>upswings,</b> however, are {{also associated with}} sharp increases in disabling work-related injury rates. Data from California for the years from 1953 to 1985 demonstrate the cyclical sensitivity of five types of disabling occupational injuries, fatalities, and acute occupational illnesses to cyclical economic fluctuations.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{correlations}} between unexpected market moves and unexpected equity portfolio moves conditional on market performance. We derive unexpected returns from a two-stage regime switching model. The model allows for time-varying expected returns where the market portfolio alone dictates the regime switching process. Portfolios exhibit a natural hedge where correlations during extreme unexpected market downturns are generally negative. During unexpected market <b>upswings,</b> correlations increase. Using the unconditional analysis would lead to overhedging during market downturns and underhedging during market <b>upswings.</b> The adjustments to the unconditional hedging strategy conditional on extreme market movements frequently exceed � 10 %.

5|$|Brown {{called his}} new {{franchise}} the Bengals because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} that name in the 1930s and {{he thought it would}} provide a link to the past. Brown's son Mike joined the front office and became his father's top assistant and right-hand man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and Bill Walsh. In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the <b>upswing</b> as Brown built up a core group of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E
5|$|Harvard {{was able}} to secure {{substantial}} new funding for its botanical programs {{in the years after}} the war, but Gray encountered significant trouble finding a suitable replacement for his professorial duties. The American university system had failed to train replacements for its professors. Only Harvard and Yale had botany programs, and in the war and pre-war years there had been few botany students. However, after the war there was an <b>upswing</b> in the numbers of botany students. Gray was grooming Horace Mann Jr. as his replacement, but he died of tuberculosis at the age of 24 in November 1868.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the brothel was {{expanded}} again. A one-story structure {{was added to}} the building, increasing the number of cribs by eight; four of the added cribs opened directly onto Pleasant Alley, by that time known as Venus Alley. When copper prices went up, the more than 14,000 miners in the city experienced a pay-rise of twenty-five cents and injected an additional $6,000 into Butte's economy. The Dumas also experienced an <b>upswing</b> in patronage. As a result of the added patronage, the brothel added five partitions and a staircase in 1916, and the ground floor, once a grand parlor, was partitioned into cribs.|$|E

5|$|A {{coincidental}} <b>upswing</b> in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Cook was {{presented}} {{with the opportunity to}} become the CEO and controlling partner for the International Academy of Music Arts and Sciences (IAMAS Corporation). Years earlier, the company merged with its daughter company, The American Musical Academy of Arts Association, which proved profitable as there was an <b>upswing</b> in demand for Christian-based music and distribution opportunities. This was profitable as IAMAS was able to use its history in the entertainment industry as a door to help boost other smaller companies into existence. In 2004, the entertainment industry took a huge hit with the incoming markets of Napster, iTunes, and Amazon.com. IAMAS, no longer able to compete, decided to sell off only its American division and retain its overseas holdings. Since IAMAS Corporation had handled Cook's contracts since 1980, Cook offered to buy the company for an undisclosed amount. His offer was accepted and he officially filed for corporation status on November 24, 2004.|$|E
5|$|On the {{national}} level, sanctions and suspension of donor aid amounting to 50 percent of {{the national}} budget and 70 percent of public investments obstructed the Rajoelina administration's management of state affairs and its ability to systematically combat poverty on a wider scale. A United Nations envoy concluded in 2011 that Rajoelina's controversial accession to the presidency had reduced food security, with Madagascar ranking among the worst in the world for child nutrition. The frequent non-payment of civil servant and military salaries resulted in regular school and hospital closures, general strikes and widespread increases in corruption. Crime and insecurity grew dramatically, with a sharp <b>upswing</b> in violent crime and theft in Antananarivo and increasingly frequent and deadly incidences of armed cattle rustling in the central southern region of the island. Key development indicators steeply declined between 2009 and 2013, including maternal and child mortality, education enrollment and completion, per capita income and employment rates. In 2010 the United Nations ranked Madagascar among the ten poorest countries in the world, noting that economic gains made under Ravalomanana had been lost following Rajoelina's unconstitutional rise to power. In 2011, Forbes magazine ranked Madagascar as the worst economy in the world, faulting its political instability and poor governance.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} salience of Germany’s bilateral relations to the United States, France and Britain in the German media {{since the end of}} the cold war. It offers a media content frequency analysis which identifies long-term similarities and differences in media reporting across the three relationships as well as short-term <b>upswings</b> of media interest in each of them individually. This is relevant because the media salience of bilateral relations is a measure of their underpinnings in public discourse and speaks to the significance of domestic drivers in conducting such relationships. The article finds that media reporting on Germany’s three bilateral relations under study has significantly increased in the post- 9 / 11 period and that US–German and Franco–German relations attract far more attention in the German media than Anglo–German relations. Short-term <b>upswings</b> in media coverage are triggered by specific types of events, in particular crises in European integration and international military missions...|$|R

40|$|The current {{recovery}} of the German economy {{has so far been}} weaker than in previous <b>upswings,</b> putting into question the conventional notion that a strong increase in external demand will translate into a sustained {{recovery of}} domestic demand. Private consumption and capital formation, in particular, have been unsatisfactory in recent years. This Country Focus argues that it is mainly the latter which {{is at the root of}} Germany’s economic problems. There is a large negative investment gap in machinery and equipment, indicating substantial scope for catching up. However the weakness of investment in this sector can at least in part be explained by cyclical factors. Moreover construction investment is still undergoing a painful structural adjustment following the build-up of over-capacity after unification. But lifting investment is the key to pulling Germany out of its low-growth trap, and recent indicators suggest that reforms undertaken in the last few years may now at last be making an impact.
