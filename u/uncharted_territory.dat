He engaged many Native American tribes, dealt with many types of renegades and explored vast areas of <b>uncharted</b> <b>territory</b> from Texas to Arizona. During the Spanish–American War, he commanded an occupation force {{and became the first}} military governor of Puerto Principe, Cuba. After 38 continuous years of service to his country, he retired from the Army on October 19, 1899, as a brigadier general. After his retirement, he became a speaker and a writer.|$|E
5|$|With captain Johnson {{and vice}} captain Miller, the main spinner {{and one of}} the two leading fast bowlers {{retiring}} upon their return from the subcontinent, Australia moved into <b>uncharted</b> <b>territory</b> and needed younger bowlers to step up following three successive series losses to England. The 1956–57 Australian season was purely domestic and a chance for the players to stake their claims to be part of Australia's future. Davidson scored 374 runs at 34.00 including three fifties and took 30 wicket at 27.50 from eight matches. His most effective effort was a 5/65 in the second innings of the match between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI. Davidson's effort helped set up a seven-wicket triumph for Harvey's men.|$|E

50|$|Mainman Blake Judd {{said this}} about the new album:The new {{material}} is reminiscent of Assassins with more of a rock and roll edge over all.

25|$|The Plantation of Ulster in 1609 added a {{twist to}} the fate of the parish. Irish-speaking {{families}} who were driven from their fertile lands in the Lagan Valley and the surrounding areas {{made their way to the}} poor boglands of west Donegal. Some of them made it as far as Gweedore and could go no further west. Around the same time, English and Scottish colonists began to arrive when this <b>uncharted</b> <b>territory</b> was converted to baronies. It appears the parish was very sparsely populated up until the 17th century. The first people to arrive lived on the islands or by the shore in clusters, pockets of houses built close together and in each other's shade.|$|E
25|$|The Norvegia expeditions were a {{sequence}} of Antarctic expeditions financed by the Norwegian shipowner and whaling merchant Lars Christensen during the late 1920s and 1930s. Ostensibly their goal was scientific research and the discovery of new whaling grounds, but Christensen also requested permission from the Norwegian Foreign Office to claim for Norway any <b>uncharted</b> <b>territory</b> that was found. By {{the end of the}} second expedition, two small islands in the Southern Ocean, Bouvet Island and Peter I Island, had been annexed. In 1929 Christensen decided to include aeroplanes in the next expedition and appointed Riiser-Larsen its leader. Riiser-Larsen then supervised and took part in mapping most of the Antarctic in this and three further expeditions. More territory was also annexed, this time the large area of the continent known as Queen Maud Land.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{documented}} a 7-month, thousand-mile Franco-Dutch expedition led by Pierre-Dominique Gaisseau, into <b>uncharted</b> <b>territories</b> of {{what was}} then Netherlands New Guinea. [...] The expedition began in the northern region of the Asmat.

5000|$|The rise of German imperialism and {{colonialism}} {{coincided with}} the latter stages of the [...] "Scramble for Africa" [...] during which enterprising German individuals, rather than government entities, competed with other already established colonies and colonialist entrepreneurs.

25|$|All three columns were delayed. Eustis was {{two days}} late departing Volusia {{because of an}} attack by the Seminoles. Clinch's and Lindsay's columns only reached their {{positions}} on March 28. Because of problems crossing through <b>uncharted</b> <b>territory,</b> Eustis's column did not arrive until March 30. Clinch crossed the Withlacoochee on March 29 to attack the Seminoles in the Cove, but found the villages deserted. Eustis's column did fight a skirmish with some Seminoles before reaching its assigned position, but the whole action had killed or captured only a few Seminoles. On March 31 all three commanders, running low on supplies, headed for Fort Brooke. The failure of the expedition to effectively engage the Seminoles {{was seen as a}} defeat, and was blamed on insufficient time for planning and an inhospitable climate.|$|E

500|$|The musical {{performances}} and selection in the episode {{were met with}} mixed response from critics. The original track [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] received general acclaim from critics. Berk praised the performance, and gave it four stars. He opined, [...] "All four stars are for the lyrics [...] in which the lovable dorks sing about being the lovable dorks {{we fell in love}} with [...] ". In her review for the episode, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised the song, and called it a [...] "true anthem" [...] that [...] "ends triumphantly". Raymond Flandez of The Wall Street Journal gave a positive review of the song: [...] "The song grew out of a collaborative brainstorming session that went beyond rhyming dictionaries or first attempts at ditties such as 'Trouty Mouth', 'Big Ass Heart', and 'Hell to the No'." [...] Jarrett Wieselman of the New York Post commended the show for the use of original songs, and wrote [...] "Glee entered <b>uncharted</b> <b>territory</b> last night [...] no, not Kurt's first kiss. I'm talking about New Directions dabbling in, and debuting, their very first original songs. It was as risky for the show as it was for the group since opting to perform wholly new creations would either give them a leg up on the competition or put them six feet under." [...] Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle praised the song, and deemed it [...] "fun and summery".|$|E
5000|$|European {{immigration}} of workers was booming {{during this time}} in American history, as well as industrialization through the railroad system. The invasion of railroads into the western plains is mentioned {{at the very end}} of The Yellow Chief, as ‘Lije Orton comes to visit Clara and Edward in Manhattan. By describing the rails as “penetrating” the prairies, readers can assume Mayne Reid’s bitter reaction to industrialization, as his romantic view of America’s <b>uncharted</b> <b>territories</b> reigns throughout the novel.|$|R
50|$|In 1996 Landers moved {{completely}} {{into the}} realm of imagery. The painting Alone (1996), depicts a diminutive impasto clown in an insufficient rowboat in a vast seascape, invoking Manet’s Rochefort’s Escape. This clown, by replacing the text-as-imagery in his previous paintings, now embodied the innermost thoughts of the artist. Landers went on to paint a series of purely image paintings - clowns in perilous conditions of nature, meant to be allegorical of his new journey into the <b>uncharted</b> <b>territories</b> of painting.|$|R

Despite the name, given that the <b>Uncharted</b> <b>Territories</b> are implied to be much farther away, it is almost certainly not a reference to the real-world star Mintaka.|$|R
500|$|With {{his next}} album, the new decade found Morrison {{following}} his muse into <b>uncharted</b> <b>territory</b> and sometimes merciless reviews. In February 1980, Morrison {{and a group}} of musicians travelled to Super Bear, a studio in the French Alps, to record (on the site of a former abbey) what is considered to be the most controversial album in his discography; later [...] "Morrison admitted his original concept was even more esoteric than the final product." [...] The album, Common One, consisted of six songs; the longest, [...] "Summertime in England", lasted fifteen and one-half minutes and ended with the words,"Can you feel the silence?". NME magazine's Paul Du Noyer called the album [...] "colossally smug and cosmically dull; an interminable, vacuous and drearily egotistical stab at spirituality: Into the muzak." [...] Greil Marcus, whose previous writings had been favourably inclined towards Morrison, critically remarked: [...] "It's Van acting the part of the 'mystic poet' he thinks he's supposed to be." [...] Morrison insisted the album was never [...] "meant to be a commercial album." [...] Biographer Clinton Heylin concludes: [...] "He would not attempt anything so ambitious again. Henceforth every radical idea would be tempered by some notion of commerciality." [...] Later, critics reassessed the album more favourably with the success of [...] "Summertime in England". Lester Bangs wrote in 1982, [...] "Van was making holy music even though he thought he was, and us rock critics had made our usual mistake of paying too much attention to the lyrics." ...|$|E
