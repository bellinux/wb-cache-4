500|$|The cantata {{opens with}} a French overture, unusual in {{featuring}} the chorus in the faster middle section. At the time of Louis XIV an overture in this style was played when the king and his entourage entered a performance. Bach's music expresses a similar respect for {{the authority of the}} town councils. The mostly homophonic slow opening is in the typical dotted rhythms, and shows a remarkable concerto of the trumpets versus the rest of the orchestra. The chorus appears only in the middle section, proclaiming verses from Psalm 147, [...] "" [...] (Praise the Lord, Jerusalem). It uses both fugal techniques and paired entries. The coda is a recapitulation of the first section. Analysis of corrections show that Bach probably used an instrumental piece composed earlier, and that the characteristic <b>upward</b> <b>run</b> on the first word [...] "Preise" [...] was added later. The text from psalm 147,12–14a addresses Jerusalem, but the Leipzig congregation understood it as their city.|$|E

50|$|The second movement, in sonata {{form with}} a six-bar {{transition}} {{in place of}} a central development section, opposes a first section which is mostly a long-breathed clarinet melody over muted strings, to a second group of themes in which —as in the first movement— several <b>upward</b> <b>runs</b> of scales are given to the first violin, alternating with brief phrases of clarinet melody. These scales are given to the clarinet in the recapitulation, and then in the last few bars of the movement, more chromatic than the rest, the scales turn into triplet arpeggios traded between the strings under the closing clarinet phrases.|$|R

50|$|Once {{they have}} found a new nest site, the A. pallens convey this {{information}} to other workers and intermediates through glandular secretions from their antennae. They make <b>upward</b> <b>runs</b> of several centimeters long on vertical surfaces providing a road map of sorts for the adult wasps to follow. The front body of the wasp will angle slightly upward while the antennae works its way upwardly to maintain the connection with the surface. The wings perk up as they make this connection. Typically the A.pallens begin to use this trail about 3 hours after the swarm formation. This means that generally the new site is already being developed. In fact the dragging behavior seen to deposit the glandular secretion by the wasp is seen only after the deposition of building material at the new nest site.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the {{discrepancy}} between financial transactions and activities in the real economy has widened. At the same time, the instability of exchange rates, commodity prices and share prices has increased: In 2007 the volume of financial transactions was 73. 5 times higher than global nominal GDP. Since 1990, it has expanded almost 5 {{times faster than the}} global economy. This expansion is driven by derivative markets, in particular futures and options trading on exchanges. In 2007, its volume was 43. 4 times higher than global GDP. The hike in such transactions was steepest in Germany: in 2007, they were already 52. 6 times higher than GDP. Exchange rates, commodity prices and share prices fluctuate in a sequence of medium-term trends ("bulls and bears"). These trends result from an accumulation of short-term runs, whose durations differ according to their directions: <b>upward</b> <b>runs</b> in a bullish market persist longer than downward runs.

5000|$|The opening chorus in C minor concentrates, without {{instrumental}} introduction, on a choral fugue. A complex theme illustrates both contrasting {{aspects that}} Jeremiah mentioned {{of the human}} heart, rendering [...] "" [...] (defiant) twice, once in a repeated high note reached by a triad fanfare, then in an <b>upward</b> <b>run</b> with a surprising modulation, whereas [...] "" [...] (timid) appears as a sighing motif in chromatism. The strings accompany [...] "" [...] marked forte, [...] "" [...] piano, while the oboes double the voices. Klaus Hofmann notes: [...] "Bach has taken greater pleasure in depicting defiance than in representing timidity (and has thus departed to some extent from his librettist's intention). John Eliot Gardiner translates the text as [...] "There is something stubborn (or defiant or wilful) and fainthearted (or disheartened or despairing) about the human heart", describes the movement as a [...] "dramatic antithesis between headstrong aggression and lily-livered frailty", and wonders [...] "whether this arresting comment on the human condition reflected Bach's own views".|$|E

500|$|The {{expectation}} {{of a world}} to come, [...] "" [...] (And I expect) is a joyful concerto of five voices with trumpets. Marked [...] "Vivace a Allegro", the voices begin with a trumpet fanfare in imitation on the same text as before. The movement {{is based on a}} choral movement dating from about 1729 which is used in [...] and a related wedding cantata BWV 120a. In BWV 120 it sets the words [...] (Exult, you delighted voices). After this statement, which ends in homophony, the instruments begin a short section in which runs in rising sequences alternate with the fanfare, in which the voices are later embedded. The word [...] "resurrectionem" [...] appears then in the runs in the voices, one after the other in cumulation. A second repetition of instruments, embedded voices and <b>upward</b> <b>runs</b> brings the whole section to a jubilant close on the words [...] "" [...] (and the life of the world to come. Amen), with extended runs on [...] "Amen". Wenk likens the movement to a bourrée, a dance in [...] "quick duple meter with an upbeat".|$|R
40|$|A Directional Change Event {{can be a}} Downturn Event or an Upturn Event. A Downward Run is {{a period}} between a Downturn Event and the next Upturn Event. An <b>Upward</b> <b>Run</b> is a period between an Upturn Event and the next Downturn Event. In a Downward Run, a Last Low is {{constantly}} updated to the minimum of (a) the current price and (b) the Last Low. In an <b>Upward</b> <b>Run,</b> a Last High is constantly updated to the maximum of (a) the current price and (b) the Last High. In a Downward Run, given a Threshold (a percentage), an Upturn Event is an event when the price {{is higher than the}} Last Low by the Threshold. An Upturn Event terminates a Downward Run, and starts an <b>Upward</b> <b>Run.</b> In an <b>Upward</b> <b>Run,</b> given a Threshold (a percentage), a Downturn Event is an event when the price is lower than the Last High by the Threshold. A Downturn Event terminates an <b>Upward</b> <b>Run,</b> and starts a Downward Run. The above definitions are mutual recursive. Operationally, we set both the Last High and Last Low to the price {{at the beginning of the}} sequence. A Downturn Event is followed by a Downward Overshoot Event, which is ended by the next Upturn Event, which is itself followed by an Upward Overshoot Event, which is ended by the next Downturn Event. So time is defined by sequences of event cycles of four events, as shown in Figure 1...|$|E
