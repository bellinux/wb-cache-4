This is surprising since - given the institutional structure - risk selection between systems is likely to be more pronounced. We find clear evidence for risk selection in favor of private insurers. While private insurers are unable to select the healthy upon enrollment they manage to dump high risk individuals who then end up in the public system. This gives private insurers an <b>unjustified</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>advantage</b> vis- 0 -vis public insurer. A risk adjusted compensation would mitigate this advantage...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Operators at Swedish {{combustion}} plants have raised {{a concern that}} the stringency of boiler specific NOx emission standards varies between counties, potentially causing <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> for plants in counties with relatively less stringent regulations. By utilizing a unique dataset we are provided {{with an opportunity to}} analyse the determinants of emission standard stringency in order to explain these potential variations. Relying on pooled OLS estimations we find that more stringent standards are imposed in counties where the NOx associated environmental damages are more severe. We also find that less stringent standards are imposed in counties where concerns about the employment levels are higher or where the environmental awareness among the inhabitants is lower. Furthermore we find that plants with a higher bargaining power obtain less stringent standards. The last three findings indicate that structural differences in the regulation is present, potentially leading to <b>unjustified</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> for some plants. This suggests that a more uniform enforcement of the emission standards between Swedish counties may be necessary...|$|R
