25|$|The {{extent of}} alcohol myopia’s effects on one’s {{decisions}} about how to react to sexual arousal is dependent upon the level of confliction one feels. The more intense the personal conflict {{of whether or not}} to use a condom, the greater effect alcohol has on the final decision to engage in risky sexual behavior. Intoxicated males who had felt heavily conflicted about condom use were least likely to use a condom. Those intoxicated men who had been less conflicted about <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> were {{more likely to engage in}} safe sex. Therefore, some intoxicated individuals can actually be less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior than their sober counterparts, given appropriate cues. The effects of alcohol myopia on response to sexual arousal also depend on the level of sexual arousal. When sexual arousal levels were high, a greater percentage of men reported not <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> than when arousal levels were low. This goes back to the importance of saliency in alcohol myopia. The more salient the external cue (in this case, higher levels of sexual arousal were more salient than lower levels) the more likely it is for alcohol to inhibit the comprehension of the consequences of an action.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} tested the {{efficacy}} of implementation intentions in promoting condom use by means of three studies. First, {{the efficacy of}} implementation intentions targeting a personally selected behavior related to condom use (e. g., buying, carrying, talking about and actually using condoms) was examined {{in a sample of}} STI clinic clients (Study 1). Also, the possibility of using implementation intentions as a means to create a cognitive link between the critical situation and the goal to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> was investigated in a sample of sexually active people (Study 2 & 3). Results revealed that implementation intentions targeting a personally selected behavior related to condom use did not promote condom use (Study 1), most likely because the goal to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> is temporarily abandoned in situations where condom use is actually required (Study 2). However, implementation intentions directly targeting the goal to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> were shown to increase the accessibility of this goal when the intention to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> was strong (Study 3). This finding suggests that implementation intentions could be effective in promoting condom use by increasing accessibility of the goal to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> in situ. Future studies should focus on the question whether this new type of implementation intention can be used to promote actual condom use...|$|R

40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{based on}} the Theory of Reasoned Action was developed and tested to identify predictors of intention to use condoms. The questionnaire consisted of three original components: Behavioral Intentions, Attitudes and Subjective Normative Beliefs, and a new component, Behavioral Norms. Age of HIV antibody status were also collected. Internal consistency of the four components of the questionnaire was high: Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranged from 0. 76 to 0. 87. Logistic modelling identified the significant predictors of intentions to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> as Attitudes (Odds Ratio = 2. 7, 95 % CI 1. 80 − 4. 06, P < 0. 001) and Behavioral Norms (Odds Ratio = 1. 49, 95 % CI 1. 06 − 2. 11, P = 0. 03). Contrary to the theory that demographic variables are not important predictive variables of intention, HIV antibody positive status and age were found to directly influence Behavioral Intentions to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom.</b> About 50 % of men older than 25 years of age intended to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom,</b> irrespective of HIV status. Overall, 59 % of men 25 {{years of age and}} younger intended to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom,</b> but the percentage was affected by HIV status; 22 % in men who were HIV positive and 63 % in men who were HIV negative. These findings indicate that after modification, to include HIV antibody status, Age and Behavioral Norms, the Theory of Reasoned Action can identify significant predictors of intention to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the role that cultural background plays in a woman 2 ̆ 7 s negotiation of condom use. Previous research has failed to address intercultural differences in the negotiation and planning of condom use messages. Four research questions were addressed in this study: (1) How, if at all, do African American and European American women differ in their use of compliance-gaining strategies when attempting to persuade <b>a</b> partner to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom?</b> (2) What relationship, if any, is there between the culture of the communicator, the secondary goals, and a woman 2 ̆ 7 s choice of compliance-gaining strategies when persuading her partner to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom?</b> (3) What influence, if any, does the culture of the participant have on her planning of compliance-gaining messages when persuading her partner to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom?</b> and (4) What influence, if any, does a woman 2 ̆ 7 s culture and her use of compliance-gaining strategies have on her reported level of condom use? These research questions were explored <b>using</b> <b>a</b> survey research approach. A total of 538 respondents completed the survey, which was designed to investigate the types of compliance-gaining messages women were likely to use and the reasons why they chose those strategies. There were two key findings in this study. First, African American women were more likely to simply ask their partners to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom,</b> to present factual information, to criticize their partners, to deceive their partners, and to threaten their partners. Second, women who present factual information to persuade their partners to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> are the most likely to actually <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom.</b> On <b>a</b> practical level, the results of this research indicated that HIV/AIDS prevention programs should be culturally sensitive. In addition, it seems as though women should not only be given safer sex education, but also be taught how to use that information in their persuasive messages. ...|$|R
