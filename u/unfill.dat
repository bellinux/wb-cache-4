40|$|The under-drive {{brake piston}} is an {{essential}} part in the automatic transmissions of automobiles. This component is manufactured by forging after blanking from S 55 C plate with a thickness of 6 mm. It is difficult to design the plate forging process using a thick plate approach since there will be limited material flow as well as large press loads. Furthermore, the under-drive brake piston has a complex shape with a right angle step, which often results in die <b>unfill</b> and abrupt increase in press load. To overcome these obstacles, a separate die for filling material sufficiently to the corner of the right angle step is proposed. However, this approach induces an uncontrolled workpiece surface between the dies, resulting in flash. This excess flash degrades the tool life in the final machining after cold forging as well as increases the cycle time to obtain the net-shape of the part. In the current study, we propose an optimum process design using a conventional die shaped with the benefit of finite element analysis. This approach enhanced the process efficiency without sacrificing the dimensional accuracy in the forged part. As the result, the optimum plate forging process was done with a two stage die, which reduce...|$|E

Meanwhile, the remained ones identified as normal from their external appearance were proved, when examined anatomically, to contain abnormal seeds of 33 - 0 x 1. fcedp+ 0 t showing cell shrinkage or collapse on surface of cotyledon, plumule or other organs and inducing brown colored spot or coloration when advanced. The abnormality of this type, though hidden at inner part of seeds, was ascertained, through microscopical examination, as same sign of <b>unfilling</b> to the previously reported nonpathological phenomena that existed on seed surface. And therefore {{it was revealed that}} the occurrence of <b>unfilling</b> is strikingly greater than the actual number counted by external appearance. (2) Usually the sign of <b>unfilling</b> does not develop isolately on the organs of seedcoat, cotyledon and plumule, but there is found an apparent tendency that it begins to appear earlier on plumule and cotyledon than on seedcoat, and furthermore initialiy at the inside of respective organ.

This study {{is an attempt to}} determine the reasons for <b>unfilled</b> requests within the Gaelic library consortium in South Africa. The results of this study enable interlending staff to take remedial actions within their institutions. Supplying and requesting fill rates differ. In practice, the request fill rate is the more important. Librarians looking to improve client satisfaction and expectations should focus on this hidden aspect of interlending. Methodology used: management information retrieved from the request interlending system for the participating libraries formed the base point of the research. Data included the number of requests placed and filled, and reasons for <b>unfilled</b> requests. This data was analysed, and fill rates calculated. In depth research into the <b>unfilled</b> requests was done, which resulted in being able to offer suggestions for remedial measures for different <b>unfilled</b> reasons. Indicators to measure library performance are identified. Conclusions drawn from the study: previously reasons for <b>unfilled</b> requests have been mainly speculative; research however confirmed that the hypothesis proved to be correct. The fill rate of requests are determined by the quality of work, the quantity of items requested, and effectiveness of staff within service units, along with sufficient staff capacity and their levels of experience. 2...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The study {{evaluates the}} {{behavior}} of different adhesive systems and resin cements in fiber post placement, {{with the intent to}} clarify the possible role of <b>unfilled</b> resin as a luting material for fiber posts. Materials and Methods: Two luting agents (Dual-Link and <b>Unfilled</b> Resin) for cementing fiber posts into root canals were applied either with All-Bond 2 or One-Step Plus, or without an adhesive system, and challenged with the push-out test. Slices of roots restored with posts were loaded until post segment extrusion in the apical-coronal direction. Failure modes were analyzed under SEM. Results: Push-out strength was significantly influenced by the luting agent (p 0. 05). The best results were obtained in combination with <b>Unfilled</b> Resin with One-Step Plus. Dual-Link groups failed mainly cohesively within the cement, while <b>Unfilled</b> Resin demonstrated more adhesive fracture at the post interface. Conclusion: The results of this study support the hypothesis that adhesive <b>unfilled</b> resin application is essential for achieving high bond strength to radicular dentin...|$|R

Army {{distributes}} its 51, 000 competitive category officers among manning targets {{specified by}} location, rank and skill that {{change over time}} in response to changing requirements. The officer inventory also changes over time and does not exactly match the manning target requirements. The Army responds to imbalances by redistributing officers {{in order to provide}} each location with the minimum required officers while minimizing the number of <b>unfilled</b> targets and excess officers at each location. This thesis focuses on branch officers, branch targets and generalist targets with ranks from Branch Qualified Captain to Colonel. Using data provided by the Army, we formulate an integer programming model called DISTRIBUTOR. When DISTRIBUTOR allows all officers in the inventory to move, it finds only 340 <b>unfilled</b> targets but this requires 4, 688 or 28 % of the inventory to move. We reduce the number of moves by using DISTRIBUTOR in two sequential steps. The first step optimally distributes officers at each location and identifies the excess officers and <b>unfilled</b> targets at each location. The second step takes the excess officers and distributes them to <b>unfilled</b> targets at other locations. The two-step leaves only 346 targets <b>unfilled</b> (6 more) but requires only 1, 373 or 8 % of the inventory to move.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the bond strength of a composite resin to glass-fiber post (GFP) treated or not with phosphoric acid, silane coupling agent, and <b>unfilled</b> resin. GFPs were etched or not with 37 % phosphoric acid and different surface coating applied: silane coupling agent, <b>unfilled</b> resin, or both. Composite resin blocks were built around a 4 -mm height on the GFP. <b>Unfilled</b> resin (20 s) and composite resin (40 s) were light activated by a light-emitting diode unit. The specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 h. Microtensile bond test was performed using a mechanical testing machine until failure (n= 10). The data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls' test (p< 0. 05). Failure modes were classified as adhesive, mixed, or cohesive failures. Additional specimens (n= 3) were made to analyze the bonded interfaces by scanning electron microscopy. The statistical analysis showed the factor 'surface coating' was significant (p< 0. 05), whereas the factor 'HP etching' (p= 0. 131) and interaction between the factors (p= 0. 171) were not significant. The highest bond strength was found for the silane and <b>unfilled</b> resin group (p< 0. 05). A predominance of adhesive and cohesive failures was found. Differences regarding the homogeneity and thickness of the <b>unfilled</b> resin layer formed by different GFP surface treatments were observed.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The {{purpose of}} this {{laboratory}} {{study was to determine}} if the bond strengths of composite resins and <b>unfilled</b> resins was affected similarly when applied to enamel surfaces which had been previously etched with 50 per cent phosphoric acid. The test specimens were subjected to 24 hours, 30 days, and 6 months storage in water and then subjected to temperature stress cycling and intermittent tensile stress cycling. A tensile test was used to measure the bond strengths of the composite resins (Adaptic and HL- 72) and the <b>unfilled</b> resin (Sevriton). The following results were obtained: (1) Pretreating the enamel surface with 50 per cent phosphoric acid for 60 seconds significantly increased the bond strength of composite resins; (2) when placed on acid etched enamel, {{there was no significant difference}} in initial bond strengths obtained for the Adaptic and <b>unfilled</b> Sevriton resins; (3) with prolonged water storage, the Adaptic composite resins developed significant loss of bond strength when compared to the <b>unfilled</b> Sevriton resins and the composite HL- 72 resins; (4) when Adaptic resins and the HL- 72 resin specimens were compared, there was no significant difference in initial bond strengths but the HL- 72 specimens were less affected by storage time. Ca 45 was used to assess the marginal seal of Adaptic, HL- 72, and Sevriton in acid etched and non-etched Class V restorations. One-half of the specimens were thermal cycled 2500 times and stored in water for one week. Control specimens were tested at the end of one week without the thermal cycle. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that acid etching enhances the marginal seal of both composite and <b>unfilled</b> resins. Both composite and <b>unfilled</b> resins experienced increased marginal leakage when the acid etch preparations were thermal cycled, but there were no observable difference in the marginal seal of <b>unfilled</b> resins and composite resins when placed in acid etched restorations...|$|R
40|$|Three {{different}} fillers, {{carbon black}} (CB), vapor grown carbon fibers (VGCF), and TiO 2, {{were incorporated into}} polysulfone spinning solutions {{with the intention of}} producing highly selective membranes with enhanced mechanical strength. The effect of filler presence on gas permeation characteristics, mechanical strength (bursting pressure), and morphology was investigated and compared to <b>unfilled</b> membranes. As well as studying filler types, the influence of CB filler concentration on membrane performance was also examined. For all filler types (at a concentration of 5 %w/w), the pressure-normalized flux of O 2, N 2, and CH 4 was greater in the composite than in the <b>unfilled</b> membranes. The CO 2 pressure-normalized flux was only greater in the TiO 2 composite membranes. For CB and VGCF, the CO 2 pressure-normalized flux was reduced compared with <b>unfilled</b> membranes. Three CB concentrations were investigated (2, 5, and 10 %w/w). For O 2, N 2, and CH 4, pressure-normalized flux peaked at 5 %w/w CB. CO 2 exhibited the opposite trend, showing a minimum pressure-normalized flux at 5 %w/w. Considering O 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 gas pairs and the various filled membrane categories, only the O 2 /N 2 selectivity of the 2 %w/w CB filled membranes was higher than that of the <b>unfilled</b> fibers—all other selectivities were lower. In terms of CB concentration, selectivity was a minimum at the intermediate concentration of 5 %w/w. All the filled membrane types exhibited greater mechanical strength (bursting pressure) than <b>unfilled</b> fibers apart from the 5 %w/w VGCF composites. The 2 %w/w CB composites were the strongest.

Treeing pattern and tree growth duration for <b>unfilled</b> and nano-filled LDPE samples have also been studied. Different tree growth patterns as well as a slower tree growth with increase in filler loading in LDPE nanocomposites were observed. The observed slow propagation of tree growth with filler loading is attributed to the changes in the polymer crystalline morphology induced by the presence of nano-particles and the greater ability of the nanoparticles to resist discharge growth. SEM studies carried out to determine the morphology of <b>unfilled</b> and nano-filled LDPE showed an increase in lamellae packing in LDPE nanocomposites and this increased lamellar density leads to a reduction in the tree propagation rate. Partial discharge activities were also monitored during the electrical tree growth in both the <b>unfilled</b> and the nano-filled LDPE samples and were found to be significantly different.
