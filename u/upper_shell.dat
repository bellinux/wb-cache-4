5|$|The {{spotted turtle}} and painted turtle {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the bog turtle. The bog turtle is distinguishable from any other species of turtle by the distinctively colored blotch on its neck.

25|$|The common box turtle (Terrapene carolina) {{gets its}} common {{name from the}} {{structure}} of its shell which consists of a high domed carapace (<b>upper</b> <b>shell),</b> and large, hinged plastron (lower shell) which allows the turtle to close the shell, sealing its vulnerable head and limbs safely within an impregnable box. The carapace is brown, often adorned with a variable pattern of orange or yellow lines, spots, bars or blotches. The plastron is dark brown and may be uniformly coloured, or show darker blotches or smudges.|$|E
25|$|The XWB's {{nose section}} will adopt a {{configuration}} {{derived from the}} A380 with a forward-mounted nosegear bay and a six-panel flightdeck windscreen. This differs substantially from the four-window arrangement in the original design. The new nose will improve aerodynamics and enable overhead crew rest areas to be installed further forward and eliminate any encroachment in the passenger cabin. The new windscreen has been revised to improve vision by reducing {{the width of the}} centre post. The <b>upper</b> <b>shell</b> radius of the nose section has been increased. The nose is likely to be constructed from aluminium but Airbus is currently running trade-off studies considering a one-piece carbon fibre structure. According to Gordon McConnell, A350 Chief Engineer, a carbon fibre structure would need titanium reinforcements for birdstrike protection, thus the aluminium structure is the best cost-wise.|$|E

25|$|The {{vessel was}} built by a method of {{construction}} known as shell-first or plating, meaning that the frame was built first with the later addition of a skeleton. It was, however, not built entirely shell-first, but involved some elements of skeleton or frame-first construction. The keel, extended by a long fore foot ending with a concave stempost tilted towards the back, was laid first, then edge jointed by mortise (10 to 12cm deep and 8cm wide) and tenon (20 to 22cm long, 8cm wide, and 1.5cm thick), construction to three strakes. This first section of the ship, the keel and the first three planks, was made from elm. Floor timbers were then bolted directly to the keel, giving greater rigidity to the internal skeleton. Next, {{the rest of the}} framing was added, joined with straight nails and treenails. These few early frames acted as guides and supports during construction. Then, the rest of the planking was added, the lower skeleton first, followed by the <b>upper</b> <b>shell</b> (independent of the frames, with treenails inserted from inside the hull). Futtocks were inserted last and a second skin of thinner planks of fir was fitted to the exterior of the ship and covered in lead. A layer of planks, 6cm thick, was also fitted inside in order to cover the internal frames, strengthening the hull through double planking and elaborate, complex keel scarves. A massive cutwater, over a length of 1.45m, placed against the front-butt protected and strengthened the stern of the axial frame.|$|E

500|$|The {{bodywork}} {{was made}} from two injection-moulded polypropylene shells supplied by three manufacturers; J.J. Harvey of Manchester made the moulds, Linpac provided the shells, and ICI supplied the raw material. According to Rodney Dale, the <b>upper</b> <b>shell</b> mould was [...] "one of the largest – if not the largest – injection mouldings of its type in the UK: possibly even in the world". The manufacturing process reflected Sinclair's ambition for the C5 production line. A single mould set was capable of producing up to 4,000 parts every week. The {{two parts of the}} shell were joined together by wrapping a tape around the joint, aligning them on a jig, pressing them together and passing an electric current through the tape to heat and melt it. The same process was used to make the front and rear bumper assemblies of the Austin Maestro and only took about 70 seconds to complete. Although Sinclair had considered producing the C5 at the DeLorean plant at Dunmurry in Northern Ireland, which had one of Europe's most advanced automated plastic-body manufacturing facilities, this was not to be, as the DeLorean Motor Company failed in a controversial bankruptcy that resulted in the plant's closure.|$|E
6000|$|This dainty little {{execution}} {{was hardly}} over when Teddy shouted from the bedroom, [...] "Oh, the little trabs are out, {{and the big}} one's eaten 'em all up." [...] Demi and his aunt ran to the rescue, and found Teddy dancing excitedly in a chair, while two little crabs were scuttling about the floor, having got through the wires of the cage. A third was clinging {{to the top of}} the cage, evidently in terror of his life, for below appeared a sad yet funny sight. The big crab had wedged himself into the little recess where Polly's cup used to stand, and there he sat eating one of his relations in the coolest way. All the claws of the poor victim were pulled off, and he was turned upside down, his <b>upper</b> <b>shell</b> held in one claw close under the mouth of the big crab like a dish, while he leisurely ate out of it with the other claw, pausing now and then to turn his queer bulging eyes from side to side, and to put out a slender tongue and lick them in a way that made the children scream with laughter. Mrs. Jo carried the cage in for Dan to see the sight, while Demi caught and confined the wanderers under an inverted wash-bowl.|$|E
