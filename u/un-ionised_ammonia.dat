25|$|Ammonia {{toxicity}} {{is believed}} to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species. At lower concentrations, around 0.05mg/L, <b>un-ionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases. Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate. At concentrations exceeding 2.0mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death. Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0mg/l.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{dissolved}} oxygen concentration combined with sublethal doses of <b>un-ionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> nitrogen (UIA-N) on growth and physiology were investigated in juvenile turbot. Fish with a mean ± SD initial weight of 19. 1 ± 4. 1 g, were reared in replicate at normoxic (80 ¿ 85 % O 2 saturation) and hyperoxic (110 ¿ 115 % O 2 saturation) conditions, combined with either control or two sublethal concentrations of <b>un-ionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> (0, 0. 17 and 0. 31 mg UIA-N l¿ 1) added for 64 days at 18 °C and pH 8. 04 in a flow-through system. The subsequent effect of fixed O 2 and UIA concentrations on growth and blood physiology was measured every 22 days. The results show that UIA-N concentrations only had {{a negative effect on}} growth under normoxic conditions, suggesting that hyperoxic conditions may increase tolerance to <b>un-ionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> in juvenile turbot. Only minor effects on the acid-base balance were found. A generally higher blood CO 2 and PCO 2, along with an accumulation of HCO 3 ¿ resulting in an increased blood pH was found in the hyperoxic groups {{towards the end of the}} experiment. We conclude that, under normoxic conditions, a chronic exposure of ammonia above 0. 17 mg UIA-N l¿ 1 will have a negative effect on growth and that hyper-oxygenation can be a possible solution to counteract this harmful effect...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{saltwater}} toxicity data {{in tropical}} regions, toxicity data generated from temperate or cold water species endemic to North America and Europe are often adopted to derive water quality guidelines (WQG) for protecting tropical saltwater species. If chemical toxicity to most saltwater organisms increases with water temperature, the use of temperate species data and associated WQG may result in under-protection to tropical species. Given the differences in species composition and environmental attributes between tropical and temperate saltwater ecosystems, there are conceivable uncertainties in such 'temperate-to-tropic' extrapolations. This study aims to compare temperate and tropical saltwater species' acute sensitivity to 11 chemicals through a comprehensive meta-analysis, by comparing species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) between the two groups. A 10 percentile hazardous concentration (HC 10) is derived from each SSD, and then a temperate-to-tropic HC 10 ratio is computed for each chemical. Our results demonstrate that temperate and tropical saltwater species display significantly different sensitivity towards all test chemicals except cadmium, although such differences are small with the HC 10 ratios ranging from 0. 094 (<b>un-ionised</b> <b>ammonia)</b> to 2. 190 (pentachlorophenol) only. Temperate species are more sensitive to <b>un-ionised</b> <b>ammonia,</b> chromium, lead, nickel and tributyltin, whereas tropical species are more sensitive to copper, mercury, zinc, phenol and pentachlorophenol. Through comparison of a limited number of taxon-specific SSDs, we observe that there is a general decline in chemical sensitivity from algae to crustaceans, molluscs and then fishes. Following a statistical analysis of the results, we recommend an extrapolation factor of two for deriving tropical WQG from temperate information. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) {{were exposed}} {{periodically}} and chronically to {{different levels of}} <b>un-ionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> (UIA-N) and the subsequent effect on growth and food conversion efficiency was studied. Fish with a mean (SD) initial weight 19. 3 (3. 9) g, were exposed to five treatments consisting of a control group, two groups (ChronicLow and ChronicHigh, UIA-N levels of 0. 13 and 0. 25 mg l- 1, respectively) chronically exposed to ammonia and two groups (LowPulse and HighPulse) exposed to the same levels as above {{for a short period}} daily. The fish were held for 64 days at 18 °C, a pH of 8. 04 and a salinity of 33. 5 ‰. At the end of the experiment, fish from the Control group had a significantly higher mean weight (95. 5 g) compared to all other groups. Fish from the ChronicHigh group displayed the lowest mean weight (74. 6 g), whereas fish in the ChronicLow, LowPulse and HighPulse groups displayed mean weights of: 79. 3 g, 82. 8 g and 81. 9 g, respectively. Blood ion concentrations were not affected significantly in any of the treatments, whereas minor reductions in blood pH, partial pressure of CO 2 and total CO 2 content were found in ammonia exposed groups up until day 44 of the experiment. Feed conversion efficiency, daily feeding rate and total feed consumption did not vary significantly between treatments. The study demonstrate that short daily ammonia peaks may result in negative effects on growth, equivalent to that found under chronic ammonia exposure in juvenile turbot...|$|E
40|$|Uncontrolled {{leachate}} {{emissions are}} one of the key factors in the environmental impact of municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. The concentration of ammonium, given the anaerobic conditions in traditional landfills, can remain significantly high for a very long period of time, as degradation does not take place and volatilisation is not significant (the pH is not high enough to considerably shift the equilibrium towards <b>un-ionised</b> <b>ammonia).</b> Recent years have witnessed a continuous enhancement of landfill technology in order to minimize uncontrolled emissions into the environment; bottom lining systems have been improved and more attention has been devoted {{to the study of the}} attenuation of the different chemicals in leachate in case of migration through the mineral barrier. Different natural materials have been considered for use as components of landfill liners in the last years and tested in order to evaluate the performance of the different alternatives. Among those materials, bentonite is often used, coupled with other materials in two different ways: in addition to in situ soil or in geocomposite clay liner (GCL). A lab-scale test was carried out in order to further investigate the influence of bentonite on the attenuation of ammonium in leachate passing through a landfill liner. Two different tests were conducted: a standardized batch test with pulverized bentonite and a batch test with compacted bentonite. The latter was proposed in order to better simulate the real conditions in a landfill liner. The two tests produced values for the partition coefficient K-d higher than the average measured for other natural materials usually utilized as components of landfill liners. Moreover, the two tests showed similar results, thus providing a further validation of the suitability of the standard batch test with pulverized bentonite. A thorough knowledge of attenuation processes of ammonium in landfill liners is the basis for the application of risk analysis models for the evaluation of the failure of bottom liners or their components...|$|E
40|$|Water quality {{changes that}} occur during {{establishment}} and maintenance of nitrification in two identical recirculating aquaculture systems containing rainbow trout are described. The time taken for the nitrification process to become established was 40 - 45 days. Mortality of fish attributed to elevated nitrite concentrations were recorded during the initial conditioning phase of the systems. <b>Un-ionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> concentrations did not attain lethal levels during this period. Nitrate concentrations accumulated slowly throughout the study, while the pH and alkalinity of the water decreased with progressive nitrification. Levels of carbon dioxide, calcium, dissolved and suspended solids remained relatively stable until the carrying capacity of the systems was increased, upon which they increased rapidly and general water quality deteriorated. Permanently elevated concentrations of ammonia and nitrite served as {{an indication that the}} carrying capacity of the systems had been exceeded. The use of ozone as a water enhancement treatment in aquaculture systems during one- and six-hour applications was also considered in this study. Ozonation significantly reduced nitrite levels at · low concentrations (0, 1 - 0, 15 mg/l), although they returned to pre-treatment levels within a few hours of cessation of the treatment. The formation of an unstable, intermediate product that reforms as nitrite in the absence of ozone, rather than the complete oxidation of nitrite to nitrate, is proposed. Ozonation also resulted in decreased dissolved solids, and improved the clarity and odour of the water. Ozone had no effect on ammonia concentrations (at pH > 7, 0), or on nitrate or calcium levels, and did not conclusively increase the redox potential of the water. Residual ozone concentrations up to 0, 04 mg/l in a sixhour treatment had no harmful effects on rainbow trout, and there were no signs of gas-bubble disease arising from supersaturation of the water with oxygen. Activated carbon filters were effective at removing residual ozone from the water after treatment. Treatment of the water with oxygen alone had no effect on nitrite concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Acutely toxic {{concentrations}} (LC 50) {{of ammonia}} and nitrite were estimated for juvenile silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) during 96 h experiments. Additional experiments were conducted {{for at least}} 25 days to determine the growth-limiting concentrations of ammonia and nitrite for juvenile silver perch. Furthermore, the effects of exposure to metabolic and reagent ammonia were compared. Gill histopathology was examined in each experiment to determine if changes in gill structure correlated with exposure to toxicant, and whether gill histopathology was a useful indicator of sub-acute intoxication for this species. The acutely toxic concentration (LC 50) of <b>un-ionised</b> <b>ammonia</b> (UAN) {{was defined as the}} concentration at which silver perch lost the ability to orientate. At this point, fish were removed from the experiment, as preliminary research had shown that prolonged exposure beyond this point always led to death. The LC 50 was estimated to be 1. 2 mg L- 1 UAN. The acutely toxic concentration (LC 50) of nitrite was estimated to be 160 mg L- 1 NO 2 -N. Following a 39 day exposure, growth (wet weight gain) of juvenile silver perch was reduced at concentrations of ammonia above 0. 36 mg L- 1 UAN. There {{was no significant difference in}} wet weight gain of control fish or those exposed to 0. 02 mg L- 1 metabolic ammonia. Growth of silver perch exposed to nitrite at concentrations above 1. 43 mg L - 1 N 02 -N for 25 days was reduced. Following acute exposure to ammonia, there was a significant increase in the percentage of filaments affected by epithelial lifting, but no other significant change in gill histopathology was observed. Acute exposure to nitrite resulted in no significant changes in gill histopathology, although macroscopic observation indicated browning and discolouration of gill tissue at concentrations above 130 mg L- 1 NO 2 -N. After 39 days' exposure to ammonia, there was an increase in the occurrence of epithelial lifting, while no other index of gill histopathology was significantly different. Exposure to metabolic ammonia also increased the percentage of filaments affected by epithelial lifting. Following 25 days' exposure to nitrite, there was a significant difference in the percentage of gill filaments affected by epithelial lifting and hypertrophy. These results indicate critical concentrations of ammonia and nitrite which will assist in the management of nitrogenous wastes in pond or tank culture of silver perch. Understanding of these concentrations may increase production and reduce the incidence of critical water quality conditions...|$|E
40|$|Development of a {{sustainable}} wastewater treatment scheme to recycle sewage nutrients {{and water in}} tilapia aquaculture was the main objective of this PhD research. Use of an Integrated UASB-duckweed ponds system for domestic wastewater treatment linked to tilapia aquaculture was investigated. The treatment system was efficiënt in organic matter removal during the entire year, while nitrogen, phosphorus and faecal coliform removal were negatively affected by the decline in temperature in winter. Most ofthe nitrogen removal was achieved by plant uptake (81 %) while 14. 5 % and 4. 5 % of the removal was due to denitrification and sedimentation, respectively. The treatment system provided effluent quality and duckweed biomass suitable for reuse in tilapia aquaculture. The nutritional value. fresh duckweed was significantly better than for wheat bran and similar to the commercial feed wher used in combination with treated sewage from the duckweed ponds. Using treated sewage enhanced the yield of tilapia and makes the combined feed of treated sewage and duckweed similar in results to the fishmeal-based commercial feed. At <b>un-ionIsed</b> <b>ammonia</b> concentrations above 0. 1 mg UIA-N F^ the chronic ammonia toxicity to duckweed-fed tilapia significantly reduced the growth. Other water quality parameters (pathogens, nitrite, low dissolved oxygen) had synergistic effects on ammonia toxicity. Similarly, ammonia, nitrite and low dissolved oxygen had synergistic effects on the faecal coliform count in tilapia tissues and organs. Therefore pf treatment of sewage is preferable before use in aquaculture for maximum yield and quality assuranc* The optimum feeding rate was 25 gram fresh duckweed per 100 gram of live fish weight at 16 - 25 °C. The results on apparent duckweed digestibility showed a negative effect of the bulky volume of the; fresh duckweed at 40 % inclusion while at 20 % the digestibility coefficients were similar for fresh and dry duckweed. The replacement of fishmeal, fish oil and plant Ingredients by 20 % and 40 % dry duckweed or 20 % fresh duckweed is nutritionally possible and economically attractive.

40|$|Whole-sediment {{toxicity}} {{identification and}} evaluation (WS-TIE) {{is a relatively}} new approach for assessing the cause of toxic effects to benthic organisms in sediments. Akin to aqueous TIE methods, the premise of the WS-TIE method is that the chemical toxicant(s) responsible for observed effects can be identified through a series of treatments that are designed to reduce the bioavailability and, thus, toxicity of key contaminant classes. While standardised WS-TIE methods have been developed for a range of contaminants (US EPA, 2007), many contaminated sediments exist for which the methods can not adequately identify the cause(s) of toxicity. Standard WS-TIE methods primarily manipulate the toxicity of dissolved contaminants, but do not address effects that may occur via dietary exposure to chemical contaminants. The research presented herein, recognises that standard WS-TIE methods do not address all of the major contaminant exposure pathways for some benthic organisms. New WSTIE methods to address toxic effects of those contaminants acting via dietary exposure routes were developed as a part of this research. The new methods were specifically designed for whole-sediment toxicity tests using the epibenthic amphipod M. plumulosa; a deposit feeding species that can display acute toxicity from dietary exposure to contaminated sediments (Simpson and King, 2005; Mann and Hyne, 2008; Spadaro et al., 2008). WS-TIE methods using the microalgae Entomoneis cf punctulata were also developed to compliment results achieved using Melita plumulosa in sediment quality assessments. New WS-TIE treatments were developed to modify the organism’s exposure to sediment contaminants by modifying the bioaccessibility of particulate-associated contaminants (PACs) to M. plumulosa. The two new techniques were principally employed to achieve this goal. Firstly, a mesh exposure chamber (MEC) was developed that effectively prevented M. plumulosa from ingesting sediments, but did not modify the exposure to dissolved contaminants in the overlying water. Secondly, resins deployed at the sediment surface, metal chelating resin-top (MCR-Top) or carbonaceous adsorbent resin-top (CAR-Top) to both remove from the dissolved phase, metals and organic contaminants, respectively. It was demonstrated that sediment nutrition had a large influence on the outcome of whole-sediments toxicity tests, and a food addition (FOOD) treatment was incorporated into the suite of WS-TIE treatments to help differentiate between the natural effects caused by nutritionally-poor sediments and the toxic effects of dietary exposure to contaminants. For the amphipod M. plumulosa, the standard WS-TIE methods were demonstrated to be ineffective for reducing, or eliminating, the toxicity of a range of sediments. For ~ 80 % of the sediments investigated, > 50 % of the toxicity to M. plumulosa was unaccounted for using standard WS-TIE methods. By applying the new WS-TIE treatments in combination with the standard WS-TIE methods, > 90 % of toxicity could be identified for each of the sediments. For almost half these sediments, PACs were considered to have significantly contributed to toxicity (50 - 100 %). Additionally, new WS-TIE treatments were able to improve the identification of dissolved metals and hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs), when compared to standard WS-TIE methods alone. The application of both standard and new WS-TIE methods identified dissolved metals and HOCs as the chief causes of toxicity to M. plumulosa in ten sediments containing a wide range of contaminants. Apparent toxicity due to inadequate sediment nutrition was demonstrated to confound the interpretation of the WS-TIE studies. It was found to be beneficial to apply a ‘minimal’ feeding regime, comprising approximately 0. 06 mg fish-food per amphipod on days 3 and 7 of 10 -d toxicity tests, to ensure that a lack of nutrition did not cause toxic effects in sediments containing low nutritional value (e. g. sandy sediments with low amount of organic matter). Sediments that contained ≥ 10 % fine particles (silt, 2 % organic carbon were determined to have adequate nutrition and FOOD treatments were unnecessary. The addition of the FOOD treatment in WS-TIEs was generally a useful tool for discerning poor nutrition from toxicity to M. plumulosa. However, in applying a FOOD treatment to WS-TIEs, it was observed that selective feeding could mask the toxic effects of some contaminants, namely hydrophobic organic chemicals. Therefore, the FOOD treatment was used cautiously to discern poor nutrition from toxicity using additional lines-of evidence, such as knowledge of changes to the organism’s sensitivity to contaminants and contaminant concentration-effect relationships. For the microalgae, E. cf punctulata, for which the only significant contaminant exposure pathway {{is believed to be the}} passive diffusion of dissolved contaminants or their free ions across the cell surface, a rapid WS-TIE method based on FDA fluorescence inhibition in E. cf punctulata using flow cytometry was developed for dissolved metals (metal chelating resin, MCRx, treatment), organic contaminants (carbonacsous adsorbent resin, CAR, treatment), and ammonia (zeolite, ZEO, treatment). These treatments were effective for reducing the toxicity of contaminants in both natural -contaminated and spiked-sediments. The identification of all the chemical toxicants within contaminated sediments was generally found to be very difficult. The variability between replicates was usually high, ranging from 0 - 19 % (amphipod survival). The use of a multiple lines-of-evidence approach with WS-TIE is recommended for sediments containing a wide variety of chemical contaminants. The lines-of-evidence used to enhance the understanding of toxicants in the sediments of this study included: (i) chemical analyses of the test waters, (ii) analyses of physical/chemical properties of the sediment (i. e. total particulate metals and acid extractable metals, organic contaminants, sediment fractionation, total organic carbon, etc), (iii) understanding of the organisms contaminant-exposure pathways, (iv) quantifying the role of nutrition to sediment toxicity (i. e. silt and TOC content), (v) measuring the effects of added food on organism sensitivity, contaminant bioavailability, feeding behaviour or physiology (i. e. depuration and detoxification processes), and (vi) understanding the physiology and behaviour of the organism, and the factors that may have significant effects. In order to strengthen the lines-of-evidence for interpreting WS-TIE data, contaminant concentration-effect relationships were determined for contaminants often observed in sediments. For M plumulosa, the 10 -d EC 50 for dissolved <b>un-ionised</b> <b>ammonia,</b> copper, and zinc were 980, 75, and 220 μg/L, respectively. The IC 50 values for dissolved copper and zinc to E. cf punctulata were 13 μg/L and 1, 500 μg/L, respectively. The ICx and ECx values were used to determine the specific contaminant(s) causing toxicity and/or the contribution of these contaminants to observed toxic effects in sediments containing a mixture of contaminants. The effect of contaminants on the growth of M. plumulosa, and the ability of WS-TIE methods to determine which stressors were the causes of any growth effects, was assessed. Results from the natural-contaminated sediments and the chemical-spiked sediments demonstrated that the growth, measured as amphipod size (area), was a more sensitive indicator of toxicity than acute survival. However, WS-TIE methods were far less effective for identifying toxicity using amphipod growth than survival. Difficulties with applying a growth toxicity indicator using M. plumulosa arose from the significant influence of sediments physico-chemical properties, storage and handling of sediment and feeding regime during whole-sediment toxicity tests...|$|E
