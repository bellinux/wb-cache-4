50|$|Couch Flambeau {{was formed}} by two Greendale, WI High School friends, guitarist Jay Tiller and drummer Ron Faiola (a.k.a. Ron Ford/Giant Wow) in 1980. Their first shows were {{in the fall of}} 1981 at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukees dormitories under <b>the</b> name <b>Couch</b> Potatoes. For these shows, Tiller and Faiola would wear pyjamas and paper bags over their heads while playing early {{versions}} of songs that ended <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>Couch</b> Potatoes release, Curiosity Rocks.|$|R
60|$|When the freedman {{had ceased}} speaking, Vetranio sat <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> {{called for a}} basin of water, dipped his fingers in the {{refreshing}} liquid, dried them abstractedly on the long silky curls of the singing-boy who stood beside him, gazed about him once more, repeated interrogatively the word 'daybreak', and sunk gently back upon his couch. We are grieved to confess it--but {{the author of the}} Nightingale Sauce was moderately inebriated.|$|E
60|$|Hither Olaf and Snorro {{were brought}} by their captors, and {{immediately}} conveyed {{to the tent}} of the chief, who was an aged and white-haired though vigorous and strong-boned savage. Whitepow, for such, curiously enough, was his name, opened his eyes uncommonly wide {{when he saw the}} children of the Norsemen, and, sitting <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> of furs on which he had been reclining, gazed at them for about five minutes without speaking, almost without winking.|$|E
60|$|Oh, {{when our}} very hearts burn for justice, how little {{do we know}} how {{intolerable}} would be the sight of it! Tom's caution and readiness returned as soon as--after a somewhat long interval--he began to distinguish the voices round him, and perceive the amazement he had created. Before {{he was able to}} sit <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> where he had been laid {{out of sight of the}} scene which had affected him so strongly, he was urging his friend to set down all that had been spoken, and on Gaspard's writing a separate deposition. The pocket-book, and other effects, were readily ceded to the British authority, and were carried away with them.|$|E

Back at home, {{the three of them}} seem to get along well, until Brenda moves to sit on their new white couch while drinking wine and later on wants to sleep on it while wearing a green beauty mask on her face. Mitch and Cameron let her sleep on their bed while they sleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> living room floor, but Brenda ends <b>up</b> sleeping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> anyway.|$|R

50|$|A {{music video}} was {{released}} for <b>the</b> song <b>on</b> 20 January 2012 with Nina Nesbitt and currently has over 84 million views <b>on</b> YouTube. <b>The</b> video, {{written and directed}} by Saman Kesh, starts with Sheeran coming home and sitting down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> depressed. As he opens a can of beer, he notices his cat talking to him. Together they drink beer and do various activities, and later they go to a pub. Sheeran and his cat are kicked out when a person takes a photo of Sheeran and his cat starts a fight with that person. They bring several women and cats home to party and Sheeran starts hallucinating from his intoxication. The video ends with Sheeran waking <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>couch</b> with his cat next to him and a can of beer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. Throughout the video, Sheeran continues to have flashbacks of a particular woman and looks depressed immediately after, implying that she is Sheeran's ex-girlfriend who recently broke up with him.|$|R
60|$|A ray of sunlight, fitful and struggling, burst at {{this moment}} through the heavy clouds, and stole into {{the opening of the}} tent as he {{contemplated}} the slumbering girl. It ran its flowing course up her uncovered hand and arm, flew over her bosom and neck, and bathed in a bright fresh glow, her still and reposing features. Gradually her limbs began to move, her lips parted gently and half smiled, as if in welcome to the greeting of the light; her eyes slightly opened, then dazzled by the brightness that flowed through their raised lids, tremblingly closed again. At length thoroughly awakened, she shaded her face with her hands, and sitting <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> met the gaze of Hermanric fixed on her in sorrowful examination.|$|E
60|$|The {{end of the}} {{nightmare}} was not altogether according to Inspector Jacks' expectations. He {{found himself in a}} small back room, stretched upon a sofa before the open French-windows, through which came a pleasant vision of waving green trees and a pleasanter stream of fresh air. His first instinct was to sniff, and a sense of relief crept through him when he realized that this room, at any rate, was free from abnormal odors. He sat <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> A pale-faced Japanese servant stood by his side with a glass in his hand. A few feet away, the man whom he had come to visit was looking down upon him with an expression of grave concern in his kindly face.|$|E
6000|$|The way {{in which}} the Sea Lady talked to Mrs. Bunting on that memorable morning, when she lay all wet and still visibly fishy on the couch in Mrs. Bunting's dressing-room, I am also able to give with some little fulness, because Mrs. Bunting {{repeated}} it all several times, acting the more dramatic speeches in it, to my cousin Melville in several of those good long talks that both of them in those happy days--and particularly Mrs. Bunting--always enjoyed so much. And with her very first speech, it seems, the Sea Lady took her line straight to Mrs. Bunting's generous managing heart. She sat <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> drew the antimacassar modestly over her deformity, and sometimes looking sweetly down and sometimes openly and trustfully into Mrs. Bunting's face, and speaking in a soft clear grammatical manner that stamped her at once as no mere mermaid but a finished fine Sea Lady, she [...] "made a clean breast of it," [...] as Mrs. Bunting said, and [...] "fully and frankly" [...] placed herself in Mrs. Bunting's hands.|$|E
50|$|Cookie {{is walking}} through the unit quietly, as not to wake <b>up</b> Buggy asleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> trying to change her sheets after she wet the bed. Gun shots go off and Buggy wakes up panicked calling out for his mom. He asks Cookie to hand him his bag and he takes out a bottle of pills which he can’t open, so Cookie opens it. They begin to talk and Cookie tells Buggy {{she wants to be}} a rapper and a flight {{attendant}} when she is grown up. Buggy shares his night terror with Cookie and that his friend, a Lieutenant, died.|$|R
5000|$|Billy shoots {{his first}} setup with Gabriel, the Lancaster-Kerr kiss. Following the shoot, Gabriel tells Billy that his {{relationship}} with Natalie is over. Billy mentions <b>the</b> Kinsey scale, <b>on</b> which Billy {{describes himself as a}} [...] "perfect six," [...] but Gabriel admits he does not know where <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scale he falls. Back at Billy's apartment, they continue to talk and drink and Gabriel asks if he can spend <b>the</b> night <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> Billy suggests that Gabriel sleep in his bed (ostensibly because of Gabriel's height), to which Gabriel eventually agrees. When the two are in bed, Billy makes tentative overtures, to which Gabriel seems to respond initially; however, Gabriel suddenly pulls away, after which Billy apologizes and gets <b>up</b> to sleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b>|$|R

Richard tortures the group and kills Chrissy before he goes upstairs to kill some {{investigating}} police officers. Richard also explains {{the reason for the}} murders, revealing he had become obsessed with Trisha after raping her one night. Using this time to free himself, Matt stuns Richard and frees Trisha. However, Matt is killed doing this. Trisha manages run {{out of the house and}} retrieves Frank's gun which he stashed in Matt's truck. She shoots Richard several times, ensuring he is dead, and then walks away from the house into the surrounding woods.|$|R
60|$|The same {{thought had}} crossed the surgeon's mind. He grasped the wounded lip with his forceps, and with two swift cuts {{he took out a}} broad V-shaped piece. The woman sprang <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> with a dreadful gurgling scream. Her {{covering}} was torn from her face. It was a face that he knew. In spite of that protruding upper lip and that slobber of blood, it was a face that he knew, She kept on putting her hand up to the gap and screaming. Douglas Stone sat down {{at the foot of the}} couch with his knife and his forceps. The room was whirling round, and he had felt something go like a ripping seam behind his ear. A bystander would have said that his face was the more ghastly of the two. As in a dream, or as if he had been looking at something at the play, he was conscious that the Turk's hair and beard lay upon the table, and that Lord Sannox was leaning against the wall with his hand to his side, laughing silently. The screams had died away now, and the dreadful head had dropped back again upon the pillow, but Douglas Stone still sat motionless, and Lord Sannox still chuckled quietly to himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{people up}} in the north there. You see--in this dream, anyhow--I had been a big man, {{the sort of man}} men come to trust in, to group {{themselves}} about. Millions of men who had never seen me were ready to do things and risk things because of their confidence in me. I had been playing that game for years, that big laborious game, that vague, monstrous political game amidst intrigues and betrayals, speech and agitation. It was a vast weltering world, and at last I had a sort of leadership against the Gang-- you know it was called the Gang--a sort of compromise of scoundrelly projects and base ambitions and vast public emotional stupidities and catch-words--the Gang that kept the world noisy and blind year by year, and all the while that it was drifting, drifting towards infinite disaster. But I can't expect you to understand the shades and complications of the year--the year something or other ahead. I had it all--down to the smallest details--in my dream. I suppose I had been dreaming of it before I awoke, and the fading outline of some queer new development I had imagined still hung about me as I rubbed my eyes. It was some grubby affair that made me thank God for the sunlight. I sat <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and remained looking at the woman, and rejoicing--rejoicing that I had come away out of all that tumult and folly and violence before it was too late. After all, I thought, this is life--love and beauty, desire and delight, are they not worth all those dismal struggles for vague, gigantic ends? And I blamed myself for having ever sought to be a leader when I might have given my days to love. But then, thought I, if I had not spent my early days sternly and austerely, I might have wasted myself upon vain and worthless women, and at the thought all my being went out in love and tenderness to my dear mistress, my dear lady, who had come at last and compelled me--compelled me by her invincible charm for me--to lay that life aside.|$|E

5000|$|The oversexed Fairy Godmother then {{keeps the}} Wolf busy. She appears before {{him in an}} old-fashioned 1890s {{swimsuit}} ("Miss Repulsive 1898") and then an evening gown before trying to snuggle <b>up</b> to him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> She chases him all around Cinderella's house, but the Wolf escapes when he gets the Fairy Godmother's wand, turning Cinderella's bathtub into a convertible. He leaves for the nightclub where Cinderella is performing, with the Fairy Godmother in pursuit. Soon after arriving, the Wolf accidentally kisses the Fairy Godmother, thinking she was Cinderella, which only further deepens her lust for the Wolf. Cinderella soon comes out on-stage and performs an exotic dance while singing the song [...] "Oh Wolfie" [...] (to the tune of [...] "Oh Johnny, Oh Johnny, Oh!"). The Wolf howls and chases after Cinderella, but the smitten Godmother uses various methods (usually a mallet) {{to keep him in}} line.|$|R
5000|$|Slate writer Hanna Rosin has {{praised the}} show in {{particular}} for slowly subverting the sitcom archetype of the father incompetent at managing the household. Chris started out as an idiot who stayed home with the baby because he had nothing better to do. In early episodes, he propped <b>up</b> <b>the</b> infant <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> so he could play his video games or watch hockey, and didnt really notice when she tipped over. But over time he has morphed into the sane, sensible parent {{we all want to}} be. Now his role is to check his wifes crazy competitive instincts and to never renege on a promise made to his daughter. In fact, the shows main innovation is creating a reliable stay-at-home dad whose wife still wants to sleep with him. The show then went further, she recalled, by then assigning the usual role of a sitcom dad to Reagan. [...] "She turned into a version of Ralph Kramden, prone to tantrums and meddling," [...] Rosin writes. [...] "Like the classic doltish dad, she creates elaborate schemes to fix domestic problems but only winds up making everything worse. And then Chris swoops in, Alice-style, to make it all better." ...|$|R
50|$|Beavis and Butt-Head wake <b>up</b> after napping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> {{and find}} a rat causing havoc in their house and eating their nachos.

Eventually they set it with a corn chip as bait and return to <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> Butt-Head sends Beavis to check <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trap, but Beavis falls for the bait and traps himself again. Later, they hear a noise in the kitchen and find the rat trapped, but still alive. Butt-head sweeps the rat towards Beavis, who accidentally releases it from the trap. The rat is grateful and follows Beavis in admiration. The pair go to work at Burger World, with the rat in tow. Beavis lets the rat work in the kitchen with him, and takes it out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tray when a woman orders. She is shocked and calls the manager, who is angry with Beavis and Butt-Head. As the rat went missing while they were being told off, they search around for it. Later, {{it turns out that the}} rat was pregnant and it gives birth to a litter of babies in the restaurant, possibly leading to an infestation.|$|R

50|$|Whilst not an {{acknowledged}} {{remake of}} the 1974 film directed by Robert Altman, Mississippi Grind has some commonalities with California Split. Both films open at a poker table with neither character knowing the other. The second scene for both films {{takes place in a}} dark bar where both characters bump into each other and proceed to get inebriated. One character ends <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other's <b>couch</b> in scene 3 and is late for work, the other is reading the form guide with a female friend. One of the main characters is working full time, the other not. The working character (played by George Segal in California Split and Ben Mendelsohn in Mississippi Grind) both films leaves work early to attend a racetrack with the other. In scene 5, they win the first bet they place at the track (and this is the only bet they place that we actually see in both films). Both films contain a scene where the main character(s) are held up in a parking lot. Both workers have debts with bookmakers they cannot repay (with scenes taking place in cafes to discuss repayments). There is basketball hustler scene. The worker ends the movie with a feeling of emptiness despite winning big in the final scene. They attend both horse tracks and greyhounds tracks (the latter only spoken about in California Split). Both working characters have dalliances with prostitutes. The working character is desperate in the lead-up to the final scene, only to secure an unbeatable streak gambling. Both characters, to the despair of the non-working character (played by Elliott Gould in California Split and Ryan Reynolds in Mississippi Grind), part ways {{at the end of the}} film.|$|R
