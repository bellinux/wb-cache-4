40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} methodology used in Down syndrome screening and in particular estimating Down syndrome risks. The thesis focuses on practical issues concerning the way laboratory measurements are standardised to provide multiples of the median (MoMs) for use in screening. Aims of this thesis • To undertake a comparative review of the established methods commonly employed to fit regression models for use in standardising measures, taking the standard statistical method as a gold standard. The established methodology for doing this has developed {{over a number of years}} by medical workers and it departs from the standard statistical approach. This work involves a historical review of the use of multiples of the medians for standardising measurements and of the so called 'median regression'. The theoretical properties of these methods are investigated (Chapter 2). • To explain the effect of different policies for <b>updating</b> <b>medians</b> on the distribution of log(multiples of the medians). Two aspects are considered. Firstly, the effect of different methods for calculating MoMs on the estimation of distributional parameters of the log transformed multiples of the medians for the α-fetoprotein analyte, (log(MoM(AFP))), (Chapter 3) and secondly, the effect of different methods for calculating MoMs on individual risks (Chapter 4). • To investigate the effect a change to an estimated standard deviation of the distribution of log(MoM(analyte)) has on the size of risk (Chapter 4). • To design a method to continuously monitor the log(MoM(AFP)) for changes in their medians. In the procedure for calculating the risk of a woman having a down syndrome pregnancy, it is impossible to control all the factors so there will always be an associated error. A method of continuously monitoring the log(MoM(AFP)) using cumulative frequency charts is illustrated, and we also show how this method can be used to <b>update</b> <b>medians</b> effectively (Chapter 5). The data used in this thesis Our study sample consisted of 9587 women who attended Servizio Nazional Clinic, Regione Peimonte, Italy, for their antenatal care during the whole of 1996.

Economic viability of reforestation under payment per hectare and payment per tonne schemes for carbon sequestration was assessed in a region in southern Australia supporting 6. 1 Mha of rain-fed agriculture. The results show that under the <b>median</b> <b>scenario,</b> a carbon price of 27 A$/tCO 2 -e could make one-third {{of the study area}} (nearly 2 Mha) more profitable for reforestation than agriculture, and at 58 A$/tCO 2 -e all of the study area could become more profitable.

Pareto-optimal land allocation could realize one-third of the potential carbon sequestration from reforestation (16. 35 MtCO 2 -e/yr at a carbon risk factor of 0. 8) with a loss of less than one-tenth (107. 89 A$M/yr) of the agricultural production.

Therefore a failure to consider the potential impact of climate change on municipal buildings would be both costly and detrimental to sustainable development. In this paper the authors present research undertaken to ascertain the potential impacts of climate impacts on municipal buildings in South Africa. A two-phase approach was adopted. Firstly the appropriate climate effects on a given building inventory, in a selected location, were determined; then the cost impacts on that building (based on a set of stressor-response functions) were applied. The results of the study predict that the total impact of climate change on buildings in South Africa could vary between USD $ 42. 7 million average annual costs in the <b>median</b> <b>scenario</b> and USD $ 214. 3 million average annual costs in the maximum scenario. The results presented are all incurred costs, which need to be addressed to avoid health and safety issues. However costs would be much higher if the existing stock was augmented without considering climate change impacts. The research provides an understanding of the cost of climate change and how the maintenance and adaptation of the unsustainable buildings may divert resources from sustainable development. The results of the research may also present an opportunity for existing buildings to be retrofitted with alternative, sustainable technologies, which serve to decrease vulnerability to climate change impacts going forward...|$|R

In this paper, the “world insurance growth curve” is {{used in conjunction with}} estimates of China's future GDP growth to estimate the growth and size of China's insurance industry for the period 2006 – 2020. There are clearly other factors – social, political, cultural, demographic and market structure – that also have an impact, but other empirical {{studies have shown that the}} key factor in the long term is growth and development of the overall economy. Assuming that China's GDP grows over that period at a rate of 6 – 9 percent per year, we conclude that the possible range of China's insurance industry growth rate would be 7. 7 – 17. 9 percent, with a more likely range of 9. 8 – 14. 8 percent.

Especially European beech strongly reacts on climate scenarios with positive deviations up to 2 m 3 ·ha– 1 ·yr– 1 as well as negative values down to – 3 m 3 ·ha– 1 ·yr– 1 in the third period. (3) Basically, the positive effect of climate change in the first period diminishes over time and even turns negative in many cases. While the deviation in periodic volume increment of Scots pine shows only a few small negative values in the third period, periodic volume increment of oak is negatively affected by climate change in Uelzen entirely but not so much in Fläming. The climate effect on periodic volume increment of European beech shows a disparate picture over time with positive tendencies under minimum and <b>median</b> climate <b>scenario</b> in Uelzen and a clearly negative trend under median and maximum climate scenario in Fläming. (4) Scots pine is the least sensitive species, both positive and negative. Climate change has the strongest impact on European beech with the most positive deviations in Fläming in the first period and the most negative deviations in Uelzen and Fläming in the third period. Oak takes on an intermediate position looking at the deviations in periodic volume increment.

In Fläming the periodic volume increment of both species shows more positive reactions in the first period and under <b>median</b> and maximum <b>scenario</b> significant negative deviations in the third period.

However, the ability of markets to motivate the supply of carbon sequestration and biodiversity services from agricultural land is uncertain, especially given the future changes in environmental, economic, and social drivers. We quantified the potential supply of these services from the intensive agricultural land of Australia from 2013 to 2050 under four global outlooks {{in response to a}} carbon price and biodiversity payment scheme. Each global outlook specified emissions pathways, climate, food demand, energy price, and carbon price modeled using the Global Integrated Assessment Model (GIAM). Using a simplified version of the Land Use Trade-Offs (LUTO) model, economic returns to agriculture, carbon plantings, and environmental plantings were calculated each year. The supply of carbon sequestration and biodiversity services was then quantified given potential land use change under each global outlook, and the sensitivity of the results to key parameters was assessed. We found that carbon supply curves were similar across global outlooks. Sharp increases in carbon sequestration supply occurred at carbon prices exceeding 50 $ tCO(2) (- 1) in 2015 and exceeding 65 $ tCO(2) (- 1) in 2050. Based on GIAM-modeled carbon prices, little carbon sequestration was expected at 2015 under any global outlook. However, at 2050 expected carbon supply under each outlook differed markedly, ranging from 0 to 189 MtCO(2) yr(- 1). Biodiversity services of 3. 32 % of the maximum may be achieved in 2050 for a 1 $B investment under <b>median</b> <b>scenario</b> settings. We conclude that a carbon market can motivate supply of substantial carbon sequestration but only modest amounts of biodiversity services from agricultural land. A complementary biodiversity payment can synergistically increase the supply of biodiversity services but will not provide much additional carbon sequestration. The results were sensitive to global drivers, especially the carbon price, and the domestic drivers of adoption hurdle rate and agricultural productivity. The results can inform the design of an effective national policy and institutional portfolio addressing the dual objectives of climate change and biodiversity conservation that is robust to future uncertainty in both national and global drivers.

30|$|As {{indicated}} in the previous section, it appears that only one study has been conducted so far that makes a comprehensive investigation of historical production data and resources/reserves data {{for each type of}} non-conventional gas resources that of Wang et al. (2016 c). Based on these data, Wang et al. (2016 c) also carried out what we believe was the first quantitative study of China’s long-term non-conventional gas production. This used the geologic resources supply–demand model (GeRS–DeMo), which is a widely used model for developing the projections of non-conventional fossil fuel production (Mohr and Evans 2010, 2011; Wang et al. 2015). Wang et al. (2016 c) develop three scenarios based on different URR assumptions. These are a high scenario (where TRR is treated as the URR), a low scenario (where “cumulative production plus reserves” is used as the URR), and a <b>median</b> <b>scenario</b> (which uses the average of these high and low URRs). It should be noted that resource availability is the only factor considered in Wang et al. (2016 c). The potential constraints from environmental issues are not included. Taking shale gas as an example, extracting shale gas may result in many environmental problems, including methane emissions, water use, water pollution, and induced earthquakes (Howarth and Ingraffea 2011; Entrekin et al. 2011; Frohlich 2012). Among these, water issues may be the most significant constraining factor for China shale’s gas development. Hydraulic fracking is usually needed in extracting shale gas resources due to their low permeability, which will consume large amounts of pressurized water. Generally, one shale gas well will use more than 20 thousand cubic metres water, and large-scale development of shale gas will surely have serious impacts on local water resources (Jiang et al. 2014; Hu et al. 2013 a, b). However, China itself is facing serious water shortage issues (Zhu et al. 2001), which means that local water availability will be an important constraint for shale gas development. In a report released by the World Resources Institute, China is labelled as “high” average exposure to water stress over its shale gas and shale oil area (Reig et al. 2014). Therefore, if other constrained factors are considered, the forecast results of Wang et al. (2016 c) should be seen as the upper bound of the future production and that the actual production will very likely be lower than results shown in Wang et al. (2016 c).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the current study on the impact of climate change on the road and building infrastructure within South Africa. The approach builds upon previous work associated with the UNU-WIDER Development under Climate Change effort emphasizing the impact of climate change on roads. The paper illustrates how climate change effects on both road and building structures can be evaluated with the application of a new analysis system - the infrastructure planning support system. The results of the study indicate that the national level climate change cost impact in South Africa will vary between US$ 141. 0 million average annual costs in the <b>median</b> climate <b>scenario</b> under an adaptation policy, and US$ 210. 0 million average annual costs under a no adaptation scenario. Similarly, the costs will vary between US$ 457. 0 million average annual costs in the maximum climate scenario under an adaptation policy scenario, and US$ 522. 0 million average annual costs under a no adaptation scenario.

40|$|The {{numerical}} simulation {{of the motion}} of Rhone's glacier in the Swiss Alps is performed from 1874 to 2007, and then from 2007 to 2100. Given {{the shape of the}} glacier, the velocity of ice u is obtained by solving a 3 D nonlinear Stokes problem. Then, the shape of the glacier is updated by computing the volume fraction of ice ϕ, which satisfies the transport equation ∂ϕ／∂t +u · ∇ϕ = bδΓA. Here bδΓA is a source term acting only on the ice-air interface ΓA which accounts for the accumulation or ablation of ice due to snow falls or melting. A decoupling algorithm allows the two above problems to be solved using different numerical techniques. The nonlinear Stokes problem is solved on a fixed, unstructured finite element mesh made of tetrahedrons. The transport equation is solved using a fixed, structured grid made of smaller cells. The {{numerical simulation}} is performed between 1874 and 2007. Then, a <b>median</b> climatic <b>scenario</b> is considered in order to predict the shape of the glacier from 2007 until 2100.

40|$|Background: The phase III TRIBE study met {{its primary}} {{endpoint}} by demonstrating that first-line FOLFOXIRI plus bev significantly prolongs PFS, {{as compared to}} FOLFIRI plus bev (Loupakis et al, N Eng J Med 2014). At a median follow-up of 32. 2 months a preliminary OS analysis indicated a borderline OS improvement with FOLFOXIRI plus bev (HR = 0. 79, p = 0. 054) with a consistent effect across RAS (KRAS and NRAS codons 12, 13, 61) and BRAFV 600 E molecular subgroups. Methods: 508 pts were randomized to either FOLFIRI plus bev (Arm A, N = 256) or FOLFOXIRI plus bev (Arm B, N = 252). On available samples from RAS and BRAF wild-type (wt) pts (N = 129), also KRAS and NRAS codons 59, 117 and 146 were analysed by means of Sequenom MassArray, identifying a new ???all wt??? population (N = 93). Results: At a median follow-up of 48. 1 months, in the ITT population, <b>updated</b> <b>median</b> OS for Arm B vs Arm A was 29. 8 vs 25. 8 months (HR = 0. 80, 95 %CI, 0. 65 - 0. 98, p = 0. 030). Estimated 5 -years OS rate were: Arm B, 24. 9 % vs Arm A, 12. 4 %. Molecular results were informative for 357 pts (70. 3 %). All wt patients had longer OS as compared to RAS mutant (HR = 0. 70, p = 0. 006) and to BRAF mutant (HR = 0. 24, p < 0. 001). The benefit from FOLFOXIRI plus bev was consistent across all molecular subgroups (Table 1). All wt pts treated with FOLFOXIRI plus bev reported a median OS of 41. 7 months as compared to 33. 5 months in the FOLFIRI plus bev group (HR = 0. 75, 95 %CI, 0. 45 - 1. 24). Conclusions: FOLFOXIRI plus bev significantly improves survival of metastatic colorectal cancer pts and the OS advantage increases over time. Benefit from FOLFOXIRI plus bev is independent of RAS and BRAF mutational status. All wt pts have a better outcome independently from the treatment arm. Notable results with FOLFOXIRI plus bev are achieved in all wt pts.

40|$|The African Development Bank {{has called}} for $ 40 Billion USD per year over the coming decades to be {{provided}} to African countries to address development issues directly related to climate change. The current study addresses {{a key component of}} these issues, the effect of climate change on the road infrastructure of Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia. The study incorporates a stressor-response approach to estimate the effects of projected precipitation, temperature, and flooding changes on the paved and unpaved road infrastructure of these countries. The paper highlights the result of running 425 climate scenarios for each road type and policy option from 2010 to 2050. Based on this broad analysis, it is estimated that the three southern African countries are facing a potential $ 596 million price tag based on <b>median</b> climate <b>scenarios</b> to maintain and repair roads as a result of damages directly related to temperature and precipitation changes from potential climate change through 2050. The challenge for policy makers is to determine the potential risk that a country is facing based on the uncertainties associated with the multiple aspects of climate change modeling.

40|$|The Canadian prairie {{provinces of}} Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta have {{reported}} the highest human incidence of clinical cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in Canada. The primary vector for WVN {{in this region}} is the mosquito Culex tarsalis. This study used constructed models and biological thresholds to predict the spatial and temporal distribution of Cx. tarsalis and WNV infection rate in the prairie provinces under a range of potential future climate and habitat conditions. We selected one median and two extreme outcome scenarios to represent future climate conditions in the 2020 (2010 – 2039), 2050 (2040 – 2069) and 2080 (2070 – 2099) time slices. In currently endemic regions, the projected WNV infection rate under the <b>median</b> outcome <b>scenario</b> in 2050 raised 17. 91 times (ranged from 1. 29 – 27. 45 times for all scenarios and time slices) comparing to current climate conditions. Seasonal availability of Cx. tarsalis infected with WNV extended from June to August to include May and September. Moreover, our models predicted northward range expansion for Cx. tarsalis (1. 06 – 2. 56 times the current geographic area) and WNV (1. 08 – 2. 34 times the current geographic area). These findings predict future public and animal health risk of WNV in the Canadian prairie provinces...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cochrane reviews are {{regarded}} as scientifically rigorous, yet a review’s time to publication can be affected by {{factors such as the}} statistical significance of the findings. When this happens, misrepresentation of the literature and subsequent inappropriate decisions may result. We aimed to examine the factors associated with the time to publication of Cochrane reviews. Methods: Review protocols published in issue 2, 2000, of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were includ-ed in this analysis if the corresponding review was published by issue 1, 2008. We used univariable and multivariate analyses to examine the time from publication of the protocol to publication of the first review and review-related factors predicting the time to publication. Results: Of 118 eligible protocols published in issue 2, 2000, we identified 93 Cochrane reviews that had been pub-lished by January 2008. Of these, 36 (39 %) were <b>updates.</b> The <b>median</b> time to publication was 1. 63 years (range 0. 15 – 7. 31 years). A change in authors between publication of the protocol and publication of the final review was associated with longer time to publication (p = 0. 002), whereas updated reviews were associated with shorter time to publication (p = 0. 030). Interpretation: In our study, 79 % of the Cochrane protocols were published as a final review, and some Cochran...|$|R
40|$|Background: Among {{patients}} in skilled nursing facilities for post-acute care, increased registered nurse, total licensed staff, and nurse assistant staffing {{is associated with}} a decreased rate of hospital transfer for selected diagnoses. However, the cost-effectiveness of increasing staffing to recommended levels is unknown. Methods: Using a Markov cohort simulation, we estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of recommended staffing versus median staffing in patients admitted to skilled nursing facilities for post-acute care. The outcomes of interest were life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness of recommended staffing versus median staffing was $ 321, 000 per discounted quality-adjusted life year gained. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness ratio was most sensitive to the likelihood of acute hospitalization from the nursing home. The cost-effectiveness ratio was also sensitive to the rapidity with which {{patients in}} the recommended staffing scenario recovered health-related quality of life as compared to the <b>median</b> staffing <b>scenario.</b> The cost-effectiveness ratio was not sensitive to other parameters. Conclusion: Adopting recommended nurse staffing for short-stay nursing home patients cannot be justified on the basis of decreased hospital transfer rates alone, except in facilities with high baseline hospital transfer rates. Increasing nurse staffing would be justified if health-related quality of life of nursing home patients improved substantially from greater nurse and nurse assistant presence...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the security and adequacy of the Ontario Electricity System for the 10 -year period from 2003 to 2012. This assessment is based on forecasts of electricity demand and available supply combined with current information on the configuration and capability of the transmission system. Based on existing and proposed facilities, Ontario is expected to have a reliable supply of electricity during the forecast period under a wide-variety of conditions. Opportunities also exist for additional enhancements to improve the efficiency of the Ontario electricity market. The assessments in this report were made based on a number of key planning assumptions. Assuming a <b>median</b> growth <b>scenario,</b> the energy demand is forecast to grow over the study period from 151 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2003 to 164 TWh in 2012, at an average annual growth rate of 0. 9 %. Peak demands are forecast to increase from about 24, 000 MW in 2003 to 26, 000 MW in 2012 at an average annual growth rate of 0. 9 %. Under normal weather conditions, Ontario is expected to be summer peaking by 2008. However, given the high variability of summer peak demands, {{there is a possibility that}} actual summer peaks may be higher than the winter peaks in some or all of the years before 2008, as has been the case in the recent past.

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} the median estimation {{problem in a}} large-scale sensor augmented RFID system. The large-scale deployment of RFID technology has {{opened the door to}} innovative ways to integrate RFID and sensor technology. Sensor-tags are tags that can report over 50 types of physical information to a reader. The traditional way to obtain information from sensor-tags is to query each tag. When the number of tags is large, however, it is prohibitive to query tags individually due to the high delay. In this paper, we present a probabilistic algorithm to estimate the median of a set of sensor-RFID tags without individually querying each tag. The median estimation problem is solved using binary search. Our evaluation demonstrates that the median search algorithm exhibits high accuracy and reasonable time latency. Moreover, we also design an exact algorithm for the continuous <b>median</b> <b>update</b> problem. Our algorithm can incrementally compute the exact median in less time...|$|R
