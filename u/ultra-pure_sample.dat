40|$|In {{this report}} we {{demonstrate}} the second known example whereby multiwalled carbon nanotubes {{made by the}} chemical vapour deposition method (cvd-MWCNTs) contain copper oxide nanoparticles within them which {{are responsible for the}} analytical signal observed, in this example the electrochemical detection of glucose. Comparisons with copper(II) oxide particles immobilised onto a basal-plane pyrolytic graphite electrode produce almost identical voltammetric responses as the cvd-MWCNTs. Similar experiments performed using an edge-plane pyrolytic graphite electrode and with an <b>ultra-pure</b> <b>sample</b> of arc-MWCNTs (made using the electric arc discharge method and free from any residual metal nanoparticle catalysts) demonstrates that these electrode substrates are inactive towards even high concentrations of glucose. Thus the edge-plane-like defects present at the termini of the graphite sheets or the ends of the MWCNTs are not, as is usually the case, the electroactive sites towards this particular analyte. It is the copper impurities which are the electroactive species responsible and MWCNTs should not be considered as suitable substrates for the electrochemical detection of glucose contrary to numerous previous claims except in so far as they provide an elegant, if adventitious, method for "wiring" copper oxide nanoparticles. © 2008 Elsevier B.

This transition shows a strong anisotropy in the applied field {{direction with the}} critical field H_c ranging from ∼ 5. 1 T for H c to ∼ 8 T for H∥ c.

Based on a microscopic tight-binding model, we introduce the metamagnetic transition by means of a van Hove singularity scenario. We show that the rotation of the O-octahedra around the c-axis expected for this material introduces a staggered spin-orbit coupling within the planes and naturally leads to an anisotropy of the magnetic response. We describe the low-temperature phase as a nematic state favored by forward scattering processes. The spin-orbit coupling shows an influence on both, the critical field H_c and the occurrence of the nematic phase...|$|R

40|$|Background: Homeopathy is a time-tested two-century old {{empirical}} {{system of}} healing. Homeopathic medicines are prepared through a characteristic {{process known as}} potentization, where serial dilutions are performed with strong strokes at each step of dilution. Homeopathy is controversial because most medicines do not contain one single molecule of the corresponding starting-substance. Aim: To investigate a possible nanoscience mechanism of action of homeopathic medicines. Methodology: <b>Ultra-pure</b> <b>samples</b> were prepared and were examined under scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) along with selected area nanodiffraction (SAD) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Also trace element analysis (TEA) for silicon was performed. Results: Homeopathic medicines showed not to be Ã¢â‚¬ËœnothingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, but exhibited nanoparticles and conglomerates of them, which had crystalline nature and were rich in silicon. Conclusions: During the violent strokes involved in potentization, information arising from the serially diluted starting-substance might be encrypted by epitaxy on silicon-rich crystalline nanoparticles present in the resulting homeopathic medicine. The Ã¢â‚¬ËœsizeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of the information encrypted on nanoparticles might vary together with the degree of dilution. As homeopathic medicines exhibit healing effects, these nanoparticles along with the interfacial water on their surface might carry this information - which biological systems are able to identify - to the target. As various forms of silica are known to interact with proteins and cells of the immune system, homeopathy might represent a nanomedicine system. Possible confirmation, however, requires further research in materials and interfacial water...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the formalism for a molecular orbital treatment of resistivity in metals. The molecular orbital property that controls resistivity is electron {{orbital angular momentum}} as a property of conducting electrons. The model is a direct extension of partial wave scattering of electrons in atoms. This produces a model that improves qualitative predictive capacity for resistance related properties, such as, comparative resistivity of conduction bands {{as a function of}} temperature, and the pattern of superconductivity at one bar in the periodic table. For the purpose of direct comparison of resistivity for crystalline elements we re-introduce atomic-resistivity, a volumetric property of atoms. This change is needed to develop a clear understanding of the periodic, molecular orbital and chemical physical causes of resistivity. Thinking about atomic resistivity leads directly to a phenomenological picture of resistivity based upon electronnuclear scattering. This picture is simply a variation on the picture of interactions between conducting electrons and atomic cores in a metal lattice. The mathematical formalism for partial wave scattering of electrons from atomic quantum mechanics, generates the wellknown low temperature T 2 dependence of resistivity, when the conduction band has p basis functions. The quadratic dependence of resistivity on absolute temperature is known experimentally and is a feature of the Bloch-Grüneisen model. Use of electron orbital angular momentum in polyatomic molecular orbitals is well known and straightforward. Electron orbital angular momentum in the conducting band is essential for understanding partial wave scattering, one of the main sources of resistivity in metals. The partial wave scattering model accounts for the zero slope as a function of T for resistivity of <b>ultra-pure</b> <b>samples</b> of copper at low temperatures. The model presented here is qualitative. A basis is presented that should lead to resistivity calculations in the near future. The new model properly anticipates that the limiting resistivity for copper at low temperatures has zero slope. ...|$|R

40|$|The Electron Capture in 163 Ho experiment, ECHo, is {{designed}} to investigate the electron neutrino mass in the sub-eV range {{by means of the}} analysis of the calorimetrically measured spectrum following the electron capture (EC) in 163 Ho. Arrays of low-temperature metallic magnetic calorimeters (MMCs), read-out by microwave SQUID multiplexing, will be used in this experiment. With a first MMC prototype having the 163 Ho source ion-implanted into the absorber, we performed the first high energy resolution measurement of the EC spectrum, which demonstrated the feasibility of such an experiment. In addition to the technological challenges for the development of MMC arrays, which preserve the single pixel performance in terms of energy resolution and bandwidth, the success of the experiment relies on the availability of large <b>ultra-pure</b> 163 Ho <b>samples,</b> on the precise description of the expected spectrum, and on the identification and reduction of background.

Precision measurements of the kinematics of weak interactions, {{in particular}} of the 3 H β-decay and the 163 Ho electron capture (EC), represent the only model independent approach to determine the absolute scale of neutrino masses. The electron capture in 163 Ho experiment, ECHo, is designed to reach sub-eV sensitivity on the electron neutrino mass by means of the analysis of the calorimetrically measured electron capture spectrum of the nuclide 163 Ho. The maximum energy available for this decay, about 2. 8 [*]keV, constrains the type of detectors that can be used. Arrays of low temperature metallic magnetic calorimeters (MMCs) are being developed to measure the 163 Ho EC spectrum with energy resolution below 3 [*]eV FWHM and with a time resolution below 1 [*]μs. To achieve the sub-eV sensitivity on the electron neutrino mass, together with the detector optimization, the availability of large <b>ultra-pure</b> 163 Ho <b>samples,</b> the identification and suppression of background sources as well as the precise parametrization of the 163 Ho EC spectrum are of utmost importance.

40|$|NASA's Genesis Mission {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral in August of 2001 {{with the goal}} of collecting solar wind in <b>ultra-pure</b> materials. The <b>samples</b> were returned to Earth more than three years later for subsequent analysis. Although the solar wind is comprised primarily of protons, it also contains ionized species representing the entire periodic table. The Genesis mission took advantage of the natural momentum of these ionized species to implant themselves in specialized collectors including single crystal Si and SiC. The collectors trapped the solar wind species of interest and sustained significant damage to the surface crystal structure {{as a result of the}} ion bombardment. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry has been used to evaluate the extent of this damage in Si and SiC samples. These results and models are compared for artificially implanted samples and pristine non-flight material. In addition, the flown samples had accumulated a thin film of molecular contamination as a result of outgassing in flight, and we demonstrate that this layer can be differentiated from the material damage. In addition to collecting bulk solar wind samples (continuous exposure), the Genesis mission actually returned silicon exposed to four different solar wind regimes: bulk, high speed, low speed, and coronal mass ejections. Each of these solar wind regimes varies in energy, but may vary in composition as well. While determining the composition is a primary goal of the mission, we are also interested in the variation in depth and extent of the damage layer as a function of solar wind regime. Here, we examine flight Si from the bulk solar wind regime and compare the results to both pristine and artificially implanted Si. Finally, there were four samples which were mounted in an electrostatic "concentrator" designed to reject a large fraction (> 85 %) of incoming protons while enhancing the concentration of ions mass 4 - 28 amu by a factor of at least 20. Two of these samples were single crystal 6 H silicon carbide. (The others were polycrystalline CVD diamond and amorphous carbon that were not examined in the work.)
