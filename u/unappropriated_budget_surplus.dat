40|$|We analyze comovements in four {{measures}} of <b>budget</b> <b>surpluses</b> for 18 OECD countries for 1980 - 2008 with a dynamic latent factor model. The world factor in national <b>budget</b> <b>surpluses</b> declines substantially in the 1980 s, rises {{throughout much of}} the 1990 s to a peak in 2000, before declining again in the most recent period. This world factor explains {{a substantial portion of the}} variability in <b>budget</b> <b>surpluses</b> across countries. World factors in national output gaps, dividend-price ratios, and military spending significantly explain variation in the world <b>budget</b> <b>surplus</b> factor. The significant relationship between national output gaps and OECD {{measures of}} cyclically adjusted <b>budget</b> <b>surpluses</b> suggests that such cyclical measures inadequately adjust for the international business cycle. Sizable fluctuations in idiosyncratic components of national <b>budget</b> <b>surpluses</b> often readily relate to well known "unusual" country circumstances.

Population of this study consists of 13 districts/cities in Central Sulawesi and 11 districts/cities are selected as sample based on purposive sampling method. The research method used is verivication by means of multiple linear regressions analysis. The results of the test show that 50, 40 % of <b>budget</b> <b>surplus</b> is influenced by capital expenditure and good and service expenditure : while 49, 6 % is influenced by other factors, Multiple linear regression tests indicate that capital expenditure, good and service expenditures simultaneously and partially have significant influence on <b>budget</b> <b>surplus</b> in districts/cities in Central Sulawesi...|$|R

40|$|This paper tests Barro's (1979) tax-smoothing {{hypothesis}} using Swedish {{central government}} {{data for the}} period 1952 - 1999. According to the tax-smoothing hypothesis, the government sets the <b>budget</b> <b>surplus</b> equal to expected changes in government expenditure. When expenditure is expected to increase, the government runs a <b>budget</b> <b>surplus,</b> and when expenditure is expected to fall, the government runs a budget deficit.

Well, President Clinton's plan is even worse. In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton offered his proposal for "saving" Social Security by "committing " 60 percent of projected government <b>budget</b> <b>surpluses</b> for the next 15 years to that purpose. This was widely, and wildly, hailed as the right thing to do. But does it make any sense? The president's plan relies critically on several unexamined assumptions. Most obviously, it relies on <b>budget</b> <b>surpluses</b> far into the future. The plan would "transfer " more than $ 2. 7 trillion from projected general <b>budget</b> <b>surpluses</b> to the Social Security Trust Fund over the next 15 years. The president's unbounded optimism allowed him to claim, "We are on a course for <b>budget</b> <b>surpluses</b> for the next 25 years, " but our nation has never —let me repeat, never—run <b>budget</b> <b>surpluses</b> for such a period.

40|$|Aided {{by strong}} {{economic}} growth the Singapore {{government has been}} able to keep both the tax rate and the government expenditure rate low and yet generate healthy <b>budget</b> <b>surpluses</b> year after year. Although the gap between the tax rate and the government expenditure rate is the obvious source of the surplus, this paper shows the presence of another subtle source, a surplus generated by conservative growth forecasts that lay the base for revenue projections. An omitted variable bias in a model based on the tax smoothing hypothesis led us to consider the role played by the growth forecast error in predicting the <b>budget</b> <b>surplus.</b> Our computations show that on average the underprediction of the tax base (GDP) must have contributed about $ 376 million per year to the realized <b>budget</b> <b>surplus</b> over the period 1990 - 2005. This appears to be simply a byproduct of the Government’s philosophy of “fiscal prudence”. Tax smoothing model, Reported and adjusted <b>budget</b> <b>surplus,</b> GDP forecast errors. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of large <b>budget</b> <b>surpluses</b> in 2000 {{and the first}} half of 2001 dramatically altered perceptions of fiscal policy. Now, the surplus has all but disappeared {{in the wake of the}} economic slowdown. Monetary policy, based on lower interest rates, seems to be having little impact on spending and gives the appearance of “pushing on a string. ”In this environment expansionary fiscal policy becomes the most effective way to stimulate demand. Yet, the case for expansionary fiscal policy remains hobbled by the mistaken conventional wisdom which has for so long pushed for <b>budget</b> <b>surpluses.</b> And even if the dire nature of the situation successfully compels a temporary fiscal expansion, there will remain a danger of deflationary <b>budget</b> <b>surplus</b> economics re-asserting itself the moment recovery becomes visible. For this reason, the current moment provides a critical opportunity to examine the economics of <b>budget</b> <b>surpluses.</b> Our momentary flirtation with surpluses and the prospect of paying down the national debt revealed that persistent surpluses are highly problematic. This makes a non-sense of the existing fiscal paradigm. Government debt plays an important constructive role in modern economies, and the debt should therefore grow with economic activity. This requires government deficits. Rathe...|$|R
