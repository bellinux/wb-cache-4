25|$|The 2/14th and 2/16th Battalions slept {{where they}} {{fell on the}} trail {{on the night of}} 8 September, but managed to re-unite with Potts and 21st Brigade {{headquarters}} at Menari the next day. The 2/27th Battalion was unable to reach the village before the rest of the brigade was again forced to retreat by the advancing Japanese. Menari was extremely exposed to observation from further <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> and the village was already under barrage from Japanese artillery and light machine guns by the time the first 2/16th troops arrived. Potts waited for the 2/27th until 2.30 pm, then gave orders to abandon Menari. The 2/27th and their cargo of wounded from the other battalions were forced to follow paths parallel to the main trail, but eventually rejoined the main Australian force at Jawarere.|$|E
25|$|In New Westminster, Governor Seymour, {{just a month}} {{into his}} term, {{received}} news of the attacks on May 14. The next day Chartres Brew and 28 men were sent to Bute Inlet aboard HMS Forward but {{they were unable to}} make their way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> from the Homathko valley {{to the scene of the}} incident and returned to New Westminster. A second party of 50 men under Gold Commissioner William Cox went to the area using an overland route, met an ambush and retreated. Brew, aboard HMS Sutlej, along with the Governor and 38 men went out again to reach the Chilcoltin from Bentinck Arm. They arrived July 7 and met Cox. Donald McLean led a scouting party to reconnoiter. A guide, hearing a rifle click, urged him to get down. He didn't and was shot through the heart.|$|E
25|$|In the aftermath, US forces {{estimated}} {{that they had}} come up against a Japanese force of around company strength. The Japanese positions were very extensive and well organized, with numerous machine gun positions and many dugouts that were deep with good overhead cover. Although a careful count of Japanese dead was not taken, at least 40 Japanese bodies were recovered. Six Japanese machine guns were captured. The Marine forces lost 20 killed, including five officers, and 39 wounded. Although not provided for {{in the first phase}} of the battle when Company E advanced <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> artillery preparation was later recognized as of prime importance against the Japanese system of defenses, with their well dug-in, concealed, and covered foxholes, equipped with a high percentage of automatic weapons, in turn covered by equally invisible riflemen in trees and spider-hole. Without strong fire support, severe losses would have been sustained by the attacking Marines.|$|E

25|$|At about 6:30 in {{the morning}} of December 2, the Americans {{advanced}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> but were met with a steady volley of fire, resulting in them only being able to climb around 300 feet. The Americans abandoned the idea of a frontal assault and took cover in the zigzag trail. Texan sharpshooters stationed themselves on a hill overlooking the trenches and proceeded to whittle down the Philippine rear guard with measured volleys. Nevertheless, the Filipinos continued to hold their ground, utilizing focused volley fire that repelled other advances by the Americans. Therefore, March sent elements of their force with an Igorot villager named Januario Galut to determine the Filipino positions and outflank the defenders. While the flanking movement was still in progress, three American soldiers rushed to the battlefield but found themselves receiving Filipino fire. Two died, being the only Americans killed in the encounter, while the third was badly wounded.|$|E
500|$|Thru-hikers are {{classified}} into many informal groups.

500|$|The {{engineer}} company {{started its}} attack {{up the mountain}} about noon of September 4, following a trail up a southern spur. The 1st Platoon was in the lead, single file, followed by the 2nd and 3rd Platoons. Palmer considered the mission so important {{that he and his}} military intelligence officer, Captain Rene J. Guiraud, accompanied the engineers. Platoon Sergeant James N. Vandygriff, 2nd Platoon, D Company, in a brief conversation with Holley as he went ahead of the latter on his way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> said he thought the attack was a [...] "suicide mission".|$|E

500|$|Meeker {{had long}} {{contemplated}} {{the idea of}} marking the Oregon Trail, over which he had traveled in 1852, with granite monuments. By the early 20th century, {{he was convinced that}} the Trail was in danger of being forgotten. Farmers were plowing <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trail</b> bit by bit, and as towns and cities grew along it, the Trail vanished under streets and buildings. [...] Meeker viewed its preservation as an urgent matter because of this slow disappearance. [...] He wanted the Trail properly marked, and monuments erected to honor the dead.|$|E
500|$|Less than [...] <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> D Company {{came under}} machine gun fire from its right flank, which inflicted several casualties. Kennedy {{rejected}} Vandygriff's request {{to take a}} squad and knock out the gun, so the file got past {{the line of fire}} as best it could until M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle fire from the 3rd Platoon silenced the weapon. Farther <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> another North Korean machine gun fired from the right along the trail and held up the advance until US artillery fire silenced it. The file of men left the trail-like road, which dead-ended, dropped over into a ravine on the left, and continued the climb. North Korean mortar fire killed two men and wounded eight or ten others in this phase of the ascent. At this time the 2nd Platoon leader collapsed from a kidney ailment and command passed to Vandygriff. Vandygriff led his platoon, now {{at the head of the}} company, on up the gully and at about 17:00, came through a tunnel under a small ridge and the stone wall into the bowl-shaped summit of Hill 755, the southern arm of the Hill 902 crest. The 2nd and 3rd Platoons soon arrived, in that order. Near the top, Palmer received radio orders from Gay to come off the mountain; Gay had not known that Palmer had accompanied the attack.|$|E
500|$|The next morning, September 4, D Company {{received}} {{orders to}} move immediately as an infantry force to Ka-san. The company carried no rations since E Company, 8th Cavalry, {{was to bring}} food and water later.

Sniper fire came in on the men as they moved <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> to the base of Ka-san's steep slope. Word was given to the company that there were about 75 disorganized North Korean troops on Ka-san. But actually, during the afternoon and evening of September 3, the NK 2nd Battalion, 2nd Regiment, 1st Division, had occupied the summit of Ka-san.|$|E

500|$|The day before, E Company {{had been}} delayed in {{following}} D Company to Hill 755. Soon after the Engineer company had started <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> on September 4, E Company arrived at Holley's command {{post at the}} base of the mountain. North Korean mortar fire was falling on the trail at the time and the company commander said he could not advance because of it. Holley radioed this information to Palmer who designated another company commander. This second officer was soon wounded in the leg and Holley then designated a third officer, who started up the mountain with E Company that evening about 20:00. North Korean fire stopped the company [...] short of the crest before dawn. It was this same company that the NK 13th Division had cut off when it launched its attack the evening of September 2 and overran the 2nd Battalion north of Tabu-dong. Tired and dispirited from this experience and their roundabout journey to rejoin the regiment, E Company men were suffering from lowered morale.|$|E
500|$|The {{most popular}} hiking trail {{approach}} to the summit is via the [...] Tuckerman Ravine Trail.

Other routes up the eastern slopes of the mountain include the Lion Head, Boott Spur, Huntington Ravine and Nelson Crag trails, as well as the Great Gulf Trail ascending from the northeast. Routes from the western slopes include the Ammonoosuc Ravine and Jewell trails and the Crawford Path and Gulfside Trail (coincident with the Appalachian Trail from the southwest and from the north, respectively).|$|E
500|$|Colonel Raymond D. Palmer, {{commanding}} the 8th Cavalry Regiment {{was ordered to}} retake the mountain {{with the help of}} several support units.
