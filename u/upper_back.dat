5|$|Disorders of the maxillary sinus can be {{referred}} to the <b>upper</b> <b>back</b> teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the <b>upper</b> <b>back</b> teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and neoplasms of the sinus (such as adenoid cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or tilting the head forward.|$|E

5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren {{is notable}} for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown, ear tufts and <b>upper</b> <b>back</b> are prominently featured in breeding displays. The male in breeding plumage has a silvery blue crown, ear coverts and <b>upper</b> <b>back,</b> a black throat and nape, bright red-brown shoulders, a long grey-brown tail and wings, and greyish-white belly. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour, though males may retain traces of blue and black plumage. All males have a black bill and lores (eye-ring and bare skin between eyes and bill), while females have a black bill, rufous lores and pale grey eye-ring. Immature males will develop black lores by six weeks of age and generally moult into an incomplete breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching. This has a patchy or spotty appearance, {{with a mixture of}} blue and grey feathers on the head, and black and grey on the breast; birds born early in the breeding season will gain more nuptial plumage initially than those born late. Most perfect their nuptial moult by their second spring, though some may need another year. Several males have been observed in breeding plumage in a single group at the same time, although it is unknown if or how this is related to dominance or breeding status.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban macaw had a red {{forehead}} fading {{to orange}} {{and then to}} yellow {{at the nape of}} the neck. It had white unfeathered areas around the eyes, and yellow irises. The face, chin, chest, abdomen and thighs were orange. The legs were brown. The <b>upper</b> <b>back</b> was brownish red with feathers scalloped with green. The rump, undertail feathers, and lower back were blue. The wing feathers were brown, red and purplish blue. The upper surface of the tail was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface of the tail was brownish red. The beak has variously been described as dark, all-black, and greyish black. The sexes were identical in external appearance, as with other macaws.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies, S. c. carolinensis, has pale blue-gray upperparts, a glossy black cap (crown of the head), {{and a black}} band on the <b>upper</b> <b>back.</b> The wing coverts and flight feathers are very dark gray with paler fringes, and the closed wing is pale gray and black, with a thin white wing bar. The face and the underparts are white. The outer tail feathers are black with broad diagonal white bands across the outer three feathers, a feature readily visible in flight.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Upper</b> Newport <b>Back</b> Bay boasts {{one of the}} few {{remaining}} natural estuaries in Southern California. Living in the waters of the <b>Upper</b> Newport <b>Back</b> Bay, are several diverse species of plankton and algae. These plankton and algae act as a food source for the eighty or so species of fish that live in the estuary. The topsmelt, anchovy, and mullet are especially common in the area, feeding on the abundant population of plankton and detritus. Along with a multitude of fish, plankton, and algae, a number of invertebrates occupy the marine zone of the <b>Upper</b> Newport <b>Back</b> Bay. The most common invertebrates that can be found in the <b>Upper</b> Newport <b>Back</b> Bay are worms, molluscs, and crustaceans. Molluscs found in the bay are likely to harbor hurtful micro-organisms and bacteria, therefore human consumption of mussels, clams, and snails found in the bay are forbidden from human consumption. Some of the molluscs that can be found in the <b>Upper</b> Newport <b>Back</b> Bay are California jackknife clam, the bent-nosed clam, the ribbed horse mussel, lined shore crabs, fiddler crabs, mud crabs, swimming crabs, skeleton shrimp, ghost shrimp, and the California horn snail.|$|R

5|$|The {{subspecies}} avicenniae {{differs from}} the nominate by its smaller size. It also varies as its nape to back is a dull grey colour. The brown spot present {{at the back of}} the head of the nominate is also reduced or gone. The lower back is toned a slight olive, and the underparts are also slightly paler than the nominate, but without white feathers. Avicenniaes upper wing-coverts are also more greenish-grey. The similar but smaller rufous-necked wood rail can be differentiated from the grey-necked wood rail by the former's reddish head and neck with a grey <b>upper</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
5|$|Crosses that precede an {{offensive}} bicycle kick are of dubious accuracy—German striker Klaus Fischer reportedly stated that most crosses {{prior to a}} bicycle kick are bad. Moreover, performing a bicycle kick is dangerous, even when done correctly, as it may harm a startled participant in the field. For this reason, Peruvian defender César González recommends that the player executing the bicycle kick have enough space to perform it. For the player using the manoeuvre, the greatest danger happens during the drop; a bad fall can injure the head, back, or wrist. Witzig recommends players attempting the move to land on their <b>upper</b> <b>back,</b> using their arms as support, and simultaneously rolling over to a side in order to diminish impact from the drop. A poor bicycle kick can also expose a player to ridicule.|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the <b>upper</b> <b>back</b> teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E

5|$|Strasburg {{signed a}} 7-year, $175 million {{extension}} {{to remain with}} the Nationals. With the extension, Strasburg became the first National to receive an opt-out clause in his contract, which allows him to elect free agency after the 2019 or 2020 seasons if he desires. On June 26, 2016, he {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list due to an <b>upper</b> <b>back</b> strain. He returned on July 3 against the Cincinnati Reds, where he took a no-hitter through 6.2 innings until being lifted from the game after throwing 109 pitches. The no-hitter was broken up in the 8th inning, but the Nationals still won 12-1. On July 8, Strasburg became the first pitcher since 1912 to start 12-0. His streak of consecutive wins ran to 16, including 13 decisions in the 2016 season, before it was snapped by the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 21. On August 22, Strasburg was again placed on the 15-day disabled list due to right elbow soreness.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{the house}} sparrow is mostly {{different}} shades of grey and brown. The sexes exhibit strong dimorphism: the female is mostly buffish above and below, while the male has boldly coloured head markings, a reddish back, and grey underparts. The male has a dark grey crown {{from the top of}} its bill to its back, and chestnut brown flanking its crown on the sides of its head. It has black around its bill, on its throat, and on the spaces between its bill and eyes (lores). It has a small white stripe between the lores and crown and small white spots immediately behind the eyes (postoculars), with black patches below and above them. The underparts are pale grey or white, as are the cheeks, ear coverts, and stripes {{at the base of the}} head. The <b>upper</b> <b>back</b> and mantle are a warm brown, with broad black streaks, while the lower back, rump and uppertail coverts are greyish brown.|$|E
5|$|The red-winged fairywren (Malurus elegans) is {{a species}} of {{passerine}} bird in the family Maluridae. It is sedentary and endemic to the southwestern corner of Western Australia. Exhibiting {{a high degree of}} sexual dimorphism, the male adopts a brilliantly coloured breeding plumage, with an iridescent silvery-blue crown, ear coverts and <b>upper</b> <b>back,</b> red shoulders, contrasting with a black throat, grey-brown tail and wings and pale underparts. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles have predominantly grey-brown plumage, though males may bear isolated blue and black feathers. No separate subspecies are recognised. Similar in appearance and closely related to the variegated fairywren (M. lamberti) and the blue-breasted fairywren (M. pulcherrimus), it is regarded as a separate species as no intermediate forms have been recorded where ranges overlap. Though the red-winged fairywren is locally common, there is evidence of a decline in numbers.|$|E

5|$|Åkerman {{was raised}} a Buddhist, which {{inspired}} the lotus flower tattoo on her <b>upper</b> <b>back.</b> She {{also has a}} tattooed 'Z' on her right wrist, honouring her husband, Italian musician Roberto Zincone. The two met in 2003 when Åkerman was the lead singer for The Petalstones, for which Zincone served as the drummer. After band practices, they usually socialized, using a dictionary as he could not speak English. They eventually started dating and married at Grand Hotel Moon Valley in Sorrento, Italy on June 20, 2007. Every year, they used to spend their holidays in Naples, Zincone's native city. The couple had one son, Sebastian Zincone, born on April 16, 2013. On November 25, 2013, the couple announced that they were separating. Zincone filed for divorce on December 2, 2013.|$|E
5|$|The right heart {{collects}} deoxygenated {{blood from}} two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects {{in the right}} and left atrium continuously. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties into the <b>upper</b> <b>back</b> part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and {{to the middle of the}} opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.|$|E
