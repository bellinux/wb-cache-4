5|$|As of 2014, {{there are}} 102khutors in the republic, mostly found in three areas: {{to the north}} of Maykop; in the northeast, along the Laba River; and in the {{predominantly}} aul zone {{in the western part of}} the republic. Each <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> a population of between one and five hundred, although some exceed one thousand. Together they account for 44.9% of the republic's rural localities, but only for 15% of the rural population. In 1926, the populations in 4% of the khutors exceeded five hundred; by 2000, this had risen to 18%.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium is {{estimated}} to make up about 5.8 ppm of the Earth's upper crust by mass. It does not exist as a free element on Earth, but is found combined in solid solution with zirconium in natural zirconium compounds such as zircon, ZrSiO4, which <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> about 1–4% of the Zr replaced by Hf. Rarely, the Hf/Zr ratio increases during crystallization to give the isostructural mineral hafnon (Hf,Zr)SiO4, with atomic Hf > Zr. An old (obsolete) name {{for a variety of}} zircon containing unusually high Hf content is alvite.|$|E

5|$|In June 2007, SDSU {{was deemed}} {{the number one}} small {{research}} university in the nation. The ranking was determined based on faculty productivity, honorary awards, publications in journals, and number of research grants received. At any point, the campus <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> around 800 studies in progress in various fields. A 2007 study revealed that the campus has an economic impact of $2.4 billion on the San Diego region. Due to projections of current and future growth, the study indicated that the school's economic impact {{is expected to increase}} to $4.5 billion by 2025.|$|E
5|$|NASA began a {{tradition}} of playing music to astronauts during the Gemini program, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts' families, and <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish may be {{purchased}} pre-soaked into a hard sponge, {{which can be}} used to buff leather without needing to apply any additional polish to either the leather or the sponge. This is usually known as an applicator. A number of companies that manufacture shoe care products also sell a liquid shoe polish in a squeezable plastic bottle, with a small sponge applicator at the end. To decrease its viscosity, bottled polish <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> a very low wax content.|$|E
50|$|The Pentatomoidea are {{characterized}} by a well-developed scutellum (the hardened extension of the thorax over the abdomen). It can be triangular to semielliptical in shape. Pentatomoidea species <b>usually</b> <b>have</b> antennae with five segments. The tarsi <b>usually</b> <b>have</b> two or three segments.|$|R
50|$|Supernumerary roots is a {{condition}} found in teeth {{there may be a}} larger number of roots than expected. The most common teeth affected are mandibular (lower) canines, premolars, and molars, especially third molars. Canines and most premolars, except for maxillary (upper) first premolars, <b>usually</b> <b>have</b> one root. Maxillary first premolars and mandibular molars <b>usually</b> <b>have</b> two roots. Maxillary molars <b>usually</b> <b>have</b> three roots. When an extra root is found on any of these teeth, the root is described as a supernumerary root.|$|R

5|$|Spotted hyenas {{dominate}} other hyena species wherever their ranges overlap. Brown hyenas encounter spotted hyenas in the Kalahari, {{where the}} brown species outnumbers the spotted. The two species typically encounter {{each other on}} carcasses, which the larger spotted species usually appropriate. Sometimes, brown hyenas will stand their ground and raise their manes while emitting growls. This <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> the effect of seemingly confusing spotted hyenas, which will act bewildered, though they will occasionally attack and maul their smaller cousins. Similar interactions have been recorded between spotted and striped hyenas in the Serengeti.|$|E
5|$|The American Airlines Arena <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> a {{capacity}} of 19,600, which was reduced for Survivor Series due to production purposes. From an approximate attendance of 12,000 and 341,000 pay-per-view buys, Survivor Series helped WWE earn $19.9 million in pay-per-view revenue versus $18.7 million the previous year; this was confirmed by WWE in its 2007 fourth quarter financial report. Although Survivor Series helped WWE's revenue, it earned 42,000 less buys than the previous year's Survivor Series.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} is {{distinguished}} from the black-throated loon (G. arctica) and the red-throated loon (G. stellata) mainly by its larger size. It <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is heavier and the back is paler than its hindneck. It {{is more difficult to}} separate from the yellow-billed loon, but its breeding plumage has more white markings on the neck and the squares on its shoulders are usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more sharply with pale areas and bill colour.|$|E

5|$|The pigeye shark can be most {{reliably}} {{distinguished from}} the bull shark {{by the number of}} precaudal (before the caudal fin) vertebrae (89–95 in C. amboinensis versus 101–123 in C. leucas). Externally, it has a greater size difference between its dorsal fins (first-to-second height ratio >3.1:1 versus ≤3.1:1 in C. leucas) and the notch in its anal fin margin forms an acute angle (versus a right angle in C. leucas). This species also <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> fewer tooth rows in the lower jaw (10–12 on each side versus 12–13 in C. leucas).|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> a {{symbiotic}} relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on its left valve. This is most often the orange Myxilla incrustans but is sometimes the purple or brown Mycale adherens. The sponge provides camouflage for the scallop and may deter predators from attacking it as sponges often produce a repulsive odour and tend to be distasteful. It also {{makes it more difficult}} for a starfish to get the strong grip with its tube feet that it needs to force the two valves of the scallop apart.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} californicus <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> {{a longer}} bill {{compared to the}} nominate, and has brown-grey inner primaries during the breeding season. When not breeding, the nominate has diffuse and pale lores less often than Podiceps nigricollis californicus. The other subspecies, P. n. gurneyi, is {{the smallest of the}} three subspecies, in addition to having a greyer head and upper parts. The adult of this subspecies also has a rufous-brown tinge on its lesser wing-coverts. It also lacks a non-breeding plumage, in addition to the tufts on the side of its head being paler.|$|E

5|$|A single plant {{discovered}} by Nelson near Israelite Bay, where both putative parents are found, {{is regarded as}} a hybrid between A.cuneatus and A.dobsonii. Leaves are mostly triangular like those of A.cuneatus, but whereas A.cuneatus leaves are mostly five-lobed, the putative hybrid <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> three lobes, with the occasional leaf being entire like those of A.dobsonii (though A.cuneatis itself occasionally bears entire leaves). Leaves of the putative hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A.cuneatus, being bright green with a sparse indumentum like that of A.dobsonii. Flower colour is like that of A.cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum, like A.dobsonii.|$|E
5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E
5|$|Although cadmium <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> an {{oxidation}} state of +2, it also {{exists in the}} +1 state. Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, in {{that they do not}} have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common {{oxidation state}}s. Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous cadmium oxide (CdO); the crystalline form of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated, similar to zinc oxide. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid dissolve cadmium by forming cadmium chloride (CdCl2), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4), or cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2). The oxidation state +1 can be produced by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and aluminium chloride, forming the Cd22+ cation, which is similar to the Hg22+ cation in mercury(I) chloride.|$|E

5|$|Birds are {{tetrapods}} {{but though}} their hind limbs {{are used for}} walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight. Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.|$|E
5|$|F-Zero is {{a futuristic}} racing video game {{franchise}} originally created by Nintendo EAD {{and has been}} continually published by Nintendo although the company has let outside development houses work on some installments. The series premiered in Japan on November 21, 1990, with , which later was released in the North American (August 1991) and PAL (1992) regions. An original installment has appeared on nearly every succeeding Nintendo video game console and handheld {{with the exception of}} the Game Boy Color, Wii, and Nintendo DS. Excluding Japan, the series <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> landed on a video game system once in its lifetime. F-Zero: GP Legend marks the first time the franchise has hit a gaming system twice in its lifetime in the United States. Currently the series includes eight released video games, a television series, and video game soundtracks released on audio CDs. F-Zero and F-Zero X were re-released for the Virtual Console service through software emulation.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus volemus {{is closely}} related to L.corrugis, and {{generally}} similar in appearance. L.corrugis <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> more surface wrinkles, darker gills, weaker or absent scent, and less orange colouration; however, intermediate colour forms can be found. The two can be distinguished more definitively by microscopic characteristics: L.corrugis has larger spores—typically 10.4–12.8 by 9.6–11.8µm—with a coarser surface reticulum, and larger pleurocystidia. The species Lactifluus austrovolemus {{is closely related}}, but has more crowded gills, while L.lamprocystidiatus can only be reliably distinguished from L.volemus by microscopic characteristics: the reticulations on its spores are taller and more acute, and the meshes formed by the intersections of the reticulations are smaller. Both L.austrovolemus and L.lamprocystidiatus are known only from Papua New Guinea. Lactifluus hygrophoroides also resembles L.volemus, but differs in having widely spaced gills, and spores that lack surface reticulations.|$|E

Four-wheel {{vehicles}} are set up like normal cars or similarly to three-wheeled vehicles with the two rear wheels close together.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were many}} visible {{differences}} between the inmates of the Hospital General and the paupers who received bread. The most obvious is that most recipients of bread were in their prime years of age, unlike the majority percentage of elderly in the Hospital.
