A/S <b>unsaponifiable</b> residues were also tested separately at concentrations of 3. 3, 6. 6 and 10 microg/ml. All A/S <b>unsaponifiable</b> mixtures reduced the spontaneous production of stromelysin, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) by chrondrocytes. At concentrations of 3. 3 and 6. 6 microg/ml, A/S residues, tested separately, were potent inhibitors of the production of IL- 8 and PGE 2. Nevertheless, only avocado residue inhibited IL- 6 production at these concentrations. A/S <b>unsaponifiable</b> mixtures had a more pronounced inhibitory effect on cytokine production than avocado or soybean residues added alone. As anticipated, IL- 1 beta induced a marked release of collagenase, stromelysin, IL- 6, IL- 8 and PGE 2. A/S <b>unsaponifiable</b> mixtures partially reversed the IL- 1 effects on chrondrocytes.

40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of dietary oils can modulate {{the incorporation of}} triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRL) into hepatocytes, thus affecting the atherogenicity of these particles. However, nothing {{is known about the}} effect of the <b>unsaponifiable</b> fraction of the oils. In the present study, we evaluated the influence of these components on the uptake of TRL by rat primary hepatocytes. TRL were isolated from human serum after the intake of meals enriched in high-oleic sunflower oil (HOSO), virgin olive oil (VOO) or VOO enriched in its own <b>unsaponifiable</b> fraction (EVO). HOSO and HOSO-TRL differed from VOO and EVO and their corresponding TRL in the composition of triacylglycerol molecular species and of the <b>unsaponifiable</b> fraction. Furthermore, the increase in the <b>unsaponifiable</b> fraction of VOO led to changes in the triacylglycerol molecular species in the EVO-TRL. On incubation with hepatocytes, HOSO-TRL were taken up at a faster rate than VOO-TRL or EVO-TRL. In addition, in comparison to VOO-TRL, HOSO-TRL increased the expression of mRNA for the LDL receptor-related protein receptor, which {{plays an important role in}} the internalisation of remnant lipoproteins. EVO-TRL also increased LDL receptor-related protein mRNA expression in comparison with VOO-TRL, but this change was not accompanied by a rise in the uptake rate, suggesting that the <b>unsaponifiable</b> fraction of VOO may inhibit LDL receptor-related protein expression or activity post-transcriptionally. In conclusion, TRL from dietary oils with differing triacylglycerol molecular species and <b>unsaponifiable</b> fraction content are taken up by liver cells at different rates, and this may be important in the atherogenicity of these particles. © The Authors 2006.

A reduction in <b>unsaponifiable</b> fraction of each oil and fat and its biodiesel was noted, {{as well as a}} reduction in the content of free steroids. The results showed that, compared to the sedimentation problem of steroids in biodiesel, some raw materials, such as chicken fat and babassu oil may be promising because they have low content and high reduction percentages of steroids when converted to biodiesel...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} dietary fats on the serum cholesterol concentration has been discussed. In {{a series of}} experiments, conditions have been created under which rats can be induced to imitate humans in this respect. Using the rat as an experimental animal, the hypocholesterolaemic property of dietary sunflower seed oil has been investigated by the chemical and physical fractionation of this oil. By feeding the saponifiable and <b>unsaponifiable</b> matter of the sunflower seed oil, {{it was found that}} the latter fraction was partly responsible for the serum regulating property of this oil. This finding was confirmed by altering the composition of the <b>unsaponifiable</b> matter by the physical fractionation process of liquid propane segregation. Several fractions of oils with similar fatty acid compositions but differing in both quality and quantity of the <b>unsaponifiable</b> matter were found to have different effects on the serum cholesterol level...|$|R
