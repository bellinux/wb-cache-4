50|$|A {{recent review}} by McDowell reveals that Herrnstein's {{original}} equation fails to accurately describe concurrent-schedule data under a substantial range of conditions.Three deviations from matching have been observed: <b>undermatching,</b> overmatching and bias. <b>Undermatching</b> {{means that the}} response proportions are less extreme than the law predicts. <b>Undermatching</b> can happen if subjects too often switch between the two response options, a tendency that may be strengthened by reinforcers that happen to occur just after a subject switches. A changeover delay {{may be used to}} reduce the effectiveness of such post-switch reinforcers; typically, this is a 1.5 second interval after a switch when no reinforcer is presented. Overmatching is the opposite of <b>undermatching,</b> and is less common. Here the subjects response proportions are more extreme than reinforcement proportions. Overmatching may occur if there is a penalty for switching. A final deviation is bias, which occurs when subjects spend more time on one alternative than the matching equation predicts. This may happen if a subject prefers a certain environment, area in a laboratory or method of responding.|$|E

40|$|The {{pathways}} {{to higher education}} have broadened to increase students who partake in postsecondary education, yet continuing social inequities persevere related to where students access these higher education opportunities. Persistent racial minority underrepresentation at selective institutions {{may be due to}} academic <b>undermatch</b> in the college choice process whereby students apply, are admitted, or attend institutions below their level of academic qualifications. Furthermore, it is unclear the extent to which access to school counseling programs influence <b>undermatch.</b> The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the pervasiveness of academic <b>undermatch,</b> and the relationship between high school counseling programs and students’ college choice. Guided by Bourdieu’s Social Reproduction Theory and Giddens’ Theory of Structuration, I used logistic regression and HGLM analyses for a nationally representative sample of 12, 940 students at 940 high schools. The unique longitudinal dataset drew from the High School Longitudinal Survey of 2009 (HSLS: 09), Barron’s Admissions Competitive Index, and IPEDS. Findings point to the pervasiveness of academic <b>undermatch</b> at the application, admission, and attendance stages in the college choice process. White students <b>undermatch</b> at higher rates than any of the other racial groups and Asian students <b>undermatch</b> the least. However, <b>undermatch</b> rates at community colleges reveal that not only do Hispanic students <b>undermatch</b> at the highest rates by institutional level, but their rates are more than one-and-a-half times higher than White students by institutional level. Thus, <b>undermatch</b> is a complex phenomenon, with important nuances across and within racial groups. Characteristics of school counseling programs predict <b>undermatch,</b> for example, the more hours counselors devote to college counseling preparation activities, the less likely their graduates are to <b>undermatch</b> at any stage in the college choice process. The findings suggest the need to implement high school strategies and counselor training to provide students with quality college counseling support. At the college level, higher education practitioners are encouraged to reflect on admissions practices regarding college outreach to recruit from more diverse high schools than the typical feeder networks. Implications for policy speak to expanding enrollment and revisiting goals to include access to resourced institutions. For P- 20 education, it is important to provide opportunities for students to attend the best matched institutions that will lead to their educational success...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Undermatching</b> is {{considered}} as a serious issue in higher education, and it is getting increased attention from education researchers and policymakers. <b>Undermatching</b> can affect long-term economic inequality and social mobility, and it can negatively affect college graduation rates. According to one view, minority and less-affluent students have substantially lower graduation rates and take longer on average to get degrees when they do stay in school. Low college graduation rates are {{a problem in the}} United States; one estimate is that fewer than 60% of high school graduates manage to earn a bachelor's degree, {{which is one of the}} worst completion rates of developed nations. The problem of undermatched students has attracted the attention of the executive branch. Proposals to reduce <b>undermatching</b> include making it easier to transfer between colleges, making financial aid policies more transparent, and helping students identify colleges that will challenge them academically, possibly by sending high-achieving low-income seniors an information packet about college choices. According to a report by NBC News in 2014, some elite colleges such as Williams strive actively to bring bright low-income students by supporting them financially but these colleges can find themselves pressed to make up the shortfall by seeking out more full-paying students; as a result, students at such colleges tend to be mostly affluent with some low-income students but few from the middle class, which reporter Nona Willis-Aronowitz described as a [...] "middle class squeeze".|$|E

40|$|Considerable Naval and {{industrial}} experience {{dating from the}} explosion bulge studies of Pellini and Hartbower in the early 1950 s has indicated the engineering utility of using weld metal having strength greater than the plates being joined (overmatching). This practice shields the weld region, which typically has lower toughness than the plate and is often the site of defects, from the high strains that develop during an overload. This practical advantage, coupled with the ease of achieving overmatch in lower strength steel alloys (80 ksi yield strength or less) has led to codification of overmatching as a requirement in most structural design codes and fabrication specifications. However, overmatching has certain economic and technical disadvantages which <b>undermatched</b> (weld metal strength less than plate strength) systems might alleviate. Examples of <b>undermatch</b> benefits discussed in the literature include reduction of the preheat needed to avoid hydrogen cracking and increase of weld metal deposition rate relative to overmatched practice. Such changes could reduce the need to hold electrodes at an elevated temperature prior to use, extend the welder's duty cycle, reduce the lack of fusion / lack of penetration defect rate, reduce restraint stresses, and increase weld metal toughness. This information suggests that overmatched welds, while quite effective for low strength steel construction, {{may not be as}} advantageous when fabricating structures from higher strength grades. However, <b>undermatched</b> welds cannot be immediately adopted for use due to the much greater strains {{that would have to be}} borne by the weld metal. <b>Undermatched</b> welds will require greater toughness to provide the same safety margin against fracture as overmatched construction. To quantify the toughness / matching combinations which provide acceptable service performance, information regarding how over and under matching influences the stresses and strains in a weld joint is needed. Additionally, procedures for quantifying the fracture toughness of candidate weld metals and their heat affected zones will be required.

Although longitudinal studies indicate that high-achieving low-income students have been underrepresented at selective colleges for decades, the <b>undermatching</b> phenomenon has recently gained the attention of those seeking to improve educational access and opportunity. ^ This study used case studies of three highly selective liberal arts colleges with need-blind admission policies to explore the institutional policies and practices that contribute to and limit admissions undermatch. Although there is considerable literature on the predictors of <b>undermatching</b> from the student perspective and the psychological, socioeconomic, and economic effects of why a student undermatches, there is less literature available on the institutional policies, practices, and pressures that may contribute to <b>undermatching.</b> Findings suggest that the three institutions studied are limiting admissions <b>undermatching</b> by expanding admission staff travel to identify low-SES students, developing partnerships with community-based organizations and foundations to influence low-SES student interest; and admitting, aiding and enrolling higher shares of low-SES students.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation into the effect of weld metal strength mis-match on the fracture behaviour of surface cracked tensile panels (CCT) and single edge notch bend (SENB) specimens. Two high-strength, low-allow steels were welded with one type of electrode to produce one <b>undermatched</b> (M= 0. 74) and one slightly overmatched (M= 1. 06) butt weld joints on these two base metals. Two crack sizes were used in two different locations, the weld metal and the heat affected zone (HAZ). The J integral measurements were made by instrumenting a contour on the tensile specimen with strain gauges. Tensile panel results revealed that if a defect exists in the <b>undermatched</b> weld, a combination of the low weld metal toughness and strain concentration in the weld metal lead to the poor fracture performance. Even a 6 percent overmatched weld provided an effective shielding to the small surface crack from applied plastic strains. This beneficial effect was pronounced particularly for small HAZ crack: This effect was, however, lost for large crack. In this paper, fracture parameters were discussed in terms of remote (base plate strain), local strain (of the region where a surface crack exists) and gauge length strain (GLS) to show the significance of applied strain definition on the fracture performance of mis-matched joints. Finally, the J design curve was applied and a good prediction was obtained if the local strain was used as applied strain. (orig.) Reprinted from: Mis-Matching of Welds, ESIS 17 (edited by K. H.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of low-income, high-achieving {{high school students in}} the U. S. either do not apply to college or <b>undermatch</b> by attending less selective institutions than those they are qualified to attend. Previous research has demonstrated that behavioral “nudges” can be an effective and low-cost method of influencing students’ application behavior and encouraging them to enroll in selective institutions. This study contributes to this existing body of literature by examining whether framing college earnings premium information as a loss causes low-income high school students in Chicago to report greater likelihood of applying to college than when the same information is framed as a gain. I find that there are {{no significant differences between the}} gain and loss conditions, but that students in both conditions report greater likelihood of applying to a highly selective college as compared to students in the control, where no earnings premium information was provided...|$|R
40|$|Attempts to {{characterize}} voluntary behavior have been ongoing {{for thousands of}} years. We provide experimental evidence that judgments of volition are based upon distributions of responses in relation to obtained rewards. Participants watched as responses, said {{to be made by}} “actors,” appeared on a computer screen. The participant's task was to estimate how well each actor represented the voluntary choices emitted by a real person. In actuality, all actors' responses were generated by algorithms based on Baum's (1979) generalized matching function. We systematically varied the exponent values (sensitivity parameter) of these algorithms: some actors matched response proportions to received reinforcer proportions, others overmatched (predominantly chose the highest-valued alternative), and yet others <b>undermatched</b> (chose relatively equally among the alternatives). In each of five experiments, we found that the matching actor's responses were judged most closely to approximate voluntary choice. We found also that judgments of high volition depended upon stochastic (or probabilistic) generation. Thus, stochastic responses that match reinforcer proportions best represent voluntary human choice...|$|R
