50|$|A fifteen-minute {{boat ride}} from Cannes, the Île de Sainte-Marguerite {{is low in}} profile and heavily wooded with <b>umbrella</b> <b>pines</b> and eucalyptus. Both islands (with the Île Saint-Honorat) are looked after by the Office {{national}} des forêts, and are a popular tourist attraction of natural interest.|$|R
50|$|The town is a {{major source}} of pine nuts due to stone pine (Pinus pinea) woods {{covering}} the area. The beautiful <b>umbrella</b> <b>pines</b> that surround the village are a source of valuable pine nuts, while olives, grapes, figs, apricots and other fruits are cultivated here as well.|$|R
50|$|Henry Pochin’s {{legacy to}} Bodnant was {{planting}} the garden’s great conifers; the cedars on the Lily Terrace (from Africa and Middle East) and the Pinetum in the Dell which includes American and Asian conifers including Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas Fir) Pinus radiata, Sciadopitys verticella (Japanese <b>Umbrella</b> <b>Pine),</b> Chamaecyparis pisifera (Japanese false cypress), Sequoiadendron giganteum (Giant Redwood).|$|E
50|$|In 1950, an Italian botanist, Domenico Casella, {{suggested}} that a depiction of a pineapple was represented among wall paintings of Mediterranean fruits at Pompeii. According to Wilhelmina Feemster Jashemski, this interpretation has been challenged by other botanists, who identify it as a pine cone from the <b>Umbrella</b> <b>pine</b> tree, which is native to the Mediterranean area.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 {{the trees}} of the University Park campus were named an {{arboretum}} to honor Chancellor Emeritus Chester M Alter. The Arboretum comprises over 2,000 trees, including many rare specimens for Colorado. Specimens include: Giant Sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), Dawn Redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides),Cedar of Lebanon (Cedrus libani), Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum), <b>Umbrella</b> <b>Pine</b> (Sciadopytis) and many species of Maples (Acer)and Oaks (Quercus).|$|E
50|$|Until the 19th {{century the}} Natural Reserve Bosco di Alcamo {{was covered with}} a {{broad-leaved}} wood which disappeared because of man's action. Since 1921 it has undergone a reforestation work with Aleppo'pine, cypress and <b>umbrella</b> <b>pines.</b> Later there was the gradual reappearance of species of local broad-leaved plants.|$|R
50|$|Today {{the garden}} {{contains}} {{a collection of}} unusual subtropical plants centered on a double pool, and rising in terraces. As at Hidcote, Johnson used hedges and low walls to divide the garden into discrete areas. Notable plant specimens include a superb Mahonia siamensis and Arbutus unedo, <b>umbrella</b> <b>pines,</b> Buddleja officinalis, Rosa chinensis, and bamboo, as well as good collections of cycads and succulents from around the world.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Luigi Filiani {{developed}} {{the area as}} a beach resort, enhanced by the planting of pine trees. Despite opposition from the then mayor of Mutignano, in May 1923 he received a concession from the Maritime Agency to plant a pine wood that would revert to the State after 25 years. Filiani levelled the ground and planted 2000 <b>umbrella</b> <b>pines</b> (Pinus pinea) along the beach. He went on to plant pine trees, holm oaks and laurel on the surrounding hills.|$|R
50|$|The {{mountains}} {{immediately to}} the north of Caunes hold a wider variety of “maquis” flora, often in addition to the garrigue species: large semi-natural woodland areas comprising holm and pubescent oak, <b>umbrella</b> <b>pine,</b> juniper (Common Juniper, ‘Juniperus phoenicea’ and ‘Juniperus oxycedrus' - locally called ‘cade’ are each abundant), olive and almond.The limestone encourages numerous other small plants such as various orchids, fritillaries and iris.|$|E
5000|$|In 1937, the Savage Garden {{was damaged}} by a tornado, and {{remained}} {{in a state}} of disrepair for several years. [...] In 1986, the Savage family sold the garden to Bill Dohm and Patty Cooper. Dohm and Cooper have since renovated the garden and restored its fountain. [...] Plant species found in the garden include Japanese <b>Umbrella</b> <b>Pine,</b> Chinese Pistache, Jack-in-the-Pulpit, and Dwarf Crested Iris.|$|E
5000|$|The {{national}} park inhabits many typical flora {{species of the}} Mediterranean climate. Turkish pine (Pinus brutia) and oak (Quercus [...] ) form woodlands, and (Quercus [...] ) shrub groves in the {{national park}}. Other plants are turpentine tree (Pistacia terebinthus) and sumac (Rhus). Picnic areas of the national park were planted with <b>umbrella</b> <b>pine</b> (Sciadopitys), walnut tree (Juglans), plane tree (Platanus), mulberry tree (Morus), melissa and hortensia (Hydrangea).|$|E
60|$|The very {{afternoon}} after Aaron's arrival in Florence the sky became dark, the wind cold, and rain began steadily to fall. He {{sat in his}} big, bleak room above the river, and watched the pale green water fused with yellow, the many-threaded streams fuse into one, as swiftly the surface flood {{came down from the}} hills. Across, the dark green hills looked darker in the wet, the <b>umbrella</b> <b>pines</b> held up in vain above the villas. But away below, on the Lungarno, traffic rattled as ever.|$|R
2500|$|Seven {{weeks after}} the funeral Shelley memorialised Keats in his poem Adonaïs. Clark saw to the {{planting}} of daisies on the grave, saying that Keats would have wished it. For public health reasons, the Italian health authorities burned the furniture in Keats's room, scraped the walls, made new windows, doors and flooring. The ashes of Shelley, one of Keats's most fervent champions, are buried in the cemetery and Joseph Severn is buried next to Keats. Describing the site today, Marsh wrote, [...] "In the old part of the graveyard, barely a field when Keats was buried here, there are now <b>umbrella</b> <b>pines,</b> myrtle shrubs, roses, and carpets of wild violets".|$|R

50|$|It {{was thought}} since the 1850s that the resin that became amber was {{produced}} by the tree Pinites succinifer, but research in the 1980s {{came to the conclusion}} that the resin originates from several species. More recently, it has been proposed, on the evidence of Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of amber and resin from living trees, that conifers of the family Sciadopityaceae were responsible. The only extant representative of this family is the Japanese <b>umbrella</b> <b>pine,</b> Sciadopitys verticillata.|$|E
50|$|The stone pine, {{botanical name}} Pinus pinea, {{also known as}} the Italian stone pine, <b>umbrella</b> <b>pine</b> and parasol pine, is a tree from the pine family (Pinaceae). The tree is native to the Mediterranean region, {{occurring}} in Southern Europe, Israel, Lebanon and Syria. It is also naturalized in North Africa, the Canary Islands, South Africa and New South Wales. The species was introduced into North Africa millennia ago, such a long time that it is essentially indistinguishable from being native.|$|E
50|$|The formal garden {{contains}} a wide central path lined with hedges and topiaries. Grassy side paths wander through colorful and exotic flowers. The garden’s colors change {{every few weeks}} in the warmer months as new species come into bloom. Spring-time bulbs are abundant with many varieties of tulips and daffodils. Summer-time flowers include an extensive selection of roses. Many similar species are planted together, allowing the visitor to observe the subtle differences. Most plantings are well identified with signs and pictures. Remarkable specimen trees are featured including holly, ginkgo, European beech, Japanese <b>Umbrella</b> <b>Pine,</b> Dawn Redwood, and others.|$|E
50|$|On 5 February the French {{assaulted}} {{the main}} complex of forts defending the Chinese entrenched camp at Dong Song, around Ha Hoa. The two French brigades attacked side by side. The 1st Brigade, on the left, overran {{a number of}} Chinese forts before their defenders could escape, and wiped out the garrisons by blowing in the roofs with dynamite. The 2nd Brigade, on the right, captured the principal Chinese work of Pins Parasols, so named {{because it had been}} built around a conspicuous clump of <b>umbrella</b> <b>pines.</b> The speed of the French attacks, prepared by artillery, kept the Chinese off balance throughout the battle, and French casualties were relatively low: 4 dead and 18 wounded.|$|R
5000|$|The colossal Tuscan colonnades, four columns deep, {{frame the}} {{trapezoidal}} {{entrance to the}} basilica and the massive elliptical area which precedes it. The ovato tondo's long axis, parallel to the basilica's façade, creates a pause in the sequence of forward movements that is characteristic of a Baroque monumental approach. The colonnades define the piazza. The elliptical center of the piazza, which contrasts with the trapezoidal entrance, encloses the visitor with [...] "the maternal arms of Mother Church" [...] in Bernini's expression. On the south side, the colonnades define and formalize the space, with the Barberini Gardens still rising to a skyline of <b>umbrella</b> <b>pines.</b> On the north side, the colonnade masks an assortment of Vatican structures; the upper stories of the Vatican Palace rise above.|$|R

50|$|Taizō-in is {{well known}} for its two gardens. The main garden, Motonobu-no-niwa, is a {{traditional}} Japanese dry landscape garden (karesansui), containing several angular rocks suggesting the cliffs of the island of Hōrai, with smaller stones suggesting a stream. The planting is mostly evergreen, including camellia, pine, and Japanese <b>umbrella</b> <b>pine.</b> It covers 50 tsubo (170 m²) and was designed to integrate a borrowing of scenery ("shakkei") of a view of Narabigaoka Hill in the distance. It is thought to be the final work of Muromachi painter Kanō Motonobu (狩野 元信), reproducing one of his paintings in three dimensions.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the North American continent, whose {{mountain}} ranges are oriented in a north-south direction, the east-west running ranges in Europe blocked the retreat of forest {{species in the}} face of advancing ice sheets. This barrier led to the extinction of several species in Europe. In the early ice ages, horse chestnut (Aesculum hippocastanum) and sweet gum (Liquidambar) became extinct. The following cold period led to the extinction of sequoia (Sequoia), <b>umbrella</b> <b>pine</b> (Sciadopitys, [...] Cryptomeria [...] ), arborvitaes (Thuja), tulip trees (Liriodendron) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga). Hemlock (Tsuga) and hickory (Carya) became extinct during the Quaternary glaciations in Central Europe.|$|E
40|$|Forests in Mediterranean Europe {{are located}} in a hot spot for tropospheric ozone formation. We applied two canopy-level stomatal {{conductance}} models (Jarvis-type and Ball-Woodrow-Berry models) to two Mediterranean evergreen forests (<b>Umbrella</b> <b>pine</b> at San Rossore, and Holm oak at Castelporziano, in central Italy), which is essential for assessing ozone impact on forests via the stomatal flux-based approach. Parameterizations of the models {{was carried out by}} the Eddy Covariance technique. Both Jarvis-type and Ball-Woodrow-Berry models well explained the observed stomatal conductance and stomatal ozone flux in both forests. Maximum stomatal conductance was 72 % higher in <b>Umbrella</b> <b>pine</b> than in Holm oak, leading to higher stomatal ozone flux. Inclusion of a soil water function improved the performance of the Jarvis-type model for the estimation of stomatal ozone flux. We found contrasting results concerning the coefficient m (the slope of the photosynthesis-stomatal conductance relationship) in the Ball-Woodrow-Berry model between the two forests: while m was constant for varying soil water status in the Holm oak forest, it declined with soil drying in the <b>Umbrella</b> <b>pine</b> forest. This may result from higher stomatal sensitivity to drought in <b>Umbrella</b> <b>pine</b> as a response to avoid drought stress. Overall, these results advance our understanding of ozone risk assessment in Mediterranean forests. JRC. C. 5 -Air and Climat...|$|E
5|$|Although Sidney was the {{architect}} of the cemetery, it was superintendent John Boetcher that gave Oakwood its charm. Boetcher became superintendent in 1871 and continued in the position until 1898. At the beginning of his tenure, Oakwood was said to be quite crude. During Boetcher's tenure Oakwood's most important icons were built: the Earl Chapel and Crematorium, the Warren Chapel Mortuary, the keeper's house, the office lodge, numerous mausolea, and both the 101st Street and 114th Street entrances (including a bridge over the Troy and Boston Railroad on Oakwood's western border to the 101st Street entrance). Boetcher incorporated exceptional landscape design techniques during his tenure; Oakwood developed shifting landscape scenery: some areas are dominated by flowing lawns while others comprise dense foliage. Boetcher brought in rare and foreign plants to help beautify the cemetery, including <b>umbrella</b> <b>pines</b> and Colorado blue spruce.|$|R
60|$|Having {{passed a}} few more compliments, we saluted and walked on; and, coming {{presently}} {{to the edge of}} the cliff, lay down on the thyme and the crumbled leaf-dust. All the small singing birds had long been shot and eaten; there came to us no sound but that of the waves swimming in on a gentle south wind. The wanton creatures seemed stretching out white arms to the land, flying desperately from a sea of such stupendous serenity; and over their bare shoulders their hair floated back, pale in the sunshine. If the air was void of sound, it was full of scent--that delicious and enlivening perfume of mingled gum, and herbs, and sweet wood being burned somewhere a long way off; and a silky, golden warmth slanted on to us through the olives and <b>umbrella</b> <b>pines.</b> Large wine-red violets were growing near. On such a cliff might Theocritus have lain, spinning his songs; on that divine sea Odysseus should have passed. And we felt that presently the goat-god must put his head forth from behind a rock.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout her life, Madeleine Dior {{lived out}} {{her passion for}} flowers through the {{transformation}} of the windswept land surrounding her villa in Granville into a beautiful English-style garden. First she had a veranda added to the façade of the house, which sheltered a winter garden, and planted a small wood of <b>umbrella</b> <b>pines</b> to protect her plants from the wind. This was a bold choice of tree for the Normandy coast. She also had windbreak walls put up to protect the property, and finally she had a greenhouse built where the plants were overwintered. On the advice of Christian Dior, the greenhouse was replaced in 1925 by a pergola and pool; a rose garden was planted nearby a short while later. The creation of the garden became a two-person job, which created a bond between Madeleine Dior and her son: the latter organized it by positioning the features, while she took care of the planting. The result was a complex planting scheme that sheltered the most fragile flowers from the wind: [...] "Madeleine Dior's planting formed curtains of shielding greenery, so that the second was more precious and the third consisted of plants {{that it would have been}} impossible to grow here: geraniums, roses, jasmine... All these protective screens created layers, structures and motif effects," [...] explains the garden's current landscape gardener.|$|R
40|$|<b>Umbrella</b> <b>pine</b> cone {{production}} {{is an important}} forest non-wood product in Portugal,especially {{in the region of}} Alcácer do Sal, where it plays an important role to the local development. Traditionally <b>umbrella</b> <b>pine</b> cones are manually harvested, increasing production costs and, above all, with very high accident risk to the workers. The development of equipment for mechanical harvesting started in Italy in the 1980 's. Studies report different values for harvesting efficiency and tree damage, the latter in terms of immature cones and branches detached. In this study a trunk shaker was used to evaluate mechanical harvesting both in terms of efficiency and tree damage induced by trunk vibration. In comparison to the manual process, time required for mechanised harvesting was about 1 / 15 th of the time. The results revealed a mechanical harvesting efficiency higher than 86 % with negligible tree damage. Inter-annual harvest efficiency variability was also observed...|$|E
40|$|Most <b>umbrella</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus pinea L.) stands {{are managed}} as {{agroforestry}} systems, whose main production is fruit, {{due to the}} edible and highly nutritious kernels, and are frequently associated to natural or seeded pastures and grazing. The stands have low density, {{in order to enhance}} crown growth and fruit production. Nevertheless, cone production, both with regard to number and weight, varies greatly between stands, trees and years. In this study were selected three agroforestry systems, representative of <b>umbrella</b> <b>pine</b> stands whose main production is fruit, and one stand representative of the timber production system, where fruit is the secondary production. It was evaluated the variability in cone production {{as a function of the}} tree’s diameter at breast height and crown diameter and the individual tree’s competition status. The results indicate that stands managed in agroforestry systems with lower competition and individuals with larger diameter at breast height and crown diameter tend to produce more and heavier cones per tree. The first two principal components of the principal component analysis explain 84 % of the variance in cone production, trees’ dimensions and competition index. Tree competition status has a negative impact on production per tree...|$|E
40|$|Above {{ground biomass}} is {{frequently}} estimated with forest inventory data and an extrapolation method for the {{per unit area}} evaluations. This procedure is labour demanding and costly. In this study above ground biomass functions, whose independent variable is crown horizontal projection, were developed. Multi-resolution segmentation method and object-oriented classification, based on very high spatial resolution satellite images, were used to obtain the area of tree crown horizontal projection for <b>umbrella</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus pinea L.). A set of inventory plots were measured and with existing allometric functions for this species above ground biomass per tree and per plot were calculated. The two data sets were used to fit linear functions both for individual plot and their cumulative values. The results show a good performance of the models. Errors smaller than 10 % are obtained for stand areas greater than 1. 4 ha. These functions have the advantages of estimating above ground biomass for all the area under study or surveillance, not requiring forest inventory; allow monitoring in short time periods; and are easily implemented in a geographical information system environment...|$|E
50|$|Oakwood was {{designed}} by John C. Sidney, a Philadelphia engineer familiar with cemetery design, {{with the help of}} Garnet Douglass Baltimore, the first African American to earn a degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The plan consisted of roads, man-made lakes, dense vegetation, and rolling hills, covering about 300 acre, including the modern sections A through Q. Sidney also designed the original superintendent's house and receiving tomb, neither of which exist today. For all Sidney's extensive planning, the first plots were laid out in a seemingly haphazard manner by the first superintendent, Robert Fergusson.Although Sidney was the architect of the cemetery, it was superintendent John Boetcher that gave Oakwood its charm. Boetcher became superintendent in 1871 and continued in the position until 1898. At the beginning of his tenure, Oakwood was said to be quite crude.

5000|$|Meanwhile, de Négrier's 2nd Brigade painfully {{crossed the}} Black River at Vu Chu on 10 April. Millot's staff had {{assembled}} fifteen junks and two tugs for this operation, but de Négrier had nearly 4,000 men {{to get across}} and a large artillery train. Five French soldiers and a dozen coolies, [...] too impatient to wait their turn to cross the river by junk, tried to swim across and were carried away by the strong current and drowned. These were the only French casualties of the Hưng Hóa operation. At 6 a.m. on 11 April the 2nd Brigade left the Black River and marched due west towards Hưng Hóa. At 9 a.m. the brigade's advance guard occupied a position on a wooded height overlooking the Red River above the village of Trung Hà, whose plateau, thickly covered in tall <b>umbrella</b> <b>pines,</b> offered an ideal observation post and firing platform for the French artillery. Hưng Hóa on the southern bank of the Red River, was clearly visible five kilometres to the west. By 10:00, Millot's heavy artillery and {{the bulk of the}} 2nd Brigade's infantry were assembled on the Trung Hà plateau. The Black Flags remained inside Hưng Hóa, and made no attempt to dispute the French advance. Millot had hoped that the gunboats of the Tonkin Flotilla could support the attack, but Hache and Yatagan drew too much water to sail beyond the confluence of the Red River and the Clear River. Only Trombe and Éclair reached the junction of the Red and Black Rivers {{to take part in the}} upcoming battle.|$|R
40|$|The Doñana National and Natural Parks (SW Spain) present two {{distinct}} substrates: the marshes, a silted-up former estuary, and the sands, a Pleistocene detritic formation of gravels, {{which has been}} repeatedly covered by dune mantles. The last historical dune-building period occurred during the Little Ice Age (XVI to XIX Centuries) with repeated pulses of dune advance and stability reaching to the El Partido stream watershed to the N of the Parks. The successional response of vegetation developed a cork oak forest with scattered wild olives and elms and dense scrub vegetation. Ashes and willows grew along stream banks. Early in the XX Century scrub was cleared and <b>umbrella</b> <b>pines</b> were planted, {{although some of the}} area was reserved for crops. By 1970, to further expand agriculture, most trees in the area had been removed and the old dune morphology was partially erased by wind blow. In 2004, the Spanish Ministry of Environment bought some 4, 000 ha of El Partido watershed for ecological restoration in the framework of the Doñana 2005 Project, a large hydrology and landscape plan for the restoration of the Doñana Parks. The landscape restoration of the watershed now under way includes forestation and plantation of native scrub to reconstruct plant communities in order to support threatened vertebrate populations. However, the old dunes are subject to a different treatment with the purpose of recovering their primeval vegetation and to make them more noticeable in the landscape. The paper briefly describes the vegetation, hydrol-ogy, and ecological history of the area focusing on the restoration of the ancient dunes and the en-hancement of their visual perception. ...|$|R
