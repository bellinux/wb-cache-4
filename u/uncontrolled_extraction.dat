40|$|Globally, remnant {{fragments}} of forests represent the main carbon reservoir of terrestrial ecosystems, but they suffer strong degradation due to <b>uncontrolled</b> wood <b>extraction</b> mainly by tree cut for household fuel use and charcoal production. The present study evaluates the degradation caused by wood extraction on carbon pools and soil nutrient dynamics in temperate forests distributed in remnant fragments located in central Mexico. Four sites with different intensity of wood extraction {{were chosen for}} measuring carbon pools and nutrient fluxes during two years. Both, aboveground carbon biomass and soil organic carbon values decreased with the intensity of forest degradation. The degraded forest (DF) showed total carbon content 55 % lower than that shown by the seminatural forest (SF). Additionally, litterfall production was reduced in DF as compared to SF; the decomposition rate of standing litter was higher in the latter site. As a consequence, DF had lower organic matter inputs to the soil than that presented by SF. Soil extractable ammonium and microbial biomass-carbon and -nitrogen were lower in DF than in SF. It was concluded that the <b>uncontrolled</b> wood <b>extraction</b> in these remnants of temperate forest in Mexico significantly reduced the carbon pools, carbon and nutrient fluxes through litterfall and consequently, the soil nutrient dynamics were disrupted...|$|R

This paper studies {{the way to}} tackle the forest degradation in WKNP, with less negative impacts to the local people. Study was conducted by analysing existing data and maps of WKNP in terms of forest degradation, forest inventories, current policies, survey on how fuelwood is extracted, observation on fuelwood gatherers, fuelwood demand, and identification of further policy options. Results show that the most significant factors influencing the fuelwood extraction activity in WKNP are land ownership, followed by the distance to forest area, income level, the number of household members and age of household head. In the field, the fuelwood utilization is allowed by WKNP Authority, although it is formally forbidden. It was stated that fuelwood extraction in the area should be less than 2. 89 ton/ha/year to maintain its sustainability, based on the mean WNKP forest tree annual increment. The fact shows that fuelwood extraction in WKNP reduces of forest biomass stock (1. 06 tons/ha/year) and decreases species diversity index (from 3. 05 to 2. 45), species evenness index (from 1. 06 to 0. 91) and old-young tree ratio (from 1. 29 to 1). Ecosystem quality reduction is mainly caused by destructive techniques in extracting fuelwood such as slashing, scratching cambium, and cutting trees. Therefore, recommended policy includes legalizing fuelwood extraction with restrictions, providing alternative fuelwood and other biomass energy resources outside WKNP, conducting preventive (establishing checkpoints and increasing patrols) and pre-emptive (educating and campaigning) efforts, collaborating with other stakeholders, and empowering local economy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Uncontrolled</b> {{groundwater}} <b>extraction</b> {{has been}} proposed as {{the main cause of}} accelerated subsidence in the delta region north of Manila Bay. However, natural autocompaction of deltaic sediment and other anthropogenic factors also enhance subsidence, amplifying global sea-level rise and aggravating land loss, flooding, and tidal inundation. Here, we report how we determine the longer-term subsidence rates and paleo-sealevel history of the delta plain using sediment cores. Four sediment cores 3 to 10. 7 m long taken in Bocaue and Malolos, Bulacan and Lubao, Pampanga all display shoaling-upward sequences that consist of, from bottom to top: basal shallow-marine clays comprising nearly half of each core; mangrove peat; beach sand; fluvial sand and mud; and uppermost floodplain clays. Porosities of the deltaic sediments range from 0. 3 to 0. 8. Peat has the highest porosities, from 0. 7 to 0. 8. Calculations indicate about 2 to 6 m of compaction for the whole sediment sequence. Wood fragments at 7 m and 8. 4 m depths in the shallow-marine section of the Pampanga core respectively yielded radiocarbon ages of 1800 ± 40 and 1730 ± 40 years. If around 1, 000 years ago is when the surface 10 m of sediments started compacting, they would have done so at rates of 0. 2 to 0. 6 cm/y. Natural compaction in similar environments such as in Po Delta, Italy and Mississippi Delta are comparable, ranging from 0. 09 to 0. 37 cm/y. The small values acquired in this study imply that large human-induced components may account for as much as 97 percent of the subsidence in Pampanga...|$|R
40|$|The high <b>uncontrolled</b> {{groundwater}} <b>extraction</b> in Jifarah Plain, NW Libya, {{causes a}} modification of natural flow systems, inducing seawater intrusion and causing groundwater quality deterioration. The principal {{aim of this study}} is to identify the hydrogeochemical processes in this coastal aquifer in order to verify the main sources of sulfate concentration increase that occurs in the system. In order to achieve this aim, water samples were collected from 134 sampling wells in the study area and analyzed for the major cations and anions; physical and chemical parameters were measured, such as water level, electrical conductivity, pH and temperature. The analytical results obtained in the hydrochemical study were interpreted using Piper diagram, ion correlations with Na+/Cl-, SO 42 -, Cl- and TDS, in conjunction with calculation of the ionic deviations of the conservative freshwater/seawater mixture and saturation indices using the PHREEQC 2. 16 software. The large SO 42 anomaly observed in groundwater near the coast was explained by the presence of seawater intrusion and upconing of deep saline water in these areas. This conclusion is based on high chloride concentrations, the inverse cation exchange reactions and the lower piezometric level compared to sea level. Inland, in Sabratah, the high SO 42 -values are related to gypsum dissolution from the Upper Miocene Formation in the lower part of the upper aquifer. These locally high SO 42 concentrations in the south of the study area show overall increase in the upstream direction, which also suggests the dissolution of evaporites from the mountain aquifers in the south. High SO 42 -concentration is also related to the effect of the scattered sebkha deposits in some areas along the coast...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFlexibility {{in power}} plants with amine based carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture is widely {{recognised}} {{as a way}} of improving power plant revenues. Despite the prior art, its value as a way to improve power plant revenues is still unclear. Most studies are based on simplifying assumptions about the capabilities of power plants to operate at part load and to regenerate additional solvent after interim storage of solvent. This work addresses this gap by examining the operational flexibility of supercritical coal power plants with amine based CO 2 capture, using a rigorous fully integrated model. The part-load performance with capture and with additional solvent regeneration, of two coal-fired supercritical power plant configurations designed for base load operation with capture, and with the ability to fully bypass capture, is reported. With advanced integration options configuration, including boiler sliding pressure control, <b>uncontrolled</b> steam <b>extraction</b> with a floating crossover pressure, constant stripper pressure operation and compressor inlet guide vanes, a significant reduction of the electricity output penalty at part load is observed. For instance at 50 % fuel input and 90 % capture, the electricity output penalty reduces from 458 kWh/tCO 2 (with conventional integration options) to 345 kWh/tCO 2 (with advanced integration options), compared to a reduction from 361 kWh/tCO 2 to 342 kWh/tCO 2 at 100 % fuel input and 90 % capture. However, advanced integration options allow for additional solvent regeneration to a lower magnitude than conventional integration options. The latter can maintain CO 2 flow export within 10 % of maximum flow across 30 – 78 % of MCR (maximum continuous rating). For this configuration, one hour of interim solvent storage at 100 % MCR is evaluated to be optimally regenerated in 4 h at 55 % MCR, and 3 h at 30 % MCR, providing rigorously validated useful guidelines for the increasing number of techno-economic studies on power plant flexibility, and CO 2 flow profiles for further studies on integrated CO 2 networks...|$|R

In the last decades, it was shown that due to purposeful rare-earth (RE) doping, these glasses could be also employed {{for a number of}} very important active device applications [3, 4]. In this case, the mid-IR light can be initiated by emission of excited RE ions (such as Pr 3 +, Er 3 +, Dy 3 +, Tb 3 +) on different wavelengths, thus creating the remote sources of light [5 – 8]. From purely implementation point, it is important to achieve a high enough concentration of RE ions in ChG. One of best solutions relies on introducing Ga (or In) into ChG matrix, permitting dissolution of higher ratio of RE dopants [8 – 13]. However, the Ga additions may essentially restrict glass-forming ability in many ChG systems [8, 11, 13 – 15] provoking parasitic devitrification processes at a nanoscale through phase separation, crystallite nucleation, growth, and <b>extraction</b> (<b>uncontrolled</b> spontaneous crystallization).
