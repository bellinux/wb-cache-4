The target sample, extracted from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, included secondary school students in their last year of school in the United States who were compared to those in Australia and Israel. Propensity scoring was used to control for background variables while estimating the achievement differences between students taking advanced courses {{and those who did}} not take such courses.

School variables such as shortage of instructional materials or percentage of teachers with no university level certification in mathematics or science could not explain this phenomenon. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted, which showed that the achievement gap estimate was susceptible to hidden bias across the three countries.

The authors used a multiple logistic regression analysis with replicate weights to model the current smoking status logit {{as a function of}} a number of covariates. The final model included individual- and family-level sociodemographic characteristics, survey attributes, and multiple two-way interactions of survey mode and respondent type with other covariates. The respondent type is a significant predictor of current smoking prevalence and the magnitude of the difference depends on the age, sex, and education of the person whose smoking status is being reported. Furthermore, the survey mode has significant interactions with survey year, sex, and age. The authors conclude that using an overall <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimate</b> of the current smoking prevalence may result in underestimating the current smoking rate when conducting proxy or telephone interviews especially for some sub-populations, such as young adults. They propose that estimates could be improved if more detailed information regarding the respondent type and survey administration mode characteristics were considered in addition to commonly used survey year and sociodemographic characteristics. This information is critical given that future surveillance is moving toward more complex designs. Thus, adjustment of estimates should be contemplated when comparing current smoking prevalence results within a given survey series with major changes in methodology over time and between different surveys using various modes and respondent types.

Recently, several studies examining adhesion formation after repeat CS appear to favour {{closure of the}} peritoneum after caesarean section. We performed a systematic review of the current available evidence {{with regard to the}} long-term outcome, mainly in terms of adhesion formation after closure versus non-closure of peritoneum during CS. We undertook a literature search between January 1995 and February 2008 using MEDLINE, Pubmed, EMBASE, Cochrane central controlled trials register and Cochrane pregnancy and childbirth group trials register. We also had searched all the references cited in the relevant studies. Both English and non-English language papers were included. Prospective studies which compared peritoneal closure versus non-closure during CS in terms of adhesion formation were included. Studies were included if they had a primary objective to examine adhesion formation in a repeat caesarean section, had a clear study design, had an adhesion scoring system, excluded patients who had adhesions in the primary caesarean section or interim surgeries after the primary caesarean section, and had no usage of anti-adhesion agents in the primary caesarean section. Retrospective studies which were performed by case-notes review alone, were excluded. Eleven studies were identified via our search strategy. Five were retrospective and six were prospective. Out of the eleven studies, three satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included (n = 249); two studies were follow-ups of RCTs and one was not randomised. Out of 249 women included in the analysis, 110 had peritoneal closure during CS whereas the other 139 did not have peritoneal closure. Meta-analysis was performed using the two randomised studies plus (i) the <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimate</b> from the non-randomised study and (ii) the reported adjusted estimate, adjusted for baseline differences in the groups.

40|$|Two {{issues related}} to {{osteoporosis}} are addressed. (1) To estimate the prevalence of osteoporosis in Canada. (2) To estimate the effect of initial bone mass on bone mineral density (BMD) decline rates {{over a period of}} three years. We employ data from the Canadian Multicenter Osteoporosis Study (Cantos), a prospective, fixed cohort study comprised of 9, 423 randomly selected subjects from nine different regions in Canada. For the first objective, Cantos had a relatively low participation rate (42 %), so that selection bias is a concern. The Cantos study design, however, included a brief risk factor questionnaire for those invitees that declined further participation. These risk factors were then used to estimate the missing osteoporosis status for non-participants using Bayesian multiple imputation, thus adjusting for nonresponse bias. Both ignorable and non-ignorable imputation models are considered. Complicating study {{of the relationship between the}} initial BMD and rate of decline is the issue of measurement error, which can cause a spurious negative association between the rate of change in a variable and the initial value of the variable. A novel variation on the Bayesian methods of Richardson and Gilks (1993 b) is used to adjust for measurement error in both the initial and year three BMD values. After adjusting for selection bias, prevalence increased from negligible in the youngest age group to 38. 9 % for women and 15. 4 % for men in the 80 + age group. Selection bias was estimated to be relatively small, except in the oldest age group, where the bias was 2. 4 % for women and 5. 4 % for men. For women the unadjusted relationship between the rate of decline of BMD and initial BMD is negative, - 0. 040 (95 % CI = - 0. 053; - 0. 028). Correcting for measurement error results in estimates closer to zero. For example, using a hierarchical model with measurement error correction yields an estimate of - 0. 030 (95 % CI = - 0. 050; - 0. 009). For men the unadjusted relationship between rate of decline and initial BMD was - 0. 026 (95 % CI = - 0. 043; - 0. 009). Correcting for measurement error using the hierarchical model yields a much lower estimate of - 0. 013 (95 % CI = - 0. 041; 0. 016). It is clear that ignoring measurement error results in a heavily biased estimate of the effect of initial BMD on rate of decline of BMD for both women and men. The measurement error adjusted estimates were of a lesser magnitude than the <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimate,</b> with reductions of approximately 25 % to 50 %. The results from this thesis can be used to make decisions about osteoporosis treatment in Canada. Knowledge of the prevalence rates in Canada is useful to public health planners in allocating resources. Knowledge of the relationship between initial levels of BMD and subsequent decline in BMD allows better public health decision making, for example, in deciding whether to focus on bone health early in life, or whether it is more important to prevent decline later in life...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether state laws aimed at preventing childhood lead poisoning are also effective in preventing recurring lead poisoning among children previously poisoned. MethodsAn evaluation was conducted to determine whether laws in two representative states, Massachusetts and Ohio, have been effective in preventing recurrent lead poisoning among children less than 72 months of age previously poisoned, compared to a representative state (Mississippi) which at the time of the study had yet to develop legislation to prevent childhood lead poisoning. ResultsCompared to no legislation, <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimates</b> showed children less than 72 months old, living in Massachusetts, previously identified as being lead poisoned, were 73 % less likely to develop recurrent lead poisoning. However, this statistically significant association did not remain after controlling for other confounding variables. We did not find such a significant association when analyzing data from Ohio. ConclusionsWhile findings from <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimates</b> indicated that state lead laws such as those in Massachusetts may be effective at preventing recurrent lead poisoning among young children, small numbers may have attenuated the power to obtain statistical significance during multivariate analysis.

40|$|In most {{randomized}} controlled trials (RCTs), investigators typically rely on estimators of causal effects {{that do not}} exploit {{the information in the}} many baseline covariates that are routinely collected in addition to treatment and the outcome. Ignoring these covariates can lead to a significant loss is estimation efficiency and thus power. Statisticians have underscored the gain in efficiency that can be achieved from covariate adjustment in RCTs with a focus on problems involving linear models. Despite recent theoretical advances, there has been a reluctance to adjust for covariates based on two primary reasons; 1) covariate-adjusted estimates based on non-linear regression models {{have been shown to be}} less precise than unadjusted methods, and, 2) concern over the opportunity to manipulate the model selection process for covariate adjustment in order to obtain favorable results. This dissertation describes statistical approaches for covariate adjustment in RCTs using targeted maximum likelihood methodology for estimation of causal effects with binary and right-censored survival outcomes. Chapter 2 provides the targeted maximum likelihood approach to covariate adjustment in RCTs with binary outcomes, focusing on the estimation of the risk difference, relative risk and odds ratio. In such trials, investigators generally rely on the <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimate</b> as the literature indicates that covariate-adjusted estimates based on logistic regression models are less efficient. The crucial step that has been missing when adjusting for covariates is that one must integrate/average the adjusted estimate over those covariates in order to obtain the population-level effect. Chapter 2 shows that covariate adjustmentin RCTs using logistic regression models can be mapped, by averaging over the covariate(s), to obtain a fully robust and efficient estimator of the marginal effect, which equals a targeted maximum likelihood estimator. Simulation studies are provided that demonstrate that this targeted maximum likelihood method increases efficiency and power over the unadjusted method, particularly for smaller sample sizes, even when the regression model is misspecified. Chapter 3 applies the methodology presented in Chapter 3 to a sampled RCT dataset with a binary outcome to further explore the origin of the gains in efficiency and provide a criterion for determining whether a gain in efficiency can be achieved with covariate adjustment over the unadjusted method. This chapter demonstrates through simulation studies and the data analysis that not only is the relation between $R^ 2 $ and efficiency gain important, but also the presence of empirical confounding. Based on the results of these studies, a complete strategy for analyzing these type of data is formalized that provides a robust method for covariate adjustment while protecting investigators from misuse of these methods for obtaining favorable inference. Chapters 4 and 5 focus on estimation of causal effects with right-censored survival outcomes. Time-to-event outcomes are naturally subject to right-censoring due to early patient withdrawals. In chapter 4, the targeted maximum likelihood methodology is applied to the estimation of treatment specific survival at a fixed end-point in time. In chapter 5, the same methodology is applied to provide a competitor to the logrank test. The proposed covariate adjusted estimators, under no or uninformative censoring, do not require any additional parametric modeling assumptions, and under informative censoring, are consistent under consistent estimation of the censoring mechanism or the conditional hazard for survival. These targeted maximum likelihood estimators have two important advantages over the Kaplan-Meier and logrank approaches; 1) they exploit covariates to improve efficiency, and 2) they are consistent in the presence of informative censoring. These properties are demonstrated through simulation studies. Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of the preceding chapters and a discussion of future research directions...|$|E

After the calculation of annual incidence rates for the 20022 ̆ 0132012 period, we analyzed trends using generalized autoregressive moving-average models with 2 -year moving averages. RESULTSA total of 11, 245 youths with type 1 diabetes (0 to 19 years of age) and 2846 with type 2 diabetes (10 to 19 years of age) were identified.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} light {{drinking}} in pregnancy {{is linked to}} unfavourable developmental outcomes in children. DESIGN: Prospective population-based cohort. SETTING: UK. POPULATION: Ten thousand five hundred and thirty-four 7 -year-olds. METHODS: Quasi-experimental using propensity score matching (PSM) to compare children born to light (up to 2 units per week) and non-drinkers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Behavioural difficulties rated by parents and teachers; cognitive test scores for reading, maths and spatial skills. RESULTS: Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and PSM analyses are presented. For behavioural difficulties, <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimates</b> for percentage standard deviation (SD) score differences ranged from 2 to 14 %. On adjustment for potential confounders, differences were attenuated, {{with a loss of}} statistical significance, except for teacher-rated boys' difficulties. For boys, parent-rated behavioural difficulties: unadjusted, - 11. 5; OLS, - 4. 3; PSM, - 6. 8; teacher-rated behavioural difficulties: unadjusted, - 13. 9; OLS, - 9. 6; PSM, - 10. 8. For girls, parent-rated behavioural difficulties: unadjusted, - 9. 6; OLS, - 2. 9; PSM, - 4. 5; teacher-rated behavioural difficulties: unadjusted, - 2. 4; OLS, 4. 9; PSM, 3. 9. For cognitive test scores, <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimates</b> for differences ranged between 12 and 21 % of an SD score for reading, maths and spatial skills. After adjustment for potential confounders, estimates were reduced, but remained statistically significantly different for reading and for spatial skills in boys. For boys, reading: unadjusted, 20. 9; OLS, 8. 3; PSM, 7. 3; maths: unadjusted, 14. 7; OLS, 5. 0; PSM, 6. 5; spatial skills: unadjusted, 16. 2; OLS, 7. 6; PSM, 8. 1. For girls, reading: unadjusted, 11. 6; OLS, - 0. 3; PSM, - 0. 5; maths: unadjusted, 12. 9; OLS, 4. 3; PSM, 3. 9; spatial skills: unadjusted, 16. 2; OLS, 7. 7; PSM, 6. 4. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that light drinking during pregnancy is not linked to developmental problems in mid-childhood. These findings support current UK Department of Health guidelines on drinking during pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive general {{formulae}} for second-order biases of maximum-likelihood estimates {{in a class}} of symmetric nonlinear regression models. This class of models is commonly used for the analysis of data containing extreme or outlying observations in samples from a supposedly normal distribution. The formulae of the biases can be computed by means of an ordinary linear regression. They generalize some previous results by Cook et al., Biometrika 73 (1986) 615 - 623, Cordeiro and Vasconcellos, Statist. Probab. Lett. 35 (1997) 155 - 164 and Cordeiro et al., J. Statist. Comput. Simulation 60 (1998) 363 - 378. We derive simple closed-form expressions for these biases in special models. Simulation results are presented assessing the performance of the bias corrected estimates which indicate that they have smaller biases than the corresponding <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimates.</b> Bias correction Maximum-likelihood estimate Nonlinear regression Symmetric distribution t distribution...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{introduce}} the ‘interaction generality’ measure, a new method for computationally assessing {{the reliability of}} protein–protein interactions obtained in biological experiments. This measure is basically the number of proteins involved in a given interaction and also adopts the idea that interactions observed in a complicated interaction network {{are likely to be}} true positives. Using a group of yeast protein–protein interactions identified in various biological experiments, we show that interactions with low generalities {{are more likely to be}} reproducible in other independent assays. We constructed more reliable networks by eliminating interactions whose generalities were above a particular threshold. The rate of interactions with common cellular roles increased from 63 % in the <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimates</b> to 79 % in the refined networks. As a result, the rate of cross-talk between proteins with different cellular roles decreased, enabling very clear predictions of the functions of some unknown proteins. The results suggest that the interaction generality measure will make interaction data more useful in all organisms and may yield insights into the biological roles of the proteins studied...|$|R
40|$|Freedman [Adv. in Appl. Math. 40 (2008) 180 - 193; Ann. Appl. Stat. 2 (2008) 176 - 196] critiqued {{ordinary}} {{least squares}} regression adjustment of estimated treatment effects in randomized experiments, using Neyman's model for randomization inference. Contrary to conventional wisdom, he argued that adjustment can lead to worsened asymptotic precision, invalid measures of precision, and small-sample bias. This paper shows that in sufficiently large samples, those problems are either minor or easily fixed. OLS adjustment cannot hurt asymptotic precision when {{a full set of}} treatment-covariate interactions is included. Asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be constructed with the Huber-White sandwich standard error estimator. Checks on the asymptotic approximations are illustrated with data from Angrist, Lang, and Oreopoulos's [Am. Econ. J. : Appl. Econ. 1 : 1 (2009) 136 [...] 163] evaluation of strategies to improve college students' achievement. The strongest reasons to support Freedman's preference for <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimates</b> are transparency and the dangers of specification search.

30|$|This {{study is}} {{certainly}} not without limitations. Firstly, the number of studies investigating the associations of certain IL- 10 polymorphisms with renal cancer or bladder cancer is still limited, and sample size of several included studies were obviously not sufficient, which precluded us from drawing definite conclusions. Secondly, our results were based on <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimates</b> since the majority of included studies failed to report baseline characteristics of individuals, such as age, sex, smoking status and eating habits. And lack of analyses adjusted for these potential confounding factors may affect the reliability of our results. Thirdly, although funnel plots revealed no apparent publication bias, we still could not eliminate the possibility of publication bias since only published studies were included. Fourthly, all included studies were published in English or Chinese, therefore, maybe some qualified articles in other languages were missed. Fifthly, genetic associations of IL- 10 polymorphisms with urologic cancer may also be influenced by gene–gene and gene-environmental interactions. It is possible that one certain polymorphism {{may be associated with}} the risk of urologic cancer, but due to interactions with multiple genes and environmental factors, the association would no longer be observed.|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{possible}} {{association between}} psoriasis and celiac disease (CD) {{has long been}} observed, but epidemiologic studies attempting to characterize this association have yielded inconclusive results. This meta-analysis was conducted with the aims to summarize all available data. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that reported relative risk, hazard ratio, odds ratio (OR), or standardized incidence ratio with 95 % confidence interval (CI) comparing the risk of CD in patients with psoriasis versus participants without psoriasis. Pooled risk ratio and 95 % CI were calculated using random-effect, generic inverse-variance methods of DerSimonian and Laird. Results: Four retrospective cohort studies with 12, 912 cases of psoriasis and 24, 739 comparators were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled analysis demonstrated a significantly higher risk of CD among patients with psoriasis compared with participants without psoriasis with the pooled OR of 3. 09 (95 % CI, 1. 92 – 4. 97). Limitations: Most primary studies reported <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimated</b> effect, raising a concern over confounders. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis demonstrated an approximately 3 -fold increased risk of CD among patients with psoriasis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Attributable {{fractions}} (AF) {{assess the}} proportion of cases in a population attributable to certain risk factors but are infrequently reported and mostly calculated without considering potential confounders. While logistic regression for adjusted individual estimates of odds ratios (OR) is widely used, similar approaches for AFs are rarely applied. Methods Different methods for calculating adjusted AFs to risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were applied {{using data from the}} National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We compared AFs from the unadjusted approach using Levin's formula, from Levin's formula using adjusted OR estimates, from logistic regression according to Bruzzi's approach, from logistic regression with sequential removal of risk factors ('sequential AF') and from logistic regression with all possible removal sequences and subsequent averaging ('average AF'). Results AFs following the unadjusted and adjusted (using adjusted ORs) Levin's approach yielded clearly higher estimates with a total sum of more than 100 % compared to adjusted approaches with sums Conclusion Average AFs provide plausible estimates of population attributable risks and should therefore be reported at least to supplement <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimates.</b> We provide functions/macros for commonly used statistical programs to encourage other researchers to calculate and report average AFs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Nonresponse pervades survey {{samples of}} households, and devising methods to handle survey nonresponse {{continues}} to receive substantial attention among statisticians and econometricians. 1 Interest centers {{on whether the}} data are missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR, alternatively known as ignorable nonresponse or selection on observables), or missing nonrandomly (MNR, also known as nonignorable nonresponse or selection on unobservables). The distinction is important because <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimates</b> of model parameters (e. g., unweighted means or least squares coefficients) are consistent when the data are MCAR; however, if the data are MAR or MNR then some adjustment (e. g., bounds, weights, instruments, or assumptions about the missingness process) is needed for consistent estimation. The objective of this technical report is twofold. First, as background material we provide a survey of common methods used to address unit nonresponse, making sharp distinctions between data that are MCAR, MAR, and MNR. The methods described are useful {{in a variety of}} situations where social scientists confront contaminated data. Second, and more specific to the Child Support Demonstration Evaluation (CSDE), we describe briefly the Survey of Wisconsin Works Families (SWWF), a survey of resident parents (RP) and nonresident parents (NRP) associated with the CSDE, and then estimate model...|$|R
40|$|Background: Approximately 34, 000 Mozambicans migrate {{annually}} {{to and from}} South Africa {{to work in the}} mining sector. Mineworkers throughout the world are considered a population at high risk of HIV infection due to sexual risk behaviours associated with migratory work patterns. There is no information on HIV prevalence or associated risk factors for Mozambican mine workers that could guide prevention efforts for this population. We conducted the first Integrated Bio-Behavioral Survey (IBBS) in Mozambican mineworkers to meet this need. Methods: Mineworkers were recruited using simplified Time-Location Sampling (TLS) between February and March 2012, at the border between Mozambique and South Africa. Demographic and behavioural data were collected through a standardized questionnaire and entered into netbooks. The prevalence of HIV was determined by testing dried blood spots with enzyme immunoassays. After assessing possible design effects due to temporal clustering, and finding that variance was similar to that of a simple random sample, <b>unadjusted</b> <b>estimates</b> and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Unweighted logistic regression was used to detect associations with HIV. Results: We recruited 430 mineworkers, of which 323 provided blood samples for HIV testing. Among mineworkers, 24. 7 % had sex partners in both countries in the 12 months prior to the survey and 80. 7...|$|R
