Besides the right to perform a performance and to deny others to perform it, these exclusive rights cover also the live broadcasting of a performance, and the video or audio recording of a previously <b>unfixed</b> <b>performance.</b> As in article 7(1)(c) of the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations, performers' rights also cover the reproduction of non-authorized recordings, and also the reproduction of recordings for purposes other than those agreed upon, including the broadcast of a recording made for non-commercial purposes only. For broadcasts of records made for commercial purposes, the performers, together with the phonogram producer, have only a remuneration right on this secondary use of phonograms.|$|E

5000|$|A related {{concept that}} {{emphasizes}} the political aspect of performance and its exercise of power is performativity. It is associated with philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler. It is an anti-essentialist theory of subjectivity in which a performance of the self is repeated and dependent upon a social audience. In this way, these <b>unfixed</b> and precarious <b>performances</b> come to have the appearance of substance and continuity. A key theoretical point that was most radical in regards to theories of subjectivity and performance {{is that there is}} no performer behind the performance. Butler derived this idea from Nietzsche's concept of [...] "no doer behind the deed." [...] This is to say that there is no self before the performance of the self, but rather that the performance has constitutive powers. This is how categories of the self for Judith Butler, such as gender, are seen as something that one [...] "does," [...] rather than something one [...] "is." ...|$|R
30|$|Nodes {{deployment}} is a {{major challenge}} to a successful implementation of radar sensor network (RSN). The goal of the deployment {{is to ensure that}} the target can achieve expected detection performance with high-energy efficiency. In this article, two deployment strategies, named Hexagonal Deployment Strategy (HDS) and Diamond Deployment Strategy (DDS), are proposed to solve this problem. Each Radar Sensor (RS), separately, obtains probability of target detection depending on the position of RS according to the deployment strategies. To appraise these two deployment strategies, two decision fusion rules are derived over pass-loss fading channel in multi-hop RSN. We combine these two decision fusion rules with <b>unfixed</b> local detection <b>performance.</b> Simulations results show that given a finite number of RSs, our proposed strategies are far superior to Random Deployment Strategy in terms of detection probability and energy consumption to satisfy detection and false alarm requirements. The DDS achieves higher probability of detection and consumption fewer energy than HDS, no matter in decision fusion rules with Binary Transmission (BT) or without Binary Transmission (NBT). The BT fusion rules performs better than NBT and the number of RS needed for expected detection performance is not the more the better.|$|R
40|$|Committee Members: Susie Lan Cassel (Chair), Dawn M Formo, Salah MoukhlisIn "Beauty and the Beast: On Racial Ambiguity" Carla Bradshaw {{describes}} passing as {{an attempt}} to achieve acceptability by claiming membership in some desired group while denying other racial elements in oneself thought tobe undesirable (79). In literature on passing, the mixedrace individual may, as Bradshaw suggests, become a "chameleon" if s/he desires; s/he may choose to pass as one race over another and blend with one race for reasons such as self-preservation. Bradshaw's description of passing as gaining "false access" to a particular group or identity aides in setting the tone for passing as a harmful experience for the mixed-race individual. Specifically, this thesis will show that, as we'll see with Nella Larsen's "Passing," Danzy Senna's Caucasia, and Hanif Kureishi' s The Buddha of Suburbia, not only does passing present the instability of race, but it emotionally and physically destroys the mixed-race individual; the characters have the power and ability to perform and live within different racial worlds, but through their passing they ultimately disempower the nondominant race of which they are a part and empower the dominant race. To support this argument, Chapters One through Three will explore how, imbedded within all three texts, there are four themes in particular that play influential roles in the discussion of mixed-race identity and its relation to passing: + fixed identity vs. <b>unfixed</b> identity + <b>performance</b> of identity + displacement + racial consciousness Keywords: hybrid vigor hybridity mixed-race passing post-colonialism race racial consciousness Danzy Senna's Caucasia Hanif Kureishi' s The Buddha of Suburbia NellaLarsen's "Passing...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{assessed the}} moderating impact of task context {{on the relationship}} between reward and cardiovascular response. Randomly assigned to the cells of a 2 (task context: reward vs. demand) × 2 (reward value: low vs. high) between-persons design, participants performed either a memory task with an unclear performance standard (Experiment 1) or a visual scanning task with an <b>unfixed</b> <b>performance</b> standard (Experiment 2). Before performing the task—where participants could earn either a low or a high reward—participants responded to questions about either task reward or task demand. In accordance with the theoretical predictions derived from Wright's (1996) integrative model, reactivity of pre-ejection period increased with reward value if participants had rated aspects of task reward before performing the task. If they had rated task demand, pre-ejection period did not differ as a function of reward. © 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
