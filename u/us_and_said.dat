500|$|After various {{positions}} in journalism, in 1980 Pratchett became Press Officer for the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) {{in an area}} which covered four nuclear power stations. He later joked that he had demonstrated [...] "impeccable timing" [...] by making this career change so soon after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Pennsylvania, <b>US,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he would [...] "write a book about my experiences, if I thought anyone would believe it".|$|E
500|$|Tom Araya {{said that}} [...] "when we did Divine Intervention, {{this was the}} last conference we ever had with a record label where they sat us down and sold us the idea of how they wanted to do [...] "Divine", and how {{they were going to do}} this with the cover... and all these {{different}} ideas for the album. Then one guy looked at <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'But we need a hit song.' And we said, 'But you've got eleven songs, and if you can't find a hit in one of them then you're shit out of luck because that's what we're giving you.' So we're like saying to them, 'Right, you write the fucking hit song and we'll record it.' That shut the guy up and that was the last time we had any kind of meetings like that!" ...|$|E
500|$|Debbi Peterson {{explained}} {{in an interview}} with MTV UK in 1989 about why Prince gave them the song: [...] " [...] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it." ...|$|E

500|$|Cooder's displeasure {{with the}} Republican Party and its {{financial}} supporters, particularly the Koch Brothers, also inspired his songwriting. He found {{the party to}} be [...] "insanely dangerous" [...] to Barack Obama's presidency and the <b>US,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> of them in an interview for The Guardian, [...] "in case anybody thinks Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin are clowns because they misspeak or don't know their history or they say silly things: that's just an act, and it's a useful act. Everything is a distraction from the core truths which are, first of all, that corporations have taken over the country." [...] He viewed that his songs for the album provide a more convenient alternative for citizens who do not research politicians, saying that [...] "I don't write books and give speeches but with a four-minute song you can use allegory and other means to suggest {{a different point of}} view. It's like looking around the corner, and that's what songs are good at sometimes. They hit you with a new thought – assuming that people will listen." ...|$|E
500|$|Mahler made {{arrangements}} with the impresario Emil Gutmann for the symphony to be premiered in Munich {{in the autumn}} of 1910. He soon regretted this involvement, writing of his fears that Gutmann would turn the performance into [...] "a catastrophic Barnum and Bailey show". Preparations began early in the year, with the selection of choirs from the choral societies of Munich, Leipzig and Vienna. The Munich Zentral-Singschule provided 350 students for the children's choir. Meanwhile, Bruno Walter, Mahler's assistant at the Vienna Hofoper, was responsible for the recruitment and preparation of the eight soloists. Through the spring and summer these forces prepared in their home towns, before assembling in Munich early in September for three full days of final rehearsals under Mahler. His youthful assistant Otto Klemperer remarked later on the many small changes that Mahler made to the score during rehearsal: [...] "He always wanted more clarity, more sound, more dynamic contrast. At one point during rehearsals he turned to <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'If, after my death, something doesn't sound right, then change it. You have not only a right but a duty to do so.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E

2500|$|Having {{considered}} the possibility {{at the end of}} the second season, Cleese left the Flying Circus {{at the end of the}} third. He later explained that he felt he no longer had anything fresh to offer the show, and claimed that only two Cleese- and Chapman-penned sketches in the third series ("Dennis Moore" [...] and the [...] "Cheese Shop") were truly original, and that the others were bits and pieces from previous work cobbled together in slightly different contexts. He was also finding Chapman, who was at that point in the full throes of alcoholism, difficult to work with. According to an interview with Idle, [...] "It was on an Air Canada flight on the way to Toronto, when John (Cleese) turned to all of <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'I want out.' Why? I don't know. He gets bored more easily than the rest of us. He's a difficult man, not easy to be friendly with. He's so funny because he never wanted to be liked. That gives him a certain fascinating, arrogant freedom." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1987, Orbison was {{inducted}} into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and initiated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album [...] "Born to Run": [...] "I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison." [...] In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt [...] "validated" [...] by the honor. A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. They were joined by Jackson Browne, T Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, James Burton, and k.d. lang. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: [...] "Roy looked at all of <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional." [...] The concert was filmed in one take and aired on Cinemax under the title it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.|$|E
2500|$|Dodge {{approached}} Jacques Gershkovitch, a Russian immigrant in Portland guest {{conducting the}} Portland Symphony (which {{would later become}} the Oregon Symphony), about the orchestra after seeing him conduct. Though Gershkovitch first explained {{that he did not}} teach children, Dodge insisted that he come listen to the youth ensemble she had assembled. One orchestra member recalled: [...] "I well remember the excitement of that night when Gershkovitch climbed the stairs to Mary Dodge's attic, where we had assembled to play for him. He listened as we played our hearts out. He applauded <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that if we got the missing instruments, he would take us on." [...] In an attempt to hand over the baton to Gershkovitch, he simply stated [...] "I take." [...] Initially, Dodge remained as associate director of the orchestra; she also assisted with sectionals, appointed a board of directors, and designated the ensemble as the Portland Junior Symphony Orchestra in 1924. The original board of directors established the mission of the orchestra: [...] "to encourage appreciation and rendition of orchestral music by young people, to give public symphonic and popular concerts, to discover and develop latent talent among the children of Portland." [...] Six years later, Dodge resigned while the orchestra was financially sound. She continued to teach and became increasingly dedicated to a scientific approach to bowing. Dodge died in 1954.|$|E

2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to set the}} game four thousand years before [...] {{was one of the}} first details about the game made known. LucasArts gave BioWare a choice of settings for the game. [...] "LucasArts came to <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that we could do an [...] game," [...] BioWare CEO Raymond Muzyka said. [...] "Or LucasArts said we could go 4,000 years back, which is a period that's hardly been covered before." [...] BioWare chose to set the game four thousand years before the films as it gave them greater creative freedom. They aimed to create content similar to that from the films but different enough to be a definite precursor. Concept work had to be sent to [...] "the ranch" [...] to be approved for use. Muzyka noted that very little of their content was rejected: [...] "It was more like, 'Can you just make his head like this rather than like that.' So it was all very feasible. There were good suggestions made and they made the game better, so we were happy to do them. It was a good process really and I think we were pleasantly surprised how easy LucasArts was to work with." [...] Zeschuk said that [...] "Overall, we were really happy with the results. We felt like we had enough freedom to truly create something wonderful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Days after Novak's initial column appeared, Matthew Cooper of Time {{magazine}} published Plame's name, citing unnamed {{government officials}} as sources. In his article, titled [...] "A War on Wilson?", Cooper {{raises the possibility}} that the White House has [...] "declared war" [...] on Wilson for speaking out against the Bush Administration. Cooper initially refused to testify before the grand jury, and was prepared to defy a court order and spend time in jail to protect his sources. At a court hearing, where Cooper was expected to be ordered to jail, Cooper told U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan: [...] "I am prepared to testify. I will comply. Last night I hugged my son good-bye and told him it might {{be a long time before}} I see him again. I went to bed ready to accept the sanctions." [...] Cooper explained that before his court appearance, he had received [...] "in somewhat dramatic fashion" [...] a direct personal communication from his source freeing him from his commitment to keep the source's identity secret. In an interview with National Review, Robert Luskin, Rove's attorney, stated: [...] "Cooper's lawyer called <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Can you confirm that the waiver [...] encompasses Cooper?' I was amazed...So I said, 'Look, I understand that you want reassurances. If Fitzgerald would like Karl to provide you with some other assurances, we will.'" [...] Cooper testified before the grand jury and wrote an account of his testimony for Time. Cooper told the grand jury his sources for his article, [...] "A War on Wilson?", were Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.|$|E
