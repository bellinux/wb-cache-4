25|$|A {{distributed}} denial-of-service (DDoS) is a cyber-attack {{where the}} perpetrator uses {{more than one}} unique IP address, often thousands of them. The incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively {{makes it impossible to}} stop the attack simply by using ingress filtering. It also makes it very difficult to distinguish legitimate <b>user</b> <b>traffic</b> from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin. As an alternative or augmentation of a DDoS, many attacks involve forging of IP sender addresses (IP address spoofing) also so that the location of the attacking machines cannot easily be identified and defeated.|$|E

2500|$|Music blogger Kevin Cogill {{streamed}} nine {{tracks of}} Chinese Democracy on his website Antiquiet for 'an hour or two' in June 2008. The website server crashed {{shortly after the}} leak {{because of the high}} <b>user</b> <b>traffic,</b> and the tracks were removed later. In August, the FBI, under the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act, arrested Cogill for pre-releasing copyrighted material. According to Techdirt, Cogill's arrest unintentionally resulted in a large boost in illegal downloads of the album. They also revealed that UMG showed Best Buy search engine traffic results shortly after the case to capitalize on the interest and help them with the distribution deal. In November he agreed to plead guilty to one federal count of copyright infringement, later brought down to a misdemeanor. Former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash commented on the case, stating [...] "I hope he rots in jail. It's going to affect the sales of the record, and it's not fair." [...] Prosecutors initially aimed for 6 months jail time, but the charges were brought down to a misdemeanor copyright infringement charge. Cogill was sentenced to two months house arrest and was required to produce an anti-piracy video with the RIAA. Cogill claimed he never did the video with the RIAA due to them not wanting to spend money on production costs.|$|E
40|$|Today’s traffic {{accounting}} systems {{are based on}} the assumption that one IP address is associated with one user. But this assumption cannot be applied to multi-user systems, where an IP address can be shared by multiple users at the same time. In this case an IP address can not be uniquely mapped to a single user. In order to provide finer granularity traffic accounting information we suggest a <b>user</b> based <b>traffic</b> accounting concept which can collect and analyze network resource usage metrics on the basis of users. This is an extension to current traffic accounting methods. With this not only IP address attribute but also user attribute are used as aggregating index in collecting the network resource usage information. This paper introduces <b>user</b> based <b>traffic</b> accounting technology and discusses several different mechanisms for <b>user</b> based <b>traffic</b> accounting. The implementation of a <b>user</b> based <b>traffic</b> accounting prototype system with Agent mechanism is introduced. Performance test results indicate that, if carefully designed the <b>user</b> based <b>traffic</b> accounting system affects performance of the system in which it resides only slightly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cooperative {{spectrum}} sensing improves reliability and the detection performance of sensing. However, the fully cooperative scenario {{may not be}} realistic to assume in many cases. We consider a cognitive radio network with heavy <b>traffic</b> <b>users</b> and light <b>traffic</b> <b>users</b> and analyze their behavior towards sensing using the concept of mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Further, we design a distributed game using evolutionary game theory such {{that as long as}} light <b>traffic</b> <b>users</b> are present, they share the sensing responsibility while heavy <b>traffic</b> <b>users</b> get a free ride. Finally, the evolution dynamics is shown to converge to the evolutionarily stable strategy for the case of multiple users. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{research}} {{topic that}} {{is becoming increasingly}} popular is that of on-board mobile communication, where users on a vehicle are connected to a local network that attaches to the Internet via a mobile router and a wireless link. However, wireless data transmission is less efficient, prone to error and unreliable in a mobile environment. There {{is a need to}} make use of multiple access links simultaneously (so-called multihoming), to improve the aggregate bandwidth and the overall service availability on a mobile network. In this paper, we introduce a novel on-board Multihoming Agent for supporting the future on-board multihomed mobile routers. The Multihoming Agent can intelligently stripe <b>user</b> <b>traffics</b> into multiple active WAN interfaces based on the policy in use and the real-time network status and automatically shift <b>user</b> <b>traffics</b> from unavailable links to available ones. We show that by properly deploying the policies defined in the Policy Database and continuously collecting network status, a user can run intelligent load distribution algorithms on top of the mobile router to improve network performance and reliability via our Multihoming Agent.

40|$|Anonymity {{systems like}} Tor {{are known to}} be {{vulnerable}} to malicious relay nodes. Another serious threat comes from the Autonomous Systems (ASes) that carry Tor traffic due to their powerful eavesdropping capabilities. Indeed, an AS (or set of colluding ASes) that lies between the client and the first relay, and between the last relay and the destination, can perform timing analysis to compromise user anonymity. In this paper, we show that AS-level adversaries are much more powerful than previously thought. First, routine BGP rout-ing changes can significantly increase the number of ASes that can analyze a <b>user’s</b> <b>traffic</b> successfully. Second, ASes can actively manipulate BGP announcements to put them-selves on the paths to and from relay nodes. Third, an AS can perform timing analysis even when it sees only one di-rection of the traffic at both communication ends. Actually, asymmetric routing increases the fraction of ASes able to analyze a <b>user’s</b> <b>traffic.</b> We present a preliminary evaluation of our attacks using measurements of BGP and Tor. Our findings motivate the design of approaches for anonymous communication that are resilient to AS-level adversaries...|$|R

Understanding whether a user is using a device from inside the network requires separating <b>user</b> generated <b>traffic</b> from the one that is automatically generated by a machine in the background. To accomplish this, we apply three filtering methods, looking at request URLs and at the inter events distance and periodicity.
