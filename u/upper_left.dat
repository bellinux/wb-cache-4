5|$|In humans, other mammals, and birds, {{the heart}} is divided into four chambers: <b>upper</b> <b>left</b> and right atria; and lower left and right {{ventricle}}s. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains {{a small amount of}} fluid. The wall of {{the heart is}} made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, Pingali Venkayya {{submitted}} thirty new designs, in {{the form}} of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the <b>upper</b> <b>left</b> corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the {{receiving}} chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, {{present in the}} atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also {{on the surface of}} the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the <b>upper</b> <b>left</b> atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible {{on the surface of the}} heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is composed in monochrome, muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are {{the whites of}} his collar and sleeves, the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair. In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome. Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer {{in a manner that}} is both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak, his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty. Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, Ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face. Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a goldâbrown background lit from the right.

40|$|<b>Left</b> <b>upper</b> {{division}} segmentectomy {{is one of}} {{the major}} pulmonary procedures; however, it is sometimes difficult to completely dissect interlobar lymph nodes. We attempted to clarify the prognostic importance of hilar and mediastinal nodes, especially of interlobar lymph nodes, in patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) located in the <b>left</b> <b>upper</b> division. We retrospectively studied patients with primary <b>left</b> <b>upper</b> lobe NSCLC undergoing surgical pulmonary resection (at least lobectomy) with radical lymphadenectomy. The representative evaluation of therapeutic value from the lymph node dissection was determined using Sasako's method. This analysis was calculated by multiplying the frequency of metastasis to the station and the 5 -year survival rate of the patients with metastasis to the station. We enrolled 417 patients (237 men, 180 women). Tumors were located in the lingular lobe and at the <b>upper</b> division of <b>left</b> <b>upper</b> lobe in 69 and 348 patients, respectively. The pathological nodal statuses were pN 0 in 263 patients, pN 1 in 70 patients, and pN 2 in 84 patients. Lymph nodes # 11 and # 7 were significantly correlated with differences in node involvement in patients with <b>left</b> <b>upper</b> lobe NSCLC. Among those with <b>left</b> <b>upper</b> division NSCLC, the 5 -year overall survival in pN 1 was 31. 5 % for # 10, 39. 3 % for # 11, and 50. 4 % for # 12 U. The involvement of node # 11 was 1. 89 -fold higher in the anterior segment than that in the apicoposterior segment. The therapeutic index of estimated benefit from lymph node dissection for # 11 was 3. 38, # 4 L was 1. 93, and the aortopulmonary window was 4. 86 in primary <b>left</b> <b>upper</b> division NSCLC. Interlobar node involvement is not rare in <b>left</b> <b>upper</b> division NSCLC, occurring in > 20 % cases. Furthermore, dissection of interlobar nodes was found to be beneficial in patients with <b>left</b> <b>upper</b> division NSCLC...|$|R

5|$|The {{same year}} GaudÃ­ {{apparently}} {{took part in}} the construction of the , in collaboration with his disciple Francesc Berenguer, though the project's authorship is not clear or to what extent they each contributed to it. The style of the building evokes GaudÃ­'s early work, such as the Casa Vicens or the GÃ¼ell Pavilions; it had an entrance gate in the shape of a fishing net, currently installed in the Park GÃ¼ell. The building was demolished in 1939. Also in 1906 he designed a new banner, this time for the Guild of metalworkers and blacksmiths for the Corpus Christi procession of 1910, in Barcelona Cathedral. It was dark green in colour, with Barcelona's coat of arms in the <b>upper</b> <b>left</b> corner, and an image of Saint Eligius, patron of the guild, with typical tools of the trade. The banner was burned in July 1936.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{decided to}} have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make a}} full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his <b>upper</b> <b>left</b> jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E
5|$|Debates {{about the}} {{national}} flag occurred again in 1917 during the Vilnius Conference. Two colors, green and red, were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art. Artist Antanas Å½muidzinaviÄius decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates {{did not like the}} design as it was too dark and gloomy. Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in between the red (clouds lit up by the morning sun) and green (fields and forests). However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of BasanaviÄius, Å½muidzinaviÄius, and Daugirdas. On April 19, 1918, they submitted their final protocol to the Council of Lithuania. The flag {{was supposed to be a}} tri-color (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom) with Vytis in the <b>upper</b> <b>left</b> corner or in the middle. The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 Constitution of Lithuania did not include any mention of the coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any of the debates failed to produce a historical flag. Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered gold an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, green and red did not follow the existing rules of heraldry. However, no changes were made during the inter-war period.|$|E
30|$|The {{patient was}} an {{asymptomatic}} 66 -year-old {{woman who had}} a 39 -pack-year smoking habit. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed the tumor invading the <b>left</b> <b>upper</b> bronchus and pulmonary artery branches in the <b>left</b> <b>upper</b> lung lobe. Enhanced CT and three-dimensional (3 D) images of the pulmonary artery revealed that pulmonary artery branches (A 4 [*]+[*] 5, A 8, and A 9 [*]+[*] 10) were extending into the lingular and basal segment in ventral side of the <b>left</b> <b>upper</b> bronchus. We completed the resection {{by means of a}} composite resection of the <b>left</b> <b>upper</b> lobe and the superior segment of the lower lobe, avoiding pulmonary angioplasty to preserve the left lower lobe or pneumonectomy.|$|R
