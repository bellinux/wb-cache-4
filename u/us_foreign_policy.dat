5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, American law {{enforcement}} officials had reports of Noriega's possible involvement with narcotics trafficking. No formal criminal investigations were begun, however, with news reports attributing the lack of action to factors including U.S. interest in concluding the Panama Canal treaty, the value of intelligence from Panama, and Panama's support for <b>U.S.</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Kennan {{left the}} Department of State—except for two brief ambassadorial stints in Moscow and Yugoslavia—and became a realist critic of <b>U.S.</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> He {{continued}} to analyze international affairs as {{a faculty member}} of the Institute for Advanced Study from 1956 until his death at age 101.|$|E

5|$|The party's {{views on}} the United States and the Middle East have evolved over time. Despite the anti-American views of some right-wing forums in the 1970s and 1980s (that chiefly were rooted in worries over US {{cultural}} expansion and hegemonic role in world politics {{at the expense of}} Europe), the FPÖ were more positively inclined towards the United States under Haider's leadership in the late 1980s and 1990s. However, this changed in 2003 following Haider visiting Saddam Hussein {{on the eve of the}} Iraq War; he subsequently condemned <b>US</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> and derided George W. Bush for not being very different from Hussein. This move was strongly criticised by the FPÖ, which was part of the then-current government. Nevertheless, in the mid- to late 2000s the FPÖ too criticised <b>US</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> as promoted by Bush, which it saw as leading to increased levels of violence in the Middle East. The party also became more critical of Israel's part in the Israel-Palestine conflict.|$|E
5|$|Fisher {{was part}} of this same working group which {{recommended}} that an internal NSC study be conducted on the overall <b>U.S.</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> as it pertained to the newly developing Cold War. This classified study (declassified in 1977) called NSC-68, was the blueprint for the Truman Doctrine for containment of communism, which provided the overall policy concepts for the U.S. participation in the Cold War throughout the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Roosevelt did {{not wish}} to lead the U.S. into the war; his 1937 Quarantine Speech denouncing {{aggression}} by Italy and Japan had met mixed responses. Welles felt freer in this regard, looking towards postwar border issues and the establishment of a U.S.-led international body that could intervene in such disputes. Roosevelt saw Welles's stronger public statements as experiments that would test the public mood in regard to <b>U.S.</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E
5|$|For its {{coverage}} of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, some (such as Ed Koch) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As`ad AbuKhalil) have insisted that it is pro-Israel. The Israel Lobby and <b>U.S.</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Policy,</b> by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges that The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel. On the other hand, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti-Semitic.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Cheney {{published}} another book, , again co-authored {{with his}} daughter Liz. The book traces the history of <b>U.S.</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> and military successes and failures from Franklin Roosevelt's administration through the Obama administration. The authors {{tell the story of}} what they describe as the unique role the United States has played as a defender of freedom throughout the world since World War II. Drawing upon the notion of American exceptionalism, the co-authors criticize Barack Obama's and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's foreign policies, and offer {{what they see as the}} solutions needed to restore American greatness and power on the world stage in defense of freedom.|$|E

5|$|Noam Chomsky (1928) {{was born}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Jewish {{immigrants}} from Eastern Europe. Becoming academically involved {{in the field of}} linguistics, Chomsky eventually secured a job as Professor of Department of Linguistics & Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the field of linguistics, he is credited as the creator or co-creator of the Chomsky hierarchy, the universal grammar theory, and the Chomsky–Schützenberger theorem. Politically, Chomsky had held radical leftist views since childhood, identifying himself with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism. He was particularly known for his critiques of <b>U.S.</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> and contemporary capitalism, and he {{has been described as a}} prominent cultural figure.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the United States in 1970, Schwarzkopf {{was awarded}} a third Silver Star and a second Purple Heart for risking his life to protect the soldiers, as well as three Bronze Star Medals and a Legion of Merit for his command performance. Still, his {{experiences}} in Vietnam embittered him to <b>U.S.</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> Upon returning to the United States, he spoke of a wariness of future conflicts to author C. D. B. Bryan in 1971: He related these experiences under the assumed name of Lieutenant Colonel Byron Schindler.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of 1796 {{was the first}} contested American presidential election. Twice, George Washington had been elected to office unanimously; however, during his presidency, deep philosophical {{differences between the two}} leading figures in the administration – Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson – regarding domestic economic policy and <b>U.S.</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> caused a rift between them, and led to the founding of the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party. Thus, when Washington announced {{that he would not be}} a candidate for a third term, an intense partisan struggle for control of Congress and the presidency began.|$|E
50|$|Staats left {{government}} service {{for a year}} after the Eisenhower presidential transition, and during most of 1953 he served as research director for Marshall Field & Company.

5|$|The film reignited {{the debate}} over the nature of the Terran society in Heinlein's world, and several critics accused Verhoeven of {{creating}} a fascist universe. Others, and Verhoeven himself, have stated that the film was intended to be ironic, and to critique fascism. The film has also been described as criticizing the jingoism of <b>U.S.</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> the military industrial complex, and the society in the film, which elevates violence over sensitivity. It received several negative critical reviews, reviewers suggesting that it was unsophisticated and targeted a juvenile audience, although some scholars and critics have also supported its description as satirical. The absence of the powered armor technology drew criticism from fans. The success of the film's endeavor to critique the ideology of the novel has been disputed.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's negotiators {{hoped to}} reach a truce in Vietnam prior to the election. Nixon {{received}} astute analysis on the talks from Henry Kissinger, then a consultant to U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman, and his campaign was in regular contact with Anna Chennault (at a July 1968 meeting in Nixon's New York apartment with South Vietnamese ambassador Bùi Diễm, he had been informed that Chennault would represent Nixon during the campaign). She advised South Vietnamese president Thieu {{not to go to}} Paris to join the talks, hinting that Nixon would give him a better deal if elected. Johnson was aware of what was going on, as he had both Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington bugged, and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by Nixon to undermine <b>U.S.</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> On October 31, with no agreement, Johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing, and that peace negotiations would start in Paris on November 6, the day after Election Day. On November 2, after speaking with Chennault again, Thieu stated he would not go to Paris. Johnson telephoned Nixon, who denied any involvement; the President did not believe him. Johnson felt he could not publicly mention Chennault's involvement, which had been obtained by wiretapping, but told Humphrey, who chose not to use the information.|$|E
