The people that are on the ground first, it don't matter much who they are, have to manage pretty badly not to leave their {{descendants}} in social ascendency over all newer comers for ever. Why, I can see it in my own case. I can see that I was a sort of fetich to the bedevilled fancy of the people here when I was seen drunk in the streets every day, just because I was one of the old Hatboro' Putneys; and when I began to hold up, there wasn't a man in the community that wasn't proud and flattered to help me. Curious, isn't it? It made me sick of myself and ashamed of them, and I just made up my mind, as soon as I got straight again, I'd give all my help to the men that hadn't a tradition. That's what I've done, Annie. There isn't any low, friendless rapscallion in this town that hasn't got me for his friend--and Ellen. We've been in all the strikes with the men, and all their fool boycottings and kicking over the traces generally. Anybody else would have been turned out of respectable society for one-half that I've done, but it tolerates me because I'm one of the old Hatboro' Putneys. You're one of the old Hatboro' Kilburns, and if you want to have a mind of your own and a heart of your own, all you've got to do is to have it. They'll like it; they'll think it's original. That's the reason South Hatboro' got after you with that Social <b>Union</b> <b>scheme.</b> They were right in thinking you would have a great deal of influence. I was sorry you had to throw it against Brother Peck." ...|$|E

5000|$|The first railway to be {{constructed}} was the Stafford to Shrewsbury Line, {{as it could}} be built quickly, and would be a great asset to the area. It was also stated that [...] "its construction will not involve the loss of any revenue from the canals." [...] Realignments of various railway companies resulted {{in the formation of the}} London and North Western Railway Company (LNWR) on 1 January 1846, and they saw the Shropshire <b>Union</b> <b>scheme</b> as a threat. They therefore offered to lease the Shropshire Union in late 1846, and an Act to authorise this was obtained in June 1847. Conditions of the lease, which was not fully completed until 25 March 1857, meant that the Shropshire Union dropped all plans for further railway expansion, but they were given a free hand to run the canals as they saw fit. However, Robert Skey, the canal manager, when he addressed a meeting in September 1861, noted that the carriage of general merchandise had suffered, as it had gradually transferred to the railways.|$|E

He went on to say in the article, [...] "I would think that if I was a gay activist, people would say 'Oh, just another bloody fairy out there trying to push his own agenda', but because of my background, people are a little bit puzzled by it and sitting up and listening[...] [...] and in fact I'm getting {{a lot of people that}} are not gay coming up to me and saying to me 'Hey, you know, we've got gay friends and family too'.

5000|$|In her ruling, Judge Jacobson wrote: [...] "Since Windsor, {{the clear}} trend {{has been for}} Federal {{agencies}} to limit the extension of benefits to only those same-sex couples in legally recognized marriages." [...] She pointed out {{that many of these}} agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Department of Labor, that are extending benefits to same-sex couples in a marriage, do not recognize New Jersey civil unions for benefits purposes. She pointed out that the proper issue before the court is whether the New Jersey civil <b>union</b> <b>scheme</b> is unconstitutional because [...] "of the manner it is applied and incorporated by the Federal government." [...] She reasoned that this disparate treatment of civil unions versus marriage raised an equal protection claim under both state and Federal constitutions if a state action led to this situation. Because New Jersey enacted a civil union statute that created a [...] "parallel" [...] structure to marriage and the N.J. Supreme Court deferred to the legislature on the actual name of the legal status granted to same-sex couples [...] "as long as the classifications do not discriminate arbitrarily among persons similarly situated," [...] Windsor changed the significance of the state's civil unions scheme. She determined that [...] "the parallel legal structures created by the New Jersey Legislature no longer provided same sex couples with equal access to the rights and benefits enjoyed by married heterosexual couples, violating the mandate of Lewis and the New Jersey Constitution's equal protection guarantee." ...|$|E

40|$|First {{available}} online: 2 November 2015 This article {{starts out}} from the general question of how fields of regulation have impacted on the private law relationships between individuals, i. e., in competition law and capital market law. It states that the impact is sometimes more direct, as in capital market law, sometimes less direct and felt only after much more time, like in competition law, {{but that it is}} always present. Hence, the first result is obvious: the new Banking <b>Union</b> <b>scheme</b> will impact also on private law relationships. While this is already discussed in some specific areas—namely organisation of banks and recovery and resolution of banks (with the bail-in mechanism) —and while these areas are addressed in this article as well, the question most thoroughly dealt with here is whether such impact will be felt more generally and how it should be shaped. It concerns all bank-client relationships—mostly contract law—, the question of how much influence is welcome, and in which ways it can be channelled. The article provides ample material as to where similar questions have already been discussed in neighbouring fields of law and sees the regulatory package introduced under the term 'Banking Union' as one which will have a considerable amount of private law repercussions...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{implementation}} of the European <b>Union</b> <b>scheme</b> of preferential tariffs for developing countries under the Generalised System of Preferences during the past forty years shows that the scheme has made at best a modest contribution towards increasing the export earnings of India and other beneficiary countries covered by the standard GSP. The benefits for these countries have been constrained by the shallow cuts in tariffs for important products and the practice of product/sector graduation. The policy of differentiation among beneficiaries, which is a central pillar of the EU scheme, has resulted in deeper and wider preferences for GSP + countries and LDCs and limited the benefits for other developing countries. The reduction of MFN tariffs after successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations has diminished the value of the GSP concessions. If there is accord in the current trade talks in the WTO, the general level of MFN tariffs will be in the range of 3 - 4 per cent, rendering preferential tariffs even less consequential. It is unfortunate that at present, the prospect for conclusion of the Doha Round appears to be dim. In light of this, perhaps a better bet is forging ahead with the bilateral trade and investment agreement that India and the EU have been negotiating since 2007. A deal on this front might bring home advantage on the tariff front vis-à-vis the EU that is bigger than what the Doha Round can offer...|$|E

Many papers stated that the formation of the Malayan Union Constitution 1946 does not cause any reaction, issues and claims as well as opposition from the non-Malays because they are the beneficiaries of this scheme, particularly in terms of citizenship rights. But actually if examined, political involvement and citizenship awareness of the non-Malays actually began earlier, led by Tan Cheng Lock (TCL). Thus, this paper will examine first, the role of TCL in shaping up the Malayan citizenship during that time and second, the issues and claims presented by TCL on Malayan Citizenship. The primary source materials exclusively collected from the National Archive Kuala Lumpur, London National Archives and Australia National Archive were used to complete the study. The findings showed that TCL as Chinese leader is the one who insistently demanding the full status, rights and privileges of Malayan citizenship to which he assumed they are entitled. From the view point of TCL, those who are loyal and do their duty to the country in the hour of its danger, whatever their race may be, should be given full rights of citizenship in consonance with the dictates of natural justice and morality, human reason and the law of the nations...|$|E
