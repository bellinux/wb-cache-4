50|$|From {{representing}} the six special cases, {{we see a}} clear advantage of the moment matrix representation, i.e., it allows a <b>unified</b> <b>representation</b> for seemingly diverse types of knowledge, including linear equations, joint and conditional distributions, and ignorance. The unification is significant not only for knowledge representation in artificial intelligence but also for statistical analysis and engineering computation. For example, the representation treats the typical logical and probabilistic components in statistics — observations, distributions, improper priors (for Bayesian statistics), and linear equation models — not as separate concepts, but as manifestations of a single concept. It allows one to see the inner connections between these concepts or manifestations and to interplay them for computational purposes.|$|E

The European community remained the preferred field of action for Luxembourgish diplomacy. Several times in the past, the Grand Duchy's political representatives had been appointed to posts of high responsibility in the Union. On 10 September 2004, the Prime Minister and Minister for Finances, Jean-Claude Juncker, was elected by his European colleagues to president of the Eurogroup, the informal group for finance ministers of the members of the Eurozone. His mandate was renewed in 2006 and in 2008, for two years each time. The Eurogroup, although an informal organisation, played an important role in coordinating the budget policies of the Eurozone member states. The function of the Eurogroup's president allowed Juncker to regularly join in meetings of the G7 and of the International Monetary Fund to assure a <b>unified</b> <b>representation</b> of the Eurozone within international bodies.|$|E

50|$|Language is also {{relevant}} in {{the differences between}} spatial representations across species. A number of species in addition to humans are able to represent information spatially. For instance, when {{they are allowed to}} orient themselves and are then disoriented, many species, like mice and birds, are able to reorient themselves. Spatial representations are used preferentially, while non-spatial information is ignored, even if it is highly salient or would be relevant to the situation at hand. For example, when remembering a specific corner of a room, length and shape of walls will be referred to but the color of the walls is often ignored. Evidence has been found that spatial representations occur in a specific area of the brain across species, most likely the hippocampus. Humans differ from other species in spatial representations, in that language allows us to hold more stable spatial representations in memory such that they can be shared with others. Language helps to enhance memory of spatial representations but doesn’t dramatically change them. In essence, language makes encoding more efficient, in that people can remember spatial representation in single phrases (e.g. {{to the right of the}} blue wall), rather than in mental images of the space itself. It allows humans to create a more <b>unified</b> <b>representation</b> of geometric and non-geometric info than other species.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the popular}} essay [...] "Brain Time", by David Eagleman, he {{explains}} that different types of sensory information (auditory, tactile, visual, etc.) are processed at different speeds by different neural architectures. The brain must learn how to overcome these speed disparities {{if it is to}} create a temporally <b>unified</b> <b>representation</b> of the external world: [...] "if the visual brain wants to get events correct timewise, it may have only one choice: wait for the slowest information to arrive. To accomplish this, it must wait about a tenth of a second. In the early days of television broadcasting, engineers worried about the problem of keeping audio and video signals synchronized. Then they accidentally discovered that they had around a hundred milliseconds of slop: As long as the signals arrived within this window, viewers' brains would automatically resynchronize the signals". He {{goes on to say that}} [...] "This brief waiting period allows the visual system to discount the various delays imposed by the early stages; however, it has the disadvantage of pushing perception into the past. There is a distinct survival advantage to operating as close to the present as possible; an animal does not want to live too far in the past. Therefore, the tenth-of- a-second window may be the smallest delay that allows higher areas of the brain to account for the delays created in the first stages of the system while still operating near the border of the present. This window of delay means that awareness is postdictive, incorporating data from a window of time after an event and delivering a retrospective interpretation of what happened." ...|$|E

In order {{to get rid of the}} heterogeneity of devices, a <b>unified</b> <b>representation</b> of devices is needed. The <b>unified</b> <b>representation</b> describes not only the composition of devices including hardware components and software components, but details of the external accessible interfaces and other important information such as the location and device type.

More importantly, discrepancies among physical devices can be hidden by using the uniformed representation.|$|E

40|$|In the {{mammalian}} primary visual cortex, {{the corpus}} callosum {{contributes to the}} unification of the visual hemifields that project to the two hemispheres. Its development depends on visual experience. When the latter is abnormal, callosal connections must undergo dramatic anatomical and physiological changes. However, such data are sparse and incomplete. Thus, {{little is known about}} the consequences of abnormal postnatal visual experience on the development of callosal connections and their role in <b>unifying</b> <b>representation</b> of the two hemifields. Here, the effects of early unilateral convergent strabismus (a model of abnormal visual experience) were fully characterized with respect to the development of the callosal connections in cat visual cortex, an experimental model for humans. Electrophysiological responses and 3 D reconstruction of single callosal axons show that abnormally asymmetrical callosal connections develop after unilateral convergent strabismus, resulting from an extension of axonal branches of specific orders in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the deviated eye and a decreased number of nodes and terminals in the other (ipsilateral to the non deviated eye). Furthermore this asymmetrical organization prevents the establishment of a <b>unifying</b> <b>representation</b> of the two visual hemifields. As a general rule, we suggest that crossed and uncrossed retino-geniculo-cortical pathways contribute in succession to the development of the callosal maps in visual cortex...|$|R
