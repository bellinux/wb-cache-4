40|$|Qualification of the {{full-scale}} {{process and}} design changes for elimination of redesigned solid rocket motor tang nitrile butadiene rubber insulation edge separations and voids was performed from 24 March to 3 December 1990. The objectives of this test were: to qualify design and process changes on flight hardware using a tie ply between the redesigned solid rocket motor steel {{case and the}} nitrile butadiene rubber insulation over the tang capture features; to qualify the use of methyl ethyl ketone in the tang flap region to reduce voids; and to determine if holes in the separator film reduce voids in the tang flap region. The tie ply is intended to aid insulation flow during the insulation cure process, and thus reduce or eliminate edge <b>unbonds.</b> Methyl ethyl ketone is intended to reduce voids in the tang flap area by providing better tacking characteristics. The perforated film was intended to provide possible vertical breathe paths to reduce voids in the tang area. Tang tie ply testing consisted of 270 deg of the tang circumference using a new layup method and 90 deg of the tang circumference using the current layup methods. Tie ply process success {{was defined as a}} reduction of insulation <b>unbonds.</b> Lack of any insulation edge <b>unbonds</b> on the tang area where the new process was used, and the presence of 17 <b>unbonds</b> with the current process, proves the test to be a success. Successful completion of this test has qualified the new processes...|$|R

2500|$|Partition {{chromatography}} {{was one of}} {{the first}} kinds of chromatography that chemists developed. The partition coefficient principle has been applied in paper chromatography, thin layer chromatography, gas phase and liquidâ€“liquid separation applications. The 1952 Nobel Prize in chemistry was earned by Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge for their development of the technique, which was used for their separation of amino acids. Partition chromatography uses a retained solvent, on the surface or within the grains or fibers of an [...] "inert" [...] solid supporting matrix as with paper chromatography; or takes advantage of some coulombic and/or hydrogen donor interaction with the stationary phase. Analyte molecules partition between a liquid stationary phase and the eluent. Just as in Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC; a sub-technique within HPLC), this method separates analytes based on differences in their polarity. HILIC most often uses a bonded polar stationary phase and a mobile phase made primarily of acetonitrile with water as the strong component. Partition HPLC has been used historically on <b>unbonded</b> silica or alumina supports. Each works effectively for separating analytes by relative polar differences. HILIC bonded phases have the advantage of separating acidic, basic and neutral solutes in a single chromatographic run.|$|E

Testing was performed at M- 111, the Thiokol Corp. Inert Parts Preparation Building. The purpose of the inspection was to verify {{the integrity of the}} capture feature area case-to-insulation bondline. The capture feature scanner was calibrated over an intentional 1. 0 to 1. 0 in. case-to-insulation <b>unbond.</b> The capture feature scanner was then used to scan 60 deg of a capture feature field joint. Calibration of the capture feature scanner was then rechecked over the intentional <b>unbond</b> to ensure that the calibration settings did not change during the case scan. This procedure was successfully performed five times to qualify the <b>unbond</b> detection capability of the capture feature scanner. The capture feature scanner qualified in this test contains many points of mechanical instability that can affect the overall ultrasonic signal response. A new generation scanner, designated the sigma scanner, should be implemented to replace the current configuration scanner.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the thermal protection system, field joint protection system, and systems tunnel components of Flight Set 360 L 006, are documented, as evaluated by postflight hardware inspection. The condition of both motors was similar to previous flights. Sixteen aft edge hits were noted on the ground environment instrumentation thermal protection system. Each hit left a clean substrate, indicating that the damage was caused by nozzle severance debris and/or water impact. No National Space and Transporation System debris criteria for missing thermal protection system were violated. One 5. 0 by 1. 0 in. <b>unbond</b> was observed on the left hand center field joint K 5 NA closeout and was elevated to an in-flight anomaly (STS- 34 -M- 4) by the NASA Ice/Debris team. Aft edge damage to the K 5 NA and an associated black streak indicate that burning debris from the nozzle severance system was the likely cause of the damage. Minor divots caused by debris were seen on previous flights, {{but this is the}} first occurrence of a K 5 NA <b>unbond.</b> Since the <b>unbond</b> occurred after booster separation there is no impact on flight safety and no corrective actions was taken. The right hand center field joint primary heater failed the dielectric withstanding voltage test after joint closeout.

40|$|Improved {{methods of}} {{adhesive}} joining for constructing structural elements {{have led to}} an increase in the use of bonding. Bonding is already widely used in the aerospace industry. It allows potential for greater weight and manufacturing cost savings when compared to mechanical fastening as well as providing better fatigue resistant capabilities. More accurate design or life prediction based on a better understanding of adhesive joint failure will allow far more extensive and safer use of adhesively bonded structures. The possibility of time dependent failure is introduced in bonding,by the fact that many adhesives are polymers and measurably viscoelastic under many circumstances. Failure can occur by <b>unbonding</b> at the adherend-adhesive interface or totally within the adhesive. Here the time dependent failure by <b>unbonding</b> at the interface is addressed as one initial investigation of the whole problem. In many engineering problems the modelling of failure has been based on linear fracture mechanics. The extent to which the use of the linear theory can be justified is often questionable in view of the nonlinearity of the local crack front deformation field. One aspect of the current investigation is therefore the measurement of the local crack front deformation to examine the limits of the validity for the linear theory and to provide a basis for future modelling, Within this framework, particular attention is paid to the aspects of local failure mode interaction and the time dependence of the <b>unbonding</b> process. The small displacements in the crack front region require a resolution on the order of a wavelength of light. The experimental techniques used are therefore based on optical interferometry. The displacements applied to the adherends are controlled to the same order by a novel, thermally actuated servoloading device. The thesis is divided into three distinct parts. The first part deals with the development of the experimental techniques used to measure the unbound profiles as well as to measure and control the displacements applied to the adherends. For stationary cracks, the second part describes experiments which examine the extent of the nonlinearity in the crack front deformation field while fracture criteria are developed and compared for <b>unbonding</b> rates in steadily propagating cracks. Finally, proposals for improvement of the experimental techniques and further experiments are discussed in the third part...|$|R

40|$|Many {{engineering}} structures {{are made of}} composite materials and include, for example, a protective coating or a bonded layer. We have developed a novel technique, similar to laser-ultrasonics that allows the detection of disbonds between the coating or the bonded layer and the substrate. The technique is also applicable to the detection of <b>unbonds</b> in honeycomb structures. The technique {{is based on the}} thermoelastic excitation by a laser pulse of the top layer or top skin which is driven into vibration if it is detached from the substrate underneath. This vibration is then detected by a second laser coupled to a photorefractive interferometer. This detection laser is a single frequency, very stable laser, which delivers optical pulses of a few hundred of microseconds, long enough to capture the low frequency membrane vibrations of the disbonded layers. Photorefractive interferometers allow processing these low frequencies while keeping the system insensitive to ambient vibrations. One of the most promising applications is the in-service inspection of aerospace structures for the detection of core <b>unbonds</b> in honeycombs or near surface delaminations.
