5|$|Six years later, the US25 {{designation}} was decommissioned in Michigan, {{although all}} sections {{of it are}} still state highways. The southern section from the state line northward through Monroe was renumbered M-125 and the US25 designation was removed from US24 (Telegraph Road). In the Detroit area, the connection between US24 and I-75 in Woodhaven was redesignated as an <b>unsigned</b> connector highway (now Connector 24). The US25 designation was removed from I-75 northward into Detroit, while the routing along Clark Street became an <b>unsigned</b> connector highway (now Connector 850). The routing along Fort Street and Gratiot Avenue was numbered as M-3. The US25 designation was removed from I-94, and the routing through Port Huron and northward to Port Austin became part of an extended M-25. One segment of highway near Port Huron became an <b>unsigned</b> highway now designed Connector 25.|$|E
5|$|The Online Music Awards are a multi-genre global awards {{ceremony}} in which <b>unsigned</b> musicians are rewarded and celebrated. Björk has received three awards from six nominations.|$|E
5|$|Akins {{declared}} for the 1999 NFL Draft, {{where he}} went <b>unsigned.</b> The Buffalo Bills later signed him to fill their final roster slot at wide receiver in training camp. In late August, they released Akins {{prior to the start}} of the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not much}} {{is known about}} Maya scribes, some did sign their work, both on {{ceramics}} and on stone sculpture. Usually, only a single scribe signed a ceramic vessel, but multiple sculptors {{are known to have}} recorded their names on stone sculpture; eight sculptors signed one stela at Piedras Negras. However, most works remained <b>unsigned</b> by their artists.|$|E
5|$|As {{the highway}} heads north from the {{channels}} surrounding {{the west end}} of South Oyster Bay, it runs along {{the west side of the}} Norman J. Levy Park and Preserve and the Merrick Road Park Golf Course, both of which are separated from the Meadowbrook by a small creek. The golf course leads to nearby exitM9, a cloverleaf interchange with Merrick Road (<b>unsigned</b> County Route27 or CR27) in the Freeport section of Hempstead. Not far to the north is exitM8, another cloverleaf serving NY27 (East Sunrise Highway). After crossing the adjacent Babylon Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, the parkway continues north across East Meadow Park to reach exitM7, a cloverleaf interchange with the Babylon Turnpike (<b>unsigned</b> CR7A). After exitM7, the Meadowbrook makes a slight turn to the northwest as it traverses Roosevelt Preserve County Park.|$|E
5|$|At Broadway (NY17K), Newburgh's main street, NY32 turns east. The brief, <b>unsigned</b> {{concurrency}} ends where 17K terminates at US9W (Robinson Avenue), at {{the former}} Broadway School. NY32, however, turns north again, beginning {{the first of several}} concurrencies with US9W.|$|E
5|$|Connector 104 is an <b>unsigned</b> {{trunkline}} in Ferrysburg {{that runs}} north along Pine Street and west along 3rd Street to connect exit104B on US31 to M-104. According to MDOT, 14,231vehicles used the trunkline on average each day.|$|E
5|$|Continuing west, the Meadowbrook State Parkway enters exitM2, a {{cloverleaf}} interchange with Zeckendorf Boulevard (<b>unsigned</b> CR260) {{adjacent to}} nearby Roosevelt Field Mall. Both directions of Zeckendorf Boulevard are accessible southbound, with exitM2E using part of Dibblee Drive; the northbound {{direction of the}} parkway has only one exit, exitM2W for Zeckendorf Boulevard westbound. Past the cloverleaf, the parkway winds back to the northwest as it approaches exitM1, a partial cloverleaf interchange with Old Country Road (<b>unsigned</b> CR25) {{on the border between}} the towns of Hempstead and North Hempstead. The Meadowbrook Parkway continues northwest across Old Country Road into North Hempstead, passing under the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line as it traverses the village of Carle Place. Just north of the community, the Meadowbrook reaches exit31A of the Northern State Parkway, a semi-directional T interchange that serves as {{the north end of the}} Meadowbrook State Parkway.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{when the}} Jeffries Freeway (I-96) was completed, M-14 was {{shortened}} {{to have its}} eastern terminus at I-275 exit28 in Plymouth Township, and the portion of Plymouth Road within the city of Detroit was returned to local control. The portion of Plymouth Road–Ann Arbor Road between I-275 and the city boundary with Redford Township was retained as an <b>unsigned</b> trunkline, maintained {{by the state to}} this day. In 1979, the final segment of the M-14 freeway, between M-153 and I-275 was completed. The former route of M-14 in Washtenaw County along Plymouth–Ann Arbor Road was returned to local control. The portion of Ann Arbor Road from the Wayne County line east to I-275 also became an <b>unsigned</b> state trunkline, also still maintained by MDOT.|$|E
5|$|In {{adjacent}} Fulton County, NY30 crosses NY29 near Broadalbin, then curves {{gently to}} the east after an intersection with County Route155 (CR155), a historical routing of NY29. , NY30 turns left toward Mayfield; CR155 continues eastward. The concurrency between the two routes is <b>unsigned.</b>|$|E
5|$|M-125 {{starts at}} the state line as the {{continuation}} of Detroit Avenue running northward from Toledo. Once across the state line, the roadway takes on the Dixie Highway name and passes a residential subdivision. The highway runs north-northeasterly roughly parallel with, and between, both US24 and I-75 through farm land in rural Monroe County. The trunkline passes through the community of Erie before intersecting with Conn. M-125 (Summit Street) north of town. That <b>unsigned</b> connector is a state highway that links M-125 with I-75 to the south. Continuing north, M-125 intersects Luna Pier Road, which to the west is the <b>unsigned</b> Conn. US24 that offers a path to US24 (Telegraph Road).|$|E
5|$|PHP stores {{integers}} in a platform-dependent range, {{either a}} 64-bit or 32-bit signed integer {{equivalent to the}} C-language long type. <b>Unsigned</b> integers are converted to signed values in certain situations; this behavior {{is different from that}} of other programming languages. Integer variables can be assigned using decimal (positive and negative), octal, hexadecimal, and binary notations.|$|E
5|$|State Route 275 (SR 275) {{is a short}} <b>unsigned</b> {{state highway}} in the Sacramento area of the U.S. state of California. The highway is {{currently}} defined to be {{the length of the}} Tower Bridge between West Sacramento and downtown Sacramento.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} US 82 to MS 1 was {{constructed}} during 1940, and opened in 1941. The road was <b>unsigned,</b> and was already paved in concrete. It was designated as MS 454 by 1953. By 1999, US 278 became concurrent with US 82 through MS 454's western terminus. A bypass around Greenville has been planned in the 1990s, and construction began in 2008. It was partially built before funding stopped. A bridge for MS 454's future alignment has been built, with no roads connecting to it.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} {{northwest of the}} interchange, NY132 reaches a junction with {{the eastern end of}} East Main Street (<b>unsigned</b> County Route1309 (CR1309)). Two blocks north of East Main Street, NY132 enters a junction with US6 in the hamlet of Shrub Oak. This junction marks the northern terminus of NY132, whose right-of-way continues north through Yorktown as Barger Street, connecting to the Putnam County line.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} Allegany County, I-68 bypasses Frostburg to the south, {{with two}} exits, one to Midlothian Road (<b>unsigned</b> MD736) {{and one to}} MD36. Near the MD36 exit is God's Ark of Safety church, which {{is known for its}} attempt to build a replica of Noah's Ark. This replica, which currently consists of a steel frame, can be seen from I-68.|$|E
5|$|After {{paralleling}} {{the reservoir}} {{for almost two}} miles (3km), a third route, US6, joins the concurrency {{just east of the}} village of Brewster. The three routes cross under a high, long bridge carrying I-84, then veer east to an interchange with the north end of I-684. US6 and 202 continue east for Danbury while NY22 uses the northbound on-ramp of the I-684 roadway. The short expressway connector that carries northbound I-684 traffic to northbound NY22 is NY981B, an <b>unsigned</b> reference route.|$|E
5|$|Altrincham has its {{own music}} festival {{that takes place in}} August. The Goose Green Festival takes place over the August bank holiday weekend in the Goose Green area of Altrincham, and {{features}} a number of <b>unsigned</b> bands, local food and drink and entertainment for all the family. 2017 was the biggest festival to date, with 16 artists playing over two days. The headline acts were The Jade Assembly on the Saturday, and The Rainband on the Sunday.|$|E
5|$|Approaching I-96 {{from the}} south, the freeway passes {{east of the}} DeltaPlex Arena, and it median widens further {{across the river from}} Comstock Riverside Park in Walker. An extra lane is added on the left, {{widening}} the freeway to four lanes. <b>Unsigned</b> I-296 occupies the left two lanes that form the left exit for I-96 from US131. At the split between I-296 and US131, I-296 curves northwest, and US131 curves northeast to follow a bend in the Grand River. Once I-296 diverges from US131, the highway crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation and passes over West River Drive. To the northwest of these crossings, exits emerge on the right for eastbound I-96 and the left for northbound M-37 (Alpine Avenue). Past these exits, I-296 merges into westbound I-96 and terminates. Southbound <b>unsigned</b> I-296 begins where the ramps to US131 southbound split from eastbound I-96 at the Alpine Avenue overpass, merging with southbound US131 north of Ann Street.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the swap, all of NY386 north of NY33A—except for the section that {{overlaps}} NY33—is overlapped by <b>unsigned</b> county routes. The portion of NY386 on Chili Center–Coldwater Road is co-designated as CR256. Along Westside Drive, NY386 is part of CR119, the designation for all of Westside Drive. The Coldwater Road segment, meanwhile, is also CR198 while CR158 was extended north to cover all of Elmgrove Road.|$|E
5|$|As {{it existed}} at the time, M-144 started at the {{headquarters}} for the Michigan State Police next to the campus of Michigan State College, now Michigan State University. The highway ran north along Harrison Road next to campus and across the Red Cedar River. North of the river, the trunkline terminated at the junction with Michigan Avenue (then M-39, now the <b>unsigned</b> M-143).|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{creation}} of the Capitol Loop, M-143 and Michigan Avenue in Lansing was partially transferred back to local control. The section between Cedar and Larch streets was retained as part of the new Capitol Loop and the remainder inside the city of Lansing was removed from the state trunkline highway system on October 13, 1989. At the time, M-143 in the City of East Lansing was not transferred, and MDOT removed the signage, creating an <b>unsigned</b> trunkline.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway23 (Bus. US23) was a {{business}} route through downtown Fenton. At {{the time it was}} turned over to local control, it was signed as business spur from downtown to the US23 freeway, but the state maintained a southern section that previously completed the route as a loop. At the southern end, this <b>unsigned</b> highway started at US23 at the Owen Road interchange (exit78) and continued eastward on Owen Road past Fenton High School and various businesses. At the intersection with Shiawassee Avenue, Bus. US23 followed Shiawassee through a residential area toward the southern end of downtown. At the intersection with LeRoy Street, the <b>unsigned</b> business loop turned northward and across the Shiawassee River. At the intersection with River Street, state maintenance ended. On the northern end of downtown at the intersection of LeRoy Street and Silver Lake Road, it resumed. Bus. US23 followed Silver Lake Road westward out of downtown through a residential area and northwesterly to an interchange with US23 at exit79.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, {{a portion}} of present-day Highway63 from Boyle to Atmore had been {{constructed}} as an <b>unsigned</b> gravel road that formed part of the route from Athabasca to the western shore of Lac La Biche. By the mid-1950s, this section formed part of Highway46 which ran from Township Road590 (then Highway28) near Radway to the hamlet of Lac La Biche along the present alignment of Highway63 through Abee, Newbrook and Boyle. Highway46 had been re-signed as Highways55 and 63 {{by the end of}} the decade.|$|E
5|$|By 1954, NY12 and NY28 were shifted westward onto a new bypass {{around the}} village of Remsen. NY28B was {{extended}} southward along NY12 and NY28's former alignment on Main Street and westward on Steuben Street to meet the new highway. The NY28B designation was eliminated in the mid-1960s and replaced with NY920V, an <b>unsigned</b> reference route. Around the same time, NY287 was realigned onto the bypass that now carries NY365 around the northern fringe of {{the village of}} Prospect, truncating NY920V to its current length.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{surviving}} documentation, {{it is difficult to}} attribute <b>unsigned</b> works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E
5|$|He {{represented}} <b>unsigned</b> players Kaman, Fisher, Ariza, and Johnson; team option Drummand and Williams; qualifying offer player Davis. Kaman {{signed a}} two-year $9.8 million contract {{to play for}} the Portland Trail Blazers. Fisher signed a 5-year $25 million contract to be head coach for the New York Knicks. Ariza agreed to a 4-year $32 million contract {{to play for the}} Houston Rockets. Late in the year, Drummond left Pelinka for Jeff Schwartz.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, the New York State Legislature created Route43, an <b>unsigned</b> {{legislative}} route {{extending from}} the southern village line of Stillwater to the western village line of Schuylerville via the hamlet of Quaker Springs. On March 1, 1921, Route43 was renumbered to Route44 to eliminate numerical duplication with another legislative Route43 in western New York. At the same time, Route44 was extended southwest from Stillwater to Clifton Park via Mechanicville and west from Schuylerville to Saratoga Springs.|$|E
5|$|In Elbridge, NY321 intersects {{with several}} county routes, {{including}} Halfway Road (CR107; former NY368), a connector highway {{leading to the}} hamlet of Halfway. Soon afterwards, NY321 turns to the northeast, heading towards NY5. The highway intersects Forward Road (<b>unsigned</b> NY931F) just inside the Camillus town line soon after the turn. Forward Road, a local road that passes through a mixture of open fields and forests, serves as a connector between NY321 and NY174.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, a {{privilege}} escalation exploit {{was discovered in}} the Windows kernel that can allow <b>unsigned</b> code to run under Windows RT; the exploit involved {{the use of a}} remote debugging tool (provided by Microsoft to debug WinRT apps on Windows RT devices) to execute code which changes the signing level stored in RAM to allow <b>unsigned</b> code to execute (by default, it is set to a level that only allows code signed by Microsoft to execute). Alongside his explanation of the exploit, the developer also included a personal appeal to Microsoft urging them to remove the restrictions on Windows RT devices, contending that their decision was not for technical reasons, and that the devices would be more valuable if this functionality were available. In a statement, a Microsoft spokesperson applauded the effort, indicating that the exploit does not pose a security threat because it requires administrative access to the device, advanced techniques, and would still require programs to be re-compiled for ARM. However, Microsoft has still indicated that the exploit would be patched in a future update.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{being part of the}} state highway system (as a portion of the <b>unsigned</b> Sacramento-Los Angeles Legislative Route 4), the road was also part of the National Park to Park Highway, a privately designated auto trail, and became part of US 99 in 1926. The continuation south via Saugus and the Newhall Tunnel towards Los Angeles, also part of Route 4, was added to the state highway system in 1917.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{the portion}} of Browncroft Boulevard from the Sea Breeze Expressway to Blossom Road was {{upgraded}} into a divided highway. NY286 was rerouted to follow the improved Browncroft Boulevard while NY286A was shifted south onto NY286's former alignment along Blossom Road. The NY286A designation was removed in the early 1970s, but Blossom Road remains state-maintained as NY941V, an <b>unsigned</b> reference route.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of Massena, NY37B intersects North Main Street, which connects to NY420 south of the village. The portion of Main Street between NY420 and NY37B is {{maintained}} by the New York State Department of Transportation as NY970B, an <b>unsigned</b> reference route. Past North Main Street, NY37B follows Maple Street southeast to Center Street. The route merges with Center Street and becomes a divided highway as it connects to Willow Street by way of an interchange and intersects an eastward extension of Center Street.|$|E
