25|$|Determining {{the forces}} {{required}} to move atoms {{past each other}} is a challenge in designing nanomachines. In 2008 scientists {{for the first time}} were able to move a single atom across a surface, and measure the forces required. Using <b>ultrahigh</b> vacuum and nearly zero temperature (5 K), a modified atomic force microscope was used to drag a cobalt atom, and a carbon monoxide molecule, across surfaces of copper and platinum.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} of the MALDI technology and comparable instruments are today produced for very different purposes. From more academic and analytical, to more industrial and high throughput. The MS field has expanded into requiring <b>ultrahigh</b> resolution mass spectrometry such as the FT-ICR instruments {{as well as more}} high-throughput instruments. As many MALDI MS instruments can be bought with an interchangeable ionization source (Electrospray ionization, MALDI, Atmospheric pressure ionization, etc.) the technologies often overlap and many times any soft ionization method could potentially be used. For more variations of soft ionization methods go to Soft laser desorption or Ion source.|$|E
25|$|Then, data {{gathered}} by the orbital experiments ERA, BIOPAN, EXOSTACK and EXPOSE, determined that isolated spores, including those of B. subtilis, were killed by several orders of magnitude if exposed to the full space environment for a mere few seconds, but if shielded against solar UV, the spores were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years while embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites). Though minimal protection is required to shelter a spore against UV radiation, exposure to solar UV and cosmic ionizing radiation of unprotected DNA, break it up into its bases. Also, exposing DNA to the <b>ultrahigh</b> vacuum of space alone is sufficient to cause DNA damage, so the transport of unprotected DNA or RNA during interplanetary flights powered solely by light pressure is extremely unlikely. The feasibility of other means of transport for the more massive shielded spores into the outer Solar System – for example, through gravitational capture by comets – is at this time unknown.|$|E

2500|$|Yue, et al. used {{a type of}} new materials, called topological insulators, to {{increase}} the absorption of ultrathin a-Si solar cells. The topological insulator nanostructure has intrinsically core-shell configuration. The core is dielectric and has <b>ultrahigh</b> refractive index. The shell is metallic and support surface plasmon resonances. Through integrating the nanocone arrays into a-Si thin film solar cells, up to 15% enhancement of light absorption was predicted in the ultraviolet and visible ranges.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of such applications is {{the mission of}} vacuum nanoelectronics. However, field emitters work best in conditions of good <b>ultrahigh</b> vacuum. Their most successful applications to date (FEM, FES and EM guns) have occurred in these conditions. The sad fact remains that field emitters and industrial vacuum conditions do not go well together, and the related problems of reliably ensuring good [...] "vacuum robustness" [...] of field emission sources used in such conditions still await better solutions (probably cleverer materials solutions) than we currently have.|$|E
2500|$|Dönitz {{revived the}} World War I idea of {{grouping}} several submarines {{together into a}} [...] "wolfpack" [...] to overwhelm a merchant convoy's defensive escorts. Implementation of wolfpacks had been difficult in World War I owing to the limitations of available radios. In the interwar years, Germany had developed <b>ultrahigh</b> frequency transmitters which it was hoped would make their radio communication unjammable, while the Enigma cipher machine was believed to have made communications secure. Dönitz also adopted and claimed credit for Wilhelm Marschall's 1922 idea of attacking convoys using surface or very-near-the-surface night attacks. This tactic had the added advantage of making a submarine undetectable by sonar.|$|E
