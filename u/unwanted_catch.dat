40|$|A key {{objective}} of the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy reforms is the elimination of discards {{and a reduction in}} <b>unwanted</b> <b>catches.</b> Combining a discard ban with catch quotas, where all fish, independent of size, count towards quotas could create economic incentives for more selective fishing, reducing <b>unwanted</b> <b>catches.</b> We use fishing activities data from English North Sea otter trawlers to examine the impact of these measures on this fleet. Initial impacts depend on the scale of increase and distribution of quotas and are unevenly distributed, depending on catch and discard characteristics of vessels. Selective fishing will be rewarded as vessels that currently have low discards could increase catches and profits. Fishing by less selective vessels will be curtailed, reducing profits by 1 – 14 %. This could be partially mitigated through reducing regulated catches but will require changes to fishing patterns as using currently available selective fishing gears may impact on profitability. So, catch quotas and a discard ban create strong incentives for more selective fishing practices, but also for non-compliance with full documentation of catches. A high level of monitoring and enforcement will be required to ensure that fishers improve profitability through more selective fishing practices rather than illegal discarding...|$|R

A general discard ban is {{currently}} being introduced within the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union.  The gradual implementation of this landing obligation (LO) started {{in the beginning of}} 2015 and is to apply to all fisheries within the EU by the beginning of year 2019. A major challenge related with the implementation of the LO is how to deal with unavoidable, <b>unwanted</b> <b>catches</b> (UUC) on-board fishing vessels and how to establish applicable incentives or enforcement mechanisms to ensure that UUC are landed. The focus on UUC on-board fishing vessels within EU has mainly been on monitoring, control and surveillance, where Fully Documented Fisheries have been at the forefront. There has however not been much attention given to what can be done with the <b>unwanted</b> <b>catches</b> once they have been taken aboard the fishing vessels. This paper addresses these challenges, identifying available alternatives and technologies, as well as their applicability within selected EU fisheries. The paper also identifies solutions already in use in fisheries with long and successful experiences of discard bans.

Building on Results Based Management principles, RFMS involves the definition of specific and measurable objectives for a fishery by the relevant authorities but allows resource users the freedom to find ways to achieve the objectives and to provide adequate documentation. Taking into account the main goals of the new Common Fisheries Policy, such as sustainable utilization of the resources, end of discards and <b>unwanted</b> <b>catches,</b> a management plan for the Portuguese crustacean trawl fishery was developed in cooperation with the fishing industry, following the process and design laid out in the RFMS concept. The plan considers biological, social and economic goals and assigns a responsibility for increased data collection to the resource users. The performance of the plan with regard to selected indicators was evaluated through simulations. In this paper the process towards a RFMS is described and the lessons learnt from the interaction with stakeholders in the development of an alternative management plan are discussed.

Put simply, discards are an <b>unwanted</b> <b>catch.</b> They could be fish that are of no commercial value, fish that are below the legal landing size, fish for which a vessel has no quota (or for which their quote share has run out), damaged or spoiled fish, or other organisms of no value.

The proposed EU Common Fisheries Policy reform, to be implemented in 2014, sets out a gradual elimination of discards by reducing <b>unwanted</b> <b>catches</b> and ensuring that all catches are landed. To develop successful discard mitigation measures it is necessary to identify the reasons for discarding. Here we have developed a simple model that can be applied to data from observer programmes to establish the contribution of different drivers of discarding behaviour. The analysis makes inferences on the causes of discarding by partitioning discards into four categories based on the length of the fish and the associated regulatory restrictions. The drivers are defined as: fish discarded below the legal minimum landing size; fish {{for which there is no}} market and that do not have a MLS (minimum landing size); fish for which there are inconsistencies in market and sorting practices; and discards that can be attributed to fishermen’s responses to quota restrictions. The approach is applied to data generated from observer programmes from five European Member States. All of the inferred drivers contribute to the total discard quantity. Their relative contributions vary widely across countries, areas, gears and species. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|R

40|$|Discarding, or {{returning}} <b>unwanted</b> <b>catch</b> to the sea, is {{a common}} feature of European fisheries, and is widely acknowledged as morally wrong. It wastes food and economic resources, and has contributed to overfishing in EU stocks. However, under the current Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), catch that is below minimum landings sizes, exceeds quota, or does not match catch composition regulations must be discarded. The high profile of discarding {{in recent years has}} put pressure on the European Commission (EC) to reform the CFP. A key objective is to eliminate discards and reduce unwanted catches. A discard ban and catch quotas for regulated species will be implemented. The EC argues that this will create strong incentives for more selective fishing, but little supporting evidence from EC fisheries is available. This thesis aims to present such evidence. A desk based analysis of a number of global fisheries found that a discard ban in isolation created little or no incentive to avoid unwanted catches; supporting measures were required to encourage more selective fishing practices. Analysis of the potential impact of introducing a discard ban on English North Sea otter trawlers supported this finding. Models using economic, logbook and observer data showed that the cost of capturing <b>unwanted</b> <b>catch</b> is minimal unless a cap is placed on total catches. Catch quotas cap fishing mortality, creating a strong incentive to reduce catches of limiting species. This incentive is unequally distributed between and within fleets, and is strongest for the least selective vessels. If catch compositions are not adjusted to match available quota, substantial reductions in revenue could occur. So under the reformed CFP discards of regulated species could be eliminated, the cost of catching unwanted fish will be passed onto the fishers, and strong incentives for more selective fishing practices will be generated...|$|E

A relative difference between values showed a resistance of the mesh to bend, and the results were fitted into an existing analytical solution. The geometric parameters of nets were measured applying a digital photogrammetric method. Four prawn trawls built from the netting being assessed for flexural rigidity were examined in a flume tank for drag and shape over a range of velocities. A stereo-vision system was developed to acquire the 3 D shape image. The net flexural rigidity and drag showed a piece-wise linear relationship.

Structured interviews were conducted with 173 fishers in 4 countries practicing 4 generic fisheries (as typified by the dominant fishing gear) asking a total of 26 questions. Results show that fishers estimate that the full implementation of the discards ban will result in longer sorting times. Added to the limited space on board, especially in the more productive trawl and purse seine vessels, this may lead to practical difficulties in relation to compliance. Most of the respondents estimate that there are no realistic possibilities of utilizing the formerly discarded fish in the short term, {{because of the lack of}} adequate infrastructure on land Furthermore, the possible utilization types foreseen in the regulation will not help offset the costs of bringing former discards to land.

40|$|Discarding in {{fisheries}} {{is believed}} to be a waste of natural resources, as it is the part of the total catch brought on board but then returned to the sea dead or alive for any reason. This study aims to advance knowledge of the discards associated with the deep water rose shrimp fisheries in the south-central Mediterranean Sea. We address this issue by examining the data collected within the module of commercial catch monitoring (Campbiol) of European data collection framework (DCF) between January 2009 and December 2013. Multivariate data analysis and the generalized additive model (GAMs) were used to assess the spatio-temporal composition of the discard and factors influencing its distribution. Overall, discard represented 32. 9 ± 15. 4 % of the total catch. Multiple analysis of variance highlighted the significant effect on discard assemblage only for the factor of depth (p-value < 0. 05). In general, bony fish were the most discarded organisms (23. 5 ± 14. 4 %). Cartilaginous fish, crustaceans and other invertebrates represented approximately 13 % of the total catch. The fraction of discard in the catch presented significant variation regarding the years, depth and fishing ground. Our results showed that most of the discards in the deep water rose shrimp (DPS) fisheries are due to species that have a minimum legal size (Hake, DPS, Trachurus spp.), and are consequently subjected to the discard ban (art. 15 of the reg. EU 1380 / 2013). To avoid the landing of discards, specific measures aimed to minimize the <b>unwanted</b> <b>catches</b> of undersized species should be implemented...|$|R
40|$|Reforms of the European Union Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) will {{implement}} an EU wide ban on discarding {{phased in}} from 2015, requiring the landing of unwanted small and unmarketable fish. The Commission argues {{that this will}} create strong incentives for more selective fishing practices; however, there is little information {{to allow us to}} predict likely changes in fishing behaviour. Using detailed historic observer and logbook data from English North Sea otter trawlers and information on fish prices and landing costs, we examine the potential impact of a discard ban combined with either effort controls or catch quotas on the landings of an average trip. We calculate fishing incomes {{based on the assumption that}} existing fishing behaviour and catch compositions are maintained and compare this with incomes calculated on the assumption that all <b>unwanted</b> <b>catch</b> can be avoided. The difference provides an estimate of the maximum possible financial incentive for fishers to adopt more selective fishing practices. The calculations suggest that a discard ban in isolation will generate little economic incentive to operate more selectively. When combined with effort controls, a reduction in fishing effort may result in a proportional reduction in unwanted catches, but an incentive to actively avoid this catch is unlikely to be generated. Catch quotas would generate much stronger economic incentives, but only for the avoidance of the five quota species. So, contrary to the aims of the reformed CFP, a discard ban may not result in a dramatic reduction in unmarketable catches of all species...|$|E
40|$|Commercial capture {{fisheries}} produce huge {{quantities of}} offal, {{as well as}} undersized and <b>unwanted</b> <b>catch</b> {{in the form of}} discards. Declines in global catches and legislation to ban discarding will significantly reduce discards, but this subsidy supports a large scavenger community. Understanding the potential impact of declining discards for scavengers should feature in an eco-system based approach to fisheries management, but requires greater knowledge of scavenger/fishery interactions. Here we use bird-borne cameras, in tandem with GPS loggers, to provide a unique view of seabird/fishery interactions. 20, 643 digital images (one min- 1) from ten bird-borne cameras deployed on central place northern gannets Morus bassanus revealed that all birds photographed fishing vessels. These were large (> 15 m) boats, with no small-scale vessels. Virtually all vessels were trawlers, and gannets were almost always accompanied by other scavenging birds. All individuals exhibited an Area-Restricted Search (ARS) during foraging, but only 42 % of ARS were associated with fishing vessels, indicating much 'natural' foraging. The proportion of ARS behaviours associated with fishing boats were higher for males (81 %) than females (30 %), although the reasons for this are currently unclear. Our study illustrates that fisheries form a very important component of the prey-landscape for foraging gannets and that a discard ban, such as that proposed under reforms of the EU Common Fisheries Policy, may {{have a significant impact on}} gannet behaviour, particularly males. However, a continued reliance on 'natural' foraging suggests the ability to switch away from scavenging, but only if there is sufficient food to meet their needs in the absence of a discard subsidy. © 2013 Votier et al...|$|E
40|$|Discard bans {{have been}} {{proposed}} as part of management policies aimed at balanced harvest (BH). Nationwide discard bans exist in several countries, including Chile, the European Union, Norway, and New Zealand. We analysed experiences from these countries {{to determine whether or}} not discard bans are in contradiction with BH, based on six aspects: policy objectives, species/sizes applicability, accompanying technical measures, at sea monitoring and control, and possible impacts. When discard bans are fully implemented, fishing operations change to more selective fishing, typically targeting bigger individuals of main commercial species. This is consistent with the primary objective of many discard policies, i. e. to reduce <b>unwanted</b> <b>catch.</b> In contrast, proponents of BH argue that broader catch diversity, a product of a widespread harvest strategy, should be sought to avoid major impacts on the ecosystem. Our analysis demonstrates that the scope of discard bans is often limited to main commercial species, although usually they can be extended to include more ecosystem components. Some of the policies examined also prohibit the use of unwanted catches for human consumption, thus limiting their effective use. However, the implementation of discard bans requires high levels of at-sea monitoring and effective control, and/or strong incentives to fish more selectively, neither of which applied in most cases examined. We conclude that if discard bans were set differently, they could contribute to fishery management policies aiming at BH. Their goals should be in line with BH, i. e. to reach a wider global harvest pattern, or at least be established within management regimes that promote high compliance. Finally, the extent to which a discard ban contributes to achieve BH depends also on the relative importance of the ecosystem benthic and megafauna components...|$|E

Here we present an experiment examining the influence of trap types, conventional cup traps vs. funnel traps, and of trap diameter on catches of carabid beetles, spiders and unwanted by-catches of small mammals. 3. The number of sampled carabid beetles increased significantly with diameter of the traps and presence of a funnel. The number of species was not affected by trap type or trap size. 4. For spiders, significantly more individuals and more species were found in larger traps. After correcting for difference in sample size by rarefaction, spider species number was still higher in larger traps. The use of a funnel {{had no effect on}} spider assemblages. 5.

40|$|Recent European {{policies}} on the ban of fishing discards and {{the closure of}} open-air landfills are expected to reduce predictable and abundant food resources for generalist seabirds. In order to forecast {{the consequences of this}} reduction on seabird breeding investment {{it is important to understand}} whether diverse anthropogenic foraging resources act synergistically or not and whether their influence is mediated by density-dependent mechanisms. To assess these effects at large spatio-temporal scale, we measured mean egg volume as a proxy of breeding investment in ca. 5, 000 three-egg clutches of the Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis) from 20 colonies of the Western Mediterranean, located both along European and African coasts. In European gull colonies, egg volume increased with the availability of fishing discards and landfills in the vicinity of the colony. However, the landfill effect was weaker than the effect of fishing discards, probably due to the lower quality of waste as food for gulls. In contrast, none of the anthropogenic food subsidies influenced egg volume in African colonies, likely due to socio-economic differences (i. e. a much lower availability and predictability of both discards and waste food. Finally, results showed that the positive association between fishing discards and open-air landfills on egg volume was mediated by negative density-dependent mechanisms probably related to an increase in competition for food.

40|$|AbstractThe {{selective}} {{properties of}} a bottom trawl {{fitted with a}} 70 mm diamond mesh codend and a 100 mm top square mesh panel (SMP) for hake (Merluccius merluccius), pouting (Trisopterus luscus and Trisopterus minutus) and red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) were investigated over the period 2011 – 2013. The experiments were carried out over three separate cruises aboard two commercial Basque bottom otter trawlers in the Bay of Biscay area. “Fall-through” experiments were also undertaken to estimate the potential size selection of 100 mm square mesh for the same species. Results from the “Fall-through” experiments and the at-sea selectivity cruises demonstrated that a 100 mm SMP {{has the potential to}} enable undersized and immature individuals to escape through the meshes. However, the selectivity cruises demonstrated that in practice, the SMP was largely ineffective at releasing undersized individuals as {{only a small fraction of}} the fish entering the trawl attempted to escape through the SMP during their drift towards the codend. The fraction attempting to escape was quantified by the “SMP contact probability” and was less than 4 % for hake and red mullet and less than 15 % for pouting. Furthermore, for each species, the release potential for the diamond mesh codend was found to be significantly lower than the length-at-maturity and the legal minimum conservation reference size. On average, the proportions of the total catch of undersized individuals of each species retained by the gear, were 52 %, 17 % and 45 % for hake, pouting and red mullet respectively. Based on our findings, we conclude that the gear currently deployed by the Basque bottom otter trawl fleet operating in the Bay of Biscay is largely ineffective at releasing undersized hake, pouting and red mullet. The introduction of the obligation to land all catches, under the 2013 reform of the EU Common Fisheries policy will create new challenges for the Basque bottom otter trawl fleet and thereby an incentive to improve selectivity to avoid <b>unwanted</b> <b>catches</b> of undersized individuals...|$|R
