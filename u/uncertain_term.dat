The non-linearity of this class of systems has to satisfy the Lipschitz condition whilst the <b>uncertain</b> <b>term</b> is a bounded function. Various performance indices are analysed to test {{the stability of the}} error system when all the non-linear terms satisfy the Lipschitz condition. A discontinuous observer for the system {{in the presence of a}} time-dependent uncertainty, based upon the sliding mode techniques, is designed to yield a feedforward compensation input to stabilise the error estimation system. The delays are not constant but they are bounded with bounded derivatives. A sufficient condition is required to ensure the stability of a non-linear observer for systems with uncertainties...|$|E

Simultaneous output-feedback linear quadratic controllers are designed for PV generators. This designed control scheme is robust with respect to intermittency and enhances the integration level in a sub-transmission and distributed system. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified on a 43 -bus industrial meshed distribution system under large disturbances.
