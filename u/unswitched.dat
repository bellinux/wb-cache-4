40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} model for {{explaining}} factors that influence consumer intentions to switch back (<b>unswitch)</b> in the mobile telecommunication industry context. The proposed structural model was tested using data from a cross-section of 756 subscribers of six global mobile telecommunication companies. The findings indicate that consumer intention to switch back is influenced by switching motive, post-switching behaviour and attractiveness of firm’s offer. Moreover, switching efficacy was found to moderate the effect of perceived attractiveness of firm’s offer on intention to switch back. The theoretical and managerial implications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} Index-Set Splitting (ISS), {{a technique}} that splits a loop containing several conditional statements into several loops with less complex control flow. Contrary to the classic loop <b>unswitching</b> technique, ISS splits loops when the conditional is loop variant. ISS uses an Index Sub-range Tree (IST) to identify {{the structure of the}} conditionals in the loop and to select which conditionals should be eliminated. This decision is based on an estimation of the code growth for each splitting: a greedy algorithm spends a pre-determined code growth budget. ISTs separate the decision about which splits to perform from the actual code generation for the split loops. The use of ISS to improve a loop fusion framework is then discussed. ISS opportunity identification in the SPEC 2000 benchmark suite and three other suites demonstrate that ISS is a general technique that may benefit other compilers. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{worst-case}} {{execution time}} (WCET) being the upper bound {{of the maximum}} execution time corresponds to the longest path through the program’s control flow graph. Its reduction is the objective of a WCET optimization. Unlike average-case execution time compiler optimizations which consider a static (most frequently executed) path, the longest path is variable since its optimization might result in another path becoming the effective longest path. To keep path information valid, WCET optimizations typically perform a time-consuming static WCET analysis after each code modification to ensure that subsequent optimization steps operate on the critical path. However, a code modification does not always lead to a path switch, making many WCET analyses superfluous. To cope with this problem, we propose a new paradigm called Invariant Path which eliminates the pessimism by indicating whether a path update is mandatory. To demonstrate the paradigm’s practical use, we developed a novel optimization called WCET-driven Loop <b>Unswitching</b> which exploits the Invariant Path information. In a case study, our optimization reduced the WCET of real-world benchmarks by up to 18. 3 %, while exploiting the Invariant Path paradigm led to a reduction of the optimization time by 57. 5 % on average. 1...|$|R
50|$|Also {{available}} in smaller conductor sizes are versions containing three current-carrying conductors and a circuit protective (earth) conductor. These configurations {{are commonly used}} for applications such as switched light circuits, battery-backed emergency lighting which requires a switched and <b>unswitched</b> supply, extractor fans with a run-on timer which require a switched and <b>unswitched</b> supply, mains-powered interlinked smoke alarms, and central heating thermostats.|$|E
50|$|Network SniffingSwitched and <b>unswitched</b> {{networks}} {{exist in}} networking. A switched network uses devices called switches that analyze {{and tell the}} packets travelling on the network where their endpoint is. An <b>unswitched</b> network is a free flow of packets without them being stopped and analyzed. Sniffing refers to using a program {{that allows you to}} see packets on the network and where they are going.|$|E

40|$|Translation {{validation}} is {{a technique}} for checking that, after an optimization has run, the input and output of the optimization are equivalent. Traditionally, translation validation {{has been used to}} prove concrete, fully specified programs equivalent. In this paper we present Parameterized Equivalence Checking (PEC), a generalization of translation validation that can prove the equivalence of parameterized programs. A parameterized program is a partially specified program that can represent multiple concrete programs. For example, a parameterized program may contain a section of code whose only known property {{is that it does not}} modify certain variables. By proving parameterized programs equivalent, PEC can prove the correctness of transformation rules that represent complex optimizations once and for all, before they are ever run. We implemented our PEC technique in a tool that can establish the equivalence of two parameterized programs. To highlight the power of PEC, we designed a language for implementing complex optimizations using many-to-many rewrite rules, and used this language to implement a variety of optimizations including software pipelining, loop unrolling, loop <b>unswitching,</b> loop interchange, and loop fusion. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of PEC, we used our PEC implementation to verify that all the optimizations we implemented in our language preserve program behavior...|$|R
