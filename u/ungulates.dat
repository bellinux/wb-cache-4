5|$|Bats are placental mammals. They were {{formerly}} grouped in the superorder Archonta, {{along with}} the treeshrews (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and the primates, because of the apparent similarities between Megachiroptera and such mammals. Genetic evidence places bats in the superorder Laurasiatheria, with its sister taxon as Fereuungulata, which includes carnivorans, pangolins, odd-toed <b>ungulates,</b> even-toed <b>ungulates,</b> and cetaceans. One study places Chiroptera as a sister taxon to odd-toed <b>ungulates</b> (Perissodactyla).|$|E
5|$|The family Bovidae {{is placed}} in the order Artiodactyla (which {{includes}} the even-toed <b>ungulates).</b> It includes 143 extant species, accounting for nearly 55% of the <b>ungulates,</b> and 300 known extinct species.|$|E
5|$|The even-toed <b>ungulates</b> are <b>ungulates</b> whose {{weight is}} borne about equally {{by the third}} and fourth toes, rather than mostly or entirely by the third as in perissodactyls. There are about 220 {{artiodactyl}} species worldwide, including many that are of great economic importance.|$|E
50|$|Tetraparvovirus are a genus {{of viruses}} {{in the family}} Parvoviridae. There are {{currently}} six recognized species: Chiropteran tetraparvovirus 1, Primate tetraparvovirus 1, <b>Ungulate</b> tetraparvovirus 1, <b>Ungulate</b> tetraparvovirus 2, <b>Ungulate</b> tetraparvovirus 3, and <b>Ungulate</b> tetraparvovirus 4.|$|R
40|$|Precipitation, primary productivity, and {{herbivore}} biomass {{are linked}} to <b>ungulate</b> richness (the number of species) in African ecosystems. This study compares the richness of late-middle to late Pleistocene and Holocene <b>ungulate</b> assemblages in southern Africa 2 ̆ 7 s Cape Floral Region (CFR). Regression analysis demonstrates that Pleistocene <b>ungulate</b> assemblages are significantly richer than their Holocene counterparts. Elevated Pleistocene <b>ungulate</b> richness is not explained by differential time-averaging, the presence of extinct taxa in Pleistocene assemblages, or by Middle Stone Age (MSA) to Later Stone Age (LSA) technological change, but instead by {{a greater number of}} grazing species in Pleistocene faunal communities. Based on modern African analogs, this implies that the Pleistocene assemblages examined here sample time intervals characterized by elevated primary productivity, particularly of grassland habitats, greater <b>ungulate</b> biomass, and altered rainfall regimes. Declining <b>ungulate</b> richness from the Pleistocene to the Holocene supports the hypothesis that the extinction of specialized grazers at the Pleistocene–Holocene transition in the CFR was driven by declining productivity and availability of grassland habitats. The contrast between rich Pleistocene <b>ungulate</b> communities and impoverished Holocene <b>ungulate</b> communities may also explain important differences in MSA and LSA subsistence behavior. It is proposed that intensified exploitation of fish, shellfish, tortoises, and seabirds by LSA foragers during the Holocene reflects an expansion of diet breadth in response to diminished <b>ungulate</b> biomass on the landscape rather than fundamental behavioral/cognitive advances...|$|R

5|$|Horses are {{odd-toed}} <b>ungulates,</b> {{or members}} of the order Perissodactyla. This order also includes the extant species of rhinos and tapirs, and many extinct families and species. Members of this order walk on either one toe (like horses) or three toes (like rhinos and tapirs). This {{is in contrast to}} even-toed <b>ungulates,</b> members of the order Artiodactyla, which walk on cloven hooves, or two toes. This order includes many species associated with livestock, such as sheep, goats, pigs, cows and camels, as well as species of giraffes, antelopes and deer.|$|E

5|$|A 27,500-year old {{burial of}} an 18-month old child, {{complete}} with burial gift decorative artifacts, pendant or necklace elements made of teeth of large <b>ungulates,</b> {{was discovered in}} Borsuk Cave near Kraków (southern Kraków-Częstochowa Upland). It {{is believed to be}} the oldest intentional burial located in Poland.|$|E
25|$|Intentional dog burials {{together}} with <b>ungulate</b> hunting {{is also found}} in other early Holocene deciduous forest forager societies in Europe and North America, indicating that across the Holarctic temperate zone hunting dogs were a widespread adaptation to forest <b>ungulate</b> hunting.|$|R

5|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are members}} of the infraorder Cetacea, which are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the order Artiodactyla (even-toed <b>ungulates).</b> They are related to the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} indicates that mammals did not explosively diversify across the K–Pg boundary, despite the environment niches made available by the extinction of dinosaurs. Several mammalian orders have been interpreted as diversifying immediately after the K–Pg boundary, including Chiroptera (bats) and Cetartiodactyla (a diverse group that today includes whales and dolphins and even-toed <b>ungulates),</b> although recent research concludes that only marsupial orders diversified after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E

5|$|In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times, the Egyptian climate {{was much}} less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing <b>ungulates.</b> Foliage and fauna were far more {{prolific}} in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and {{this is also the}} period when many animals were first domesticated.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 was {{described}} in 2004 by Francisco Goin and colleagues, who tentatively interpreted the tooth as a left last upper molar. Although they saw similarities with South American <b>ungulates,</b> some early rodents, and multituberculates, they believed the tooth was most likely of a gondwanathere. Among gondwanatheres—a small and poorly known group otherwise known from the Cretaceous through Eocene {{of some of the}} southern continents (Gondwana)—they thought the Cretaceous Argentinian Ferugliotherium to be the most similar.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} is {{the type}} genus of the family Hippopotamidae. The pygmy hippopotamus belongs to a different genus in Hippopotamidae, either Choeropsis or Hexaprotodon. Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. Sometimes, the subfamily Hippopotaminae is used. Further, some taxonomists group hippopotamuses and anthracotheres in the superfamily Anthracotheroidea. Hippopotamidae are classified along with other even-toed <b>ungulates</b> in the order Artiodactyla. Other artiodactyls include camels, cattle, deer and pigs, although hippopotamuses are not closely related to these groups.|$|E

5|$|The horse {{adapted to}} survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, {{surviving}} in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not. Horses and other equids are odd-toed <b>ungulates</b> of the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals that was dominant during the Tertiary period. In the past, this order contained 14families, but only three—Equidae (the horse and related species), Tapiridae (the tapir), and Rhinocerotidae (the rhinoceroses)—have survived to the present day.|$|E
5|$|The sinew, {{soaked in}} animal glue, is then laid in layers {{on the back}} of the bow; the strands of sinew are {{oriented}} along the length of the bow. The sinew is normally obtained from the lower legs and back of wild deer or domestic <b>ungulates.</b> Traditionally, ox tendons are considered inferior to wild-game sinews since they have a higher fat content, leading to spoilage. Sinew will extend farther than wood, again allowing more energy storage.|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest {{can also}} {{listen in on}} the alarm calls of other species, and by doing so can reduce their risk of predation. One study showed, along with other <b>ungulates,</b> wildebeests responded more {{strongly}} to the baboon alarm calls compared to the baboon contest calls, though both types of calls had similar patterns, amplitudes, and durations. The alarm calls were a response of the baboons to lions, and the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred.|$|E

50|$|The {{reserve is}} home to three wild <b>ungulate</b> species. The most {{prominent}} is the Marco Polo sheep. In the 1980s there were about 150 of these large wild sheep in the reserve. Today, the population has increased to about 1,000 animals. The other two <b>ungulate</b> species are the Siberian ibex and the blue sheep. Another <b>ungulate,</b> which was present originally in the area is the kiang. Large predators are represented by snow leopard, wolf and brown bear. About 7,750 people with 70,000 domestic animals inhabit the reserve. The livestock has a strong impact on the reserves vegetation.|$|R
5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it is possible that they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is possible that the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic <b>ungulates</b> ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales (systematic name Mysticeti), known earlier as {{whalebone}} whales, form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises). They are {{a widely}} distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically {{thought to have}} descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed <b>ungulates</b> (Artiodactyla). Baleen whales split from toothed whales (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to media}} reports and {{speculation}} at the time, the fires killed very few park animals— surveys indicated {{that only about}} 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000–50,000), 36 mule deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Of 21 grizzlies that were radio-collared and had home ranges where the fires happened, only one was {{believed to have been}} lost. Grizzlies were observed in burned areas more often than unburned areas the following year, feeding on the proliferation of roots and foliage as well as on ants which thrived due to all the dead wood. Moose had been declining in the northern sections of the park since the 1960s, but the decline became more obvious after the fires. Unlike elk, which are primarily grazers and tend to eat grasses, moose {{are more likely to be}} browsers, consuming primarily woody food sources, particularly willow and subalpine fir, which were temporarily reduced by the fires. All <b>ungulates</b> experienced a high initial mortality the winter after the fires, but this has been attributed to a severe winter more than the fires themselves. However, moose populations, unlike other <b>ungulates,</b> have not rebounded in subsequent years. Rodents likely experienced the highest mortality of all mammals due not only to heat and smoke they could not easily escape, but also because of the reduction in forest cover, allowing would-be predators less difficulty in spotting them.|$|E
