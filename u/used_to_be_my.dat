500|$|... "This <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>My</b> Playground" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Madonna. It is the theme for the film A League of Their Own, which starred Madonna, and portrayed a fictionalized account of the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Madonna was asked to record a song for the film's soundtrack. At that time she was busy recording her fifth studio album, Erotica, [...] with producer Shep Pettibone. They worked on some ideas {{and came up with}} [...] "This <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>My</b> Playground" [...] in two days. Once presented to director Penny Marshall's team, the song was released as a standalone single on June 16, 1992, by Warner Bros. Records. However, it was not available on the film's soundtrack due to contractual obligations and was later added to the Olympics-inspired Barcelona Gold compilation album, released that summer. The song was included on Madonna's 1995 ballads compilation Something to Remember.|$|E
500|$|... "This <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>My</b> Playground" [...] {{features}} a keyboard introduction, {{followed by the}} strings and the song starts. Musically, the song {{is set in the}} time signature of common time with a slow tempo of 77 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G minor with Madonna vocals ranging from the chords of G3 to B4. The song follows a basic sequence of Gm–F/G–Emaj7–Dm7–Gsus–G as its chord progression. The chords have an unexpected flow in terms of the beginning and the ending, moving from E down to Gm and momentarily to F major, then going back to the previous sequence again. The song has a lush, romantic quality, with the melody going through different ranges and peaks, and the verse and the chorus flow into each other, making it sound seamless. Madonna sings in subdued but expressive vocals, aided by the strings and background singers during the third verse. Towards the end the singer's voice is double tracked and produces little amount of roughness. Lyrically the song talks about Madonna revisiting the places from her childhood ("This <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> playground / This <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> childhood dream"), and evokes the songwriting on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer (1989). The singer is in a dilemma between choosing the past and letting go, concluding that the latter is difficult ("Say goodbye to yesterday (the dream) / Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say))". The track has a sudden ending with the orchestra and the backing vocal uttering [...] "Wishing you were here with me", the line addressed to Madonna's mother.|$|E

[...] She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence.

40|$|In this issue, Warner Schaie {{summarizes}} his {{longitudinal study}} of adult cognitive development. His earlier publications from this study pioneered the general developmental model — {{with its emphasis on}} disentangling the influences of age, cohort, and period on human development. This article now takes the psychological study of adult development a provocative new step forward. Schaie proposes application of Event History Analysis, a predominantly sociological technique, to psychological phenomena by using the individual's age at which significant decline occurs as the event. If indeed he can successfully use some set of variables to predict the age at which a given individual <b>is</b> most likely <b>to</b> experience major cognitive changes, the implications of this power, as Schaie himself recognizes, are worth contemplating. Clinically, it is apparent that individuals are often aware of their own mental changes and lapses. Mild and infrequent instances of forgetfulness or becoming distracted are recounted somewhat ruefully with self-deprecating humor. "I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> concerned about <b>my</b> memory until I forgot to worry anymore, " someone might joke. Thus, people know that they are changing and they make adjustments to compensate. The eminent cognitive psychologist Hebb (1978) described himself at age 74 : "I realize that I hav...|$|R

Spears stated, [...] "The video is more sensual than I'm <b>used</b> <b>to</b> [...] It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> first time doing a collaboration and I got Madonna.

The vehicle used in the video, a Mazda RX-8, was autographed by Spears on the hood and auctioned off to benefit the Britney Spears Foundation. In 2009, Hunter talked to MTV News about the video, saying, [...] "Madonna is an icon of an earlier generation, and then Britney of the newer generation. She was at her peak at that point [...] So it <b>was</b> a challenge <b>to</b> kind of bring both of the worlds together.

I wanted to make great achievements, so I {{had no choice but}} to submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men.

Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly.

In the beginning, I was writing only about my hometown, because it was easier for me to write about it than about people, especially my family. Even though I knew that what I was thinking almost every day <b>was</b> <b>my</b> family, I didn’t want people to know about my true feelings and the painful experiences I had had. I wanted to make the story sound beautiful, and tried not to write about personal feelings, but gradually I realized that this was not the way I wanted to write. Even though I still hesitated to write about my personal feelings, I decided to face up to my true feelings at the bottom of my heart. I also wanted to look back on life of almost 23 years, and to organize my feelings about my family and hometown before I leave home to go to Tokyo for my job next April. I {{thought it would be a}} good opportunity to see what I was really thinking. When I was writing this story, I sometimes became very emotional and I often felt that I couldn’t write anymore, because some of the parts were painful for me to write or even to remember, and it took a lot of courage to write.

They did not have any strings written originally for the song, and chose composer Jeremy Lubbock for the music arrangement; Lubbock had previously worked with Madonna on her soundtrack album I'm Breathless (1990). Madonna recorded the song on a Shure SM57 microphone, with the melody being played over and over again, accompanied by the piano, organ, strings and a basic rim-looping sound on a portable Macintosh computer. Pettibone spent the rest of the recording session working on the verses and final structure of [...] "This <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>My</b> Playground" [...] was completed.
