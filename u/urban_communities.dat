5|$|The Dravidar Kazhagam {{came to be}} {{well known}} among the <b>urban</b> <b>communities</b> and students. Villages were {{influenced}} by its message. Hindi, and ceremonies that had become associated with Brahmanical priesthood, were identified as alien symbols that should be eliminated from Tamil culture. Brahmins, who were regarded as the guardians of such symbols, came under verbal attack. From 1949 onwards, the Dravidar Kazhagam intensified social reformist work and put forward the fact that superstitions were the cause for the degeneration of Dravidians. The Dravidar Kazhagam vehemently fought for the abolition of untouchability amongst the Dalits. It also focused its attention on the liberation of women, women's education, willing marriage, widow marriage, orphanages and mercy homes.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, more {{chickens}} {{are kept}} {{than any other}} type of poultry, with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs. Traditionally, such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night. This is still the case in developing countries, where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry. However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units. These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for <b>urban</b> <b>communities.</b> Profitability of production depends very much on the price of feed, which has been rising. High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production.|$|E

5|$|Inability {{to secure}} the airway, with {{subsequent}} failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life-threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased oxygen content, brain damage, cardiovascular collapse, and death. When performed improperly, the associated complications (e.g., unrecognized esophageal intubation) may be rapidly fatal. Without adequate training and experience, the incidence of such complications is high. The case of Andrew Davis Hughes, from Emerald Isle, NC is a widely known {{case in which the}} patient was improperly intubated and, {{due to the lack of}} oxygen, suffered severe brain damage and died. For example, among paramedics in several United States <b>urban</b> <b>communities,</b> unrecognized esophageal or hypopharyngeal intubation has been reported to be 6% to 25%. Although not common, where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate, reported success rates are as low as 51%. In one study, nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in the emergency room. Because of this, recent editions of the American Heart Association's Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation have de-emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, the laryngeal mask airway and the Combitube.|$|E
5|$|Downtown San Diego {{is located}} on San Diego Bay.

The communities north of the valley and freeway, and south of Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, include Clairemont, Kearny Mesa, Tierrasanta, and Navajo. Stretching north from Miramar are the northern suburbs of Mira Mesa, Scripps Ranch, Rancho Peñasquitos, and Rancho Bernardo. The far northeast portion of the city encompasses Lake Hodges and the San Pasqual Valley, which holds an agricultural preserve. Carmel Valley and Del Mar Heights occupy {{the northwest corner of}} the city. To their south are Torrey Pines State Reserve and the business center of the Golden Triangle. Further south are the beach and coastal communities of La Jolla, Pacific Beach, Mission Beach, and Ocean Beach. Point Loma occupies the peninsula across San Diego Bay from downtown. The communities of South San Diego, such as San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, are located next to the Mexico–United States border, and are physically separated {{from the rest of the}} city by the cities of National City and Chula Vista. A narrow strip of land at the bottom of San Diego Bay connects these southern neighborhoods with the rest of the city.|$|E
5|$|Johnson began {{thinking}} of life after basketball while still {{playing with the}} Lakers. He wondered why so many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he {{had a meeting with}} Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into business, a high-end sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him to listen to his customers and find out what products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in <b>urban</b> <b>communities,</b> creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through his movie theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. Johnson has also invested in urban California real estate and financial service companies catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2006-07, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, then the tallest building in Brooklyn, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.|$|E

40|$|The study aimed on {{addressing}} {{urban poverty}} {{in context with}} <b>urban</b> <b>community</b> gardens {{in the case of}} Karoi Town Council. The problem statement states that, due to the prevailing situation in Zimbabwe of poor economy and limited employment opportunities, urban residents are now living under poverty conditions, earning below the poverty datum line and enduring with one meal a day. So it is the core of the study to show how <b>urban</b> <b>community</b> gardens can solve such challenges and reduces urban poverty. The research objectives are; {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>urban</b> <b>community</b> gardens in reducing urban poverty, to assess the extent to which <b>urban</b> <b>community</b> gardens meet the demands of household food security, to find out challenges faced by <b>urban</b> <b>community</b> gardens beneficiaries and to identify strategies that can be used to improve the conditions of <b>urban</b> <b>community</b> gardens in Karoi town. The literature review covered several aspects upon <b>community</b> gardens and <b>urban</b> poverty. It highlighted the role of literature review to the study, which is to summarises, evaluates and clarifying the works of the study being carried out. It has also defined <b>urban</b> poverty, <b>urban</b> <b>community</b> gardens and <b>urban</b> agriculture. More so, the literature review explained the nature of poverty in the world and in the Zimbabwean context. The role of Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals to poverty and Agriculture were also explained. Theoretical framework was explained basing on two theories which are Johanne Henry Von Thunenâ€™s Spatial Land Theory and Cultural and Structural Poverty Theory, which explained urban farming and poverty respectively. For empirical evidence, two case studies were used which are; the case of Masizame community garden in South Africa and Gamakalle garden in Niger. Quantitative and qualitative research design was used. The target population for the study are the beneficiaries of <b>urban</b> <b>community</b> gardens of Karoi and Karoi Town Council employees. The actual population of Karoi is 28 606. The sampling technique were grouped into two, probability and non-probability sampling. For this study, purposive or judgemental sampling was used as non-probability sampling and simple random sampling as probability sampling. The sample size, are 40 community garden beneficiaries and 10 Karoi Town Council employees, which makes the total of 50 sample size. Focus group discussions, interviews and questionnaires are the research instruments used to gather data for the study. The research has found that <b>urban</b> <b>community</b> gardens are playing a pivotal role in addressing urban poverty through, income generation, increasing meals per day after harvesting, nutritional diversity, socio-economic empowerment and employment creation. The research concludes that, <b>urban</b> <b>community</b> gardens are effective in addressing urban poverty, because residents are benefiting from the gardens and their standards of life are being rising. However, although community gardens are effective, the study recommend, the legalising of <b>urban</b> <b>community</b> gardens, inclusion of <b>urban</b> <b>community</b> gardens in planning, improve <b>urban</b> <b>community</b> garden technology, increase extension services coverage and improve market linkages for <b>urban</b> <b>community</b> gardens produce...|$|R
