Ere that come to pass; ere the Pequod's weedy hull rolls {{side by side with}} the barnacled hulls of the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow.|$|E
60|$|Whenever the <b>unshored</b> pit {{caves in}} the {{accident}} has been caused by evil-minded ghosts, the kobolds of Germany, in which Cornwall till lately believed. Fetish then steps forward and forbids further search. Thus many of the richest placers have been closed. Such, for instance, is the Monte do Diabo (Devil's Hill), the native Mankwadi, [Footnote: Again, I cannot connect Mankwadi (or even Manquada) with 'Maquida or Azeb, Queen of Sheba'--the latter country probably lying in South Arabian Yemen.] near Winnebah, fifteen leagues east from Elmina. The miners {{were killed by the}} heat of the shafts, and the mine was at once placed 'in fetish.' But 'fetish' has now lost much of its authority; the Satanic hill will soon be exploited, and its only difficulty is its disputed ownership by 'Ghartey, King of Winnebah,' and 'Okill Ensah, King of Ejemakun.' These dignitaries condescend to advertise against each other in the local papers.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the behavior of}} wood-concrete composite beams in which the wood layer is composed of recycled utility poles. Two full-scale laboratory specimens of 7; 500 -mm (295 -in.) span were constructed, with the concrete slab cast on the timber poles left <b>unshored.</b> The connection was obtained by cutting six notches in the timber poles. A threaded steel dowel is placed in each notch extending through both layers with a nut {{on the bottom of}} the beam that can be tightened once the concrete has cured. Since the material in each layer exhibits a time-dependent response, it is necessary to examine the effects of sustained loading. After 28 days of initial curing of the concrete layer during which the midspan deflection was monitored, both beams were subjected to the service load to estimate the composite efficiency. The beams were very stiff and values of 96...|$|E
40|$|Investigates the {{long-term}} behaviour of wood-concrete composite floor/deck systems with shear key/anchor connection detail. The beam specimens were first monitored in {{time after the}} concrete placement on the wood deck, and then subjected to a sustained load. The experimental results have also been extended to the entire service life of the structure using a Finite Element model. The primary observations are: (i) the bleeding of the fresh concrete {{is not an issue}} for the durability of the wood deck; (ii) the type of construction (shored, <b>unshored)</b> is of little influence for the structural performance; (iii) the deflection increases quite significantly over the time because of the rheological phenomena of the component materials. The use of concrete with reduced shrinkage and the pre-cambering of the wood deck are two possible ways to reduce {{the long-term}} deflection. The experimental and numerical results are finally compared with those obtained using a simplified approach, showing that the simplified approach leads to reasonably good accuracy...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{a project}} at the University of Minnesota to {{investigate}} the application of high-strength concrete in prestressed girders, four shear tests were performed on high-strength concrete prestressed girders. Originally constructed in August 1993, the girders, Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) 45 M sections were 45 inches deep. Each girder utilized 46 0. 6 -inch diameter prestressing strands on 2 -inch centers. The girders were designed assuming a 28 -day compressive strength of 10, 500 psi. Later, a 4 -foot-wide and 9 -inch-thick composite concrete deck was added to each girder using <b>unshored</b> construction techniques. The shear test results were compared with predicted results from ACI 318 - 95 Simplified Method, ACI 318 - 95 Detailed Method (AASHTO 1989), Modified ACI 318 - 95 Procedure, Modified Compression Field Theory (AASHTO LRFD 1994), Modified Truss Theory, Truss Theory, Horizontal Shear Design (AASHTO 1989), and Shear Friction (AASHTO LRFD 1994). The calculated shear capacities were in all cases conservative compared to the actual shear capacity. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|E
40|$|Archaeology shares {{some common}} safety {{concerns}} with other trenching operations such as grave digging and pipe laying. Foremost amongst {{these are the}} dangers of work-ing in <b>unshored</b> or inadequately shored excavations. It is not uncommon far archaeological excavations {{to be more than}} 1. 5 m deep and deep shafts 4 - 6 m deep have occa-sionally been dug (e. g. at Devils Lair, Koonalda Cave, Malakunanja 11 and Mushroom Rock). Shoring has been used in some cases. For instance, Jones used it in his excavations at Rocky Cape in 1 % 5 - 67 (R. Jones pers. comm.), at Nauwalabila 1 in 1981 (Jones and Johnson 1985) and most recently at Allens Cave (R. Jones and S. Cane p m. comm.). Dortch installed an internal scaf-folding of pipe-work and heavy duty timber shoring in the deep trench at Devils Lair (Dortch 1984). Sim used a series of nested prefabricated boxes in her excavations on King Island (Sim and Thorne 1990) and Horton and Wright used timber soldier sets in trenches at Trinkey (Wright pers. comm.). These however are the exceptions and it is still all too rare for shoring to be used on prehis-toric sites. The usual practice is to install some form of shoring only when deposits are demonstrably loose and unconsolidated or where slumping or fretting of the sec-tions is actively taking p k e. In cases where shoring has been used there is also some question as to whether it has been adequately engineered for the lateral stresses that would be imposed should the trench fail catastrophically. Many of us are reluctant to shore because it is seen as time-consuming, expensive and it interferes with access to the faces of an excavation. This is exacerbated by the fact that most Australian-trained field archaeologists lack dir-ect experience in the proper installation of shoring and that the industrial shoring equipment available for hire (e. g. acrow props, drag boxes, steel sheet pilings and trench linings) is clearly not suitable for most archaeologi-cal applications. However, excavating in deep <b>unshored</b> trenches is a form of 'Russian roulette ' in which we stake our lives on a rather casual assessment that the trench walls will continue to be self-supporting. Sooner or later a trench wall will fail and without the safety margin p m vided by shoring, someone will be killed (cf. Haywar...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} the {{research}} {{is to develop a}} computer based procedure for calculation of stresses and deformations of partially prestressed continuous beams and frames. The analysis accounts for the nonlinearity produced by cracking, creep and shrinkage of concrete, as well as relaxation of prestressed steel. Composite members made of precast prestressed girders and cast-in-place topping and joints are within the scope of the proposed method. Second stage post-tensioning can be introduced to the members to make them a continuous beam or frame. ^ The procedure accounts for cracking under the weight of cast-in-place topping, any superimposed loads and the time-dependent stress redistribution. Thus, creep, shrinkage and relaxation are taken into account for cracked prestressed concrete members. Attempt is made to limit the input data to information commonly available to designers. Both shored and <b>unshored</b> construction are allowed for. Linear creep law is used, and the time-dependent effects, such as prestress losses and deflection growth, are automatically generated. ^ The step-by-step method is employed to evaluate the variations of stresses and deformations with time. The time period is divided into discrete time intervals depending upon time at which various loads are applied. The increments of stresses and deformations during each interval are calculated with consideration of the time-dependent effects occurring in preceding intervals. Updating values are determined by summing up their increments up to the interval considered. ^ A rational procedure is presented for analysis of the cracked composite section. It accounts for possible subsequent cracking as well as initial cracking. Therefore, the procedure is continued to check for additional cracking due to successive loading applications and time-development of stresses. ^ A computer program is developed for analysis of partially prestressed composite members. It is especially useful for analysis of continuous beams or frames with multi-stage construction and prestressing, including use of temporary falsework among its diverse applications. The output data give instantaneous as well as gradually developing stresses in concrete and steel at every sections considered. The program also provides variation of displacement with time along the centroidal axis of the structure. ...|$|E
