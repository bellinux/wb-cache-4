5000|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} {{is the concept of}} [...] "fast ignition," [...] which may offer a way to directly heat the high density fuel after compression, thus decoupling the heating and compression phases of the implosion. In this approach the target is first compressed [...] "normally" [...] using a driver laser system, and then when the implosion reaches maximum density (at the stagnation point or [...] "bang time"), a second ultra-short pulse <b>ultra-high</b> <b>power</b> petawatt (PW) laser delivers a single pulse focused {{on one side of the}} core, dramatically heating it and hopefully starting fusion ignition. The two types of fast ignition are the [...] "plasma bore-through" [...] method and the [...] "cone-in-shell" [...] method. In the first method the petawatt laser is simply expected to bore straight through the outer plasma of an imploding capsule and to impinge on and heat the dense core, whereas in the cone-in-shell method, the capsule is mounted on the end of a small high-z (high atomic number) cone such that the tip of the cone projects into the core of the capsule. In this second method, when the capsule is imploded, the petawatt has a clear view straight to the high density core and does not have to waste energy boring through a 'corona' plasma; however, the presence of the cone affects the implosion process in significant ways that are not fully understood. Several projects are currently underway to explore the fast ignition approach, including upgrades to the OMEGA laser at the University of Rochester, the GEKKO XII device in Japan, and an entirely new £500 million facility, known as HiPER, proposed for construction in the European Union. If successful, the fast ignition approach could dramatically lower the total amount of energy needed to be delivered to the target; whereas NIF uses UV beams of 2 MJ, HiPER's driver is 200 kJ and heater 70 kJ, yet the predicted fusion gains are nevertheless even higher than on NIF.|$|E

We experimentally demonstrate that the ST noise originates from the optical surface imperfections in the pulse stretcher/ compressor and exhibits a linear ST coupling in the far-field plane. The contrast on the far-field axis, underestimated in the conventional measurements, is further improved by avoiding the far-field optics in the stretcher.
