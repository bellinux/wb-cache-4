500|$|In East Asia, where {{polished}} {{white rice}} was the common staple food {{of the middle}} class, beriberi resulting from lack of vitamin B1 was endemic. In 1884, Takaki Kanehiro, a British trained medical doctor of the Imperial Japanese Navy, observed that beriberi was endemic among low-ranking crew who often ate nothing but rice, but not among officers who consumed a Western-style diet. With {{the support of the}} Japanese navy, he experimented using crews of two battleships; one crew was fed only white rice, while the other was fed a diet of meat, fish, barley, rice, and beans. The group that ate only white rice documented 161 crew members with beriberi and 25 deaths, while the latter group had only 14 cases of beriberi and no deaths. This convinced Takaki and the Japanese Navy that diet was the cause of beriberi, but they mistakenly believed that sufficient amounts of protein prevented it. That diseases could result from some dietary deficiencies was further investigated by Christiaan Eijkman, who in 1897 discovered that feeding <b>unpolished</b> <b>rice</b> instead of the polished variety to chickens helped to prevent beriberi in the chickens. The following year, Frederick Hopkins postulated that some foods contained [...] "accessory factors"— in addition to proteins, carbohydrates, fats etc.— that are necessary for the functions of the human body. Hopkins and Eijkman were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1929 for their discoveries.|$|E

40|$|A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the use}} of dehulled and <b>unpolished</b> whole <b>rice</b> in Japanese quails' diet. A total of 100 80 -days-old Japanese quails (149. 07 ± 10 g) were distributed in five treatments: 0 % dehulled and <b>unpolished</b> whole <b>rice</b> (control diet based on corn and soybean meal), 20, 40, 60, and 80 % of whole rice in replacement of corn; respectively, treatments 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Productive performance was evaluated through egg production (%), egg weight (g), body weight (g), egg mass (g), feed conversion per egg mass and feed conversion per dozen eggs. The following variables measured the internal quality of eggs: albumen height (mm), yolk color and percentage, egg white percentage and Haugh units. The external quality of eggs was measured through specific gravity (g cm- 3), shell thickness (µm) and shell percentage. Treatment means were analyzed through polynomial regression at 5 %. As the level of whole rice was increased in the diets, a significant linear increase in egg production (p = 0. 005), egg mass (p = 0. 007), shell thickness (p = 0. 03) and specific gravity (p = 0. 007) was observed. Feed conversion per egg mass (p = 0. 006), feed conversion per dozen eggs (p = 0. 003) and egg color (p < 0. 0001), on the other hand, were reduced linearly. The increased utilization of whole rice increased the cost of the diet. In conclusion, the addition of dehulled and <b>unpolished</b> whole <b>rice</b> in partial substitution of corn in Japanese quails' diets increases the egg production and reduces the yolk color...|$|R

40|$|Australian wild rices {{are genetically}} {{distinct}} from commercially cultivated rices and present {{new opportunities for}} the development of improved rice cultivars. Before use in rice breeding, the eating and cooking properties of Australian wild rice must first be understood as these are key factors in determining rice quality and consumer acceptance. Samples of Australian wild rice (taxa B) were collected and evaluated together with a commercial Canadian wild rice (Zizania aquatic L.), Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare, and selected commercial rices including long grain, medium grain, basmati, red basmati, and red rice. Cooking profiles were established, physical traits were measured and conventional descriptive analysis techniques were used to compare the sensory properties of the <b>unpolished</b> <b>rices.</b> Twenty six descriptors, together with definitions, were developed with a panel of twelve experienced assessors including aroma, flavour, texture and aftertaste attributes. Results reveal that the Australian wild rice had a mild aroma and flavour similar to that of red rice and red basmati but without the lingering aftertaste. In terms of texture, the wild rice was firmer, and somewhat crunchy and chewy rather than soft and fluffy despite requiring a longer cooking time. The sensory, physical and cooking profiles indicate that Australian wild rice has a high potential for commercialization in itself and provides a suitable genetic source for breeding programs, particularly in the coloured rice market...|$|R
5000|$|Eijkman {{had been}} sent to the Dutch East Indies to study Beriberi, a disease of the {{peripheral}} nerves, but his discovery of the cause was accidental. He noticed the symptoms of beriberi in some chickens used in his laboratory when their feed had been altered for a few months. During that time, chickens in the laboratory had been fed leftover rice from military rations, until a new cook refused to allow military rice to be fed to civilian animals. Rice was then purchased from another source, and the birds soon recovered. During the months that the chickens developed beriberi, the feed had been polished rice, and when the birds' diet was switched back to <b>unpolished</b> <b>rice,</b> the birds recovered in a few days. Eijkman surmised that polished rice lacked a dietary component found in <b>unpolished</b> <b>rice,</b> and that beriberi was caused by depriving the body of this component, which he called [...] "the anti-beriberi factor". Subsequently, Eijkman was able to prove that the disease was not caused by blood contamination, respiratory metabolism, perspiration, or seasonal or temperature variation. He suspected the disease was caused by an unknown bacteria.|$|E
5000|$|In 1897, Christiaan Eijkman, a Dutch {{physician}} and pathologist, demonstrated that beriberi {{is caused by}} poor diet, and discovered that feeding <b>unpolished</b> <b>rice</b> (instead of the polished variety) to chickens helped to prevent beriberi.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the distribution of zinc in dorsal and ventral grain sections of rice varieties with low (RD 21), moderate (CNT 1 and KDML 105), and high (KPK and NR) zinc concentrations. Samples of unhusked rice grain were partitioned longitudinally and analyzed for zinc. The concentration of zinc was higher in the dorsal grain section than the ventral section, but to a different extent in different varieties. In <b>unpolished</b> <b>rice,</b> the zinc concentration in the dorsal section exceeded that in the ventral section by 14 % in CNT 1 to 63 % in RD 21. The higher zinc concentration in the dorsal section of <b>unpolished</b> <b>rice</b> might be explained by storage in the multiple cell layered aleurone and thicker pericarp. The higher concentration of dorsal zinc, however, was maintained after polishing, irrespective of the removal of grain surface by polishing that varied with variety and polishing time from 11 to 207 μm in depth. Zinc concentration of polished rice, ranging from 14 to 28 mg of zinc/kg, was strongly predicted by the zinc in <b>unpolished</b> <b>rice</b> (P < 0. 01). This uneven distribution of zinc in the dorsal and ventral sections of rice grain suggests a specific pattern by which zinc is laid down.

40|$|Ten {{species of}} {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in rice were determined. Total PAH levels in unpol-ished rice ranged from 46 to 77 µg/kg dry weight, which an arithmetic mean value of 58 µg/kg dry weight. Phenan-threne was the most abundant in rice and rice straw. Individual PAH content in <b>unpolished</b> <b>rice</b> was higher than in polished rice. Total PAH contents in <b>unpolished</b> <b>rice</b> was 3 -fold in polished rice. PAH concentration ratios for the lighter molecular weights (152 – 202) to the heavier molecular weights (228 – 252) in rice and paddy leaf, approxi-mated to 70 : 30. Fluoranthene and pyrene commonly exist in environmental waters. River water and rainwater contained much greater levels of PAHs than groundwater.

50|$|Rice {{is often}} rinsed and soaked before cooked. <b>Unpolished</b> brown <b>rice</b> {{requires}} longer soaking time than the milled white rice does. The {{amount of water}} added can vary depending on many factors. Newly harvested rice usually requires less water, and softer varieties need more water than firmer varieties. Rice can be boiled in a heavy-bottomed cookware or steamed in a food steamer. Some boiling methods do not require precise water measurements, as the rice is strained after boiling. This draining method is suitable for the less glutinous varieties such as basmati rice, but not-suitable for varieties like japonica rice which become sticky to some degree when cooked. Optionally, small amount of salt can be added before cooking. If not drained, boiled rice is usually cooked on high heat until a rolling boil, then simmered with the lid on, and steamed over the residual heat after turning off the heat. Nowadays, electric rice cookers are also commonly used to cook rice. During cooking, rice absorbs water and increase in volume and mass.|$|R
40|$|Synchrotron-based X-ray {{fluorescence}} (S-XRF) {{was utilized}} to locate arsenic (As) in polished (white) and <b>unpolished</b> (brown) <b>rice</b> grains from the United States, China, and Bangladesh.

In brown rice As {{was found to be}} preferentially localized at the surface, in the region corresponding to the pericarp and aleurone layer. Copper, iron, manganese, and zinc localization followed that of arsenic in brown rice, while the location for cadmium and nickel was distinctly different, showing relatively even distribution throughout the endosperm. The localization of As in the outer grain of brown rice was confirmed by laser ablation ICP-MS. Arsenic speciation of all grains using spatially resolved X-ray absorption near edge structure (mu-XANES) and bulk extraction followed by anion exchange HPLC-ICP-MS revealed the presence of mainly inorganic As and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). However, the two techniques indicated different proportions of inorganic:organic As species. A wider survey of whole grain speciation of white (n = 39) and brown (n = 45) rice samples from numerous sources (field collected, supermarket survey, and pot trials) showed that brown rice had a higher proportion of inorganic arsenic present than white rice.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{understand}} whether genotypic differences in grain iron (Fe) concentration in four rice genotypes {{are related to}} its association with protein bodies containing phytate-rich inclusions. Rice genotypes with high and low grain Fe concentrations in <b>unpolished</b> brown <b>rice</b> were grown in a greenhouse at Chiang Mai, Thailand, and grains were harvested at maturity. The presence of protein bodies and phytate-rich inclusions in rice grain tissues were examined by means of light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The composition of mineral elements in different grain tissues was examined using energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX) and chemical analysis. The relative distribution pattern of protein bodies in the tissues was similar among the four rice genotypes, which resembled the pattern of grain N concentrations in these tissues. The high grain Fe genotypes (based on brown rice Fe concentration) had more protein bodies containing phytate-rich inclusions in the embryo and aleurone layer tissues than the low Fe genotypes. Phytate-rich inclusions were not detected in the endosperm tissues in all genotypes. In conclusion, the presence of protein bodies with phytate-rich inclusions predominantly in the embryo and aleurone regions of the grain is an important parameter contributing to the variation in brown rice Fe concentration among the genotypes, {{but not in the}} white rice (the endosperm). Iron associated with the phytate-rich inclusions present in the embryo and aleurone layer tissues are largely lost during the polishing process to produce white rice...|$|R

First, a national market basket survey (n = 240) was conducted in provincial capitals, sourcing grain from China's premier rice production areas. Second, to reflect rural diets, paddy rice (n = 195) directly from farmers fields were collected from three regions in Hunan, a key rice producing province located in southern China. Two of the sites were within mining and smeltery districts, and the third was devoid of large-scale metal processing industries. Arsenic levels were determined in all the samples while a subset (n = 33) were characterized for As species, using a new simple and rapid extraction method suitable for use with Hamilton PRP-X 100 anion exchange columns and HPLC-ICP-MS. The vast majority (85 %) of the market rice grains possessed total As levels < 150 ng g(- 1).

40|$|Thiamin {{diphosphate}} (ThDP), {{also known}} as vitamin B 1, serves as an enzymatic cofactor in glucose metabolism, the Krebs cycle, and branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis in all living organisms. Unlike plants and microorganisms, humans {{are not able to}} synthesize ThDP de novo and must obtain it from their diet. Staple crops such as rice are poor sources of thiamin. Hence, populations that mainly consume rice commonly suffer thiamin deficiency. In addition to thiamin’s nutritional function, studies in rice have shown that some thiamin biosynthesis genes are involved in resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae (Xoo), which causes a serious disease in rice fields. This study shows that overexpression of two thiamin biosynthesis genes, 4 -methyl- 5 -β-hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate synthase and 4 -amino- 2 -methyl- 5 -hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate synthase involved in the first steps of the thiazole and pyrimidine synthesis branches, respectively, increased thiamin content up to five-fold in unpolished seeds that retain the bran. However, thiamin levels in polished seeds with removed bran were similar to those found in polished control seeds. Plants with higher accumulation of thiamin did not show enhanced resistance to Xoo. These results indicate that stacking of two traits can enhance thiamin accumulation in <b>rice</b> <b>unpolished</b> grain. We discuss potential roadblocks that prevent thiamin accumulation in the endosperm...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} Kurozu concentrate (KC) based dietary supplement on several obesity-related parameters in obese Japanese male and female adults. Background: Kurozu, which is {{a specific type of}} rice vinegar produced by fermentation of <b>unpolished</b> brown <b>rice,</b> has long been used as a traditional health food and folk medicine in Japan. A recent animal study and our preliminary human study suggest that the KC supplement has potential for use in the management of obesity. Materials and Methods: A 12 -week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted involving 48 Japanese adult subjects (28 males and 20 females) with obesity. Subjects were either assigned to the group consuming the KC supplement for 12 weeks (870 mg/day; 480 mg/day as KC) (n= 24; 14 males and 10 females) or the placebo group (n= 24; 14 males and 10 females). All test participants were assessed using several obesity-related parameters, including body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and abdominal fat computed tomography (CT) sections. These measurements took place at baseline and at week 12. Results: At week 12, a significant decrease in body weight (P< 0. 043) and nearly significant decreased values of BMI (P= 0. 052) were observed in the KC group compared to the placebo group. The reduction in waist circumference at week 12 within the KC group was not significantly greater than the placebo group. Examination of abdominal CT sections around the navel indicated that, although most of the values of the total fat area, subcutaneous fat area, and visceral fat area for both of the placebo and KC groups significantly increased during the 12 -week intervention, the magnitude of increase in the total fat area for all subjects and that of the total fat area, subcutaneous fat area, and visceral fat area for females on one or more of three CT sections were significantly lower in the KC group than the placebo group (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Although the results are not definitive, KC supplementation may have potential for improving some obesity-related parameters in obese subjects, particularly females.
