50|$|Straight whiskey (or {{straight}} whisky), {{as defined}} in United States law, is whiskey created by distilling a fermented (malted or <b>unmalted)</b> <b>cereal</b> grain mash to create a spirit not exceeding 80% alcohol content by volume (abv) and then aging the spirit {{for at least two}} years at an abv concentration not exceeding 62.5% at the start of the aging process.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the efficiency of rye and barley starch hydrolysis in mashing processes using cereal malts as a source of amylolytic enzymes and starch, and to establish the volatile profile of the obtained agricultural distillates. In addition, the effects of the pretreatment method of <b>unmalted</b> <b>cereal</b> grains on the physicochemical composition of the prepared mashes, fermentation results, and the composition of the obtained distillates were investigated. The raw materials used were unmalted rye and barley grains, as well as the corresponding malts. All experiments were first performed on a semi-technical scale, and then verified under industrial conditions in a Polish distillery. The fermentable sugars present in sweet mashes mostly consisted of maltose, followed by glucose and maltotriose. Pressure-thermal treatment of unmalted cereals, and especially rye grains, resulted in higher ethanol content in mashes in comparison with samples subjected to pressureless liberation of starch. All agricultural distillates originating from mashes containing rye and barley grains and the corresponding malts were characterized by low concentrations of undesirable compounds, such as acetaldehyde and methanol. The distillates obtained under industrial conditions contained lower concentrations of higher alcohols (apart from 1 -propanol) than those obtained on a semi-technical scale...|$|E

5000|$|Under the {{regulations}} governing {{the production of}} both Irish and Scotch whisky, [...] "malt whisky" [...] must be produced from a mash of 100% malted barley, and must be distilled in a pot still. In Scotland, a whisky which either uses other malted or <b>unmalted</b> <b>cereals</b> in the mash (in addition to malted barley), and/or is distilled in a column still, is termed a [...] "grain whisky". Whereas, in Ireland, where regulations define an additional style, [...] "pot still whiskey", as that being distilled from a specific mixed mash in a pot still, [...] "grain whisky" [...] refers to whisky produced from a mixed mash of malt barley and other <b>unmalted</b> <b>cereals</b> in a column still.|$|R
40|$|<b>Unmalted</b> <b>cereals</b> or pseudocereals, {{including}} amaranth and quinoa can partially replace malt in beer production. Cereals, such as barley {{as well as}} malted grains {{are rich}} in β-glucan. During brewing it comes to wort and then is detected in the final product. The β-glucan is known to cause problems during wort and beer filtration, as it increases viscosity. Moreover, high molecular β-glucan may generate turbidity in the final product [1]. On the other hand, it can be advantageous from the nutritional point of view [2]. Substitution of malt with <b>unmalted</b> <b>cereals</b> or pseudocereals may even increase β-glucan content in wort and then in beer. It is connected with: (1) lower amount of malt being used and consequently lower β-glucanase activity, synthesized in grains during malting, (2) higher amount of high molecular polysaccharides coming from grains, which weren’t modified during malting [3]. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the changes in β-glucan content during wort and beer production when 10 or 30 % malt was replaced with unmalted quinoa or amaranth...|$|R
5000|$|Single grain Scotch whisky means a Scotch whisky {{distilled}} at {{a single}} distillery but, in addition to water and malted barley, may involve whole grains of other malted or <b>unmalted</b> <b>cereals.</b> [...] "Single grain" [...] {{does not mean that}} only a single type of grain was used to produce the whisky—rather, the adjective [...] "single" [...] refers only to the use of a single distillery (and making a [...] "single grain" [...] requires using a mixture of grains, as barley is a type of grain and some malted barley must be used in all Scotch whisky).|$|R
