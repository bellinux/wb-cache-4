In this study, the UV LED curing formulations of polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels were developed. The formulations consisted of acrylamide (AAm) as a main monomer, N,N’-methylenebisacrylamide as a crosslinker and photoinitiator. UV LED emits monochromatic light sources only (365 nm or 385 nm). Thus, in order to developed formulation of <b>UV</b> LED <b>curable</b> hydrogels, a suitable water soluble photoinitiator (i. e. λ ~ 365 nm) has to be employed. A commercially available photoinitiator Oligo [2 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 1 -[4 -(1 -methylvinyl) phenyl] propanone] under the trade name Chivacure 300 (λ ~ 330 nm) was chosen in the first formulations. However, due to limited solubility in water, addition of tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 9. 5 : 0. 5 ratio of water/THF was required for Chivacure 300. We also synthesized a photoinitiator based on 2, 2 -dimethoxy- 2 -phenyl acetophenone (DMPA) and methylated-ß-cyclodextrin (MßCD) {{to be used in}} the second formulation. The complexation of DMPA and MßCD resulted in transparent and water-soluble supramolecular-structured photoinitiator (SSPI) (λ ~ 330 nm). Both formulations were irradiated using UV LED system (Hoenle AG, Germany, 365 nm) for 15 min. Synthesis of PAAm hydrogels with both photoinitiators has yielded almost complete conversion of hydrogels (> 80 %). Clearly, this study has revealed that enhanced formulation of <b>UV</b> LED <b>curable</b> hydrogels are due to appropriate choice of excellent water-solubility photoinitiators (Chivacure 300 and modified DMPA).

The control experiment using commercial photoinitiators has shown that UV LED system was suitable to polymerize hydrogels provided that; photoinitiator has the overlap emission with UV LED spectra. However, most commercial photoinitiators have limited solubility in water. Thus, suitable water soluble photoinitiator (WSPI) for UV LED system (i. e. ? ? 330 - 365 nm) was prepared in order to synthesize <b>UV</b> LED <b>curable</b> hydrogel in purely water formulation. The water soluble photoinitiator was obtained from complexation of 2, 2 -dimethoxy- 2 -phenylacetophenone (DMPA) and methylated-ß-cyclodextrin (MßCD).

Three aspects concerning {{the reliability of}} MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) are discussed in this work. These aspects are: (1) {{the development of a}} new tensile testing technique for measuring the elastic modulus and rupture strengths of thin films, (2) an assessment of stress concentration and specimen size effects in failure of micron-sized specimens and (3) the consequences of Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) chemical treatment on the microstructural integrity and the tensile strength of polycrystalline silicon. A new method for tensile testing of thin films by means of an improved apparatus has been developed to measure the elastic properties (Young's modulus, tensile strength) of surface micromachined polycrystalline silicon specimens. The newly designed tensile tester makes use of an Ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> light <b>curable</b> adhesive to clamp micron-sized specimens. It permits for the first time the testing of thin film materials possessing high failure strength. The properties determination utilizes surface topologies of deforming specimens, acquired with an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), for determining strain fields by means of Digital Image Correlation (DIC). This full-field, direct and local measurements technique provides the capability of testing any type of thin film materials with nanometer resolution. The gage section of the specimens tested in this study varied between 200 and 1000 [ [...] . ] in length, 6 and 50 [ [...] . ] in width, all for a nominal thickness of 2 [ [...] . ]. The dependence of fracture strength on micron and sub-micron sized geometries was studied by means of specimens containing various degrees of stress concentrations. A systematic study of small-scale size effects was thus performed by tensioning elliptically perforated specimens (minimum radius of curvature of 1 gm) so as to: (a) vary the stress concentration with constant radius of curvature, (b) increasing radius of curvature of micronotches relative to the grain size. The results demonstrate a strong influence of the size of the highly strained domain (decreasing notch radii) on the failure strength of MEMS scale specimens, while the effect of varying the stress concentration factor is rather insignificant. In addition, tests performed on unnotched tensile specimens of varying dimensions revealed a specimen size effect by which the values of strength scaled with the specimen length. The Young's modulus, however, is found to be rather insensitive to the specimen dimensions at the scale of microns. In an effort to assess the unexplained and puzzling large variation in properties reported for very small polysilicon specimens a study was conducted to search for a cause.

The melting enthalpy of PCL has increased {{when the film}} thickness decreased and the peak melting temperature showed no significant changes with film thickness. Film thickness variation influenced surface roughness and crystal size. Optical microscope images showed the rougher surface of thicker films. The spinning time has shown no influence on film thickness and no significant changes to surface roughness. Thin films of block copolymers {{were used in the}} surface modification study; films studied included poly(styrene-b-butadiene-b-styrene) (SBS) and poly(styrene-b-isoprene-b-styrene) (SIS) and their surface modifications have been controlled using different methods of treatment. Films of SIS heated at different temperatures have shown different surface texture and roughness. Films treated at low temperature (45 °C) had smooth surfaces when compared with films heated at high temperature (120 °C and 160 °C). Phase separation of SIS heated at (120 °C and 160 °C) caused bulges of different sizes to cover the surface. The height and width of the bulges showed variation with film thickness and heating. Substrate interaction with SBS and SIS block copolymer films showed different surface texture when using the same type of substrate and different texture were obtained when SBS solutions were spun onto different substrates. It has been demonstrated that using different solvents in copolymer preparation caused different texture. Thermal and surface property variations with film thickness have been improved using amorphous polymers. Surface roughness of poly(methyl methacrylate) PMMA and disperse red 1 -poly(methyl methacrylate) DR 1 -PMMA, PMMA has improved using thickness variation. Glass transition temperature measurement has increased when film thickness was increased. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and surface roughness of UV 15 <b>UV</b> - <b>curable</b> coating polymer has been modified using UV curing and heating methods. Tg variation was observed when curing time and curing intensity were changed causing the optical properties of the polymer to be more variable. A plasma etcher caused wrinkles to occur on the surface of unheated UV 15. Tg of UV 15 increased when curing time increased. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of cured UV 15 film have shown peak variations of the ester and carbon double bond regions over the range of 1850 - 1700 cm- 1.
