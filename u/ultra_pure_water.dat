40|$|The Zweckverband Landeswasserversorgung Stuttgart has {{developed}} {{a new type of}} decarbonization system which makes possible the recovery of <b>ultra</b> <b>pure,</b> industrially usable calcium carbonate by using lime water as a coagulant. The decarbonization process itself takes place on a line of the existing compact flocculation system which is used in the Langenau Waterworks for the treatment of Danube <b>water.</b> The <b>ultra</b> <b>pure</b> lime <b>water</b> is produced in a newly developed lime water preparation system. The whole decarbonization plant was planned for a capacity of 700 l/s. It contains the following systems: slaking of calcium oxide, preparation of lime water, compact flocculation plant, wet ball crusher, storage of thin sludge, centrifuges and loading station for the <b>ultra</b> <b>pure</b> thickened CaCO_ 3 sludge. With the exception of the compact flocculation plant all other parts of the plant had to be built new. After the prototype was put into operation, the lime water preparation system, the wet ball crusher and the centrifuges had to be optimized. Afterwards the whole plant worked very well. Up to now 65 million m" 3 ground water was decarbonized and 50, 000 t of pure CaCO_ 3 have been produced and sold. The sale solves the disposal problems and contributes to covering the operating costs of decarbonization. (orig.)

Samples of air-dry soil and 50 mL of <b>ultra</b> <b>pure</b> distilled <b>water</b> were placed into closed centrifuge tubes as well palygroskite. The contact time for the experiments was 1 h for twenty times, during which the soil suspensions were shaked at 20 ± 1 °C. The supernatants were separated by centrifugation and decantation. EC and pH, Na + and Mg 2 + concentrations were measured The X-ray data and calculation of the palygroskite/quartz (P/Q) ratio showed that the pure palygroskite decreased by 20 % after leaching, whereas, mica and smectite minerals appeared. In silt loam soil, palygroskite increased by 20 %. While, mica disappeared from sandy clay soil after leaching and palygroskite has been increased by 10 %. In sandy loam soil, smectite decreased by 16 %, while palygroskite and kaolinite were not found before leaching and semectite has been decreased by 16 % as indicated by P/Q ratio which decreased from 1. 8 to 1. 20 %.

40|$|After the {{discovery}} of ion-mediated changes in xylem hydraulic resistance a few years ago, a number of research papers were published that related ion-mediated flow changes in the xylem to various aspects of whole plant functioning and evolutionary diversification of vascular cells. Ion-mediated changes in xylem hydraulic resistance are commonly quantified as the percentile change in hydraulic resistance, relative to the hydraulic resistance measured using a reference fluid, usually (<b>ultra)</b> <b>pure</b> deionized <b>water.</b> In this research the impact was investigated of the complete absence of all ions in deionized water compared with reference fluids containing a minimal amount of free calcium on the quantification of ion-mediated flow changes in stem segments of Chrysanthemum (Dendranthemaxgrandiflorum Tzvelev) and Prunus L. (Prunus laurocerasus L.). The addition of 10 mM KCl to deionized water significantly increased flow rate in Chrysanthemum (17 ¿ 24 %) and Prunus L. (16 %). The addition of 1 mM CaCl 2 to the reference fluid reduced this KCl-mediated increase in flow rate to 1 ¿ 2 % in both species. 1 mM Ca 2 + is within the lower range of Ca 2 +-concentrations normally measured in xylem sap of many plant species, and three times lower than the original Ca 2 +-concentration measured in the xylem sap of Chrysanthemum plants used for the present measurements. The present {{results indicate that the}} complete removal of cations from the xylem fluid with deionized water causes the major part of the ion-mediated flow change previously reported in the xylem of plants. It is concluded that the use of deionized water as a reference fluid should be avoided. Earlier proposed relationships between ion-mediated changes and water flow in xylem of plants should be re-evaluated if they were based on deionized water as the reference flui...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA Best Practice Guideline about Dialysis fluid purity was {{developed}} {{under the leadership}} of the Spanish Society of Nephrology in 2004. The second edition revised Guideline considered new evidences and International Standard. The guideline has established recommendations for standards for preparing dialysate: water, concentrates and haemodialysis proportioning systems. This guideline is based on the ISO 13959, European Pharmacopoeia, the Real Farmacopea Española, the AAMI Standards and Recommended Practices, European Best Practice Guidelines for Haemodialysis, literature reviews, according to their level of evidence, and the opinion of the expert Spanish group. Two levels of quality of water were defined: purified water and high purified <b>water</b> (<b>ultra</b> <b>pure)</b> and for dialysate: <b>ultra</b> <b>pure</b> dialysate. Regular use of <b>ultra</b> <b>pure</b> dialysate is recommended for all type of haemodialysis to prevent and delay the occurrence of complications: inflammation, malnutrition, anaemia and amiloidosis. Water, concentrates and dialysate quality requirements are defined as maximum allowable contaminant levels: chemicals (4. 1. 2), conductivity, microbial and endotoxins (4. 1. 1) :Microbial (CFU/ml) Endotoxins LAL test (EU/ml) Purified water≤ 100 CFU/ml≤ 0. 25 High purified water≤ 10 CFU/ 100 ml≤ 0. 03 <b>Ultra</b> <b>pure</b> dialysate≤ 10 CFU/ 100 ml≤ 0. 03 Monitoring frequency, maintenance and corrective actions were specified. Methods of sampling and analysis were described in Appendix. For microbiological monitoring, R 2 A medium is recommended, incubated during 7 – 14 days at a temperature of 17 – 23 °C. The dialysate quality assurance process involves all dialysis staff members and requires strict protocols. The physician in charge of haemodialysis has the ultimate responsibility for dialysate quality. All suggestions and questions about this Guideline are welcome to www. senefro. org...|$|R
40|$|Case StudySilicon carbide (SiC) {{is known}} for its {{superior}} abrasion resistance, and is widely used in pumps as a material for water-lubricated sliding bearings. <b>Ultra</b> <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> (UPW), with a specific resistance of greater than 10 M?/cm, is often used for purposes such as washing water in semiconductor manufacturing processes and recirculation water in nuclear power generation plants. However, in cases where SiC sliding bearings are lubricated with <b>ultra</b> <b>pure</b> <b>water,</b> abnormal wear is occasionally found. Such a problem is not seen with normal water lubrication. The abnormal wear when lubricated with UPW is caused by oxidation of the SiC surface and generation of silicon dioxide.

40|$|In {{this study}} the microstructures of laser treated <b>ultra</b> <b>pure</b> Al and two Al-Si alloys (Al- 0. 4 Si and Al- 0. 75 Si) were investigated. In <b>ultra</b> <b>pure</b> Al {{a large number}} of {{dislocation}} loops were found especially at higher laser scan velocities. During annealing only at laser scan velocities above 2 cm/s a large quantity of dislocation loops became visible. Both results indicate that at high laser velocities vacancies are frozen in, but at laser velocities around 1 cm/s there is still enough time at high temperature to reduce the vacancy concentration towards lower super-saturation. In Al-Si alloys the dislocation density rises with higher laser scan velocities probably caused by the smaller distances between the eutectic cell walls. In these alloys entangled dislocation structures were found in contrast to <b>ultra</b> <b>pure</b> Al. For solidification structures consisting of an eutectic material with a high hardness as for an eutectic structure in Al-Si alloys {{it was found that the}} hardness can be described by a pile up mechanism, which depends on the difficulty to exert stresses on neighbouring cells due to thick and hard walls The hardness has been described by a 1 /d 2 dependence, i. e. it is mainly determined by the small size d, of the solidification structure...|$|R
