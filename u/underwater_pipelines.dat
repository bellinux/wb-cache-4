500|$|The first {{components}} of the Mulberry harbours were brought across the Channel on D+1 and the structures were in use for unloading by mid-June.

The most important use of the Mulberry harbour was the unloading of heavy machinery that could not be brought across the beaches. Artificial breakwaters (Gooseberries) sheltered hundreds of ships during the storm of 17–23 June, and provided shelter for craft unloading stores at Juno and Sword.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} the control problem of inspecting <b>underwater</b> <b>pipeline</b> on the seabed, with coordinated multiple autonomous underwater vehicles in a formation. Based on the leader-follower strategy, the dedicated nonlinear path following controller is rigorously built on Lyapunov-based design, driving {{a fleet of}} vehicles onto assigned parallel paths elevated and offset from the <b>underwater</b> <b>pipeline,</b> while keeping a triangle formation to capture complete 3 D images for inspection. Due to the spatial-temporal decoupling characteristics of individual path following controller, the velocities of the followers can be adapted in the coordinated control level, only relying on the information of generalized along-path length from the leader, {{in order to build}} the desired formation. Thus, the communication variable broadcast from the leader is kept to a minimum, which is feasible under the severely constraints of acoustic communication bandwidth. Simulation results illustrate the efficiency of coordinated formation controller proposed for <b>underwater</b> <b>pipeline</b> inspection...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} research paper is to investigate the issues of pipeline detection, including pose and orientation measurements in underwater environments.

The B-spline based active contour is used to define the <b>underwater</b> <b>pipeline</b> boundaries in image sequence, followed by series of image processing techniques are applied for feature extraction. The active contour deformed based on extracted features.

The Kalman filter updates the state of underwater object. Moreover, it also provides guidance and control to the vehicle when cable or pipeline is fully or partially covered by the sand or marine flora. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed system, the system is tested on real underwater images. From the experimental results, it is observed that the maximum error is less then 10 pixels which show the robustness of tracking algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Wave-induced seabed {{liquefaction}} and {{shear failure}} {{have been identified}} as important mechanisms of submarine buried pipelines failure. Most previous studies evaluated the potential of seabed instability around <b>underwater</b> <b>pipelines</b> using two-dimensional numerical/analytical solutions. In real ocean environments, however, waves can approach the pipeline from an oblique direction. In this study, a three-dimensional FE numerical model is established and validated to simulate the wave-seabed-pipeline interaction. The seabed consolidation under the dynamic loading of ocean waves is simulated to evaluate the wave-induced seabed response. Simulation results are used to carry an instability analysis around pipeline. The numerical study reveals that the risk of seabed shear failure near the pipeline is considerably dependant to the wave angle of incidence...|$|E

40|$|For the {{engineering}} design of <b>underwater</b> <b>pipelines</b> and communication cables in freezing seas, reliable {{estimates of the}} frequency and penetration depth of ice-keel scour on the seabed and shoreface are required. Underestimation of ice gouging intensity on the seabed {{can lead to the}} infrastructure damage, while overestimation leading to excessive burial depth raises the cost of construction. Here we present results from recent studies of ice gouge morphology in Baydaratskaya Bay, Kara Sea. The direct impact of ice gouging by floes on the seabed and shores is described, generalized and systematized: the depth of the gouges varies from the first centimeters up to 2  m; the most intensive ice gouging is observed near the fast ice rim, due to the maximum impact executed by ice ridges frozen into large floe. We propose a zonation of Baydaratskaya Bay based on the types of ice formation and the intensity of ice impacts on the coasts and sea floor. </span...|$|E

Speed of sedimentation of an active impurity depends on density, the form and the sizes of particles, quantity of the oil absorbed by them, and also from temperature and salinity of water. All these factors we will estimate integrally using concept of hydraulic fineness – speeds of uniform sedimentation of a separate particle under the influence of gravity in great volume of based water.

40|$|To {{be able to}} make a succesful {{project in}} ice {{conditions}} one must have sufficient data on the design conditions. For instance each component in an oil export system like onshore pipelines/ terminals, <b>underwater</b> <b>pipelines,</b> offloading terminals, assistant icebreakers and export transportation vessels, has design requirements of its own. The design of ships mainly are dependent on fairway and ice conditions and offshore loading terminals on soil conditions in the seabed as well. A design basis must be made for each component of the system. It requires a considerable amount of work, both data collection in the field and reviews of literature as well as analyses to make a reliable design basis. This is the first step.
