40|$|Occurrence of {{equilibrium}} and non equilibrium {{system dynamics}} in semiarid environments present serious management challenges. In these areas, resource management strategies are increasingly based on equilibrium rather than non equilibrium dynamics that assume simple system dynamics and strong coupling of animal-plant responses. This management approach underlies increasing trends of range degradation and low livestock productivity in these environments. To reverse these trends dictates greater understanding and alignment of grazing resource extraction strategies {{in space and}} time to prevailing system dynamics behaviour. In this study, range use patterns by free ranging herds under agropastoral herding were studied in two cycles of four consecutive grazing periods, in semiarid southeastern Kenya. The bites count and herd locations per area methods were used. While grazing thresholds in the system were derived from biweekly sward biomass measured by the quadrant technique in the growing period and stocking rates applied to a growth-consumption rate model. The analysis tested the responsiveness of the agropastoral herding strategies to the predominant system dynamics in the area. In this environment, high rainfall variability ranging from 71 to 98 % is experienced across years and seasons, pointing to non-equilibrium dynamics in the system. The agropastoralists practiced seasonal range use and tracking strategies. During the dry season, areas of concentrated drainage; river valleys, bottomlands and ephemeral drainage ways absorbed a greater grazing load, taking 57. 1 to 60 % of the grazing time by the animals. In contrast, areas of limited moisture concentration, the open sandy/clay plains, were mainly exploited in the wet season and accounted for 52. 6 to 55. 6 % of the grazing time. The agropastoralists tracked forage availability through use of multispecies livestock (cattle, goats and sheep) that exploited different grazing resources {{in space and time}}. These range use patterns and strategies tend to stabilize nutrient and energy flow to livestock and thus productivity throughout the seasons. Based on the growth-consumption rate model, grazing thresholds in the system are achieved at 13800, 13000, 4000 and 12300, 4600 and 12000, and 5600 and 11000 kgha- 1 of grass biomass at, 2. 5, 5, 7, 8 and 10 TLUha- 1, respectively. 7 TLUha- 1 represent the <b>upper</b> <b>stocking</b> rate limit in the system during the growing period. In this system, resource use strategies are in line with the predominantly non-equilibrium system behaviour. However, sedentary land use interventions and limiting farm sizes that restrict livestock mobility and negatively affect grazing resource diversity will undermine system stability and sustainable livestock production in the area...|$|R

The expanding use of stock options is undoubtedly {{due in part to}} the large increase in equity prices over the last twenty years. Further fueling the demand was the Internet start-up boom of the late 1990 s, the spectacular financial success of many technology and computer companies, notably Microsoft and Oracle, and the well- publicized lucre acquired by their employees. The collapse of the initial public offerings market for Internet start-up companies at the dawn of the twenty-first century, accompanied by the rapid decline in the stock prices of many companies in technology-related sectors, served to apprise employees that option returns are risky. Microsoft 2 ÃÜ 7 s recent announcement that it plans to replace its option program with a restricted stock program will undoubtedly cause many companies to reevaluate their use of compensatory options.

A total of 2, 860 fish were radio tagged during 2002 - 2004. Most (97. 5 %) of the fish tracked upriver to spawning areas displayed continual upriver movements and strong fidelity to the terminal tributaries entered. Movement rates were substantially slower for fish spawning in lower river tributaries (28 - 40 km d- 1) compared to <b>upper</b> basin <b>stocks</b> (52 - 62 km d- 1). Three distinct migratory patterns were observed, including a gradual decline, pronounced decline, and substantial increase in movement rate as the fish moved upriver. Stocks destined for the same region exhibited similar migratory patterns. Individual fish within a stock showed substantial variation, but tended to reflect the regional pattern. Differences between consistently faster and slower fish explained 74 % of the within-stock variation, whereas relative shifts in sequential movement rates between "hares" (faster fish becoming slower) and "tortoises" (slow but steady fish) explained 22 % of the variation. Pulses of fish moving upriver were not cohesive. Fish tagged over a 4 -day period took 16 days to pass a site 872 km upriver. Movement rates were substantially faster {{and the percentage of}} atypical movements considerably less than reported in more southerly drainages, but may reflect the pristine conditions within the Yukon River, wild origins of the fish, and discrete run timing of the returns.

Both stocks have been placed under a conservation and recovery plan since their listing, including an immediate hatchery mitigation program. The primary reason for their reduction in numbers is a complete recruitment failure caused primarily by anthropogenic changes to their historical spawning grounds. While research is being conducted to determine the exact cause of recruitment failure, hatcheries have begun to produce and release juvenile white sturgeon {{in an effort to}} preserve both stocks until a naturally breeding population can be re-established. This document covers some of the research into causes of recruitment failure as well as improved techniques for management of hatchery-raised white sturgeon.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze {{sustainability}} issues of Japan%u 2019 s fiscal policy and then to discuss the debt management policy using the theoretical models and numerical studies. We also investigate the desirable coordination of fiscal and monetary authorities toward fiscal reconstruction. We include a potential possibilities of the government bonds in our theoretical model. The public bonds, therefore, cannot be sold when the issuance leads the amount of debt outstanding to be more than a certain level. In this respect, the fiscal authority has to take into account the <b>upper</b> limit of <b>stocks</b> of public debt. This possibility of debt default provides the fiscal authority to issue public bonds strategically in an earlier period. A strategic behavior of fiscal authority induces the monetary authority, in a later period, to boost output and raise seigniorage revenues to eliminate the distortion of resource allocation due to the limitation on debt issuance. Therefore, the monetary policy in a later period suffers from an inflation bias from the ax ante point of view. There are two ways to eliminate this distortion toward successful fiscal restoration. One of them is to make the monetary authority more conservative than society in the sense that the price stability weight of monetary authority is higher than that of society. The other way of eliminating the distortion of the resource allocation is to design an institutional ceiling on the debt issuance. The direct ceiling can provide a binding constraint of the public bond issuance for the fiscal authority of Japan because it has accumulated the debt outstanding much more than other countries. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, {{returning}} to the Yukon River basin and other large river systems in western Alaska have declined dramatically since the late 1990 s. This continuing trend has raised concerns over the future status of the returns, and severely impacted commercial and subsistence fisheries within the drainage. Management is further complicated by the mixed-stock composition of the run, {{the presence of other}} temporally similar salmon species, and the need to equitably allocate harvests between the numerous fisheries and user groups scattered throughout the basin. Detailed information is needed on Chinook salmon run characteristics to better understand and manage the returns, and facilitate conservation efforts. However, this goal is exacerbated by the massive size and remote nature of the basin, the large number of highly mobile fish, and the compressed timing of the run. To address these challenges, radio telemetry was used to determine the stock composition and spawning distribution of the returns, and the migratory characteristics of the fish. The migratory patterns exhibited by returning salmon provide a number of insights into the status of the run. Since the Yukon River is essentially free-flowing (i. e., not regulated), this study also presented an opportunity to document the distribution and upriver movements of large returns of wild Chinook salmon under natural conditions. During 2002 - 2004, returning adult Chinook salmon were captured in the lower Yukon River (approximately 300 km upriver from the river mouth), tagged with radio transmitters, and tracked upriver using remote tracking stations located on important migratory routes and major spawning tributaries. Aerial tracking surveys were used to locate fish in spawning areas and between stations. The fish responded well to the capture and handling procedures, with most (2, 790, 98 %) resuming upriver movements. Although the fish initially displayed a negative tagging response, with slower migration rates observed immediately after release, the duration of this response was relatively short (several days) and less severe as the fish moved upriver. Independent measures indicated that the swimming speeds and timing of the fish upriver from the tagging area were comparable to untagged fish, suggesting that the tagging methods used were relatively benign. Fish returned to spawning areas throughout the basin, ranging from several hundred to over 3, 000 km from the tagging area. Distribution patterns were similar across years, suggesting that the principal components of the run were identified. Most spawning fish were clustered in a number of key tributaries, with smaller numbers of fish located in other spatially isolated areas. The fish typically returned to clear water tributaries that were relatively entrenched, had moderate gradients, and were associated with upland areas. Fish were largely absent in lowland reaches characterized by meandering, low gradient, highly alluvial channels often associated with main river floodplains. There was suggestive evidence of mainstem spawning in reaches of the Upper Yukon. The status of fish remaining in other mainstem areas was less certain, and may represent local spawning activity or fish that died while in-transit to upriver areas. Although Chinook salmon spawned throughout the basin, the run was dominated by two regional components (Tanana and Upper Yukon), which annually comprised over 70 % of the return. Substantially fewer fish returned to other areas ranging from 2 - 9 % of the return, although the collective contribution of these stocks was appreciable. Most regional returns consisted of several principal stocks and a number of small, spatially isolated populations. Regional and stock composition estimates were similar across years even though differences in run abundance were reported, suggesting that these abundance differences were not related to regional or stock-specific differences. Run timing was relatively compressed compared to rivers in the southern portion of the range, with most stocks passing through the lower river over a 6 -week period, ranging from 16 to 38 d. Run timing was generally earlier for stocks traveling farther upriver, although exceptions were noted. Lower basin stocks were primarily later run fish. Pronounced differences were observed in the migration rates (km/d) exhibited by regional stocks. Substantially slower swimming speeds were observed for fish {{returning to}} terminal tributaries in the lower basin ranging from 28 - 40 km/d compared to 52 - 62 km/d for <b>upper</b> basin <b>stocks.</b> The migratory patterns (migration rates in sequential reaches) of the fish also showed distinct regional differences. Average migration rates through the lower river were remarkably similar for the different stocks, ranging from 57 - 62 km/d, with most stocks exhibiting a general decline as the fish moved farther upriver. Tanana River stocks displayed a pronounced reduction in swimming speed after leaving the Yukon River main stem, with migration rates declining to 24 km/d on average as the fish approached their terminal tributaries. Conversely, <b>upper</b> basin <b>stocks</b> exhibited a relatively gradual (but variable) overall decline in migration rate even though these fish were traveling substantially greater distances upriver. Average migration rates for <b>upper</b> basin <b>stocks</b> ranged from 43 - 61 km/d as the fish approached their terminal tributaries. There was substantial variation in the migratory patterns exhibited by individual fish, although these patterns tended to be similar to the patterns exhibited by the regional stocks, particularly as the fish moved farther upriver from the tagging area. The dominant source of variation among fish reflected the average migration rate, with individual fish traveling slower in the lower basin exhibiting consistently slower migration rates as they moved upriver compared to their faster moving counterparts. This migratory pattern was consistent across stocks, and on average explained 74 % of the within-stock variation in migration rate represented by the multivariate data. The second source of variation in migration rate reflected a shift in the relative swimming speeds of the individual fish as they progressed upriver. Although movement rates declined for nearly all of the fish during the migration, differences were observed in the pattern of the decline. Fish with faster migration rates in the lower river exhibited a pronounced decline in swimming speed as they moved upriver, whereas fish moving slower in the lower river displayed a more gradual decline in migration rate. On average, this migratory pattern explained 22 % of the within-stock variation in migration rate represented by the multivariate data. Most fish (98 %) exhibited continuous upriver movements and strong fidelity to the rivers they entered. However a small number of fish (n = 66) deviated from this pattern. Some of these individuals initially passed their final destination and continued upriver for varying distances before reversing direction, swimming back downstream, and entering their terminal tributary. Although most of these excursions were relatively short (< 30 km), there were several instances where fish traveled hundreds of kilometers out of their way. Thirty-four fish tracked to terminal tributaries subsequently left these rivers, and traveled to other terminal tributaries within the basin (n = 31) or were harvested in upriver fisheries (n = 3). Although most of these incidents involved nearby tributaries, major diversions were also observed, with several fish traveling over 300 km to natal rivers after leaving the initial tributary. Chinook salmon returns to the Yukon River typically consisted of a series of distinct and sizable increases in the number fish entering the river {{over the course of the}} run, commonly referred to as pulses. A large number of fish (n = 251) were radio tagged over a 4 -day period during a pulse in 2003 to provide information on the progression of the pulse as it moved upriver. The time taken by the pulse to move past subsequent upriver locations increased as the fish moved farther upriver from the tagging area, with the fish passing sites located 580 and 800 km upriver over a span of 14 and 21 d, respectively. Although not surprising considering the extensive variation in migration rates observed among individual fish, this finding does suggest that these pulses do not represent cohesive aggregates of fish moving upriver. Unlike the well established methods used to estimate other life history characteristics, the development of quantitative methods for analyzing and modeling fish movements has lagged noticeably behind, due in part to the complexity associated with movement data and (prior to the advent of telemetry) the difficulty of collecting this type of information on free-ranging individuals. Two fundamentally different analytical approaches, hierarchical linear regression models and multivariate ordination, were used during this study to evaluate factors thought to influence the upriver movements of the fish. In spite of the inherent differences, both methods provided strikingly similar results, indicating that the study findings were not dependent on the approach used, and suggesting that the results were plausible based on the information available and the weight of evidence. Both analytical methods had advantages, and provided complementary information. With hierarchical linear models, it was possible to simultaneously evaluate a wide range of explanatory variables (in our case, both biological and environmental), which provided standardized comparisons and simplified the interpretation of the results. Since both fixed and random effects were incorporated in the models, it was possible to account for sources of variation when insufficient information was available to identify the underlining factors ‚Äì an important consideration since few field studies provide comprehensive data. With multivariate ordination, separate analyzes were needed to examine the relationships between the migration rates and the biotic and physical variables. In addition to being cumbersome, this limitation made it more difficult to compare the relative influence of the different factors and interactions between factors. However, ordination was very useful as an exploratory tool. Although compartmentalized by stock, across fish comparisons were simple and relatively straightforward. Because the explanatory variables were evaluated separately in relation to the ordination score assigned to the fish, it was possible to examine and compare highly correlated variables. Ordination was also able to identify overall patterns within the data and assess the relative importance. While this can be accomplished within the framework of linear regression using mixture models to determine whether multiple distributions exist within the data, the process is much simpler with ordination. The migratory patterns of the fish were influenced by a wide range of factors, with evidentiary support for complex, multi-faceted relationships. Physical features of the basin demonstrated stronger explanatory power, accounting for over 70 % of the observed variation in migration rate compared to 18 % for the biological characteristics of the fish. Parameter estimates associated with the steepness of the migratory route and remaining distance the fish had to travel to reach their natal rivers were most strongly correlated with migration rate, with consistent relationships observed across stocks. Migration rates were also noticeably slower in extensively braided reaches of the basin. The weaker relationships between migration rate and biotic factors may reflect stabilizing selection on long-distance migrants. Smaller fish exhibited minimally faster swimming speeds on average than larger individuals. This relationship was stronger in highly braided reaches. Run timing was positively related to migration rate for most <b>stocks.</b> Surprisingly, <b>upper</b> basin <b>stocks</b> traveling farther upriver displayed progressively negative relationships, suggesting that late-run fish were moving slower. Ancillary information suggests that this decline may relate to deteriorating fish condition later in the season...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} chemical transport Problems involving maritime pick up from and delivery to storage tanks that are continuously filled and drained. More specifically, we developed decision technology {{to determine the}} efficient use of multi compartment bulk ships to transport chemical products while ensuring continuous production with no stock-outs, so that the inventory level of chemical products in storage tanks are maintained between prescribed <b>upper</b> and lower <b>stock</b> levels during the planning horizon. Due {{to the nature of}} the products, it is impossible to carry more than two products without these being separated into dedicated compartments of the ships. We need to decide how much of each product to carry, on which ship, subject to the conditions that all harbors must have sufficient product to meet demand, and the stock levels of the products cannot exceed the inventory capacity of that harbor. We have formulated this ship-routing problem as a combined multi-ship pickup-delivery problem with inventory constraints. The original problem is a large-scale non-convex mixed-integer programming problem. All non-convexities involved weighted sums of products of two variables, one of which is binary and the other is continuous but bounded. We have shown that the structure gives rise to an equivalent large-scale linear mixed-integer programming problem (MILP). We studied the underlying structure of the MILP and developed a solution strategy by Lagrangian relaxation method for this large scale MILP with special structure. We also devised heuristic methods that are fast and find a good solution and conducted numerical studies that show how good does the heuristic solution compared to the dual bounds. Ph. D.

40|$|We {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} Columbia River flow, and survival from hatchery release to recovery of adults in catch and escapement for Columbia River chinook salmon. The only hatchery that was above the lower river dams and had a long time series of coded wire tag (CWT) release groups was the fall chinook stock at Priest Rapids hatchery. The survival as estimated by virtual population analysis (VPA) does show an increase with increasing flow. However, {{it is clear that}} major changes in survival at Priest Rapids hatchery were also seen in lower river hatcheries, and are presumably due to changes in general ocean condition. To correct for these ocean changes, we used lower river hatcheries as controls on ocean condition. The relationship between flow and survival when corrected for ocean condition shows a stronger correlation, which is highly significant. The slope indicates that an increase in flow of 100, 000 cfs at McNary dam would result in 65 % increase in survival of Priest Rapids hatchery fish. We {{explored the}} sensitivity of these results to the choice of statistical models, and the inclusion of experimental CWT groups. All sensitivity tests we conducted indicated a significant relationship between flow and survival. The study does have a number of weaknesses. including the fact that only the Priest Rapids hatchery stock was available to test the relationship between flow and survival. and this stock passed only through the four lower river dams. No Snake River or <b>upper</b> Columbia hatchery <b>stocks</b> were available for testing.

40|$|Concentrations {{of total}} organic carbon (TOC) were {{determined}} on samples collected during six cruises in the northern Arabian Sea during the 1995 US JGOFS Arabian Sea Process Study. Total organic carbon concentrations and integrated <b>stocks</b> in the <b>upper</b> ocean varied both spatially and seasonally. Highest mixed-layer TOC concentrations (80 - 100 ¬µM C) were observed near the coast when upwelling was not active, while upwelling tended to reduce local concentrations. In the open ocean, highest mixed-layer TOC concentrations (80 - 95 ¬µM C) developed in winter (period of the NE Monsoon) and remained through mid summer (early to mid-SW Monsoon). Lowest open ocean mixed-layer concentrations (65 - 75 ¬µM C) occurred late in the summer (late SW Monsoon) and during the Fall Intermonsoon period. The changes in TOC concentrations resulted in seasonal variations in mean TOC <b>stocks</b> (<b>upper</b> 150 m) of 1. 5 - 2 mole C/m** 2, with the lowest stocks found late in the summer during the SW Monsoon-Fall Intermonsoon transition. The seasonal accumulation of TOC north of 15 ¬∞N was 31 - 41 x 10 ** 12 g C, mostly taking place over {{the period of the}} NE Monsoon, and equivalent to 6 - 8 % of annual primary production estimated for that region in the mid- 1970 s. A net TOC production rate of 12 mmole C/m** 2 /d over the period of the NE Monsoon represented ~ 80 % of net community production. Net TOC production was nil during the SW Monsoon, so vertical export would have dominated the export terms over that period. Total organic carbon concentrations varied in vertical profiles with the vertical layering of the water masses, with the Persian Gulf Water TOC concentrations showing a clear signal. Deep water (> 2000 m) TOC concentrations were uniform across the basin and over the period of the cruises, averaging 42. 3 ¬± 1. 4 ¬µM C...|$|R
40|$|Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and {{chinook salmon}} (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) {{populations in the}} Northwest are decreasing. Genetic {{diversity}} is being lost at an alarming rate. Along with reduced population and genetic variability, the loss of biodiversity means a diminished environmental adaptability. The Nez Perce Tribe (Tribe) strives to ensure availability of genetic samples of the existing male salmonid population by establishing and maintaining a germplasm repository. The sampling strategy, initiated in 1992, has been to collect and preserve male salmon and steelhead genetic diversity across the geographic landscape by sampling within the major river subbasins in the Snake River basin, assuming a metapopulation structure existed historically. Gamete cryopreservation conserves genetic diversity in a germplasm repository, but is not a recovery action for listed fish species. The Tribe was funded in 2001 by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service Lower Snake River Compensation Plan (LSRCP) to coordinate gene banking of male gametes from Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed steelhead and spring and summer chinook salmon in the Snake River basin. In 2001, a total of 398 viable chinook salmon semen samples from the Lostine River, Catherine Creek, upper Grande Ronde River, Lookingglass Hatchery (Imnaha River stock), Lake Creek, the South Fork Salmon River weir, Johnson Creek, Big Creek, Capehorn Creek, Marsh Creek, Pahsimeroi Hatchery, and Sawtooth Hatchery (<b>upper</b> Salmon River <b>stock)</b> were cryopreserved. Also, 295 samples of male steelhead gametes from Dworshak Hatchery, Fish Creek, Grande Ronde River, Little Sheep Creek, Pahsimeroi Hatchery and Oxbow Hatchery were also cryopreserved. The Grande Ronde chinook salmon captive broodstock program stores 680 cryopreserved samples at the University of Idaho as a long-term archive, half of the total samples. A total of 3, 206 cryopreserved samples from Snake River basin steelhead and spring and summer chinook salmon, from 1992 through 2001, are stored in two independent locations at the University of Idaho (UI) and Washington State University (WSU). Two large freezer tanks are located at each university. Recommendations for future gene banking efforts include the need for establishment of a regional genome resource bank, an emphasis on cryopreserving wild unmarked fish, continued fertility trials, and genetic analysis on all fish represented in the germplasm repository...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The Murderers Creek Area, {{within the}} Aldrich Mountain {{province}} of northeast Oregon, originated in an arc-trench gap during Permian-early Triassic time. The area represents {{a small portion}} of a forearc depositional basin and tectonic highland which borders the basin along its seaward margin. The trench associated with an east dipping subduction was located to the northwest of the area, bordering the melange highland. The rocks of the Murderers Creek Area are divided into pre-Tertiary and Tertiary rock assemblages on the basis of genetic differences. The pre-Tertiary rock assemblage reflects an active subduction of oceanic lithosphere in an island arc environment isolated from the North American craton. This assemblage of rocks includes: (1) a melange (Permian-Triassic) of ophiolitic peridotites, gabbros, greenstones, cherts, and argillites encased in a highly sheared serpentine matrix; (2) the Vester Formation (Karnian) containing lutites, greywackes, olistostromal blocks, and minor tuffs, derived for the most part from the melange and deposited in a forearc basin formed by the uplift of the melange terrain; (3) the Fields Creek Formation (Norian) including siliceous lutites, greywackes, and large olistostromal masses all derived from the uplifted melange and Vester Formation and deposited in a forearc basin together with injected submarine lavas and arc derived tuffs; and (4) the Fields Peak <b>stock</b> (<b>upper</b> Jurassic-lower Cretaceous) granodiorite to tonalite in composition, representing part of the intrusive event which marked the effective consolidation of the island arc province to the North American craton. The post-Cretaceous rock assemblage reflects a relatively stable cratonic margin and includes: (1) the Clarno Formation (Eocene) volcanic mudflows and breccias; (2) the Columbia River Group (middle Miocene) flood basalts; (3) basalts and glacial terrace gravels (Quaternary). Structurally the Murderers Creek Area has a two stage character with early structures (Permian through Jurassic) related to an east-west compression of the area associated with the subduction of oceanic lithosphere, and with late structures (Cretaceous through Recent) associated with stresses affecting a relatively stable cratonic margin. Early structures include: (1) a northeast to northwest shearing of the melange terrain, following the arcuate trend of the unit, (2) tight isoclinal folding of the Vester Formation along northeast axes, (3) tight isoclinal folding of the Fields Creek Formation and cross folding of the Vester Formation along north to northwest axes also following the arcuate trend of the units...|$|R
40|$|Core {{activities}} of the Grande Ronde Endemic Spring Chinook Supplementation Program (GRESCSP) are funded through {{the authority of the}} Lower Snake River Fish and Wildlife Compensation Plan (LSRCP). The LSRCP program was approved by the Water Resources Development Act of 1976, PL 94 - 587, Section 102, 94 th Congress substantially in accordance with the Special Report, LSRCP, June 1975 on file with the Chief of Engineers. The LSRCP was prepared and submitted in compliance with the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, PL 85 - 624, 85 th Congress, August 12, 1958 to mitigate for the losses of fish and wildlife caused by the construction of dams on lower Snake River. The GRESCSP is an artificial propagation program that was initiated by Bonneville Power Administrations Fish and Wildlife program in the mid 1990 's. The intent of this program was to change the mitigation aspect of the LSRCP program (harvest mitigation) to an integrated supplementation program; inasmuch as, hatchery produced fish could be experimentally used as a recovery tool and fish surplus to mitigation would be available for in-place and in-kind harvest. Fish production is still authorized by the LSRCP with the original mitigation return goal of 5, 860 adult spring Chinook to the project area. The GRESCSP was developed with two primary components: (1) conventional broodstock (projects 199800702; 199800703; 199800704) and (2) captive brood (projects 199801001; 199801006). The GRESCSP relies on cooperative M&E efforts from the LSRCP including setting aside the Wenaha and Minam tributaries as natural production reserves components used for reference streams. The GRESCSP, coordinated with federal and tribal partners, identifies production levels for both propagation components and weir management strategies {{for each of the three}} supplemented tributary areas within the Grande Ronde Sub-basin. The three supplemented areas are Catherine Creek, Lostine River, and upper Grande Ronde River. Lookingglass Creek, an extirpated area, will be stocked (smolts and adults) with Catherine Creek origin salmon to initiate natural production in unseeded habitat, and to initiate future harvest opportunities. The current production levels have been incorporated into the U. S. v. Oregon Interim Management Agreement. The purpose of this contract is to integrate Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) efforts with the Lower Snake River Compensation Plan (LSRCP) program utilizing Lookingglass Hatchery as the primary rearing facility. BPA constructed an adult holding and spawning structure on the hatchery grounds; however, maintenance of this infrastructure was discontinued due to funding limitation and transferred to the LSRCP program in 2007. These integrated efforts focus on holding and spawning adults, rearing juveniles, fish health, and monitoring natural production (Redd counts) for Catherine Creek, Lostine River, and <b>Upper</b> Grande Ronde <b>stocks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Difficulties in {{controlling}} settlement densities of hatchery-produced Pecten fumatus larvae on mesh-filled collector bags prompted {{an evaluation of}} two alternative nursery-rearing protocols. In both cases, larvae were initially settled and on-grown on mesh downweller screens in the hatchery. In the first protocol, spat were retained on conventional downweller screens until it {{is large enough to}} be transferred to a field nursery system comprising tiered stacks of mesh screens located in upwelling systems. Mean growth rates were greatest for spat held on the first (most upstream) of eight screens within each stack and exhibited a progressive decline in successive downstream screens at all densities tested. Daily rotation of screen position within stacks overcame differential spat growth and significantly increased overall mean biomass gains. Stocking density per unit surface area of screen is critical in determining growth rate of P. fumatus spat in field upwellers. Irrespective of other growth-limiting factors such as food, the <b>upper</b> limit of <b>stocking</b> rate at which maximum growth rate is maintained is approximately 70 % screen coverage. Although only marginal reduction in growth occurs at stocking rates of up to 100 %, screen stocking rates above 70 % coverage are not recommended because of the problem of death and damage that occurs through inadvertent clamping at higher densities. Maximum growth rates recorded for P. fumatus spat held in a single tier upweller screen coincided with high flow (1 min- 1) to biomass (kg) ratios of 20 to 30 : 1. Reuse of seawater via tiered upweller stacks enabled {{in the case of an}} eight-tiered stack up to a doubling of yield per unit of seawater flow. Optimised production efficiency would appear to coincide with use of about six to eight tiers per stack and daily alternation of screens from the top to bottom locations within the stacks. In the alternative nursery-rearing protocol, P. fumatus were settled on mesh screens using inexpensive nylon curtain material and retained in the hatchery for periods of 1 - 5 weeks post-settlement. The mesh from each screen was removed and was cut into sections with the desired number of spat attached. Each section was placed in a spat collector bag stuffed with conventional coarse plastic netting and was then deployed to the field. Subsequent survival of scallops after 30 days was found to depend on spat size at the time of deployment and upon handling methods used during deployment. The percentage of 500 - 750 Œºm spat (2 - 3 weeks post-settlement) recovered at a size of > 5. 0 mm, suitable for transfer to grow-out facilities, was 25 - 30 % and comparable with that achieved in tiered upweller nurseries. However, screen to collector bag transfer requires less capital outlay and is less labour-intensive than tiered upweller systems. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} widely It {{has been widely}} {{recognized}} the crucial role of soil monitoring in assessing {{the effectiveness of the}} soil measures and agro-environment schemes passed by Regional and local administration in complying the EU‚Äôs Common Agricultural Policy to soil protection. The costs of soil monitoring however are substantial and the reliability of the results often questionable. A reason is that the monitoring activity commonly consists of a network of sampling points which are then spatialized through different inference models. This methodology does not often enable a reliable estimation at the fi eld scale, that is the scale where the measures are foreseen and fi nanced. The organic carbon content of the ploughed layer is an important soil feature, which regulates many soil functions. It is therefore considered in Organic Farming (OF) and contemplated in many agro-environment schemes. The adoption of OF is expected to improve soil organic carbon content (SOC) of the fi elds as a whole. Nevertheless, the improvement might show local variations, because of the interaction between crop management and other factors, for instance, soil erosion. Aim of this work was to check the variations in SOC and stock between and within fi elds where CA was or not applied, using combined soil proximal sensors, namely Œ≥-ray and Vis-NIR spectroscopy. The research work was carried out in four areas in western Sicily (Italy). Two adjacent arable fi elds were surveyed for each area, comparing OF (green and organic manure, 20 - 30 cm rotary tilling, chiselling, or ploughing, crop rotation) lasting from 3 - 10 years, with continuous traditional farming (TF, no rotation, mineral fertilization, 40 - 50 cm ploughing). The lithology was either clayey and calcareous-clayey fl ysch, or clays, silty-clays and marls, but the soils were similar and characterized by toposequences of Calcisols, Regosols, Cambisols, and Vertisols. The Œ≥-radiometric survey was performed by ‚ÄúThe Mole‚Äù sensor, made by ‚ÄúMedusa Systems‚Äù, while the Vis-NIR spectroscopy used Fieldspec 3 Hi-res with the ASD Contact probe for Vis-NIR region (0. 350 - 2. 5 ¬µm). The soils had similar texture, common vertic properties, presence of secondary carbonates, and low organic matter, but gravel content was very variable. The carbon <b>stock</b> (<b>upper</b> 30 cm) of the whole fi elds under OF resulted signifi cantly higher than in TF (on average of 36. 0 versus 33. 2 Mg. ha- 1). In addition, TF fi elds showed very heterogeneous SOC, with very high and very low values, as a consequence of soil erosion, while in OF SOC was much more homogeneous, thus refl ecting both higher organic matter accumulation and lower soil loss from water erosion in similar morphological positions...|$|R
