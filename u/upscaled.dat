In a Bungie Weekly Update, it was {{confirmed that the}} game renders at 1152×640 resolution instead of the usual 1280×720 (HD) resolution that most Xbox 360 games use. This is because Halo 3 uses two frame buffers instead of the usual one, so the lower resolution allowed Bungie to preserve as much of the dynamic range as possible for the game's lighting without adversely affecting the frame rate.

5|$|Harmáček began {{creating}} his new cuts in 2010. At the time, he {{was working}} as an English teacher in Plzeň, Czech Republic, and had no professional experience with film editing. Instead, he taught himself as the project progressed, beginning with Photoshop skills that he had developed in college. To remove the post-1977 changes, Harmáček was required {{to go through the}} film frame-by-frame, correcting colors and rotoscoping. Undoing some shots took only an hour, while others took hundreds. Lightsabers were color-corrected, shots of the Millennium Falcon cockpit were cropped, Boba Fett's voice was changed, and CGI characters and backgrounds were removed. Most of the source material used for Harmy's Despecialized Edition was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray release, while other sequences were <b>upscaled</b> from GOUT. To create the cuts, source material was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray releases, HDTV broadcasts of the 2004 DVDs, GOUT, digital broadcasts of the 1997 Special Edition, the 1993 LaserDiscs, digital transfers of a Spanish 35mm Kodak LPP and 70mm film cels, a 16mm print, and still images of the original matte paintings. Harmáček edited these sources together using programs such as Avisynth and Adobe After Effects.|$|E
5|$|When {{the game}} was renamed and changed platforms, the team chose Luminous Studio as the main game engine. The game's {{real-time}} graphics used 5,000 polygons per-frame, bringing its visual quality close to modern CGI cutscenes and to a level {{that would have been}} impossible for the previous generation's hardware. The game's native resolution was 1920 × 1080 pixels (1080p), with a frame rate of 30 frames per second: this was defined as being native to the game as opposed to <b>upscaled</b> games from the previous generation. For polygon models, the combined number of visible and occluded polygons was estimated as being 5,000,000. This number was approximately five times the amount of equivalent detail from last-generation games. Models used over 600 character bones: 150 bones were created for the face, 300 for the hair, and 150 for the body. A bone-based physical simulation technology was applied so that clothing would react to the body's movements. The polygon count for character hair was estimated as 20,000, the same number used in an entire character in last-generation games. All of these were achievable {{due to the fact that}} the eighth-generation console hardware had approximately sixteen times the amount of storage available in the previous generation.|$|E

25|$|Sony added TV {{output to}} the PSP Slim through Firmware update 3.60. It can output in a {{conventional}} aspect ratio (4:3) or widescreen (16:9), and offers a screensaver if the PSP is inactive for a set amount of time. It is able to output games, videos, and other media. To achieve TV output on the Slim model, Composite, S-Video, Component (YPBPR) and D-Terminal (YPBPR) cables are sold separately by Sony. PSP format games are output as a progressive scan signal, which can be carried only by the Component and D-Terminal cables, and displayed on televisions which support progressive scan. They are also rendered at the 480×272 resolution of the PSP screen, rather than the 720×480 resolution used for output, and are not <b>upscaled,</b> meaning that they are displayed with black windowboxing when viewed to an external display. This can be overcome on some TVs by using built-in zoom functionality. However, the PSP system software, music player and video playback are displayed in full-screen. As of firmware update 5.00, PlayStation (PSone) format software purchased from the PlayStation store is output in full-screen mode and optionally in interlaced format for non-progressive displays. The maximum resolution through TV output is 720×480 pixels and composite video uses NTSC color encoding (no PAL composite signal is available; European TVs must be NTSC compatible {{to be used with}} a PSP via composite). The old PSP-1000 model is not capable of this feature due to a slightly different port. As a result, original PSP accessories (using the connector) will not work with the Slim and the Slim's accessories will not work with the original PSP. Sony released {{a new version of the}} remote control accessory designed for the Slim as a result. The PSP Slim can still use 3.5mm headphones, like the old PSP-1000. The Serial Port is not available on the PSP-E1000, thus it can't have TV-output and remote controls connected.|$|E

40|$|The unfortunate case of {{hydrocarbon}} reservoirs being {{often too}} large {{and filled with}} uncertain details in a large range of scales has been {{the main reason for}} developments of <b>upscaling</b> methods to overcome computational expenses. In this field lots of approaches have been suggested, amongst which the wavelets application has come to our attention. The wavelets have a mathematically multiscalar nature which is a desirable property for the reservoir <b>upscaling</b> purposes. While such a property has been previously used in permeability <b>upscaling,</b> a more recent approach uses the wavelets in an operator-coarsening- based <b>upscaling</b> approach. We are interested in enhancing the efficiency in implementation of the second approach. the performance of an wavelet-based operator coarsening is compared with several other <b>upscaling</b> methods such as the group renormalization, the pressure solver and local-global <b>upscaling</b> methods. An issue with <b>upscaling,</b> indifferent to the choice of the method, is encountered while the saturation is obtained at coarse scale. Due to the scale discrepancy the saturation profiles are too much averaged out, leading to unreliable production curves. An idea is to downscale the results of <b>upscaling</b> (that is to keep the computational benefit of the pressure equation <b>upscaling)</b> and solve the saturation at the original un-upscaled scale. For the saturation efficient solution on this scale, streamline method can then be used. Our contribution here is to develop a computationally advantageous downscaling procedure that saves considerable time compared to the original proposed scheme in the literature. This is achieved by designing basis functions similar to multiscale methods used to obtain a velocity distribution. Application of our upscaling-downscaling method on EOR processes and also comparing it with non-uniform quadtree gridding will be further subjects of this study. Imperial Users onl...|$|R
40|$|This review covers, in a {{comprehensive}} manner, the approaches available in the literature to <b>upscale</b> soil water processes and hydraulic parameters in the vadose zone. We distinguish two categories of <b>upscaling</b> methods: forward approaches requiring information about the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters at a small scale, and inverse modeling approaches requiring information about the spatial and temporal variation of state variables at various scales, including so-called "soft data". Geostatistical and scaling approaches are crucial to <b>upscale</b> soil water processes and to derive large-scale effective fluxes and parameters from small-scale information. <b>Upscaling</b> approaches include stochastic perturbation methods, the scaleway approach, the stream-tube approach, the aggregation concept, inverse modeling approaches, and data fusion. With all <b>upscaling</b> methods, the estimated effective parameters depend {{not only on the}} properties of the heterogeneous flow field but also on boundary conditions. The use of the Richards equation at the field and watershed scale is based more on pragmatism than on a sound physical basis. There are practically no data sets presently available that provide sufficient information to extensively validate existing <b>upscaling</b> approaches. Use of numerical case studies has therefore been most common. More recently and still under development, hydrogeophysical methods combined with ground-based remote sensing techniques promise significant contributions toward providing high-quality data sets.

We consider <b>upscaling</b> on the field-scale, investigate the balance of forces during the water-ooding of a reservoir, and use this to asses the applicability of different <b>upscaling</b> methods, and in particular steady- state methods. Two novel <b>upscaling</b> methods based on the steady-state assumption are suggested, and a comparison study is performed between different methods through realistic field-scale simulations. Established two-phase <b>upscaling</b> techniques are also extended to include polymer properties. As an alternative to <b>upscaling,</b> we also consider the application of a multiscale method to run polymer flooding simulations more efficiently. Using the developed solver, we demonstrate that we are able to obtain fast and accurate solutions on complex grids, using realistic and highly non-linear ow physics. Considering another aspect of polymer modeling, we address a known issue with the mathematical model of an import physical effect of polymer flooding, the velocity enhancement due to inaccessible pore volume.
