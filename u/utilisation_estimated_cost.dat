40|$|Methods A within-subject {{design was}} used. Participants were 65 {{years and older}} and {{received}} professional community care in five countries. The RUD Lite was administered by trained (research) nurses or self-reports within 4 weeks after the interRAI-HC assessment. Agreement between the interRAI-HC and RUD Lite estimates was assessed using Spearman’s correlation coefficients. We hypothesised that there was strong correlation (Spearman’s ρ[*]>[*] 0. 5) between resource <b>utilisation</b> <b>estimates,</b> <b>costs</b> of care <b>estimates</b> and total societal <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> derived from both instruments. Results Strong correlation was found between RUD Lite and interRAI-HC resource utilisation assessments for eight out of ten resource utilisation items. Total societal costs according to the RUD Lite were statistically significantly lower than according to the interRAI-HC (mean difference €- 804, 95 % CI − 1340; − 269). The correlation between the instruments for total societal costs and all six cost categories was strong. Conclusions The interRAI-HC has good convergent validity {{as compared with the}} RUD-Lite instrument to <b>estimate</b> societal <b>cost</b> of resource utilisation in community dwelling older adults. Since interRAI-HC assessments are part of routine care in many community care organisations and countries already, this finding may increase the feasibility of performing economic evaluations among community dwelling older adults. status: publishe...|$|R

The interRAI-Home Care (interRAI-HC) instrument is commonly used in routine care to assess care and service needs, resource utilisation and health outcomes of community dwelling home care clients. Potentially, the interRAI-HC can also be used to calculate societal costs in economic evaluations. The purpose of this study was to assess the convergent validity of the interRAI-HC instrument in comparison with the RUD Lite instrument for the calculation of societal costs among care-dependent community dwelling older adults.

40|$|Objective: To provide {{estimates}} of the prevalence of selected mental disorders in the Western Cape, based on the consensus achieved by a working group established for this purpose. Method: An expert working group was established to provide technical expertise for the project. Potential risk factors likely to influence local prevalence rates were identified. Annual prevalence rates for adults and for children and adolescents were derived by consensus, informed by a systematic literature review. Prevalence rates were derived for individual disorders and adjusted for comorbidity. Results: The overall prevalence was 25. 0 % for adults and 17. 0 % for children and adolescents. Conclusion: Prevalence rates of child, adolescent and adult mental disorders were derived {{in a short period}} of time and with the use of minimal resources. Although of unknown validity, they are useful for policy development and for planning service <b>utilisation</b> <b>estimates,</b> resource <b>costing</b> and targets for service development for local mental health needs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Resource {{utilisation}} {{and direct}} {{costs associated with}} glaucoma progression in Europe are unknown. As population progressively ages, {{the economic impact of}} the disease will increase. METHODS: From a total of 1655 consecutive cases, the records of 194 patients were selected and stratified by disease severity. Record selection was based on diagnoses of primary open angle glaucoma, glaucoma suspect, ocular hypertension, or normal tension glaucoma; 5 years minimum follow up were required. Glaucoma severity was assessed using a six stage glaucoma staging system based on static threshold visual field parameters. Resource utilisation data were abstracted from the charts and unit costs were applied to <b>estimate</b> direct <b>costs</b> to the payer. Resource <b>utilisation</b> and <b>estimated</b> direct <b>cost</b> of treatment, per person year, were calculated. RESULTS: A statistically significant increasing linear trend (p = 0. 018) in direct cost as disease severity worsened was demonstrated. The direct cost of treatment increased by an estimated 86 for each incremental step ranging from 455 euro per person year for stage 0 to 969 euro per person year for stage 4 disease.

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to report the costs of Chagas disease in Colombia, in terms of vector disease control programmes and the costs of providing care to chronic Chagas disease patients with cardiomyopathy. Methods: Data were collected from Colombia in 2004. A retrospective review of costs for vector control programmes carried out in rural areas included 3, 084 houses surveyed for infestation with triatomine bugs and 3, 305 houses sprayed with insecticide. A total of 63 patient records from 3 different hospitals were selected for a retrospective review of resource use. Consensus methodology with local experts was used to estimate care seeking behaviour and to complement observed data on utilisation. Findings: The mean cost per house per entomological survey was $ 4. 4 (in US $ of 2004), whereas the mean cost of spraying a house with insecticide was $ 27. The main cost driver of spraying was the price of the insecticide, which varied greatly. Treatment of a chronic Chagas disease patient costs between $ 46. 4 and $ 7, 981 per year in Colombia, depending on severity and the level of care used. Combining <b>cost</b> and <b>utilisation</b> <b>estimates</b> the expected <b>cost</b> of treatment per patient-year is $ 1, 028, whereas lifetime costs averaged $ 11, 619 per patient.

Chronic Chagas disease patients have limited access to healthcare, with an estimated 22 % of patients never seeking care. Chagas disease is a preventable condition that affects mostly poor populations living in rural areas. The mean costs of surveying houses for infestation and spraying infested houses were low in comparison to other studies and in line with treatment costs. Care seeking behaviour and the type of insurance affiliation seem to play a role in the facilities and type of care that patients use, thus raising concerns about equitable access to care. Preventing Chagas disease in Colombia would be cost-effective and could contribute to prevent inequalities in health and healthcare...|$|R
