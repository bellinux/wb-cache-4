60|$|It is {{a curious}} reflection, however, {{that in spite of}} all the later {{improvements}} in the fictile art--in spite of wheels and moulds, pastes and glazes, stamps and pigments, and all the rest of it--the most primitive methods of the first potter are still in use in many countries, side by side with the most finished products of modern European skill and industry. I have in my own possession some West Indian calabashes, cut and decorated under my own eye by a Jamaican negro for his personal use, and bought from him by me for the smallest coin there current--calabashes carved round the edge through the rind with a rude string-course, exactly like the common rope pattern of prehistoric pottery. I have seen the same Jamaican negroes kneading their hand-made porous earthenware beside a tropical stream, moulding it on fruits or shaping it inside with a free sweep of the curved hand, and drying it for use in the hot sun, or baking it in a hastily-formed kiln of plastered mud into large coarse jars of prehistoric types, locally known by the quaint West African name of 'yabbas.' Many of these yabbas, if buried in the ground and exposed to damp and frost, till they almost lost the effects of the baking, would be quite indistinguishable, even by the skilled archæologist, from the actual handicraft of the palæolithic potter. The West Indian negroes brought these simple arts with them from their African home, where they have been handed down in unbroken continuity from the very earliest age of fictile industry. New and better methods have slowly grown up everywhere around them, but these simplest, earliest, and easiest plans have survived none the less for the most ordinary domestic uses, and will survive for ages yet, as long as there remain any out-of-the-way places, remote from the main streams of civilised commerce. Thus, while hundreds of thousands of years, in all probability, separate <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>from</b> the ancient days of the first potter, it is yet possible for us to see the first potter's own methods and principles exemplified under our very eyes by people who derive them in unbroken succession from the direct teaching of that long-forgotten prehistoric savage.|$|E

5000|$|The station began {{adding more}} cartoons, made-for-TV movies, and off-network sitcoms and family dramas {{during the early}} 1980s. Most notably, in 1980, WXNE took over {{production}} of the weekday bowling program Candlepins For Cash, which had just been canceled by CBS affiliate WNAC-TV (channel 7, later WNEV-TV, now WHDH) after seven seasons. With new host Rico Petrocelli, the show moved production from WNAC's studios, in bowling lanes that {{were built in the}} basement of the facility, to the now-defunct Wal-Lex Lanes in Waltham. After only a few months as host, Petrocelli was ousted in favor of the program's original host when it aired on WNAC, Bob Gamere, who remained on Candlepins until it ended its run on WXNE in 1983. During this time, the station rebranded itself as [...] "Boston 25", as it converted into a true independent. While the station was carried only on cable providers in the Greater Boston market, WXNE held a solid third place among the area's independent stations, behind the longer-established WSBK-TV (channel 38) and WLVI-TV (channel 56), and sixth in the ratings among the market's commercial television stations. The station also implemented two significant advertising campaigns, in a bid to compete with the other independents: Boston turn, New England turn, Everybody turn 25 today/tonight! from 1983 to 1985, followed by You Should See <b>Us</b> <b>Now!</b> <b>from</b> 1985 to 1987 (and was later revived in a rearranged form during the Boston Celtics-ownership era of WFXT, as Watch What Happens..Now!).|$|E

40|$|If you’re a pet lover, {{you might}} want to take a timemachine back to Ancient Egypt where you couldarrange to keep your pet with you – forever! Al-though mummies are synonymous with ancient Egypt, few people realize that the ancient Egyptians also mum-mified animals, {{including}} their pets. Pet mummies are the kind of mummy that reso-nates most closely with <b>us</b> <b>now.</b> <b>From</b> the Old Kingdom (c. 2663 - 2195 BC) onward, Egyptians are pictured in their tombs with their beloved pets, thus ensuring their continued joint existence in the Afterlife. Occasionally the pets would even have their names carved above their image, providing further insurance for their eternal life. This was particularly true of hunting dogs that were im-mortalized with their names such as “Swifter than the Gazelle ” or “Slayer of Oryx”. Devoted pet-lovers buried their animals with them. If the animal died during its owner’s lifetime, it was mummified and kept safely until the owner’s death, perhaps even in the tomb that was begun quite early in a person’s life. If the animal died after its owner’s demise, it could be mummified and placed in the tomb with its master, or in the courtyard just outside, {{as was the case with}} a pet monkey excavated outside a tomb in Thebes or a horse associated with the family of Senenmut, the architect of the magnificent funerary temple of Queen Hatshepsut built at Deir el-Bahari. Some pets, like hu-mans, enjoyed splendid burials, complete with elaborate coffins and food offerings. Pets were only one of several kinds of animal mummies, which actually far outnumber human mum-mies. Mummification was carried out in order to pre-serve the body for eternity so that the soul (ka and ba) could inhabit it in the Afterlife. A large range of animal species were mummified, including cattle, baboons, rams...|$|E

60|$|The gospel seed {{which the}} apostle sowed in those rich, luxurious, clever, learned, Romans, {{was like the}} seed which fell on thorny ground; and the cares and pleasures of this life, and the deceitfulness or riches, sprang up, and choked the word, and it {{remained}} unfruitful. But the gospel seed which was sown among our poor, wild, simple, ignorant forefathers, was the seed which fell on an honest and good heart, and took root, and brought forth fruit, some thirty, some fifty, and some one hundred fold. Epiphany came late to us--not for three hundred years after our Lord's birth: but, when it came, the light which it brought remained with us, and lights <b>us</b> even <b>now</b> <b>from</b> our cradle to our grave: and so again was fulfilled the Scripture, which says, that God chooses the weak things of this world to confound the strong; the foolish to confound the wise; yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought the things which are, that no flesh should glory in his presence.|$|R

But the instinctive doctrine {{that there is something}} holy and mystic in sex, a doctrine which many of <b>us</b> <b>now</b> easily dissociate <b>from</b> any priestly ceremony, but which in those days seemed to all who felt it to need a ritual affirmation, could not be thrown on the scrap-heap with the sale of Indulgences and the like; and so the Reformation left marriage where it was: a curious mixture of commercial sex slavery, early Christian sex abhorrence, and later Christian sex sanctification.|$|R
25|$|The {{portion of}} what is <b>now</b> <b>US</b> 29 <b>from</b> the North Carolina state line to Warrenton was named the Seminole Trail {{by an act of}} the Virginia General Assembly on February 16, 1928.
