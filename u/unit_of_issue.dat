It is issued {{in accordance with the}} Federal Information Resources Management Regulation (FIRMR), Subpart 201 - 9. 1. This Handbook sets forth an alpha-functional index of NASA-prefixed forms by title, identifying number, and <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue.</b> The automated processing two-letter code (NF) has been substituted for the spelling out of the NASA form-prefix preceding the form number. To indicate a description in lieu of a distinct title, the entire reference under the Form Title/Description column has been enclosed in parentheses. A list of current forms, shown by number and page, is included for cross-reference and to preclude the ordering of those forms which have been deleted from the system. This Handbook will be updated, as appropriate. NHB 1420. 2 H dated July 1986, is cancelled...|$|E
40|$|An {{inventory}} {{stock record}} is in error {{when the stock}} record is not {{in agreement with the}} physical stock. Such discrepancies may be introduced due to time lags between flow of information and material, pilferage, incorrect <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue,</b> inaccurate physical inventory counts, etc. The primary impact of these errors is that the system fails to order when it should, resulting in "warehouse denials," i. e., the stock records show a balance sufficient to issue a given material release order, but for which insufficient units of stock can physically be found. The object {{of this paper is to}} select the proper frequency and depth of inventory counts, together with modifications to a given stocking policy, so as to minimize the total cost per unit time, subject to the likelihood of a warehouse denial between inventory counts being below a prescribed level. The goal has been to obtain results easily implementable and leads to formulae comparable to those of the classical economic lot-size models. A numerical example is included to illustrate the procedure. ...|$|E
