5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure.

30|$|The {{dominant}} {{movement in}} this area was <b>uplift,</b> and the <b>uplift</b> area {{was surrounded by a}} subsidence area. Conspicuous <b>uplift</b> of more than 10  mm was observed in an area 50 to 80  m long in the E-W direction and 25 to 40  m long in the N-S direction. In this conspicuous <b>uplift</b> area, it appears that two elliptical <b>uplift</b> areas were superimposed. The eastern elliptical <b>uplift</b> area corresponds to the conspicuous <b>uplift</b> area observed by Onishi et al. (2009), and its maximum <b>uplift</b> reached about 19  mm, which is approximately 1 / 20 of the <b>uplift</b> amount observed by Onishi et al. (2009). The western elliptical <b>uplift</b> has not been observed in the past. However, it had a maximum <b>uplift</b> that reached approximately 26  mm during the half-year observation period in 2012. In contrast, subsidence areas were observed in and around the <b>uplift</b> area mentioned above. The subsidence in these areas reached 8 and 14  mm, and such trends had not been observed in the past. The subsidence area that reached 14  mm corresponds to mud vent B (Figure  2). Near the active mud vent C (Figure  2), <b>uplift</b> was observed instead of subsidence.|$|R

30|$|Examples of {{temporal}} changes in vertical surface displacement, with locations in Fig.  3 b 1, {{are shown in}} Fig.  4. The time series data of vertical displacement shows a decaying <b>uplift</b> velocity over time. The higher <b>uplift</b> velocity area was evident between April 2011 and December 2012. However, the <b>uplift</b> velocity of the Kanto Plain became uniform with time. The <b>uplift</b> velocity south of Tokyo was faster initially and then decreased gradually (Fig. 3 b 1 and b 2).

40|$|<b>Uplifted</b> Neogene marine sediments and Quaternary fluvial {{terraces}} in the Mut Basin, southern Turkey, reveal a detailed history of surface <b>uplift</b> {{of the southern}} margin of the Central Anatolian plateau from the Late Miocene to the present. New surface exposure ages (10 Be, 26 Al and 21 Ne) of gravels above fluvial strath terraces located between 28 and 135 m above the modern Göksu River in the Mut Basin yield ages ranging from ca. 25 to 130 ka, or an average incision rate of 0. 52 to 0. 67 mm/yr. Published biostratigraphic data together with new interpretations of the fossil assemblages from <b>uplifted</b> marine sediments reveal average <b>uplift</b> rates of 0. 25 to 0. 37 mm/yr since Late Miocene time (starting between 8 and 5. 45 Ma), and 0. 72 to 0. 74 mm/yr after 1. 62 to 1. 66 Ma. Together with the terrace ages, the data imply 0. 6 to 0. 7 mm/yr surface <b>uplift</b> rates from 1. 6 Ma to the present. The difference between the post-Late Miocene and post- 1. 6 Ma surface <b>uplift</b> rates can be reconciled by increasing <b>uplift</b> rates through time (though they have been relatively steady since 1. 6 Ma), or by multi-phased <b>uplift</b> with slow <b>uplift</b> or subsidence in between. Longitudinal profiles of rivers in the upper catchment of the Mut-Ermenek Basin show no apparent lithologic or fault control on knickpoints that occur at 1. 2 to 1. 5 km elevation, implying a transient response {{to a change in}} <b>uplift</b> rates. Projections of graded upper relict channel segments to the modern outlet, together with constraints from <b>uplifted</b> marine sediments show that a slower incision/uplift rate of ca. 0. 1 mm/yr preceded the 0. 7 mm/yr <b>uplift</b> rate. The river morphology and profile projections therefore suggest that the southern margin of the plateau was characterized by multi-phased <b>uplift,</b> rather than by steadily increasing <b>uplift</b> rates. Multi-phased <b>uplift</b> can be explained by surface <b>uplift</b> above a slab break-off and possibly also the arrival of the Eratosthenes Seamount at the collision zone south of Cyprus...|$|R
5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also {{jammed the}} {{existing}} subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate. This terminated the Laramide orogeny {{that had been}} <b>uplifting</b> the Rocky Mountains, and triggered the ignimbrite sweep, a wave of large-volume silicic magmatism that swept over much of western North America between 50 and 20 Ma.

5|$|In 2016, Cassini {{found the}} first {{evidence}} of fluid-filled channels on Titan, {{in a series of}} deep, steep-sided canyons flowing into Ligeia Mare. This network of canyons, dubbed Vid Flumina, range in depth from 240 to 570m and have sides as steep as 40°. They are believed to have formed either by crustal <b>uplifting,</b> like Earth's Grand Canyon, or a lowering of sea level, or perhaps a combination of the two. The depth of erosion suggests that liquid flows in this part of Titan are long-term features that persist for thousands of years.|$|E

30|$|Kitamura et al. (2014, 2015) {{investigated}} the faunal compositions and 14 C ages of emergent sessile assemblages at five sites between the Nabeta and Kisami coasts (Fig.  1). Of these sites, the assemblages at the “large cave” on the Kisami coast, west of Shimoda, provided a complete history of coseismic <b>uplift.</b> The assemblages occur continuously between 0.14 and 3.40  m amsl and consist of intertidal barnacles, bivalves, and worm tubes (Fig.  2). Based on the faunal compositions and 14 C {{ages of the}} assemblages in this cave, Kitamura et al. (2015) identified four coseismic <b>uplift</b> events at 1256 – 950 BC (<b>uplift</b> 1), AD 1000 – 1270 (<b>uplift</b> 2), AD 1430 – 1660 (<b>uplift</b> 3), and AD 1506 – 1815 (<b>uplift</b> 4). Based on a mean inter-seismic subsidence rate of 0.6  mm/year and <b>uplift</b> of 0.1  m resulting from the AD 1974 Off-Izu Peninsula earthquake, the estimated amounts of vertical <b>uplift</b> during <b>uplifts</b> 1 – 4 are 1.67 – 2.97, 0.01 – 0.67, 0.72 – 1.04, and 0.76 – 0.94  m, respectively.

50|$|Mälaren, {{the third-largest}} lake in Sweden, {{is an example}} of deglacial <b>uplift.</b> It was once a bay on which {{seagoing}} vessels were once able to sail far into the country's interior, but it ultimately became a lake.

For 2,000 years as the ice was unloaded, <b>uplift</b> proceeded at about 7.5 cm/year. Once deglaciation was complete, <b>uplift</b> slowed to about 2.5 cm annually, and it decreased exponentially after that.

5|$|In the early-to-mid- Mesozoic {{the western}} edge of the North American {{continent}} was pushed against the oceanic plate under the Pacific Ocean, creating a subduction zone. A subduction zone is a type of contact between different crustal plates where heavier crust slides below lighter crust. Erupting volcanoes and <b>uplifting</b> mountains were created as a result, and the coastline was pushed to the west. The Sierran Arc started to form to the northwest from heat and pressure generated from subduction, and compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop.|$|E
5|$|Most World War I war {{designers}} {{attempted to}} produce memorials that were, as cultural historian Jay Winter describes, noble, <b>uplifting,</b> tragic and endurably sad. There were various architectural styles used on memorials, {{but most were}} essentially conservative in nature, typically embracing well established styles such as classicism and embracing mainstream Christian symbolism. This conservatism in part resulted from the age and background of the committees that were commissioning the memorials, and also from a sense that established architectural styles, rather a potentially more transitory but fashionable style, would be more enduring and appropriate.|$|E
5|$|The Upper Klamath Basin, {{defined by}} the {{drainage}} area of the Klamath River above Iron Gate Dam, is a unique transitional area between the Cascade Range {{to the west and}} the Basin and Range Province of the northern Great Basin to the southeast. This region extends from the southern Lower Klamath Lake area into the Lost River and Upper Klamath Lake basins. Crustal stretching and block faulting created a topography with characteristics similar to both regions.

40|$|The {{island of}} Timor, SE Asia {{is the result}} of Arc-continent {{collision}} of the Banda Arc with the Australian Continental margin. Shortening of the Australian plate strata leads to thickening of the crust. Assuming isostasy, this should cause <b>uplift.</b> We hypothesize that the <b>uplift</b> of Timor {{can be explained by the}} built-up of a fold-and-thrust belt. During this built up sedimentation of basins which structurally lie on top of this fold-and-thrust belt, was taking place. These syn-orogenic basins, known as the Viqueque formation, are passive recorders of the <b>uplift</b> history. We reconstruct the <b>uplift</b> history by building an age model for the Viqueque formation and using occurrences of depth markers (benthic foraminifera). Combining the age model with depth differences allows us to reconstruct the <b>uplift</b> history. Timor has experienced <b>uplift</b> in two phases: a phase with almost no significant <b>uplift</b> and generally very low <b>uplift</b> rates during the deposition of the lower part of the Viqueque formation, followed by a phase of rapid <b>uplift,</b> up to ~ 3 mm/yr. The fold-and-thrust belt has been thickened by an average thickening factor of 3. 3. If we assume Airy-type isostasy, and that thickening starts around the first deposition of Viqueque strata, we find a theoretical <b>uplift</b> rate of around ~ 0. 4 mm/yr. Homogeneous thickening of the fold-and-thrust belt alone might be enough to explain the low <b>uplift</b> rates in the lower part of the Viqueque formation. But it is not enough to explain the phase of rapid <b>uplift.</b> Another process is likely the cause for the observed <b>uplift.</b> Activation of the Wetar thrust might explain the <b>uplift,</b> but this is poorly constraint. Slab detachment is unlikely the cause because there is no evidence that the slab has broken off. Timor’s position in the Banda-Arc Australia collision zone makes delamination the most likely process. But further research is needed to strengthen this hypothesis...|$|R
