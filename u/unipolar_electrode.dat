For cathodal currents the virtual anode produces a hyperpolarization that decreases over time. For long duration pulses the current-voltage curve is non-linear, with very small hyperpolarization compared to depolarization. For short pulses, the hyperpolarization is more prominent.

METHODS: Six New Zealand female rabbits (2 - 3 kg) were placed on mechanical ventilation. Then, a laparotomy was performed {{in order to identify}} the motor points in each hemidiaphragm, followed by the implantation of the electrodes for diaphragmatic stimulation. We tested two types of electrodes according to the conduction of electrical stimulation: unipolar and bipolar. The electrodes were placed on different occasions in the same animals and tested with current intensities of 20, 26 and 32 mA. Each current intensity was repeated three times for 10 respiratory cycles with 1 minute interval between each cycle, and 5 minutes for new current intensity.

Our aim was to explore the mechanism of long-duration VF maintenance with 3 -D electrical mapping. We recorded 10 min of electrically induced VF in the left ventricular anterior free wall of six 10 -kg, open-chest dogs using a 3 -D transmural <b>unipolar</b> <b>electrode</b> matrix (9 × 9 × 6, 2 -mm spacing) that allowed us to map intramural activation sequences. At 2. 5 ± 1. 8 min of VF, although the body surface ECG continued to exhibit a disorganized VF pattern, intramurally a more organized, synchronous activation pattern was first observed [locally synchronized VF (LSVF) ]. This pattern occurred one or more times in all dogs and was present 33. 4 ± 31. 4 % of the time during 5 – 10 min of VF. As opposed to the preceding changing complex activation sequences of VF, during LSVF, wavefronts were large and highly repeatable near the endocardium, first exciting the endocardium almost simultaneously and then rapidly spreading toward the epicardium with different levels of conduction block en route. During LSVF, PF activations always preceded working myocardium activations near the endocardium. In conclusion, long-duration VF in dogs frequently becomes highly organized in the subendocardium, with activation fronts arising in this region and passing intramurally toward the epicardium, even though the surface ECG continues to exhibit a disorganized pattern.

40|$|Abstract—It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that ventricular fibrillation (VF) is driven by sustained reentry. However, mapping studies have not detected such “mother rotors ” in large mammalian hearts. We mapped VF from three 2112 <b>unipolar</b> <b>electrode</b> arrays in 6 pigs. Two of the arrays were {{adjacent to each other}} on the left-ventricular epicardium. Electrode spacing was 2 mm. The third array consisted of 21 needles (0. 5 -mm diameter, 12 electrodes, 1 -mm spacing) inserted in a row (2 -mm spacing) between the epicardial arrays. A total of 88 5 -second VF epochs were analyzed with automatic reentry detection algorithms. Although intramural reentry was sporadically present (29 total occurrences), it was always short-lived with a mean life span of 12757 ms. However, in 3 of the 6 animals, sustained epicardial reentry (ie, reentry persisting {{for more than a few}} cycles) was consistently present, often lasting for several seconds. For each epoch, we computed indices characterizing (1) the relative duration of reentry on the two epicardial arrays (R), (2) the flow of wavefronts between epicardial arrays (W), and (3) the relative activation rates of the two epicardial arrays (F). R did not correlate with either W or F indicating that rotor-containing regions did not produce a net outflow of wavefronts and were not faster than neighboring regions. Thus, sustained epicardial, but not intramural, rotors were consistently present in some large animal hearts during VF. However, we found no evidence that these rotors were responsible for sustaining VF through the mechanisms outlined in the mother rotor hypothesis. (Circ Res. 2003; 92 : 539 - 545.)

To verify such model predictions experimentally, an optical technique using a fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye was used to map the spatial distribution of Vm around a 150 -microns-radius extracellular <b>unipolar</b> <b>electrode.</b> An S 1 -S 2 stimulation protocol was used, and vm was measured during an S 2 pulse having an intensity equal to 10 x the cathodal diastolic threshold of excitation. The recordings were obtained on the endocardial surface of bullfrog atrium in directions parallel and perpendicular to the cardiac fibers. In the longitudinal fiber direction, the membrane depolarized for cathodal pulses (and hyperpolarized for anodal pulses) but only in a region within 445 +/- 112 microns (and 616 +/- 78 microns for anodal pulses) {{from the center of the}} electrode (n = 9). Outside this region, vm reversed polarity and reached a local maximum at 922 +/- 136 microns (and 988 +/- 117 microns for anodal pulses) (n = 9). Beyond this point vm decayed to zero over a distance of 1. 5 - 2 mm. In the transverse fiber direction, the membrane depolarized for cathodal pulses (and hyperpolarized for anodal pulses) at all distances from the electrode. The amplitude of the response decreased with distance from the electrode with an exponential decay constant of 343 +/- 110 microns for cathodal pulses and 253 +/- 91 microns for anodal pulses (n = 7). The results were qualitatively similar in both fiber directions when the atrium was bathed in a solution containing ionic channel blockers.

40|$|The present {{clinical}} study examined anatomical and physiological {{factors that influence}} an interference voltage at the input of an implanted pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in a low-frequency electromagnetic field (EMF). "Worst case" conditions were sought that could interfere with proper function of the implanted device and thus endanger the patient with the implant. This investigation was carried out with 15 subjects in a defined 60 Hz electromagnetic field. The interference voltage was recorded using a bipolar {{as well as a}} <b>unipolar</b> <b>electrode</b> configuration; the electrodes were fitted to the chest wall and in an oesophageal catheter positioned immediately adjacent to the right ventricle. The factors examined were: body height, body circumference (in particular chest circumference), body mass index (BMI), respiration, and extent of stomach and cardiac filling. The main findings were that anatomical and physiological factors had a significant effect on the interference voltage, especially with the unipolar system and the 60 Hz electric field. Body circumference and height were the most important anatomical factors. For each 10 cm reduction in thoracic circumference, there was an increase of about 10 percent in interference voltage. With body height, there was an increase in interference voltage of about 11 - 12 % for each 10 cm increase in height. Respiration had the most marked physiological effect, since there was a difference in the interference voltage of over 60 percent between maximal inspiration and maximal expiration. In conclusion, we can state that a combination of the following factors could be regarded as "worst-case": small body circumference, above-average body height, and maximum inspiration. Taken together, these factors can lead to a difference in the interference voltage of over 100 % with a unipolar system in an electrical field. Measurements in a 60 Hz magnetic field showed that this field does contribute to the interference voltage, but this component is only influenced to a limited extent by physiological and anatomical factors. Regardless of anatomical characteristics, our findings demonstrate that with a unipolar system in an electric field, the interference voltage increases as the pacemaker housing is positioned more cranially. It is also clear that the unipolar system is significantly inferior to the bipolar system with regard to its sensitivity to disturbance by a low-frequency EMF. In a magnetic or electric field, a bipolar system only picks up about 5 - 10 % of the noise induced in a unipolar system. The extent of filling of the heart and stomach had no significant effect on the interference voltage in our study. The consequence of our results is that the worst-case-factors outlined above {{must be taken into account}} and documented in future studies for getting comparable results.

The difficult anatomic access is a technical problem for monitoring intestinal activity, therefore most methods are invasive. It results in many problems like the low amplitude of the signal recorded and physiological interferences captured. In order to avoid these troubles, and to estimate the location of the small intestine point whose activity is being recorded, it has been implemented a tripolar concentric ring electrode in bipolar configuration (TCB). This electrode is based on laplacian theory. It was analysed the signals recorded by TCB electrode and contrasted to the internal myoelectric signal and to the signals obtained from the body surface by using two <b>unipolar</b> <b>electrodes.</b> It was carried out a surgical intervention in a Beagle dog to suture a bipolar electrode at the bowel serosa.

Its periodogram revealed a peak near 0. 25 Hz, corresponding to the slow wave frequency (13 to 18 cpm), while it rejected a peak at 0. 4 Hz due to breath interference.

In Langendorff-perfused pig hearts, application of three premature stimuli to nonischemic myocardium between 3 and 5 min after coronary occlusion always resulted in VF {{in the absence}} of drug. In no instance when Org 7797 was present (2 - 10 microM) could VF be induced, although sustained and nonsustained ventricular tachycardias (VTs) could still be initiated in about two thirds of treated hearts. We determined the effects of Org 7797 on wavelength in normal and ischemic myocardium during regular driving at a cycle length of 350 ms. Wavelength, the algebraic product of conduction velocity and refractory period, is considered a useful parameter in assessing efficacy of antiarrhythmic agents in preventing reentrant arrhythmias.

However, Org 7797 prolonged the refractory period at the fastest possible driving rate from 154 to 247 ms and attenuated (5 microM) or prevented (10 microM) shortening of the refractory period during application of subsequent premature stimuli.

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{relation}} between induction of arrhythmias and {{dispersion of repolarization}} is not completely understood. OBJECTIVE The {{purpose of this study}} was to study the {{relation between}} heterogeneity in repolarization and arrhythmogenesis under conditions of selective regional action potential prolongation and shortening. METHODS Pig hearts were perfused in a Langendorff setup. The left anterior descending artery (LAD) was cannulated and perfused. Sotalol (220 mu M) was infused in the aortic cannula, and pinacidil (20 mu M) was infused through the LAD, causing a gradient in repolarization time between the two myocardial regions. Premature stimulation was performed from the LAD region. RESULTS No transmural repolarization gradients developed after infusion of the drugs. High-density epicardial activation/repolarization mapping (176 <b>unipolar</b> <b>electrodes,</b> 2 -mm interelectrode spacing) revealed a maximum repolarization gradient of approximately 120 ms over 14 mm. The critical parameter for differentiating between the occurrence of reentry and the mere occurrence of a tine of activation block between the two myocardial regions (and no reentry) was not the magnitude of the repolarization gradient but the timing of arrival of the premature activation wave at the distal side of the line of activation block relative to the repolarization time of the premature beat proximal to the line of block. No spontaneous arrhythmias were observed despite the presence of the repolarization gradient. CONCLUSION It is not the repolarization gradient but the restitution characteristics of the tissue with the shorter action potential, in combination with the time of arrival of the premature wavefront at the distal side of the line of block, that determines the occurrence of reentr...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{depth of}} an arrhythmic focus {{is a major}} {{determinant}} of ablation procedural outcome. This study examined the relationship between the morphology of unipolar potentials and the depth and horizontal distance to activation foci. MethodsUnipolar left ventricular epicardial mapping was performed in 7 open-chest dogs, using silicon sheets with 12 <b>unipolar</b> <b>electrodes</b> 1 mm apart, during bipolar pacing from an octopolar plunge electrode with 1 -mm interelectrode spacing. The morphology of the unipolar electrograms was classified as QS, rS, qrS, qRS, rsr’S, or rsR’S. ResultsA QS complex was recorded immediately above a subepicardial or mid-myocardial pacing site. An rS complex was recorded away from a subepicardial pacing site. A positive wave originating from a down sloping deflection (R-in-QR) such as r wave in qrS, R wave in qRS, r′ wave in rsr’S or R′ wave in rsR’S complexes was observed when the recording was above a deep myocardial pacing site or away from a mid-myocardial pacing site. The amplitude of negative wave immediately before R-in-QR (Q-in-QR) was inversely correlated with the horizontal (R=− 0. 40; P< 0. 0001) and linear (R=− 0. 22; P= 0. 0006) distance to the pacing site, and the amplitude of R-in-QR was positively correlated with the horizontal (R= 0. 25; P= 0. 0001) and linear (R= 0. 29; P< 0. 0001) distance to the pacing site. The amplitude of the initial r wave was not correlated with the depth or horizontal and linear distance to the pacing site. ConclusionThe morphology of unipolar electrograms predicted the horizontal distance and the depth of nearby foci of activation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} distant {{potentials}} on local epicardial unipolar electrograms were examined utilizing {{a model that}} enabled both ventricles to be paced independently in five dogs. The right ventricular isolation procedure electrically isolates the right from the left ventricle. Right ventricular electrograms were separated into their local (right ventricular) and distant (left ventricular) components by altering the left-right ventricular pacing interval. Waveform configuration, peak to peak amplitude, magnitude of the slope and timing of the fastest downstroke were carefully evaluated at each electrode site, both with and without the presence of distant left ventricular potentials. Except for {{the timing of the}} fastest downstroke, all of these variables were significantly altered by distant potentials. Although the slope of the fastest downstroke was significantly affected by distant potentials, it remained a sensitive indicator of local versus distant activation. All electrograms of local right ventricular activation had a slope magnitude > 2. 5 mV/ 2 ms whereas none of the right ventricular electrograms containing only distant left ventricular activity had a magnitude > 2. 5 mV/ 2 ms. Computergenerated electrograms were calculated by digitally summing the recorded local right and distant left ventricular components. The simulated electrograms correlated well with the recorded electrograms during synchronous ventricular pacing. Thus, the configuration, amplitude and slope of <b>unipolar</b> <b>electrodes</b> were profoundly influenced by distant potentials. The timing of the fastest downstroke is largely independent of the effect of distant potentials and most closely represents local activation. The magnitude of the slope of the recorded electrogram accurately distinguishes local from distant activation...|$|R
40|$|Background—Little {{is known}} about the effects of heart failure (HF) on the {{defibrillation}} threshold (DFT) and the characteristics of activation during ventricular fibrillation (VF). Methods and Results—HF was induced by rapid right ventricular (RV) pacing for at least 3 weeks in 6 dogs. Another 6 dogs served as controls. Catheter defibrillation electrodes were placed in the RV apex, the superior vena cava, and the great cardiac vein (CV). An active can coupled to the superior vena cava electrode served as the return for the RV and CV electrodes. DFTs were determined before and during HF for a shock through the RV electrode with and without a smaller auxiliary shock through the CV electrode. VF activation patterns were recorded in HF and control animals from 21324 <b>unipolar</b> <b>electrodes</b> spaced 2 mm apart on the ventricular epicardium. Using these recordings, we computed a number of quantitative VF descriptors. DFT was unchanged in the control dogs. DFT energy was increased 79 % and 180 % (with and without auxiliary shock, respectively) in HF compared with control dogs. During but not before HF, DFT energy was significantly lowered (21 %) by addition of the auxiliary shock. The VF descriptors revealed marked VF differences between HF and control dogs. The differences suggest decreased excitability and an increased refractory period during HF. Most, but not all, descriptors indicate that VF was less complex during HF, suggesting that VF complexity is multifactorial and cannot be expressed by a scalar quantity. Conclusions—HF increases the DFT. This is partially reversed by an auxiliary shock. HF markedly changes VF activatio...|$|R
40|$|Alerting stimuli {{that cause}} {{sympathetic}} cutaneous vasomotor alerting responses (“SCVARs”) in the thermoregulatory vascular {{bed of the}} rabbit ear pinna also induce theta (5 – 8 Hz) rhythm in the hippocampal EEG, a marker that the animal is engaged with the environment. The present study determines the relation between SCVARs in the thermoregulatory tail artery vascular bed and hippocampal EEG theta rhythm in Sprague- Dawley rats. A Doppler ultrasonic flow probe chronically implanted {{around the base of}} the tail artery was used to measure SCVARs. <b>Unipolar</b> <b>electrodes</b> were implanted in the hippocampus (CA 1 region) to measure EEG. Six standard non-noxious brief alerting stimuli were administered during continuous recording of tail blood flow and EEG. The SCVAR index was calculated as the percentage fall from pre-alerting blood flow values. After stimuli the SCVAR index for the tail artery blood flow was 84 ± 2 % of the pre-alerting control. In contrast, the same stimuli caused little fall in blood flow within the superior mesenteric bed (SCVAR index= 18 ± 2 %). The proportion of theta power in the total frequency range (0 – 20 Hz) increased significantly after alerting stimuli (46 ± 2 % vs. 29 ± 1 % before stimuli, p< 0. 05). Theta proportion began to increase approximately 0. 5 s after the stimuli and preceded SCVARs by approximately 1 s. The SCVAR index was correlated with the magnitude of the increment in theta power. Our study demonstrates that alerting responses resulting in selective vasoconstriction of the tail vascular bed are associated with hippocampal theta rhythm in conscious rats...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of implanted pacemakers was assessed {{at a special}} pacemaker clinic at intervals of three to six months. Measurements of the basic discharge rate of the pacemaker were made and the waveform was recovered from skin electrodes and displayed on an oscilloscope screen. The impulse was photographed from the screen and subsequent waveform analysis was carried out. Reproducible results were obtained for measurements of peak amplitude and impulse duration provided <b>unipolar</b> <b>electrodes</b> were in use and the patients were studied in the same position. The range of variation of the measurements during the lifetime of different models of normally functioning pacemakers is given. Test measurements taken before failing pacemakers were removed have been correlated with the subsequently established cause of failure and the wave-form analysis test {{has been shown to}} be clinically reliable. The value of the test depended largely upon the type of pacemaker but it correlated well with rate changes in pacemakers designed to slow as battery exhaustion developed. The clinical value of waveform analysis tests is in the diagnosis of exit block, electrode failure, and premature battery exhaustion and in determining the optimum time for pacemaker replace-ments. The indications for replacement of pacemakers at the National Heart Hospital are given. Initial experience with an automatic analyser with three types of pacemaker shows that rapid measurements of the waveform parameters can be achieved with accuracy. Although there is continuing improvement in the reliability of cardiac pacemakers, there is a need for methods of evaluation of implanted systems by simple external measurements. Specific tech-niques and apparatus have been developed for us...|$|R
