METHODS Ninety-six <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers participated <b>in</b> the study. Nonexposed workers (n = 105) were randomly sampled among power plant {{workers in the}} same age range. The examination included a questionnaire on health status, occupational history, smoking, and dietary habits. Blood samples completed the examination. <b>Coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers were classified into low-, middle-, and high-exposure groups based on the benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) air concentrations and were further classified into the categories "topside" and "non-topside," according to their proximity to the ovens. RESULTS: Erythrocyte glutathiane peroxidase activity increased with age (r = 0. 18, P = 0. 061) in power plant workers, whereas plasma glutathione peroxidase activity decreased with age (r = - 0. 18, P = 0. 068) and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity was inversely correlated {{with the number of}} cigarettes per day (r = - 0. 28, P = 0. 08) <b>in</b> <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers.

40|$|Abstract—Carbon Deposits {{are often}} {{occurred}} inside the industrial <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> during coking process. Accumulation of carbon deposits may cause a big issue, which seriously influences the coking operation. The carbon is burning off by injecting fresh air through pipes into <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> {{which is an}} efficient way practically operated in industries.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} <b>in</b> <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers to evaluate the biological consequences of the exposure of these workers, particularly production of potential genotoxic factors. METHODS: 60 <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers and 40 controls were recruited in the same iron and steel works. Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was assessed by job and measurement of 1 -hydroxypyrene (1 OHP) in urine samples. An unscheduled DNA synthesis assay was performed on rat pleural mesothelial cells used as a test system to evaluate {{the effect of the}} workers' filtered urine on the DNA repair capacity of rat cells to determine whether DNA damaging agents are present in the urine of these workers. RESULTS: Urinary concentrations of 1 OHP ranged from 0. 06 to 24. 2 (mean (SD) 2. 1 (3. 6)) mumol/mol creatinine <b>in</b> exposed <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers, and from 0. 01 to 0. 9 in controls (0. 12 (0. 15)). These high concentrations <b>in</b> <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers reflected recent exposure to PAHs and were in agreement with the assessment of exposure by job. No significant difference was found between <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers and controls in the DNA repair level of rat cells treated with urine samples. However, the rat cell repair capacity decreased with increasing 1 OHP concentrations in the exposed population (r = - 0. 28, P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: As high concentrations of 1 OHP were found in the urine of some workers, a more stringent control of exposures to PAHs in the workplace is required.

Optimisation of this {{operation}} {{is of a great}} interest both {{from the point of view}} of current production loss reduction and of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> plant lifetime extension. In this study the deposits originating from different parts of chambers have been characterised by chemical analysis, optical microscopy, XRD, Raman spectroscopy and mercury porosimetry. This investigation has shown that deposits contain two carbonaceous phases: the char from pyrolysed carry over coal particles and the pyrolytic carbon from raw gas cracking. Furthermore, the monitoring method for carbon deposits growth <b>in</b> <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> chamber is presented. The statistical analysis of the visual inspection data has been a useful tool in the evaluation of the rate of deposit growth <b>in</b> individual <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> chambers.

Occupational PAH exposure to the workers was assessed by means of the individual urinary post-shift excretion of 1 -pyrenol (mean +/- S. D. : 5. 41 +/- 6. 06 micromole/mol creatinine). Eleven urinary extracts of workers (35. 5 %) were clearly mutagenic (with at least a doubling of the number of spontaneous revertants), against only two samples in the control group (6. 5 %) (chi 2 -test; chi 2 = 7. 883; P < 0. 01). Moreover, the mean mutagenic activity level corrected for dilution/concentration of the urine was about three times higher <b>in</b> <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers than <b>in</b> matched controls (mean +/- S.

METHODS: 88 <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers from a large steel company in Taiwan were studied in 1995 - 6. Exposure was categorised by work area: topside oven workers and sideoven workers. Liver function profiles including serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), r-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (BIL) were examined in the morning after personal exposure measurements. The MspI polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). RESULTS: Five of 23 (22 %) topside oven workers and seven of 65 (11 %) sideoven workers had the CYP 1 A 1 MspI homozygous variant genotype. With sideoven workers with the combined wild type and heterozygous variant as the reference group in multiple regression models, it was found that topside oven workers with the combined traits had mean AST and ALT activities that were 21 % and 46 % higher (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 4 % to 42 % and 12 % to 91 %, respectively) than the reference group after adjusting for appropriate confounders. Also, topside oven workers with the homozygous variant trait had mean AST, ALT, and GGT activities that were 59 %, 68 %, and 157 % higher (95 % CI 21 % to 109 %, 6 % to 168 %, and 39 % to 374 %, respectively) than the reference group. The prevalence of an abnormal hepatocellular pattern (AST > 37 IU/l or ALT > 39 IU/l) was more common in the topside oven workers with the homozygous variant than in the sideoven workers with the other combined genotypes (adjusted odds ratio 9. 9, 95 % CI 1. 2 to 82. 3) after adjusting for appropriate confounders.

40|$|We {{investigated}} oxidative stress/genotoxic effects levels, immunoglobulin levels, polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) levels exposed <b>in</b> 126 <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers and <b>in</b> 78 control subjects, and evaluated the association between oxidative stress/genotoxic effects levels and immunoglobulin levels. Significant differences were observed in biomarkers, including 1 -hydroxypyrene levels, employment time, percentages of alcohol drinkers, MDA, 8 -OHdG levels, CTL levels and CTM, MN, CA frequency, and IgG, IgA levels between the control and exposed groups. Slightly higher 1 -OHP levels in smoking users were observed. For the dose-response relationship of IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE by 1 -OHP, each one percentage increase in urinary 1 -OHP generates a 0. 109 %, 0. 472 %, 0. 051 %, and 0. 067 % decrease in control group and generates a 0. 312 %, 0. 538 %, 0. 062 %, and 0. 071 % decrease in exposed group, respectively. Except for age, alcohol and smoking status, IgM, and IgE, a significant correlation in urinary 1 -OHP and other biomarkers in the total population was observed. Additionally, a significant negative correlation in genotoxic/oxidative damage biomarkers of MDA, 8 -OH-dG, CTL levels, and immunoglobins of IgG and IgA levels, especially <b>in</b> <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers, was found. These data suggest that oxidative stress/DNA damage induced by PAHs {{may play a role}} in toxic responses for PAHs in immunological functions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring the {{carbonization}} of coal, {{the thermal}} conditions within the supporting <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> walls vary substantially. This {{gives rise to}} a continually developing strain field within the walls which could cause cracks to occur in the refractory materials and, thus, shorten the operating life of the oven. Since a more precise knowledge of the location of high strain regions should help in improving the design of <b>coke</b> <b>ovens,</b> a mathematical study was initiated to identify the conditions under which high strain gradients are induced during carbonization. As such, this paper outlines the construction and application of a mathematical model to evaluate the strain distribution and its development <b>in</b> <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> walls during carbonization. The model includes the influence of all the main thermal and physical properties of silica refractory bricks within a finite element formulation to evaluate the temperature and thermally induced strain distributions in a cross-section of a <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> wall. The thermal strain field for a typical oven design is calculated at a number of stages throughout the carbonization cycle. The model results provide a clear picture {{of the nature of the}} thermal strain distribution and its development, highlighting three areas where the strain conditions in the wall will be most severe...|$|R
40|$|Large, uniform {{sized coke}} is {{desirable}} for blast furnace use. It {{has previously been}} shown that the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> flue temperature <b>in</b> the first few hours of coking is a key determinant of <b>coke</b> size. <b>In</b> this paper, the authors present a new programmed heating approach, which is called pulsed heating,aiming to increase coke mean size at a given average flue temperature. The approach {{takes into account the}} charging sequence <b>in</b> <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> batteries and the authors demonstrate how existing operating practice can be modified in batteries with suitable heating systems to achieve the desired heating programme. A mathematical model of fissure formation provides a prediction of the increase <b>in</b> <b>coke</b> mean size <b>using</b> pulsed heating, compared with standard heating. Pilot scale experiments have also been performed to validate the modelling approach. The results of the modelling indicate that the mean coke size can be increased by several millimetres in some cases, although results from the pilot scale show that pulsed heating increases coke size, but by a smaller amount than that predicted by the model. The potential advantages and limitations of pulsed heating are discussed, as well as opportunities for further investigation of the approach...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech(Environmental Health) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011 <b>Coke</b> <b>ovens</b> {{may occur}} <b>in</b> the aluminium, steel, graphite, electrical, and {{construction}} industries. In the work area coke-oven workers may {{be exposed to}} various chemical compounds. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as human carcinogen, are primary compounds <b>in</b> <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions (COEs) generated in the coking process. <b>Coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers are often exposed to PAHs {{and can lead to}} a variety of human diseases. The primary routes of potential human exposure to <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions are inhalation and dermal contact. Occupational exposure may occur during the production of coke from coal, or while using coke to extract metals from their ores to synthesize calcium carbide, or to manufacture graphite and electrodes. Workers at coking plants and coal tar production plants, as well as the residents surrounding these plants, have a high risk of possible exposure to <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions. It is known that coke production could be carcinogenic to humans (Group- 1) by IARC. There has been sufficient epidemiological evidence suggesting an etiological link between carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) exposure and lung cancer risk among coke-oven workers. Lung cancer among coke-oven workers has been classified as one of the eight prescribed occupational cancers in China, and its incidence rate was about 10 times that of the general population. Therefore, lung cancer of coke-oven workers is still a critical issue in the field of prevention and control of occupational cancers in China. This thesis explores the various exposure levels of workers to PAHs at a steel plant in China. The measurement will focus on the exposure difference of personal sampling among workers in selected job classifications given the job descriptions and the coking process. The Benxi Steel Industry in Liaoning province of China (BXSI) was selected as the research location. Liaoning province is in the North of China and the location of various heavy industries in China. The measurements will be done two separate <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>in</b> Benxi Steel Industry. One new <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> was built <b>in</b> the 90 's last century (<b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> N) and the other older <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> was built <b>in</b> the 1940 's <b>in</b> last century (<b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> O). <b>In</b> this research, the total number of employees that were selected in the sample for both <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> are 64 samples included 54 <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> exposure workers and 10 non-exposure administrative workers working at the plants...|$|R
