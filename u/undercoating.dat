2500|$|Volunteers quickly {{took steps}} to stop the decay. Rotted lines were {{replaced}} and the boat re-secured to the pier, the bilges were pumped dry, electric power and heat were brought on board and a leak in the No. 3 torpedo tube sealed off. The first major renovation completed was stripping, <b>undercoating</b> and repainting the hull to the water line. The job took several months, with a break over the winter, but once completed, the Silversides looked nearly new. Below decks, the boat was cleaned and general restoration got under way. Considerable rewiring was done to bring light to {{all areas of the}} boat, the plumbing underwent investigation for leaks sprung in once-frozen pipes and a crew set about surveying the Fairbanks Morse 38D8 [...] nine-cylinder, , opposed-piston engines. The seven-cylinder auxiliary engine was brought back to life in 1975.|$|E
5000|$|Diisodecyl {{phthalate}} (DIDP), {{used for}} insulation of wires and cables, car <b>undercoating,</b> shoes, carpets, pool liners ...|$|E
50|$|The Amazon's {{bodywork}} {{was constructed}} of phosphate-treated steel (to improve paint adhesion) and with heavy use of <b>undercoating</b> and anti-corrosive oil treatment.|$|E
50|$|Proper care of {{the coat}} is most important. The Finnish Spitz blows coat or loses its <b>undercoat</b> twice a year. It is {{imperative}} that owners brush out the old <b>undercoat</b> so the new coat can grow properly. Although a dog may look fluffy and full, excessive <b>undercoat</b> may be causing serious skin problems.|$|R
50|$|Rakes are {{important}} grooming tools especially for double-coated dogs {{such as the}} Newfoundlands or Siberian Huskies. They are good in removing dead hair from the <b>undercoat.</b> The <b>undercoat</b> rake's teeth are especially designed to penetrate through the overcoat down into the thick <b>undercoat</b> to remove loose hair faster and easier than a standard comb. Rakes {{can also be used}} for untangling and dematting.|$|R
5000|$|A {{hypothetical}} Yuc gene, or York Chocolate <b>undercoat</b> gene, {{results in}} cats with no <b>undercoat.</b> However, the proportional relationship between guard, awn, and down hair production varies greatly between all breeds.|$|R
50|$|Underseal (often called <b>undercoating</b> in the U.S.) is a thick {{resilient}} coating {{applied to}} the underbody or chassis of an automobile to protect against impact damage from small stones, which would rapidly chip ordinary paint, allowing rusting to begin.|$|E
50|$|Stainless {{steel is}} often {{preferred}} for kitchen sinks {{because of its}} ruggedness, durability, heat resistance, and ease of cleaning. In better models, acoustic noise is controlled by applying resilient <b>undercoating</b> to dampen vibrations. The material is also used for cladding of surfaces such as appliances and backsplashes.|$|E
50|$|The Fifth Avenue option also {{included}} illuminated entry, AM/FM stereo with a rear amplifier, power door locks, power 6-way driver's seat, power antenna, remote trunk release, dual side mirrors, full <b>undercoating,</b> passenger vanity mirror, tape stripes, locking wire wheel covers, {{as well as}} a standard 5.2L (318 in³) V8 engine.|$|E
5000|$|Bison is {{the soft}} <b>undercoat</b> of the American Bison. The coat of the bison {{contains}} {{two different types}} of fiber. The main coat is made up of coarse fibers (average 59 micrometers) called guard hairs, and the downy <b>undercoat</b> (average 18.5 micrometers). This <b>undercoat</b> is shed annually and consists of fine, soft fibers which are very warm and protect the animal from harsh winter conditions.|$|R
2500|$|The coat {{consists}} of an outer coat and an <b>undercoat.</b> [...] The outer coat is of medium length, coarse, dense and flat. [...] The <b>undercoat</b> should be present on the neck and thighs. The <b>undercoat</b> must not show through the outer coat. Rottweilers living in hot climates may have acclimatised and may be missing the <b>undercoat.</b> Rottweiler coats tend to be low maintenance, although they experience heavy shedding before their seasons (females) or seasonally (males). According to American Kennel Club breed standards, a Rottweiler's coat is short and straight. A coat that is long or wavy is considered a flaw to the AKC.|$|R
5000|$|Schnauzers have {{a double}} coat. The top or guard coat is wiry, while the <b>undercoat</b> is soft. Stripping removes the <b>undercoat</b> and stimulates the hard top coat to come in fuller. The <b>undercoat</b> coat should be [...] "{{stripped}}" [...] (loose, dead hair is plucked) {{at least twice a}} year. A stripped schnauzer will have a hard wiry coat as described in the breed standard. A shaved pet will lose the hard top coat and only exhibit the soft <b>undercoat.</b> Schnauzers are a type of dog that sheds less often than most dogs, and are also hypoallergenic.|$|R
50|$|First used by {{the ancient}} Romans, green earth has been {{identified}} on wall paintings at Pompeii and Dura-Europos. The Renaissance painter and writer Cennino Cennini claimed that “the ancients never gilded except with this green” {{being used as a}} bole, or <b>undercoating.</b> In the Middle Ages one of its best-known uses was in the underpainting of flesh tones.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, the Water Tower {{was saved}} by the Ag Society volunteers and transported to the Grain Elevator Site. The Ag Society volunteers, local businesses, and a generous {{donation}} by a local philanthropist were important for taking the first steps of restoring the Water Tower. In September 2011 work began, first with the sandblasting and <b>undercoating</b> of the tank.|$|E
50|$|The Type 4's battery {{was located}} under the driver's seat (passenger seat on RHD models). All models {{featured}} ventless driver and front passenger windows, notched on their leading edge to provide draught-free ventilation, no cost metallic paint, radial ply tires, full carpeting, clock, electric rear window demister, flow-through ventilation, <b>undercoating,</b> and a thermostatically controlled auxiliary heating system, specifically, a gasoline-operated heater model BA4 by Eberspächer, fired by a glow plug accessible from a hidden rear window deck plate.|$|E
5000|$|Schipperkes can [...] "blow" [...] {{their coats}} {{up to several}} times a year, and usually females more {{frequently}} than males. When this happens, they lose their <b>undercoat.</b> Owners typically find warm baths helpful during this time to remove the <b>undercoat,</b> rather than getting fur all over the home. Blowing their <b>undercoat</b> can last several days or weeks, and {{can take up to}} 2-3 months for Schipperkes to grow back.|$|R
50|$|The Groenendael has a thick, double coat. The texture {{should be}} hard and dense, never woolly, silky, frizzy, fine, or wiry. The <b>undercoat</b> should be thick and profuse. In {{conformation}} shows, dogs without an <b>undercoat</b> are heavily penalized.|$|R
50|$|Single-coated: Lacking an <b>undercoat.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Chassis {{dynamometer}} {{information from}} well documented stock examples reinforces that estimate. Similarly, {{this level of}} acceleration performance is on par {{with that of a}} production line stock, 2013+ V6/ speed manual transmission Accord (278 SAE Net HP), which shares a similar curb weight. It should be noted that a Holman and Moody specially prepared [...] "stripper", which carried no sound deadener, <b>undercoating,</b> or any optional factory equipment, was used as the introductory press car in 1968.|$|E
5000|$|Berra {{spent the}} 1980s {{primarily}} painting Northern New Mexico en plein air. He {{was influenced by}} the Macchiaioli painters of 19th century Italy, precursors to the French practitioners of Impressionism, and he experimented with techniques to achieve their effects. One technique was that of painting on a board shellacked with an orange base. The <b>undercoating</b> generally warms the painting, showing through where oil paint is applied sparingly. He also placed [...] "complementary hues side by side for maximum visual vibration." ...|$|E
50|$|The coat {{is short}} with no <b>undercoating</b> and {{slightly}} coarse to the touch. The coat comes in all shades of fawn and brindle. The {{acceptance of the}} black coat {{is a point of}} contention among fanciers, as it is allowed by the AKC-FSS, UKC and UPPCC standards, but not by the FCI or FCI standards. White is allowed up to 20 percent and is most commonly found on the chest and feet, and occasionally on a blaze on the muzzle. The breed standard requires black pigmentation and dogs should have a black mask that does not extend above the eyes. The breed is known for its minimal shedding.|$|E
2500|$|Shelties have {{a double}} coat, {{which means that they}} have two layers of fur that make up their coat. The long, rough guard hairs lie on top of a thick, soft <b>undercoat.</b> [...] The guard hairs are water-repellent, while the <b>undercoat</b> {{provides}} relief from both high and low temperatures.|$|R
40|$|In {{the pursuit}} for 355 nm high laser {{resistant}} dielectric coatings, layer-pair number of 10 and 15 LaF 3 /AlF 3 high reflectors {{with and without}} SiO 2 <b>undercoat</b> were prepared on BK 7 substrates. The results indicate considerable increase in 355 nm laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) for samples with <b>undercoat.</b> The samples were analyzed in Normalized Electric Field Intensity distribution, total stress, damage depth and damage morphology, revealing that SiO 2 <b>undercoat</b> benefits fluoride coatings by shielding substrate defects and reducing coating defects.

5000|$|Sculptors {{often use}} a high amount of {{detail in the}} figures, and {{painting}} may require the finest brushes, as fine as 00000 (5/0). Most painters will use a range of different brush sizes; 1, 00, and 0000 is a likely minimum set. Good quality brushes like kolinsky sable brushes that take a fine point are preferred, although hog or synthetic brushes are better for [...] "rough" [...] work: <b>undercoating</b> and dry brushing. An airbrush is also a commonly used tool. Airbrushing facilitates leveled painting surfaces and allows for effects like gradients and soft blended edges. Because of the detail work involved, airbrushes with a small tip diameter are considered more useful.|$|E
50|$|In September 1973, the Viva {{range was}} divided, the entry 1256 cc models staying as Vivas, with the 1.8-litre engine an option on the Viva SL with an {{automatic}} transmission. The 1.8- and 2.3-litre models took on more luxurious trim and were rebadged as the Magnum. The whole range of Viva-based cars received safety equipment upgrades at the same time, with power-assisted dual-circuit brakes (with disks in front) being made standard. Safety belts, reclining front seats, two-speed windshield wipers, and <b>undercoating</b> were also made standard across the board. Additionally, the Firenza coupé was given a radical makeover with an aerodynamic nose and beefed up 2.3-litre twin carb engine mated to a ZF five-speed gearbox, turning it into the HP (High Performance) Firenza.|$|E
5000|$|After the fire, he {{took his}} wife, now wheel-chair bound, back home so he {{could take care of}} her and their daughter. His {{drinking}} problems continued due to the constant [...] "distractions" [...] of their presence. After regaining her ability to walk, the wife was neglected even more because her husband thought she lacked [...] "beauty". After the painter had another drunken outburst, the wife committed suicide in the bathroom (either by drowning or slitting her wrists in the tub). In the present day, it is revealed that he went insane and took six body parts of his wife to work on his painting: her skin as the canvas, her blood as the overlay, her bone marrow as the <b>undercoating,</b> a brush made from her hair, her finger for the smearing and her eye as the spectator.|$|E
50|$|When you {{consider}} painting, {{there is usually}} a primer, an <b>undercoat</b> and a topcoat. Similarly in renders {{there may be a}} stipple coat, then an <b>undercoat</b> (sometimes called a base coat) and finally a final coat (sometimes called a topcoat). The difference is that in renders, the final thickness is 15 mm.|$|R
50|$|Coat care {{requires}} line brushing on {{a fairly}} regular basis. The Keeshond typically 'blows' its <b>undercoat</b> {{once a year}} for males, twice a year for females. During this time, the loss of coat is excessive and their guard hairs will lie flat to their back. It usually takes 2 weeks for the 'blow' to complete, in order for new <b>undercoat</b> to begin growing back in. A Keeshond should never be shaved, as their <b>undercoat</b> provides a natural barrier against heat and cold. Keeping their coat in good condition will allow efficient insulation in both hot and cold weather.|$|R
50|$|In {{the show}} ring, the coat should be shown as {{completely}} natural; a brush through the coat is acceptable, but no trimming is allowed, not even of whiskers. However, any excessive <b>undercoat</b> should be removed. Some exhibitors choose to show dogs with excessive <b>undercoat</b> {{to make the}} dog's coat appear more lush. Failing to shed <b>undercoat</b> is considered neglect by some judges who prefer a clean and combed coat. Another exception is the hair under {{the bottom of the}} feet. The hair under the feet as well as the toe nails should be nicely trimmed for show.|$|R

5000|$|She {{spent the}} morning of 12 January evading Japanese patrol planes. In the afternoon, she closed a six-ship convoy; but, as she came to periscope depth for a final check, she was spotted from the air. Three salvos of bombs dropped close aboard, but Seadragon went deep and again made her way eastward—this time to {{investigate}} {{the cause of the}} plane sightings. She surfaced after 18:00. No oil or air leaks were spotted, but her black paint was coming off the entire hull. Red lead <b>undercoating</b> showed from the waterline to the side plating, and, [...] "in spots", on the bow planes and propeller guards. In shallow tropical waters, her original black paint was easily spotted against a light colored background. With red showing, she stood out regardless of the color of the seabed. From then on, Seadragon ran at 140 ft between periscope exposures except in areas known to be patrolled by air, when she went to 200 ft.|$|E
5000|$|This area {{is famous}} for its medieval pottery, which was widely exported. Sherds of it have been found in large {{quantities}} in medieval excavations throughout Ireland and other European countries. These shards are from vessels made and exported as a by-product of the Bordeaux wine trade (Deroeux and Dufournier, 1991). This ware has been found on Irish excavations from the later 12th century but it is most commonly uncovered in 13th-century contexts. They consist of an off-white micaceous fabric with moderate amounts of quartz and sparse inclusions of haematite. They are glazed on the external surface only, with a clear lead glaze. In Saintonge Green wares, the addition of copper filings, or copper oxide to the clear lead glaze, produced a mottled mid-green colouring. Many forms of Saintonge wares were produced, including Saintonge Polychrome, Saintonge Green, and in some cases unglazed wares. Slipped Saintonge is more consistent in colour and appearance than unslipped, having the benefit of an <b>undercoating</b> to regulate the process.|$|E
