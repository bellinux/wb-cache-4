30|$|As for buildings, houses, pipelines, {{main road}} and bridges in the vicinity, shield {{tunneling}} induced movements were strictly controlled below the predefined allowable movements with the auxiliary measures taken, such as grouting {{from the ground}} surface when necessary. Taking the shield <b>under-crossing</b> the viaduct of the Beijing Airport Express as an example (Guo and Li 2014), three dimensional numerical calculations were performed to predict the movements caused by the shield tunneling using the finite element method in advance. Based on the calculations, anchor-piles were used to reinforce the ground before shield <b>under-crossing.</b> During the <b>under-crossing,</b> strict control of the shield operation was executed, and the maximum settlement of the viaduct was < 2  mm of the predefined allowable settlement. The settlement of 2  mm was required by the owner of Beijing Airport Express.

30|$|The above {{criteria}} {{were employed in}} some tunnel close crossing construction projects (Liu et al. 2005) in Shanghai {{as well as some}} projects in Shenzhen, including a double deck tunnel and two running tunnels on Line 1 under crossed by tunnels on Line 2, tunnels on Line 1 under crossed by tunnels on Line 3, and tunnels on Line 2 under crossed by tunnels on Line 4. The Shanghai soft ground is composed of littoral deposits featuring with saturated, flow to soft plastic clay with high compressibility and sensitivity and low strength, long stabilizing time and big settlement after being disturbed. The existing subway tunnels often have already produced some even large settlements on account of the long-term consolidation settlements of underlying soil (Wang and Liu 2001; Ye et al. 2007). In some later projects, more strict {{criteria were}} adopted. The allowed settlement and uplift were both reduced to 5  mm and the demand for tunnel convergence was < 20  mm in projects of Shanghai, embracing tunnels on Line 2 <b>under-crossed</b> by tunnels on Line 4 (Wang et al. 2004; Hu and Huang 2006), tunnels on Line 2 above-crossed by tunnels on Line 8 (Wang and Yu 2006), and others presented by Chen et al. (2009) and Zhu and Huang (2010).|$|R
30|$|The {{relationship}} among important shield tunneling parameters {{and its effects}} on the existing tunnels still remain an issue. Usually the existing tunnel will move toward the excavated space. The existing tunnel will settle in case of <b>under-crossing</b> and rise in case of above-crossing. But this is not always the case. For example, in some <b>under-crossing</b> projects the existing tunnels rise due to adopting the higher earth chamber pressure and the rapid advance rate. The phenomena are also relevant to with the soft ground of Shanghai area for they have not been observed in other cities of China up till now. Further study and efforts are still needed to set up the quantitative relations between shield tunneling parameters and their effects on existing tunnels.|$|E

30|$|In view of {{the above}} merits, the {{staggered}} scheme was widely used in construction of the subway tunnels in China. For example, the staggered crossing scheme was applied to building twin shield tunnels on Shekou Line of Shenzhen subway crossing under the double deck tunnel on Luobao Line, and the first crossing induced settlements of the above tunnel had already tended to be stable before the second crossing (Li and Yuan 2012). In the project of Line 2 tunnels under crossed by Line 4 tunnels of Shanghai subway, the second <b>under-crossing</b> was performed more than 3  months later (Wang et al. 2004; Hu and Huang 2006). In the project of Line 2 tunnels above crossed by Line 8 tunnels of Shanghai subway, the second <b>under-crossing</b> was performed nearly 2  months later (Wang and Yu 2006).|$|E
30|$|Usually {{existing}} tunnels {{settle in}} <b>under-crossing</b> construction and uplift in above-crossing construction. But in Fig.  11 the tunnel movements of 6 out of 12 <b>under-crossing</b> projects are minus movements, which represent uplift. The phenomena {{can be attributed}} to the higher face pressure adopted in the construction and the sensitive soft clay in Shanghai and Hangzhou, which can effectively transmit the pressure onto the existing tunnels, causing uplift of the existing tunnels. The existing tunnel in the No. 19 above-crossing project settled, for the higher grouting pressure in the new tunnels was used to improve the overlying soil of the existing tunnels. In short, it is in the sensitive soft clay of Shanghai and Hangzhou that using face supporting pressure and grouting pressure to actively control movements of the existing tunnels can be realized, especially in case of thinner soil layers between new tunnels and existing tunnels. From Fig.  11, the movements of the existing tunnels are in the ranges of − 6 to + 8  mm except existing tunnels of the Nos. 10 and 20 projects having larger movements of − 29.68 and 11.46  mm respectively, and these two larger movements {{can be attributed to}} excavation diameter more than 10  m of the used shield machines.|$|E

Yang et al. (2009) presented the three dimensional numerical simulation and analysis of Line 10 shield tunnel of Beijing subway crossing under Shaoyaoju station of Line 13. Applications and adjustments of the shield driving parameters together with the monitored performances of Shaoyaoju station were introduced in detail by Li et al. (2009 a). Gao et al. (2009) described 10 shield power cable tunnels close crossing the subway tunnels in service or being built or planed. Mohamad et al. (2010) presented a novel technique of distributed strain sensing, whose measured results have close agreement with the data obtained by using total station units, to examine the performance of an old masonry tunnel during {{the construction of a new}} tunnel beneath it in London. Chen and Li (2011) presented the method of design and regulation of construction parameters of Line 2 shield tunneling below the existing interval tunnels from Kexueguan station to Dajuyuan station on Line 1 of Shenzhen subway. Chen et al. (2011) presented the measures taken for Shanghai subway Line 7 twin running tunnels passing under the two existing operational Line 1 tunnels at the skew angle of 98 ° in the EPB shield launching phase. The measures included ground improvement, movement monitoring of the existing tunnels and in-tunnel grouting. Ground improvement zone extended from the usual 3 – 6  m, and the deep mixing method using cement as a soil stabilizer was adopted. The automatic electrolevel monitoring method was utilized to facilitate the information management. Injecting the two-liquid cement-sodium silicate grout from within the new tunnels was performed to confine further settlement of the operational tunnels. Li and Yuan (2012) reported twin tunnels on Shekou Line of Shenzhen subway were driven by EPB shields <b>under-crossing</b> a double-decked tunnel on Luobao Line, and the performance of the existing tunnel as affected by <b>under-crossing</b> tunnels was monitored and analyzed. Turner and Yap (2011) explored the paradox of commonly used semi-empirical methods for predicting the 3 D tunneling-induced ground movements, and investigated the potential effects of the ground movements on the longitudinal and transverse response on the structural behavior of the existing tunnels, and highlighted the shortcomings of commonly adopted assessment methods which may result in non-conservatism and mask critical issues of existing tunnels, and demonstrated the use of modern computing to do powerful complex analysis to solve the complexities of soil–structure interaction and manage risks associated with tunnel crossings. Wang et al. (2011) described Line 6 twin running tunnels of Guangzhou subway crossing 8.1  m under the existing operational Line 1 Huangsha station tunnel along curved lines with minimum radius of 250  m, and measures taken included detailed investigation and assessment of the station tunnel, overall inspection and replacement of disc cutters as well as the automatic monitoring in the existing tunnel. The induced maximum settlement of the station tunnel was about 1.85  mm, which was far less than the alarm value of 4  mm. Yang et al. (2011) analyzed ground disturbance caused by shield crossing base on an above–below crossing project in Shanghai subway construction using the numerical simulation approach, and formulated a series of measures according to theoretical predictions. Zhang and Guo (2011) analyzed the responses of Line 1 tunnels under crossed by Line 3 tunnels of Shenzhen subway using the 3 D fast lagrangian analysis of continua method. Zhang and Liu (2011) presented the summary on shield tunnels of Zhujiang Xincheng automated people mover system closely <b>under-crossing</b> Line 1 tunnels of Guangzhou subway. Pan (2011) introduced the construction technologies adopted to building twin running tunnels of Line 11 of Shanghai subway <b>under-crossing</b> the two operational subway tunnels of Line 1 at a skew of 30 °, which included selection of shield driving parameters such as earth chamber pressure and advance rate, and the automatic monitoring in the existing tunnels using Electrolevel Beam Sensors. Wang (2011) described the work of injecting the two-liquid cement-sodium silicate grout in existing tunnels on Line 2 of Shanghai subway to confine settlements of Line 2 tunnels caused by constructing Line 11 tunnels. The scheme of using the two-liquid cement-sodium silicate grout to confine settlements and reduce differential settlements of Shanghai subway tunnels in service was put forward (Feng et al. 2011; Xiao and Wang 2011). Zhang et al. (2011) and Zhang and Huang (2014) studied movements of the Shanghai subway Line 4 tunnels caused by the up-line and down-line tunnel on Line 11 crossing under and above respectively, using the 3 D finite element analysis program ABAQUS. Huang et al. (2012) studied the effects of the EPB shield tunneling on the above twin existing operational tunnels of Shanghai subway Line 2 on the background of the Shanghai Bund Passage tunnel project using the centrifuge modeling method together with field measurement. In the centrifugal model tests, the influencing factors such as unloading of the excavation, ground loss and grouting were considered to analyze the longitudinal settlement of the new tunnel and the existing tunnels. Besides, the settlement curves of the existing tunnels during the new shield construction were discussed by means of the monitoring data. Ma et al. (2012) studied the effects of the above-crossing construction of a shield tunnel on existing tunnels using centrifuge modelling method on the background of Shanghai’s typical soft ground layers, and the existing tunnels’ behavior and the ground response were analyzed in terms of settlement, pore pressure and internal forces during and after the construction at different grouting ratios. Centrifuge tests showed grouting can alleviate the heave of the existing tunnel. However, excessive grouting ratio during construction will disturb the surrounding ground and cause more settlement in the long run after the construction. Yuan (2012) gave the monitoring plan, the shield driving control and the in-tunnel loading measures when building Shanghai bund passage tunnel about 1.4  m above the two existing operational Line 2 tunnels of Shanghai subway. The Shanghai bund passage tunnel with the overburden of only 7.9  m at the crossing location was excavated using a 14.27  m-diameter EPB shield. The measured maximum uplifts of the up-line and down-line tunnel were 10.90 and 10.14  mm respectively. Zhu et al. (2012) analyzed three factors influencing the crossing construction in Shanghai: the vertical interval between the existing tunnel and the new tunnel, the projection angel and the synchronous grouting rate, and obtained linear regression equations to show the trends of displacement during the overcrossing and the undercrossing construction projects. Han (2013) introduced the construction technology and measures taken for constructing the Shanghai Expo power cable tunnel passing 9.4 and 3  m under the twin operational Line 4 tunnels of Shanghai subway. The technology centered on selection of the EPB shield driving parameters and backfilling grouting in different crossing stages. Jiang (2013) described the technologies, including obstacle exploration in advance, consolidation of ground between the shield tunnel and the existing subway station, determination of proper shield tunneling parameters and grouting parameters, optimization of the grouting system of the shield machine, and particularly the injecting bentonite into the gap between the excavation and the shield shell before performing the simultaneous backfilling grouting, adopted in constructing twin running runnels of Line 8 2 nd phase project 2.5  m under the existing operational Guloudajie station of Beijing subway Line 2.

Therefore, {{the first step of}} the approach to success even at a higher price, when tunneling adjacent to the existing operational tunnel, is choosing the reasonable construction method together with implementing whatever measures necessary to realize the safe operation of the existing tunnel. In uttermost construction cases of mainland China the shield tunneling method with pressurized face support is required and adopted in view of its many advantages such as the rapidity and industrialization of the construction cycle with possible automation, the possibility to measure and keep under control the principle construction parameters and the guaranteed quality of the finished work using precast segments to line the tunnel. For example, a section of a power cable tunnel <b>under-crossing</b> Line 1 tunnel of Beijing subway was constructed using the shield tunneling method whereas the remaining part was constructed by manual excavation, even if the improved mining method is verified to be suitable for ground conditions of Beijing area. Also the shield tunneling technology offers a high degree of planning certainty in terms of both finance and time compared to the conventional techniques. Moreover, a challenge of the future will be to keep up mobility of people and goods and data, protection of the surroundings and availability of resources. The shield tunneling method offers the technology to meet the challenge both for traffic and utility tunneling.|$|E
40|$|The optimistic {{limit of}} the colored Jones {{polynomial}} and the volume calculation JINSEOK CHO We discuss how to calculate the complex volume of a hyperbolic knot using the optimistic {{limit of the}} colored Jones polynomial. This method {{is based on the}} colored Jones version of Yokota theory. This is ajoint-work with Jun Murakami. Let K be a hyperbolic knot, vol(K) be the hyperbolic volume of K and cs (K) the Chern-Simons invariant of the knot complement S^ 3 K modulo π^ 2. We call vol(K) +i cs (K) the complex volume of K. The {{purpose of this article is}} to survey the method of calculating the complex volume using the optimistic limit of the colored Jones polynomial in [3]. Note that this method relies on Yokota’s theory of the optimistic limit of the Kashaev invariant in [11]. The calculation consists of the following four steps. 1 First step: drawing oriented (1, 1) tangle We fix a diagram D of K. We define sides of D as arcs connecting two adjacent crossing points. For example, Figure l(a) has 10 sides. Now we split a side of D open to make a (1, 1) -tangle diagram. (See Figure 1 (b).) We assume that the diagram satisfies Yokota’s Assumptions 1 - 6 in [11]. This roughly means the diagram has no crossing points that can be reduced trivially. We can always deform any knot diagram to satisfy these assumptions. Let the two open sides be I and J. Assume I and J are in an over-bridge and in an under-bridge respectively. Then extend I and J so that non-boundary endpoints of I and J become the first <b>under-crossing</b> point and the last over-crossing point respectively, as in Figure 1 (b). Assume the two non-boundary endpoints of I and J do not coincide. Yokota proved in [11] that we can always choose I and J with these conditions because, if not, the knot should be the trefoil knot, which is not hyperbolic. Finally, we remove I and J from the tangle diagram and put the result G. We always assume G is oriented by the direction from I to J...|$|E

Adopted EPB shield driving parameters, such as earth chamber pressure, annular filling grouting, and shield {{advance rate}} and cutterhead torque were also detailed. Chen et al. (2014) introduced measures and countermeasures adopted in shield tunneling under the existing operational subway tunnels in Shenzhen. The existing tunnel near the shield launching shaft, a special steel sleeve {{used for the}} launching was fixed at the tunnel portal, and such measures and countermeasures as ground improvement, adjustment of shield driving parameters and information feedback construction were also employed to ensure safety of the <b>under-crossing.</b> Fan (2014) described the schemes for constructing twin Line 3 west extension tunnels of Shenzhen subway, 1.23 and 1.46  m under the two existing operational subway Line 1 tunnels respectively. The adopted technologies were centered on shield driving parameter selection, backfilling grouting and in-tunnel monitoring, and injecting bentonite around the shield. In this project, limiting the speed of trains < 25  km/h during the construction was employed for sake of the public safety. Li et al. (2014) described the shield tunneling technology and measures taken when Line 11 twin running tunnels of Shenzhen subway crossing 1.5  m above Line 1 twin existing operational tunnels. Improving ground above the existing tunnels, elaborate shield driving control together with in-tunnel automatic monitoring helped control the uplift of the existing tunnels within 2  mm and guarantee safety of the subway traffic. Wang et al. (2014) used the 3 D FEM to simulate the excavation process of three crossing forms of the twin new tunnels: first above and then under crossing, two under crossings and two above crossing, based on the actual soil layer of one tunnel overlapping section of Shanghai subway. Reliability of the numerical simulation was verified by the comparison between measured and simulated data. Settlements of the existing tunnels and measures for controlling the settlements were given in the each crossing form. Yun et al. (2014) developed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based monitoring framework using sensor data collected from the existing tunnel while the new tunnel was excavated, which is particularly useful to analyze underdetermined systems due to insufficient sensor data for explicit relations between force and deformation as the system input and output respectively. Zhang et al. (2014) analyzed influence of the two new tunnels construction on the existing twin tunnels for two construction methods of above-crossing and <b>under-crossing,</b> using the commercial program (ABAQUS), and a modified Gaussian equation was proposed to predict ground settlement according to the computation results. Results showed that a secondary disturbance was {{to be caused by}} the shield advance, and greater influences would be exercised on the existing tunnels when the new tunnels were closely spaced. In addition, many other similar shield tunnel close crossing construction projects in mainland China, not reported in literatures or official publications due to various reasons, were realized in demanding conditions not only in respect of inner city environment where space requirements had to be taken into regard but also in respect of safe operations of the neighboring subway tunnels. For instance, in Hangzhou the first shield tunnel crossing project was finished in December 2013, of Hangzhou subway Line 4 tunnel between Guanhe station and Railway East station passing 2.1  m below the twin operational Line 1 tunnels after about 29  m driving from the launching excavation. The Hangzhou subway Line 4 interval tunnel between Qianjianglu station and Jiangjinlu station passing about 1.273  m below Line 1 tunnels was successfully accomplished on April 15, 2014. It is obvious that uttermost publications presented above dealt with only a single case study mainly because of the tribal knowledge of the involved projects. Generalized studies from the many case studies in combination with some undocumented recordings are necessary to improve the shield tunneling in close proximity to the existing operational subway tunnels. Moreover, it is often necessary in practice to take into consideration a set of distinct elements that frequently influence the construction of tunnels near the existing subway tunnels. Then well-targeted graduated response plans are designed to systematically and consistently manage safeties of the projects throughout the whole construction process. Although further studies on some topics do necessitate performing, a common understanding and recognition of the safety control framework has been reached in many aspects of the shield tunneling in close proximity to the existing operational subway tunnels in mainland China. Six key elements of the framework are presented. The conclusions of the elements, on which a consensus can be reached, are generalized from the typical close crossing construction projects in mainland China, while individual differences are illuminated. The purpose of the paper is to give the state-of-the-art review on the key elements of the safety control framework for shield tunneling in close proximity to the operational subway tunnels, so as to provide references for later similar projects.|$|E
3000|$|New shield tunnels {{constructed}} {{in close proximity}} to the existing operational subway tunnels provide challenges of minimizing movements to the operational systems, and many publications focuses on the challenges. It is particularly necessary to mention that the construction of the North East Line (NEL) presented Singapore with its first such challenge. At two locations, near Dhoby Ghaut and Outram Park Stations, this new line passed 3 and < 5  m below the existing operational subway tunnels respectively. Studies were performed to ensure the safe operation of the above existing tunnels. For example, to assess the influences of the tunneling work on the existing tunnels, ten ‘limit states’ were established, with respect to the tunnel structural integrity and track alignment. Shirlaw et al. (2000) described the instrumentation used to check against the ten ‘limit states’, and discussed reporting and assessment of the monitored data. Doran et al. (2000) assessed the total amount of movement that could be tolerated for each limit state after having presented the potential effects of the ten ‘limit states’, five relating to the tunnel structure and trackbed, and five to the subway operation. Osborne et al. (2000) related measures adopted to maintain minimum movements of the existing tunnels, which included a protective pipe roof between the new and the existing tunnels, ground control through the use of an EPB shield machine and extensive on-line monitoring of the ground and the existing tunnels. The first comprehensive study of tunnel and lining response to adjacent tunneling published in the literature was given by Cooper et al. (2002). Among others, Standing and Selman (2001) gave the extensive monitoring within several existing tunnels (District and Circle Line, Bakerloo Line, Shell Center service tunnels Northern Line, Waterloo and City line) mainly in the form of precise leveling, taping and total station surveying of track levels and lining deformations when the Jubilee Line Extension was constructed beneath these existing tunnels. Li and Zeng (2001) studied the influence on one old tunnel, of one new tunnel perpendicularly crossing below the old tunnel, using the 3 D finite element method (FEM), and computation results showed advance force and stability ratio were the main factors for controlling deformation of the old tunnel. Kong (2002) described the requirements to be complied by the engineers in the planning, investigation, design and construction of any development within the Railway Protection Zone in Singapore, and precaution/protective measures commonly adopted in the construction control of selected projects, and the behavior of ground and MRT structures observed by various types of instruments during adjacent construction works. Cooper and Chapman (2002) and Cooper et al. (2002) dealt with the monitoring within the Piccadilly Line tunnels during construction of the Heathrow Express tunnels {{constructed in}} close proximity to the Central Terminal Area Station, Angel Station as well as Old Street Reconstruction, and a description was given of the instruments used, which included electrolevels, precise levels and tape extensometers, and the relative merits of manual methods and remote reading methods were discussed. Mazek et al. (2003) introduced the construction of the Greater Metro Line 2 and El-Azhar road tunnels under an existing sewage tunnel, and a 3 -D model of the multi-crossing tunnel incorporating the effect of grouting was provided to evaluate the usefulness of permeation grouting in reducing deformation around the sewage tunnel when the metro and the road tunnels passed underneath it at different crossing zones. Wang (2003) introduced more than twenty applications of electrolevel beam sensors in the existing tunnels on Lines 1 – 3 of Shanghai subway to ensure safety of the subway traffic. Shao and Zhang (2004) presented the development of movements of Line 2 tunnels under crossed by Line 4 tunnels of Shanghai subway, and pointed out that the peak uplift always appeared behind the shield tail on account of the action of backfilling grouting. Liao et al. (2005) deduced a theoretical formula of earth chamber pressure of the EPB shield based on tunnel loading model and theory of elasticity, and a so-called ‘step control strategy’ was concluded and applied in building Line 4 tunnels crossing under Line 2 tunnels of Shanghai subway, and the maximum displacement of the existing tunnels was controlled within 5  mm. Li and Zhang (2005) described monitoring and analysis of the tunnel deformations when shield tunnels on Line 4 were constructed under Line 2 tunnels near Dongfang Road Station of Shanghai Subway. Chapman et al. (2006) investigated the use of a simple semi-empirical method for predicting the ground displacements caused by grouting operations, and explained the method, and presented the results as applied to the grouting at Heathrow. Examples of the settlement, rotation and distortions predictions of the Piccadilly Line tunnels made using the methods were compared to the actual measurements, which demonstrated that the method has the potential to provide a reasonable first estimate of the likely effects of grouting on the surrounding ground and, in the case at Heathrow, the effects on an adjacent tunnel. Chen et al. (2006) studied the process of longitudinal settlement of an existing tunnel in Shanghai caused by adjacent shield tunneling on top by combining monitoring data with theoretical analysis. They concluded that (1) when the nearby tunneling is more than 10  m away the settlement caused is negligible, and (2) upheaval during the construction deserves special attention as it may account for almost 69  % of the final movement, and (3) the movement process of the existing tunnel can be divided into four phases: settlement in advance, upheaval during the crossing, short-term upheaval after the crossing, and long-term settlement. Moss and Bowers (2006) presented the running tunnels of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link high-speed railway passing beneath an underground station and under six existing operational subway tunnels, and systematic assessment was undertaken for each tunnel crossing with the capacity of each subway tunnel calculated in terms of an allowable bending curvature, and systems of monitoring trigger levels and associated contingency plans were prepared to manage any adverse events. Wang and Yu (2006) related the construction of Line 2 tunnels of Shanghai Subway above the existing Line 8 tunnels, and gave the recorded response of the existing tunnels. Kojima et al.

Shao and Zhang (2007) set up a new FEM based on the concept of ground loss, and its applicability was verified by comparing the calculated displacements with those obtained by the empirical method, and the method was used to simulate construction of Line 4 shield tunnels <b>under-crossing</b> Line 2 tunnels of Shanghai subway. Duarte et al. (2009) focused on monitoring of the settlements of Line 2 twin running tunnels during the excavation of Line 4 double-track running tunnel with a shallow overburden of 7.5  m in São Paulo, Brazil. The used on-line monitoring system consisted of an array of precision vibrating wire liquid level settlement sensors. The maximum settlement recorded during the excavation was in the order of 2  mm, yielding a maximum differential settlement of about 1 : 1900 well below the established tolerance. Fu et al.
