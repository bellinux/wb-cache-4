50|$|Both tankers were {{constructed}} in Nagasaki, Japan by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd, work beginning on the Venoil in October 1972 and the Venpet in January 1973. The vessels were completed in March and June 1973 respectively {{at the cost}} of approximately $28m each. Each vessel was more than 330,000 deadweight (DWT) which, at the time, classified them as Very <b>Large</b> <b>Crude</b> <b>Carriers</b> (VLCCs).

5000|$|From June 2014 to January 2015, as {{the price}} of oil dropped 60 percent and the supply of oil {{remained}} high, the world's <b>largest</b> traders in <b>crude</b> oil purchased at least 25 million barrels to store in supertankers to make a profit in the future when prices rise. Trafigura, Vitol, Gunvor, Koch, Shell and other major energy companies began to book booking oil storage supertankers for up to 12 months.

50|$|The {{development}} of PIPC {{is located at}} Pengerang, Kota Tinggi District, Johor, Malaysia which is a strategic location at the south-east tip of Peninsular Malaysia. It offers access to existing major international shipping lanes connecting Middle East-Singapore and China. It has excellent road networks to Singapore and other major ports in the Peninsula. Its safe and sheltered harbour with a natural water depth of 24m provides perfect berthing conditions for <b>Ultra</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Crude</b> <b>Carriers</b> (ULCCs) and Very <b>Large</b> <b>Crude</b> <b>Carriers</b> (VLCCs). No breakwater is required with sufficient seagoing passage for ULCCs and VLCCs. Pengerang also offers availability of sufficient development land with low negative socioeconomic impact and very few Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) which are easily preserved.|$|R
50|$|The {{component}} of this mammoth project (PIPC) was first initiated {{with the development}} of the Pengerang Deepwater Terminal or PDT, a joint-venture between Dialog Group, Royal Vopak of the Netherlands and the State of Johor. Serving as a centralised storage facility for trading, refining and petrochemical industry, the Deepwater Terminal is envisioned to have a storage capacity of 5 million cubic meters. The USD3 billion facility includes an independent terminal for trading, a dedicated industrial terminal for investors within PIPC, and a Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal. The construction of a deepwater jetty facility with natural water depth would enable the berthing of both <b>ultra</b> <b>large</b> <b>crude</b> <b>carriers</b> and very <b>large</b> <b>crude</b> <b>carriers.</b> PDT received its first shipment of oil {{in the first quarter of}} 2014 and continues to cater to the growing demand for its services.|$|R

50|$|Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (OSG) is {{a tanker}} company engaged {{primarily}} in the ocean transportation of crude oil and petroleum products. As of December 31, 2010, the Company owned or operated a modern fleet of 111 vessels (aggregating 11.3 million deadweight tons and 864,800 cubic meters) of which 88 vessels operated in the international market and 23 operated in the U.S. Flag market. OSG’s newbuilding program of owned and chartered-in vessels totaled 11 International and U.S. Flag vessels, bringing the Company’s total owned, operated and newbuild fleet to 122 vessels. The Company’s vessel operations are organized into strategic business units and focused on market segments: crude oil, refined petroleum products, and U.S. Flag. The International Flag Crude Tanker unit manages International Flag <b>ultra</b> <b>large</b> <b>crude</b> <b>carrier</b> (ULCC), {{very large crude carrier}} (VLCC), Suezmax, Aframax, Panamax and Lightering tankers; the International Flag Product Carrier unit principally manages LR1 and MR product carriers and the U.S. unit manages most of the Company’s U.S. Flag vessels. Through joint venture partnerships, the Company operates four LNG carriers and two Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO) service vessels.During the year ended December 31, 2010, OSG took delivery of 11 vessels. During 2010, the Company sold three owned U.S. Flag vessels, the Overseas Philadelphia, Overseas Diligence and Overseas Galena Bay, and one chartered-in International Flag Aframax, the Sabine, a chartered-in lightering vessel. As of December 31, 2010, OSG’s owned, operated and newbuild fleet aggregated 122 vessels. Of this total, 95 vessels are International Flag and 27 vessels are U.S. Flag.

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{favorable}} size, Aframax tankers can serve most ports in the world.

Aframax class tankers are largely used in the basins of the Black Sea, the North Sea, the Caribbean Sea, the South and East China Seas, and the Mediterranean. Non-OPEC exporting countries may require the use of tankers because the harbors and canals through which these countries export their oil are too small to accommodate the larger Suezmax or the larger still very <b>large</b> <b>crude</b> <b>carriers</b> and ultra-large <b>crude</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
