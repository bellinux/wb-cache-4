40|$|PURPOSE: Virtual {{planning}} and guided surgery {{with or without}} prebent or <b>milled</b> <b>plates</b> {{are becoming more and}} more common for mandibular reconstruction with fibular free flaps (FFFs). Although this excellent surgical option is being used more widely, the question of the additional cost of {{planning and}} cutting-guide production has to be discussed. In capped payment systems such additional costs have to be offset by other savings if there are no special provisions for extra funding. Our study was designed to determine whether using virtual planning and guided surgery resulted in time saved during surgery and whether this time gain resulted in self-funding of such planning through the time saved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All consecutive cases of FFF surgery were evaluated during a 2 -year period. Institutional data were used to determine the price of 1 minute of operative time. The time for fibula molding, plate adaptation, and insetting was recorded. RESULTS: During the defined period, we performed 20 mandibular reconstructions using FFFs, 9 with virtual planning and guided surgery and 11 freehand cases. One minute of operative time was calculated to cost US $ 47. 50. Multiplying this number by the time saved, we found that the additional cost of virtual planning was reduced from US $ 5, 098 to US $ 1, 231. 50 with a prebent plate and from US $ 6, 980 to US $ 3, 113. 50 for a <b>milled</b> <b>plate.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or <b>milled</b> <b>plates</b> are financially viable...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUse of T-bars in {{shipbuilding}} {{has increased}} recently. Although T-bars having a web height {{of at least}} twice the flange width are generally required for ships, the dimensions of existing hot-rolled T-bars are not suitable. As a result, T-bars for ships are typically fabricated by welding two plates. To solve this problem, a new rolling method for T-bars using a <b>universal</b> <b>mill</b> and edger mill was investigated. Finite element analyses of universal and edger rolling were executed to investigate the characteristics of side camber. Next, multi-pass rolling experiments simulating the rolling passes at a <b>universal</b> roughing <b>mill</b> and an edger mill were performed, and straight pure lead T-bars having satisfactory cross sections were obtained. However, the web heights {{at the top and}} tail ends were larger than those of the other part. Additional vertical rolls were applied to edger rolling to enable a slight reduction of the web height, and the web height deflection was eliminated by this new arrangement. The results of this research clearly demonstrated the potential of the new rolling process for producing T-bars of ships...|$|R
40|$|The {{selection}} of machining parameters in <b>milling</b> thin-walled <b>plates</b> affects deformation, quality, and {{productivity of the}} machined parts. This paper presents an optimization procedure to determine and validate the optimum machining parameters in <b>milling</b> thin-walled <b>plates.</b> The regression models for cutting force and surface roughness are developed as objective functions according to experimental results. Besides, the influences of machining parameters on cutting force and surface roughness are also investigated. The objectives under investigation {{in this study are}} cutting force, surface roughness, and material removal rate subjected to constraints conditions. As the effects of milling parameters on optimization objectives are conflicting in nature, the multi-objective optimization problem in thin-walled <b>plates</b> <b>milling</b> is proposed. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is then adopted to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. The optimized combinations of machining parameters are achieved by the Pareto optimal solutions, and these solutions are verified by the chatter stability...|$|R
