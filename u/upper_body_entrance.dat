40|$|We {{propose a}} Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model for <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> tracking. We first {{construct}} a Bayesian Network (BN) {{to represent the}} human <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> structure and then incorporate into the BN various generic physical and anatomical constraints on {{the parts of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>body.</b> Unlike the existing <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> models, ours aims at handling physically feasible body motion rather than only some typical motion patterns. We also explicitly model part self-occlusion in the DBN model, which allows to automatically detect the occurrence of self-occlusion and to minimize the effect of measurement errors on the tracking accuracy due to occlusion. Moreover, our method can handle both 2 D and 3 D <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> tracking within the same framework. Using the DBN model, <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> tracking can be achieved through probabilistic inference over time. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Automatic {{perception}} of human posture and gesture from vision input {{has an important}} role in developing intelligent video systems. In this paper, we present a novel gesture recognition approach for human computer interactivity based on marker-less <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> pose tracking in 3 -D with multiple cameras. To achieve the robustness and real-time performance required for practical applications, the idea is to break the exponentially large search problem of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> pose into two steps: first, the 3 -D movements of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> extremities (i. e., head and hands) are tracked. Then using knowledge of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> model constraints, these extremities movements are used to infer the whole 3 -D <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> motion as an inverse kinematics problem. Since the head and hand regions are typically well defined and undergo less occlusion, tracking is more reliable and could enable more robust <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> pose determination. Moreover, by breaking the problem of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> pose tracking into two steps, the complexity is reduced considerably. Using pose tracking output, the gesture recognition is then done based on longest common subsequence similarity measurement of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> joint angles dynamics. In our experiment, we provide an extensive validation of the proposed <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> pose tracking from 3 -D extremity movement which showed good results with various subjects in different environments. Regarding the gesture recognition based on joint angles dynamics, our experimental evaluation of five subjects doing six <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> gestures with average classification accuracies over 90 % indicates the promise and feasibility of the proposed system.

Before extracting variables related to <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> motion, acceleration signals require realignment to a global reference; however, {{the impact of these}} techniques on the resulting <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> variables is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to examine the impact of four different realignment methods designed to correct acceleration signals on a range of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> variables in older adults and in patients with PD. Two minutes of continuous gait were measured in 54 community-dwelling older adults (71. 1 � 6. 7 years) and 60 people with PD (age: 68. 5 � 9. 1 years). Three IMUs placed on the 5 th lumbar vertebra, 7 th cervical vertebra and {{the back of the head}} recorded the acceleration of the <b>upper</b> <b>body.</b> A selection of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> variables sensitive to impaired <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> control in PD and four acceleration realignment methods were compared. A mixed-model ANOVA showed that the choice of realignment method significantly affected the values of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> variables as well as their ability to discriminate between the PD and control group. Our findings indicate researchers and clinicians should be cautious when comparing <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> variables extracted from IMUs using different realignment methods, and consideration of realignmenttechnique will be important when identifying the most sensitive markers of disease presence and progression.

However it presents technical challenges due to the complexity of human motion. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for human <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> pose recognition using labeled (i. e., recognized) human body parts in depth silhouettes. Our proposed method performs human <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> parts labeling using trained random forests (RFs) and utilizes support vector machines (SVMs) to recognize various <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> poses. To train RFs, we create a database of synthetic depth silhouettes of the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> and their corresponding <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> parts labeled maps using a commercial computer graphics package. Once the body parts get labeled with the trained RFs, a skeletal <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> model is generated from the labeled body parts. Then, SVMs are trained with a set of joint angle features to recognize seven <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> poses. The experimental results show the mean recognition rate of 97. 62 %.

In this model, <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> mass m_ 1 is constrained to move vertically inside m_ 2. m_ 2 can moves freely horizontally and vertically above ground. m_ 2 and spring constant k are held constant. Gravitational force is set to 9.8  m/s^ 2 and air resistance is neglected. For each simulation spring extension Δ z is initialized to 0.15  m.

40|$|Concurrent {{training}} (CT) {{is defined}} as the development of both endurance and strength within the same exercise program. CT has been studied for decades, but the results has been diverse. However, very few have studied the effects of CT on the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> musculature. Hence, this review set out to investigate the effects of combined strength and endurance training (ET) of the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> on muscle hypertrophy, muscle strength and endurance variables. PubMed was searched with relevant search terms with varying combinations, such as concurrent training, combined strength and endurance training. After scanning the literature, a total of eight articles were included. The results suggest that muscle strength, exercise economy and time to exhaustion can effectively be improved by CT of the <b>upper</b> <b>body.</b> The effect of CT on <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> musculature were unclear. Some of the articles included suggests a decrease in whole body lean mass, which might simply be due to insufficient loading of the lower body musculature. In order to maintain muscle mass during a CT protocol, endurance athletes should aim to perform ST which targets muscles active during ET. However, the limited empiric literature available on CT of the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> makes a conclusion hard to draw. This review shows that CT of the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> is yet an unexplored and researchers should further investigate the effects of CT for the musculature of the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> alone.

40|$|<b>Upper</b> <b>body</b> {{power output}} {{is a key}} aspect of {{athletic}} ability and sporting performance. As a consequence, empirical-based research has aimed to identify {{the most effective and}} efficient ways to develop muscular power. However, identifying the effectiveness of an acute training stimulus or long-term training regime in developing muscular power requires accurate and valid measures of muscular power itself. Furthermore, tests of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> power output may prove beneficial for talent identification and fatigue monitoring purposes. Therefore identifying reliable and valid means of assessing <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> power output is essential to both the research and coaching community. Force platforms have been proposed as effective and reliable tools to assess both <b>upper</b> and lower <b>body</b> power output. The majority of research has investigated the efficacy of force-time derived performance measures of lower body power output during exercises such as the countermovement jump (3 - 5, 8 - 9, 12). Despite <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> muscular power being a key aspect of athletic performance, few research studies have investigated the reliability of using force platforms to assess <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> power output (6, 7). Furthermore, the reliability of using force platforms to assess measures of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> power output in elite and sub-elite sporting populations is yet to be investigated.

Methods: Twenty-two semi-elite RL players and 24 physically active but untrained men completed a maximal oxygen consumption test (VO 2 max test) on a treadmill and electronic arm ergometer in a randomized order. Percent body fat was calculated from the sum of six skinfolds. Results: Lower and <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> absolute (P= 0. 03 and P= 0. 02 respectively) but not relative VO 2 max was higher in the RL group compared to the control group. <b>Upper</b> <b>body</b> peak power (P= 0. 001), ventilation (P= 0. 05) and lactate concentration (P= 0. 03) were higher in the RL group compared to the control group. Maximum heart rate was lower during arm ergometry for both groups (P ≤ 0. 001) compared to predicted and treadmill values. Conclusions: The results show that while semi-elite RL players have above average lower body aerobic capacity their <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> aerobic capacity is not well developed and similar to untrained men.
