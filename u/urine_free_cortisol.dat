40|$|Background: Relative adrenal {{insufficiency}} {{is a negative}} prognostic marker for patients with septic shock. Cortisol is highly protein-bound so the hypoproteinaemic state in these patients complicates the diagnosis of {{adrenal insufficiency}} using total <b>cortisol</b> measurement. Direct <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> measurement, however, is not suitable for routine use. Surrogate markers of <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> were evaluated for relative adrenal insufficiency diagnosis. Objectives: We aimed to compare the diagnostic value of stimulated, <b>free</b> and total <b>cortisol</b> to assess adrenal function and to determine the accuracy and diagnostic value of surrogate markers (total cortisol:CBG ratio, total cortisol:albumin ratio, Coolen’s equation, and an adapted Vermeulen’s equation) as indices of adrenal insufficiency. Methods: The standard 250 μg SST was conducted on fifteen control subjects and five samples from patients with septic shock. Baseline samples were analysed for ACTH (Immulite) and albumin (BCG) concentrations. Serum total <b>cortisol</b> (Elecsys), <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> (steady state gel filtration) and cortisol binding globulin (CBG, Biosource RIA) concentrations were determined in samples taken 0, 30 and 60 minutes after synacthen administration. Results: Albumin and CBG concentrations were significantly lower and baseline total and <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> concentrations were significantly higher in patients than control subjects (p< 0. 002). All surrogate markers correlated well with <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> across {{the duration of the}} SST. <b>Free</b> <b>cortisol</b> values determined by an adapted Vermeulen’s equation showed the greatest association (r 2 = 0. 959, p= 0. 01). Coolen’s equation was clinically most significant identifying the same patients to have adrenal insufficiency as direct <b>free</b> <b>cortisol.</b> Conclusions: Serum <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> concentrations are likely to provide a more accurate reflection of adrenal status than total cortisol concentrations in hypoproteinaemic pateints.

40|$|When used in high doses, inhaled {{corticosteroids}} {{may cause}} {{suppression of the}} hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. The influence of the mode of drug inhalation {{on the degree of}} this suppression is not clear.

Twelve patients had hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression, as judged by subnormal results from {{at least two of the}} three tests or (in one patient) by an abnormal insulin stress test response. These patients then changed to inhaling the same dose of beclomethasone dipropionate through a 750 ml spacer device (Volumatic). The endocrine tests were repeated from nine days to eight weeks later in 10 patients. Comparison with initial values showed that adding the spacing device caused an increase in the median 0900 h cortisol concentration from 126 nmol/l to 398 nmol/l, in the post-tetracosactrin cortisol concentration from 402 nmol/l to 613 nmol/l and in 24 hour <b>urine</b> <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> excretion from 54 nmol to 84 nmol. The rise in serum cortisol concentration in response to tetracosactrin did not change. Evidence of persisting hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression was present in only four of the 10 patients; the most pronounced improvements in function tended to occur in those who had never required long term oral corticosteroids. The results from this uncontrolled study suggest that asthmatic patients taking high dose beclomethasone dipropionate may minimise adverse effects by using a large volume spacer device...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic ACTH secretion, where the only potential source on conventional imaging was a tiny benign-appearing lung nodule, which failed to take up radiolabelled octreotide.

Compared to ACTH and cortisol levels on a control day, the levels following the test dose of octreotide were lower. Subsequent therapeutic administration of subcutaneous octreotide normalised <b>urine</b> <b>free</b> <b>cortisol,</b> with symptomatic improvement, pending evaluation for surgery. Eventual resection of the lung nodule resulted in cure of hypercortisolism. Histological examination of the resected specimen confirmed bronchial carcinoid staining positive for ACTH.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{systematically}} analyze patient outcomes after repeat transsphenoidal (TS) {{surgery for}} recurrent Cushing's disease. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of all patients with recurrent Cushing's disease who underwent repeat TS surgery for resection of a pituitary corticotroph adenoma at the University of Virginia Medical Center from 1992 to 2006. Remission at follow-up {{was defined as}} a normal postoperative 24 -hour <b>urine</b> <b>free</b> <b>cortisol,</b> or continued need for glucocorticoid replacement after repeat TS surgery. Recurrence of the disease {{was defined as a}}n elevated 24 -hour <b>urine</b> <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> with clinical symptoms consistent with Cushing's disease while not receiving glucocorticoid replacement. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate the effect of potential predictors on remission. Recurrence rates, subsequent treatments, and the final endocrine status of the patients are presented. RESULTS: We identified 36 patients who underwent repeat TS surgery for recurrent Cushing's disease. The mean age of the patients was 40. 3 years (range, 17. 1 - 63. 0 yr), and 26 were women. The median time to recurrence after initial successful TS surgery was 36 months (range, 4 mo- 16 yr). Remission after repeat TS surgery was observed in 22 (61 %) of the 3 6 patients. During the same time period, of the 338 patients who underwent first-time TS surgery for Cushing's disease, remission was achieved in 289 (85. 5 %). The odds of failure (to achieve remission) for patients with repeat TS surgery for recurrent Cushing's disease were 3. 7 times that of patients undergoing first-time TS surgery (odds ratio, 3. 7; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 8 - 7. 8). Two of the 22 patients with successful repeat TS surgery had a second recurrence at 6 and 11 months, respectively. Complete biochemical and clinical remission after stereotactic radiosurgery, adrenalectomy, and ongoing ketoconazole therapy was achieved in 30 (83. 3 %) of the 36 patients, and active disease continued in 6 patients (16. 7 %). CONCLUSION: Although the success of repeat TS surgery for recurrence of Cushing's disease is less than that of initial surgery, a second procedure offers a reasonable possibility of immediate remission, if the operation is not successful, other treatments, including pituitary radiation, medical therapy, and even bilateral adrenalectomy, are required...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOvernight urine {{samples were}} {{obtained}} from 34 asthmatic children, 24 of whom were receiving inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), and 30 controls. The urine volume of the children receiving inhaled steroids was significantly {{greater than that of}} the other asthmatic children and of the controls (P < 0 · 05). Urine growth hormone was within the normal range for all of the subjects and there was no demonstrable relationship between urine growth hormone and height or height standard deviation score. Urine steroid output was significantly reduced in the BDP receiving group when the results were expressed in Ul− 1 but {{there was no difference between}} the groups when the results were expressed per specimen. Urine adenosine 3 ′ 5 ′ cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) results were similar for all groups. We conclude that use of BDP increases overnight urine volume but, in our study, does not appear to influence the output of urine cortisol. <b>Urine</b> <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> measurements may not be a very sensitive tool for the detection of small changes in endogenous steroid production.

40|$|Published data on adrenocortical {{function}} in septic shock have enrolled patients {{at various stages}} of critical illness and predominantly used plasma total cortisol, with minimal information on serial changes. Moreover, plasma <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> and tissue corticosteroid activity may not be strongly associated; however, few published data exist. The aim of this prospective observational {{study was to investigate}} serial changes in plasma total and <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> and tissue cortisol activity in septic shock. Twenty-nine adult patients admitted with septic shock to a tertiary-level intensive care unit were enrolled. A low-dose corticotropin test was performed on day 1. Plasma total and <b>free</b> <b>cortisol,</b> cortisone, transcortin, and urinary <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> and cortisone were analyzed on days 1 to 5, 7, and 10. Urinary and plasma cortisol-cortisone ratios (F:E ratio) were calculated as indices of 11 -β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 and global 11 -β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, respectively. Baseline total and <b>free</b> plasma <b>cortisol</b> values from 10 healthy control subjects were obtained for comparative analysis. Baseline plasma total and <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> levels were significantly higher than controls (457. 8 ± 193 vs. 252 ± 66 nmol/L, P = 0. 0002; and 50. 83 ± 43. 19 vs. 6. 4 ± 3. 2, P < 0. 0001, respectively). Plasma <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> rose proportionately higher than total cortisol (124 % ± 217. 3 % vs. 40 % ± 33. 2 %, P = 0. 007) following corticotropin. Baseline plasma and urinary F:E ratios were elevated over the reference ranges (13. 13 ± 1. 5, 1. 69 ± 2. 8) and were not correlated with plasma <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> values (r = 0. 2, 0. 3 respectively). Over the study period, total cortisol levels and plasma F:E ratios remained elevated, whereas plasma <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> levels and urinary F:E ratio declined. At baseline, plasma <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> levels were higher in patients who subsequently survived (23. 7 ± 10. 5 vs. 57. 9 ± 45. 8 nmol/L, P = 0. 04).

40|$|Context: Severe {{systemic}} infection leads to hypercortisolism. Reduced cortisol binding proteins may accentuate the <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> elevations seen in {{systemic infection}}. Recently, low total cortisol increments after tetracosactrin {{have been associated}} with increased mortality and hemodynamic responsiveness to exogenous hydrocortisone in septic shock (SS), a phenomenon termed by some investigators as relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI). Hypothesis: <b>Free</b> plasma <b>cortisol</b> may correspond more closely to illness severity than total cortisol, comparing SS and sepsis (S). Design: This was a prospective study. Setting: This study took place in a tertiary teaching hospital. Patients: Patients had SS (n = 45) or S (n = 19) or were healthy controls (HCs; n = 10). Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} compare total with <b>free</b> <b>cortisol,</b> measured directly and estimated by Coolens’ method, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), and albumin in patients with SS (with and without RAI) and S during acute illness, recovery, and convalescence. Results: Comparing SS, S, and HC subjects, <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> levels reflected illness severity more closely than total <b>cortisol</b> (basal <b>free</b> <b>cortisol,</b> SS, 186 vs. S, 29 vs. HC, 13 nmol/liter, P < 0. 001 compared with basal total cortisol, SS, 880 vs. S, 417 vs. HC, 352 nmol/liter, P < 0. 001). Stimulated <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> increments varied greatly with illness category (SS, 192 vs. S, 115 vs. HC, 59 nmol/liter, P = 0. 004), whereas total cortisol increments did not (SS, 474 vs. S, 576 vs. HC, 524 nmol/liter, P = 0. 013). The lack of increase in total cortisol with illness severity is due to lower CBG and albumin. One third of patients with SS (15 of 45) but no S patients met a recently described criterion for RAI (total cortisol increment after tetracosactrin ≤ 248 nmol/liter). RAI patients had higher basal total cortisol (1157 vs. 756 nmol/liter; P = 0. 028) and basal <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> (287 vs. 140 nmol/liter; P = 0. 017) than non-RAI patients. Mean cortisol increments in RAI were lower (total, 99 vs. 648 nmol/liter, P < 0. 001; free, 59 vs. 252 nmol/liter, P < 0. 001). These differences were not due to altered CBG or albumin levels. <b>Free</b> <b>cortisol</b> levels normalized more promptly than total cortisol in convalescence. Calculated <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> by Coolens’ method compared closely with measured <b>free</b> <b>cortisol.</b> Conclusions: <b>Free</b> <b>cortisol</b> is likely to be a better guide to cortisolemia in systemic infection because it corresponds more closely to illness severity. The attenuated cortisol increment after tetracosactrin in RAI is not due to low cortisol-binding proteins. <b>Free</b> <b>cortisol</b> levels can be determined reliably using total cortisol and CBG levels.

40|$|Copyright © 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc. OBJECTIVES: To develop, optimize, and {{validate}} {{a generalized}} mass action, equilibrium solution that incorporates measured concentrations of albumin {{as well as}} cortisol binding globulin (CBG) to estimate <b>free</b> <b>cortisol.</b> DESIGN AND METHODS: <b>Free</b> <b>cortisol</b> was estimated by Coolens method or by cubic equilibrium equation and compared to measured <b>free</b> <b>cortisol,</b> determined by ultrafiltration method, in subjects with septic shock (n= 45), sepsis (n= 19), and healthy controls (n= 10) at 0, 30, and 60 min following administration of cosyntropin (250 mcg). The data set also included repeat testing in 30 subjects following recovery from sepsis/septic shock. The equilibrium dissociation constant for cortisol binding to albumin (K(A)) was optimized by non-linear regression. The cubic equilibrium solution was also used to model the influence of cortisol, CBG, and albumin concentration on <b>free</b> <b>cortisol.</b> RESULTS: Compared to measured <b>free</b> <b>cortisol,</b> the cubic solution, using an optimized K(A) of 137, 800 nM, was less biased than Coolens solution, with mean percent error of - 23. 0 % vs. - 41. 1 % (paired t test, P< 0. 001). Standard deviation values were also significantly lower (Wilks' test, P< 0. 001) for the cubic solution (SD 35. 8 % vs. 40. 8 % for cubic vs. Coolens, respectively). Modeling studies using the cubic solution suggest an interaction effect by which low concentrations of CBG and albumin contribute to a greater increase in <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> {{than the sum of}} their independent effects. CONCLUSIONS: Mass action solutions that incorporate the measured concentration of albumin as well as CBG provide a reasonably accurate estimate of <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> that generalizes to conditions of health as well as a setting of hypercortisolism and low CBG and albumin concentrations associated with septic shock. Modeling studies emphasize the significant contribution of albumin deficiency and albumin-bound cortisol under conditions of CBG-deficiency, and identify a synergistic effect by which combined CBG and albumin deficiency contribute to elevation of <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> in septic shock.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this randomized, {{double-blind}} parallel group study was to compare the safety, tolerability and acceptability of Easyhaler® and Turbuhaler® dry powder inhalers for the delivery of budesonide 800 μ g day− 1 in adult asthmatic patients who had already been treated with inhaled corticosteroids for at least 6 {{months prior to the}} study. Additionally the efficacy of the products was evaluated. The main objective was to evaluate the systemic safety of budesonide inhaled from Easyhaler® (Giona® Easyhaler®, Orion Pharma, Finland) as determined by serum and urine cortisol measurements. The secondary objective was to compare the tolerability, acceptability and efficacy of the two devices in the administration of budesonide. After a 2 -week run-in period (baseline), patients were randomized on a 2 : 1 basis to receive budesonide from Easyhaler® (n= 103) or from Turbuhaler® (Pulmicort® Turbuhaler®, AstraZeneca, Sweden) (n= 58) 200 μ g dose− 1, two inhalations twice daily for 12 weeks. There was no statistically significant change in morning serum cortisol values from baseline to the end of treatment in either group. <b>Urine</b> <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> and urine cortisol/creatinine ratio increased from baseline in both groups. There {{were no significant differences between}} the groups in terms of morning serum cortisol, urine cortisol, adverse events or efficacy variables, but Easyhaler® was generally considered more acceptable to the patients. In conclusion, at 800 μ g day− 1, Giona® Easyhaler® is as safe and efficacious as Pulmicort® Turbuhaler® in adult asthmatic patients previously treated with corticosteroids, but more acceptable to patients...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundIn {{subclinical}} Cushing syndrome (SC), it {{is assumed}} that glucocorticoid production is insufficient to cause a clinically recognizable syndrome. Differences in hormonal levels or recovery time of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis after adrenalectomy between patients with overt Cushing syndrome (OC) and SC remain unknown. MethodsThirty-six patients (10 with OC and 26 with SC) with adrenal Cushing syndrome who underwent adrenalectomy from 2004 to 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were treated with glucocorticoid after adrenalectomy and were reevaluated every 1 to 6 months using a rapid adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. ResultsLevels of basal 24 -hour <b>urine</b> <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> (UFC), serum cortisol after an overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST), and serum cortisol and 24 -hour UFC after low-dose DST and high-dose DST were all significantly lower in patients with SC compared with OC. Basal ACTH levels showed significantly higher in patients with SC compared with OC. The probability of recovering adrenal function during follow-up differed significantly between patients with OC and SC (P= 0. 001), with significant correlations with the degree of preoperative cortisol excess. Patients with OC required a longer duration of glucocorticoid replacement to recover a normal ACTH stimulation test compared with patients with SC (median 17. 0 months vs. 4. 0 months, P< 0. 001). ConclusionThe HPA axis recovery time after adrenalectomy in patients with SC is rapid and is dependent on the degree of cortisol excess. More precise definition of SC is necessary to achieve a better management of patients and to avoid the risk of under- or over-treatment of SC patients...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a number}} of links between the {{endocrine}} system and the nervous system. In this study, the impact of ischemic stroke on the endocrine system was investigated. Elderly volunteers were studied because data regarding the influence of advanced age on endocrine parameters were lacking. Only small differences in pituitary-thyroid and pituitary-adrenal hormone axes were found between two groups of elderly patients, 60 and 80 years of age. The 80 -year-old age group had a lower thyrotropin response to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and a decline in dopamine excretion. Patients with acute ischemic stroke showed a pronounced hypercortisolism studied by the dexamethasone test and <b>urine</b> <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> measurements. In multiple regression analyses, postdexamethasone cortisol levels were positively correlated to proximity of the lesion to the frontal pole of the brain and disorientation. Urine cortisol levels were predicted by limb paresis, disorientation and body temperature. High cortisol excretion was associated with a worse functional outcome. Norepinephrine excretion was correlated to urine cortisol levels and to motor impairment. Patients with acute stroke had elevated free thyroxin indices. A paradoxical growth hormone response to TRH was found in the majority of stroke patients. In a multiple regression model disorientation was negatively correlated to thyrotropin response after TRH and positively correlated to prolactin response. Growth hormone response to TRH was associated with extensive paresis. In a cohort study diabetic and non-diabetic patients were prospectively studied after an initial stroke. Diabetes mellitus adversely influenced survival, the risk for a recurrent stroke and myocardial infarction. S. 1 - 66 : sammanfattning, s. 69 - 190 : 6 uppsatser digitalisering@um...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Subtle dysregulations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis {{in chronic}} fatigue {{syndrome}} have been described. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the negative feedback regulations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in {{chronic fatigue syndrome}}. METHODS: In 21 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome and 21 healthy control subjects, awakening and circadian salivary <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> profiles were assessed over 2 consecutive days and compared with awakening and circadian salivary <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> profiles after administration of 0. 5 mg of dexamethasone at 11 : 00 PM the previous day. RESULTS: Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome had normal salivary <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> profiles but showed enhanced and prolonged suppression of salivary <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> after the administration of 0. 5 mg of dexamethasone in comparison to the control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced negative feedback of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis could be a plausible explanation for the previously described alterations in hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning in chronic fatigue syndrome. Because similar changes have been described in stress-related disorders, a putative role of stress in the pathogenesis of the enhanced feedback is possible...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} cortisol and catecholamine {{levels in}} patients with Meniere's disease. Study Design: Prospective, controlled study. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: Thirty patients with Meniere's disease and 18 healthy controls. Main Outcome Measures: Serum and saliva cortisol, serum cortisol after the dexamethasone suppression test, <b>urine</b> <b>free</b> <b>cortisol,</b> and urine catecholamines. Results: The serum and saliva cortisol levels were higher in Meniere's patients compared with their control group: 440 +/- 127 (n = 28) versus 366 +/- 90 (nmol/L) (n = 18) and 17. 2 +/- 6. 1 (n = 18) versus 11. 6 +/- 4. 6 (nmol/L) (n = 9), respectively. Both differences were significant (P < 0. 05). There were no dissimilarities in urine cortisol or urine catecholamines for either group. Twenty-eight Meniere's patients {{were divided into two}} subgroups, namely, high- and low-cortisol groups, using a serum cortisol level cutoff point of 465 nmol/L (median). The total Meniere's disease time and the duration of tinnitus tended to be longer in the high-cortisol group (p = 0. 07, two-tailed). The total Meniere's disease time was 13. 5 +/- 9. 9 years in the high-cortisol group and 7. 1 +/- 7. 4 years in the low-cortisol group (n = 14 for both). The subgroups were matched for age, gender, and unilaterally or bilaterally affected ears. Conclusion: Patients with Meniere's disease have higher serum cortisol levels. It is suggested that these higher cortisol levels are rather the result than the cause of this chronic disease, because patients affected longer seem to have higher cortisol levels. The exact impact of these higher cortisol levels on the inner ear and endolymph homeostasis is yet unknown...|$|E
40|$|Background: Measurement of {{the plasma}} adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level has been {{recommended}} {{as the first}} diag-nostic test for differentiating between ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome (CS) and ACTH-dependent CS. When plasma ACTH values are inconclusive, a differential diagnosis of CS can be made based upon measurement of the serum dehydroepian-drosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) level and results of the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDST). The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the utility of plasma ACTH to differentiate adrenal CS from Cushing ’ disease (CD) and compare it with that of the HDST results and serum DHEA-S level. Methods: We performed a retrospective, multicenter study from January 2000 to May 2012 involving 92 patients with endoge-nous CS. The levels of plasma ACTH, serum cortisol, 24 -hour <b>urine</b> <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> (UFC) after the HDST, and serum DHEA-S were measured. Results: Fifty-seven patients had adrenal CS and 35 patients had CD. The area under the curve of plasma ACTH, serum DHEA-S, percentage suppression of serum cortisol, and UFC after HDST were 0. 954, 0. 841, 0. 950, and 0. 997, respectively (all P< 0. 001). The cut-off values for plasma ACTH, percentage suppression of serum cortisol, and UFC after HDST were 5. 3 pmol/ L, 33. 3 %, and 61. 6 %, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of plasma ACTH measurement were 84. 2 % and 94. 3 %, those of serum cortisol were 95. 8 % and 90. 6 %, and those of UFC after the HDST were 97. 9 % and 96. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is rare with only 20 % of patients having a primary adrenal cause of hypercortisolism. We {{have developed a}} strategy to evaluate patients with suspected Cushing's syndrome and to localize the pathologic condition responsible for the hypercortisolism. This report reviews the last 11 consecutive patients who had a primary adrenal cause of hypercortisolism. Each patient had elevated 24 -hour <b>urine</b> <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> and 17 -hydroxycorticosteroid excretion consistent with hypercortisolism. All but one patient had undetectable plasma ACTH levels. No patient suppressed urinary steroid levels with high-dose dexamethasone and only one patient increased plasma ACTH or cortisol levels with oCRH, findings that were consistent with a pituitary-independent form of hypercortisolism. No patient had a pituitary tumor detected by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, and eight patients had adrenal tumors accurately imaged. MRI of the adrenal glands correctly diagnosed adenoma in 5 of 6 patients with adenomas, carcinoma in 1 patient, and ACTH-producing pheochromocytoma in 1 patient. One tumor classified as carcinoma by MRI appeared on pathologic examination to be an adenoma. Three patients underwent petrosal sinus sampling for measurement of ACTH before and after oCRH administration, and each had petrosal sinus ACTH levels equal to peripheral levels, consistent with a primary adrenal cause of hypercortisolism. Two of these patients had typical bilateral pigmented micronodular adrenocortical disease and the third patient had macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia. Each of the 11 patients was cured of hypercortisolism by unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy and no patient has developed recurrent disease during the 7 to 29 month follow-up period. New modalities including the ovine CRH test, MRI, and petrosal sinus sampling have improved the evaluation of certain patients with Cushing's syndrome...|$|E

40|$|Background: Pregnancy and {{postpartum}} {{have been}} associated to several physiological changes;however, empirical evidence was almost exclusively obtained in primiparous women and few studies focus on hormonal changes in men and second-time parents. The main {{aim of this study}} is to examine 24 -h urinary <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> from mid-pregnancy to 3 -months postpartum, comparing women/men and first/second-time parents. Methods: Twenty-six women and 22 men (N = 48) were recruited from an antenatal obstetric unit in Porto, Portugal. 24 -h urinary <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> was measured at the 2 nd and 3 rd trimester and at 3 -months postpartum. Repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted, in order to analyze 24 -h urinary <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> patterns of change over this period. Gender and parity were included in the analyses as potential modifiers, in order to compare women and men, and first-and second-time parents. Results: An increase from the 2 nd to the 3 rd trimester (p =. 006) and a decrease from the 3 rd trimester to 3 -months postpartum (p =. 005) were reported in all parents’ 24 -h urinary <b>free</b> <b>cortisol.</b> The interaction effects for Time * Gender (p =. 03) and Time * Parity (p =. 02) were found. Women and first-time parents revealed higher levels, while men and second-time parents showed lower 24 -h urinary <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> levels at the 2 nd trimester than at 3 -months postpartum. Conclusions: Findings appear to clarify the direction, as well as, the timing, gender and parity extension of 24 -h urinary <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> changes from mid-pregnancy to 3 -months postpartum. The same pattern of change in all parents’ 24 -h urinary <b>free</b> <b>cortisol</b> from mid-pregnancy to 3 -months postpartum is consistent with the proposed role of hormones in preparation to parenting.
