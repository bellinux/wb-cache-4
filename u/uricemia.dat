40|$|International audiencePlasma urate {{levels are}} higher in humans than rodents (240 - 360 vs. ∼ 30 μM) because humans lack the liver enzyme uricase. High <b>uricemia</b> in humans may protect against {{oxidative}} stress, but hyperuricemia also associates with the metabolic syndrome, and urate and uric acid can crystallize to cause gout and renal dysfunctions. Thus, hyperuricemic animal models to study urate-induced pathologies are needed. We recently generated mice with liver-specific ablation of Glut 9, a urate transporter providing access of urate to uricase (LG 9 KO mice). LG 9 KO mice had moderately high <b>uricemia</b> (∼ 120 μM). To further increase their <b>uricemia,</b> here we gavaged LG 9 KO mice for 3 days with inosine, a urate precursor; this treatment was applied in both chow- and high-fat-fed mice. In chow-fed LG 9 KO mice, <b>uricemia</b> peaked at 300 μM 2 h {{after the first}} gavage and normalized 24 h after the last gavage. In contrast, in high-fat-fed LG 9 KO mice, <b>uricemia</b> further rose to 500 μM. Plasma creatinine strongly increased, indicating acute renal failure. Kidneys showed tubule dilation, macrophage infiltration, and urate and uric acid crystals, associated with a more acidic urine. Six weeks after inosine gavage, plasma urate and creatinine had normalized. However, renal inflammation, fibrosis, and organ remodeling had developed despite the disappearance of urate and uric acid crystals. Thus, hyperuricemia and high-fat diet feeding combined to induce acute renal failure. Furthermore, a sterile inflammation caused by the initial crystal-induced lesions developed despite the disappearance of urate and uric acid crystals...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The i. v. load of {{fructose}} {{causes a}} significantly higher adenosine triphosphate (ATP) degradation and uric acid production in cirrhotic patients than in healthy controls. Resynthesis of ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) may be facilitated by the phosphorylated compound fructose 1, 6 -diphosphate, which is used as energy support in parenteral nutrition. The aim of our research was to evaluate: 1) The 1 -h uricemic effect of i. v. fructose (0. 5 g/kg body weight) in 10 healthy controls and in 78 patients with differenct stages of non-alcoholic chronic liver damage associated or not with malnutrition or hepatocellular carcinoma; and 2) the effect of fructose 1, 6 -diphosphate (5 g/ 50 ml) administered i. v. after fructose infusion on the induced <b>uricemia</b> in a subgroup of 13 patients with well compensated cirrhosis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The increase of <b>uricemia</b> above the basal level after fructose infusion was significantly higher (p < 0. 01) in cirrhotics (3 mg/dl) than in controls (1. 2 mg/dl) and in patients with chronic hepatitis (1. 9 mg/dl) and was completely reversed by fructose 1, 6 -diphosphate in the patients tested. Neither Child-Pugh classes of cirrhosis nor malnutrition (present in about 50 % of the patients) or hepatocarcinoma significantly affected the fructose-induced <b>uricemia.</b> Therefore, the fructose test efficiently differentiates cirrhotics from chronic hepatitis patients and healthy subjects, {{but it does not}} distinguish the various stages of the progression of cirrhosis or its complications...|$|E

40|$|International audienceObjectives: Hyperuricemia is {{becoming}} increasingly frequent in the population, and is known to besometimes the cause of gout. The impact of uric acid is still not clearly understood, however. The ironmetabolism may interact with the uric acid metabolism. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the relationship between the serum uric acid and serum ferritin levels in a cohort of hemochromatosis patientswho were homozygous for the HFE p. Cys 282 Tyr mutation. Methods: 738 patients with the HFE gene mutation Cys 282 Tyr in the homozygous state were includedin the study. The variables measured during the initial evaluation were compared in univariate analysisby Student's t test. In multivariate analysis, linear stepwise regression was used. Results: In the group of hyperuricemic patients, ferritinemia was significantly higher than in the group ofnonhyperuricemic patients (1576. 7 +/- 1387. 4 mu g/l vs. 1095. 63 +/- 1319. 24 mu g/l, P < 0. 005). With multivariate analysis, only ferritin and BMI independently explained the <b>uricemia</b> (R- 2 = 0. 258) after adjustmentfor age, glycemia and CRP. The correlation between <b>uricemia</b> and log(ferritin) with partial regressioncorrelation coefficients was 0. 307 (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: The increase in <b>uricemia</b> is associated with the increase in ferritin in a population of patientswho were homozygous for the HFE gene mutation p.

40|$|Background. The {{last few}} years have seen an {{increased}} necessity to assess the cardiovascular risk factors on large samples {{of the population in}} Italy. A look at the citizens of a small rural town Brisighella is well known. Methods. Three hundred and five individuals of average age 40. 8 years (+/- 8. 22), recruited between September 1988 and December 1989 (198 men, 107 women) were taken into consideration. Clinical and instrumental investigations were then performed (intern visits with data obtained from primary anthropometric, otorhinolaryngological and ocular variables, heart X-ray, electrocardiogram). The following analyses were also performed: haemochrome, ESR, <b>uricemia,</b> azotemia, glycemia, AST, ALT, bilirubinemia, protein electrophoresis, triglyceridemia, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, creatinine level and urine analysis. Women also received PAP-test. Another variable was lifestyle habits which may be considered a risk for cardiovascular disease. Hygienic and diet suggestions were made. After seven years, in 1997, 100 of these individuals (51 men, 49 women mean age 42. 7 +/- 6. 5 years) were chosen at random and administered the same clinical and laboratory examinations as before. Results. The analysis of the data show average BMI values 24. 07 +/- 2. 7 in men and 22. 8 +/- 2. 6 in women, inferior to those found in other Italian investigations. We observed an increase of BMI along with age, despite measures of preventive medicine, in married subjects and along with education and occupation level. Mean values of cholesterol level in men increased between the ages 30 and 39 and stabilised after 40 years; in women they increased only after the 5 (th) decade of life. Conclusions.

40|$|Introduction Although the {{initiation}} of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) is accompanied by an attenuation of viral load, metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and lipodystrophy are often observed in patients under this treatment. Certain foods, such as oat bran, soy protein, and flaxseed, have been shown to improve a patient's lipid profile despite possible increases in <b>uricemia.</b> Thus, a bioactive compound was formulated using these foods to help patients with HIV/AIDS control metabolic disorders resulting from HAART. Methods An uncontrolled before and after study was performed. The total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and uric acid before and after 3 months of consuming the formulation were compared in patients. The compound was formulated such that 40 g (the recommended daily intake) contained approximately 10 g of flaxseed, 20 g of oat bran, and 10 g of textured soy protein. Results The study population consisted of 139 patients, 31 of whom were included in the final analysis. There were no significant variations between the laboratory results obtained before and after consumption of the compound. Conclusions The regular consumption of the formulation together with individualized dietary guidance did not reduce lipid levels and did not contribute to an increase in <b>uricemia</b> in the study group. However, new studies with higher doses of the foods that compose the formulation should be encouraged to investigate whether these foods can positively influence the lipid profiles of these patients...|$|E

To determine whether higher plasma concentrations of urate predict a re-duced risk of Parkinson’s disease, the authors conducted a nested case-control study among {{participants in the}} Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a cohort comprising over 18, 000 men who provided blood samples in 1993 – 1995. Eighty-four incident cases of Parkinson’s disease were diagnosed through 2000, and each was randomly matched to two controls by year of birth, race, and time of blood collection. Rate ratios of Parkinson’s disease according to quartile of <b>uricemia</b> were estimated by use of conditional logistic regression. The mean urate con-centration was 5. 7 mg/dl among cases and 6. 1 mg/dl among controls (p 0. 01). After adjustment for age, smoking, and caffeine, the rate ratio of Parkinson’s disease for the highest quartile of <b>uricemia</b> compared with the lowest was 0. 43 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 18, 1. 02; ptrend 0. 017). This association was stronger in analyses excluding cases diagnosed within 4 years (median) from blood collection (rate ratio 0. 17, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 04, 0. 69; ptrend 0. 010). These results suggest that high plasma urate concentrations may decrease the risk of Parkinson’s disease, and they raise the possibility that interventions to increase plasma urate may reduce the risk and delay the progression of Parkinson’s disease.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the main factors associated with higher <b>uricemia</b> values analyzing diet, body composition and biochemical markers. Methods 415 both gender individuals aged 21 to 82 years who participated in a lifestyle modification project were studied. Anthropometric evaluation consisted of weight and height measurements with later BMI estimation. Waist circumference was also measured. The muscle mass (Muscle Mass Index – MMI) and fat percentage were measured by bioimpedance. Dietary intake was estimated by 24 -hour recalls with later quantification of the servings on the Brazilian food pyramid and the Healthy Eating Index. Uric acid, glucose, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, urea, creatinine, gamma-GT, albumin and calcium and HDL-c were quantified in serum by the dry-chemistry method. LDL-c was estimated by the Friedewald equation and ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) by the immunochemiluminiscence method. Statistical analysis was performed by the SAS software package, version 9. 1.

METHODS: We studied patients from the Hypertension Unit of the University of Goias who had hyperuricemia (men > or = 8. 5 mg/dL and women > or = 7. 5 mg/dL). We divided the patients into three groups: G 1 (low purine diet), G 2 (low purine diet + medication), and G 3 (medication only). Patients received allopurinol, 150 mg/day titrated up to 300 mg/dL when necessary. Patients were evaluated with regards to their lifestyles (diet, smoking, physical, activity, alcohol consumption), uric acid, blood pressure, use of medication, body mass index, cholesterol, and triglyceride. Follow-up took place in weeks 0 (M 1), 6 (M 2), 12 (M 3) during the intervention and in week 36 (M 4) after the study was completed. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients participated in the study, 31 women, mean age 54. 4 ± 10. 6 years, body mass index 28. 6 ± 3. 9 kg/m². A similar reduction (p< 0. 001) in uric acid levels occurred in the three intervention groups.

40|$|International audienceAccelerated {{coronary}} artery disease develops in {{most if not all}} heart transplant recipients within the first year after transplantation. Increased lipid peroxidation seems to be involved in atherogenesis. In these patients we have investigated whether there is an association between lipid peroxidation, reduced antioxidant defenses, and some conventional coronary risk factors. Lipid peroxides, lipids, uric acid, albumin, antioxidant enzymes and their cofactors (the trace elements selenium, iron, copper, and zinc) have been determined in heart transplant recipients compared with nonrecipients with {{coronary artery}} disease. Lipid peroxides (p = 0. 002) and uric acid (p = 0. 01) were higher and zinc (p = 0. 001) was lower in heart transplant recipients. Thirteen of 30 transplant recipients compared with one of 30 nonrecipients (p < 0. 001) had very low (less than 10 mumol/L) zinc levels. Antioxidant enzymes and other trace elements were not significantly different. In univariate regression analysis, zinc correlated positively with albumin (p = 0. 02) and negatively with lipid peroxides (p < 0. 05). <b>Uricemia</b> had a strongly positive correlation with hydroperoxides (r = 0. 45; p = 0. 0001). In stepwise multivariate regression analysis, lipids, <b>uricemia,</b> creatinine, and zinc were significant (p < or = 0. 004) predictors of the lipid peroxide level. Cyclosporine and corticosteroid dosages were significant (p = 0. 01) determinants of zinc concentration in the transplant recipients. Although a causal relationship between increased lipid peroxidation and accelerated arteriosclerosis is not definitely demonstrated, the results of this analysis suggest new insights into conventional coronary disease risk factors and possible therapeutic interventions; further controlled trials are needed...|$|E

The increase in fiber intake of 10 ± 5 g/day was associated with a decrease of serum uric acid by 69. 87 % from 8. 3  0. 6 mg/dL to 5. 8  0. 5 mg/dL, p = 0. 008, non-significant decrease of BMI (from 26. 8  4. 5 to 26. 4  4. 6 kg/m 2, p< 0. 01), significant decrease of glycemia (from 130  0. 8 to 105  4. 2 mg/dL, p < 0. 001) and significant decrease in blood pressure (from 150  10. 6 to 130  8. 4 mmHg, p < 0. 001). Conclusion: The fiber rich diet decreased blood uric acid, blood glucose levels an arterial pressure in patients with metabolic syndrome...|$|E

In May 2004, dur-ing an outpatient visit, he referred 10 years of recurrent episodes of monoarthritis lasting three days, successively affecting either the left knee, left tarsus, elbow, left or bilateral first metatarsopha-langeal joints, with no other accompanying symptoms. Physical examination showed signs of a left knee effusion, restricting flexion to 90 ◦ and tophi on the left olecranon. Laboratory tests showed <b>uricemia</b> of 9. 4 mg/dl and GGT 166 U/dl. The remaining parameters (CBC, TSH, CPK, rheumatoid factor, HLA B 27, anti-CCP antibodies, immunoglobulins, 24 h urine uric acid) were normal. X-rays of the left foot were performed (Fig. 1), showing marginal erosions and sclerotic borders of the first metatarsal head, with increased adjacent soft tissue.

40|$|Substantial {{evidence}} suggests that chronic hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for hypertension, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular diseases. This highlights the need for greater attention to serum uric acid levels when profiling patients, and suggests that the threshold above which <b>uricemia</b> is considered abnormal is 6 mg/dl, {{in light of the}} available evidence. Another important question is whether lowering serum uric acid can improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes, and what therapeutic mechanism of action could provide more clinical benefits to patients; the available literature shows a trend toward improvement associated with administration of urate-lowering drugs, in particular for the xanthine oxidase inhibitors. The demonstrated efficacy of urate-lowering therapy on outcomes other than gout flares leads to the consideration that treatment may be beneficial {{even in the absence of}} overt gout when hyperuricemia accompanies other clinical conditions, such as urate deposition, advanced CKD or cardiovascular risk factors...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{systemic}} vascular involvement in mediating {{the association between}} serum uric acid (SUA) and renal function in hypertension has not been explored. Main purpose of our {{study was to investigate}} whether morphofunctional vascular changes, assessed as carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), might mediate the association between SUA and renal damage. We enrolled 523 hypertensive subjects with or without chronic kidney disease and divided population into tertiles of SUA based on sex-specific cutoff values. cIMT and aPWV were higher in uppermost SUA-tertile patients when compared to those in the lowest ones (all P <. 001). <b>Uricemia</b> strongly correlated with cIMT and aPWV at univariate analysis (P <. 001) and with cIMT after adjustment for confounders (P <. 001). Adjustment for cIMT attenuated the relationship between SUA and estimated glomerular filtration rate (P =. 019). Systemic vascular changes seem partially to mediate the association between SUA and renal function in hypertensive patients, regardless of kidney function...|$|E
40|$|Abstract High plasma {{uric acid}} (UA) is a precipitating factor for gout and renal calculi {{as well as}} a strong risk factor for Metabolic Syndrome and {{cardiovascular}} disease. The main causes for higher plasma UA are either lower excretion, higher synthesis or both. Higher waist circumference and the BMI are associated with higher insulin resistance and leptin production, and both reduce uric acid excretion. The synthesis of fatty acids (tryglicerides) in the liver is associated with the de novo synthesis of purine, accelerating UA production. The role played by diet on hyperuricemia has not yet been fully clarified, but high intake of fructose-rich industrialized food and high alcohol intake (particularly beer) seem to influence <b>uricemia.</b> It is not known whether UA would be a causal factor or an antioxidant protective response. Most authors do not consider the UA as a risk factor, but presenting antioxidant function. UA contributes to > 50 % of the antioxidant capacity of the blood. There is still no consensus if UA is a protective or a risk factor, however, it seems that acute elevation is a protective factor, whereas chronic elevation a risk for disease. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the differences in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases between men and women participating in the Italy Developing Education and awareness on MicroAlbuminuria in patients with hyperteNsive Disease (I-DEMAND) study. Methods: This is an observational, cross-sectional, multicenter study aimed at assessing prevalence and correlates of CKD among Italian hypertensive patients attending out-patient referral clinics. CKD was defined as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 ml/min per 1. 73 m(2) [Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation] and/or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio of at least 2. 5 mg/mmol in men and of at least 3. 5 mg/mmol in women or both. Left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was diagnosed by either ECG or echocardiography. Results: A total of 3558 study patients with renal data available were considered for this analysis: mean age was 61 +/- 4 years and 37 % had diabetes mellitus. Female patients (n = 1636, 46 %) were older, with a greater prevalence of obesity and lower prevalence of smoking. The prevalence of concomitant coronary artery and peripheral artery diseases, but not of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or heart failure, was lower in women than in men. The overall prevalence of albuminuria (21 vs. 32 %; P = 0. 001) and of microalbuminuria (16 vs. 23 %; P 0. 001) was lower in women than in men. In women the prevalence of a reduced GFR estimated by both MDRD (33 vs. 21 %; P = 0. 001) and CKD-EPI equations (32 vs. 23 %; P = 0. 001) was higher than in men. CKD prevalence was similar in women and men (44 vs. 41 %; P = 0. 095 and 43 vs. 43 %; P = 0. 475, respectively, when MDRD and CKD-EPI eGFR estimations were used). The prevalence of LVH (diagnosed by either ECG or echocardiography) was similar in men and women (18 vs. 20 %; P = 0. 12). The main independent determinants of CKD were age, glycemia, <b>uricemia,</b> pulse pressure, hypertension duration, and previous cardiovascular diseases in men, and increasing age, glycemia, <b>uricemia,</b> pulse pressure, and a lower BMI in women. Conclusion: Renal abnormalities are present in a significant number of female hypertensive patients attending hypertension clinics. Prevalence of reduced eGFR and of microalbuminuria, associated risk factors, and clinical conditions are different between men and women, suggesting the need to develop specific therapeutic strategies to prevent renal dysfunction and reduce associated morbidity and mortality...|$|E

40|$|Objective. Fructose intake from added sugars {{correlates}} with the epidemic rise in metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. However, consumption of beverages containing fructose is allowed during gestation. Recently, {{we found that}} an intake of fructose (10 % wt/vol) throughout gestation produces an impaired fetal leptin signalling. Therefore, we have investigated whether maternal fructose intake produces subsequent changes in their progeny. Methods. Blood samples from fed and 24 [*]h fasted female and male 90 -day-old rats born from fructose-fed, glucose-fed, or control mothers were used. Results. After fasting, HOMA-IR and ISI (estimates of insulin sensitivity) were worse in male descendents from fructose-fed mothers {{in comparison to the}} other two groups, and these findings were also accompanied by a higher leptinemia. Interestingly, plasma AOPP and <b>uricemia</b> (oxidative stress markers) were augmented in male rats from fructose-fed mothers compared to the animals from control or glucose-fed mothers. In contrast, female rats did not show any differences in leptinemia between the three groups. Further, insulin sensitivity was significantly improved in fasted female rats from carbohydrate-fed mothers. In addition, plasma AOPP levels tended to be diminished in female rats from carbohydrate-fed mothers. Conclusion. Maternal fructose intake induces insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, and plasma oxidative stress in male, but not female, progeny...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{estimate}} cardiorenoprotective {{effect of}} 12 -month therapy by indapamide in elderly and senile patients with arterial hypertension (HT) {{and its influence}} on quality of life. Material and methods. 40 elderly and senile patients with HT were examined. 70 % of patients received monotherapy by indapamide 2, 5 mg once daily and 30 % of patients were treated with indapamide and lisinopril combination. Duration of observation was 12 months. Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, echocardiography, plasma lipid profile, glycemia and <b>uricemia</b> levels and potassium serum level was evaluated initially and after 12 months of therapy. Glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria as well as patient quality of life also was evaluated. Results. Target BP level was reached in all patients during 12 month therapy. Reduction of average 24 -hour, day and night BP, BP load, rate of morning BP rising was observed. Negative influence on BP variability was not found. Improvement of daily BP profile also was found. The indapamide reduced left ventricle mass, improved renal function, vessel resistance and quality of life. Negative influence of long-term therapy with indapamide on lipid, glucose, purine metabolism and serum potassium level was not observed. Conclusion. Indapamide is an effective antihypertensive drug for long-term treatment of elderly and senile patients with HT of 1 - 2 degree. </p...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{indicated}} an inverse association between high <b>uricemia</b> and incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD). To investigate the link between endogenous urate and neurotoxic changes involving the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system, this study evaluated the modifications in the striatal urate levels in two models of PD. To this end, a partial dopaminergic degeneration was induced by 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in mice, while a severe dopaminergic degeneration was elicited by unilateral medial forebrain bundle infusion of 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) in rats. Urate levels were measured by in vivo microdialysis at 7 or 14 days from toxin exposure. The results obtained demonstrated higher urate levels in the dopamine-denervated striatum of 6 -OHDA-lesioned rats compared with the intact striatum. Moreover, an inverse correlation between urate and dopamine levels was observed in the same area. In contrast, only a trend to significant increase in striatal urate was observed in MPTP-treated mice. These results demonstrate that a damage to the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system elevates the striatal levels of urate, and suggest {{that this could be}} an endogenous compensatory mechanism to attenuate dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This finding may be important in light of the epidemiological and preclinical evidences that indicate a link between urate and development of P...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} {{to identify}} subgroups of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who have a differential risk of progression of illness and the secondary aim is compare 2 equations to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). To this purpose, the PIRP (Prevention of Progressive Kidney Disease) registry was linked with the dialysis and mortality registries. The outcome of interest is the mean annual variation of GFR, estimated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. A decision tree model was used to subtype CKD patients, based on the non-parametric procedure CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector). The independent variables of the model include gender, age, diabetes, hypertension, cardiac diseases, body mass index, baseline serum creatinine, haemoglobin, proteinuria, LDL cholesterol, tryglycerides, serum phoshates, glycemia, parathyroid hormone and <b>uricemia.</b> The decision tree model classified patients into 10 terminal nodes using 6 variables (gender, age, proteinuria, diabetes, serum phosphates and ischemic cardiac disease) that predict a differential progression of kidney disease. Specifically, age 3. 70 mg/dl predict a faster decrease of GFR, while ischemic cardiac disease predicts a slower decrease. The comparison between GFR estimates obtained using MDRD 4 and CKD-EPI equations shows a high percentage agreement (> 90...|$|E
40|$|Urate is the {{metabolic}} end point of purines in humans. Although supra-physiological plasma urate levels {{are associated with}} obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, a causative role is debated. We previously established a mouse model of hyperuricemia by liver-specific deletion of Glut 9, a urate transporter that provides urate to the hepatocyte enzyme uricase. These LG 9 knockout mice show mild hyperuricemia (120 [*]μmol/l), which can be further increased by the urate precursor inosine. Here, we explored the role of progressive hyperuricemia on the cardiovascular function. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were periodically measured by telemetry over 6 months in LG 9 knockout mice supplemented with incremental amounts of inosine in a normal chow diet. This long-term inosine treatment elicited a progressive increase in <b>uricemia</b> up to 300 [*]μmol/l; however, it did not modify heart rate or mean arterial blood pressure in LG 9 knockout compared with control mice. Inosine treatment did not alter cardiac morphology or function measured by ultrasound echocardiography. However, it did induce mild renal dysfunction as revealed by higher plasma creatinine levels, lower glomerular filtration rate, and histological signs of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, in LG 9 knockout mice, inosine-induced hyperuricemia {{was not associated with}} hypertension despite partial renal deficiency. This does not support a direct role of urate in the control of blood pressure...|$|E
