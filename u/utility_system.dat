25|$|Tacoma's {{relationship}} with public utilities extends back to 1893. At {{that time the}} city was undergoing a boom in population, causing it to exceed the available amount of fresh water supplied by Charles B. Wright's Tacoma Light & Water Company. In response to both this demand and a growing desire to have local public control over the <b>utility</b> <b>system,</b> the city council put up a public vote to acquire and expand the private utility. The measure passed on July 1, 1893, with 3,195 in favor of acquiring the <b>utility</b> <b>system</b> and 1,956 voting against. Since then, Tacoma Public Utilities (TPU) {{has grown from a}} small water and light utility to be the largest department in the city's government, employing about 1,200 people.|$|E
25|$|Stray voltage is {{a result}} of the design of a 4 wire {{distribution}} system and as such has existed as long as such systems have been used. Stray voltage became a problem for the dairy industry some time after electric milking machines were introduced, and large numbers of animals were simultaneously in contact with metal objects grounded to the electric distribution system and the earth. Numerous studies document the causes, physiological effects, and prevention, of stray voltage in the farm environment. Today, stray voltage on farms is regulated by state governments and controlled by the design of equipotential planes in areas where livestock eat, drink or give milk. Commercially available neutral isolators also prevent elevated potentials on the <b>utility</b> <b>system</b> neutral from raising the voltage of farm neutral or ground wires.|$|E
2500|$|Diesel engine {{generator}} sets {{are often used}} for prime power in communities not connected to a widespread power grid.

[...] Standby generators may serve as emergency power for a factory or data center, or may also be operated in parallel with the local <b>utility</b> <b>system</b> to reduce peak power demand charge from the utility. [...] Diesel engines can produce strong torque at relatively low rotational speeds, which is generally desirable when driving an alternator, but diesel fuel in long-term storage can be subject to problems resulting from water accumulation and chemical decomposition.

2500|$|By {{the time}} North Louisiana Telephone Company had been sold, Couch was already {{exploring}} {{the possibilities of}} developing a similar interconnected electric <b>utility</b> <b>system.</b> [...] Both Malvern and Arkadelphia had awarded franchises for citywide electric utilities, and in both cities, the utility companies were in decline, and only provided night-time service. [...] Couch proposed a partnership with Arkansas Land & Lumber Company, a large sawmill operation in Malvern, whereby sawdust and waste material purchased from the sawmill {{would be used to}} fuel boilers, producing steam for two 550-kilowatt turbines to generate electric power. [...] The new system, a predecessor of Arkansas Power and Light Company (AP), became operational on 18 December 1914, providing Malvern and Arkadelphia with 24-hour electric service for the first time. [...] In 1916, AP's second generating plant opened in Russellville, seat of Pope County in north-central Arkansas. The plant was adjacent to a coal field which provided a steady supply of fuel. Under leadership of Couch, AP continued purchasing city utility systems and building electric transmission lines throughout Arkansas.|$|E

[...] During his administration, large public works projects were launched, including the construction of the Los Angeles City Hall, the Central Library (built at a cost of $2.3 million), the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and the Mulholland Highway. [...] Cryer delivered the opening address and welcome the opening ceremony for the Coliseum on Armistice Day in 1923, and he led a parade of floats from the countries of the world as part of a ceremony marking the dedication of City Hall. [...] The city also expanded its municipal-owned public <b>utility</b> <b>system</b> (the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power), and Cryer was instrumental in the passage of the legislation that provided for the construction of the Hoover Dam and All-American Canal, providing water and electricity to Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|A Fitch {{business}} {{report for}} Princeton, dated October 9, 2012 is titled: [...] "Fitch Affirms Princeton, Texas GOs and COs [...] at 'A-'; Outlook Negative." [...] The key rating drivers for the negative outlook are Princeton's diminished reserves, increased tax rates, slowed tax base growth, above average debt, and the city's inability to replenish unrestricted general fund balances to levels that provide adequate operating flexibility and financial cushion. [...] The negative outlook reflects {{the trend of}} operating deficits in recent years, culminating in a negative general fund balance {{at the close of}} fiscal 2011. [...] The fiscal 2011 net deficit was $4.2 million. [...] The fiscal 2013 budget includes an increased ad valorem tax rate to increase funding for maintenance and operations; increased water service rates are also included in the budget. [...] Fitch notes the city's ad valorem tax rate is above average for Texas municipalities. [...] Overall debt is above average at 5.2% of market value despite state support for overlapping school district debt and support for direct city debt by the <b>utility</b> <b>system.</b> [...] GO debt amortization remains below average with 36.8% of principal scheduled for repayment within 10 years.

40|$|In December 1997, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued Defense Reform Initiative Directive # 9 {{directing}} the Military Departments {{to develop a}} plan for privatizing all <b>utility</b> <b>systems</b> except those needed for unique security reasons or when privatization is uneconomical. The utilities privatization program is designed to get DoD out of the business of owning, operating and maintaining <b>utility</b> <b>systems.</b> DoD consumes 70 percent of all the energy consumed by the federal government. This costs DoD nearly $ 6 -billion a year, with $ 2. 4 - billion of that in infrastructure maintenance. Privatization of DoD <b>utility</b> <b>systems</b> can generate an estimated savings of $ 327 - million annually in reduced infrastructure costs. These savings can be reallocated to DoD's core competencies: warfighting and warfighting support. This thesis analyzed two case studies to help identify emerging problems facing utilities privatization in the Navy and determine their impact to the ongoing implementation process. Three major problems were identified: (1) variance in determination of Fair Market Value, (2) variance in economic analyses, and (3) applicability of State Utility Commissions' authority over <b>utility</b> <b>systems</b> located on DoD installations.
