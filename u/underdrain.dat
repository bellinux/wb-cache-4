25|$|Sand {{filters are}} a {{variation}} of the infiltration trench principle and operate in a way similar to bioretention systems. Stormwater is passed through them for treatment prior to discharge to the downstream stormwater system. Sand filters are very useful in treating runoff from confined hard surfaces such as car parks and from heavily urbanised and built-up areas. They usually do not support vegetation owing to the filtration media (sand) not retaining sufficient moisture and because they are usually installed underground. The filter usually consists of a sedimentation chamber as pre-treatment device to remove litter, debris, gross pollutants and medium-sized sediments; a weir; followed by a sand layer that filters sediments, finer particulates and dissolved pollutants. The filtered water is collected by perforated <b>underdrain</b> pipes in a similar manner as in bioretention systems. Systems may also have an overflow chamber. The sedimentation chamber can have permanent water or can be designed to be drained with weep holes between storm events. Permanent water storage however, can risk anaerobic conditions that can lead to the release of pollutants (e.g. phosphorus). The design process should consider the provision of detention storage to yield a high hydrologic effectiveness, and discharge control by proper sizing of the perforated <b>underdrain</b> and overflow path. Regular maintenance is required to prevent crust forming.|$|E

40|$|Abstract approved: Meghna Babbar-Sebens Bioretention is {{a common}} form of green {{stormwater}} infrastructure {{that is used to}} attenuate peak flows from urban stormwater. Previous research shows that the bioretention peak response is not consistent across time or space and that the variables that affect peak hydrology are numerous. One variable that has not been well studied is bioretention establishment, or the indefinite period of time following installation during which the soils and plants mature until stabilization of hydrologic performance is achieved. Previous research has investigated changes in infiltration rate, but the peak flow response to this change in infiltration has not been quantified. The primary objective of this research was to characterize bioretention establishment peak hydrology. The runoff from a 9, 300 m 2 drainage area was captured by a grey-green stormwater treatment train using an underground storage tank, a pump, and three parallel bioretention cells with <b>underdrains.</b> One of the cells was monitored for peak flows analysis from October 2014 to May 2015...|$|R

Integrated modelling for 1981 – 99 substantiates a 30 % uphill increase in average net recharge, caused by the reduction in capillary rise when the water table declines. Calibration of the groundwater module is constrained by stream flow separation and water table wells. Net recharge and a priori parameterisation has been estimated from those same data, an automatic rain gauge and electrical sounding. Evaluation of snow storage and compensation for a simplified formulation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity contribute to a modelling of the precipitation-runoff relation that compares well with measurements in other <b>underdrained</b> clayey catchments.

5000|$|When an area’s {{soils are}} not {{permeable}} {{enough to allow}} water to drain and filter properly, the soil should be replaced and an <b>underdrain</b> installed. This bioretention mixture should typically contain 60% sand, 20% compost, and 20% topsoil, {{and there is a}} current trend to replace compost with biochar. Existing soil must be removed and replaced. Do not combine the sandy soil (bioretention) mixture with a surrounding soil that does not have high sand content. Otherwise, the clay particles will settle in between the sand particles and form a concrete-like substance, as demonstrated in a 1983 study. Deep plant roots also create additional channels for storm water to filter into the ground. Microbial populations feed off plant root secretions and break down carbon (such as in mulch or desiccated plant roots) to aggregate soil particles which increases infiltration rates. A five-year study by the U.S. Geological Survey indicates that rain gardens in urban clay soils can be effective without the use of underdrains or replacement of native soils with the bioretention mix.

Previous research has shown that water leaving bioretention systems via the <b>underdrains</b> often continued for several days at low velocities following a precipitation event.

Results indicate that there is no statistical difference between flow rates in streams draining undeveloped watersheds and bioretention outflow rates for the first 24 hours following the commencement of flow. Similarly, there is no statistical difference between the cumulative volumes released by the two systems during the 48 hours following the start of flow. These results indicate that bioretention cells behave comparably to watersheds in natural or non-urban conditions with respect to both flow rates and flow volumes and suggest that bioretention outflows may mirror post storm event shallow groundwater inter-event stream recharge flow...|$|R

40|$|Simultaneous field {{monitoring}} of runoff and suspended sediment loads from a 30 ha, artificially-drained, mixed-agricultural catchment in Herefordshire, UK indicates field drains are the dominant pathway {{for the transfer}} of runoff and sediment to the stream. Surface runoff pathways draining 6 · 2 % of the catchment area transported around 1 % of the catchment sediment load, while subsurface runoff in field drains draining 26 · 5 % of the catchment transported around 24 % of the sediment load. The explanations offered here for the dominance of drainflow - the spatial limitation of surface runoff generation and low hillslope-stream connectivity of surface runoff compared with subsurface runoff - {{are also likely to}} apply to other artificially-drained lowland agricultural catchments in the UK.

40|$|Rapid Infiltration (RI), {{which is}} also known as soil aquifer {{treatment}}, is one of the three major land treatment techniques that uses the soil ecosystem to treat wastewater. However, the RI process can treat a much larger volume of wastewater on a much smaller land area than other land treatment concepts. In RI systems, wastewater is applied to shallow basins constructed in deep and permeable deposits of highly porous soils. Wastewater application can be by flooding, or occasionally by sprinklers. Treatment, including filtration, adsorption, ion exchange, precipitation, and microbial action, occurs as the wastewater moves through the soil matrix. Phosphorus and most metals are retained in the soil while toxic organics are degraded or adsorbed. any adverse impact on the adjacent groundwater. It is also possible to use special management approaches that maximize the nitrification and denitrification reactions, or to recycle the portion of the percolate with the highest nitrate concentration. APPLICABILITY RI is a simple and low cost wastewater treatment concept that has been used for more than 100 years. It is applicable for either primary or secondary effluent, and it has been used for treating municipal and some industrial wastewaters. Industries which have successfully used RI to treat their wastewater As wastewater percolates through the soil, it can be collected, or it can flow to native surface water or groundwater aquifers. Where the groundwater table is relatively shallow, the use of <b>underdrains</b> allows control of groundwater mounding and recovery of the renovated water.
