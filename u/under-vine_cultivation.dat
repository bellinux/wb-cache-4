40|$|A {{new system}} for <b>under-vine</b> <b>cultivation</b> (SIEGWALD HS 1200) was tested {{over a period}} of two years in four farms with organic {{viticulture}} and compared with their customary systems. The SIEGWALD system has well proved its worth. The total costs were comparable to those of other systems. All tractors met the requirements of the SIEGWALD system. Vine trunks were not injured, except in one vineyard. Negative consequences for the fauna on the soil surface and for predatory mites (Typhlodromus pyri) in the canopy were not found. ...|$|E
40|$|This conference {{represents}} {{a continuation of}} previous meetings and is intended to bring together active researchers and advisers involved in organic fruit growing to discuss latest results and methods. The main object is the coordination of research and to organize joint research projects. The official language of the workshop is English. Contributions are possible in English and German. Oral presentations will be simultaneously translated to English.
