Management of {{the quantity and quality of}} <b>urban</b> stormwater <b>run-off</b> is a major concern for government authorities. The increase in impervious surfaces associated with urbanisation of catchments results in an increase in the volumes of stormwater runoff that must be handled by the stormwater drainage systems and a consequent increase in the ability of the stormwater runoff to transport pollutants from the catchment surface to the downstream receiving waters. These pollutants include those from vehicle exhausts, brakes and tyres, community activities, and atmospheric deposition.

30|$|One major {{challenge}} in calculating {{the growth and}} decay of pathogens in ambient water is that the inactivation rates of bacteria are system specific i.e., changes with water/environment conditions (Noble et al. 2004). As an example, the survival of bacteria, such as Enterococcus, is suggested to be longer than E. coli in freshwater, and the decay rates of Salmonella were higher than Enterococcus in coastal water (Craig et al. 2003; Haller et al. 2009). Compared to Salmonella, the survival of E. coli {{was found to be}} higher in estuaries (Chandran and Hatha 2005). While comparing survival of indicator microorganisms in aquatic systems, studies also showed that the survival of bacteria was not dependent upon the original source of contamination. For instance, the results of an inactivation study of indicator micro-organisms sourced from sewage influent, sewage effluent, and <b>urban</b> storm drain <b>run-off,</b> showed that the survival of indicator bacteria was similar in fresh and sea water.

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} human {{viral contamination}} in urban rivers {{and its impact}} on coastal waters of southern California, USA. Methods and Results: Three types of human viruses (adeno, entero and hepatitis A) were detected using nested- and RT-PCR from 11 rivers and creeks. Faecal indicator bacteria as well as somatic and F-specific coliphage were also tested. Approximately 50 % of the sites were positive for human adenoviruses. However, there was no clear relationship between detection of human viruses and the concentration of indicator bacteria and coliphage. Both faecal indicator bacteria and human viral input at beaches near river mouths were associated with storm events. The first storm of the wet season seemed to have the greatest impact on the quality of coastal water than following storm events. Conclusions: This study provides the first direct evidence that human viruses are prevalent in southern California urban rivers. <b>Urban</b> <b>run-off</b> impacts coastal water quality most significantly during the storm season.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of properties and processes of running waters {{is a major}} issue in aquatic environmental management. Because system analysis and prediction with deterministic and stochastic models is often limited by the complexity and dynamic nature of these ecosystems, supplementary or alternative methods have to be developed. We tested the suitability of various types of artificial neural networks for system analysis and impact assessment in different fields: (1) temporal dynamics of water quality based on weather, <b>urban</b> storm-water <b>run-off</b> and waste-water effluents; (2) bioindication of chemical and hydromorphological properties using benthic macroinvertebrates; and (3) long-term population dynamics of aquatic insects. Specific pre-processing methods and neural models were developed to assess relations among complex variables with high levels of significance. For example, the diurnal variation of oxygen concentration (modelled from precipitation and oxygen of the preceding day; R 2 = 0. 79), population dynamics of emerging aquatic insects (modelled from discharge, water temperature and abundance of the parental generation; R 2 = 0. 93), and water quality and habitat characteristics as indicated by selected sensitive benthic organisms (e. g. R 2 = 0. 83 for pH and R 2 = 0. 82 for diversity of substrate, using five out of 248 species). Our results demonstrate that neural networks and modelling techniques can conveniently be applied to the above mentioned fields because of their specific features compared with classical methods. Particularly, they can be used to reduce the complexity of data sets by identifying important (functional) inter-relationships and key variables. Thus, complex systems can be reasonably simplified in clear models with low measuring and computing effort. This allows new insights about functional relationships of ecosystems with the potential to improve the {{assessment of}} complex impact factors and ecological predictions...|$|R

A pair of magnets, each with 0. 7 T magnetic charge density, was installed around the column. The particle size of the iron oxide was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.
