40|$|New school {{accountability}} policy alters how {{the state}} department of education (SDE) and <b>underperforming</b> <b>school</b> interact by creating a direct connection between the two. The 2 ̆ 2 beginning of intervention 2 ̆ 2 is when the SDE and the <b>underperforming</b> <b>school</b> commence their working relationship. Challenges {{to the development of a}} relationship include limited capacity at the SDE level and the local educators 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of new school accountability as a deterrent policy. The working relationship is the vehicle for bridging the state 2 ̆ 7 s externally imposed and school 2 ̆ 7 s internally pre-existing accountability systems; to negotiate the implementation of the policy for the dual purpose of making sense of the policy for the school and the SDE and meeting the end goal of the policy by improving the educational outcomes of the school; and to alter educators 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of new school accountability policy from that of a deterrent and threatening policy to one which is enabling and empowering of local educators. Document analysis, observations, and interviews of Massachusetts state education administrators, local district administrators and <b>underperforming</b> <b>school</b> educators were used to gain an understanding of {{how the state}} and local levels perceive one another during intervention. Results from the qualitative study were analyzed using Scheberle 2 ̆ 7 s (1997) 2 ̆ 2 Working Relationship Typology 2 ̆ 2 which uses trust and involvement levels as variables to determine the type of working relationship between organizations. Findings indicate that the working relationship between the SDE and the school improves during the beginning of intervention, but remains distant. The surprising finding is that the district is seen as the key lever for improvement by those in the <b>underperforming</b> <b>school</b> and SDE. The existing relationship between the district and school, however, was negative, as the elementary school educators blamed the district for neglecting their schools. Giving the district capacity to facilitate school improvement, the SDE designed a system of early intervention that places a 2 ̆ 2 fixer 2 ̆ 2 (Bardach, 1977) at the district level whose sole purpose is to work with underperforming schools. The findings indicate that this contributed to dramatic improvement in the working relationship between the district and the <b>underperforming</b> <b>school</b> as well as the relationship between the SDE and the district. ...|$|E

This {{analytic}} autoethnographic study highlights leadership {{practices of}} a principal {{in a high}} poverty school that has undergone transformation in the school culture {{over the course of}} nine years (2003 - 2012). The problem addressed by this study is that few low achieving schools have effectively undergone sustainable transformations; in addition, there is very little research on long-term sustainability practices in high poverty schools that have undergone transformations. The critical question here is: How does a principal transform an <b>underperforming</b> <b>school</b> in the era of accountability while keeping staff morale high?

40|$|Currently, California {{education}} leaders {{face the}} task of implementing and sustaining proven practices that increase student achievement. Teachers {{who are able to}} sustain change in their classroom practices possess purpose for the cause for improving student learning, passion for implementing quality instruction, and conviction to stay focused over extended time. Principals who sustain reform efforts lead schools with vibrant climates and cultures that exhibit these qualities. This paper reports on how these three traits were used in transforming Lee Richmond School, California, from an <b>underperforming</b> <b>school</b> into an example of educational success. A core leadership team for instruction was established that promoted a sense of purpose in the faculty. The principal, in becoming teacher, learner, and coach, helped instill a sense of passion in the faculty that their work matters and that, as their expertise increases, so the importance of their work. By encouraging reflective conversations among the faculty, the principal helped bolster the conviction that their reforms were taking effect. By making purpose, passion, and conviction permanent parts of the school culture, the school's reform efforts were ensured.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{understand}} and compare two schools in relation to how effective leadership functions (instructional and transformational leadership) may have been utilized to arrive at differential academic outputs in schools. Towards this end, an exceptionally performing and under-performing school was chosen from within the same socio-economic context with a view to understand how instructional and transformational leadership could result in generating optimal academic performance. These selected schools are government owned and thus, receive similar treatment in terms of funding, control, commitment, management and control, etc. Therefore a major research question: How do selected leadership functions bring about generation of differential student’s exceptional academic performance in schools? Utilizing the qualitative research approach, data was collected from internal key role players (otherwise referred to School Leadership Team [SLT]) from two selected schools: one exceptional performing and the other, underperforming. Participants in the study are; Principals, Vice-principals and Heads of Department (HODs) from the two schools. I utilised one-on-one semi-structured interview, observations and document review to obtain rich data towards providing answers to the puzzle of the study. Findings among others indicate that monitoring, modelling, and internally funded training and development of teachers, ensured effective instructional delivery and up-date of knowledge in the teaching skills; and subject knowledge update of teachers in the exceptionally performing school, which impacted on student’s performance in the exceptionally performing school, compared to the exceptionally <b>underperforming</b> <b>school...</b>|$|E

An additional requirement was one that identified schools that would undertake a process to become accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. ^ Using case study methodology, this study seeks to address this question: To what extent has one identified <b>underperforming</b> <b>school</b> implemented comprehensive reform strategies, and how did organizational capacity serve as a mediating feature in the implementation of those strategies? ^ Data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, non-participant observation, and document analysis centering on the implementation process.

Specifically, some studies argue that these systems, and their emphasis on high-stakes testing, have become especially detrimental to the Latino student population. Most of the scholarly literature focusing on the link between Latino dropouts and high-stakes testing consists of either case studies (limiting the number of students in the analysis) or quantitative studies that have found the effect of testing on the dropout rate to be much less than is expected. In the case of these quantitative studies, many of the scholars have argued that the unexpectedly weak statistical relationship {{can be attributed to the}} indirect effects of testing on other issues, such as grade retention, over-enforcement of disciplinary standards, limited English proficiency exemptions, and academic tracking – all of which have been found to lead to increased dropout rates. 3 Previous Work on Testing and Dropouts The most common objection to high-stakes testing lies in the argument that testing negatively affects minority students, more so than their Anglo counterpart...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} role of {{principal}} leadership in creating a thinking school. It contributes to the school leadership literature by exploring the intersection of two important areas of study in education - school leadership and education for thinking - which is a particularly apt area of study, because effective school leadership is crucial if students are {{to learn to be}} critical and creative thinkers, yet this connection has not be widely investigated. We describe how one principal, Hinton, turned around an <b>underperforming</b> <b>school</b> by using critical and creative philosophical thinking as the focus for students, staff and parents. Then, drawing on the school leadership literature, the article describes seven attributes of school leadership beginning with four articulated by Leithwood and colleagues (2006) (building vision and setting direction; redesigning the organisation; understanding and developing people; managing the teaching and learning program), and adding three others (influence; self-development; and responding to context). This framework is then used in a case study format in a collaboration between practitioner and researchers to first explore evidence from empirical studies and personal reflection about Hinton's leadership of Buranda State School, and second to illuminate how these general features of school leadership apply to creating a thinking school. Based on the case study and using the general characteristics of school leadership, a framework for leading a thinking school is described. Because the framework is based on a turnaround school, this framework has wide applicability: to schools that are doing well as an indication of how to implement a contemporary approach to curriculum and pedagogy; and to schools that are underperforming and want a rigorous, high expectation and contemporary way to improve student learning...|$|E

40|$|Research on {{learning}} to teach mathematics reveals that mathematics teaching {{is a complex}} process (Lerman, 2000) and classroom teaching and learning is a “multifaceted, extraordinarily complex phenomenon” (O’Connor, 1998, p. 43). Moreover, research reveals that the mathematics reform agenda has {{had an impact on}} what happens in the mathematics classroom, however, the impact has been superficial (Kazemi 2 ̆ 6 Stipek, 2001) with teachers often retaining their pre-reform habits and attitudes in regards to mathematics teaching and learning (O’Connor, 1998). This study examined the reform discourse practices that three novice teachers, who had been enrolled in a reform based methods course during their preservice teacher education program, adopted, adapted, or ignored as they attempted to engage students in mathematical conversations. Data sources included interviews, field notes, artifacts, and transcripts of videotaped classroom lessons. The primary research questions guiding this study included: (1) What reform-oriented discourses practices do novice teachers, who participated in a reform-based mathematics methods course adopt? What practices do they adapt? What practices do they ignore as they engage students in mathematics conversations? and (2) What issues and challenges surface as novice teachers begin to enact reform-oriented discourse practices? Results indicated that despite holding beliefs that reflect the basic tenets of mathematics reform, theses novice teachers represent a continuum of practices ranging from traditional to reform. Evidence suggests that adopting the reform-oriented practice of eliciting different solutions was critical in the development of social norms that reflect mathematics reform. Eliciting different solutions served to focus classroom conversations on meaningful student generated explanations and justifications. Moreover, evidence suggests that enacting the practice of eliciting different solutions was instrumental in enacting other reform-orientated practices associated with the development of reform-oriented socialmathematical norms. Lastly, results indicate that the pressures of teaching in an <b>underperforming</b> <b>school,</b> as defined by state standardized high stakes tests, can impact a novice teacher’s ability and willingness to adopt mathematics reform practices. ...|$|E
40|$|This ethnographic multi-year study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} federal and state education policies in language-minority school children’s in Western Massachusetts. Specifically, it explores, how, in an increasingly English Only era, a Latina kindergarten teacher resists Massachusetts 2 ̆ 7 restrictive bilingual education law {{at the same time that}} she builds on her students’ multi-ethnic identity. Methodologically, this study combines ethnographic and discourse analysis methods and techniques analyzing the curricular effects that the NCLB and the state of Massachusetts language policy have on an <b>underperforming</b> <b>school</b> serving a predominantly Latino/a population. The focus of the study is the literacy practices enacted by a Dominican kindergarten teacher, and her students during the language arts block throughout the year. The data analysis indicates that, despite Mrs. Dominguez’s obligation to comply with the national and state mandated curriculum and regulations, she challenges and questions such policies. By making culturally relevant and pedagogically grounded curricular changes, she was able to provide her students with their home language support (i. e. Spanish) and culturally relevant content that benefited her students’ English literacy development and thus, their own cultural identity formation. These changes were informed by her ongoing professional development provided through a master’s program, as well as her genuine interest in caring for her students’ cultural and linguistic background. Regardless of the state’s language policy restricting the student’s home language use in the classroom, Mrs. Dominguez made use of Spanish, both, to mediate her teaching practices and student’s second language development process, as well as to validate her student’s home language and culture. This study unveils the lived complexities in one kindergarten classroom and how their participants contributed to each other’s identity formation. By emphasizing the importance of mediating their second language acquisition development, the participants in this classroom make use of their translanguaging ability (García 2 ̆ 6 Wei, 2014), which requires high social and mental cognitive abilities in order to communicate effectively.

[...] School of Education and Henry W. Bloch School of Management. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2014 This dissertation examined {{the role of}} school-based college planning guidance services in the college trajectories of central city students of color. It is projected that by 2018, most jobs will require some postsecondary training beyond high school, placing almost 60 million Americans {{at risk of being}} locked out of the middle class because of limited educational attainments. Thus, college guidance services become critical for disenfranchised students who may require greater technical assistance and support to access college. To explore the role of school-based college planning guidance services, this dissertation examined the college planning experiences of students of color enrolled at two distinct urban public high schools in a Midwestern community plagued with longstanding traditions of disenfranchisement resulting from decades of segregated schools and communities. This case study utilized a critical approach through the lens of critical race theory, heuristic inquiry, and narratology to capture the essence of the college planning experiences as expressed by African American high school seniors, parents, and recent graduates affiliated with two central city public schools, each notorious for the highest and lowest rates of college placement amongst its graduates. The case studies of 8 high school seniors within two distinct school cultures within the same neighborhood, served as illustrations of the inequitable provision of college planning guidance in place to equip urban students of color to compete with their suburban peers without equal college planning exposure or supports. <b>Underperforming</b> <b>school</b> systems must examine their role and assume full accountability for ineffective services that contribute to the economic and academic disenfranchisement of students of color. The perpetuation of limited access to higher education is critically detrimental for urban students relegated to neighborhood schools without the means for economic mobility.
