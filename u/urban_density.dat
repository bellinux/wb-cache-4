5|$|Various {{forms of}} Chinese {{architecture}} exist throughout Indonesia with marked differences between {{urban and rural}} areas and among the different islands. Architectural developments by the Chinese in Southeast Asia differ from those in mainland China. By blending local and European (Dutch) design patterns, numerous variations of fusion styles emerged. Chinese architecture in Indonesia has manifested in three forms: religious temples, study halls, and houses. Cities during the colonial period were divided into three racial districts: European, oriental (Arabs, Chinese, and other Asians), and indigenous. There usually were no physical boundaries among the zones, except for rivers, walls, or roads in some cases. Such legal boundaries promoted high growths in <b>urban</b> <b>density</b> within each zone, especially in the Chinese quarters, often leading to poor environmental conditions.|$|E

Its <b>urban</b> <b>density</b> is relatively high for Australia, {{with the majority}} of the area's dwellings being a mixture of mainly post-war low-rise flats (apartment blocks) and Federation-era detached houses. Amongst these are a number of grand Victorian buildings that offer a hint of Ashfield's rich cultural heritage.|$|E

30|$|From the {{presented}} examples it {{is clear}} that <b>urban</b> <b>densities</b> must remain within a sustainable range. If density is too low, it must be allowed to increase, and if it is too high, it must be allowed to decline, to arrive at an appropriate ‘quality density’. However, most of the time, densities are too low in cities around the world and declining, and there is now a concern shared by urban experts worldwide: a concern about declining <b>urban</b> <b>densities</b> in cities globally, exacerbating urban challenges such as sprawl and traffic congestion.|$|R
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{that there is a}} strong inverse {{correlation}} between <b>urban</b> population <b>density</b> and energy consumption per capita, and that public transport could facilitate increased <b>urban</b> population <b>densities,</b> and thus reduce travel distances and fossil fuel consumption.|$|R
25|$|The inner western suburbs include Balmain, {{which was}} once a working class {{industrial}} and mining town but has undergone extensive gentrification, and Ashfield, which has <b>urban</b> <b>density</b> relatively high for Australia.

25|$|In the United States, {{suburban}} infrastructure evolved {{during an}} age of relatively easy access to fossil fuels, {{which has led to}} transportation-dependent systems of living. Zoning reforms that allow greater <b>urban</b> <b>density</b> as well as designs for walking and bicycling can greatly reduce energy consumed for transportation. The use of telecommuting by major corporations is a significant opportunity to conserve energy, as many Americans now work in service jobs that enable them to work from home instead of commuting to work each day.|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} {{construction of}} public swimming pools from the 1970s gave Singapore the highest density of public pools {{per unit area}} in the world. Coupled {{with the emergence of}} many shopping centres, this increased the number of conducive spaces for gay cruising. The growing population, size and <b>urban</b> <b>density</b> of the city created opportunities for anonymous gay encounters even as it raised the risk of discovery by others and hence the number of public complaints about gay cruising and/or public sex, a factor which led to the phenomenon of police entrapment more than a decade later.|$|E
25|$|With {{significant}} sprawl {{occurring in}} the following decades, public transport {{became more and more}} influenced by the decentralised, relatively low-density urban area, where private motor vehicle transport outpaced public transport. However, the growth of the city and of car use have led to serious traffic problems, which, together with the lack of good public transport, have been cited by many Aucklanders as one of the strongest negative factors in living there. Since car usage costs fall slightly with decreasing <b>urban</b> <b>density</b> while public transport costs rise sharply (even for less capital-intensive services like buses), Auckland's public transport will for the foreseeable future have to cope with a handicap compared to cities of similar population but higher density.|$|E
5000|$|Recycling: <b>urban</b> <b>densities</b> are an {{advantage}} as they produce a sufficient volume of collected waste to support economically-viable urban recycling systems where waste is segregated by collection operatives, {{not in the}} home.

25|$|SkyTrain {{has had a}} {{significant}} impact on the development of areas near stations, and has helped to shape <b>urban</b> <b>density</b> in Metro Vancouver. Between 1991 and 2001, the population living within 500 m of SkyTrain increased by 37 per cent, compared to the regional average of 24 per cent. Since SkyTrain opened, the total population of the service area rose from 400,000 to 1.3 million people. According to BC Transit's document SkyTrain: A catalyst for development, more than $5 billion of private money had been invested within a 10–15 minute walking distance of the SkyTrain and SeaBus. The report claimed that the two modes of transportation were the driving force of the investment, though it did not disaggregate the general growth in that area.|$|E
25|$|As {{a growing}} urban area, Ithaca is facing steady {{increases}} {{in levels of}} vehicular traffic on the city grid and on the state highways. Outlying areas have limited bus service, and many people consider a car essential. However, many consider Ithaca a walkable and bikeable community. One positive trend {{for the health of}} downtown Ithaca is the new wave of increasing <b>urban</b> <b>density</b> in and around the Ithaca Commons. Because the downtown area is the region's central business district, dense mixed-use development that includes housing may increase the proportion of people who can walk to work and recreation, and mitigate the likely increased pressure on already busy roads as Ithaca grows. The downtown area is also the area best served by frequent public transportation. Still, traffic congestion around the Commons is likely to progressively increase.|$|E
25|$|The {{cities and}} {{nations that have}} {{invested}} most heavily in car-based transport systems are now the least environmentally sustainable, as measured by per capita fossil fuel use. The social and economic sustainability of car-based transportation engineering has also been questioned. Within the United States, residents of sprawling cities make more frequent and longer car trips, while residents of traditional urban neighbourhoods make a similar number of trips, but travel shorter distances and walk, cycle and use transit more often. It has been calculated that New York residents save $19 billion each year simply by owning fewer cars and driving less than the average American. A less car intensive means of urban transport is carsharing, which is becoming popular in North America and Europe, and according to The Economist, carsharing can reduce car ownership at an estimated rate of one rental car replacing 15 owned vehicles. Car sharing has also begun in the developing world, where traffic and <b>urban</b> <b>density</b> is often worse than in developed countries. Companies like Zoom in India, eHi in China, and Carrot in Mexico, are bringing car-sharing to developing countries {{in an effort to}} reduce car-related pollution, ameliorate traffic, and expand {{the number of people who}} have access to cars.|$|E

500|$|Prior to European settlement, the {{watershed}} was heavily forested {{and was used}} by Native Americans of the Chinook band for fishing and hunting. In the 19thcentury, white settlers cleared much of the land for farming, and the stream is named {{for one of these}} newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 built a water-powered sawmill along the creek. By the early 20thcentury, a rail line parallel to the stream encouraged further residential and commercial development. As <b>urban</b> <b>density</b> increased in the floodplain, seasonal floods grew more damaging. In the 1930s the Works Progress Administration of the federal government lined the lower [...] of Johnson Creek with rock to control the floods. Despite this, the creek flooded 37times between 1941 and 2006. Since the 1990s, regional planners have tried to reduce flooding by controlling stormwater runoff, creating stream meanders, reducing erosion, replacing impervious surfaces, and protecting riparian buffers.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the [...] "Downtown Kendall Urban Center District ordinance" [...] from 1998 {{that allowed the}} area of unincorporated Kendall known as Dadeland to grow into a de facto edge city was {{in part due to}} its {{location}} adjacent to the inter-built Dadeland South Metrorail station and Datran Center. The Datran Center was built as a joint development between its private developer and Miami-Dade Transit. The Loft/The Loft 2 and Centro Lofts are two relatively large buildings that were allowed exemptions to parking requirements due to copious transit access. The Loft 2 is built directly over the First Street Metromover station while Centro Lofts is surrounded by the Metromover's downtown loop in addition to having an arrangement with the local Car2Go service. Due to the <b>urban</b> <b>density,</b> high-rises, cultural institutions, and access to various transit services, Downtown and Brickell are often compared to New York City, specifically Manhattan, despite being much smaller.|$|E
40|$|For {{at least}} two decades, urban policy in Australia {{has been based on}} the belief that high levels of car use and poor public {{transport}} are mainly the result of low <b>urban</b> <b>densities.</b> There has been considerable debate about the evidence on which these policies are based, but until recently there has been no common data-set that allows densities and transport patterns to be compared on a consistent and rigorous basis. As a result of recent changes to data collection and publication systems by the Australian, Canadian and United States national census agencies, it is now possible to compare <b>urban</b> <b>densities</b> and transport mode shares (for the journey to work) across the three countries&# 039; urban areas on a consistent basis. This paper presents the results of this comparison. Australian cities have similar densities to those of Canadian cities and the more densely-populated US cities. There are variations in density among cities, but these show little or no relationship to transport modes share, which seems more closely related to different transport policies. These findings are very different from those on which current urban policies are based, and suggest the need for a radical rethinking of those policies...|$|R
