40|$|We {{investigate}} the accuracy provided by different treatments {{of the exchange}} and correlation effects, in particular the London dispersion forces, on the properties of liquid water using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with density functional theory. The lack of London dispersion forces in generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) is remedied by means of dispersion-corrected atom-centered potentials (DCACPs) or damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the C 6 R- 6 form. We compare results from simulations using GGA density functionals (BLYP, PBE, and revPBE) with data from their van der Waals (vdW) corrected counterparts. As pointed out previously, all vdW-corrected BLYP simulations give rise to highly mobile water whose softened structure is closer to experimental data than the one predicted by the bare BLYP functional. Including vdW interactions in the PBE functional, on the other hand, has little influence on both structural and dynamical properties of water. Augmenting the revPBE functional with either damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections or DCACP evokes opposite behaviors. The former further softens the already <b>under-structured</b> revPBE water, whereas the latter makes it more glassy. These results demonstrate the delicacy needed in describing weak interactions in molecular liquids...|$|R
40|$|The structure, {{dynamical}} {{and electronic}} properties of liquid water utilizing different hybrid density functionals were tested within the plane wave framework of first principles molecular dynamics simulations. The computational approach, which employs modified functionals with short-ranged Hartree-Fock exchange, was first tested in calculations {{of the structural}} and bonding properties of the water dimer and cyclic water trimer. Liquid water simulations were performed at the state point of 350 K at the experimental density. Simulations included three different hybrid functionals, a meta functional, four gradient corrected functionals, the local density and Hartree-Fock approximation. It is found that hybrid functionals are superior in reproducing the experimental structure and dynamical properties {{as measured by the}} radial distribution function and self diffusion constant when compared to the pure density functionals. The local density and Hartree-Fock approximations show strongly over- and <b>under-structured</b> liquids, respectively. Hydrogen bond analysis shows that the hybrid functionals give slightly smaller averaged numbers of hydrogen bonds and similar hydrogen bond populations as pure density functionals. The average molecular dipole moments in the liquid from the three hybrid functionals are lower than from the corresponding pure density functionals...|$|R

5000|$|The Ford and Mazda design teams merged {{once again}} to give the Ford Probe a {{complete}} redesign for the 1993 model year. As before, the Probe was to share its <b>under-structure</b> with Mazda's MX-6 and 626. Mazda engineered the engine, transmission, and chassis, while Ford engineered the body and interior. Technically, the second generation Probe is 60% Mazda and 40% Ford. Despite the car being extended 2 inches and widened 4 inches, it was 125 pounds lighter than the first generation Probe. The second generation Probe was introduced in August 1992 as a 1993 model. As first planned during 1992, it finally went on sale in Europe {{in the spring of}} 1994, filling the gap left there by Ford in that market sector since the demise of the Capri seven years earlier. The Capri had regularly been one of Britain's 10 best selling cars throughout the 1970s, but its popularity declined in the early 1980s as Ford launched high performance versions of the Fiesta, Escort and Sierra hatchbacks. Such was the falling demand for this type of car that by 1986, when the end of Capri production was announced, Ford decided against launching a direct replacement.|$|E
50|$|The next {{match was}} the sixth {{on the main}} card, a Chicago Street Fight for the WWE Championship, in which CM Punk defended his title in his {{hometown}} against Chris Jericho in his tenth title defense. After weathering an initial flurry of offense from Punk, Jericho gained the edge and taunted Punk and his family. This earned Jericho a slap from Punk's sister at ringside. An aggravated Jericho went after Punk's sister, causing Punk {{to go into a}} frenzy, slamming Jericho through the top piece of the broadcast table, which had been removed and propped up against the <b>under-structure</b> of the table. When Jericho managed to re-establish an advantage, he taunted the straight edge Punk by pouring beer all over him. Then, Punk made a comeback and performed the Randy Savage diving elbow drop, but Jericho kicked out at two. Yet Jericho managed to block Punk's attempts at executing his finisher, the Go to Sleep, and managed to deliver a Codebreaker to Punk. Jericho then locked Punk in his finishing submission, the Walls of Jericho. Punk made it to the ropes while in the hold, but there were no rope breaks in the Street Fight format. Punk then reached under the ring, grabbed a fire extinguisher and sprayed it in Jericho's face to blind him and break the hold. Punk then executed a diving elbow drop from the top rope onto Jericho through the Spanish broadcast table. That did not give Punk a pinfall victory, however, and he locked Jericho in the Anaconda Vise. Jericho broke it by hitting Punk with a kendo stick. Punk then grabbed a chair and prepared to attack Jericho, but Jericho executed a Codebreaker into the chair on Punk. Jericho made the cover but Punk kicked out at the last second. Aiming to humiliate Punk, Jericho attempted Punk's finishing move, the Go to Sleep, but Punk countered and catapulted Jericho into an exposed turnbuckle that Jericho himself had exposed earlier in the match. Punk finished by delivering the Go to Sleep to Jericho for the pin and the win. Punk then celebrated retaining his WWE Championship with his hometown crowd.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this Letter, we {{investigate}} the <b>under-structures</b> of the π and B mesons {{in the framework}} of the Bethe–Salpeter equation with the confining effective potential (infrared modified flat bottom potential). In bare quark–gluon vertex approximation, we obtain the algebraic expressions for the solutions of the coupled rainbow Schwinger–Dyson equation and ladder Bethe–Salpeter equation. Firstly, we neglect the rainbow Schwinger–Dyson equation, take the bare quark propagator and solve the Bethe–Salpeter equation numerically alone. Although the bare quark propagator cannot embody dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and has a mass pole in the time-like region, it can give reasonable results for the values of decay constants fπ and fB compared with the values of experimental data and other theoretical calculations, such as lattice simulations and QCD sum rules. Secondly, we explore those mesons with{{in the framework of}} the coupled rainbow Schwinger–Dyson equation and ladder Bethe–Salpeter equation. The Schwinger–Dyson functions for the u and d quarks are greatly renormalized at small momentum region and the curves are steep at about q 2 = 1  GeV 2 which indicates an explicitly dynamical symmetry breaking. The Euclidean time Fourier-transformed quark propagator has no mass poles in the time-like region which naturally implements confinement. As for the b quark, the current mass is very large, the renormalization is more tender, however, mass pole in the time-like region is also absent.

40|$|Almost all the {{histories}} of Italian design tell us that design culture {{was born in a}} close relation between professionals and SMEs. Looking at this relation, we can read the story of the relation between design and strategy from a pretty peculiar perspective. Starting from those sectors today we would normally call “design-oriented”, Italian SMEs historically develop a symbiotic relationship with design, which becomes the engine of innovation: a driver which gives the opportunity to build their identity, and emerge in the domestic and in the international markets. This relation is almost always characterized by a direct link between entrepreneur and designer, in which the designer is not only asked to give shape to ideas, but rather to understand and interpret the needs, to anticipate desires, to build a “frame of meaning” around the market offer. The Italian entrepreneur is used to discuss with the designer the development of new products, defining market opportunities, and the possible solutions. In an <b>under-structured</b> context, where marketing (and for sure strategic marketing) is still missing, design plays a role of mediation in the relation between company and market, developing what we are used to call a strategic approach. In other words, in Italy design developed a strategic attitude from the very beginning, and did not become strategic after the meeting with marketing. The framework in which this happens is very particular: the entrepreneur usually operates within a confined space (the industrial cluster) in which his motivation to emerge is mainly linked to social legitimacy. This framework – to quote Weber backwards – builds a tension towards the creation of "beautiful and well made products" rather than a tension towards profit, which explains why design comes before marketing. This entire story happened in Italy {{in the absence of a}} structured presence of design within the university, which initially is not a "visible" player within the system. Only the profound transformations of the competitive scenario generated, in relatively recent times, a need for a specifically targeted research and education system, leading to the fast development of the design-system inside the university. If we look at it today, looks like it has been there from the very beginning, while its pretty recent birth is a sign of a profound change, carrying the need of more conscious approaches to design...|$|R
