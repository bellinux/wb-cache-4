Such a language is preferable to existing codes such as ANSI X. 12 and <b>UN</b> <b>EDIFACT</b> because of its much greater versatility. The new language is tentatively named LEC (Language for Electronic Commerce). 1 The problem 1. 1 Why a new language? Electronic data interchange (EDI) is the automated exchange between computers of the messages needed to carry out business transactions. Examples include electronic funds transfers, purchase orders, invoices, and various kinds of administrative information. ED 1 users range from corporations to armed forces to museums and libraries. Present-day ED 1 messages look like Figure 1, and I want to make them look like Figure 2. The difference is more than cosmetic. Current ED 1 standards such as ANSI X. 12 [l] and <b>UN</b> <b>EDIFACT</b> [2] are essentially data formats, consisting merely of data fields arranged on a predefined form. A new type of form is needed for each type of message- so that in practice, there are hundreds-and if a message doesn’t fit a predefined form, you can’t express it at all. For example, Moore [3] found it impossible to use ED 1 to tell a customer that, contrary to an earlier message, a shipment had not actually gone out. In this paper I want to sketch a new Language for Electronic Commerce (tentatively named LEC) in which messages are built by combining meaningful elements. ’ Essentially, LEC will work like a programming language except that instead of describing algorithms, it will describe business transactions. Messages are not limited to predefined ’ I want to thank Steve Kimbrough, Roggie Boone, and three anony-mous referees for assistance and encouragement with this project. I am solely responsible for errors that remain...|$|E
