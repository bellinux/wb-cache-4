40|$|In {{the context}} of {{identity}} management, a major research topic is the establishment of trust relationships between multiple identifier domains. Conventional approaches such as cross certification, spanning certificate authorities or mirroring of user databases result in substantial technical overhead. A possible approach is the usage of already existing architectures such as the infrastructure provided by trusted computing technology. The goal of this thesis {{is the development of}} a concept that allows a user from a certain identifier domain to access a service at a service provider belonging to a foreign identifier domain by using a ticket issued by an identity provider located in the primary identifier domain. To decide whether the foreign ticket can be accepted, the service provider first of all has to verify that the identity provider is authorized to issue tickets for the particular identifier domain. Moreover, the service provider has to validate the identity provider's configuration and system status at the moment of the ticket issuing in order to decide whether the identity provider's decision can be trusted. In the thesis, the realization of these requirements by using trusted computing technology is analyzed. For the authorization of the identity provider, the process of issuing attestation identifier credentials by the privacy-CA has to be adapted. If the identity provider is authorized to issue trusted tickets, the privacy-CA includes a certain key <b>usage</b> <b>attribute</b> in the certificate. In order to create the trusted tickets, SAML assertions are used to transport the status information from the identity provider to the foreign service provider. The flexible SAML framework allows the integration of the identity provider's status information signed with the attestation identifier key in the attributes of the assertion. For the creation of information describing the platform's current configuration and system status, the trusted computing technology offers the necessary attestation mechanisms. The developed concept and the reference implementation show {{that it is possible to}} use the trusted computing architecture for the establishment of trust relationships across multiple identifier domains in {{the context of}} identity management...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} to attribute clustering. It exploits the strength of semi-supervised learning {{to improve the quality}} of attribute clustering particularly when labeled data is limited. The significance of this work derives in part from the broad, and increasingly important, <b>usage</b> of <b>attribute</b> clustering to address outstanding problems within the machine learning community. This form of clustering has also been shown to have strong practical applications, being usable in heavyweight industrial applications. Although researchers have focused on supervised and unsupervised attribute clustering in recent years, semi-supervised attribute clustering has not received substantial attention. In this research, we propose an innovative two step iterative semi-supervised attribute clustering framework. This new framework, in each iteration, uses the result of attribute clustering to improve a classifier. It then uses the classifier to augment the training data used by attribute clustering in next iteration. This iterative framework outputs an improved classifier and attribute clustering at the same time. It gives more accurate clusters of attributes which better fit the real relations between attributes. In this study we proposed two new <b>usages</b> for <b>attribute</b> clustering to improve classification: solving the automatic view definition problem for multi-view learning and improving missing attribute-value handling at induction and prediction time. The application of these two new <b>usages</b> of <b>attribute</b> clustering in our proposed semi-supervised attribute clustering is evaluated using real world data sets from different domains...|$|R

In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel user profile formalization, which allows {{describing}} the user attributes as well as history of user access for personalized, adaptive and interactive experience while we believe that our approach is applicable to different semantic applications we illustrate our solution {{in the context of}} online and onsite museums and exhibits visit.

In order to construct such profile structures we extend and enrich existing metadata vocabularies for cultural heritage to contain keywords pertaining to <b>usage</b> <b>attributes</b> and user related keywords. By extending metadata vocabularies we allow improved matchmaking between extended user profile contents and cultural heritage contents. This extension creates the possibility of further personalization of access to cultural heritage available through online and onsite digital libraries. ...|$|R
30|$|Analysing the <b>usages</b> of <b>attributes</b> {{included}} in the evolved scheduling heuristics has also {{been done in the}} literature to understand the contributions of these attributes. For example, Nguyen et al. [89] analyses the frequency <b>usage</b> of <b>attributes</b> in the final dispatching rules evolved by GP to show what are the most useful attributes. Branke et al. [18] analysed the importance of each attribute by measuring the performance of the best rules when certain attributes are not available. Their analyses show that some attributes are more important for specific representations. Instead of independently investigating each attribute, Hunt et al. [55] performed fragment analyses to show the most common fragments (with the depth of two) in the evolved scheduling heuristics. The analyses show that some fragments representing the differences between due date, machine ready time, and current time appear most often in the evolved heuristics. The analyses also showed that most frequent fragments from different GP techniques can be different.|$|R

This heterogeneous distribution of resources and the various modes of collaborations that exist between users, virtual organizations, and resource providers require scalable, flexible, and fine-grained access control to protect both individual and shared computing resources. In this article we propose a usage control (UCON) based security framework for collaborative applications, by following a layered approach with policy, enforcement, and implementation models, called the PEI framework. In the policy model layer, UCON policies are specified with predicates on subject and object attributes, along with system attributes as conditional constraints and user actions as obligations. General attributes include not only persistent attributes such as role and group memberships but also mutable <b>usage</b> <b>attributes</b> of subjects and objects.

Given the rising demand for organic products {{on one hand and}} the decline in the organically farmed area in the UK on the other hand, this is an important topic to address. The present paper analyses the demand for organic products using both stated and revealed preferences from exactly the same consumers. The stated preference model is based on the respondent's choice from hypothetical choice sets. Attributes in the stated preference model are based on the ranges of the actual levels of attributes found in shops and are presented to respondents using a fractional factorial statistical design. Three different hypothetical bias treatments are applied in order to reduce hypothetical bias. The stated preference results are validated with the help of actual consumption data from the weekly shopping of the same consumers. The results show that there exists a core of organic consumers of about 20 - 30 % of the sample that have a positive willingness to pay for the organic label. However, consumers seem to be willing to pay more for other attributes such as a higher quality, environmentally friendly production and no chemical <b>usage.</b> <b>Attributes</b> such as animal welfare, and a longer expiry date do not seem to have the same relevance for the UK consumers...|$|R

It also investigated journalists' perceptions of North Korea and the multilateral nuclear talks, and how their perspectives correlate with the media content. To analyze these issues, the study conducted content analysis of U. S. and South Korean newspaper reports on the nuclear talks and administered a survey of U.

40|$|The word “queer” is a {{slippery}} one; its etymology is uncertain, and academic and popular <b>usage</b> <b>attributes</b> conflicting meanings to the word. By the mid-nineteenth century, “queer” {{was used as}} a pejorative term for a (male) homosexual. This negative connotation continues when it becomes a term for homophobic abuse. In recent years, “queer” has taken on additional uses: as an all encompassing term for culturally marginalised sexualities – gay, lesbian, trans, bi, and intersex (“GLBTI”) – and as a theoretical strategy which deconstructs binary oppositions that govern identity formation. Tracing its history, the Oxford English Dictionary notes that the earliest references to “queer” may have appeared in the sixteenth century. These early examples of queer carried negative connotations such as “vulgar,” “bad,” “worthless,” “strange,” or “odd” and such associations continued until the mid-twentieth century. The early nineteenth century, and perhaps earlier, employed “queer” as a verb, meaning to “to put out of order,” “to spoil”, “to interfere with”. The adjectival form also began to emerge during this time to refer to a person’s condition as being “not normal,” “out of sorts” or to cause a person “to feel queer” meaning “to disconcert, perturb, unsettle. ” According to Eve Sedgwick (1993), “the word ‘queer’ itself means across – it comes from the Indo-European root – twerkw, which also yields the German quer (traverse), Latin torquere (to twist), English athwart... it is relational and strange. ” Despite the gaps in the lineage and changes in usage, meaning and grammatical form, “queer” as a political and theoretical strategy has benefited from its diverse origins. It refuses to settle comfortably into a single classification, preferring instead to traverse several categories that would otherwise attempt to stabilise notions of chromosomal sex, gender and sexuality...|$|R
