When Bermudian sails came into general use, some skippers started {{to fly the}} ensign from two-thirds {{the way up the}} main-sail leech. Many {{consider}} this an affectation with the past. Others have taken to flying the ensign from a backstay. These are not good locations because the flag does not fly out well when hoisted raked forward.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the job of}} {{preventing}} cheating {{has been given to}} the teacher. It <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> in college the professor acted in loco parentis and was able to regulate student behavior as a parent. Thus, professors who discovered cheating could assign essentially any punishment they deemed appropriate. Students often had no mechanism for appeal. Generally, proctors were hired to patrol exams. If a case was particularly serious, a dean or other top-level administrator might have been involved. Against this inconsistent and paternalistic system, students at some schools rebelled and demanded to be treated as adults.|$|E
25|$|In the 11th century {{what was}} {{recognised}} as the Great Schism {{took place between}} Rome and Constantinople, which led to separation between the Church of the West, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Eastern Byzantine Churches, now the Orthodox. There were doctrinal issues like the filioque clause and {{the authority of the}} Roman Pope involved in the split, but these were greatly exacerbated by political factors of both Church and state, and by cultural and linguistic differences between Latins and Greeks. Regarding Papal supremacy, the Eastern half grew disillusioned with the Pope's centralization of power, as well as his blatant attempts of excluding the Eastern half in regard to Papacy approvals. It <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the Emperor would at least have say when a new Pope would be elected, but towards the high Middle Ages, the Christians in Rome were slowly consolidating power and removing Byzantine influence. However, even before this exclusionary tendency from the West, well before 1054, the Eastern and Western halves of the Church were in perpetual conflict, particularly during the periods of Eastern iconoclasm and the Photian schism.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Margaret Rossiter offered two {{concepts}} {{for understanding the}} mass of statistics on women in science and the disadvantages women continued to suffer. The first she called hierarchical segregation, the well-known phenomenon that as one moves up the ladder of power and prestige fewer females faces are to be seen. This notion is perhaps more useful {{than that of the}} glass ceiling, the supposedly invisible barrier that keeps women from rising to the top because the notion of hierarchical disparities draws attention to the multiple stages at which women drop off as they attempt to climb academic or industrial ladders. The second concept she offered was [...] "territorial segregation", how women cluster in scientific disciplines. The most striking example of occupational territoriality <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> women stayed at home and men went out to work.|$|E
2500|$|The caves of the Eletsky Monastery {{are said}} to predate those of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra (Kiev Monastery of the Caves). Its {{magnificent}} 6-pillared cathedral was erected {{at the turn of}} the 11th and 12th centuries; some traces of its 750-year-old murals may still be seen in the interior. After the domes collapsed in 1611, they were augmented and reconstructed in the Ukrainian baroque style. The wall, monastic cells, and bell-tower all date from the 17th century. The nearby mother superior's house is thought to be the oldest residential building in the Left-Bank Ukraine. The cloister's holiest icon <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of Theotokos, who made her epiphany to Svyatoslav of Chernigov on 6 February 1060. The icon, called Eletskaya after the fir wood it was painted upon, was taken to Moscow by Svyatoslav's descendants, the Baryatinsky family, in 1579.|$|E

The former judicial hostility to arbitration needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> discarded and a hospitable climate for arbitral resolution of disputes created.

2500|$|With a {{somewhat}} technical-sounding name, {{this is the}} most important bar to rescission in practice. [...] "Counter restitution" [...] simply means [...] "putting the parties back" [...] to their positions before the contract was consummated. For example, if our contract was a pen for £1, counter restitution would mean you giving back the pound and me giving up the pen. The aim is to ensure that a claimant is not unjustly enriched as a result of rescission. It <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> common law courts insisted on precise restitution. So in Clarke v Dickson it was held that a defrauded investor could not rescind the purchase of his shares because the investment was bound up in the company and the shares were now worth less. Precise counter restitution was impossible. However, the rule was mitigated, becoming more lenient. Now only substantial restitution is necessary. In Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co promoters (who are in law fiduciaries, and therefore subject to a duty to disclose material facts) did not tell investors that a mine on Sombrero island had been bought by the promoters for half the price that they were now valuing it for in the company. By the time investors realised, however, a substantial amount of phosphate had been mined. It clearly could not be put back in the ground. But Lord Blackburn held that since substantial restitution (i.e. the money equivalent) could be paid, rescission of the share contracts was not barred.|$|E
