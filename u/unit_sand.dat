UDB 410 (Construction Management) is a final year unit that consolidates skills students have learned throughout their degree, hopefully graduating them as work-ready construction managers. It was developed {{in consultation with the}} Queensland Chapter of the Australian Institute of Building (AIB) and is a final year unit in the undergraduate Bachelor of Urban Development (CM) course. The unit uses various tools such as the OSIRIS business database (Bureau van Dijk Electronic Publishing, 2009), the AROUSAL (UK Version) construction business simulation (Lansley, 2009) and the Denison Organisational Culture Survey (Denison, 2000) to facilitate the development of skills in managing a construction company.

40|$|Reservoir Characterization (RC) can {{be defined}} as the act of {{building}} a reservoir model that incorporates all the characteristics of the reservoir that are pertinent to its ability to store hydrocarbons and also to produce them. It is a difficult problem due to non-linear and heterogeneous subsurface properties and associated with a number of complex tasks such as data fusion, data mining, formulation of the knowledge base, and handling of the uncertainty. This present work describes the development of algorithms to obtain the functional relationships between predictor seismic attributes and target lithological properties. Seismic attributes are available over a study area with lower vertical resolution. Conversely, well logs and lithological properties are available only at specific well locations in a study area with high vertical resolution. Sand fraction, which represents per <b>unit</b> <b>sand</b> volume within the rock, has a balanced distribution between zero to unity. The thesis addresses the issues of handling the information content mismatch between predictor and target variables and proposes regularization of target property prior to building a prediction model. In this thesis, two Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based frameworks are proposed to model sand fraction from multiple seismic attributes without and with well tops information respectively. The performances of the frameworks are quantified in terms of Correlation Coefficient, Root Mean Square Error, Absolute Error Mean, etc. Comment: Supervisors: Prof. Aurobinda Routray and Prof. William K.

40|$|Techniques and {{approaches}} from the disciplines of pedology and geomorphology have been integrated {{to investigate the}} distribution and properties of soils, the development of landscapes, and to provide insights about previous climates and pedogenic processes in two areas in SE-Tasmania. The study areas include a coalesced fan landscape on a farm near Cambridge owned by the University of Tasmania, and a landscape of predominantly valley floor alluvial deposits in the Coal River Valley north of Richmond. Stratigraphic investigations show {{the landscape of the}} University Farm to be a pediment cut in predominantlyTertiary sediments covered by a veneer of Quaternary clastic deposits, with isolated outliers of Jurassic dolerite and Triassic sandstone rising above it. Stratigraphic units have been identified in the pedisediment based on differences in composition (source and nature of the sediment) and age (relative position in the landscape, degree of weathering and dissection). Sedimentological evidence suggests that these units have been formed by processes of lateral planation and alluvial and debris flow deposition ie., processes associated with both pediment and alluvial fan formation. Soil properties are related to the characteristics of each stratigraphic unit. They are attributable to both the composition and age of the <b>unit.</b> <b>Sand</b> infills have been identified in some soils and investigated using quartz grain morphoscopy and granulometric analysis. The infill phenomenon {{can be used as a}} time stratigraphic marker and provides insights about previous climatic conditions. Ferricrete and silcrete deposits were shown to have formed over discrete intervals of time due to precipitation from iron and silicon bearing groundwater flowing from higher level Jurassic dolerite and Triassic sandstone across hydraulic discontinuities in Tertiary sediments. The Coal River Valley has been shown to have a complex distribution of Quaternary sediments. These include alluvial deposits in a sequence of alluvial terraces (five stratigraphic units identified), pedisediment deposited on a surface cut in Tertiary basalt and Tertiary sediments (two stratigraphic units identified), and aeolian deposits (two units described). Soil profile classes have been identified developed in the stratigraphic units. Chronofunctions of properties of soils on alluvial stratigraphic units have been established, the most useful of which are depth functions of...|$|E
