50|$|The {{water monitor}} {{is a large}} species of monitor lizard. Breeding {{maturity}} is attained for males when they are a relatively modest 40 cm long and weigh 1 kg, and for females at 50 cm. However, they grow much larger throughout life, with males being larger than females. Adults rarely exceed 1.5 - 2 m in length, but the largest specimen on record, from Sri Lanka, measured 3.21 m. A common mature weight of V. salvator can be 19.5 kg. However, 80 males killed for the leather trade in Sumatra averaged only 3.42 kg and 56.6 cm snout-to-vent and 142 cm in total length; 42 females averaged only 3.52 kg and 59 cm snout-to-vent and 149.6 cm in total length, although <b>unskinned</b> outsized specimens weighed 16 to 20 kg.

40|$|An {{externally}} <b>unskinned</b> polysulfone ultrafiltration capillary membrane {{was used}} as an immobilisation matrix for the white rot basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium ME 446. In this study, different membrane bioreactor configurations, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and enzyme assays were used to characterise the spatial distribution of spores after immobilisation by reverse filtration and document the subsequent growth phases. A single capillary membrane bioreactor was also used to develop and evaluate a spore immobilisation technique by modifying conventional bioreactor configurations for reverse filtration onto the external surface of the membrane. Results indicate that spore immobilisation was dependent on a differential pressure across the tube wall and the fluid flow pattern in the tube, thus influencing the spatial distribution of spores along the surface and within the microvoids in the membrane wall. The resultant radial and lateral biofilm development using this reverse filtration approach promoted uniform biomass development, which favoured manganese peroxidase production. © 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2006 A {{protocol}} {{already exists}} for fabrication of a capillary membrane having an internal ultrafiltration skin {{supported by a}} finger-like pore structure in the external capillary wall (Jacobs and Leukes, 1996; Jacobs and Sanderson, 1997). These membranes have been produced at the Institute of Polymer Science, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa. Two major applications emerged from {{the development of these}} internally skinned membranes. One application was in the production of potable water by Ultra-filtration (UF) from sources containing coloured water. A second application was in the immobilization of a white rot fungus in a. "gradostat" membrane bioreactor. Here a nutrient gradient through the membrane wall and fungal mat can be established and manipulated in order to stimulate continuous production of secondary metabolites (extra-cellular enzymes). These enzymes are useful in the degradation of polycyclic aromatic compounds, notably PCB species in contaminated water and soils (Jacobs and Sanderson, 1997). Two objectives emerged from experiences with the above applications. The first objective was to improve membrane performance in UF applications. In this case a reduction was sought in trans-membrane pressure differential required to attain a desired flux without sacrificing rejection. The pressure required for a given desired flux across a membrane depends on the resistance of the membrane skin layer and of its supporting sub-layer which together comprises the capillary wall and defmes its overall structure. If any of these resistances could be reduced, the overall resistance to transport of water would be reduced. Then {{it would be possible to}} operate the membrane at lower trans-membrane pressure differences. On the other hand, operation with higher pressure would also increase flux but require a thicker capillary wall to resist this pressure. In the attempt to optimise these properties of the capillary membrane, capillary membranes produced in the study reported here were tested to find the relationship of flux performance with the structures that resulted from varying key parameters affecting structure and integrity. The objective in the case of immobilizing fungi in membrane bioreactor applications was to attain thicker walls thus providing better support for the fungal mass. The internally skinned capillary membrane has finger-like microvoids that start next to the UF skin layer and extend across the capillary membrane wall and open at the external membrane periphery, giving an ideal structure for retaining the fungal biomass. The idea of a membrane with this type of morphology to immobilize white rot fungi was to anchor the growing fungus within these microvoids which imitate the natural environment in which these organisms live, that is, in the fibrous structure of decaying wood. The requirement to inoculate the microvoids with fungal spores (reproductive cells), implies that they need to be accessible from the outside, requiring a membrane wall that is externally <b>unskinned.</b> In the formation ofthe capillary membrane the processes of formation of the porous UP skin and the finger-like microvoids are mainly governed by diffusion of solvent out of a polymer dope (gel phase) and of non-solvent into the dope phase. Such exchanges are of primary importance between the bore fluid (containing non-solvent) and dope (containing solvent) or between the external spinning bath (high in solvent content) and dope. Diffusion effects also occur between the nascent pore voids and the precipitating polymer matrix. There are also expected to be some convection effects due to shear between the bore fluid and the moving dope gel phase and due to shrinkage ofthe gel phase. The variables selected for experimentation m the study reported here were: the dope extrusion rate (DER); dope composition (viscosity effects); bore fluid flow rate (BFF); bore fluid composition and wall thickness and diameter effects (determined largely by spinneret dimensions). Each of these has an expected effect on membrane structure and its resulting performance. Most were varied over narrow ranges indicated in the literature and by experience to be effective and critical. In addition, the effects of altering the walI thickness were investigated by using two different spinneret sizes. The external spinning bath composition (solvent content) was reported in the literature to be a particularly important parameter in the formation of externally <b>unskinned</b> membranes. Maintaining a high content of solvent in the external spinning bath could prevent skin formation. Too high a solvent content could, however, prevent phase transition and lead to later precipitation ofa dense skin on contact with the non-solvent in the later (humidification and rinsing) steps in the fmishing of the capillary membrane product. The external bath composition was therefore varied so as to find the bath composition that would match the cloud point for the polymer dope employed. As expected, the thickness of the membranes increased with DER increase. However, it was found that there is a critical wall thickness where an external skin layer is formed as a result of increasing the DER. A certain volumetric ratio ofDER to BFF (1, 5 : 1 for this study) was therefore maintained in order to produce externally <b>unskinned</b> membranes. This shows that although the final membrane structure is detennined by the casting dope formulation, the fabrication protocol plays an equally important role in controlling structural properties and perfonnance. There was no significant change with the membrane thickness as a result of changing BFF but the voids became longer and more in number as the BFF was increased. Too high solvent content (99 % NMP in this study) resulted in an external skin layer being formed. According to Smolders et. al. (1992), when the solvent content in the external spinning bath is too high, the polymer at the surface of the newly fonned membrane slowly dissolves in the external spinning bath re-forming a dope-like solution. When the newly formed membrane passes through the humidifier, the dope-like solution solidifies to form an external skin. At the same instance, too low solvent (93 % for this study) resulted in external skin being fonned. Externally <b>unskinned</b> membranes were formed at 94 and 96 % NMP bath composition. The use of a small spinneret resulted in very thin walled externally <b>unskinned</b> membranes...|$|E
40|$|The {{bluefish}} (Pomatomus saltatrix) {{constitutes the}} main fishing resource in Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) coast in the autumn, {{winter and spring}} months. Considering that this fish is highly perishable, to have its shelf life increased an adequate treatment and processing are needed as soon as its capture occurs. Its use in the elaboration of a smoked product can represent considerable economic growth, if compared to its current "in natura" or frozen commercialization. A bluefish base smoked product was elaborated using natural smoke flavouring (known commercially as liquid smoke) defining the adjusted technological characteristics during the processing. The best form of liquid smoke application (immersion or sprinkling) was chosen sensorially by hedonic scale. The sprinkling of liquid smoke in the concentration of 20 % on <b>unskinned</b> bluefish fillets showed better acceptance in the sensorial evaluation. A daily 49. 5 ºC pay-drying of 45 minutes before the liquid smoke application favored its larger penetration in the bluefish muscle.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} a new {{perspective}} on the feeding physiology of whiting, Merlangius merlangus euxinus, N. 1840 was investigated. The effects of the skin of the prey, double feeding and prey type on the gastric emptying rate (GER) of whiting fed on natural prey, namely anchovy (Engraulis encrasicholus) and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), were investigated. Return of appetite was also studied. It was found that in laboratory conditions, whiting (48. 0 ± 8. 30 g, n= 12) had consumed about 10. 2 % of its body weight in mussels and return of appetite was found to be approximately 30 h. The effect of the skin of the anchovy on the gastric emptying rate (GER) in whiting was found to be significant. Skinned anchovy was emptied from the stomach in 30 h whilst <b>unskinned</b> anchory was emptied in 34 h. It was observed that the effect of the prey type, namely anchovy and mussels, was significant such that the gastric emptying rate of anchovy was 0. 063 g/h whilst that of mussels was found to be 0. 075 g/h. The reason was thought to be due to the different biochemical composition of the prey items used. In the double feeding experiments, {{it was found that the}} mussels given 4 h after the first meal of anchovy, slowed down the emptying process of the first meal.

40|$|ABSTRACT Socio-cultural {{perceptions}} {{and practices of}} dietary choices with focus on fat intake in middle aged Pakistani women in Oslo – a qualitative study Introduction: The nutritional transition has resulted globally in dietary changes, of which high intake of fats, sugar and refined carbohydrates {{are some of the}} main characteristics. This has resulted in increase in lifestyle diseases like type 2 Diabetes and Coronary Heart Disease. In Norway, a dramatic increase of type 2 Diabetes has been observed in migrant populations especially from the Indian subcontinent. Amongst these groups, prevention has resulted to some extent in increasing knowledge about the adversary effects of sugar and reduced intake of visible sugar. However this {{does not seem to be}} the case with fats leaving the issue of fats unattended. I wished therefore to explore {{perceptions and}} practices related to dietary fat intake in middle aged Pakistani women in Oslo. In particular, the intake of ghee(clarified butter) was interesting to explore, as ghee is a highly saturated fat and is an important component of the Asian dietary tradition. My objectives were therefore the following: •	To study socio-cultural perceptions and practice of dietary choices with focus on fat intake in middle aged Pakistani women in Oslo •	To identify possible barriers to changes in healthy choices of dietary fat intake •	To discuss its implications in preventive health care. Methodology: A qualitative method was chosen using in-depth interviews conducted with the help of an interview guide. This was supplemented by a structured questionnaire. Interviews were conducted on 12 Pakistani women in the age group 42 - 70 years in the period October-December 2002. The women were recruited at a centre for the elderly called Grûnerløkka Eldresenter and their informed written consent obtained. Interviews were conducted in Hindi/Urdu at the women’s convenience either in their homes or at the centre. Tape recordings were later transcribed and analysed by the principal investigator. Results and discussion: The study explored post migratory cooking methods, cooking medium and food selection. In the case of cooking methods, foods were mostly prepared as traditional curries or fried. This was done to provide”digestibility”and was similar to methods used before migration. Roasting, grilling and baking were also employed to some extent. Plain, boiled food was seldom eaten being reserved for people with “weak digestion” like babies, sick and old people. Concerning cooking medium, especially after family reunion, the womens main cooking medium was home made ghee symbolising “nourishment” and providing “correct taste”. In addition to ghee, low cost, refined plant oils like sunflower, corn oil were used for deep frying of ethnic snacks. Later, due to failing health and dietary recommendations, plant oils became the main cooking medium. Ghee was now reserved for providing nourishment of children’s foods and for taste in traditional festive foods. Plant oils were bought in large quantities and used generously with no attention paid to nutritional content, dates or quantity. Plant oils that were used for deep frying were reused several times over a period of several weeks. Some had tried olive oil but discontinued its usage due to unfamiliar taste and unsuitability and high price. In general, plant oils did not have the same status as ghee providing less nourishment in the women’s thinking. Concerning food selection, an increased intake of foods of animal origin was reported which was perceived as nourishing. Intake of red meats was high, as it was eaten daily in most households. All meat was ritually slaughtered classified as halal. Intake of vegetable and lentils remained negligible. Later due to failing health, and dietary recommendations, intake of white meats(chicken/fish) were added to red meat intake. This also matched adult childrens perceptions of healthy foods which they had integrated from the host population. However, cooking methods remained unaltered and risky as <b>unskinned</b> chicken and fish were made primarily as curries. When roasted or grilled, chicken was eaten as a side dish to a red meat curry. The same applied to baked fish. The most common fish intake remained fried fish fingers or fish burgers. The intake of vegetables and lentils was negligible. The few times vegetables and lentils were included, they were added to a meat curry, or made as a pure vegetable or pure lentil curry often with a meat curry in addition. Vegetables were also popularly fried. In the public sphere, foods served to guests were lavish, energy dense festive foods, primarily of animal origin, along with deep fried festive snacks and sweet desserts. As a guest one expected to be served such foods. Conclusion with implications for public health: The study shows that after migrating, despite following dietary recommendations of reducing sugar, ghee, switching to plant oils, and consuming more white meats and foods of vegetable origin, the impression was that total fat intake remained high due to cooking methods, choice of cooking medium and selection of foods as reported by the women. This was a general impression as no data on measuring of fat intake was done. Concerning fats, the study shows that the message “fat is harmful” as conveyed by the health professional is insufficient without the understanding of the role of such foods in the lives of these particular women. Future dietary messages must take cultural and ethnic differences into consideration and be tailored for each specific ethnic group. In addition, women’s health must be given importance, empowering them to make good decisions concerning their health. This will remain a public health challenge...|$|E
40|$|In this essay, first {{published}} in The Age, Maria Turmarkin explores what being silent or saying something actually means. In the upstairs food court at Melbourne Central, which I visit {{once in a while}} for some quick, under- 10 seafood, two teenage boys opposite me use their  iPhone to ascertain if Hitler was, in fact, part Jewish. They are loud enough to make a deep-fried calamari stop halfway in my throat. The boys are a picture of contentment and why shouldn’t they be — their iPhone is bursting with all kinds of salacious theories, their  cola cans are icy and their souvlakis are dripping with garlicky sauce. It is clear the boys’ quest is unlikely to be fuelled by an overriding concern for the millions of Hitler’s victims or for some kind of irreducible historical truth, but beyond that I do not {{know what to make of}} them. There is, after all, nothing obviously malicious (mildly obscene, yes, but not sinister) in the two boys dipping their toes in the vast pool of factoids, now instantly available to them courtesy of the iPhone, anywhere and anytime. Perhaps their interest in Hitler’s secret ancestry is random and they are merely doing a capabilities check on the uber-gizmo — can it really do just about anything? Or maybe the boys are savouring the possibility of a paradox, of a startling incongruity, because isn’t Hitler being part Jewish a bit like Hilary Duff being (apparently) a virgin? ‘‘Dude, this is interesting. Hitler was not a Jew but [...] . ’’ The boys get up, immersed in their discussion, continuing to lean unconsciously towards the iPhone as if it was the actual shared centre of their gravity. They walk away leaving me with my calamari and my silence.   Even after they are gone and I have all the time in the world to contemplate what has just happened, I have no idea whether I should have said anything — You always talk about mass murderers over lunch, boys? [...] . the man killed  6 million of my people [...] . why don’t you read about the camps instead of this puerile crap [...] . In another place and another time — in, say, Western Europe for large chunks of the last century or in the postwar Australia anxious not become a ‘‘tip for the refuse of Europe’’ or in the Soviet Union of my childhood where boys like these would have talked (just as loudly) about ‘‘kikes’’, not Jews — I would be pretty sure what saying nothing would mean. The silence of complicity and cowardliness, the great lubricating silence of the ‘‘silent majority’’. In another time and another place, I would have, or so I hope, tried to find words to spook the Dumb and Dumber, make them feel uncomfortable or maybe (in a time-honoured tradition) turn one against the other. But in this place and this time I feel much less sure-footed about my reactions, much less certain about what being silent or saying something actually means. In the public arena silence is more often than not associated with all kinds of dark and unsavoury things — the denial of truth and exercise of power, with fear, oppression or complicity. John Pilger, for example, called his recent Sydney Peace Prize acceptance speech ‘‘Breaking the Great Australian Silence’’. The term itself was coined by the anthropologist W. E. H. Stanner in his 1968 Boyer lectures to describe the all-pervasive forgetting of the indigenous Australians’ past and present. With his customary oratorical zeal, Pilger enlarged Stanner’s vision of the Australian silence to encompass a tradition of apathetic withdrawal propelled by our fear of strangers and strangeness, which ‘‘subdues and limits our political imagination and ensures we are always at war — against our own first people and those seeking refuge, or in someone else’s country’’. This is by now the familiar crusader view of the public silence, in which powerless are silenced by the powerful while the military-industrial-media-academia-whatever else complex perpetuates the conspiracy of silence and the silent majority, gagged by anxiety and self-interest, stands back and says nothing. Evil triumphs because good people do and say nothing, that kind of thing. Cue Simon and Garfunkel’s Sound of Silence (written in the wake of JFK’s assassination) : ‘‘Fools’’, said I, ‘‘you do not know Silence like a cancer grows’’ [...] . But my words like silent raindrops fell And echoed in the wells of silence. Remarkable, isn’t it, the centrality in our culture of this figure of the warrior — the defender of inconvenient truths — battling silence, or at least a certain kind of silence, as his or her principle nemesis. Sociologist Eviatar Zerubavel pins silence down as ‘‘the most public form of denial’’. Zerubavel sees silence in our public life in largely conspiratorial terms connected intimately with pain-avoidance, fear or shame. Puss pockets of silence found wherever there is injustice or abuse. Last year Four Corners broadcast a report about the role of sexual violence in rugby league culture titled Code of Silence. Silence in this context is a cover-up, a smoke screen, in which violence and abuse are able to thrive. Our language itself is filled with these ominous sounding expressions — dissenting voices are silenced [...] . the silent majority nods in agreement [...] . the conspiracy of silence [...] . lifting the veil of silence [...] . the silence of the lambs [...] . And the verbs ‘‘silence’’ attracts more often not denote some form of intervention — silence needs to be broken, smashed to pieces or intently peered through.   And should we call up the adjectives, we are unlikely to find much relief — heavy, oppressive, pregnant, chilling, ominous, deadly. This is, it seems, the good old silence for you. A kind of a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Of course, we do have accounts of the role of silence in shaping our history and identity that are not interested in evoking the idea of silence simply to further its own polemical ends. In The Water Dreamers: The Remarkable History of our Dry Continent, Michael Cathcart shows the powerful persistence with which early explorers and settlers imagined Australia as a silent continent, a silent wilderness outside of time. The vision of silence and, infamously, of terra nullius went hand in hand, for silence did not really describe the absence of sounds made by the continent’s inhabitants (and so the invisibility of their presence), but the absence of history ascribed to them. We read Cathcart and we begin to understand how and to what effect this almost obsessively conjured up silence made its way into the colonial mythology, becoming one of its foundational leitmotifs. In this mythology Aborigines inhabited silence, while explorers were engaged in the task of confronting and shattering it. For their part, settlers’ task was to tame the continent’s silence and to replace it with ‘‘the orderly sounds of civilisation’’. And this is where this willed silence needs to be understood as indeed toxic and violent in its intent. Public forms of silence do have, of course, some positive associations and uses. In our common law, for instance, the right to silence is an important guarantor of the presumption of innocence. Enshrined as a right, silence offers us protection from coercion and self-recrimination under duress. At the same time a widely observed tradition of a minute (or two) of silence puts silence at the centre of our public expressions of grief. We honour the dead in silence, which acts as a disinfectant of sorts, cleansing the living and our impure, noisy, forgetful, sacrilegious world.   And then, of course, we have the utopian silence. Like ‘‘some old forgotten animal from the beginning of time’’, German writer Max Picard wrote some six decades ago, ‘‘silence towers about all the puny world of noise’’. This is silence as the sublime — Gulliver in the land of Lilliputians (that’s us). In most religious and spiritual traditions silence is the domain of prayer, contemplation, observance and self-denial. And, of course, in our world of relentless noise assault and noise pollution this kind of silence as the place of purity and spirituality — or perhaps by now any kind of silence — seems close to extinction. Inevitably the idea of silence becomes heavily romanticised and cajoled by various ‘‘slowing down, logging off and dropping out’’ social movements. Still I wouldn’t want to over-ironise here. A recent book by writer Sara Maitland, for instance, speaks about the pursuit of silence not as a utopian project but as a practical and deliberate attempt to integrate silence into the author’s daily life. Maitland, who discovered and fell in love with silence during the nightly feeds of her first baby, is not interested in silence as the high-brow, exalted destination of the spiritually enlightened. She describes the first effect of being silent as ‘‘an extraordinary intensification of physical sensations’’.   Eating and cooking became almost overwhelmingly gratifying, and then it was the turn of hearing. Maitland could soon enough distinguish between different wind sounds – the wind that was roaming free and the wind entangled in the chimney — and the rhythms of their courtship. The longer the writer remained silent, the more intensely emotional she became. Without the release provided by speech, everything from giggles to tears became deepened and amplified tenfold. The silence, Mainland writes, ‘‘itself <b>unskinned</b> me’’. But whether you think of silence as the domain of oppression and complicity or as the expression of respect, humility and deeper awareness, in all of these instances silence still stands for the absence of speech, and so essentially for a lack, a void, a lacuna. Yet in the field of linguistics, it has long been understood that silence and speech do not stand in opposition to each other, but exist as part of the same continuum. Silence can be the continuation of conversation by other, extra-verbal means. Cultural critic Michael Epstein points out that the choice between speaking and not speaking ‘‘is a concealed act of speech’’. Speechlessness and powerlessness often go together, but not always and certainly not automatically. There is, after all, a profound gulf between silence enforced and silence freely chosen, for this deliberate strategic silence could be a place of power and freedom.   Feminist academic Cheryl Glenn reminds us of a long-standing tradition of women’s rhetorical silence: of silence, in other words, not imposed on women but embraced and practiced by them through the ages as a rhetorical art. Just like speech, silence could be used to conceal, threaten and overpower, but also to reveal, empower and fight back. It could be an expression of defeat or of defiance and stoicism. ‘‘Neither speech nor silence,’’ writes Glenn, ‘‘is more successful, communicative, informative, revealing, or concealing than the other. ’’ Sara Maitland lists an array of silences that do not denote an absence, a void or a lack — the silence of the natural world that brings on peace and contentment, the silence of awareness of self and other, the silence after seriously good sex, the silence of mystical experience, the silence of listening to music and the silence of reading and writing.   If we find ourselves silent with other people, it may because we have hit the limit of our ability and willingness to communicate with each other or because we have reached the level of understanding and mutual comfort where words are no longer, at least for the moment, required. Friends, I grew up believing, were the kinds of people you were comfortable being silent with. Couples that are good together often come to this point of deriving great sustenance from doing their own things in each other’s presence, sometimes not exchanging a single word for hours.   Mikhail Epstein (following the Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin) notes the categorical difference between silence and quiet. Unlike quiet, silence ‘‘is a form of consciousness’’, he writes, ‘‘a method of its articulation, and it takes its rightful place alongside its other forms — to think about [...] . to speak about [...] . to ask about [...] . to write about [...] . to be silent about [...] . ’’ The linguist and writer Ruth Wajnryb says it beautifully in The Silence: How Tragedy Shapes Talk, her book on the complex rituals of speech and silence in the Holocaust survivor households, like the one she herself grew up in. ‘‘I have learned,’’ Wajnryb writes, that silence is as complex as spoken language, as differentiated and as subtle. Sometimes it is self-imposed, sometimes, other-imposed. Sometimes it is driven by the urge to protect or salvage or cherish; other times, as a weapon of defence or control or denial. One thing that underscores all instances: it is rarely unproblematic. Silence has many faces and meanings ‘‘as it fills the pauses and cracks and crannies of our discourse, of our relationships and of our lives’’. In the Holocaust survivor households ‘‘two kinds of conflicted energy’’ shape the interaction between survivors and their children — ‘‘on the part of the survivor, it is the attempt to tell and the accompanying suppression of telling; on the part of the descendant, it is the wanting to know, and the accompanying fear of finding out’’.   Just like Ruth Wajnryb, I grew up in the world where communication depended on the finely attuned techniques of listening to and decoding silences. In fact, in the former Soviet Union where I am from, silence was part of every conversation — as a listener, you had to be able to gauge what was not being said, who it was not being said to, what was the relationship between what was and what was not being said, what kind of listening was called for by this particular silence. Perhaps because questions of silence and speech were so closely connected to those of life and death, silence itself felt much closer to the bone. For decades a word, a joke, a complaint, a sentence said in passing or wildly misinterpreted could alter one’s life beyond recognition. You had to weigh your words very carefully but your silences too, since any non-participation in various activities and rituals prescribed by the state carried the threat of hefty punishment as well. And so within the Soviet context, I could discern a whole symphony of different silences beyond the repressive or coercive kinds — conscious silence, pragmatic silence, defiant silence, moral silence and, of course, not to err on the side of the overly optimistic, cowardly and opportunistic silence. In the world where I grew up silence had multiple meanings, uses and registers. I am pretty sure most people out there could say the same. How we think about silence has serious implications for the way we understand human memory. Silence is not invariably the burial ground of memory — the metaphoric place, where memories are extinguished, eroded or dissolved. We have tended to imagine that the transmission of memories and stories particularly across generations is dependent on acts of speech. Someone has to be telling the stories. But if we view silence as a rich and potent medium of communication, then it becomes apparent that it is acts of listening rather than those of speech that are the essential, non-negotiable part of any inter-generational exchange. We may be a culture of speech worshippers, believing together with Thomas Mann that ‘‘speech is civilisation itself’’, but we are also beginning to think much more deeply about silence. The most acclaimed Australia film of 2009, Samson and Delilah, has been praised for its minimal reliance on the dialogue and for the kinds of spaces in characters’ interiors as well as in the worlds they inhabit and pass through, which the film’s wordlessness has opened up. David Stratton’s glowing review of the movie was titled ‘‘A world beyond words’’.   We can in fact learn a great deal from the way silence is employed as a powerful and at times transformative aesthetic and critical practice not only in cinema but also of course in music, theatre, performance, dance, and visual arts. Think Chekhov, Cage, Beckett, Cunningham, Bergman, Malevich and Duchamp.   American music theorist and a musician in her own right Jennifer Judkins points to musicians’ keenly-developed abilities of listening to silence: “In the process of testing the characteristics of each stage and hall prior to the concert, the musician is also discovering the nature of silence in that hall. ”   The ability to listen and to hear necessarily encompasses in itself the ability to listen to silence, to recognise its quality and meanings and emotions contained within it. This kind of realisation is increasingly seeping into our world and it may seem kind of ‘‘special interest’’ or esoteric, but it is bound to change the way we think about politics, culture, media and the public sphere itself. For so long most of our political, artistic and intellectual projects have been about the prized possession of a ‘‘voice’’, but now a new generation of academics, artists, media practitioners and activists are telling us that acts, publics and cultures of ‘‘listening’’ resonate culturally and politically, and that, to a large degree, they structure the lives of our cities, the direction of our politics and the exchanges within and across cultures. And now that the importance of listening has been unearthed, surely an interest in different registers and cultures of silence will follow. In fact, from what I can tell, this interest is already here. In a recent series of programs on Radio National titled Stories of Silence, silence is a fully-fledged, intensely meaningful presence. It is not an absence of speech, not a metaphor for something else, not a poetic flourish, but the epicentre of powerful and memorable stories about all kinds of things from life in the Holocaust survivor households to the cowardly, complicit silence of a mob. We listen to a highly articulate young woman who stopped talking at the age of five due to a condition known as selective mutism and whose words come to us courtesy of another young woman’s voice — that of a gifted Australian actor Miranda Pia. El, we discover, communicates without speech. The silence with which she greets the outside world is by no means the blanket refusal to enter into any conversation. But to hear El, we first need to learn how to listen. We come to recognise a very different kind of silence that people with mental illnesses often crave — silence as the safe heaven from voices in their heads. We listen to the music written by the accomplished Australian composer Elena Kats-Chernin who has been composing with this kind of silence on her mind ever since her son was diagnosed with schizophrenia. There is the dark, vicious silence of sexual abuse that in the case of German writer Corinna Waffender’s merges together with the silence about her family’s Nazi past — silence that binds her family together even as it dismantles and erodes the ties between its members. Radio, of course, is a particularly potent medium for making us listen to our own listening. In her Letter from Bundanon the late Dorothy Porter described working on an opera, Eternity Man together with composer Jonathan Mills — she was in Bundanon ‘‘scratching for words’’ while Mills was there too ‘‘scratching for sounds’’. ‘‘The natural world,’’ Porter wrote, ‘‘can creep up on you in the silence like the march fly that has just landed noiselessly on my bare leg. The silence can be a haunted and itchy space, thick with known and unknown histories and presences, all indifferent to my spooked frailties. ’’   This is what we keep forgetting about silence — its thickness and vast carrying capacity, its itchiness and potency, the way it can swallow us whole or take us apart. Yet our every conversation, every relationship, every journey, every crisis and epiphany is a reminder of silence’s hundred faces and of the undeniably central place it has always been able to claim in our life.   First published in 2 ̆ 7 The Age 2 ̆ 7 A 2, February 6, 2010.
