25|$|Unlike the manuscripts {{from the}} Umayyad Dynasty, {{many of the}} early Abbasid manuscripts were copied {{in a number of}} volumes. This is evident from the large scripts used and the smaller number of lines per page. Early Qur'anic manuscripts provide {{evidence}} for the history of the Qur'anic text and their formal features tell <b>us</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the way art and its deeper meaning were perceived in the classical age of Islam. Both its script and layout turned out to be constructed according to elaborate geometrical and proportional rules.|$|E
25|$|An {{analytic}} proposition is true {{by nature}} {{of the meaning of}} the words in the sentence — we require no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand this proposition. On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one that tells <b>us</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the world. The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content. In this instance, weight is not a necessary predicate of the body; until we are told the heaviness of the body we do not know that it has weight. In this case, experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear. Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf. Hume) and rationalists (cf. Leibniz) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known.|$|E
500|$|From {{the early}} drafts, Hammerstein and Logan made {{the issue of}} racial {{prejudice}} central to the story. Hammerstein repeatedly rewrote the Act II backstage scene where Emile, Nellie and Cable confront {{the question of the}} Americans' racism. As critic Robert Butler pointed out in his educational companion to the 2001 London production, [...] "if one young person has a prejudice, it might be a character flaw; if two young people share a prejudice, it tells <b>us</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the society in which they grew up". In one draft, Emile advises that the Americans are no better than the Axis Powers, in their prejudice, and suggests they go home to sing songs about how all are created free and equal. [...] Lovensheimer states that a postwar American audience would have found such onstage sentiments to be offensive. In the staged version, Emile's expressions are limited to two lines arguing that prejudice is not inborn.|$|E

60|$|But still, {{the cross}} is our sign. It is God's {{everlasting}} token to us, {{that he has}} told <b>us</b> Christians <b>something</b> <b>about</b> himself which none of the wisest among the heathen knew; which infidels now do not know; which nothing but the cross can teach to men.|$|R
2500|$|... {{the above}} {{equation}} tells <b>us</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> complex logarithms by relating natural logarithms to imaginary (complex) numbers. Bernoulli, however, did not evaluate the integral.|$|E
2500|$|For Hume, {{we assume}} that {{experience}} tells <b>us</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the world because of habit or custom, which human nature forces us to take seriously. This is also, presumably, the [...] "principle" [...] that organizes the connections between ideas. Indeed, {{one of the many}} famous passages of the Inquiry was on the topic of the incorrigibility of human custom. In a later chapter, he wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|One day (Service later wrote), while pondering what {{to recite}} at an {{upcoming}} church concert he met E.J. [...] "Stroller" [...] White, {{editor of the}} Whitehorse Star. White suggested: [...] "Why don’t you write a poem for it? Give <b>us</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> our own bit of earth. We sure would appreciate it. There’s a rich paystreak {{waiting for someone to}} work. Why don’t you go in and stake it?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Writing for All About Jazz, David Adler said [...] "Classical purists haven't {{been too}} thrilled with Caine's efforts, but they aren't really his audience. Whether you'd rather listen to Uri Caine's Mahler or to Mahler himself is a {{subjective}} question. But one shouldn't deny Caine credit for teaching <b>us</b> <b>something</b> new <b>about</b> music's elasticity".|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} soundtrack by David Schwartz {{does not}} include any songs by the Beatles because [...] "the producers could not get clearance from the notoriously difficult copyright holders, a company owned by Michael Jackson." [...] Critic Jim DeRogatis notes that, [...] "the movie was over before {{it struck me that}} the soundtrack was devoid of any Beatles songs [...] Such is our saturation in all things Beatles-related that their actual music isn't even missed in the movie. And maybe that should tell <b>us</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> getting back to what really matters in this group's legacy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Bloom {{published}} The Western Canon, {{a survey}} of the major literary works of Europe and the Americas since the 14th century, focusing on 26 works he considered sublime and representative of their nations and of the Western canon. Besides analyses of the canon's various representative works, the major concern of the volume is reclaiming literature from those he refers to as the [...] "School of Resentment", the mostly academic critics who espouse a social purpose in reading. Bloom believes that the goals of reading must be solitary aesthetic pleasure and self-insight rather than the goal held by [...] "forces of resentment" [...] of improving one's society, which he casts as an absurd aim, writing: [...] "The idea that you benefit the insulted and injured by reading someone of their own origins rather than reading Shakespeare is one of the oddest illusions ever promoted by or in our schools." [...] His position is that politics have no place in literary criticism: a feminist or Marxist reading of Hamlet would tell <b>us</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> feminism and Marxism, he says, but probably nothing about Hamlet itself.|$|E
2500|$|On January 29, 2013, Variety {{announced}} that Italian director Luca Guadagnino is to direct an adaptation, called Body Art, of DeLillo's 2001 novel The Body Artist. On April 26, 2013, it was {{announced that}} DeLillo had received the inaugural Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction (formerly the Library of Congress Creative Achievement Award for Fiction), with the presentation of the award due to take place during the 2013 Library of Congress National Book Festival, Sept. 21–22 2013. The prize honours [...] "an American literary writer whose body of work is distinguished not only for its mastery of the art but for its originality of thought and imagination. The award seeks to commend strong, unique, enduring voices that – throughout long, consistently accomplished careers – have told <b>us</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the American experience." [...] In a statement issued in response to the award, DeLillo said [...] "When I received news of this award, my first thoughts were of my mother and father, who came to this country the hard way, as young people confronting a new language and culture. In a significant sense, the Library of Congress Prize is the culmination of their efforts and a tribute to their memory." ...|$|E

Embedded within this novel—interestingly—is a strong criticism of an approach to education mockingly {{referred to as the}} “Dewey Decimal System. ” In this essay I explore Lee’s criticism of progressive education and argue that it tells <b>us</b> <b>something</b> interesting <b>about</b> the novel and about approaches to education inspired by John Dewey...|$|R

For remember, as I tell you every Sunday, that each fresh story in the Pentateuch reveals to <b>us</b> <b>something</b> fresh <b>about</b> the character of God. What does Balaam's story reveal? Balaam himself tells us in the text, 'God {{is not a man}} that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent. Hath he said, and shall he not do it?' ...|$|R

5000|$|Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "It’s {{difficult}} {{to think of}} any director, ever, who had a more consistently uneven career." [...] According to Jean-Pierre Coursodon, his films were recognized as [...] "unpretentious, closely observed, finely textured works...there comes a point when, looking back, one sees that their consistency itself - consistent excellence - is telling <b>us</b> something: <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the way that cinema itself is able to move out and look around."

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the current turmoil in {{international}} financial markets. While this is often named after the US subprime sector in which it originated, he suggests that an alternative description could be the TLA crisis, given the profusion of three letter acronyms such as MBS, CDO and SIV deployed in any analysis of developments. The author argues that recent events tell <b>us</b> <b>something</b> important <b>about</b> the current financial system and its vulnerability to crisis, and provide some significant lessons for regulators and central banks...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The flash-lag effect. When {{a visual}} {{stimulus}} moves along a continuous trajectory, {{it may be}} seen ahead of its veridical position with respect to an unpredictable event such as a punctuate flash. This illusion tells <b>us</b> <b>something</b> important <b>about</b> the visual system: contrary to classical computers, neural activity travels at a relatively slow speed. It is largely accepted that the resulting delays cause this perceived spatial lag of the flash. Still, after several decades of debates, {{there is no consensus}} regarding the underlying mechanisms.|$|R

50|$|Structural {{complexity}} {{emerges from}} all systems that display morphological organization (Nicolis & Prigogine 1989). Filamentary structures, for instance, are {{an example of}} coherent structures that emerge, interact and evolve in many physical and biological systems, such as mass distribution in the Universe, vortex filaments in turbulent flows, neural networks in our brain and genetic material (such as DNA) in a cell. In general information {{on the degree of}} morphological disorder present in the system tells <b>us</b> <b>something</b> important <b>about</b> fundamental physical or biological processes.|$|R
