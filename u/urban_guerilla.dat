2500|$|Believing {{they had}} {{the upper hand in}} the conflict, {{beginning}} in 1980 the Islamists began a series of campaigns against government installations in Aleppo; the attacks became <b>urban</b> <b>guerilla</b> warfare. The government began to lose control in the city and, inspired by events, similar disturbances spread to Hama, Homs, Idlib, Latakia, Deir ez-Zor, Maaret-en-Namen and Jisr esh-Shagour. Those affected by Ba'athist repression began to rally behind the insurgents; Ba'ath Party co-founder Bitar supported the uprising, rallying the old, anti-military Ba'athists. The increasing threat to the government's survival strengthened the hard-liners, who favored repression over concessions. Security forces began to purge all state, party and social institutions in Syria, and were sent to the northern provinces to quell the uprising. When this failed, the hard-liners began accusing the United States of fomenting the uprising and called for the reinstatement of [...] "revolutionary vigilance". The hard-liners won the debate after a failed attempt on Assad's life in June 1980, and began responding to the uprising with state terrorism later that year. Under Rifaat al-Assad Islamic prisoners at the Tadmur prison were massacred, membership in the Muslim Brotherhood became a capital offence and the government sent a death squad to kill Bitar and Attar's former wife. The military court began condemning captured militants, which [...] "sometimes degenerated into indiscriminate killings". Little care was taken to distinguish Muslim Brotherhood hard-liners from their passive supporters, and violence was met with violence.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Urban</b> <b>Guerillas</b> {{were chosen}} to perform at Euro-region Camp 2000 for young Europeans visiting Australia during the 2000 Summer Olympics to study Antipodean social {{structure}} and culture. Over the years, apart from their appearances in hotels and venues throughout Australia, the <b>Urban</b> <b>Guerillas</b> have played at Sydney Airport to 6,000 workers stranded when Ansett Australia collapsed, Peace Rallies in Sydney and Brisbane, No Racism, No War Rally to 50,000 people in the Domain, Corroboree Sovereignty for indigenous rights at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra, Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre 2002 Festival of Freedoms, May Day celebrations of workers rights, NAIDOC celebrations and the Hiroshima Never Again Rally commemorating those who {{died as a result}} of the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The <b>Urban</b> <b>Guerillas</b> historically played on Cockatoo Island (New South Wales) with Roaring Jack in 1989 and played on the pickets at Port Botany for the Maritime Union of Australia in 1998 to support workers at threat of losing their jobs. In 2008 they played at the 10 years on from the Maritime Union of Australia waterfront dispute [...] "MUA Here to Stay" [...] concert and against the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum on the back of a truck in Sydney's CBD.|$|R

50|$|The Tupamaros (also {{known as}} the National Liberation Movement), was the {{informal}} name of an <b>urban</b> <b>guerilla</b> that {{was active in the}} 1960s and early 1970s in Uruguay. The name was also direct influence of Túpac Amaru II and its ideals.|$|E
50|$|In 2000 {{she worked}} {{on the first of}} a number of collaborations with the German-Turkish film maker Neco Celik. She was the {{production}} designer for his film <b>Urban</b> <b>Guerillas</b> (2003). In 2005 Ergün produced the stage sets for a theatre productions by Yüksel Yolcu of The Rose of Istambul at the Neuköllner Opera (theatre in Berlin).|$|R
50|$|In October 2006 the <b>Urban</b> <b>Guerillas</b> {{returned}} to outback and regional Australia starting from Adelaide and touring to Pimba, Roxby Downs, Coober Pedy, Alice Springs,Oodnadatta, Pt Augusta, Streaky Bay, Iron Knob, Pt Pirie, Leigh Creek, Broken Hill, Cobar and Nyngan, this time aided by funding through {{a grant from}} the Federal Government and Music NSW to introduce their Every Generation single which promptly received airplay on Triple J.|$|R
50|$|In 1983 {{they went}} into Studios 301 to record and {{released}} the song 1984 on their own label, The single sold in enough quantities {{to attract the attention}} of George Wayne from Triple J who invited the band into the Australian Broadcasting Corporation studios to play live to air. In 1984 they recorded a more pop-oriented single, She's Probably, produced by Adelaide guitarist Mal Eastick from Stars (Australian band) and producer of the Andy Durant Memorial Concert. This single won numerous favourable reviews around the country and gave the band a boost around Sydney before a membership reshuffle took some time to consolidate the new four-piece line up.The band resurfaced nationally in 1986 with their Borrowed Time EP and an appearance on a nationally televised talent quest Star Search (Australia). During this time the <b>Urban</b> <b>Guerillas</b> played regularly at the Sandringham (Sando) and until Roaring Jack entered the scene, had held the over-the-bar record of takings at the famous inner west hotel. (The Roaring Jack crowd consistently managed to out-drink the <b>Urban</b> <b>Guerillas</b> punters). The band toured nationally in 1986 mostly headlining but also playing some notable supports with The Saints, The Hitmen, the New Christs and Spy vs Spy. In 1987 the band released their signature tune Here Come the Americans. An anthem against the Americanisation of Australian culture. Using a war analogy for the cultural invasion gave the song a literal interpretation that resonated with the peace movement. The song gave the <b>Urban</b> <b>Guerillas</b> a provocative edge and the renewed attention from the media delivered access to the suburban venues. Through various line-up changes the band experimented and consistently fronted up as an energetic and formidable live performance unit until the end of 1987, when after much touring and having all their gear stolen, the Guerillas had imploded.|$|R

5000|$|The book {{chronicles the}} group and {{provides}} a brief biography of the main members, Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin, and also describes Ulrike Meinhof's life leading up to her terrorist career.

50|$|He {{was born}} in Berlin-Kreuzberg to Turkish immigrants. His father was a gardener, and his mother a {{domestic}} worker. In his youth, before going into film directing and teaching media, Çelik belonged to a gang called 36 Boys, corresponding to the postal address of Berlin 36 at the time. After making a fake documentary and two short films, he directed two feature films, Alltag and <b>Urban</b> <b>Guerillas,</b> both earning Çelik international acclaim as Germany’s young and upcoming Spike Lee.|$|R
50|$|A tough, punk-influenced {{band with}} a {{fiercely}} independent streak, The <b>Urban</b> <b>Guerillas</b> {{was formed in}} Adelaide in 1980 as a trio with Ken Stewart (guitar/vocals), Terry Burgan (bass/vocals) and John Martin (drums). Terry and John had recently moved to Adelaide from Whyalla. After playing their relentless, driving brand of original pop / punk rock music around Adelaide for {{a little over two}} years and releasing two independent cassettes, the band moved to Sydney and seamlessly slotted into the live pub circuit.|$|R
50|$|In 1995 with Just a Lifetime getting airplay, {{the band}} again played {{regularly}} around Sydney in various line-ups while releasing the Mad in Australia EP CD in 1997 and Carols by Blowtorch and Cloud Above my Head albums in 1999.In 2001 the <b>Urban</b> <b>Guerillas</b> released their Big Brothersingle and began touring interstate. Through 2002 the band extensively toured the outback including regional Northern Territory and South Australia, twice touring the remote outback and desert townships of central Australia including Alice Springs.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{influential}} anti-capitalist text The Coming Insurrection, the authors prescribe an armed resistance that nonetheless avoids militarization: [...] "Weapons are necessary: it’s {{a question of}} doing everything possible to make using them unnecessary…the prospect of Iraq-style <b>urban</b> <b>guerilla</b> warfare, dragging on with no possibility of taking the offensive, is more to be feared than to be desired. The militarization of civil war is the defeat of insurrection." ...|$|E
50|$|State of Siege (1972) {{takes place}} in Uruguay under a {{conservative}} government in the early 1970s. In a plot loosely based {{on the case of}} US police official and alleged torture expert Dan Mitrione, an American embassy official (played by Yves Montand) is kidnapped by the Tupamaros, a radical leftist <b>urban</b> <b>guerilla</b> group, which interrogates him in order to reveal the details of secret American support for repressive regimes in Latin America.|$|E
50|$|Stern began {{organizing}} his new underground army {{by focusing}} on four fronts: 1) publishing a newspaper and making clandestine radio broadcasts offering theoretical justifications for <b>urban</b> <b>guerilla</b> warfare; 2) obtaining funds for the underground, either by donations or by robbing British banks; 3) opening negotiations with foreign powers {{for the purpose of}} saving Europe’s Jews and developing allies in the struggle against the British in Palestine; 4) actual military-style operations against the British.|$|E
50|$|Strife had {{escalated}} {{since the}} late 1960s, adding to Buenos Aires’ usual instability. Radicals, ex-Peronists, writers and intellectuals joined <b>urban</b> <b>guerillas,</b> creating even further havoc. Strikes, riots and economic collapse followed. The chaotic situation turned dire in 1974 when Isabel Perón took power and street fighting between right-wing death squads and guerillas surged. Bombings and atrocities became routine; riots were used {{as an excuse for}} military brutality and takeover. The coup in 1976 resulted in an estimated 9,000-30,000 “disappeared.” Noé went into exile, relocating to Paris.|$|R
50|$|In 1988 Stewart played solo in {{addition}} to supporting Roaring Jack whilst putting together another three piece. This outfit toured to Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide frequently and the suburban bars in Sydney but their regular work became {{to an abrupt end}} when Stewart fell off the drum-kit while playing guitar during a gig in Oatley, breaking his wrist.However, before the accident the <b>Urban</b> <b>Guerillas</b> had managed to record their first album, Another View, in 1989 with Phil Punch at Electric Avenue studio and released it in 1990 to critical acclaim.|$|R
25|$|In a {{counterinsurgency}} situation, {{the perception}} of the government (i.e., McCormick's CF) violating the human rights of the population causes Eisenstat's legitimacy gap to widen. The Phoenix program in South Vietnam was criticized for a lack of precision in its targeting, and caused a further loss in legitimacy of the government, regardless of the damage done to the Viet Cong infrastructure. Marighella recommended that <b>urban</b> <b>guerillas</b> deliberately provoke the government into overreaction, as a means of reducing its legitimacy; the doctrine of having FID trainers counsel respect for human rights has pure military, not just humanitarian, justification.|$|R
50|$|The {{roots of}} the Poli ultras {{movement}} {{can be found in}} 1995 when groups like <b>Urban</b> <b>Guerilla</b> or Gruppo Autonomo Viola appear in the South End. Poli's most important rivalry is with UTA Arad. The match between them, Derby-ul Vestului (The West Derby), has been the leading Romanian football encounter in the last 65 years, as Poli and UTA are the two most successful football teams from the west of the country.|$|E
5000|$|In 1964, General Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco led a coup that {{replaced}} the existing government {{with a military}} junta. There was a severe recession, which led to popular dissatisfaction with the government. By 1968, <b>urban</b> <b>guerilla</b> warfare was rampant. However, this also provoked paramilitary death squads, censorship, and harsh political repression. [...] Amaral's banana paintings were {{a direct result of}} the state of Brazil by 1968 who used the banana as a subversive symbol.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 he was {{appointed}} finance minister {{in the government of}} Julio César Méndez Montenegro. However, his reformist financial policies, including a controversial fiscal reform, resulted in his transfer from the ministry of finance to the ministry of foreign affairs.On February 27, 1970, while serving as Guatemala's minister of foreign affairs, Fuentes Mohr was briefly kidnapped by an <b>urban</b> <b>guerilla</b> commando of the FAR, but was released just before election day after the government released FAR rebel Vicente Girón Calvillo from prison.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 and 14 January 1976 the {{defendants}} readied their testimony (about 200 pages) {{where they were}} analyzing the role of imperialism and its furious struggle against the revolutionary movements in {{the countries of the}} [...] "third world." [...] They also expounded the fascistization of West Germany and its role as an imperialistic state (alliance with USA over Vietnam). Finally they talked about the task of <b>urban</b> <b>guerillas</b> and they undertook the political responsibility for the bombing attacks. Finally their lawyers (following Ulrike Meinhof's proposal) requested that the accused be officially regarded as prisoners of war.|$|R
