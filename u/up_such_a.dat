5|$|On April 4, 1968, African-American {{civil rights}} leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated by a sniper in Memphis, Tennessee. United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy was {{traveling}} to Indianapolis to promote his presidential campaign {{when he heard the}} news. He delivered a brief, improvised speech on the matter before suspending all of his campaign activities and withdrawing to his room at the Marott Hotel. After several phone conversations with black community leaders, he decided to speak out against the violent backlash to the assassination and carry on with a scheduled appearance before the City Club of Cleveland. His aides concurred that this was the best course of action, and agreed that he should shortly thereafter go to Washington D.C. and remain there until King could be buried. Kennedy also spoke over the phone with Coretta Scott King, King's widow, in Atlanta. At her request, Kennedy directed aide Frank Mankiewicz to arrange for a plane to retrieve King's body. Since most air carriers were wary of taking <b>up</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> task, a plane was chartered from one of Kennedy's friends. John Lewis and Earl Graves, among others, were dispatched to assist Coretta Scott King. Kennedy also had three additional phone lines installed at the King residence to handle the influx of incoming calls while his staff established a phone bank at West Hunter Baptist Church in Atlanta for the King family's use.|$|E
5|$|The {{plaintiff}} in Lines International {{argued that the}} guidelines adopted by the multi-agency committee {{set up by the}} PSA, STPB and GSB were invalid as the committee had no existence at law. The High Court held that there was nothing unlawful or even intrinsically wrong with these government agencies setting <b>up</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> committee to discuss matters of relevance to their respective jurisdictions as long as each agency made its own decisions within the ambit of its own statutory powers. The notion that such a committee fettered PSA's discretion was dismissed by a further finding of fact that the ad-hoc committee had not acted as an entity in itself. Enforcement and appropriate action were left to the agencies. A meeting attended by the plaintiff's representatives at which the guidelines relating to cruises-to-nowhere were announced was facilitated by a moderator rather than a chairperson, and each of the agencies read out guidelines which they themselves would be adopting and implementing.|$|E

25|$|In July 1953, whilst on the General staff, Dayan was {{party to}} the setting up of Unit 101, which was to specialise in night-time {{cross-border}} retaliation raids. He was initially opposed to setting <b>up</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> group because he argued it would undermine his attempts to prepare the IDF for an offensive war. Unit 101's first official operation was to attack, on 28 August 1953, the Bureij Refugee Camp, during which they killed 20 refugees.|$|E
25|$|The biomass of Antarctic krill is {{estimated}} to be 125 to 725 million tonnes. The reason Antarctic krill are able to build <b>up</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> high biomass and production is that the waters around the icy Antarctic continent harbour one of the largest plankton assemblages in the world, possibly the largest. The ocean is filled with phytoplankton; as the water rises from the depths to the light-flooded surface, it brings nutrients from all of the world's oceans back into the photic zone where they are once again available to living organisms.|$|E
25|$|Ross saw {{the great}} need for steel, {{and formed a}} {{syndicate}} to buy the Dominion Coal Company. Investing in further shares independently, Ross built <b>up</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> huge stake in Dominion Coal that {{he was invited to}} join the board of the Dominion Iron and Steel Company. However, his influence could not resolve a long contract dispute between the two for the supply of high-grade coal at a disadvantageous price, which resulted in a case review at the High Court of Justice in London, England. Although fault was found on both sides, the contract was found to be legal. Ross resigned from both boards, thus allowing a later merger between the two companies.|$|E

25|$|The case {{proceedings}} commenced on 5 May 1930 in Poonch House, Lahore against 18 accused. On 20 June 1930, {{the makeup}} of the Special Tribunal was changed to Justice G. C. Hilton (president), Justice J. K. Tapp, and Justice Sir Abdul Qadir. On 2 July 1930, a habeas corpus petition was filed in the High Court challenging the ordinance {{on the grounds that it}} was ultra vires and, therefore, illegal; the Viceroy had no powers to shorten the customary process of determining justice. The petition argued that the Defence of India Act 1915 allowed the Viceroy to introduce an ordinance, and set <b>up</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> tribunal, only under conditions of a breakdown of law-and-order, which, it was claimed in this case, had not occurred. However, the petition was dismissed as being premature.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 {{concerns}} over workshare appeared. Since {{the formation of}} Eurofighter the workshare split had been agreed at 33/33/21/13 (United Kingdom/Germany/Italy/Spain) {{based on the number}} of units being ordered by each contributing nation, all the nations then reduced their orders. The UK cut its orders from 250 to 232, Germany from 250 to 140, Italy from 165 to 121 and Spain from 100 to 87. According to these order levels the workshare split should have been 39/24/22/15 UK/Germany/Italy/Spain, however Germany was unwilling to give <b>up</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large amount of work. In January 1996, after much negotiation between German and UK partners, a compromise was reached whereby Germany would purchase another 40 aircraft. The workshare split was 43% for EADS MAS in Germany and Spain; 37.5% BAE Systems in the UK; and 19.5% for Alenia in Italy.|$|E
25|$|Robertson {{wrote to}} Haig (28 February) that Lloyd George was “an awful liar” for {{claiming}} that the French had originated the proposal (the Prime Minister had in fact met Major Berthier de Sauvigny (15 February), a French liaison officer in London, telling him that Haig needed to be subordinated to Nivelle for the offensive and that if necessary he would be replaced), and that he lacked the “honesty & truth” to remain Prime Minister. Haig claimed (3 March) that with the BEF spread more thinly by having recently taken over line to the south, German forces (they had recently added 300 battalions by more intensive mobilisation, and by withdrawing to the Hindenburg Line would later free up an extra 15–20 divisions (135 -180 battalions)) {{might be used to}} attack at Ypres and cut him off from the Channel Ports. The French assumed Haig was inventing this threat (possibly true – in the summer of 1917 Haig’s staff confessed to MacDonogh of playing <b>up</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> threat to avoid cooperating with the French).|$|E

[...] The following year, Morrison finally released some of his previously unissued studio recordings in a two-disc set, The Philosopher's Stone.

[...] While Setchfield was {{not a fan of}} Kay, he found his performance in this episode funny. IGN's Ahsan Haque gave the episode a score of 9.5 out of 10, particularly praising the dialogue. However, he felt that some of the sadder aspects [...] "seemed out of place in {{what should have been a}} purely light-hearted comedic episode".

500|$|On August 5, the HMS Falcon, {{commanded}} by John Linzee, appeared off Ipswich Bay. Captain Linzee sent a barge {{of men to}} the shore in search of livestock, hove to, and sent a barge containing about 50 men ashore to secure a supply of mutton from, the flock of sheep grazing on the Coffin farm at West Gloucester. Major Coffin observed their movements and anticipated their design. He hastily gathered some half dozen men, armed them with rifles and, concealed behind sand mounds, kept <b>up</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> brisk firing that the sailors in the barge, supposing that a large company were ready to receive them, thought it prudent to desist from their sheep foraging intentions {{and returned to the}} [...] "Falcon". When the barge returned to the Falcon, Linzee sent it to investigate a schooner in the harbor; this ship turned out to only contain ballast. [...] Linzee continued to cruise off Cape Ann for the next few days, and impressed some men from local ports and ships.|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{invented the}} {{lightning}} rod {{based on what}} he learned from experiments with his electrostatic machine. [...] Franklin and his associates observed that pointed objects were more effective than blunt objects at [...] "drawing off" [...] and [...] "throwing off" [...] sparks from static electricity. This discovery was first reported by Hopkinson. Franklin wondered if this discovery could be used in a practical invention. [...] He thought something could be made to attract the electricity out of storm clouds, but first he had to verify that lightning bolts really are giant electric sparks. He wrote Collinson and Cadwallader Colden letters about this theory. The 1752 Franklin letter to Collinson of October 19 of the kite experiment is noted by historian LeMay as a basis how it proved that lightning was electricity. Tom Tucker of the Isothermal Community College doubts the account however because of ambiguities in the account and points that out in his book Bolt of Fate: Benjamin Franklin and his Electric Kite Hoax. Others disagree with this view, arguing that Franklin would not make <b>up</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> fake story because he valued the integrity of the scientific community.|$|E

500|$|In 1804, George's {{recurrent}} illness returned; {{after his}} recovery, Addington resigned and Pitt regained power. Pitt sought to appoint Fox to his ministry, but George III refused.

This Third Coalition, however, met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions, collapsing in 1805. The setbacks in Europe took a toll on Pitt's health and he died in 1806, reopening {{the question of who}} should serve in the ministry. Lord Grenville became Prime Minister, and his [...] "Ministry of All the Talents" [...] included Fox. The King was conciliatory towards Fox, after being forced to capitulate over his appointment. After Fox's death in September 1806, the King and ministry were in open conflict. To boost recruitment, the ministry proposed a measure in February 1807 whereby Roman Catholics would be allowed to serve in all ranks of the Armed Forces. George instructed them not only to drop the measure, but also to agree never to set <b>up</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> measure again. The ministers agreed to drop the measure then pending, but refused to bind themselves in the future. They were dismissed and replaced by the Duke of Portland as the nominal Prime Minister, with actual power being held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Spencer Perceval. Parliament was dissolved, and the subsequent election gave the ministry a strong majority in the House of Commons. George III made no further major political decisions during his reign; the replacement of the Duke of Portland by Perceval in 1809 was of little actual significance.|$|E
