5|$|The 1973 CECAFA Cup was {{the inaugural}} {{edition of the}} CECAFA Cup, and was held in <b>Uganda.</b> The CECAFA Cup is {{considered}} Africa's oldest football tournament, and involves teams from Central and Southern Africa. The matches in the 1973 tournament were played from 22 September 1973 until 29 September 1973. The tournament was originally the Gossage Cup, contested by the four nations of Kenya, <b>Uganda,</b> Tanzania, and Zanzibar, running from 1929 until 1965. In 1967, this became the East and Central African Senior Challenge Cup, often shortened to simply the Challenge Cup, which was competed for five years, until 1971, before the CECAFA Cup was introduced in 1973. <b>Uganda,</b> the hosts, won the Cup, beating Tanzania 2–1 in the final. The tournament lacked a third-place play-off, so the runners-up in the group stages, Kenya and Zambia, shared third place. After <b>Uganda</b> and Zambia drew in the group stages with {{the same number of}} points, goals conceded and goals scored, a play-off occurred, which <b>Uganda</b> won. The tournament has been expanded, and the modern-day tournament consists of 12 different teams (Ethiopia, South Sudan, Burundi, Rwanda, Sudan, and Eritrea have joined since 1973).|$|E

40|$|Abstract The nexus between <b>Uganda’s</b> {{contemporary}} art and politics forms the overarching {{theme of this}} thesis. The trajectory of <b>Uganda’s</b> {{contemporary art}} as a political expression has been retraced. The different political dispensations which have shaped <b>Uganda’s</b> political art have been analysed. The political postures and visual symbols <b>Uganda’s</b> contemporary artists have engaged have been analysed {{in the context of}} the wider socio-political discussions which have shaped, and been shaped by, the country. It has been contended that different political epochs have invited response from <b>Uganda’s</b> artists since the early- 1940 s. Whereas this debate has been attempted by varied scholars, it has not been rigorously pursued. Formalist discourses seeking to prioritise formal aesthetics have been engaged; conclusions that after 1986 contemporary Ugandan art[ists] became apolitical have been made. With emphasis on two contemporary artists—Fred Kato Mutebi and Bruno Sserunkuuma—this formalist reading has been decentred; the socio-political relevance of <b>Uganda’s</b> contemporary art has been retraced and prioritised. It has been argued that although initially depoliticised through colonial modernity, <b>Uganda’s</b> contemporary artists have been sensitive to the socio-political conditions affecting their space and time; issues of governance and service delivery have preoccupied them albeit in different but often complementary ways...|$|R
