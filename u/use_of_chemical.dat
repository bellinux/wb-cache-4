5|$|An {{immediate}} concern of environmentalists was the potential <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> dispersants. To keep big slicks from washing ashore, dispersants {{can be used}} to break the oil into small droplets that disperse throughout the water column. There are significant concerns about the health effects of the dispersants and the effects on aquatic life. Coast Guard officials overseeing the cleanup indicated that no chemical dispersants were being used but did not immediately rule the use of them out.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage may {{extend beyond}} an {{aircraft}}'s airframe. High-flying aircraft {{can sometimes be}} detected by their vapor contrails. Researchers have considered whether these might be reduced with the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> additives. Work was carried out on a contrail management system for B-2 stealth bombers in 1994. From the Second World War onwards, reconnaissance pilots took care to avoid creating contrails, varying their altitude as necessary; the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was equipped with a mirror to enable the pilot {{to see if the}} plane was creating a contrail, and to take action accordingly.|$|E
5|$|In October 1935, Italian {{dictator}} Benito Mussolini sent 400,000 {{troops to}} invade Abyssinia (Ethiopia). Marshal Pietro Badoglio led the campaign from November 1935, ordering bombing, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons such as mustard gas, and the poisoning of water supplies, against targets which included undefended villages and medical facilities. The modern Italian Army defeated the poorly armed Abyssinians and captured Addis Ababa in May 1936, forcing Emperor of Ethiopia Haile Selassie to flee.|$|E
40|$|The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> {{is common}} in various {{aquaculture}} systems, {{as it is in}} many agricultural practices. However, with growing worldwide awareness of the need for responsible practices in aquaculture, governments and aquaculturists are increasingly concerned with the effects <b>of</b> the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> in aquaculture, especially those which appear likely to be hazardous to man, cultured stock and/or the environment. The need to synthesize and disseminate information on the <b>use</b> and management <b>of</b> double prime aquachemicals double prime was recognized by the Fishery Resources Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC) Aquaculture Department, who convened double prime The Expert Meeting on the <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chemicals</b> in Aquaculture in Asia, double prime which was held 20 - 22 May 1996 at the SEAFDEC facilities in Tigbauan, Iloilo, the Philippines. Support was provided by FAO, SEAFDEC and the Canadian International Development Agency s (CIDA) ASEAN Fund. The World Health Organization (WHO) supported the participation of a human health expert. The meeting was attended by 27 participants and more than 70 observers from {{the public and private sectors}} of 20 countries. Among the attendees were representatives from the Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific (NACA), the Fish Health Section of the Asian Fisheries Society (FHS/AFS), the Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences (JIRCAS), the GESAMP Working Group on Environmental Impacts of Coastal Aquaculture, and the ICES Working Group on Environmental Interactions of Mariculture. The results of this expert workshop are presented in this volume. They include the texts of presentations on a wide range of topics (thematic reviews) related to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> in aquaculture, with emphasis on the Asian Region, as well as country overview papers summarizing the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> aquachemicals in Asian countries. The contributions of the selected participants during the meeting are contained in this volume. AQUACHEM was funded by the Government of the Philippines through SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the Canadian International Development Agency through the ASEAN-Canada Fund. Dr. Efren Ed. C. Flores, former Chief of SEAFDEC AQD, laid down the ground-work for the smooth conduct of the meeting as well as solicited funds to support data gathering and travel of some participants from the ASEAN countries. We thank Milagros T. CastaÃ±os and Renelle Ivy Y. Adan of the Development Communications Unit, SEAFDEC, who helped in the lay-out of this proceedings.

5|$|Carbon {{metabolism}} in bacteria {{is either}} heterotrophic, where organic carbon compounds {{are used as}} carbon sources, or autotrophic, meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide. Heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic types. Typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic cyanobacteria, green sulfur-bacteria and some purple bacteria, but also many chemolithotrophic species, such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising bacteria. Energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on phototrophy, the use of light through photosynthesis, or based on chemotrophy, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> substances for energy, which are mostly oxidised {{at the expense of}} oxygen or alternative electron acceptors (aerobic/anaerobic respiration).|$|E
5|$|The {{trend towards}} more {{intensive}} farming {{began to be}} partially reversed {{by the end of}} the century as more environmentally friendly practices were encouraged by government and European Union grants. For example, Richard Zawadzki, owner of Balfour Mains (the largest farm on the island), ceased to breed livestock (instead keeping animals bred elsewhere) and grew less grain (some barley is still grown on the farm). Instead, some of the land is now managed under a Habitat Creation Scheme, which aims to encourage natural vegetation, wild flowers and nesting birds by limiting grazing and reducing the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> fertilisers.|$|E

5|$|World War I was {{the most}} devastating in British {{military}} history, with nearly 800,000 men killed and over twomillion wounded. Early in the war, the BEF was virtually destroyed and was replaced first by volunteers and then a conscript force. Major battles included those at the Somme and Passchendaele. Advances in technology saw {{the advent of the}} tank (and the creation of the Royal Tank Regiment) and advances in aircraft design (including the creation of the Royal Flying Corps) which would be decisive in future battles. Trench warfare dominated Western Front strategy for most of the war, and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons (disabling and poison gases) added to the devastation.|$|E
5|$|Some ant {{species are}} {{considered}} as pests, primarily those {{that occur in}} human habitations, where their presence is often problematic. For example, the presence of ants would be undesirable in sterile places such as hospitals or kitchens. Some species or genera commonly categorized as pests include the Argentine ant, pavement ant, yellow crazy ant, banded sugar ant, Pharaoh ant, carpenter ants, odorous house ant, red imported fire ant, and European fire ant. Some ants will raid stored food, others may damage indoor structures, some can damage agricultural crops directly (or by aiding sucking pests), and some will sting or bite. The adaptive nature of ant colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions. Ant populations are managed {{by a combination of}} approaches that make <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical,</b> biological and physical methods. Chemical methods include the use of insecticidal bait which is gathered by ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through trophallaxis. Management is based on the species and techniques can vary according to the location and circumstance.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of Syria's chemical weapons began in September 2013 {{on the basis}} of several international agreements with Syria that stipulated an initial destruction deadline of 30 June 2014. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 of 27 September 2013 required Syria to assume responsibility for and follow a timeline for the {{destruction of}} its chemical weapons and its chemical weapon production facilities. The resolution bound Syria to the implementation plan presented in a decision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). On 23 June 2014, the last declared chemical weapons were shipped out of Syria for destruction. The destruction of the most dangerous chemical weapons was performed at sea aboard the Cape Ray, a vessel of the United States Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force, crewed with U.S. civilian merchant mariners. The actual destruction operations, performed by a team of U.S. Army civilians and contractors, destroyed 600 metric tons of chemical agents in 42 days. However, despite these efforts, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons in Syria have continued to be reported, with the latest being the chemical attack on Khan Shaykhun in April 2017, which has been alleged to have been perpetrated by the Syrian government.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Accum's publications {{were written in}} English. They were executed in a style that made them quite accessible to the common man. Many scientific contributions were brought forth through his writings, which were influential in the popularization of chemistry during this era. In 1820, Accum published Treatise on Adulteration of Food, in which he denounced the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> additives to food. This ground-breaking work {{marked the beginning of}} an awareness of need for food safety oversight. Accum {{was the first person to}} tackle the subject and to reach a wide audience through his activities. His book, controversial at the time, found a wide audience and sold well. However, it threatened established practices within the food processing industry, earning him many enemies among the London food manufacturers. Accum left England after a lawsuit was brought against him. He lived out the rest of his life as a teacher at an industrial institution in Berlin.|$|E

25|$|The first {{successful}} use of poison gas {{as a weapon}} of warfare occurred during the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April – 25 May 1915). Gas was soon used by all major belligerents throughout the war. It is estimated that the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons employed by both sides throughout the war had inflicted 1.3 million casualties. For example, the British had over 180,000 chemical weapons casualties during the war, and up to one-third of American casualties were caused by them. The Russian Army reportedly suffered roughly 500,000 chemical weapon casualties in World War I. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons in warfare was in direct violation of the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which prohibited their use.|$|E
