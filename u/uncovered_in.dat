5|$|From 1909 onwards, Kentrosaurus {{remains were}} <b>uncovered</b> <b>in</b> four {{quarries}} in the Mittlere Saurierschichten (Middle Saurian Beds) and one quarry in the Obere Saurierschichten (Upper Saurian Beds). During four field seasons, the German Expedition found over 1200 bones of Kentrosaurus, belonging to about fifty individuals, {{many of which}} were destroyed during the Second World War. Today, almost all remaining material is housed in the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin (roughly 350 remaining specimens), while the museum of the Institute for Geosciences of the Eberhard-Karls-University Tübingen houses a composite mount, roughly 50% of it being original bones.|$|E

Many of the drugs in use today were originally <b>uncovered</b> <b>in</b> microbes; recent progress in mining the rich genetic resource of non-culturable microbes has led to the discovery of new genes, enzymes, and natural products. The application of metagenomics has allowed the development of commodity and fine chemicals, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals where the benefit of enzyme-catalyzed chiral synthesis is increasingly recognized.|$|E

5|$|The {{very limited}} archaeological record {{provides}} little {{to suggest that}} culture in Scotland caught up with developing societies to the south {{during this period of}} improved climatic conditions. Some finds nonetheless indicate the presence of relatively large and well-organised hunter-gatherer societies. No Mesolithic burial sites have been <b>uncovered</b> <b>in</b> Scotland to date. Substantial finds at the village of Dunragit were announced in 2014 including arrowheads, urns and bead necklaces from the Mesolithic. Initial press reports provided no firm dates for these artefacts.|$|E
5|$|After {{several hundred}} years of no {{permanent}} habitation, the second wave of migration arrived from Canada, bringing the Dorset people to western Greenland. The first wave of immigrants, known as Dorset I, arrived around 500 BCE, inhabiting the region for the next 700 years. The early Dorset people were followed later by the Dorset II people, although no artifacts have been discovered from the later era around Sisimiut, and few artifacts from the era of Dorset I have been <b>uncovered</b> <b>in</b> archaeological sites, with the finds often limited to harpoon heads and numerous animal bones. The largest number of Dorset culture artifacts can be found further north in the Disko Bay region, while the further to the south, the poorer the finds, disappearing completely {{on the coast of}} Labrador Sea in southwestern Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Mamucium was {{levelled}} as Manchester {{expanded in}} the Industrial Revolution.

When the railway viaducts were built, Charles Roeder documented the remains that were <b>uncovered</b> <b>in</b> the process, including parts of the vicus. Mills were all around the site.
