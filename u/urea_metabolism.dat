40|$|Urea is {{the primary}} {{precursor}} of the carcinogen ethyl carbamate in fermented foods. Understanding <b>urea</b> <b>metabolism</b> is important for controlling ethyl carbamate production. Using Chinese liquor as a model system, we used metatranscriptome analysis to investigate <b>urea</b> <b>metabolism</b> in spontaneous food fermentation processes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was dominant in gene transcription for urea biosynthesis and degradation. Lysinibacillus sphaericus was dominant for urea degradation. S. cerevisiae degraded 18 % and L. sphaericus degraded 13 % of urea in their corresponding single cultures, whereas they degraded 56 % of urea in coculture after 12 h. Compared to single cultures, transcription of CAR 1, DAL 2, and argA, which are related to urea biosynthesis, decreased by 51, 36, and 69 % in coculture, respectively. Transcription of DUR 1 and ureA, which are related to urea degradation, increased by 227 and 70 %, respectively. Thus, coexistence of the two strains promoted degradation of urea via transcriptional regulation of genes related to <b>urea</b> <b>metabolism.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|T-strain mycoplasmas require urea for propagation, but <b>urea</b> <b>{{metabolism}}</b> also {{occurs in}} nonpropagating viable cultures.

40|$|SummaryThe {{identification}} of mutated metabolic enzymes in hereditary cancer syndromes {{has established a}} direct link between metabolic dysregulation and cancer. Mutations in the Krebs cycle enzyme, fumarate hydratase (FH), predispose affected individuals to leiomyomas, renal cysts, and cancers, though the respective pathogenic roles of mitochondrial and cytosolic FH isoforms remain undefined. On the basis of comprehensive metabolomic analyses, we demonstrate that FH 1 -deficient cells and tissues exhibit defects in the <b>urea</b> cycle/arginine <b>metabolism.</b> Remarkably, transgenic re-expression of cytosolic FH ameliorated both renal cyst development and urea cycle defects associated with renal-specific FH 1 deletion in mice. Furthermore, acute arginine depletion significantly reduced the viability of FH 1 -deficient cells in comparison to controls. Our findings highlight the importance of extramitochondrial metabolic pathways in FH-associated oncogenesis and the <b>urea</b> cycle/arginine <b>metabolism</b> as a potential therapeutic target...|$|R

40|$|<b>Urea</b> <b>metabolism</b> was {{studied with}} nitrogen-starved cells of Chlorella vulgaris Beijerinck var. viridis (Chodat), a green alga which {{apparently}} lacks urease. Incorporation of radioactivity from urea- 14 C into the alcohol-soluble fraction was virtually eliminated in cell suspensions flushed with 10 % CO 2 in air. This same result was obtained when expected acceptors of urea carbon were replenished by adding ornithine and glucose with the urea. Several carbamyl compounds, {{which might be}} early products of <b>urea</b> <b>metabolism</b> {{and a source of}} the 14 CO 2, were not appreciably labeled. If cells were treated with cyanide at a concentration which inhibited ammonia uptake completely and urea uptake only slightly, {{more than half of the}} urea nitrogen taken up was found in the medium as ammonia. Cells under nitrogen gas in the dark were unable to take up urea or ammonia, but the normal rate of uptake was resumed in light. Since 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea did not selectively inhibit this uptake, an active respiration supported by light-dependent oxygen evolution in these cells was ruled out. A tentative scheme for <b>urea</b> <b>metabolism</b> is proposed to consist of an initial energy-dependent splitting of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia. This reaction in Chlorella is thought to differ from a typical urease-catalyzed reaction by the apparent requirement of a high energy compound, possibly adenosine triphosphate...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} our {{understanding}} of the control of ion and <b>urea</b> <b>metabolism</b> in elasmobranch fish has increased with many more species being investigated. This has demonstrated that some species regarded previously as stenohaline marine are, at least partially, euryhaline and may survive in environments less concentrated than full seawater. In elasmobranch fish the success of the osmotic strategy depends on retaining large concentrations of plasma urea in addition to relatively high, in comparison to most other vertebrates, plasma concentrations of sodium and chloride. The strategy therefore depends on the integrated control of hepatic urea production and branchial and renal urea excretion and also on a balance of salt input at the gills and gut with salt output at the gills, kidney and via the unique elasmobranch rectal gland. This integrated response is, at least in part, controlled by a series of osmoregulatory hormones and their possible role in the control of osmoregulatory organs will be discussed. In this presentation recent findings will be reviewed and the osmoregulatory strategies of a partially euryhaline species, Scyliorhinus canicula, with a fully euryhaline migratory species, Carcharhinus leucas, will be compared.

40|$|To summarise, {{evidence}} suggests that protein-energy malnutrition is associated with mor-bidity and mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients.

40|$|Hemiascomycetes, {{including}} the pathogen Candida albicans, acquire nitrogen from urea using the urea amidolyase Dur 1, 2, whereas all other higher fungi use primarily the nickel-containing urease. <b>Urea</b> <b>metabolism</b> via Dur 1, 2 {{is important for}} resistance to innate host immunity in C. albicans infections. To further characterize <b>urea</b> <b>metabolism</b> in C. albicans we examined the function of seven putative urea transporters. Gene disruption established that Dur 3, encoded by orf 19. 781, is the predominant transporter. [14 C]Urea uptake was energy-dependent and decreased approximately sevenfold in a dur 3 D mutant. DUR 1, 2 and DUR 3 expression was strongly induced by urea, whereas the other putative transporter genes were induced less than twofold. Immediate induction of DUR 3 by urea was independent of its metabolism via Dur 1, 2, but further slow induction of DUR 3 required the Dur 1, 2 pathway. We investigated {{the role of the}} GATA transcription factors Gat 1 and Gln 3 in DUR 1, 2 and DUR 3 expression. Urea induction of DUR 1, 2 was reduced in a gat 1 D mutant, strongly reduced in a gln 3 D mutant, and abolished in a gat 1 D gln 3 D double mutant. In contrast, DUR 3 induction by urea was preserved in both single mutants but reduced in the double mutant, suggesting that additional signalling mechanisms regulate DUR 3 expression. These results establish Dur 3 as the major urea transporter in C. albicans and provide additional insights into the control of urea utilization by this pathogen...|$|E
40|$|Rice (Oryza sativa) {{production}} relies strongly on nitrogen (N) fertilization with urea, but {{the proteins}} involved in rice <b>urea</b> <b>metabolism</b> {{have not yet}} been characterized. Coding sequences for rice arginase, urease, and the urease accessory proteins D (UreD), F (UreF), and G (UreG) involved in urease activation were identified and cloned. The functionality of urease and the urease accessory proteins was demonstrated by complementing corresponding Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants and by multiple transient coexpression of the rice proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana. Secondary structure models of rice (plant) UreD and UreF proteins revealed a possible functional conservation to bacterial orthologs, especially for UreF. Using amino-terminally StrepII-tagged urease accessory proteins, an interaction between rice UreD and urease could be shown. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic urease activation complexes seem conserved despite limited protein sequence conservation for UreF and UreD. In plant metabolism, urea is generated by the arginase reaction. Rice arginase was transiently expressed as a carboxyl-terminally StrepII-tagged fusion protein in N. benthamiana, purified, and biochemically characterized (Km = 67 mm, kcat = 490 s− 1). The activity depended on the presence of manganese (Kd = 1. 3 μm). In physiological experiments, urease and arginase activities were not influenced by the external N source, but sole urea nutrition imbalanced the plant amino acid profile, leading to the accumulation of asparagine and glutamine in the roots. Our data indicate that reduced plant performance with urea as N source is not a direct result of insufficient <b>urea</b> <b>metabolism</b> but may in part be caused by an imbalance of N distribution...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} if plasma metabolic profiles can detect differences between patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD) and similarly-aged controls. Metabolomic analysis using liquid chromatography with Fourier-transform mass spectrometry (LC-FTMS) {{was performed on}} plasma samples from 26 NVAMD patients and 19 controls. Data were collected from mass/charge ratio (m/z) 85 to 850 on a Thermo LTQ-FT mass spectrometer, and metabolic features were extracted using an adaptive processing software package. Both non-transformed and log 2 transformed data were corrected using Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) to account for multiple testing. Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis was performed to determine metabolic features that distinguished NVAMD patients from controls. Individual m/z features were matched to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database and the Metlin metabolomics database, and metabolic pathways associated with NVAMD were identified using MetScape. Of the 1680 total m/z features detected by LC-FTMS, 94 unique m/z features were significantly different between NVAMD patients and controls using FDR (q = 0. 05). A comparison of these features to those found with log 2 transformed data (n = 132, q = 0. 2) revealed 40 features in common, reaffirming the involvement of certain metabolites. Such metabolites included di- and tripeptides, covalently modified amino acids, bile acids, and vitamin D-related metabolites. Correlation analysis revealed associations among certain significant features, and pathway analysis demonstrated broader changes in tyrosine metabolism, sulfur amino acid metabolism, and amino acids related to <b>urea</b> <b>metabolism.</b> These data suggest that metabolomic analysis can identify a panel of individual metabolites that differ between NVAMD cases and controls.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common inborn error of <b>urea</b> <b>metabolism</b> that can lead to hyperammonemic crises and orotic aciduria. To date, a total of 341 causative mutations within the OTC gene have been described. However, in about 20 % of the patients with enzymatically confirmed OTC deficiency no mutation can be detected when sequencing of genomic DNA analyzing exons and adjacent intronic segments of the OTC gene is performed. METHODS: Standard genomic DNA analysis of the OTC gene in five consecutive patients from five families revealed no mutation. Hence, liver tissue was obtained by needle sampling or open biopsy and RNA extracted from liver was analyzed. RESULTS: Complex rearrangements of the OTC transcript (three insertions and two deletions) were found in all five patients. CONCLUSION: In patients with a strong suspicion of OTC deficiency despite normal results of sequencing exonic regions of the OTC gene, characterization of liver OTC mRNA is highly effective in resolving the genotype. Liver tissue sampling by needle aspiration allows for both enzymatic analysis and RNA based diagnostics of OTC deficiency...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Five {{patients}} with chronic renal failure taking a diet containing approximately 5 g N throughout were studied during two periods of 1 month each. Nitrogen balance, <b>urea</b> <b>metabolism,</b> and incorporation of ‘ 5 N from urea into albumin on diet alone or with a keto acid/ essential amino acid supplement were measured. Keto acids produced a reduction of plasma urea, urea synthesis, and urea excretion and an improvement in nitrogen balance. In patients who demonstrated the greatest change on ketoacids, ‘ 5 N incorporation also increased, but their total incorporation of urea nitrogen was not nearly sufficient {{to account for the}} improvement in nitrogen balance.
