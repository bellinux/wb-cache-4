5|$|Mining did {{not make}} up {{a large part of}} the English medieval economy, but the 12thand 13th centuries saw an {{increased}} demand for metals in the country, thanks to the considerable population growth and building construction, including the great cathedrals and churches. Four metals were mined commercially in England during the period, namely iron, tin, lead and silver; coal was also mined from the 13th century onwards, <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of refining techniques.|$|E
5|$|Printed pattern {{books were}} not easily obtainable, and a sampler or {{embroidered}} record of stitches and patterns {{was the most}} common form of reference. 16th-century English samplers were stitched on a narrow band of fabric and totally covered with stitches.

These samplers were stitched <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of needlework styles, threads, and ornament.|$|E

5|$|Born in Blackpool, Lancashire, Montalban {{moved to}} London {{in the early}} 1930s, {{immersing}} herself in the city's esoteric subculture, and influenced by Hermeticism she taught herself ceremonial magic. She associated with significant occultists, including Thelemites like Aleister Crowley and Kenneth Grant, and Wiccans like Gerald Gardner and Alex Sanders. From 1933 to 1953 she published articles on astrology and other esoteric topics in the magazine London Life, and from then until her death in the nationally syndicated magazine Prediction. These were accompanied by several booklets on astrology, released <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of different pseudonyms, including Dolores North, Madeline Alvarez and Nina del Luna.|$|E
5|$|During {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, electrons {{are transferred}} from electron donors to electron acceptors such as oxygen, in redox reactions. These redox reactions release energy, {{which is used}} to form ATP. In eukaryotes, these redox reactions are carried out by a series of protein complexes within the inner membrane of the cell's mitochondria, whereas, in prokaryotes, these proteins are located in the cells' intermembrane space. These linked sets of proteins are called electron transport chains. In eukaryotes, five main protein complexes are involved, whereas in prokaryotes many different enzymes are present, <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of electron donors and acceptors.|$|E
5|$|In {{political}} and sociocultural studies, monarchies are normally associated with hereditary rule; most monarchs, in both {{historical and contemporary}} contexts, have been born and raised within a royal family. Succession has been defined <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of distinct formulae, such as proximity of blood, primogeniture, and agnatic seniority. Some monarchies, however, are not hereditary, and the ruler is instead determined through an elective process; a modern example is the throne of Malaysia. These systems defy the model concept of a monarchy, but are commonly considered as such because they retain certain associative characteristics. Many systems {{use a combination of}} hereditary and elective elements, where the election or nomination of a successor is restricted to members of a royal bloodline.|$|E

5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of mitochondrial {{and nuclear}} genes places the Noronha skink among the tropical African species of Trachylepis, a position also supported by morphological similarities. It may have arrived on its island on rafting vegetation from southwestern Africa via the Benguela Current and the South Equatorial Current, which passes Fernando de Noronha. This possibility was first suggested by Alfred Russel Wallace before 1888. Mausfeld and coworkers {{calculated that the}} journey from Africa to Fernando de Noronha would take 139 days. Because this period seemed too long for the skink to survive, they proposed that the Noronha skink instead arrived via Ascension Island, where a skink may have persisted into historical times.|$|E

5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a herbivore, {{and almost}} the whole diet consists of grasses. Water {{is an essential}} requirement.
