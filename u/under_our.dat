500|$|The Natural History is encyclopaedic in scope, but its {{format is}} unlike a modern encyclopaedia. However, {{it does have}} structure: Pliny uses Aristotle's {{division}} of nature (animal, vegetable, mineral) to recreate the natural world in literary form.

[...] "This tragedy is alike distinguished for the lofty imagination it displays, and for the tumultuous vehemence of the action; and the one is made the moving principle of the other", Hazlitt writes. Macbeth [...] "moves upon the verge of an abyss, and is a constant struggle between life and death. The action is desperate and the reaction is dreadful.

Smith came from such a different background than his other three bandmates. Kiedis, Flea and Frusciante were more into the punk rock scene while Smith was into classic rock and heavy metal. Smith was officially hired in December 1988 and played a handful of shows with the band to finish out the year.|$|E
