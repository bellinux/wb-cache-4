5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the <b>undesired</b> effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E
5|$|Air is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of three characters. Much of its {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Air follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. With the consumer ports, if an <b>undesired</b> choice was selected, {{there would be an}} option to rewind the story to correct the mistake. However, if the player reaches a bad end to a storyline, the player does not have this option and must reload the game at the last saved point.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, a {{nationwide}} movement pressed {{to return to}} pre-war society {{as quickly as possible}} in the U.S. When combined with the increasing national paranoia about communism and psychoanalytic theory that had become pervasive in medical knowledge, homosexuality became an <b>undesired</b> characteristic of employees working for the U.S. government in 1950. Homosexuals were thought to be vulnerable targets to blackmail, and the government purged its employment ranks of open homosexuals, beginning a widespread effort to gather intelligence about employees' private lives. State and local governments followed suit, arresting people for congregating in bars and parks, and enacting laws against cross-dressing for men and women.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} biochemical reactions, such {{as energy}} generation, use concentration gradients across membranes. The {{general lack of}} internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space. However, in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane, or expel <b>undesired</b> molecules from the cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan forge to the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig iron in liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid phase is actually <b>undesired,</b> and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron and needs to be described to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of <b>undesired</b> effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E
5|$|Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in {{the early}} stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, {{individuals}} are expected to lose independent ambulation after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years. However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the <b>undesired</b> effects of levodopa after years of use. In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years. However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is the best predictor of disease progression. The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.|$|E
5|$|That hops {{could be}} used for {{flavoring}} beer had been known at least since Carolingian times, but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions. Before the widespread use of hops, gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used. Gruit had the same preserving properties as hops, though less reliable depending on what herbs were in it, and the end result was much more variable. Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content, but this was more expensive and lent the beer the <b>undesired</b> characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant. Hops may have been widely used in England in the tenth century; they were grown in Austria by 1208 and in Finland by 1249, and possibly much earlier.|$|E
5|$|The longest-lived {{and most}} {{abundant}} (nearly 100%) naturally occurring isotope of protactinium, protactinium-231, has a half-life of 32,760 {{years and is}} a decay product of uranium-235. Much smaller trace amounts of the short-lived nuclear isomer protactinium-234m occur in the decay chain of uranium-238. Protactinium-233 results from the decay of thorium-233 {{as part of the}} chain of events used to produce uranium-233 by neutron irradiation of thorium-232. It is an <b>undesired</b> intermediate product in thorium-based nuclear reactors and is therefore removed from the active zone of the reactor during the breeding process. Analysis of the relative concentrations of various uranium, thorium and protactinium isotopes in water and minerals is used in radiometric dating of sediments which are up to 175,000 years old and in modeling of various geological processes.|$|E
5|$|Visual effects {{producer}} James Tichenor {{claimed that}} visual effects work better when not highlighted, {{and that a}} major part of effective visual effects are the actors' reactions to nonexistent things. Replicator models were used to give the actors an idea at what they were looking and to match their eyelines. One model was mounted on a plexiglass rod and shown on-screen, giving the impression of an organic Replicator hologram. The computer-generated Replicators on board the submarine were tracked with small lights, some of which post-production left in for good looks. The reflections of the green screen on the floor aboard Thor's ship ("green spill", usually an <b>undesired</b> side effect) were used to key selective patches for the reflection of the big spaceship screen.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona {{would return}} to France six more times {{over the course of}} the next twelve years. Her {{frequent}} visits and excellent reputation made her the cause célèbre of many French citizens who pitied the queen's fate and admired her gracious acceptance of her new life. Ranavalona's visits were generally accompanied by much media fanfare and the queen's popularity among the French public grew to the extent that she was featured on the box of Petit Beurre cookies in 1916. The queen's second visit to France occurred in September 1903, when she visited Vic-sur-Cère and Aurillac. Pressure by citizens during this visit succeeded in raising her pension to 37,000 francs. Two years later she would visit Marseilles and Saint-Germain and inhabit a large five-bedroom Parisian apartment in the sixteenth arrondissement from which she would attend the Paris Opera, observe a session of the French House of Representatives and be formally received at the Ministry of the Colonies. Again due to pressure from sympathetic French citizens, Ranavalona's pension was further raised to 50,000 francs per annum. On her next visit in 1907, the queen would use Dives-sur-Mer as a home base to visit the Calvados region, where she was photographed for the French press. From August to September 1910, Ranavalona would visit Paris, Nantes, La Baule and Saint-Nazaire and was repeatedly the target of <b>undesired</b> attention from press photographers. Her 1912 trip to the tiny, remote village of Quiberville would coincide with the increase of her annual pension to 75,000 francs. The queen's final voyage in 1913 would take her to Marseilles, Aix-les-Bains and Allevard.|$|E
25|$|Unenriched {{sequencing}} libraries {{often have}} abundant <b>undesired</b> sequences. Cas9 can specifically deplete the <b>undesired</b> sequences with double strand breakage {{with up to}} 99% efficiency and without significant off-target effects as seen with restriction enzymes. Treatment with Cas9 can deplete abundant rRNA while increasing pathogen sensitivity in RNA-seq libraries.|$|E
25|$|On-Machine Simulation, {{to check}} for gouges, machine {{interference}} and other <b>undesired</b> behavior.|$|E
25|$|Ochel Mitoch Psolet (Good {{from the}} bad): The desired objects must be {{selected}} from the <b>undesired,</b> and not the reverse.|$|E
25|$|The Spinone {{should not}} have an undercoat. A long, soft or silky coat is <b>undesired</b> and {{is a sign of}} {{excessive}} grooming.|$|E
25|$|Linearization is an {{emergent}} field, {{and there}} are many techniques, such as feed forward, predistortion, postdistortion, {{in order to avoid the}} <b>undesired</b> effects of the non-linearities.|$|E
25|$|Any form of {{selecting}} from (or sorting of) an assorted mixture or combination can be borer. This includes removing <b>undesired</b> objects, or matter from a mixture or combination.|$|E
25|$|Animal control {{agencies}} in the United States and the ASPCA advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be spayed or neutered {{so that they do}} not have <b>undesired</b> puppies.|$|E
25|$|The {{dissipation}} {{of electrical}} energy is often <b>undesired,</b> {{particularly in the}} case of transmission losses in power lines. High voltage transmission helps reduce the losses by reducing the current for a given power.|$|E
25|$|A related use is for smoothing/denoising data {{based on}} wavelet {{coefficient}} thresholding, also called wavelet shrinkage. By adaptively thresholding the wavelet coefficients {{that correspond to}} <b>undesired</b> frequency components smoothing and/or denoising operations can be performed.|$|E
25|$|The sword {{carried by}} the Republic in the Marseillaise relief broke off on the day, it is said, that the Battle of Verdun began in 1916. The relief was {{immediately}} hidden by tarpaulins to conceal the accident and avoid any <b>undesired</b> ominous interpretations.|$|E
25|$|A {{casting defect}} is an <b>undesired</b> {{irregularity}} {{in a metal}} casting process. Some defects can be tolerated while others can be repaired, otherwise they must be eliminated. They are broken down into five main categories: gas porosity, shrinkage defects, mold material defects, pouring metal defects, and metallurgical defects.|$|E
25|$|The {{need to keep}} rodents from {{consuming}} or contaminating grain crops {{stored for}} later human consumption may be the original reason cats were domesticated. They are still commonly kept {{for the purpose of}} catching <b>undesired</b> vermin found on farms and ranches, which would otherwise eat or contaminate crops, especially grain or feed stocks.|$|E
25|$|Rumble {{filters are}} high-pass filters {{applied to the}} removal of {{unwanted}} sounds near to {{the lower end of}} the audible range or below. For example, noises (e.g., footsteps, or motor noises from record players and tape decks) may be removed because they are <b>undesired</b> or may overload the RIAA equalization circuit of the preamp.|$|E
25|$|The {{equipment}} failure, inadequate training, and miscalculated sea room theories were disproven {{by the two}} Royal Commissions, {{leaving the}} suggestion that either a communication error aboard one of the ships caused Voyager to manoeuvre in an <b>undesired</b> manner, or the officers aboard Voyager were incorrectly aware of their vessel's position {{in relation to the}} much larger aircraft carrier.|$|E
25|$|Deoxyribozymes {{obtained}} through in vitro selection will be optimized for the conditions during the selection, such as salt concentration, pH, {{and the presence}} of cofactors. Because of this, catalytic activity only in the presence of specific cofactors or other conditions can be achieved using positive selection steps, as well as negative selection steps against other <b>undesired</b> conditions.|$|E
25|$|A useful {{indicator}} for {{the progress}} of lateral lithiations {{is the color of}} the reaction mixture. Benzyllithium compounds range in color from red to deep purple, and in many cases the lack of a color change upon addition of an organolithium reagent to the substrate may indicate the presence of an <b>undesired</b> proton source in solution.|$|E
25|$|All class 2 ceramic {{capacitors}} using ferroelectric ceramics exhibit piezoelectricity, {{and have}} a piezoelectric effect called microphonics, microphony or in audio applications squealing. Microphony describes the phenomenon wherein electronic components transform mechanical vibrations into an electrical signal which in many cases is <b>undesired</b> noise. Sensitive electronic preamplifiers generally use class 1 capacitors to avoid this effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{monitoring}} device switches off {{the transmitter}} when the antenna shows incorrect behavior, e.g. {{as a result}} of <b>undesired</b> electrical charge. When the transmitter is switched off, these charges dissipate. The monitoring device makes several attempts to switch back on. If after several attempts the antenna continues to show improper behavior, possibly as result of structural damage, the transmitter remains switched off.|$|E
25|$|To some extent, it is {{possible}} to change testicular size. Short of direct injury or subjecting them to adverse conditions, e.g., higher temperature than they are normally accustomed to, they can be shrunk by competing against their intrinsic hormonal function through the use of externally administered steroidal hormones. Steroids taken for muscle enhancement (especially anabolic steroids) often have the <b>undesired</b> side effect of testicular shrinkage.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{degradation}} of objects occurs {{not in the}} physical structure of the object but rather in at the chemical or compound level. Compounds begin to breakdown into more simpler compounds and is often an <b>undesired</b> reaction. The {{degradation of}} the chemical component of an object will hinder or weaken {{the stability of the}} object when exposed to environmental factors such as water, air, pollution, heat, humidity, and the like.|$|E
25|$|The Banishers: Banishers are warped Mages who {{dedicate}} {{themselves to}} destroying other Mages. Generally speaking, their Awakening was traumatic, <b>undesired,</b> and misunderstood, {{and they do}} not accept their mystical powers. They exist outside of normal mage society, and are often obsessed with hunting and killing other mages, usually driven by a desire for repentance or a belief that doing so will cause their life to be returned to normal.|$|E
25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} to the {{superheterodyne receiver}} {{is the problem}} of image frequency. In heterodyne receivers, an image frequency is an <b>undesired</b> input frequency equal to the station frequency plus twice the intermediate frequency. The image frequency results in two stations being received at the same time, thus producing interference. Image frequencies can be eliminated by sufficient attenuation on the incoming signal by the RF amplifier filter of the superheterodyne receiver.|$|E
25|$|If {{the plasma}} is {{optically}} thin, the bremsstrahlung radiation leaves the plasma, carrying {{part of the}} internal plasma energy. This effect {{is known as the}} bremsstrahlung cooling. It is a type of radiative cooling. The energy carried away by bremsstrahlung is called bremsstrahlung losses and represents a type of radiative losses. One generally uses the term bremsstrahlung losses in the context when the plasma cooling is <b>undesired,</b> as e.g. in fusion plasmas.|$|E
25|$|Further, {{research}} has demonstrated that increased replacement of tropical rainforest vegetation with savanna grasslands can produce <b>undesired</b> climate changes in Africa. Forests are also providers of rainfall. The destruction of forest prevent such eco-services and lead to change in landscape. In areas that are heavily deforested, rainfall can decrease throughout the year; and specifically if over deforestation occurs in southern Africa, it may result in increased rainfall in the southern region of the DRC.|$|E
25|$|Many hedges do {{not involve}} exotic {{financial}} instruments or derivatives such as the married put. A natural hedge is an investment that reduces the <b>undesired</b> risk by matching cash flows (i.e. revenues and expenses). For example, an exporter to the United States faces a risk {{of changes in the}} value of the U.S. dollar and chooses to open a production facility in that market to match its expected sales revenue to its cost structure.|$|E
