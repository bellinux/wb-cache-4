With this increase, however, there is little consideration of users. <b>Usability</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a core tenet of public geographic information provision. The central principle of usability design is that “Any system designed for people to use <b>should</b> <b>be</b> easy to learn (and remember), useful, that is, contain functions people really need in their work, and be easy and pleasant to use” (Gould & Lewis 1985, 300).
