Texas Tech University has awarded over 200,000degrees since 1927, including over 40,000 graduate and professional degrees. The Carnegie Foundation classifies Texas Tech as having [...] "highest research activity". Research projects {{in the areas of}} epidemiology, pulsed power, grid computing, nanophotonics, atmospheric sciences, and wind energy are among the most prominent at the university. The Spanish Renaissance-themed campus, described by author James Michener as [...] "the most beautiful west of the Mississippi <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Stanford", has been awarded the Grand Award for excellence in grounds-keeping, and has been noted for possessing a public art collection among the ten best in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Stone {{wanted to}} shoot the movie in New York City and that {{required}} a budget of at least $15 million, a moderate shooting budget by 1980s standards. The studio that backed Platoon {{felt that it was}} too risky a project to bankroll and passed. Stone and producer Edward R. Pressman took it to 20th Century Fox and filming began in April 1987 and ended on July 4 of the same year. According to Stone, he was [...] "making a movie about sharks, about feeding frenzies. Bob [...] and I wanted the camera to become a predator. There is no letup <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the fixed world of Charlie’s father, where the stationary camera gives you a sense of immutable values". The director saw Wall Street as a battle zone and [...] "filmed it as such" [...] including shooting conversations like physical confrontations and in ensemble shots had the camera circle the actors [...] "in a way that makes you feel you're in a pool with sharks".|$|E
500|$|The Lubbock {{campus is}} home to the main {{academic}} university, law school, and medical school (Health Sciences Center). This arrangement makes it the only institution in Texas to have all three units (undergraduate institution, law school, and medical school) on the same campus. The campus, which boasts Spanish Renaissance architecture, was described by American author James A. Michener as the [...] "most beautiful west of the Mississippi <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Stanford" [...] and by Stewart Mandel of Sports Illustrated as [...] "easily one of the ten most beautiful campuses" [...] he had seen. Many buildings on campus borrow architectural elements from those found at University de Alcalá in Alcalá de Henares, Spain, and Mission San José in San Antonio. A large section of the campus built between 1924 and 1951 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Texas Technological College Historic District. This area is roughly bounded by 6th Street on the north, University Avenue on the east, 19th Street on the south, and Flint Street on the west. In 2008, the Professional Grounds Management Society awarded Texas Tech the Grand Award for excellence in grounds-keeping, and merit awards in 2007, 2010, and 2014.|$|E

[...] "If the Chinese government tries to play down this incident, there will be no social stability in China, let alone harmony... It will mean that this government has lost the most basic level of trust." ...|$|E
2500|$|About 150 {{yards from}} the top the men began a maniacal rush toward the top. Bigelow was hit but {{continued}} to urge his men forward. He was then hit in quick succession by three Spanish bullets which caused him to fall. Several soldiers present reported that he encouraged them with, [...] "Men, don't stop for me, just keep up the charge <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> {{the top of the}} hill."

2500|$|Captain Bigelow led his {{soldiers}} {{up the steep}} slopes to the heights of San Juan Hill. Advancing through blistering fire, Bigelow was hit but continued to urge his men forward.

2500|$|... "Wolf fence" [...] algorithm: Edward Gauss {{described}} this simple but very useful and now famous algorithm in a 1982 article for communications of the ACM as follows: [...] "There's one wolf in Alaska; {{how do you}} find it? First build a fence {{down the middle of the}} state, wait for the wolf to howl, determine which side of the fence it is on. Repeat process on that side only, <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the point where you can see the wolf." [...] This is implemented e.g. in the Git version control system as the command git bisect, which uses the above algorithm to determine which commit introduced a particular bug.|$|E
2500|$|Game Revolution's Duke Ferris {{scored the}} game a B+, praising the graphics, but criticizing the {{difficulty}} level, writing [...] "you have unlimited lives in MDK2, {{and it is}} a strictly linear game with fixed checkpoints. This means that when you get to a hard section, your only choice is to do {{it over and over again}} <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the next checkpoint. After playing the exact same level for the 30th time, this can get frustrating." [...] However, he concluded, [...] "the non-frustrating times in MDK 2 are simply tons of fun. The game is genuinely funny, has great voices and a terrific comic book flair." ...|$|E

60|$|It is surprising, too, {{how quickly}} the moon can {{go out on the}} stage. At one moment it is riding in full {{radiance}} {{in the midst of a}} cloudless sky, and the next instant it is gone!

500|$|Another {{element of}} game {{mechanics}} which received significant criticism was the game's handling of space flight.

He does indeed bounce {{about a little}} when we burst away at first, and is apt then <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the bit in his teeth; but you've only to keep a tight rein and he'll go all right. His only fault is a habit of tossing his head, {{which is a little}} awkward <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> used <b>to</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'When you book your passage you {{can arrange}} for the buggy {{to be taken}} up,' said the storekeeper. 'You might put all the things in it. We shall put all the small items in boxes, and then lash the {{tarpaulin}} well over everything; they will travel safely enough, {{and you will have}} no trouble about them till you {{get to the end of}} the journey.

6000|$|A {{minute later}} the {{lieutenant}} said, [...] "Mr. Morrison, take {{a dozen men}} and make your way along the path <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the boats. I hope they have escaped. If they are within hail go on board, and report to the captain that we have sunk two of the prahus, and that for the present the Malays who have been attacking us have made off.

6000|$|... "Well, {{if you had}} not hit {{him where}} you did, you would be lying on that {{stretcher}} now. It was a close thing between the two shots, not more than a fifth of a second, I should say, {{and if you had}} only hit him in the body, I have no doubt that he would have fired before he fell; and if ever a man meant to kill another, he did. I could see it in his eye, as he stood there waiting for the signal. Well, Wyatt, you can stop in the army <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> be a general, but one thing is morally certain, that after this affair no one will venture to insult you, and your first duel is likely to be your last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true, sir," [...] {{replied the}} Princess.

Dugout canoes are seen along the river from Wabo downstream, however population is sparse <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> closer <b>to</b> the coast where {{there are a few}} more villages.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was nothing}} very {{unpleasant}} about it, Ralph. I {{had plenty to}} do and to think about, and the time passed {{a great deal more}} rapidly than it would have done if I had been staying at home all by myself. It would have been very lonely and dull then; and I can assure you that I considered it no hardship at all being at the Hall. But you must not interrupt me in my story.

I really want to be perfectly fair, and so you must not stop altogether from looking at things until I am able to go with you. I think good things to look at by yourself would be stables and barnyards, and the lower part of barns. Please do not go into haylofts, nor into the chicken-yard, if there is one. You might keep your eyes on the ground <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> these places and then look up. If there are horses and cows, don't tell me anything about them when you see me. Don't tell me anything. I think I shall be well to-morrow, perhaps to-night. Miriam." ...|$|E
60|$|People {{are ordered}} to drink this water very carefully. It {{must be done}} at regular times, {{beginning}} with a little, and taking more and more each day <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> a full tumbler, and then if {{it seems to be}} too strong for you, you must take less. So far as I can find out there is nothing particular about it, except that it is lukewarm water, neither hot enough nor cold enough to make it a pleasant drink. It didn't seem to agree with Jone at first, but after he kept at it three or four days it began to suit him better, so that he could take nearly a tumbler without feeling badly. Two or three times I felt it might be better for my health if I didn't drink it, but I wanted to stand by Jone as much as I could, and so I kept on.|$|E
