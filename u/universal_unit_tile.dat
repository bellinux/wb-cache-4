A person can take a problem such as [...] and begin with a group of six <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> and then take three away to leave you with three left over, so then [...] Algebra tiles {{can also be}} used to solve problems like [...]get if you had the problem [...] Being able to relate these two problems and why they get the same answer is important because it shows that [...] Another way in which algebra tiles can be used for integer subtraction can be seen through looking at problems where you subtract a positive integer from a smaller positive integer, like [...] Here you would begin with five positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> and then you would add zero pairs to the five positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> until there were eight positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> in front of you. Adding the zero pairs will not change the value of the original five positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> you originally had. You would then remove the eight positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> and count the number of negative <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> left. This number of negative <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> would then be your answer, which would be -3.|$|R
50|$|Multiplication of {{integers}} with algebra tiles {{is performed}} through forming a rectangle with the tiles. The length and width of your rectangle {{would be your}} two factors and then {{the total number of}} tiles in the rectangle would be the answer to your multiplication problem. For instance in order to determine 3×4 you would take three positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> to represent three rows in the rectangle and then there would be four positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> to represent the columns in the rectangle. This would lead to having a rectangle with four columns of three positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles,</b> which represents 3×4. Now you can count the number of <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> in the rectangle, which will equal 12.|$|R
5000|$|Manipulating algebra tiles {{can help}} {{students}} solve linear equations. In order {{to solve a problem}} like [...] you would first place one x tile and six negative <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> in one group and then two positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> in another. You would then want to isolate the x tile by adding six positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> to each group, since whatever you do to one side has to be done to the other or they would not be equal anymore. This would create six zero pairs in the group with the x tile and then there would be eight positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> in the other group. this would mean that [...] You can also use the subtraction property of equality to solve your linear equation with algebra tiles. If you have the equation , then you can add seven negative <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> to both sides and create zero pairs, which is the same as subtracting seven.

5000|$|In {{order to}} factor using algebra tiles {{you start out}} with a set of tiles that you combine into a rectangle, this may require the use of adding zero pairs {{in order to make the}} {{rectangular}} shape. An example would be where you are given one positive x2 tile, three positive x tiles, and two positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles.</b> You form the rectangle by having the x2 tile in the upper right corner, then you have two x tiles on the right side of the x2 tile, one x tile underneath the x2 <b>tile,</b> and two <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> are in the bottom right corner. By placing the algebra tiles to the sides of this rectangle we can determine that we need one positive x tile and one positive <b>unit</b> <b>tile</b> for the length and then one positive x tile and two positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> for the width. This means that the two factors are [...] and [...] [...] In a sense this is the reverse of the procedure for multiplying polynomials.|$|R
5000|$|The {{process of}} {{completing}} the square {{can be accomplished}} using algebra tiles by placing your x2 tiles and x tiles into a square. You {{will not be able}} to completely create the square because there will be a smaller square missing from your larger square that you made from the tiles you were given, which will be filled in by the <b>unit</b> <b>tiles.</b> In order to complete the square you would determine how many <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> would be needed to fill in the missing square. In order to complete the square of x2+6x you start off with one positive x2 tile and six positive x tiles. You place the x2 tile in the upper left corner and then you place three positive x tiles to the right of the x2 tile and three positive <b>unit</b> x <b>tiles</b> under the x2 tile. In order to fill in the square we need nine positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles.</b> we have now created x2+6x+9, which can be factored into [...]|$|R
5000|$|Modeling {{algebraic}} expressions with algebra tiles is {{very similar}} to modeling addition and subtraction of integers using algebra tiles. In an expression such as [...] you would group five positive x tiles together and then three negative <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> together to represent this algebraic expression. Along with modeling these expressions, algebra tiles {{can also be used to}} simplify algebraic expressions. For instance, if you have [...] you can combine the positive and negative x <b>tiles</b> and <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> to form zero pairs to leave you with the expression [...] Since the tiles are laid out right in front of you it is easy to combine the like terms, or the terms that represent the same type of tile.|$|R
5000|$|Multiplication of binomials {{is similar}} to {{multiplication}} of monomials when using the algebra tiles [...] Multiplication of binomials can also {{be thought of as}} creating a rectangle where the factors are the length and width. As with the monomials, you set up the sides of the rectangle to be the factors and then you fill in the rectangle with the algebra tiles. This method of using algebra tiles to multiply polynomials is known as the area model and it can also be applied to multiplying monomials and binomials with each other. An example of multiplying binomials is (2x+1)×(x+2) and the first step you would take is set up two positive x tiles and one positive <b>unit</b> <b>tile</b> to represent the length of a rectangle and then you would take one positive x tile and two positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> to represent the width. These two lines of tiles would create a space that looks like a rectangle which can be filled in with certain tiles. In the case of this example the rectangle would be composed of two positive x2 tiles, five positive x tiles, and two positive <b>unit</b> <b>tiles.</b> So the solution is 2x2+5x+2.|$|R

40|$|Keyword: {{computational}} complexity, NP-completeness, Tetravex. Tetravex is {{a widely}} played one person computer game in which you are given n 2 <b>unit</b> <b>tiles,</b> each edge of which is labelled with a number. The objective is to place each tile within a n by n square such that all neighbouring edges are labelled with an identical number. Unfortunately, playing Tetravex is computationally hard. More precisely, we prove that deciding {{if there is a}} tiling of the Tetravex board given n 2 <b>unit</b> <b>tiles</b> is NP-complete. Deciding where to place the tiles is therefore NP-hard. This may help to explain why Tetravex is a good puzzle. This result compliments a number of similar results for one person games involving tiling. For example, NP-completeness results have been show for: the offline version of Tetris [DHLN 03], KPlumber (which involves rotating tiles containing drawings of pipes to make a connected network) [KMS + 04], and shortest sliding puzzle problems [RW 90]. It raises a number of open questions. For example, is the infinite version Turing-complete? How do we generate Tetravex problems which are truly puzzling as random NP-complete problem...|$|R
50|$|The algebra tiles {{are made}} up of small squares, large squares, and rectangles. The number one is {{represented}} by the small square, which is also known as the <b>unit</b> <b>tile.</b> The rectangle represents the variable x and the large square represents x2. The length of the side of the large square is equal to the length of the rectangle, also known as the x tile. When visualizing these tiles {{it is important to remember}} that the area of a square is s2, which is the length of the sides squared. So if the length of the sides of the large square is x then it is understandable that the large square represents x2. The width of the x tile is the same length as the side length of the <b>unit</b> <b>tile.</b> The reason that the algebra tiles are made this way will become clear through understanding their use in factoring and multiplying polynomials. Additionally, to reinforce the fact that x is a variable and not a fixed number, the side length of the x tile is often not an integer multiple of that of the 1 tile (for instance, it may be between 5 and 6 times its length).|$|R
