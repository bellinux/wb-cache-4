Due to the structural similarities between polyphenolic compounds and organic <b>UV</b> <b>filters,</b> they might exert photoprotection activity. The objective of the present research work was to develop bioactive sunscreen delivery systems containing rutin, Passiflora incarnata L. and Plantago lanceolata extracts associated or not with organic and inorganic <b>UV</b> <b>filters.</b> <b>UV</b> transmission of the sunscreen delivery system films was performed by using diffuse transmittance measurements coupling to an integrating sphere. In vitro photoprotection efficacy was evaluated according to the following parameters: estimated sun protection factor (SPF); Boot`s Star Rating category; UVA/UVB ratio; and critical wavelength (lambda(c)). Sunscreen delivery systems obtained SPF values ranging from 0. 972 +/- 0. 004 to 28. 064 +/- 2. 429 and bioactive compounds interacted with the <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> positive and negatively. This behavior may be attributed to: the composition of the delivery system: the presence of inorganic <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> and quantitative composition of the organic UV filters; and the phytochemical composition of the P. incarnate L and P. lanceolato extracts. Among all associations of bioactive compounds and <b>UV</b> <b>filters,</b> we found that the broad spectrum sunscreen was accomplished when 1. 68 % (w/w) P incarnata L. dry extract was in the presence of 7. 0 % (w/w) ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, 2. 0 % (w/w) benzophenone- 3 and 2. 0 % (w/w) TiO(2). It was demonstrated that this association generated estimated SPF of 20. 072 +/- 0. 906 and it has improved the protective defense against UVA radiation accompanying augmentation of the UVA/UVB ratio from 0. 49 to 0. 52 and lambda(c) from 364 to 368. 6 nm.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{determine}} {{the levels of}} free <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> and selected amino acids in cataract lenses compared with normal lenses. METHODS. Indian cataract lenses (n = 39) and normal lenses (n = 6) were examined by HPLC to quantify levels of <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> compounds, the <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> precursor amino acid tryptophan (Trp), as well as tyrosine (Tyr) and uric acid. RESULTS. The levels {{of the two major}} primate <b>UV</b> <b>filters,</b> 3 -hydroxykynurenine glucoside (3 OHKG) and 4 -(2 -amino- 3 -hydroxyphenyl) - 4 -oxobutanoic acid glucoside (AHBG), in cataract lenses were markedly decreased compared with levels in normal lenses. By contrast, the levels of Trp were greatly increased. Mean Trp concentrations were an order of magnitude higher than in normal lenses, with 86 % of dark-colored cataract lens nuclei having Trp concentrations greater than the mean level in the normal lenses. The concentrations of Tyr were also higher in cataract lenses. The levels of Kyn, however, were unchanged, and the uric acid levels were substantially lower. CONCLUSIONS. The levels of the free <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> compounds 3 OHKG and AHBG, and also of Trp, Tyr, and uric acid were different in cataract lenses compared to normal lenses. These data suggest that the metabolism of a large proportion of patients with cataract may be substantially different than in persons with normal lenses. Although the mechanism of such metabolic defects are unknown, the authors speculate that an amino acid transporter system may be upregulated in patients with cataract. Because kynurenine levels in cataract were not significantly different from those of normal lenses, there may be a defect in the lenticular <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> pathway at one, or both, of the steps that convert kynurenine to 3 OHKG. 8 page(s...|$|R

The developed method was validated and applied to the analysis of the selected compounds in river water (RW), groundwater (GW), influent and effluent wastewater (IWW and EWW). Comparing with the off-line methodologies published so far the presented method provides several advantages including a shorter extraction time, lower sample volume and minimum manipulation. Low limits of detection were achieved for all the studied matrices, < 3. ng/L (GW), < 3. 5. ng/L (RW), < 4. ng/L (EWW) and < 10. ng/L (IWW), allowing a reliable and accurate quantification of the analytes at trace level. SPE optimization and critical aspects associated with the trace level determination of the target compounds (. e. g. matrix effects) have been also considered and discussed. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of the UV F in five real water samples of each considered matrix, being the first time that these compounds were determined in GW. © 2013 Elsevier B.

Results: Average age of the subjects was 38. 5 ± 12. 2 years (range 19 - 68) and 39. 7 % were male. Sixty-two percent of eyes had some conjunctival damage as indicated by UV autofluorescence. The average area of damage was higher (p= 0. 005) nasally (2. 95 ± 4. 52 mm 2) than temporally (2. 19 ± 4. 17 mm 2). The area of UV damage was not related to age (r= 0. 03, p= 0. 674), gender (p= 0. 194), self-reported sun exposure lifestyle (p> 0. 05), geographical location (p= 0174), sunglasses use (p> 0. 05) or UV-blocking contact lens use (p> 0. 05), although it was higher in those wearing contact lenses with minimal UV-blocking and no spectacles (p= 0. 015). The area of UV damage was also less nasally in those who wore contact lenses and spectacles compared to those with no refractive correction use (p= 0. 011 nasal; p= 0. 958 temporal). Conclusion: UV conjunctival damage is common even in Europe, Kuwait and UAE, and among ECPs. The area of damage appears to be linked with the use of refractive correction, with greater damage nasally than temporally which may be explained by the peripheral light focusing effect...|$|R

In the presence of NAD(P) H, the double bond of the UV filter-derived deamination compounds, were reduced.

Purpose: The lenses of humans contain {{a group of}} small protective molecules that are known as <b>UV</b> <b>filters.</b> The main <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> present in human lenses are 3 -hydroxykynurenine O-β-D-glucoside (3 OHKG), kynurenine (Kyn), 3 -hydroxykynurenine (3 OHK) and 4 -(2 -amino- 3 -hydroxyphenyl) - 4 -oxobutanoic acid-O-β-D-glucoside (AHBG). These <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> protect the lens from UV damage and {{it is believed that}} there may be other novel related species present in the lens that act analogously. The <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> are also implicated in the progressive modification of lens proteins that occur with aging, and the development of age related nuclear cataract in older humans. The first aim of this thesis was to detect, quantify and elucidate the structures of novel 3 -hydroxykynurenine glucoside-derived <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> metabolites present in the human lens. The second aim of this thesis was to investigate bovine lens proteins modified through covalent binding with <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> and determine if these modified <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> metabolites could be photosensitisers of oxidative damage. The final aim was to describe the detection and identification of amino acid residues involved in the covalent binding of human lens <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> and metabolites to bovine lens proteins. Methods: Three novel <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> compounds 4 -(2 -amino- 3 -hydroxyphenyl) - 2 -hydroxy- 4 -oxobutanoic acid O-β-D-glucoside (3 OHKG-W), 3 -hydroxykynurenine O-β-Dglucosideyellow (3 OHKG-Y) and 2 -amino- 3 -hydroxyacetophenone O-β-D-glucoside (AHAG), along with Kyn, 3 OHK, AHBG and 3 OHKG, were detected and quantified by LC-MS/MS in 24 human lenses of different ages, of which 22 were normal and two had age related nuclear cataract. The structures of these compounds were confirmed through total synthesis and spectral analysis. The synthesised analogues (3 OHKG-Y, 3 OHKG-W, AHAG), together with a previously identified analogue (3 OHKG-D) and the major <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> (3 OHKG, Kyn, 3 OHK), were incubated with bovine lens proteins (BLP) at pH 7. 4, to mimic physiological conditions, and at pH 9. 5 (which accelerates deamination and encourages binding to protein residues). The modified lens proteins were exposed to UV light under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and in the presence and absence of free <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> for varying periods of time. The UV light irradiated BLP were then separated through SDS-PAGE to observe protein binding, aggregation and any other observable changes. Finally, the amino acid adducts produced from this incubation were identified by spectral analysis and identities confirmed by total synthesis. Their concentrations in the modified proteins were then quantified following enzymatic hydrolysis of the modified lens proteins with Pronase. Results: As reported in previous studies, 3 OHKG concentrations decreased with age in the lens nuclei, whereas the levels of three novel species, 3 OHKG-Y, 3 OHKG-W and AHAG increased, though to different extents. The deaminated metabolite of 3 OHKG (3 OHKG-D) was also detected, though in very low concentrations, and only in some of the lenses. In contrast, the concentrations of all the <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> measured present in the cortex of the lens remained constant with age. Upon irradiation of the modified BLP, different changes were observed between bound <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> having both an o-aminophenol and α,β-unsaturatedcarbonyl moieties (3 OHK) and those with only an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety (3 OHKG, Kyn, 3 OHKG-D). Metabolites with only an o-aminophenol (AHB) or without an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety (3 OHKG-Y, 3 OHKG-W or AHAG) no did not experience any visible changes. Evidence of cross-linking and nondisulphide binding was observed in the BLP modified with Kyn, 3 OHK, 3 OHKG and 3 OHKG-D. Irradiation (of at least 120 min) resulted in a significant loss of soluble protein, suggesting aggregation of modified BLP, with the greatest extent of aggregation detected with samples modified at pH 9. 5. There was evidence of <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> binding to BLP under both physiologica land basic conditions. The major lens <b>UV</b> <b>filter,</b> 3 OHKG, was found to react with lens proteins at cysteine and histidine residues, with the greatest level of binding on Cys at pH 9. 5. Low levels of binding were detected at the Lys residues at pH 9. 5. These were also observed at pH 7. 4, however, only at close to the detection limit. Comparative studies with Kyn and 3 OHK similarly resulted in lens proteins modified at Cys residues. The extent of modification was found to be significantly higher at pH 9. 5 in all cases. LC-MS/MS analysis of tryptic digests showed modifications at both α- and β-, but not γ-crystallins. By contrast, <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> compounds that cannot form α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds (i. e. cannot deaminate) did not produce covalent modification of lens proteins via side-chain interaction. 3 OHKG, Kyn and 3 OHK modified lens proteins were found to be coloured and fluorescent, resembling those from aged and age related nuclear cataractous lenses. There was also strong evidence that the structure of the protein in itself inhibits binding to internally (protected) Cys residues. Conclusion: Three novel 3 OHKG derived metabolites have been detected in extracts from normal and cataractous human lenses. In the subsequent binding studies of these metabolites (and other <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> compounds), it was confirmed that binding can only occur between BLP and a <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moieties. Covalent binding is a prerequisite to photo-oxidative damage occurring upon irradiation with UV light. No evidence of binding or protein damage was observed in samples treated with AHB, 3 OHKG-Y, 3 OHKG-W or AHAG upon UV irradiation compared to irradiated untreated BLP. Even though AHB could covalently bind to proteins via auto-oxidation of the o-aminophenol, this was not observed in this study even though AHB displayed evidence of non-covalent binding (at pH 9. 5 only). Protein modification/treatment was also examined with the <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> metabolites 3 OHKG-W and AHAG, however no modified amino acid residues were observed. There was a very low level of modification with 3 OHKG-Y, of similar proportions in both pHs, suggesting some level of spontaneous binding. This generally suggests that, other than 3 OHKG-D, 3 OHKG derived metabolites are relatively stable and unlikely to react with lens proteins.

The present study focuses on the analysis of widely used <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> 3 -(4 -methylbenzylidene) camphor (4 -MBC), octyl-methoxycinnamate (OMC), octocrylene (OC) and octyl-triazone (OT) in sewage sludge originating from a monitoring network in Switzerland. Mean concentrations in stabilised sludge from 14 wastewater treatment plants were 1780, 110, 4840 and 5510 μg/kg dry matter for 4 -MBC, OMC, OC and OT, respectively. Specific loads in sewage sludge show that <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> originate mainly from private households, but surface runoff and industries may be considered as additional sources. This indicates that besides use for sunscreens and cosmetics <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> might occur in plastics and other materials and be released to the environment by volatilization or leaching. Differences between the modeled per capita loads of <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> in sewage sludge and the observed specific loads in sewage sludge are probably due to erroneous figures of production volumes, degradation and sorption during wastewater treatment as well as degradation processes during transport in the sewer or sludge treatment. Thus, {{further research is needed}} to elucidate the fate of <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> after application and release into the environment.

40|$|The {{pertinent}} lack of {{a standard}} calibration procedure for <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> radiometers introduces unknown and potentially large uncertainties in their measurement products. Although most UV calibration facilities take into account many instrument properties that affect the measurement quality of <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> radiometers, some instrument characteristics {{that are difficult to}} determine present substantial problems, which limit the measurement quality during long term use of the instruments. At the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission a <b>UV</b> broad band <b>filter</b> radiometer reference group is under development which is intended to maintain an accurate UV irradiance scale for instruments used in <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> radiometer networks throughout Europe. The reference group is intended to be composed of instruments from institutions who may benefit from a uniform and well maintained UV irradiance scale that will be traceable to the high class UV spectroradiometer standard established at the European Reference Centre for Ultraviolet Radiation Measurements (ECUV) at the JRC. From July 2003 on, several <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> radiometers have been operating routinely next to the UV spectroradiometer standard. All <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> radiometers together will form part of the reference group, which will be calibrated according to a common procedure. A subset of 3 units in a component summation measurement configuration has been used for a closure study that allows to define a measurement accuracy for <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> radiometers. The presentation 7. 4 gives an introduction to the proposed European <b>UV</b> broad band <b>filter</b> radiometer reference SCALE (EUVSCALE) project, shows first results obtained from the measurements at ECUV, and contains a short discussion of recommendations for <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> radiometer measurements. ...|$|R
