25|$|The lizards' {{communication}} is somewhat {{similar to their}} human counterparts. Like Nancy, Sarah is more open to the humans and more interested in their world. She is also emotional, and when Charlie asks her a question that is {{hard for her to}} <b>understand</b> (<b>what</b> <b>she</b> would do if Leslie disappeared), she becomes distraught, leading to a confrontation. Leslie shares Charlie's attitude; he does not trust the humans and regards most everything they say with skepticism. Despite these problems, {{at the end of the}} play, some measure of trust is reached between all of them. Leslie decides that he and Sarah will stay on land when Nancy and Charlie, albeit reluctantly, offer to help them.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Lucky Day" [...] was {{directed}} by Stephen Agnes; it was filmed in New York City, on the East Village. During {{the production of the}} music video, they were not allowed to play music on the streets and so Roberts had to wear an ear piece with the track playing, of which she stated people were staring at as she was jumping around on the set with no music playing so people did not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing. Roberts expressed her discomfort with the shoot due to the weather saying; ...|$|E
500|$|Angel is {{the student}} council {{president}} at the afterlife school. This places her {{at odds with the}} SSS as her responsibilities require her to suppress delinquency and other disruptive activities that the team does. The SSS initially calls her [...] "Angel" [...] since they do not know her real name, but they still refer to her by it even after finding out her real name to be Kanade Tachibana. It is difficult to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is thinking due to her rarely showing any outward emotions and her way of talking bluntly. She is personally dedicated to helping others overcome their regrets and pass on. However, she often lacks a proper understanding of others, as she never thinks to try to explain to the SSS why she was doing what she did. She enjoys eating mapo doufu, a spicy dish.|$|E
60|$|Before Toby fully {{realized}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was about, almost {{before he had}} <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said, she had {{put her arms around}} his neck and given him a good sound kiss right on his freckled face.|$|R
6000|$|Lucy {{looked up}} {{with a smile and}} blush, and Foster <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant when she answered: [...] "I hope you will always be his friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rollo <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said, {{but he did}} {{not think}} it prudent to attempt to reply in the same language; so he said simply, in English,-- ...|$|R
2500|$|Bernhardt's friends {{could not}} <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw in him. Her contemporaries were puzzled by her {{decision}} to discard professional actors so as to perform next to a rank amateur. Bernhardt {{seems to have been}} blinded by emotion: Damala has been described as exceptionally untalented, lacking any acting qualifications, technique, or timing, and possessing an unintelligible Greek accent. Bernhardt was oblivious of all these shortcomings, and on the basis of her attraction for him, considered him appropriate and cast him as Armand Duval in La Dame aux Camélias (The Lady with the Camelias). Bernhardt is cited as telling a (rather shocked) Alexandre Dumas about Damala: [...] "Won't he make an excellent Armand? Only by looking at him, you understand why Marguerite Gautier dies in the way she does!".|$|E
2500|$|Franck {{was well}} known for her documentary-style {{photographs}} of important cultural figures such as painter Marc Chagall, philosopher Michel Foucault and poet Seamus Heaney, and of remote or marginalized communities such as Tibetan Buddhist monks, elderly French people, and isolated Gaelic speakers. Michael Pritchard, the Director-General of the Royal Photographic Society, observed: [...] "Martine was {{able to work with}} her subjects and bring out their emotions and record their expressions on film, helping the viewer <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had seen in person. Her images were always empathetic with her subject." [...] In 1976, Frank took one of her most iconic photos of bathers beside a pool in Le Brusc, Provence. By her account, she saw them from a distance and rushed to photograph the moment, all the while changing the roll of film in her camera. She quickly closed the lens just at the right moment, when happened to be most intense.|$|E
2500|$|Barbara Jane is {{determined}} to make it work, so she attends B.E.A.T. {{in an effort to}} [...] "get it." [...] At the end of the training session, she is worn out from Bismark's [...] "sadistic abuse, pious drivel and sheer double talk." [...] Barbara Jane also feels guilty that she did not [...] "get it." [...] Shake is insistent that the training has had proven results for him, noting that he has not dropped a football pass since completing B.E.A.T. [...] Billy Clyde also has feelings for Barbara Jane and enrolls in B.E.A.T. in order to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is going through. [...] In the training, Billy Clyde is shown coping with the seminar rules forbidding going to the bathroom. [...] For a time Puckett pretends he underwent a conversion to Bismark's way of thinking. [...] While Barbara Jane and Shake are at the altar about to be married, the minister turns to Bismark and gives him some advice on how he can avoid capital gains tax in his business. [...] Billy Clyde ends up exposing the movement's shallow side, and rescues Barbara Jane from both B.E.A.T. and her impending marriage to Shake. [...] After leaving the wedding together, Barbara Jane and Billy Clyde reveal their feelings for each other.|$|E

60|$|Very {{likely the}} wolf, who was cunning and clever, may have <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said, {{but he thought}} it best to give no sign, and {{suffered}} the skin to be sewn upon him.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Hastings {{glanced at}} Agatha, who <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant, for Sproatly had {{hitherto}} spoken of Winifred circumspectly as Miss Rawlinson. Hastings, however, took the papers which Agatha handed him, and laid them aside.|$|R
2500|$|Rabbi Tanhuma {{taught that}} Moses prostrated himself before the Israelites {{and said to}} them the words of [...] "You are to pass over the Jordan," [...] noting that he would not. Moses gave the Israelites the {{opportunity}} to pray for him, but they did not. The Midrash compared this to a king who had many children by a noble lady. The lady was undutiful {{to him and he}} decided to divorce her. He told her {{that he was going to}} marry another wife. She asked who, and he told her. She summoned her children and told them that their father intended to divorce her and marry the other woman, and asked the children if they could bear being subjected to her. She thought that perhaps they would <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant and would intercede with their father on her behalf, but they did not understand. As they did not understand, she commanded them only for their own sake to be mindful of the honor of their father. So it was with Moses. When God told him in [...] "You shall not go over this Jordan," [...] Moses spoke to the Israelites and stressed the words in [...] "You are to pass over." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{she spoke}} so low, that neither her father nor Conachar could <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said.|$|E
60|$|He {{was at a}} loss to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant; and by expressing as much in his looks, {{elicited}} her explanation.|$|E
6000|$|Brooke, {{who felt}} the girl's eyes upon him, and <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant, {{made a little}} gesture. [...] "I don't know. I shall {{probably}} take the trail again. It does not matter greatly where it may lead me." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{meant by}} {{conscientious}} mothers; {{she would have}} said conscientious whores, {{but she was not}} willing to disoblige me, for really in this case I was not a whore, because legally married, the force of former marriage excepted.|$|R
50|$|The {{trial judge}} {{dismissed}} the action with costs, holding in effect that Mr Stuart exerted no undue influence over his wife, that <b>she</b> perfectly <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{was doing and}} acted on her own uncontrolled judgment, and that no unfair advantage was taken of her.|$|R
60|$|He was {{completely}} {{at a loss}} to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant, and he said so plainly. Instead of explaining herself, she put a question.|$|E
60|$|Miss Essie cooed at {{him once}} more, and Joe winked and blinked, trying most earnestly to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said; but all to no purpose.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{she told}} me-- You can't <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> told me. She's been {{away with this}} young fellow once, and she said as much as that she'd go again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should {{much prefer}} that she should, for then I {{could get up}} on my legs and answer her off the reel." [...] Of course {{everybody}} there <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant,--including old John Bates, who stood at the sideboard and coolly drank the toast himself.|$|R
6000|$|One <b>understands</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> means, but {{she should}} have been able to say <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant--at any time before she {{discovered}} Christian Science and forgot everything she knew--and after it, too. If she had put [...] "feeble" [...] in front of [...] "efforts" [...] and then left out [...] "in" [...] and [...] "diction," [...] she would have scored.|$|R
6000|$|She wouldn't, however, have this. [...] "Nothing for {{you will}} ever {{come to the same}} thing as {{anything}} else." [...] And <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant, it seemed, sufficiently to go straight on. [...] "You say that if he does break he'll come in for things at home?" ...|$|R
60|$|Only {{then did}} Lane <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she,</b> with her woman's intuition, had divined--that {{they would never}} be {{together}} again. The realization gave him a pang. Bessy was his only victory.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was quite}} beyond me to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant. I took a chair, {{and sat down}} by her. 'I only know what {{you said to me}} yesterday,' I answered.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's not frills. I quite <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> means. It wouldn't {{have been}} very nice for the Davidsons to have to mix with all that rough lot in the smoking-room." ...|$|E
5000|$|Charlie expresses {{concern for}} her grandmother. She shakes off her illness but Charlie says <b>she</b> <b>understands</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> going through. Charlie apologizes {{for her mother}} and says to her grandmother, [...] "you've been so generous, I didn't want to ask for more". CeCe agrees to release the funds the next day.|$|R
50|$|Later, Chuck {{meets with}} Sarah {{in front of}} his apartment. He tells her that he <b>understands</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> sees in Cole. Chuck tells Sarah that he cannot live with her and {{continue}} to suppress his feelings. He tells her that when he removes the Intersect, he will live the life that he wants.|$|R
6000|$|All in a {{flash of}} sudden intuition he <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted, and even as the door of the boudoir was thrown violently open Armand--still on his knees, but with one hand pressed to his heart, the other {{stretched}} upwards to the ceiling in the most approved dramatic style, was loudly declaiming: ...|$|R
60|$|To express {{or even to}} <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> felt {{would have}} been {{impossible}} to Constance, so she had to content herself with feeling warm at her heart, at her mother's kind kiss.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis but {{a little}} faded flower.' Where's my Horace? Look here, I don't <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> means by stinkin' out Rattray's {{dormitory}} first. We holed in under White's, didn't we?" [...] asked McTurk, with a wrinkled brow.|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s {{the only}} way I can make my peace with Violet,” he said. “Can’t you <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is to me? She would promise nothing until I had made all {{straight}} with you—and I can’t let her go.” ...|$|E
60|$|The Chancellor bit his lip, and was silent. He evidently feared that, {{stupid as}} <b>she</b> looked, <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said this time, and {{was having a}} joke at his expense. He might have spared himself all anxiety: {{whatever}} accidental meaning her words might have, she herself never meant anything at all.|$|R
60|$|She has no bosom, poor soul--but I <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant. It {{failed to}} have any {{soothing}} effect on my feelings. I felt grieved and angry and puzzled, all in one. Miss Jillgall stood looking at me, with her hands still on the place where her bosom was supposed to be. She made my temper hotter than ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] he added, [...] "some of {{her ideas}} {{and some of}} the things she says might jar on you, but that doesn't count for very much, after all. The girl's staunch all through, and the way she has stuck to Winthrop in his trouble and the way she has run the farm would compel the respect of any one who <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has had to put up with." ...|$|R
