5|$|El Toro {{has several}} {{similarities}} to Viper, the coaster that it replaced. The most obvious similarity is that El Toro uses Viper's station, {{the only part}} of Viper that was not torn down. The station previously held two Viper trains at once, with a loading platform in the front and an <b>unloading</b> <b>platform</b> in the rear. The ramp that was previously Viper's main exit is now used only for wheelchair access, as El Toro has a new exit {{on the other side of}} the station. During El Toro's construction, the station was gutted and an entirely new platform built. Like El Toro, Viper turned left out of the station before the lift hill and turned left at the top of the lift before the first drop.|$|E

5|$|Each {{battery-powered}} vehicle, or AGV, {{is made up}} of two platforms. Riders sit on {{the upper}} platform, which provides three degrees of freedom. A lower platform provides omnidirectional lateral movement. Unlike previous ride designs, the trackless system and the wheel and motor configurations allow movements diagonal to a rider's perspective. The vehicles use a dead reckoning system developed by Frog AGV to navigate their way through the environment, allowing a vehicle to cross another's path. Each vehicle features a built-in controller, which wirelessly communicates with a central ride-system controller. Movement commands are issued by the ride-system controller, and executed by the vehicles' controllers. A specially-designed battery and charge system allow the vehicles to be quickly charged while docked at the loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>platforms.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Since the ride's {{opening in}} 1994, Bermuda Triangle had several {{features}} removed. Bermuda Triangle originally featured a revolving load and <b>unload</b> <b>platform</b> which increased the ride's capacity. This was decommissioned in 2005 due to safety concerns. In 2008, the gas pipeline which allowed the main volcano to spit out fireballs was removed rendering the volcano dormant. Later, the pre-show was decommissioned and special effects were broken and never fixed.On 18 October 2010, the Bermuda Triangle closed for routine maintenance until 30 November 2010. In late November, Sea World dropped the reopening date and has instead stated: [...] "Bermuda Triangle is presently closed while {{we continue to}} develop new and exciting attractions at Sea World". In early December 2010, the maintenance page was changed {{for a third time}} to read [...] "Bermuda Triangle is temporarily closed". A few days later, Sea World stated on their Facebook page that the [...] "Bermuda Triangle ride has been permanently closed to make way an exciting new future attraction". After sitting dormant for close to one and a half years, Sea World applied for a permit to demolish the ride and the interior of the show building. Once the permit was granted, demolition began in August 2012.|$|R

Platform 3 is completely dedicated to up trains(New Delhi/Patna/Jhajha/jasidih/amritsar/Barauni/Raxaul bound trains). The platforms are connected by an over-bridge covered on either sides to ensure security of the passengers. Beyond platform no. 3 there is a raised platform for loading and <b>unloading</b> goods.

40|$|Kinetics during stair {{ambulation}} {{is currently}} studied via either {{the use of}} sensing elements embedded in {{the steps of the}} stairway or simple rigid blocks of different height positioned on top of existing force platforms, typically embedded in a walkway for gait analysis. Neither of these approaches is truly satisfactory for gait analysis laboratories. The first one is expensive and requires setting up a dedicated space. The second approach is limited by the number of platforms utilized in the laboratory for evaluating level walking. This communication proposes a novel design, referred to as “interlaced stairway”, that allows one to measure ground reaction force and position of the center of pressure (CoP) for four foot contacts during stair ambulation using only two force platforms embedded in a walkway. Accuracy and precision of the CoP estimates and natural frequency of the stairway structure were derived from experimental data. Test results indicate that the interlaced stairway structure does not appreciably reduce the quality of the measures gathered by the existing force platforms. Specifically, the estimated CoP coordinates show good agreement with the horizontal coordinates of the geometric center of the calibration object utilized to assess accuracy and precision of the CoP estimates (max difference< 6 mm). The natural frequency of the stairway structure is lower than the one for the <b>unloaded</b> force <b>platform</b> but higher than the frequency components of interest in stair ambulation analysis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{special wagon}} {{with a low}} {{rotatable}} loading platform for transportation of truck vehicles by rail was developed in Military University of Technology in the Department of Mechanics and Applied Computer Science in Warsaw. The essence of such reloading is to place the semitrailer on a special rotatable platform {{with the use of}} a truck tractor. The structure can be used for transportation of different types of vehicles such as tractors, trucks, trailers, semitrailers and cargo containers. The wagon allows quick and fast loading and <b>unloading</b> without any <b>platform</b> infrastructure or terminals. An intermodal transport system based on an innovative concept of the railway wagon, which will use the national railway infrastructure, was developed. The process of loading and unloading the trailers can be performed considering a whole train or individual wagons from any part of the train (no cranes needed). This type of railway wagon will allow transport companies to save time and money for road transport. The advantages of this construction are reduction of the negative impact on the environment as well as an increase of road safety by reducing the number of vehicles on the roads. As part of the work on the wagon and the intermodal transport system, a strength test of the wagon structure was carried out and the effort of the basic components of a the wagon and a complete structure was estimated. For this purpose, numerical analysis was used...|$|R

50|$|The station opened {{as part of}} {{the line}} opening on 10 May 1982. A {{commemorative}} plaque in the station concourse, near exit A, was unveiled by Acting Governor Sir Philip Haddon-Cave. The station was designed as an intermediate station with two side platforms, with trains terminating at Tsuen Wan West, further northwest near Tsuen King Garden, different from the present West Rail Line Tsuen Wan West Station. The area around the proposed terminus had a poor development record and it was decided to not build a station there, even though tracks had already been laid. This explains why the station uses different platforms for loading and unloading. After leaving the <b>unloading</b> <b>platform,</b> trains enter the section of track beyond the station to proceed to the Tsuen Wan Depot or reverse back to the loading platform to go towards Central.|$|E
