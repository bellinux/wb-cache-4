5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>in</b> {{the value of the}} Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>in</b> the mass of a 12C atom—and the magnitude of the kilogram—could be no better than the current 50ppb <b>uncertainty</b> <b>in</b> the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements {{of the value of the}} Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83⅓ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by graphene-based quantum {{computer}} {{we examine the}} time-dependence of the position-momentum and position-velocity <b>uncertainties</b> <b>in</b> the monolayer gapped graphene.

The <b>uncertainties</b> <b>in</b> the graphene are mainly contributed by two phenomena, spreading and zitterbewegung.

40|$|Abstract. We {{use the new}} GLOMAP {{model of}} global aerosol microphysics to {{investigate}} the sensitivity of modelled sulfate and sea salt aerosol properties to <b>uncertainties</b> <b>in</b> the driving microphysical processes and compare these uncertainties with those associated with aerosol and precursor gas emissions. Overall, we conclude that <b>uncertainties</b> <b>in</b> microphysical processes have a larger effect on global sulfate and sea salt derived condensation nuclei (CN) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations than <b>uncertainties</b> <b>in</b> present-day sulfur emissions. Our simulations suggest that <b>uncertainties</b> <b>in</b> predicted sulfate and sea salt CCN abundances due to poorly constrained microphysical processes {{are likely to be}} of a similar magnitude to long-term changes in sulfate and sea salt CCN due to changes in anthropogenic emissions.

5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The <b>uncertainty</b> <b>in</b> these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra <b>uncertainty</b> <b>in</b> the value of the calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E
