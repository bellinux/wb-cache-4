2500|$|A Confederate 2nd {{national}} {{flag of the}} combined 6th & 7th Arkansas Infantry. currently in the Missouri State archives in Columbia, Missouri. When examined in 1978, it consisted of a 40 1/2" [...] x 76 1/2" [...] white bunting field with a red canton bearing an <b>unedged</b> 3 1/2" [...] wide St. Andrew's cross bearing thirteen white cotton stars, those on the arms 3 1/2" [...] across their points, the center 5" [...] across its points, applied to the reverse and cut away on the obverse (reverse side accordingly 1/2" [...] larger in diameter.) The white field bears the following inscriptions: (upper- in outline scrolls) [...] "6th and 7th/ARK/REG'T" [...] (middle) [...] "God & Our Country"; (lower) [...] "SHILOH. PERRYVILLE. MURFREESBORO.", all in red painted lettering. This flag dates no earlier than May 1863 and was probably a [...] "parade" [...] flag used briefly between May and June 1863, however no firm history survives regarding it.|$|E
60|$|Thus far {{not very}} many pennies had been given him, and, used at last to his strange looks, the less polite {{passengers}} of those {{in that part of}} the boat began to get their fill of him as a curious object; when suddenly the negro more than revived their first interest by an expedient which, whether by chance or design, was a singular temptation at once to diversion and charity, though, even more than his crippled limbs, it put him on a canine footing. In short, as in appearance he seemed a dog, so now, in a merry way, like a dog he began to be treated. Still shuffling among the crowd, now and then he would pause, throwing back his head and, opening his mouth like an elephant for tossed apples at a menagerie; when, making a space before him, people would have a bout at a strange sort of pitch-penny game, the cripple's mouth being at once target and purse, and he hailing each expertly-caught copper with a cracked bravura from his tambourine. To be the subject of alms-giving is trying, and to feel in duty bound to appear cheerfully grateful under the trial, must be still more so; but whatever his secret emotions, he swallowed them, while still retaining each copper this side the oesophagus. And nearly always he grinned, and only once or twice did he wince, which was when certain coins, tossed by more playful almoners, came inconveniently nigh to his teeth, an accident whose unwelcomeness was not <b>unedged</b> by the circumstance that the pennies thus thrown proved buttons.|$|E

50|$|Kuigo tsässon {{is built}} from rough hewn pine beams {{from the outside}} {{as well as on}} the inside. The {{building}} has an open shelter, the sides of which have an 80 cm high barrier. It is made from upright <b>unedged</b> boards and fitted by a few centimetre gaps. Fence boards are attached to long protruding wall beams. The outer measurements for the beam part of tsässon without corner cross-beams are 350 x 486 centimetres, of which the entrance-room makes up 136 cm. The entrance-room does not have a ceiling. The gables are made from boards with the edges placed on top of each other, stretching up to collar beams. Kuigo tsässon stands on granite stones. The height of the building up to the roof ridge is 350 cm. The roof has a double shingle cover and there is a simple saw timber cross on the ridge. Another wooden cross is attached to the beams above the door. There is a door made from wide boards in the front wall that opens on the inside and a window in the northern side wall with four squares (h 50 x w 40 cm).|$|E
50|$|Tsässon is {{furnished}} traditionally: {{there is}} an icon table in the rear wall covered by a white towel. Most of the icons are attached on the rear wall {{and there is a}} carved crate with a glass door (kibot) on the icon table. Icon depicting Virgin Mary is fixed on the wall and covered by a knitted woollen red-patterned icon scarf (pühaserätt). Other icons are covered by two icon scarves painted on dark fabric and one newer knitted icon scarf. There are embroidered and crocheted tea towels and a few icons on the side walls. There is a smallish metal oil lamp hanging in front of the right-hand angled icon and a candle-holder made from a gnarled tree-trunk. An analoi {{stands in the middle of}} the tsässon, a table in one wall and a long bench in the other wall. Floor is covered by rag carpets. The ceiling of the tsässon is made from <b>unedged</b> boards that are fitted with the edges placed on top of each other. The floor is made from wide planks. There is no extra finishing on the floors-ceilings and inner walls.|$|E
50|$|Obinitsa tsässon {{is built}} from pine beams which are unhewn {{from the inside}} {{as well as from}} the outside. The {{building}} has an entrance-room that is supported by poles and the main part of it is made from logs. The outer measurements of the tsässon without corner cross-beams are 347 x 560 centimetres, of which the entrance-room makes up 130 cm. The entrance-room does not have a ceiling or a gate, the fence is about a metre high and made from upright <b>unedged</b> boards and fitted in by a few centimetre gaps. The gables are made from boards with the edges placed on top of each other. Tsässon stands on granite stones. The height of the building (the part made from beams) is 194 cm and the height up to the ridge is 383 cm. The roof has a double shingle cover. The ridge has a simple round-timber juniper cross. There is no ceiling on the building and the floor is made from wide boards. There is a door made from wide boards in the front wall that opens on the inside.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 It {{has been}} {{observed}} that edging flitches into lumber unnecessarily reduces the yield of cut stock. This research investigated the yield of cut stock from <b>unedged</b> red alder (Alnus rubra) flitches, and compared it to yields attained from boards subjected {{to a variety of}} edging strategies: conventional, light-edging, actual, severe and no edging. Results showed that <b>unedged</b> lumber yielded 18...|$|E

This scanner, placed upstream to edging phases of concerned wood products (<b>unedged</b> timber, square edged timber), allows to make visible not perceptible defect of the material by the human operator eye. These new knowledge in correlation with rough materials has to allow an improvement of the valuation of the end products, but also has to indicate the improvement tracks of the production installation. Our first tries aim at validating this hypothesis...|$|E
