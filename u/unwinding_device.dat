40|$|NOVELTY - The {{conveyor}} (1) carrying cut {{plants from}} the harvesting machine incorporates a machine (2) for stringing together the plants by supplying {{at least one}} packaging tape (8) to the plants as they are transported by endless conveyor belts (3) and using this tape to form a chain (13) of strung together plants. USE - None given. ADVANTAGE - Collection and sorting of the cut plants is made less manually intensive. DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the machine.

40|$|Ionospheric {{interaction}} experiments using a conductive, fully bare tether are discussed. With {{an optimal}} design, requiring 1. 15 mm diameter and 7. 5 km full length for a collected current of 0. 87 A at day conditions, the tether radiates 0. 33 watts as Fast Magnetosonic waves and 0. 16 watts as Alfven waves. Secondary keV electrons are produced over a 6. 5 km length, giving raise to noticeable auroral {{effects in the}} D-layer, at low geomagnetic latitudes. A preliminary design of the experiment, to be implemented on either a satellite or a Station, has been carried out. An ejector gives an initial velocity to an end mass, a free spool of tether unwinding from that mass during a first stage of deployment; other phases are monitored through the tether velocity, driving a reel with an <b>unwinding</b> <b>device...</b>|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the project}} is to design new flange {{manufacturing}} technology. The flange is manufactured from stainless sheet 17 040 with 5 mm thickness and annual production batch of 800 000 pieces. Fineblanking process has been proposed as a new production technology. Technological and construction dimensions have been designed for the proposed technology. The fineblanking process is done by automated machine which consist of <b>unwinding</b> and straightening <b>device,</b> mechanical punch press and winding device. The manufactured part is punch pressed by tool which {{is located in the}} punch press in one lift. An economic evaluation compares current manufacturing technology with the proposed technology which is more economically convenient...|$|R
