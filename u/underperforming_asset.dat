40|$|Forecasts of {{continued}} {{high rates of}} population growth for Australia's major cities are placing increased pressure on metropolitan planning strategies for more innovative urban infill solutions. To slow sprawl, infill targets of 70 % or more designed to accommodate new dwelling development over the next 25 years in the established middle suburbs are falling well short of requirements. This chapter will provide a perspective on why this is not occurring and will update progress on research directed towards the framing of a new model for greyfield precinct redevelopment - akin to what was created for brownfields under the Building Better Cities Program of the early 1990 s. Greyfields constitute those predominently residential areas in Australian cities where the stock is ageing, is physically deteriorating, technologically obsolescent and environmentally poor performing and where {{the value of the}} property lies in the land - an economically <b>underperforming</b> <b>asset,</b> but occupied, unlike brownfields and greenfields. Greyfields, however are extremely well located in the established low density middle suburbs of Australian cities, with good access to public transport, jobs and higher level education and health services. They represent untapped potential for more intensive, regenerative retrofitting - at precinct scale. Unlocking this potential requires innovation in multiple arenas such as urban governance and urban planning and design - the focus for this chapter, using the city of Melbourne, Australia as the case study...|$|E

The purchase of San Antonio added $1.1 billion of healthy assets, $1.2 billion unhealthy assets, and a $1.3 billion government cash advance to Perelman's larder while Sooner only provided $1.2 billion in assets along with the typical government guarantees. [...] Sooner Federal was not only the last S Perelman bought, but the first he sold; In August 1992, he sold the pieces of Sooner to Bank of Oklahoma and Fourth Financial Corporation for $31.4 million. [...] The following month he sold the rest of First Gibraltar to BankAmerica for $110 million, retaining four branches in Plano, Texas and $1.2 billion of assets in the mortgage and property management sectors.

40|$|EVA® is a {{performance}} metric that calculates {{the creation of}} shareholder value and is a registered trademark of Stern Stuart, New York. EVA® has been widely adopted by management when making decisions to increase productivity, where to invest new capital and which <b>underperforming</b> <b>assets</b> to liquidate. EVA® is also widely used by investors and analysts {{as a measure of}} company performance when deciding on which shares to invest in. While extensive research was done on EVA® and share price performance internationally, the aim of this research was to determine whether a positive EVA® leads to growth in its share price, specifically for retail and banking shares listed on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE). The banking and retail sector was selected as both these sectors experience favourable growth in terms of turnover during decreasing interest rate periods and unfavourable growth during increasing interest rate periods. Thus EVA® was selected as one of the better performance measures to use to show true operating performance. Statistical tests were done on turnover growth rates, EVA® growth rates, EVA® and Turnover, EVA® and Share Price growth and finally EVA® and other common performance measures. Common performance measures were limited to Price/Earnings, Earnings Per Share, Return On Assets and Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation. After analysis of the results, it was found that turnover growth rates were statistically similar for the banking sector during the period 1998 to 2007, but not for the retail sector. Leading on from that it was found that share price correlates well with EVA® for the banking sector however not for the retail sector. The study also further revealed that none of the common performance measures correlated well with EVA for both the banking and retail sector.

40|$|The modern mining {{industry}} is highly mechanized and relies on massive, multimillion-dollar {{pieces of equipment}} for achieving production targets. In an increasingly challenging international economic climate, mining operations are reliant on economies of scale to remain competitive. To maximize revenue, {{it is imperative that}} at each stage of the mining process, equipment is operating optimally without preventable and unnecessary interruptions. As a result, the focus of all mining operations is to increase equipment uptime and utilization. The Aitik open pit copper mine is located approximately 15 km south-east of the town of Gällivare in Northern Sweden. It is the largest copper mine in Sweden and uses a conventional truck-shovel operation. The loading fleet at Aitik consists of several power shovels to load trucks with blasted material for transport, either to the crushers or to the waste dumps. The maintenance activities for mining shovels are critical when it comes to keeping them available for production. Hence, any attempt to achieve improvements in the maintenance function for mining shovels, is a worthwhile endeavour. The Aitik mine employs various computer-aided applications to track and maintain mobile mining equipment. These applications also serve as chronological operational and maintenance databases for the equipment. The work presented in this thesis comprises six mining shovels and is based on the analysis of three data types; historical maintenance data from CMMS Maximo, operational data from mine management system Cat® MineStar™, and event-log data from individual shovels. The data sets span over two years from March 2010 to March 2012 and, were sourced from the maintenance department at the Aitik mine. As part of this investigation, the three distinct data sets were analysed separately and further research was undertaken to integrate them. For a standalone investigation of individual data types, separate methods of analysis were required. Historical maintenance data consisted of over sixteen and a half thousand individual work orders. These were analyzed to identify shovel subsystems and components with respect to the number of associated corrective maintenance work orders. From MineStar data, maintenance key performance indicators such as availability, mean time between failures, and mean time to restore were calculated, using European standard EN 15341 : 2007. Such KPIs are useful for identifying <b>underperforming</b> <b>assets</b> within the shovel fleet, and provide a quantifiable means for benchmarking maintenance performance. Finally, frequently recurring events were identified through a Pareto analysis and were correlated with historical maintenance data. The results from this study indicate towards viable prospects for such a synthesis. A regular time-lapse integration of the diverse data types displays potential; and could prove to be helpful, for achieving overall improvements in the maintenance function. In addition, this integration could prove to be beneficial from an operational standpoint. For instance, such a data synthesis can aid {{in the development of a}} proactive and collaborative approach towards asset management. Validerat; 20121105 (anonymous...|$|R

In reality, however, investors must satisfy margin requirements which completely change {{the economics of}} arbitrage. We derive the optimal investment policy for a risk-averse investor in a market where there are arbitrage opportunities. We show that it is often optimal to underinvest in the arbitrage by taking a smaller position than margin constraints allow. In some cases, it is actually optimal for {{an investor}} {{to walk away from}} a pure arbitrage opportunity. Even when the optimal policy is followed, the arbitrage strategy may <b>underperform</b> the riskless <b>asset</b> or have an unimpressive Sharpe ratio. Furthermore, the arbitrage portfolio typically experiences losses at some point before the final convergence date.

40|$|Global marine capture {{fisheries}} are an <b>underperforming</b> global <b>asset.</b> The Sunken Billions {{study shows}} {{that the difference between}} the potential and actual net economic benefits from marine fisheries is in the order of $ 50 billion per year  equivalent to more than half the value of the global seafood trade. The cumulative economic loss to the global economy over the last three decades is estimated to be in the order of two trillion dollars. In many countries the catching operations are buoyed up by subsidies, so that the global fishery economy to the point of landing (the harvest sub-sector), is in deficit. Improved governance can recapture a substantial proportion of the of this $ 50 billion annual economic loss. With effective economic incentives, rather than being a net drain on the global economy, sustainable fisheries can create an economic surplus, be a driver of economic growth and a basis for livelihood opportunities. Economically, healthy fisheries are fundamental to achieving not only the restoration of fish stocks but other accepted objectives for the fisheries sector, such as improved livelihoods, exports, fish food security and economic growth. When fish stocks are fully exploited in the biological sense, the associated fisheries are almost invariably performing below their economic optimum. In some cases, fisheries may be biologically sustainable but still operate at an economic loss. The depletion in fish capital resulting from overexploitation is rarely reflected in the reckoning of a nation's overall capital and GDP growth. For over three decades the world's marine fish stocks have come under increasing pressure from fishing, from loss of habitats and from pollution. Rising sea temperatures and the increasing acidity of the oceans is placing further stress on already stressed ecosystems. Illegal fishing and unreported catches undermine fishery science while some subsidies continue to support unsustainable fishing practices. Marine fisheries reform can recapture a substantial proportion of the economic losses. Rather than being a net drain on the global economy, sustainable fisheries can create an economic surplus and be a driver of economic growth, both in the marine economy and other sectors. The biological sustainability of fish stocks has often occupied the centre stage of international efforts, for example, the Plan of Implementation of the WSSD makes specific reference to recovery of fish stocks. However sustainable fisheries are not only a problem of biology and ecology, but one of managing political and economic processes and replacing pernicious incentives with those which foster improved governance and responsible stewardship. The comprehensive reforms required imply political, social and economic costs. Fisheries reform is a long-term process and will require political will founded on a consensus vision built through broad stakeholder dialogue...|$|R
40|$|Uneconomical {{choices and}} <b>underperforming</b> <b>assets</b> need a rethink, argues Frank Fisher• THERE are few things humans do {{that are as}} inefficient as urban {{commuting}} in driver-only driver-owned cars, or DODOs. When potentially ten billion people seek urban commuting the way Australians do it – one car per person and 20, 000 km/yr – the planet can no longer support us. Even driving cars 300 per cent more efficient than today’s Australian car fleet, we will be three time worse off… What follows is an unconventional look at the logic of current urban commuting and how public transport could be made more attractive. The current situation: commuting by DODO Energy efficiency: Other than public transport ticketing (addressed below) there are few things as uneconomic as DODOs, which currently work at less than 1 per cent efficiency. For every 100 litre of petrol, less than one litre actually shifts the driver; 99 +litres moves the car and enables its essential infrastructure. The average engine converts petrol to motion at about 15 per cent. But we drive cars not engines and cars are roughly 15 times heavier than the average driver, so a driver-in-a-car moves at 1 % efficiency.   Cars {{take a lot of}} energy to make, deliver to drivers and maintain over their lives – some say as much as half the energy in the fuel they use in their lives! Further, it takes energy to scrap and recycle cars and a vast amount to build and maintain the infrastructures that enable cars to move where we want them to go. These are roads, government and private support organisations ranging from registration departments to taxation offices, police, insurances, breakdown clubs, hospitals, more insurances, automobile chambers of commerce and so on. So, the DODO’s real efficiency is actually much less than 1 % … but no one cares because (a) we’ve paid a lot for our cars and for putting them on the road and keeping them there, (b) virtually no one knows what efficiency means anyway and that’s partly because (c) petrol’s cheaper than bottled water and all the pollution and its consequences are invisible!Time efficiency: The craziness of this equation doesn’t end with energy efficiency. Owning our private “gutter decorations” (the DODO’s primary occupation) means that we spend many weeks of each year engaged in earning {{the money to pay for}} the privilege. Add this to the time spent in driving, parking and maintaining our DODOs, then divide that total into the number of kilometres travelled annually, and the average speed attained is much less than that achieved by a combination of bicycle and public transport. Driver efficiency: In the face of easy and relatively cheap rental/car-sharing, the economics of owning our cars is highly questionable. Further, using bicycles and public transport makes the journey to work, shopping etc, the only opportunity many people have to exercise-as-part-of-daily-routines.  Finally, as if this inefficiency were not bad enough, Americans, Brazilians and now some Europeans and Australians, compound it by feeding DODOs biofuels made from human foodstuffs such as corn and sugar. So, in addition to using less than 1 per cent of these food-based fuels to move drivers, biofuels are themselves produced inefficiently in terms of the fuels used to make them. The fuels required for farming, refining and other processes to make biofuels can actually be as much as the biofuels themselves deliver! Madness surely?Given all this, why urban citizens would bother to own their cars beats me. Once our generalised vehicles-for-all-purposes are disowned, one can easily afford to rent the appropriate vehicle for the odd task. For urban commuting, the appropriate vehicles are shoes, bicycles and public transport, these three being appropriate for our health, our city’s health, the planet’s health and the health of our public and private purses.   Ticketless public transport Even with the prospect of automated ticketing (myki in Melbourne) working “glitchlessly”, it is not hard to demonstrate that ticketing does not pay for itself, let alone make any contribution to public transport itself. Aside from the fabulous cost ($ 3 billion) of Melbourne’s myki and its predecessor, there are many hidden costs involved in having the public pay public transport fares. I list some below but draw special attention to some quite unrecognised costs that arise from the deliberate exclusion of our railways’ extensive real-estate assets from the public domain as a result of excluding the ticketless from railway stations. In addition to the costs of vandalism control and damage restitution, the site insecurity that breeds in deserted stations, especially at night, leads to reduced patronage. But the most serious losses arise from the site rents foregone by excluding commerce and community activity from nearly all metropolitan railway stations. Tickets require public transport users to be “validated” before entering the system. To viscerally impress this requirement upon passengers, we surround our stations with high fences, cutting them off from commercial and community use. Unstaffed buildings, often quite handsome, are locked and vandal-proofed. And, as if to say “no station is sacred”, the very open friendliness of pre-myki Southern Cross in Melbourne is now ruined by fences and barriers erected where never intended. Staffed stations themselves are underutilised. The associated losses are not simply directly financial, they also manifest as losses to community and personal amenity. Instead of being friendly islands of community, stations have become isolated black holes, literally avoided as such, by late-night travellers. In the absence of totally “free” public transport, an enlivening alternative to the present vacuous, destructive, fare-collection-related employment schemes, is the public transport levy, or PTL. By having an annual Medicare-like PTL collected from all urban wage-earners, we’d know we’d paid something toward our urban public transport, have that incentive to use it and then be able to climb on, free of demeaning encumbrances like barriers and ticket inspection. Indeed, where machines do the inspection, the demeaning impact is of great concern. To argue against the veracity of machines takes determination. More, our tacit permission to be tracked (financially, and more worryingly spatially) raises questions about the openness of our democracy. Here is what a PTL could provide:• public transport free at point of access with all the liberation that that would imply. • shedding some of the taxes that are currently used to pay for public transport. • free public transport for rural visitors and tourists, just like public water. Along with fast and regular rural rail, this would provide an incentive to use rural public transport to commute to the cities. • a built-in incentive for urban residents to use public transport. The annual payment would remind us that we’d paid and therefore that we may as well use what we’d paid for. • an improvement in the status of travel on our metro-systems, which would no longer be seen as the DODO’s “poor cousin”. • a dramatic decline in the deaths and injuries from crashes and the many diseases directly attributable to DODO-commuting (in Melbourne some 600 deaths annually). • a friendly, welcoming system where the stresses associated with requiring a ticket, along with the threats associated with not being able to produce one, have been removed. • removal of favours to those wealthy enough to afford congestion taxes such as city parking fees (often paid for by others) and fines, thereby avoiding the resentment such favours generate. • the usual Medicare-like support for people for whom the levy would be an excessive burden. • removal of barriers to the poor to use public transport. • the “disarming” of the public transport system with transit assistants replacing “fare police” and the return of the space and vacant buildings around platforms to commerce and the community. • a welcoming and attractive system, partly arising from the greater density of users that a ticketless system would bring. • removal of the threat to monitor citizens’ movements by tracking us through the electronic systems. • enhanced participation rates. These would provide the political constituency for dramatically improving the current carrying capacities of our metropolitan transit. Relieving rail-congestion is, especially in the long run, cheaper and healthier than relieving road-congestion. Consider the neglected costs of making good the planetary damage caused by global warming and the many other negative pollution and land degradation effects of DODO commuting. Currently these are not priced and go unpaid by present generations. • a more open and equitable system in which payment for the system was overt rather than covert as at present – where real payment for public transport comes from consolidated revenues. An annual PTL bill could indicate the proportion of the total cost of metro-transit that the levy actually covered. It must be recognised that dramatically increasing the capacity of our urban rail systems is no small feat. It will cost billions, take time and create substantial public disruption. Indeed, an argument against the PTL is precisely the government’s fear of overloading the current system. For all that, we live in a representative democracy and the government requires constituency before it acts. So overloading the system is a language it can hear. One of the most valuable implications of a PTL and a dramatic improvement in public transport availability would be the support that it would give to the effectiveness of the bicycle-rail collaboration. Long ago, Melbourne’s Alan Parker pointed out that the fastest, cheapest, healthiest and most sustainable way to get around much of the metropolitan area was a combination of bicycle and rail – that is, bicycle to and from rail. This requires improved bike parking facilities at stations and an improved capacity to carry bikes on trains. With bike-rail, our cities become “translucent”. No peak hour traffic jams, no parking problems, no need for fuel and maintenance, no depreciation on the car, no speeding fines and, most of all, two to three times faster than the DODO because there’s no time wasted earning the money to pay for it! • Frank Fisher is a professor in the Faculty of Design and the National Centre for Sustainability at Swinburne University of Technology Photo: BeardPapa/ Flick...|$|R
