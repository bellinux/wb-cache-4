40|$|Corn {{seedlings}} {{respond to}} insect herbivore-inflicted injury by releasing relatively {{large amounts of}} several characteristic terpenoids and, as a result, become highly attractive to parasitic wasps that attack the herbivores. Chemical evidence showed that the induced emission of volatiles {{is not limited to}} the sites of damage but occurs throughout the plant. This evidence was obtained by comparing the release of volatiles from leaves of unharmed (control) seedlings with the release of volatiles from <b>undamaged</b> <b>leaves</b> of seedlings with two injured leaves treated with caterpillar regurgitant. Immediately after injury no differences were measured in the released volatiles, but several hours later the <b>undamaged</b> <b>leaves</b> of injured plants released the terpenoids linalool, (3 E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 -nonatriene, and (3 E, 7 E) - 4, 8, 12 -trimethyl- 1, 3, 7, 11 -tridecatetraene in significantly larger amounts than leaves of unharmed plants. Other volatiles that are released by herbivore-injured leaves were detected occasionally only in trace amounts from the <b>undamaged</b> <b>leaves</b> of a damaged seedling. The systemic release of volatiles by injured corn coincided with attractiveness to the parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris; <b>undamaged</b> <b>leaves</b> of injured plants became significantly more attractive than leaves from control seedlings. These findings show conclusively that when a plant is injured by an insect herbivore the whole plant emits chemical signals...|$|E
40|$|In Arabidopsis, the MYC 2 {{transcription}} factor {{on the one}} hand and the AP 2 /ERF {{transcription factor}}s ORA 59 and ERF 1 on the other hand regulate distinct branches of the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway in an antagonistic fashion, co-regulated by abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene, respectively. Feeding by larvae of the specialist herbivorous insect Pieris rapae (small cabbage white butterfly) results in activation of the MYC-branch and concomitant suppression of the ERF-branch in insect-damaged leaves. Here we investigated differential JA signaling activation in undamaged systemic leaves of P. rapae-infested plants. We found that the MYC 2 transcription factor gene was induced both in the local insect-damaged leaves and the systemic <b>undamaged</b> <b>leaves</b> of P. rapae-infested Arabidopsis plants. However, in contrast to the insect-damaged leaves, the undamaged tissue did not show activation of the MYC-branch marker gene VSP 1. Comparison of the hormone signal signature revealed that the levels of JA and (+) - 7 -iso-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) raised to similar extents in locally damaged and systemically <b>undamaged</b> <b>leaves,</b> but the production of ABA and the JA precursor 12 -oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) was enhanced only in the local herbivore-damaged leaves, and not in the distal <b>undamaged</b> <b>leaves.</b> Challenge of <b>undamaged</b> <b>leaves</b> of pre-infested plants with either P. rapae larvae or exogenously applied ABA led to potentiated expression levels of MYC 2 and VSP 1, with the latter reaching extremely high expression levels. Moreover, P. rapae-induced resistance, as measured by reduction of caterpillar growth on pre-infested plants, was blocked in the ABA biosynthesis mutant aba 2 - 1, that was also impaired in P. rapae-induced expression of VSP 1. Together, these results suggest that ABA is a crucial regulator of herbivore-induced resistance by activating primed JA-regulated defense responses upon secondary herbivore attack in Arabidopsis...|$|E

The interplant signaling is largely dependent on the jasmonic acid pathway of the damaged local plants, and can be found among conspecific or heterospecific hosts of different families. Importantly, herbivore attack of one host plant elevates defensive metabolites in the other systemic Cuscuta bridge-connected hosts, resulting in enhanced resistance against insects even in several consecutively Cuscuta-connected host plants over long distances (> 100 cm). By facilitating plant-to-plant signaling, Cuscuta provides an information-based means of countering the resource-based fitness costs to their hosts...|$|R

40|$|Apectrum hyemale is a {{perennial}} forest herb of eastern North American deciduous forest. Its wintergreen phenology makes it unique among temperate forest herbs: a single striated blue-green leaf emerges in early fall, photosynthesizes through the winter, and senesces {{in the spring}} as the canopy closes. Although it is considered globally secure (G 5), this species is uncommon throughout much of its range and populations are highly fragmented.

The release of volatiles was detected from upper, <b>undamaged</b> <b>leaves</b> after 2 to 3 d of continuous larval damage on lower leaves of the same plant. Compounds released systemically were (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate, (E) -[beta]-ocimene, linalool, (E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 -nonatriene, (E) -[beta]-farnesene, (E,E) -[alpha]-farnesene, and (E,E) - 4, 8, 12 -trimethyl- 1, 3, 7, 11 -tridecatetraene.

However, when upper, <b>undamaged</b> <b>leaves</b> of a caterpillar-damaged plant were damaged with a razor blade, they released isomeric hexenyl butyrates, 2 -methylbutyrates, and large amounts of constitutive compounds in addition to the previously detected induced compounds.

This study examined herbivore-induced defenses in the nornicotine-rich African tobacco N. africana, the only Nicotiana species indigenous to Africa. We tested the predictions that: 1) N. africana will have high constitutive levels of leaf, flower and nectar alkaloids; 2) leaf herbivory by the African bollworm Helicoverpa armigera will induce increased alkaloid levels in leaves, flowers and nectar; and 3) increased alkaloid concentrations in herbivore-damaged plants will negatively affect larval growth. We grew N. africana in large pots in a greenhouse and exposed flowering plants to densities of one, three and six fourth-instar larvae of H. armigera, for four days. Leaves, flowers and nectar were analyzed for nicotine, nornicotine and anabasine. The principal leaf alkaloid was nornicotine (mean: 28 µg/g dry mass) followed by anabasine (4. 9 µg/g) and nicotine (0. 6 µg/g). Nornicotine was found in low quantities in the flowers, but no nicotine or anabasine were recorded. The nectar contained none of the alkaloids measured. Larval growth was reduced when leaves of flowering plants were exposed to six larvae. As predicted by the optimal defense theory, herbivory had a localized effect and caused an increase in nornicotine concentrations in both <b>undamaged</b> top <b>leaves</b> of herbivore damaged plants and herbivore damaged leaves exposed to one and three larvae. The nicotine concentration increased in damaged compared to <b>undamaged</b> middle <b>leaves.</b> The nornicotine concentration was lower in damaged leaves of plants exposed to six compared to three larvae, suggesting that N. africana rather invests in new growth as opposed to protecting older leaves under severe attack. The {{results indicate that the}} nornicotine-rich N. africana will be unattractive to herbivores and more so when damaged, but that potential pollinators will be unaffected because the nectar remains alkaloid-free even after herbivory...|$|R

For example, maize seedlings attacked by beet armyworm larvae (Spodoptera exigua) produce a mixture of terpenoid and indole volatiles that serve to attract parasitic wasps. A key step in terpenoid biosynthesis is the conversion of acyclic prenyl diphosphates to terpenoid compounds by specific terpenoid synthases (cyclases). We have cloned a maize sesquiterpene cyclase gene, stc 1, by transposon tagging and have identified two deletion mutations of the gene.

Analysis of volatiles from volicitin-treated seedlings revealed that a major naphthalene-based sesquiterpene was present in wild-type seedlings but absent in the Ac-insertion and x-ray-deletion mutants.

40|$|Plant defense {{responses}} to wounding and herbivore attack are regulated by signal transduction pathways that operate {{both at the}} site of wounding and in <b>undamaged</b> distal <b>leaves.</b> Genetic analysis in tomato indicates that systemin and its precursor protein, prosystemin, are upstream components of a wound-induced, intercellular signaling pathway that involves both the biosynthesis and action of jasmonic acid (JA). To examine the role of JA in systemic signaling, reciprocal grafting experiments were used to analyze wound-induced expression of the proteinase inhibitor II gene in a JA biosynthetic mutant (spr- 2) and a JA response mutant (jai- 1). The results showed that spr- 2 plants are defective in the production, but not recognition, of a graft-transmissible wound signal. Conversely, jai- 1 plants are compromised in the recognition of this signal but not its production. It was also determined that a graft-transmissible signal produced in response to ectopic expression of prosystemin in rootstocks was recognized by spr- 2 but not by jai- 1 scions. Taken together, the results show that activation of the jasmonate biosynthetic pathway in response to wounding or (pro) systemin is required for the production of a long-distance signal whose recognition in distal leaves depends on jasmonate signaling. These findings suggest that JA, or a related compound derived from the octadecanoid pathway, may act as a transmissible wound signal...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{respond to}} {{herbivore}} attack {{with the release}} of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can attract predatory arthropods and/or repel herbivores and thus serve as a means of defense against herbivores. Such VOCs might also be perceived by neighboring plants to adjust their defensive phenotype according to the present risk of attack. We exposed lima bean plants at their natural growing site to volatiles of beetle-damaged conspecific shoots. This reduced herbivore damage and increased the growth rate of the exposed plants. To investigate whether VOCs also can serve in signaling processes within the same individual plant we focused on <b>undamaged</b> “receiver” <b>leaves</b> that were either exposed or not exposed to VOCs released by induced “emitter” leaves. Extrafloral nectar secretion by receiver leaves increased when they were exposed to VOCs of induced emitters of neighboring plants or of the same shoot, yet not when VOCs were removed from the system. Extrafloral nectar attracts predatory arthropods and represents an induced defense mechanism. The volatiles also primed extrafloral nectar secretion to show an augmented response to subsequent damage. Herbivore-induced VOCs elicit a defensive response in undamaged plants (or parts of plants) under natural conditions, and they function as external signal for within-plant communication, thus serving also a physiological role in the systemic response of a plant to local damage...|$|R

40|$|BBSRC BBS/E/W/ 10964 A 01 Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) have a {{recognized}} role during pathogen and arthropod attack. As an immediate consequence of such wounding, cellular compartmentation is destroyed allowing the chloroplastic PPO enzyme {{to interact with}} vacuolar substrates catalysing the oxidation of monophenols and/ or o-diphenols to o-diquinones. This ultimately results in {{a reduction in the}} nutritional value of wounded tissue through the formation of non-digestible secondary melanin pigments. However the chloroplastic location of PPO enzyme could indicate a role for PPO in undamaged tissues. In this study, a wild-type red clover population exhibiting high leaf PPO activity had significantly higher yield than a low leaf PPO mutant population while leaf isoflavonoids and hydroxycinnammates (PPO substrates) accumulated at similar levels in these plants. These data suggest that the presence of leaf PPO activity affects plant vigour. Understanding how this advantage is conferred requires knowledge of the cellular mechanism, including intra-organellar substrates. Here we present evidence of candidate PPO substrates within chloroplasts of wild-type red clover, including the monophenolic acid, coumaroyl malate and low levels of the diphenolic acid, phaselic acid (caffeoyl malate). Interestingly, chloroplastic phaselic acid concentration increased significantly under certain growth conditions. We discuss the implications of this in regard to a potential role for chloroplastic PPO in <b>undamaged</b> <b>leaves.</b> authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Unknown {{mechanisms}} tightly {{regulate the}} basal {{activity of the}} wound-inducible defence mediator jasmonate (JA) in undamaged tissues. However, the Arabidopsis fatty acid oxygenation upregulated 2 (fou 2) mutant in vacuolar two-pore channel 1 (TPC 1 (D 454 N)) displays high JA pathway activity in <b>undamaged</b> <b>leaves.</b> This mutant was used to explore mechanisms controlling basal JA pathway regulation. fou 2 was re-mutated to generate novel 'ouf' suppressor mutants. Patch-clamping {{was used to examine}} TPC 1 cation channel characteristics in the ouf suppressor mutants and in fou 2. Calcium (Ca(2 +)) imaging was used to study the effects fou 2 on cytosolic Ca(2 +) concentrations. Six intragenic ouf suppressors with near wild-type (WT) JA pathway activity were recovered and one mutant, ouf 8, affected the channel pore. At low luminal calcium concentrations, ouf 8 had little detectable effect on fou 2. However, increased vacuolar Ca(2 +) concentrations caused channel occlusion, selectively blocking K(+) fluxes towards the cytoplasm. Cytosolic Ca(2 +) concentrations in unwounded fou 2 were found to be lower than in the unwounded WT, but they increased in a similar manner in both genotypes following wounding. Basal JA pathway activity can be controlled solely by manipulating endomembrane cation flux capacities. We suggest that changes in endomembrane potential affect JA pathway activity...|$|E
40|$|Jasmonic acid (JA) is a lipid-derived {{signal that}} regulates plant defense {{responses}} to biotic stress. Here, we report {{the characterization of}} a JA-deficient mutant of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) that lacks local and systemic expression of defensive proteinase inhibitors (PIs) in response to wounding. Map-based cloning studies demonstrated that this phenotype results from loss of function of an acyl-CoA oxidase (ACX 1 A) that catalyzes {{the first step in}} the peroxisomal b-oxidation stage of JA biosynthesis. Recombinant ACX 1 A exhibited a preference for C 12 and C 14 straight-chain acyl-CoAs and also was active in the metabolism of C 18 cyclopentanoid-CoA precursors of JA. The overall growth, development, and reproduction of acx 1 plants were similar to wild-type plants. However, the mutant was compromised in its defense against tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) attack. Grafting experiments showed that loss of ACX 1 A function disrupts the production of the transmissible signal for wound-induced PI expression but does not affect the recognition of this signal in <b>undamaged</b> responding <b>leaves.</b> We conclude that ACX 1 A is essential for the b-oxidation stage of JA biosynthesis and that JA or its derivatives is required both for antiherbivore resistance and the production of the systemic wound signal. These findings support a role for peroxisomes in the production of lipid-based signaling molecules that promote systemic defense responses...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{volatile}} stimuli in {{the long-range}} host-searching behaviour of the specialist parasitoidCotesia rubecula Marshall (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was studied. Components from the plant-host-complex Brussels sprouts (Brassica oleracea L. var. gemmifera (DC.) Schulz. cv. ‘Titurel’) -Pieris rapae L. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) were compared for their attractiveness in dual choice tests in a windtunnel. Stimuli from cabbage plants that were mechanically damaged or damaged byP. rapae caterpillars were {{more attractive to}} this parasitoid species than stimuli emitted by the host larvae or their faeces. Parasitoids preferred leaves from the plant-host-complex over artificially damaged <b>leaves.</b> <b>Undamaged</b> cabbage plants were the least attractive to the foraging females. These results indicate that in-flight searching behaviour ofC. rubecula is guided by plant-derived information and that for this specialist species more reliable and specific host-derived cues play a minor role at longer distances. ...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{respond to}} insect {{herbivory}} by producing dynamic changes in {{an array of}} defense-related volatile and nonvolatile secondary metabolites. A scaled response relative to herbivory levels and nutrient availability would be adaptive, particularly under nutrient-limited conditions, in minimizing the costs of expressed defensive pathways and synthesis. In this study, we investigated effects of varying nitrogen (N) fertilization (42, 112, 196, and 280 ppm N) on levels of cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum) phytohormones [jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) ], terpenoid aldehydes (hemigossypolone, heliocides H 1, H 2, H 3, and H 4), and volatile production in response to beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) herbivory. Additional bioassays assessed parasitoid (Cotesia marginiventris) host-searching success in response to cotton plants grown under various N fertilizer regimes. At low N input (42 ppm N), herbivore damage resulted in significant increases in local leaf tissue concentrations of JA and volatiles and in systemic accumulation of terpenoid aldehydes. However, increased N fertilization of cotton plants suppressed S. exigua-induced plant hormones and led to reduced production of various terpenoid aldehydes in damaged mature <b>leaves</b> and <b>undamaged</b> young <b>leaves.</b> While increased N fertilization significantly diminished herbivore-induced leaf volatile concentrations, the parasitism of S. exigua larvae by the parasitoid C. marginiventris in field cages did not differ among N treatments. This suggests that, despite significant N fertilization effects on herbivore-induced plant defenses, at short range, the parasitoids were unable to differentiate between S. exigua larvae feeding on physiologically different cotton plants that share large constitutive volatile pools releasable when damaged by herbivores...|$|R
