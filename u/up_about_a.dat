5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Boerstler {{made for}} Frenchman’s Creek but {{four of his}} eleven boats, “misled by the {{darkness}} of the night or the inexperienced rowers being unable to force them across the current, fell below, near the bridge and were forced to return”. Nevertheless, Boerstler’s seven remaining boats forced a landing, opposed by Lieutenant Bartley and his 37 men of the 49th Regiment. Boerstler led the attack, shooting with his pistol a British soldier who was about to bayonet him. Bartley's outnumbered force retired, pursued to the Frenchman's Creek Bridge by the Americans, who took two prisoners. Boerstler's men were then attacked by Captain Bostwick’s two companies of Norfolk Militia, who had advanced from Black Rock Ferry. After an exchange of fire in which Bostwick’s force lost 3 killed, 15 wounded and 6 captured, the Canadians retreated. Boerstler now encountered another problem: many of the axes provided for the destruction of the Frenchman’s Creek bridge were in the four boats that had turned back and those that were in the seven remaining boats had been left behind when the Americans fought their way ashore. Boerstler dispatched eight men under Lieutenant John Waring to “break up the bridge by any means which they could find”. Waring had torn <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> third of the planking on the bridge when it was learned from a prisoner that “the whole force from Fort Erie was coming down upon them”. Boerstler quickly re-embarked his command and rowed back to Buffalo, leaving behind Waring and his party at the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) {{divides the}} waters of the Columbia and its tributaries into three {{freshwater}} ecoregions, naming them Columbia Glaciated, Columbia Unglaciated, and Upper Snake. The Columbia Glaciated ecoregion, making <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> third of the total watershed, lies in the north and was covered with ice sheets during the Pleistocene. The ecoregion includes the mainstem Columbia north of the Snake River and tributaries such as the Yakima, Okanagan, Pend Oreille, Clark Fork, and Kootenay rivers. The effects of glaciation include a number of large lakes and a relatively low diversity of freshwater fish. The Upper Snake ecoregion is defined as the Snake River watershed above Shoshone Falls, which totally blocks fish migration. This region has 14species of fish, many of which are endemic. The Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion makes {{up the rest of the}} watershed. It includes the mainstem Columbia below the Snake River and tributaries such as the Salmon, John Day, Deschutes, and lower Snake Rivers. Of the three ecoregions it is the richest in terms of freshwater species diversity. There are 35species of fish, of which four are endemic. There are also high levels of mollusk endemism.|$|E

25|$|American Muslims {{come from}} various {{backgrounds}} and, {{according to a}} 2009 Gallup poll, {{are one of the}} most racially diverse religious groups in the United States.

Many of these have converted to Islam during the last seventy years. Conversion to Islam in large urban areas has also contributed to its growth over the years.|$|E
25|$|The Heuneburg yielded many finds marking it as a rich site, {{operating}} {{both as a}} local {{centre of}} production and as a hub for long-distance trade. These included a full bronze workshop, {{a high proportion of}} Greek vases (in fact, the fragments make <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> dozen Greek pots, indicating a larger amount than contemporary sites but also a very limited elite access to such material), and other imported raw materials like tin and amber. Much of the exotic material dates from after 530 BC. There was also a local tradition of producing painted and decorated (incised or stamped) pottery.|$|E

In late December, Määttä joined Finland for the 2013 World Junior Championships. Määttä was outshined by fellow Finnish defencemen Rasmus Ristolainen and Ville Pokka as Finland finished fourth in its pool, sending the team to the relegation round. Finland easily won its two relegation matches {{to stay in the}} top tier, though a seventh-place finish in the ten-nation tournament was nonetheless considered a disappointment.|$|E

25|$|The Western Federation of Miners {{left the}} IWW in 1907, but the IWW wanted the WFM back. The WFM had made <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> {{third of the}} IWW membership, and the western miners were tough union men, and good allies in a labor dispute. In 1908, Vincent St. John tried to {{organize}} a stealth takeover of the WFM. He wrote to WFM organizer Albert Ryan, encouraging him to find reliable IWW sympathizers at each WFM local, and have them appointed delegates to the annual convention by pretending to share whatever opinions of that local needed to become a delegate. Once at the convention, they could vote in a pro-IWW slate. St. Vincent promised: “… once we can control the officers of the WFM for the IWW, the big bulk of the membership will go with them.” But the takeover did not succeed.|$|E
25|$|Every {{school and}} {{department}} at the university was involved in some type of military research or training during World War II. During a project on radar receivers, Purdue physicists discovered properties of germanium {{that led to the}} making of the first transistor. The Army and the Navy conducted training programs at Purdue and more than 17,500 students, staff, and alumni served in the armed forces. Purdue set <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> hundred centers throughout Indiana to train skilled workers for defense industries. As veterans returned to the university under the G.I. Bill, first-year classes were taught at some of these sites to alleviate the demand for campus space. Four of these sites are now degree-granting regional campuses of the Purdue University system. Purdue’s on-campus housing became racially desegregated in 1947, following pressure from Purdue President Frederick L. Hovde and Indiana Governor Ralph F. Gates.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a Vril-Society was alleged in 1960 by Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels. In their book The Morning of the Magicians, they claimed that the Vril-Society was a secret community of occultists in pre-Nazi Berlin that {{was a sort of}} inner circle of the Thule Society. They also thought that it was in close contact with the English group known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Vril information takes <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> tenth of the volume, the remainder of which details other esoteric speculations, but the authors fail to clearly explain whether this section is fact or fiction. Historians have shown that there has been no actual historical foundation for the claims of Pauwels and Bergier, and that the article of Willy Ley has only been a vague inspiration for their own ideas. Nevertheless, Pauwels and Bergier have influenced a whole new literary genre dealing with the alleged occult influences on National Socialism which have often been related to the fictional Vril Society.|$|E

500|$|The Village Voices Sean Fennessey {{commented that}} the {{production}} by Bink! was gorgeous in nature. He compared the original three-minute long version of the song to {{the one on the}} album, writing that the original [...] "was affecting, funny (“I ordered the jerk, she said 'You are what you eat.'”) and soulful—a touch of the old Ye. And just three minutes long. But the album version is something bigger, with a magisterial guest verse from Rick Ross (appearing twice here) that comes after an odd but sumptuous acid-jazz breakdown." [...] Craig Jenkins [...] of Prefix Music opined that [...] "Bink’s beat for 'Devil in a New Dress' peters out midway through, and a live band plays a sultry, emotive take on that beat." [...] Andrew Barber of Complex stated that for the people disappointed in the briefness of the verses provided by Ross on [...] "Monster", this track more than makes up for it. Barber favorably compared the track to the style of West's older songs, and commented that it showcased West's [...] "softer, more vulnerable side, opening <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> woman." ...|$|E

500|$|Only days later, Carey began posting {{irregular}} voice {{notes and}} messages on her official website: [...] "I'm {{trying to understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself." [...] Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been [...] "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" [...] when she posted the letters. On July26, she was hospitalized, citing [...] "extreme exhaustion" [...] and a [...] "physical and emotional breakdown". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.|$|E
500|$|Life Is Peachy {{opens with}} the forty-nine second prelude [...] "Twist", {{which is made}} up of improvised scat singing done by Davis. Doug Small {{described}} the singing as [...] "spitting out the twisted rantings of a madman", and said that it was fit for the album's introduction.

Davis said that the song [...] "Chi" [...] is [...] "about a lot of alcohol and drug abuse". The song was named after Cheng for the sole reason that Cheng liked reggae and had taken it into his head that the song [...] "Chi" [...] was actually a reggae song. [...] "Swallow" [...] is about drug-induced paranoia. [...] "Mr. Rogers" [...] is about Fred Rogers. Davis said: [...] "As a kid, he told me to be polite, and all it did was get me picked on.
