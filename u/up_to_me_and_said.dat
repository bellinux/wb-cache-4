25|$|By {{the end of}} September 1957, {{the nine}} were {{admitted}} to Little Rock Central High {{under the protection of}} the 101st Airborne Division (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never saw her again.|$|E
500|$|For Streep, {{the most}} {{significant}} thing about the film was that [...] "his was the first time, on any movie I have ever made, where men came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I know what you felt like, {{this is kind of}} like my life.' That was for me the most ground-breaking thing about Devil Wears Pradaâ€”it engaged men on a visceral level," [...] she told Indiewire.|$|E
500|$|Matt Groening noted: [...] "I can't {{tell you}} how many times people have come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I know who you based that comic book guy on. It's that comic-book guy right down the block.' And I have to tell them, 'No, it's every comic-bookstore guy in America.'" [...] Cast member Hank Azaria based Comic Book Guy's voice on a student who went by the name [...] "F" [...] and lived in the room next door at his college.|$|E

500|$|Keith Miller {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the Second World War. It changed him ... In the first post-war Ashes Test ... England were caught on a sticky ... Bill Edrich came in. He'd had a serious war and he survived and Miller thought, 'He's my old Services mate. The last thing he wants after five years' war is to be flattened by a cricket ball, so I eased up. Bradman came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Don't slow down, Keith. Bowl quicker.' That remark put me off Test cricket. Never {{felt the same way}} about it after that.' ...|$|E
500|$|In 1987, he {{was chosen}} to captain the England B team in a match against the full {{national}} team of Malta, but {{it was to be}} his only appearance in an England shirt, and he has subsequently been described {{as one of the best}} defenders of his era never to be selected for the full England team. Bruce later stated, [...] "I bumped into former England manager Bobby Robson in Benfica (sic). He came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'I should have capped you'. It was nice to hear but it still didn't get me one .... I'll always be a little disappointed I didn't get one." ...|$|E
500|$|Recognizing Dylan's {{dissatisfaction with}} the {{progress}} of the recordings, producer Bob Johnston suggested that they move the sessions to Nashville. Johnston lived there and had extensive experience working with Nashville session musicians. He recalled how Dylan manager Albert Grossman, was hostile to the idea: [...] "Grossman came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'If you ever mention Nashville to Dylan again, you're gone.' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'You heard me. We got a thing going here'". Despite Grossman's opposition, Dylan agreed to Johnston's suggestion, and preparations were made to record the album at Columbia's A Studio on Nashville's Music Row in February 1966.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story. One of the ideas {{that came out of}} the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. [...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.' So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, 'Hey, let's do a film about monsters.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, it was {{announced}} that Wood would take a brief break from the program to film the fifth installment in the Final Destination film series, Final Destination 5. Wood recorded several scenes in advance of her planned absence. In May 2012, when The Bold and the Beautiful was shooting [...] Hope and Liam's wedding on location in Italy, Wood performed her own stunts in a drowning scene. Wood learned about her Daytime Emmy nomination just before filming a scene in the Adriatic sea, stating, [...] "I was just about to shoot a scene in the Adriatic sea in Italy. The water was only 54 degrees! [...] Brad Bell came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "How {{does it feel to be}} Emmy nominated?" ...|$|E
500|$|TV Guide {{referred}} to Todd as a breakout character. At {{the height of}} his popularity, which was called [...] "Todd-mania" [...] and [...] "the Todd Manning phenomenon", Howarth was disturbed that so many women were attracted to Todd and that the show's writers had begun to redeem the character. [...] In a September 1995 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the publication stated that Howarth was troubled that [...] "his villainous character became such a fan favorite". In October 1995, Howarth told SOD, [...] "People have come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I say to that? I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.' But I have to say, it's disturbing." [...] He gave credit to the show's writers for Todd's popularity, saying that the rapists' trial was well constructed and added, [...] "I think, right now, we're just riding the wave of something that started last summer. Beyond that, I don't really know why people like Todd".|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop a bit," [...] said Tom. [...] "Turn your tail <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I'll {{pull you}} through hindforemost, {{and then you}} won't stick in the spikes." ...|$|R

2500|$|Margules' sister, actress Annette Margules, {{remembered him}} as {{charitable}} and generous {{to all who}} needed help. He took care of people, he even fed people.

2500|$|... "Although I lost to {{a popular}} {{governor}} with his arm in a sling from the Kennedy tragedy, I think I was successful in helping to establish the Republican Party [...] [...] [...] to make Texas a two-party state. I met and made friends with some wonderful people who shared my views. An example; twenty years after the election I was in an airport in Baltimore, and an elderly lady came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I was your precinct chairman in Brownsville, and I'll always be grateful for your effort in the 1964 election.' Such an appreciation made my efforts in 1964 worthwhile." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Panthers held a [...] "Year of the Rat" [...] alumni reunion in 2007 to {{celebrate}} the 1996 team and {{raise money for the}} Florida Panthers Foundation. As part of the event, the Panthers sold plastic rats for fans to toss onto the ice during the exhibition game, which saw the participation of at least nineteen members of the 1996 team. Mellanby, who retired in 2007, was always remembered for spawning the rat trick. [...] "It became the motto of our team that season. When I played in the all-star game, a kid came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'You're the rat guy.' He didn't even know my name; he just knew I killed the rat." ...|$|E

2500|$|Howarth {{went on to}} say Todd and Marty {{suddenly}} bonding did {{not make}} sense and that he could not, in good conscience, promote the story of Todd Lord, who had become a likeable character. [...] "If the rape had been an unrealistic, soapy thing, then it wouldn't matter. But because it was so in-depth and so brutal, to show Todd and Marty having drinks together in Rodi's [...] to show Marty feeling safe and comfortable with Todd [...] is bizarre," [...] he said. [...] "People have come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I say to that? I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.'

2500|$|In {{the initial}} {{concept of the}} series, the three females' boss would be a millionaire who often aided them in their assignments; however, Jackson and Spelling {{decided it would be}} more {{interesting}} to have the boss's identity remain a secret. With this, millionaire Charlie Townsend was an unseen character on the series who only spoke to the Angels via a Western Electric Speakerphone. John Forsythe, who played the unseen Charlie Townsend, directing the 'Angels' crime-fighting operations over a speaker-phone, recorded his lines in an audio studio and was never on set. Thus, Forsythe rarely met any of his female co-stars. Some years later, he bumped into Farrah Fawcett-Majors at the tennis courts, as he recalled, [...] "I was coming off the court when she came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Charlie! I finally met Charlie!'". Forsythe was offered the 'Charlie' role in a panicky late-night phone call from producer Aaron Spelling after the original choice, American film, stage and television actor, Gig Young, showed up too intoxicated to read his lines. [...] "I didn't even take my pajamas off â€“ I just put on my topcoat and drove over to Fox. When it was finished, Aaron Spelling said, 'That's perfect.' And I went home and went back to bed".|$|E
2500|$|Ultimately {{all that}} {{remained}} of the band according to Franklin was, [...] "myself, Jimmy Hartridge and some effects pedals", though Moulder still anticipated producing a full-length Swervedriver album. Franklin and Hartridge laid the groundwork for a new album at EMI's demoing studio near Oxford Street in London, and while recording newly written [...] "Duress" [...] with producer Marc Waterman, he introduced them to Jeremy [...] "Jez" [...] Hindmarsh, ex-drummer of the London band [...] (Waterman had produced their first album.) Later that night, Hindmarsh approached the duo at The Murray Arms bar in Camden Town and pitched them his services, including use of his 16-track studio equipment. They accepted and Swervedriver had their new drummer. The group got to work on recording their new album first at Playground rehearsal studios in Camden and then Trident 2 studios in Strutton Ground in Westminster, with Franklin and Hartridge splitting bass duties. Swervedriver would still need a bassist when the show hit the road, and Franklin would encounter him at another bar in Camden. About meeting Essex-native Steve George, Franklin recalled, [...] "He actually came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Youâ€™re the guy from Swervedriver. You need a bass player. Iâ€™m your man.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "At 12 noon on the {{eleventh}} {{day of the}} Fifth Month, my train from Hangchow arrived at the North Station Shanghai. In order to go quickly to the bank to send the money, I left my luggage at the depository and carried only a small bag with me. As soon as I {{came out of the}} train station, I saw a rather luxurious automobile and four Westerners standing by it. I did not realize that they were French, because in Shanghai there was a great mixture of Westerners and there were swarms of foreign visitors. It was quite common for cars to be used to pick up hotel guests. Little did I know that this car was there to kidnap someone! When I had gone a few steps from the station, one of the Westerners came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> in Mandarin: 'This car is very nice; please get in.' I politely refused, saying 'I do not need a car.' Suddenly, one of the Westerners behind the car with a great heave pushed me inside it, the engine accelerated and we were off like a shot. In no time we had already entered the French Concession. The car drew up to the waterfront, where a French warship was docked. I now became a prisoner on this warship." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Wood {{received}} her first nomination for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series for her portrayal of Steffy at the 39th Daytime Emmy Awards. Of learning about her Emmy nomination, she said, [...] "I {{was just about}} to shoot a scene in the Adriatic sea in Italy. The water was only 54 degrees! [...] Brad Bell came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "How {{does it feel to be}} Emmy nominated?" [...] For that year, Wood submitted the scenes in which Steffy is informed of the end of her affair with Bill. In 2013, Wood garnered her second consecutive nomination in that category at the 40th Daytime Emmy Awards, in which she submitted the scenes where Steffy surprises Liam (Scott Clifton) by presenting him with signed annulment papers. In May 2013, news broke that Wood had opted not to renew her contract with the show in order to take another break. A representative for the show stated: [...] " [...] is taking short a break, as she has done in the past, from B. She remains as the character of 'Steffy Forrester' and is continuing to tape, currently with episodes airing through July 2013 and then beyond". It was later announced that Wood has decided to remain with the series on a recurring basis. In April 2015, it was announced that Wood would reprise her role on B on a contract basis, which she has remained on ever since.|$|E
