40|$|The {{role played}} by <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>frequencies</b> or ultrashort {{distances}} in the usual derivation of the Hawking effect is discussed. We demonstrate the robustness of Hawking's prediction of black-hole evaporation, by carrying out an explicit calculation, in which short-distance physics is explicitly regularized using the Pauli-Villars regularization scheme. We find that short-distance effects due to physics at small distance scales, 1 /$ Lambda gg 1 /T sb{H}$, where 1 /$ Lambda$ is a covariantly chosen short-distance cutoff, can only contribute to the Hawking flux an amount that is exponentially suppressed by the large ratio $ Lambda$/$T sb{H}$. We argue further that this behavior is not specific to our choice of regularization, but is a generic feature of any covariant short-distance regularization. We do so by showing that no possible covariant and local counterterm exists which {{can contribute to the}} Hawking flux at late times far from the hole...|$|R

40|$|The basic {{concepts}} and some preliminary calculations are presented showing {{the feasibility of}} high speed optical and infrared modulators based on resonant tunneling structures. A modulator based on a conventional resonant tunneling structure can be operated in the infrared region by using the intersubband transitions and in the optical region by using the valence band to conduction band transitions in the quantum well of the double barrier structure. A novel resonant tunneling structure is proposed as a modulator in which the quantum well conduction band at zero bias is below the collector layer conduction band. This deep well resonant tunneling structure can allow intersubband transitions with higher energy than its conventional counterpart and with a careful design may even result in population inversion and gain.

This paper investigates how wall roughness affects radio propagation in tunnels, and presents a unified ray tracing and modal method for modeling radio propagation in tunnels with rough walls. First, general analytical formulas for modeling the influence of the wall roughness are derived, based on the modal method and the ray tracing method, respectively. Second, the equivalence of the ray tracing and modal methods in the presence of wall roughnesses is mathematically proved, by showing that the ray tracing-based analytical formula can converge to the modal-based formula through the Poisson summation formula. The derivation and findings are verified by simulation results based on ray tracing and modal methods.

40|$|A {{discussion}} of the anomalous low-temperature thermal properties of amorphous materials is first given as a theoretical framework in which {{the rest of the}} thesis is treated. The theory models the form and function of microscopic dynamical and structural features that are thought to be common to amorphous materials, which interact strongly with <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>frequency</b> acoustic waves and creating the anomalies. The model has been found to well reproduce the measured anomalous thermal conductivity of silica glass. Separately, an experiment which utilizes impulsive stimulated thermal scattering is used to measure the anomalous low-temperature thermal conductivity of a molecular glass, glycerol. The results, taken {{in the context of the}} aforementioned theory, illustrate the ambiguity of using a macroscopic measurement to quantify microscopic parameters. However the validity of the microscopic assumptions of the theory has heretofore been difficult to test directly due to a lack of a proper experimental method. The remainder of the thesis is devoted to developing a technique of generating <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>frequency</b> acoustic waves, which can be used to directly probe the dynamics and structure believed to dominate the low-temperature thermal properties of amorphous materials. The generation of <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>frequency</b> tunable narrowband acoustic waves is accomplished with a novel retroreflection-based ultrafast pulse shaper. It generates optical pulse sequences of frequency tunable between 2 - 2000 GHz through movement of a single delay line. Optical to acoustic conversion by aluminum transducers yields acoustic waves with bandwidth limited by the metal temporal response to 2 - 500 GHz. The detection of the <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>frequency</b> acoustic waves is accomplished with a novel grating-based interferometer. (cont.) The alignment, flexibility, and calibration of the interferometer is described. Lastly the use of the technique is illustrated for the characterization of the structure and dynamics of silica glass, the prototypical amorphous material, at room temperature and at 20 K. The room temperature results are considered in terms of the only other data available in the literature, and the 20 K data are considered in terms of the theory of amorphous materials, as no other information has been published in this temperature and frequency range. Both results suggest that current models of amorphous materials be reconsidered. by Jaime Dawn Choi. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Chemistry, 2005.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{electronic}} technology, researchers are devoting increasing interests to wireless power transfer methods. Generally finite-element method (FEM) is {{a powerful tool for}} numerical simulation of such systems. Due to the relatively high operating frequency, the presence of inductance and distributed capacitance in the system as well as eddy current and displacement current become two essential issues in the study of electromagnetic field distribution in wireless power transfer systems. One of the major problems to be addressed is the gap between low and high frequencies as conventional low frequency methods cannot include displacement current, while common high frequency methods focus mainly on the <b>ultrahigh</b> <b>frequencies,</b> such as in antenna studies. In this paper, a 3 -D FEM including displacement current is developed to model wireless power transfer system to include displacement current and eddy current and close the gap of high and low frequency modeling methods.

Radio Acoustic Sounding Systems (RASS), Doppler-acoustic sodars, <b>Ultrahigh</b> <b>Frequencies</b> (UHF) profilers and lidars have many advantages in measuring wind and temperature profiles in the lower atmospheric boundary layer since they can operate more or less continuously and unattended; however, there are limitations in their operational use at airports. For example, profilers deteriorate (limited altitude coverage or missing) in moderate or greater rain and can be affected by airplane targets in their field of view. Sodars can handle precipitation better but are affected by the high noise environments of airports and strong winds. Morning temperature inversions typically limit performance of RASS, sodars and profilers. Fog affects sonic anemometers. Lidars can have difficulties in clouds, fog or heavy precipitation. Despite their limitations these sensors have proven useful to provide wind and temperature profiles for AVOSS. Capabilities and limitations of these and other sensors used in the AVOSS program are discussed, parameter settings for the sensor systems are documented, and recommendations are made for the most cost-effective group of sensors for the future.
