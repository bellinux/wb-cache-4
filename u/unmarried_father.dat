40|$|Summary: Very {{little is}} known about the almost a million <b>unmarried</b> <b>fathers</b> whose {{children}} were lost to adoption in England and Wales in the mid- 20 th century. 1 Between the first Adoption Act and the present day nearly 900, 000 adoptions have taken place. • Findings: In the context of the social conditions of the years between 1926 and the present, the data report the experiences and reflect the emotions of the original fathers concerning the discovery of their partner’s pregnancy, the process of the child’s adoption and their searching and sometimes reunion with their adult adopted individuals. The study consists of self-selected contributors and does not claim to be representative of all <b>unmarried</b> <b>fathers.</b> • Applications: The reasons why these men were excluded from the decision concerning the child’s adoption are posited. Original parents now have the right to apply for information concerning their adopted adult children and it is likely that social workers will be contacted by the original fathers as well as other individuals in the biological family.

50|$|Child custody laws, {{affecting}} fathers {{parental rights}} over {{their children from}} birth until child custody ends at age 18, may {{have an effect on}} the birth rate. US states strict in enforcing child support have up to 20 percent fewer unmarried births than states that are lax about getting <b>unmarried</b> <b>fathers</b> to pay, the researchers found. Moreover, according to the results, if all 50 states in the United States had done at least as well in their enforcement efforts as the state ranked fifth from the top, that would have led to a 20 percent reduction in out-of-wedlock births.|$|R
50|$|The United Kingdom has {{a parental}} {{responsibility}} concept {{in the law}} that requires parents {{to meet the needs}} of children, such as a right to a home and a right to be maintained. The law does not see children as having a right to care by both biological parents as a default matter. Instead it holds responsible all mothers but only (a) married fathers (for any child born to the father's wife) and (b) <b>unmarried</b> <b>fathers</b> who assert such responsibility in an agreement with the mother or by court order. It also states that all parents have financial responsibility for their children.|$|R
5000|$|The {{steps that}} an <b>unmarried</b> <b>father</b> must take {{in order to}} obtain rights to his child vary by country. In some {{countries}} (such as the UK - since 2003 in England and Wales, 2006 in Scotland, and 2002 in Northern Ireland) it is sufficient for the father to be listed on the birth certificate for him to have parental rights; in other countries, such as Ireland, simply being listed on the birth certificate does not offer any rights, additional legal steps must be taken (if the mother agrees, the parents can both sign a [...] "statutory declaration", but if the mother does not agree, the father has to apply to court).|$|E
50|$|Exceptions {{apply in}} the case of {{children}} with single parents. Children born out of wedlock are registered under the mother's maiden name (if still unmarried), applying her middle name (maternal surname) for the child's last name, respectively. The <b>unmarried</b> <b>father</b> must resort to legal and administrative procedures if he desires to acknowledge the child as his own and for the child to be registered with his own surname (in which case the child will use the mother's surname as his/her middle name). Likewise, children raised by single fathers take the current surname (paternal surname) with no middle name, whether or not the mother's identity is known. These exceptions also apply to Filipino children who have non-Filipino descent.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we employ {{data from the}} Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study in order to {{estimate}} a model of underground labor supply developed by Lemieux et al. (1994). We focus specifically on the underground labor supply of <b>unmarried</b> <b>fathers,</b> {{a group that is}} likely to have significant involvement in the underground economy. We also extend the empirical analysis of Lemieux et al. by taking into account exogenous state and local variation in marginal tax rates, as well as sociodemographic variables related to the likelihood of participation in the underground. In accordance with expectations, we find that a significant proportion of <b>unmarried</b> <b>fathers</b> report participation in the underground. However, although the theoretical model predicts a positive relationship between the tax rate and underground hours of work (under certain conditions), we find that the effect of the tax rate on hours is statistically indistinguishable from zero, even after including exogenous variation in tax rates. We also fail to find a positive and statistically significant effect of the tax rate on participation in the underground. Within the context of the model, these results have specific implications for the magnitudes of the probability of detection and the penalty on evaded tax. Therefore, we conclude that additional empirical information is needed regarding these parameters. Future research might also employ other datasets in the estimation of the theoretical model outlined by Lemieux et al., as well as investigate the applicability of other models of underground labor supply. ...|$|R

5000|$|As {{a general}} rule, an <b>unmarried</b> <b>father</b> cannot pass on British {{citizenship}} automatically {{in the case}} of a child born before 1 July 2006. If the parents marry subsequent to the birth the child normally becomes a British citizen at that point if legitimated by the marriage and the father was eligible to pass on British citizenship. If the unmarried British father was domiciled in a country that treated (at the date of birth of the child born before 1 July 2006) a child born to unmarried parents in the same way as a child born to married parents, then the father passed on British citizenship automatically to his child, even though the child was born before 1 July 2006 to unmarried parents. Such countries are listed in the UK Home Office Immigration and Passport Services publication [...] "Legitimation and Domicile". Failing that, the child can be registered as British if it would have been British if parents were married and application is made before the child is 18.|$|E
50|$|Having PRRs entitles {{a parent}} to take key {{decisions}} relating to the child, such as where they will live and go to school, and what medical treatment they should receive. In addition, parents {{have an obligation to}} provide financial support for their children under the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985 (c 37) and the Child Support Act 1991 (c 38). In certain circumstances, this obligation continues when the child in question is beyond the age at which the parents have parental responsibilities under section 1 of the 1995 Act. The child’s mother (irrespective of whether she is married to the child’s father (s3(1)(a))) and the child’s father, if he is “married to the mother {{at the time of the}} child’s conception or subsequently” (s 3(1)(b)), have automatic rights. In line with Scottish Law Commission proposals in 1992, the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006 has brought Scots law in line with English law to the extent that an <b>unmarried</b> <b>father</b> will obtain parental rights and responsibilities if he is registered as the father on the birth register. A married father’s PRRs continue after divorce, unless they are specifically removed by a court. If unmarried fathers or stepparents do not have PRRs, they must either make a Section 4 Agreement, or apply to the court under section 11 for rights.|$|E
50|$|The {{legal status}} of an <b>unmarried</b> <b>father</b> differs greatly from country to country. Without {{voluntary}} formal recognition of the child by the father, in most cases {{there is a need}} of due process of law in order to establish paternity. In some countries however, unmarried cohabitation of a couple for a specific period of time does create a presumption of paternity similar to that of formal marriage. This is the case in Australia. Under what circumstances can a paternity action be initiated, the rights and responsibilities of a father once paternity has been established (whether he can obtain parental responsibility and whether he can be forced to support the child) as well as the legal position of a father who voluntarily acknowledges the child, vary widely by jurisdiction. A special situation arises when a married woman has a child by a man other than her husband. Some countries, such as Israel, refuse to accept a legal challenge of paternity in such a circumstance, {{in order to avoid the}} stigmatization of the child (see Mamzer, a concept under Jewish law). In 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of a German man who had fathered twins with a married woman, granting him right of contact with the twins, despite the fact that the mother and her husband had forbidden him to see the children.|$|E
