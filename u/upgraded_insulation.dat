A transient heat and mass transfer model which predicts thermal performance of residential attics (Medina, 1992) was {{coupled with an}} "economic" subroutine. Simple payback periods were estimated which were based on current insulation and radiant barrier (RB) prices (materials and installation), and current and forecast electric rates.

40|$|AbstractThe UK faces a {{significant}} retrofit challenge, especially with its housing stock of old, hard-to-treat solid walled dwellings. In this work, we investigate {{the delivery of}} heated thermal comfort with a lower energy demand through four types of energy efficiency interventions: passive system, conversion device, method of service control, and level of service demanded. These are compared for three distinct household occupancy patterns, corresponding to a working family, a working couple and a daytime-present couple. Energy efficiency measures are considered singly and in combination, to study whether multiple lower cost measures can achieve comparable savings to higher cost individual measures. Scenarios are simulated using engineering building modelling software TRNSYS with data taken from literature. <b>Upgraded</b> <b>insulation</b> of wall and roof resulted in highest savings in all occupancy scenarios, but comparable savings were calculated for reduced internal temperature and partial spatial heating in scenarios in which the house is not at maximum capacity. Zonal heating control is expected to achieve greatest savings for the working couple who had a flexible occupancy pattern.

40|$|Abstract: The {{previous}} findings of an energy efficiency retrofit programme of state houses in southern New Zealand regions indicated that low internal temperatures {{occurred during the}} winter months and that it was difficult to reach minimum levels of indoor comfort. Houses were found to be 0. 4 ºC warmer (annual average increase) after a ceiling/underfloor <b>insulation</b> <b>upgrade</b> with 0. 6 ºC increase recorded in winter months when corrected for energy consumption and weather conditions. A small reduction in energy consumption was also found. The findings were quite surprising as the upgrade program had the goal of making houses warmer by reducing heat loss through improved thermal insulation in the houses. Householders provided very little heating to living areas and even less to bedrooms. Indoor temperatures were found to be very low and did not come close to the WHO recommendations. The present paper investigates alternatives to provide a higher level of thermal comfort. To this end two houses were ”borrowed ” from the Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC) in order to undertake intensive monitoring after a range of improvements were made to the building envelope.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{behavior change}} strategies to increase CT residential energy efficiency uptake {{in the context}} of an action research pilot. Action research includes experimental pilot deployment within a realworld system, continuously analyzing customers participating in their daily lives. The approach allows for simultaneous planning, execution, and evaluation, as well as concurrent development of major program changes, real-time solutions, and innovative responses. The Connecticut Neighbor to Neighbor Energy Challenge (N 2 N), in which my research was conducted, was designed to determine the minimum conditions necessary to administer cost-effective community and behavior-based energy efficiency programs. Customers in 14 small towns complete energy savings actions, such as efficient lighting, weatherization, and <b>upgrades,</b> like <b>insulation,</b> appliance <b>upgrades,</b> advanced air sealing, and renewable energy installations. N 2 N meets customers where they are already going (e. g., in the field) by partnering with local community groups, town governments, low income and senior organizations, faith communities, education facilities, and business organizations, and using social and earned media channels. I describe the N 2 N opportunity; program design, execution, and evaluation; primary behavioral research, especially the DOE Home Energy Score behavioral economics experiment; and the post-grant transition process. Four main pilot implementation components were used, including: lead generation using behavioral marketing, research, and outreach approaches; a technology platform closely tracking the customer; a continuous process of evaluation; and frequently published results dashboards. The research discovered gaps in program performance that will hinder meeting CT's long-term energy, efficiency, and carbon reduction goals. N 2 N is also finding evidence of increasing rates of upgrade uptake, where word of mouth and self-herding (e. g., where people follow past behavior) leads to action for others, as well as additional actions in individual households, respectively. The research finds two main recommendations for CT energy efficiency programs: 1) Continue to fund fast-paced, testing grounds for efficiency programs outside of current regulatory constraints to: inform program design and policy decisions, as well as direct market innovation, and 2) Use social and behavioral approaches to encourage viral spreading of efficiency uptake. by Kat A.

Installation of fiberglass attic insulation {{in the nearly}} 3 million electricity-heated homes throughout California {{is used as a}} case study. The pollutants nitrous oxides (NO{sub x}), sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }), fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5), benzo(a) pyrene, benzene, and naphthalene are selected for the assessment. Exposure is characterized separately for rural and urban environments using the CalTOX model, which is a key input to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemicals and other environmental Impacts (TRACI). The output of CalTOX provides for urban and rural populations emissions-to-intake factors, which are expressed as an individual intake fraction (iFi). The typical iFi from power plant emissions are on the order of 10 {sup - 13 } (g intake per g emitted) in urban and rural regions.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} by studying possible renovation of a two-storey detached multifamily building by using passive solar design options in a cold climate in Borlänge, Sweden where the heating Degree Days are 4451 (base 20 °C). Borlänge`s housing company, Tunabyggen, plans to renovate the project house located inthe multicultural district, Jakobsgårdarna. The goal of the thesis was to suggest a redesign of the current building, decrease the heating energy use, by applying passive solar design and control strategies, in a most reasonable way. In addition ensure a better thermal comfort for the tenants in the dwellings. Literatures have been studied, from which can be inferred that passive design should be abasic design consideration for all housing constructions, because it has advantages to ensure thermal comfort, and reduce the energy use. In addition further savings can be achieved applying different types of control strategies, from which the house will be more personalized, and better adapted to the user’s needs. The proposed method is based on simulations by using TRNSYS software. First a proper building model was set up, which represents {{the current state of the}} project building.

40|$|The {{ambition}} {{to renovate the}} post-war building stock to an energy-neutral quality is {{getting a lot of}} attention from social housing corporations and other institutional owners, financial organizations, and users. An effective renovation plan must significantly improve the current energy performance of a target building towards nearly zero-energy levels. A number of facade solutions have been developed in recent years to solve the problem of large-scale renovation of housing. In the Netherlands, several exemplary renovation projects have the {{ambition to}} achieve an energy-neutral objective. One such project is the 2 ndSkin Façade refurbishment approach for post-war residential buildings. Nevertheless, the market intake of such renovation is currently very slow, as housing associations are reluctant to invest the increased cost of a zero-energy refurbishment, despite the energy savings and ongoing benefits for the occupants. Within the framework of the research project 2 ndSkin, this paper presents a prefabricated and integrated façade module that provides the possibility to improve energy performance up to zero-energy use, while ensuring minimum disturbance for the occupants, both during and after renovation. Based on the proposed integrated refurbishment solution, the study presents a financial breakdown of this case-study concept - including options to lower the initial investment - in order to outline a more attractive business case. Firstly, three design variations, ranging from a standard external <b>insulation</b> <b>upgrade</b> to a zero-energy renovation, are compared, using a range of positive, average, and negative values for a series of financial and economic parameters. Subsequently, the financial performance of a zero-energy renovation investment is calculated for three different apartment properties with diverse market values, to determine the circumstances that can justify an energy renovation investment. The analysis showed that, for properties with an intermediate to high market value, the investment can be attractive under current economic and market conditions, but this attractiveness drops significantly for lower-cost properties such as social housing. The study objective is to develop both the technical solution and the related business case to support the implementation of zero-energy refurbishment strategies into diverse real estate market tiers of the residential building stock.

40|$|Improving {{the energy}} {{efficiency}} of the existing building stock is beneficial in terms of reducing both operational cost and environmental impact. Solid, load bearing masonry buildings comprise an appreciable part of the existing building stock, are valued for their durability and are often of historical significance, however their thermal performance is often poor. Thermal <b>upgrades</b> with interior <b>insulation</b> are usually considered risky as this lowers the drying potential of the wall enclosure which increases the moisture content of the masonry, possibly to damaging levels during freeze-thaw cycles. The current approach to assessing the suitability of brick for exterior use is based on acceptance criteria or a severe freeze-thaw test as prescribed by ASTM and CSA. The first method {{is based on an}} incomplete understanding of freeze-thaw physics. The second method subjects the bricks to a set of conditions that cannot encompass the highly variable range of in-service exposures. Past research indicates that rigid porous materials, such as brick and concrete, experience frost damage only if saturated beyond a fixed, critical degree of saturation. A more useful approach to assessing the risk of damage due to freeze-thaw would be to determine the critical degree of saturation of a material and then compare that to anticipated moisture loads under service conditions using computer modelling software such as WUFI. A test method was developed to determine the critical degree of saturation of a material requiring less than two weeks of testing by means of frost dilatometry. Representative brick were first sliced into 10 mm thick specimens. Material properties of the brick specimens were determined, including dry weight, dry density, porosity (determined by either boiling or vacuum saturation), water uptake coefficient (A-value), and initial length, to allow for computer modeling and analysis of results. The specimens were wetted to various degrees of saturation (based on either boil or vacuum saturation), sealed in a manner to ensure minimal moisture loss, and then subjected to at least six freeze-thaw cycles. The change in length of the specimens following freeze thaw testing was measured and the expansion, which in this study was expressed in terms of microstrain, plotted against degree of saturation. Any specimen that experienced expansion greater than that attributable to instrument error was considered damaged by frost. Determining the total open porosity of a material, necessary for measuring degree of saturation, is difficult due to close voids and trapped air in dead end pores. Boiling saturation and vacuum saturation are two methods commonly used to determine open porosity. For the size of specimens used in the test, almost all water absorption when using the boil method occurred during the first hour of boiling and first hour of soaking. The repeatability of boiling to determine total open porosity is low, with approximately 10 % variability experienced over three rounds of boiling. Specimens absorbed a greater or equal amount of moisture using the vacuum saturation method than the boiling saturation method, indicating that vacuum saturation is more effective at determining total open porosity. The repeatability of vacuum saturation is good with very little variability observed over 3 rounds. The benefit of boiling saturation is that its equipment requirements and procedure are simpler than that of vacuum saturation. Freeze-thaw cycling was carried out by immersing the sealed specimens in a liquid bath. The change in length was determined by measuring pins attached to the specimens with an outside digital micrometer with a ratchet stop. A combination of experimentation and computer modeling showed that the samples could be wetted to target moisture contents with excellent accuracy and that moisture redistributed evenly in less than 24 hours for most samples. The minimum required temperature of the freeze cycle was chosen to be less than - 12 °C, in order to freeze all water contained in pores with a radius of 10 nm and greater. It was determined, for the small specimen sizes used, that the cooling and warming phases should be at least one hour in duration to ensure that the specimens entirely freeze and thaw. Three sets of brick were subjected to the test to determine their critical degree of saturation: modern extruded brick, pressed brick from the 1950 s, and historic brick dating to the 1870 s. The older bricks experienced frost dilatation above 0. 25 and 0. 30 vacuum saturation respectively, with no damage evident below these thresholds. The modern extruded brick only experienced damage at 0. 87 of vacuum saturation and greater. Knowledge of the critical degree of saturation of a brick allows architects and engineers to pursue retrofit strategies that increase thermal performance without jeopardizing the durability of the material by creating the conditions that allow the moisture content to increase to dangerous levels...|$|R
