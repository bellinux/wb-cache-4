5|$|The Mark II {{telescope}} once constructed {{was also}} used as an interferometer with the Lovell telescope. This has a baseline of 425 m (1,394ft) (meaning that it can synthesize a telescope with 425 m diameter), giving it a resolution of around 0.5 arcminutes. This telescope pair {{has been used to}} carry out survey work, and to determine the positions of faint radio objects. Also, one of the drivers behind the construction of the Mark III was to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> interferometer with the Mark I to carry out a survey of radio sources.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example {{can be found in the}} works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar Rhazes, writer of Secret of Secrets, which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol and <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a laxative. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as scabies. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that she}} might be Kerner's next target, Indy travels to New York City in order to warn her and {{to find out more about}} the mysterious statue. There, he {{interrupts}} her lecture on the culture and downfall of Atlantis, and the two return to Sophia's apartment. They discover that Kerner ransacked her office in search of Atlantean artifacts, but Sophia says that she keeps her most valuable item, her necklace, with her. She owns another of the shiny beads, now identified as the mystical metal orichalcum, and places it in the medallion's mouth, invoking the spirit of the Atlantean god Nur-Ab-Sal. She explains that a Nazi scientist called Dr. Hans Ubermann is searching for the power of Atlantis to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> energy source for warfare.|$|E

25|$|The Martian {{regolith}} {{is known}} to contain a maximum of 0.5% (w/v) perchlorate (ClO4−) that is toxic for most living organisms, but since they drastically lower the freezing point of water and few extremophiles can <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> energy source (see Perchlorates - Biology), it has prompted speculation of what their influence would be on habitability.|$|E
25|$|During the visit, Roh proclaimed {{he would}} not seek any more apologies from Japan over its colonial occupation, {{in the hope of}} {{maintaining}} a friendly relationship between the two countries. Although Roh's proclamation was made in good faith, some expressed concern that Japan may have interpreted this as the termination of its responsibility for the colonial past, and <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> excuse to deny any claims for compensation that may arise in the future.|$|E

25|$|Graf {{also had}} a {{powerful}} backhand drive but {{over the course of}} her career tended to use this less frequently, opting more often for an effective backhand slice. Starting in the early 1990s, she used the slice almost exclusively in baseline rallies and mostly limited the topspin backhand to passing shots. Her accuracy with the slice, both cross-court and down the line and her ability to skid the ball and keep it low, enabled her to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> offensive weapon to set the ball up for her forehand put-aways. However, Graf admitted in 1995 that she would have preferred having a two-handed backhand in retrospect.|$|E
25|$|Norway {{is part of}} the Schengen Area, an area {{comprising}} 26 European states that have eliminated border controls with other Schengen members and strengthened border controls with non-Schengen countries. When travelling within the Schengen Area, other valid identity documentation (such as a driving licence or EHIC card) is often sufficient. Norway is expected to start issuing national identity cards from 1 April 2018.

25|$|MLSE {{refused to}} sell Maple Leaf Gardens {{to anyone who}} {{proposed}} to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> arena in competition with the Air Canada Centre. Among these turned down was Eugene Melnyk, owner of the Toronto St. Michael's Majors OHL hockey team and the Maple Leafs' rival team, the Ottawa Senators. Various redevelopment schemes were proposed, most notably an entertainment complex containing retail shops and cinemas (similar to the redevelopment of the Montreal Forum), but these plans were abandoned when {{it was discovered that}} the tiered arena seating was holding up the exterior walls of the building, acting as a form of interior flying buttress. If the bowl of seating were removed, therefore, the exterior walls would lose most of their support.|$|E

On August 19, the artillery moved farther to the rear, except for C Battery, which remained in a creek bed north of Haman. Regimental engineers worked to improve a trail running from Haman northeast to the main Komam-ni-Masan road. The engineers intended to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> evacuation road for the artillery, if that became necessary, and to improve the road net of the regimental sector for better movement of troops and supplies.

500|$|French troops {{occupied}} the Greek island of Kastellorizo, off the southwest coast of Turkey, on 20 December 1916 to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> advance base against the Turks. Not pleased at {{the presence of}} the French, the Turks secretly deployed an artillery battery of four [...] and twelve [...] guns within range of the island. The French commander requested a seaplane carrier to conduct reconnaissance in the area and Ben-my-Chree was sent in response. She arrived on 11 January 1917 and anchored in the harbour which faced the mainland. The Turkish guns opened fire about two hours later, hitting the carrier with their third shot. Subsequent shells disabled her steering and started a fire in her hangar that spread across her upper deck.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{built in}} 1752 for Joseph Webb, the house {{remained}} in the family until around 1820 when it was sold to Martin Welles. It {{remained in the}} Welles family until 1913 when it was purchased {{by a group of}} businessmen who intended to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> athenaeum or a library, but a lack of funds saw its resale to Wallace Nutting. The house opened in 1916 as a part of Nutting's [...] "Chain of Colonial Picture Houses". Nutting sold the house to the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in 1919, who continue to operate it as a historic house museum. In 1996 and later in 2007, Nutting's murals and interpretive Colonial Revival elements were acknowledged and integrated with an exhibit showing his influence.|$|E

500|$|Fry's podgrams {{consist of}} anecdotes, {{such as how}} he broke his arm while filming a {{documentary}} in Brazil. He has also presented lectures, discussed certain themes in detail, or argued against things he sees as being wrong in today's society. In discussing his hatred of dancing, he said of music, [...] "I {{do not want to}} <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> exercise track for a farcical, meaningless, disgusting, brainless physical public exhibition of windmilling, gyrating and thrashing in a hot, loud room or hall." [...] The material is usually original for each podcast, but he may revisit topics that he has previously discussed. For example, one podgram consisted of a speech he had previously made concerning public service broadcasting. His apologetic explanation for the repeated subject matter described his busy life, and he stated that the podgram was [...] "all I can offer you." ...|$|E
500|$|Resources of graptolitic {{argillite}} in Estonia {{have been}} estimated at 60–70billion tonnes. Although resources of graptolitic argillite exceed that of kukersite, attempts to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> energy source have been unsuccessful {{due to its}} low calorific value and high sulfur content. [...] Its organic content ranges from 10 to 20% and its sulfur content from 2 to 4%. Correspondingly, its calorific value is only 5–8megajoules per kilogram (MJ/kg; 1,200–1,900kcal/kg) and its Fischer Assay oil yield is 3–5%. [...] However, the graptolitic argillite resource in Estonia contains a potential 2.1billion tonnes of oil. In addition, it contains 5.67million tonnes of uranium– {{making it one of}} the main potential sources of uranium in Europe– 16.53million tonnes of zinc, and 12.76million tonnes of molybdenum. There is as yet no economical and environmentally friendly technology to extract either the metals or the oil.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Alien: Isolation was divided but generally positive, with review scores ranging from IGN's 5.9 out of 10 to The Guardians 5 out of 5 stars. Josh Harmon of Electronic Gaming Monthly felt that Alien: Isolation [...] "succeeds as a genuine effort {{to capture the}} spirit of the film franchise in playable form, rather than a lazy attempt to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> easy backdrop for a cash-in with an ill-fitting genre." [...] Writing for GameSpot, Kevin VanOrd credited the game for its tense and frightening gameplay, stating that [...] "when all mechanics are working as intended, alien-evasion is dread distilled into its purest, simplest form." [...] However, he criticised the game's [...] "trial and error" [...] progression and frustrating distances between save points. Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer stated similar pros, but criticised the story and poor acting from the voice actors.|$|E
