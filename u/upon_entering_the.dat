5|$|<b>Upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> {{border town}} of Dryden, NY38 {{emerges from the}} valley and becomes Dryden–Harford Road as it heads northwestward through a more low-lying but still undeveloped area. The highway {{gradually}} curves to the north toward the village of Dryden, where the route changes names to South Street <b>upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> village limits. It continues north across Virgil Creek and past three blocks of homes to the commercial village center, where it intersects both NY13 and NY392. The latter begins here and heads off to the east while the former joins NY38 along North Street.|$|E

5|$|In November, rapidly {{weakening}} Tropical Cyclone Alison {{moved from}} the Australian basin and dissipated immediately <b>upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> south-west Indian Ocean on November13. On December4, short-lived Tropical Disturbance A3 was classified by MFR, subsequently drifting into the Australian region. Possibly related to the previous system, Tropical Cyclone Cathy {{moved from the}} Australian basin into the basin on December28, quickly dissipating.|$|E
5|$|Just {{across the}} county line, NY10 {{passes through the}} village of Ames, a small {{community}} situated south of Canajoharie Creek at the junction of NY10, CR88 and CR89. NY10 crosses over the creek shortly afterward and follows the waterway downhill. <b>Upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> village of Canajoharie, NY10 uses Reed Street, Walnut Street, and Rock Street which form a switchback to ease the descent before entering a valley containing the conjoined Mohawk River and Erie Canal and the New York State Thruway (I-90).|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed near Diego Garcia on April3 and subsequently moved westward, intensifying into a moderate tropical storm two days later. Given the name Kamisy, the storm gradually intensified into an intense tropical cyclone by April9. Kamisy reached winds of 170km/h (105mph) before making landfall in extreme northern Madagascar near Diego Suarez. It weakened <b>upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> Mozambique channel, but briefly re-intensified on April10. That day while passing near Mayotte, the cyclone {{turned to the}} southeast, striking Madagascar again near Majunga. Kamisy quickly crossed the country and quickly weakened into a {{tropical disturbance}}. After emerging into the Indian Ocean off {{the east coast of}} Madagascar, the system re-intensified into a moderate tropical storm before dissipating on April16.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 7. It tracked across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development due to strong wind shear. The wave then split into two, with the northern portion dissipating over Cuba on August 15 and the southern portion continuing westward. The wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 16. Deep convection increased over the wave <b>upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> Pacific, and early on August 19 it started to become better organized. After the development of a low-level circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on August 20 while located about 275miles (445km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the Caribbean Sea, the hurricane maintained a northwest trajectory. It passed south of Jamaica on July 1, where heavy rainfall flooded roads and railways. The hurricane crossed western Cuba on July 3. High winds {{on the island}} destroyed hundreds of houses, and the storm's rainfall damaged the tobacco crop. <b>Upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane turned {{to the west and}} attained peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) on July 5. It struck northeastern Mexico on July 8 and quickly dissipated. Upon its final landfall, the storm caused heavy damage in Mexico, and in southern Texas the storm ended a prolonged drought.|$|E

5|$|After peak intensity, Chapala {{skirted the}} Yemeni island of Socotra on 1November. Drier air and {{increased}} wind shear weakened the cyclone, although it maintained {{much of its}} intensity <b>upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Aden on 2November, becoming the strongest known cyclone in that body of water. After bypassing northern Somalia, Chapala weakened further {{and turned to the}} west-northwest. Early on 3November, the storm made landfall near Mukalla, Yemen, as a very severe cyclonic storm, making it the strongest storm on record to strike the nation. The storm dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|At the Singapore Airshow in February 2016, Airbus Group {{presented}} Air-Cobot {{and its use}} in {{its vision}} of the hangar of the future. The same month, the Singapore government enlisted Airbus Group to help local maintenance, repair, and operations providers to stay competitive against neighbour countries like Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines which are cheaper. To improve productivity, Airbus Group launches, in October 2016, a testbed hangar where new technologies can be tested. <b>Upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> hangar, cameras study the aircraft to detect damages. Mobile robots, {{such as the one}} of the Air-Cobot project, and drones, such as the one of the Aircam project, carry out more detailed inspections.|$|E
5|$|Cho was {{initially}} supposed to enroll at the Moscow University, {{but he was}} robbed at a train station in Omsk. With no money, Cho was stranded and had {{to work at a}} kolkhoz in Omsk for the summer to get some. The rector of the Omsk University, Aleksandr Sergeevitch Slivko was touched by his fate and decided to admit him in the university. Thus, from 1933 until his graduation in 1937, he attended the Faculty of Literature of the Gorky Omsk State Pedagogical University. Although he was not fluent in Russian <b>upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> university, he graduated with excellent marks, and his time spent there amplified his Russian and Soviet sides.|$|E

5|$|In his prime, Iginla was {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} NHL's most prominent power forwards. <b>Upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> league, he tried to emulate players like Brendan Shanahan and Keith Tkachuk, hoping to match their combination of finesse and physicality. He is one of the most consistent scorers in the league; between 1998 and 2008, only Jaromír Jágr scored more NHL goals than Iginla. Even so, scouting reports have argued that Iginla's lack of speed makes it easier for opponents to isolate him and restrict his ability to move if his teammates rely on him too much to lead the offence.|$|E
5|$|On October 29, 2014, Barea {{signed with}} the Dallas Mavericks, {{returning}} to the franchise for a second stint. In his first game back for Dallas the following day, Barea received a standing ovation from the American Airlines Center crowd <b>upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> game off the bench during the first quarter. He went on to record 4 points, 4 rebounds and 3 assists in the 120–102 win over the Utah Jazz. On February 11, 2015, Barea scored a season-high 22 points on 8-of-15 shooting in the 87-82 win over the Utah Jazz.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{continued}} to succeed <b>upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> NFL in 1950, winning the championship {{that year and}} reaching the title game in both 1951 and 1952. In January 1951, McBride testified in nationally televised hearings before the Kefauver Committee, where he was questioned about his Continental Press Service and alleged ties to organized crime and illegal gambling. It emerged that McBride partnered with Cleveland police captain John Fleming in real estate deals and had Fleming on the Yellow Cab payroll until 1941. McBride denied the mafia connections, claimed he never broke the law and was never charged with any crime. Congress later passed legislation making such wire services illegal.|$|E
5|$|The club, Thames Ironworks {{were the}} first ever winners of the West Ham Charity Cup in 1895 contested by clubs in the West Ham locality, then won the London League in 1897. They turned {{professional}} in 1898 <b>upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> Southern League Second Division, and were promoted to the First Division at the first attempt. The following year they came second from bottom, but had established themselves as a fully fledged competitive team. They comfortably fended off the challenge of local rivals Fulham in a relegation play-off, 5–1 in late April 1900 and retained their First Division status.|$|E
5|$|The route leaves South Granville, passing {{patches of}} trees and a smattering of homes as it heads toward the border village of Granville. Just south of the village limits, NY149 intersects with NY22. NY22 and NY149 briefly overlap before NY22 forks off to bypass Granville to the west. NY149 {{continues}} into Granville, becoming Quaker Street <b>upon</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> village limits. The route proceeds through the village to its center, where NY149 forks northeastward onto West Main Street and crosses over the Mettawee River.
