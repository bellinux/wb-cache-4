500|$|Heading {{into the}} 1000m final, Ohno {{had won the}} overall silver medal for the 1000m during the 2009–10 World Cup by {{competing}} {{in three of the}} four competitions during the season. [...] During the finals of the 1000m, Ohno finished in third place, making a comeback from a slip with less than three laps remaining. [...] With the bronze medal win, he became the most decorated American athlete ever at the Winter Games with seven career medals. [...] Bonnie Blair, the former record holder, said she was happy for his accomplishment, adding: [...] "It's a great feat for him, U.S. speedskating, and the United States of America. We hope that more kids will see his accomplishments and want to try our great sport that has been so good to us and taught <b>us</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about {{what it takes to be}} successful in life." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, a mid-credits scene teasing X-Men: Days of Future Past was {{attached}} to the theatrical release of The Wolverine. The scene, set two years after the events of The Wolverine, depicts Wolverine going through an airport security checkpoint while a commercial for Trask Industries plays in the background. Suddenly, Wolverine notices that all the metal objects around him start to shake and levitate. He turns around to see Magneto, who says he needs Wolverine's help to combat a threat to all mutants. When Wolverine asks Magneto why he should trust him, the people around them freeze as Xavier approaches Wolverine and assures him that Magneto is telling the truth. Adam Pockross of Yahoo! Movies described the mid-credits scene as the coolest part of The Wolverine and wrote, [...] "Boom! And that's how you tease the next film: by giving <b>us</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to chew on, yet so few answers".|$|E

2500|$|Our debut was at {{a fashion}} show at the [...] "Disco Airport" [...] (Discothèque), which was close to where we practiced in Buenos Aires. Nobody gave <b>us</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as a nod. The three of us played on a very {{deficient}} sound system. But we were happy, even though no one paid attention. We really looked like a punk group, we didn't {{know how to play}} and the sound was loud, even though it was just that.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Claire’s open {{disdain for}} her sister, {{she has never}} told Agnes about Tobias’s affair. It is not clear if she does this out of love or out of spite. She keeps the affair a secret, {{almost as if she}} has a hidden weapon that she protects in case she may have to use it one day. When Agnes comes right out and asks Claire to confirm her suspicions about Tobias, Claire’s answer is, “Ya got me, Sis.” Shortly after this exchange, Agnes {{describes}} Claire in this way: “Claire could tell <b>us</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> if she cared to [...] [...] [...] Claire, who watches from the sidelines, has seen so very much, has seen us all so clearly [...] [...] [...] You were not named for nothing.” Claire is said to closely resemble Albee’s aunt Jane, an alcoholic and frequent visitor to the Albee home.|$|E
2500|$|On April 6, 1986, Engine 819 {{moved out}} of the Cotton Belt Route's yard at Pine Bluff marking the first time it had moved under its own power since 1953. The large crowd {{gathered}} at the railyard, including a number of railroad employees, burst into applause and shouted their approval as the locomotive's nose emerged from the shop building and into the bright sunshine. The American flag and the Arkansas state flag affixed to the right and left sides of the shiny black engine gave a patriotic air to the event. Members of the Cotton Belt Railroad Historical Society invested over 35,000 man-hours into this restoration project. Jake Commer praised the efforts the Cotton Belt Route had extended stating, [...] "They helped <b>us</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> I can't even begin to tell you about all of it. If it hadn't been for the railroad, we couldn't have done it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1989 Compute! {{stated that}} the 1990 edition's multipolar {{features}} were welcome additions to the game. That year Card {{stated that the}} magazine's 1988 list caused him to reevaluate the game when playing the 1990 edition, stating that it had [...] "the most detailed, carefully extrapolated future world I've worked with". While still criticizing geopolitical [...] "absurdities" [...] such as forcing the United States to passively accept Soviet troops in Syria (contrary to {{what happened during the}} Yom Kippur War) and advisors in Mexico or start nuclear war, Card now concluded that such outcomes probably reflected computer limitations rather than Crawford's political views. He advised players to pretend that Balance of Power was set on an alien planet [...] "astonishingly similar" [...] to Earth, and to play solely based on the game's assumptions about the world. Chuck Moss disagreed with Card's revised view, describing Balance of Power in Computer Gaming World in 1992 as [...] "reflect extreme bias on the part of [...] designers". He called it a [...] "pacific treatise ... nuclear war erupted if the <b>U.S.</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as sent five million dollars to Panama".|$|E
2500|$|According to tradition, Philemon did free Onesimus, {{and both}} were {{eventually}} recognized as saints by the Church. T. David Curp asserts that, [...] "Given that the Church received Philemon as inspired Scripture, Paul's ambiguity effectively blocked the early Fathers of the Church from denouncing slavery outright." [...] As an example, Curp points out that St. John Chrysostom, in his sermon on Philemon, considers Paul's sending Onesimus back to his master a sign that slavery should not be abolished. However, in his Homilies on Philemon, Chrysostom actually opposes unfair and unjust forms of slavery by stating that those who own slaves are to passionately love their slaves with the very Love of Christ for humanity: [...] "this ... is the glory of a Master, to have grateful slaves. And this is the glory of a Master, that He should thus love His slaves ... Let us therefore be stricken with awe at this so great love of Christ. Let us be inflamed with this love-potion. Though a man be low and mean, yet if we hear that he loves us, we are above all things warmed with love towards him, and honor him exceedingly. And do we then love? And when our Master loves <b>us</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> we are not excited?".|$|E
