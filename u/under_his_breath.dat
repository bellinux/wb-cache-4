500|$|The two lead counsel clashed {{again during}} their final {{addresses}} to the jury, with Pepler objecting to Diefenbaker's use of testimony from the preliminary hearing. Justice McFarlane stated to Pepler, [...] "I {{do not think}} you should object like this", and when Pepler persisted, the judge [...] "roared" [...] at him, [...] "Please, just stop this." [...] Diefenbaker stated, [...] "I sat and suffered while my learned friend misconstrued the evidence" [...] and when he noticed Pepler muttering <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> said to him, [...] "You are growling", to which Pepler replied, [...] "Yes I am growling. I am objecting too." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Ruiz {{spent the}} entire season with the Double-A Reading Phillies, posting a [...]284 batting average and hitting 17 home runs, the latter of which was second among {{catchers}} in the Eastern League. In addition to his strong offensive numbers, he threw out 25 of 76 attempted base stealers (32.9%). Off the field, it was in 2004 that Ruiz first gained the original form of his nickname [...] "Chooch". [...] Though a quiet individual, Ruiz frequently muttered [...] "chucha" [...] (a word equivalent to the f-bomb in Panama) <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> and teammate Anderson Machado thus began to address Ruiz as [...] "chucha", which was later shortened to [...] "Chooch", and the nickname's usage snowballed from there. His strong performance earned him another promotion in 2005 when he played for the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, and posted a better batting average but fewer home runs than in Reading: [...]300, 4 home runs, 40 RBIs in 100 games. Before the 2006 season, he played for his native Panama in the first World Baseball Classic. His final season {{in the minor leagues}} was 2006. During 100 games, he hit [...]307 with 16 home runs and 69 RBIs, earning International League all-star accolades. He moved back and forth between Triple-A and the major league Phillies all year long, making his MLB debut on May 6, 2006.|$|E
2500|$|... "After he had {{glanced at}} their {{copy of the}} fourteen-part message, Hull's anger burst forth. 'In all my fifty years of public service,' he told the {{astonished}} diplomats, 'I have {{never seen such a}} document that was more crowded with infamous falsehood and distortion.' Nomura and Kurusu, who had not been told of the attack, bowed themselves out in an embarrassed fluster. A department official overheard Hull muttering <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> as the door closed, 'Scoundrels and piss-ants.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The narrator remains unsuspected, {{though he}} {{occasionally}} reassures himself by repeating <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> [...] "I am safe". One day, {{he notes that}} he will remain safe only {{if he is not}} foolish enough to openly confess. In saying so, however, he begins to question if he is capable of confessing. He fearfully runs through the streets, arousing suspicion. When finally stopped, he feels struck by some [...] "invisible fiend". He reveals his secret with [...] "distinct enunciation", though in such a hurry as if afraid of being interrupted. He is quickly tried and convicted of murder and sentenced to death by hanging.|$|E
2500|$|His father Louis Ginsberg was a {{published}} poet {{and a high}} school teacher. Ginsberg's mother, Naomi Livergant Ginsberg, was affected by a psychological illness that was never properly diagnosed. She was also {{an active member of}} the Communist Party and took Ginsberg and his brother Eugene to party meetings. Ginsberg later said that his mother [...] "made up bedtime stories that all went something like: 'The good king rode forth from his castle, saw the suffering workers and healed them.'" [...] Of his father Ginsberg said [...] "My father would go around the house either reciting Emily Dickinson and Longfellow <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> or attacking T. S. Eliot for ruining poetry with his 'obscurantism.' I grew suspicious of both sides." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....while talking or even musing {{as he sat}} in his chair, he {{commonly}} held {{his head to one side}} towards his right shoulder, and shook it in a tremulous manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his mouth; sometimes giving a half whistle, sometimes making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking like a hen, and sometimes protruding it against his upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> 'Too, too, too.' All this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, in the course of a dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale.|$|E

60|$|Huck {{felt that}} a silence was going to ensue--a thing still more awful than any amount of murderous talk; so he held <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> and stepped gingerly back; planted his foot {{carefully}} and firmly, after balancing, one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first {{on one side and}} then on the other. He took another step back, with the same elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and--a twig snapped <b>under</b> <b>his</b> foot! <b>His</b> <b>breath</b> stopped and he listened. There was no sound--the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes--turned himself as carefully {{as if he were a}} ship--and then stepped quickly but cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and so he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he reached the Welshman's. He banged at the door, and presently the heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.|$|R
60|$|Somehow {{he hit the}} ties; {{perhaps by}} {{subconscious}} judgment, and perhaps by good luck. Then he felt loose gravel <b>under</b> <b>his</b> feet and thrilled with a strange fierce satisfaction. <b>His</b> <b>breath</b> was labored and his body wet by sweat, but the moving beam had not reached the lamp. He {{was going to make}} it.|$|R
2500|$|The group's July 1995 album, The Soft 'n' Sexy Sound, was {{produced}} by Victor Van Vugt. It reached the Top40 and earned Graney the 'Best Male Artist' accolade at the ARIA Music Awards of 1996. In his acceptance speech, Graney wore a hot pink, crushed velvet suit and a wig to declare himself (<b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath)</b> 'King of Pop'. This was {{a reference to a}} 1970s [...] which was presented by teen magazine, Go-Set. The album also received nominations as 'Best Cover Art' for Mahony and 'Producer of the Year' for Victor Vaughan [...] [...] "I'm not Afraid to Be Heavy" [...] (June), [...] "Rock 'n' Roll Is Where I Hide" [...] (August) and [...] "I'm Gonna Live in My Own Big World" [...] (February 1996) were issued as singles.

It was also accompanied by a media CD with an interview of Graney by HG Nelson called A Word in Yer Shell, Like. It was released in the UK and Europe on the This Way Up label in 1996. Graney and Moore spent 6 months of the year recording and working in London.|$|E

60|$|Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, {{looking down}} from the top of a tall tree, held their breath.

60|$|The {{track was}} rough and fresh gravel rolled <b>under</b> <b>his</b> feet. Now {{and then he}} struck a {{cross-tie}} and nearly fell.

He did not know where the train was, only that it was near. The woods throbbed with a savage din; the big cars, loaded with rattling gravel, clanged and roared as they plunged down grade.|$|R
