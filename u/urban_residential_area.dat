500|$|The main campus, {{also known}} as the east campus, is about [...] in an <b>urban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>area</b> of {{downtown}} Greenville. The 158 buildings on main campus comprise more than 4.6million square feet (325,000m²) of academic, research, and residential space. Many of the Main Campus buildings feature the Spanish–Mission style architecture; inspiration drawn from Thomas Jarvis' time as an ambassador to Brazil. He wanted to bring the unique architecture to eastern North Carolina. On the main campus, there are five districts: Campus Core, Downtown District, Warehouse District, Athletic fields and the South Academic District. On the Campus Core, there are 15residence halls which are divided into three separate neighborhoods. The distinct feature of the main campus is the mall, which is a large tree–laden grassy area where many students go to relax. In the middle of the mall is the replica of the cupola on the original Austin building.|$|E

From the perspective of art, {{landscape design}}ers should give full consideration to the formal beauty which includes the conception of the work, space, drawing, color, etc. Works should make people feel their beauty in sight, hearing, touch, smell, etc. But only pursuing {{the beauty of the}} form is not enough, landscape design is the comprehensive science and artistic subject. Ignoring the function and only pursuing the formal beauty are the common problems in the works of landscape design. When dealing with the landscape design, designers must take the combination of residents, outdoor activities, environment and art into consideration according to the requirements of the landscape design for <b>urban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas.</b> The purpose of the landscape design for <b>urban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> is to construct an open area in the external space of buildings and make it harmonize with the city, buildings, people and people's life...|$|R

This paper analyzes the design requirements of the children's recreational site and studies the site design elements.

Its purpose is to create a safe, comfortable, entertaining and educational outdoor activity space for children. Improving the quality of the space environment not only benefits children's health but also helps develop children's creative thinking and adapt to the complex society. Whether children's outdoor recreational site design is good or not depends on whetther designers can crouch down to know the world through children's perspective. In this way, it can meet the children's growth, emotion, behavioral habits and mental development, and many other needs.

40|$|Abstract. Outdoor {{activity}} spaces {{become more}} and more important as the size of <b>urban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> keeps growing due to quickened urbanization. Urban parks and open spaces are major places for residents nearby to enjoy physical exercises and leisure activities. Landscape planners nowadays confront a prominent task as how to create quality activity spaces in <b>urban</b> parks neighboring <b>residential</b> <b>areas.</b> In this paper, part of the Yuan Dynasty City Wall Relics Park next to Guodian Huayuan, a typical <b>residential</b> <b>area</b> in Beijing, is chosen as the object of study for on-spot survey based on theories and methods of environment-behavior studies. Users, periods, behaviors are categorized and activities of such users during different periods are recorded in details by means of counting, photographing and dotting. With such data, in-depth analysis is conducted as how the place is used and what are the spatial identities so as to render reference material for designing activity spaces in <b>urban</b> parks neighboring <b>residential</b> <b>areas.</b> Background and objectives A huge population in China gives rise to restricted spaces for residence, particularly limited places for outdoor activities in <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> in cities with a high population density. Therefore, open spaces in <b>urban</b> parks neighboring <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> become a major place for outdoor activities. Such space...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} {{reported in}} this paper addresses the relationship between quality of open space and health related lifestyle in <b>urban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas.</b> The research was performed in the residential developments in Ljubljana, Slovenia, dating {{from the time of}} political and economic changes in the early nineties. Compared to the older neighborhoods, these are typically single-use <b>residential</b> <b>areas,</b> with small open spaces and poor landscape design. The research is concerned with {{the quality of life in}} these areas, especially from the perspective of the vulnerable users, like the elderly and children. Both depend on easily accessible green areas in close proximity to their homes. The hypothesis is that the poor open space quality affects their health-related behavior and their perceived health status. The research has three methodological phases: (1) a comparison between <b>urban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> by criteria describing their physical characteristics; (2) behavior observation and mapping and (3) a resident opinion survey. The results confirm differences between open spaces of the selected <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> as well as their relation with outdoor activities: a lack of outdoor programs correlates with poor variety of outdoor activities, limited to transition type, less time spent outdoors and lower satisfaction with their home environment.

US 1 crosses Gwynns Falls and expands to a divided highway before passing the Deck of Cards rowhouses between Brunswick Street and Millington Avenue.

US 1 meets the eastern terminus of MD 144 at another one-way pair, Pratt Street and Lombard Street.

At Edmondson Avenue, Fulton Avenue becomes two-way; however, southbound US 1 remains on Monroe Street. Shortly after passing over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, US 1 reaches North Avenue. The Fulton Avenue/Monroe Street one-way pair continues north as MD 140, while both directions of US 1 turn east onto North Avenue.|$|E
