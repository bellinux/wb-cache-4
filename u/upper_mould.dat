5000|$|For many {{moulding}} methods, it {{is convenient}} {{to refer to}} one mould piece as a [...] "lower" [...] mould and another mould piece as an [...] "upper" [...] mould. Lower and upper refer to the different faces of the moulded panel, not the mould's configuration in space. In this convention, {{there is always a}} lower mould, and sometimes an <b>upper</b> <b>mould.</b> Part construction begins by applying materials to the lower mould. Lower mould and <b>upper</b> <b>mould</b> are more generalized descriptors than more common and specific terms such as male side, female side, a-side, b-side, tool side, bowl, hat, mandrel, etc. Continuous manufacturing uses a different nomenclature.|$|E

On the lower side is a rigid mould and on the upper side is a flexible membrane made from silicone or an extruded polymer film such as nylon. Reinforcement materials can be placed manually or robotically. They include continuous fibre forms fashioned into textile constructions. Most often, they are pre-impregnated with the resin {{in the form of}} prepreg fabrics or unidirectional tapes. In some instances, a resin film is placed upon the lower mould and dry reinforcement is placed above. The <b>upper</b> <b>mould</b> is installed and vacuum is applied to the mould cavity. The assembly is placed into an autoclave. This process is generally performed at both elevated pressure and elevated temperature. The use of elevated pressure facilitates a high fibre volume fraction and low void content for maximum structural efficiency.|$|E

50|$|The coping {{line of the}} parapet {{walls to}} the side and rear facades of the {{extension}} has been matched to an <b>upper</b> <b>moulding</b> line on the front section of the building. While a rendered plinth line has been created on these facades, its level does not match that of the front section. Its width diminishes over the gentle slope from East Lane to Bolsover Street. Rendered strips mark each line established by the heads and sills of the windows in these facades. The extent of render modelling has been greatly parred down, compared to the building's front section. Each of the long side facades- one addressing Market Lane and the other a paved and treed avenue- has three gated entry points. The first set is located adjacent to the front section of the building, while the other two sets divide the remaining facade areas evenly. On each facade, these two openings are framed by rendered pilasters and topped by a triangular rise in the parapet. A number of double-hung sash windows are set in the walls between the various entries. On the rear facade, in the northern corner, there is a double door accessed via a short flight of metal stairs and overhung by a small metal shade roof. There are also four louvred windows with high sill levels.|$|R

Uneven SEN port clogging was found to have a great effect on the mould fluid flow and thus mould slag entrainment. A new SEN with double tapered ports was designed to overcome SEN port clogging and erosion. Plant trial results showed that a decrease in the buildup rate in the bore of the SEN immediately above and in the ports can be achieved using the new SEN design.

40|$|The Resin Infusion process (RI, {{also known}} as VARTM) is a {{subclass}} of the Liquid Composite Moulding (LCM) collective, which is increasingly applied in industry. As opposed to the other LCM processes, RI utilises only one rigid mould half, the <b>upper</b> <b>mould</b> half of the mould being a flexible plastic bag. This greatly reduces tooling costs, and makes the process suitable for medium to very large sized parts. However, the interaction between a flexible bag and the infusion of the laminate within, presents a significant challenge to model and understand. The University of Auckland LCM research group is developing SimLCM as a generic LCM mould filling simulation. SimLCM has recently been extended to simulate RI, focusing on resin flow and laminate thickness predictions throughout the process. To accurately predict filling times, {{and the evolution of}} fluid pressure and laminate thickness during filling and post-filling phases, a detailed knowledge is required of the complex compaction response of the fibre reinforcement. While significant research has been published on modelling of the filling in RI, the post-filling period has received much less attention. This phase is, however, significant as spatial variations in laminate thickness are removed, preferably before the infused resin gels. Extending on previous work on rectilinear filling, this paper will present a program of RI experiments in a range of 2 D flow geometries and the results will be compared to the predictions made using SimLCM. Special attention is given to the post-filling stage, and the validation of the new models developed for SimLCM. A selection of radial, peripheral and more complex filling situations have been addressed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of industrial {{products in the}} fields of traffic technology, mechanical engineering, etc. requires higher efficiency of materials and structures. Thus, lightweight design has become very important, mainly for reducing the effects of accelerated mass. New materials like high-performance fiber composites not only find application in aerospace technology, but are also gaining importance in terrestrial areas. Considering the excellent properties of weight, Carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) offer a variety of advantages in comparison with usual materials like steel, titan, or aluminum. On the other hand there are problems concerning the vibrational sensitivity due to low mass, tendency to buckling, and susceptibility to damage. A promising way to solve these problems is the integration of multifunctional materials such as piezoelectrics, Shape Memory Alloys (SMA), etc. Arising deformations, accelerations, or other physical measurements can be detected by sensors, technically processed, and eliminated with suitable real-time controlled actuators. To handle multifunctional material in different applications statements regarding the compatibility, the degree of efficiency and the overall electromechanical behavior of the material are important. Composite materials offer the unique chance to integrate multifunctional elements during the manufacturing process. The multifunctional elements {{become a part of the}} material itself. Besides the load-carrying function the integration of sensors and actuators within the composites forms a material which is able to detect and specifically influence its own loads, vibrations, or deformations. Because of some excellent properties (low energy consumption in quasi static applications, high efficiency, fast response, etc.) piezoelectric materials are in the center of interest. Usually thin monolithic piezoceramic wafers are used as structural actuators for active composites. To improve the mechanical and electrical performance it is often advantageous to pre-encapsulate the piezoceramic (e. g. in a polymer matrix). With this additional step the piezoceramic can be provided with a mechanical pre-compression, electrical insulation and mechanical stabilization. More recently active composites with piezoceramic fibers came into focus. These fibers (Æ 10 - 30 µm) are processed in form of patches with uniaxially aligned piezoceramic fibers embedded in a polymer matrix excited by interdigitated surface electrodes. With the use of the longitudinal piezoelectric effect and their excellent suitability for integration in curved structures piezoceramic fibers offer a number of advantages. Unfortunately these fibers are not yet available on a large scale. As there has been extensive work in the field of integration of thin lead zirconate-titanate piezo-ceramic (PZT) wafers (50 x 30 x 0. 2 mm) into CFRP at the Institute of Structural Mechanics, DLR-Braunschweig, this will be focused on in the following. Provided with uniformly electroded surfaces these wafers operating in the lateral, d 31, mode. Fig. 1 shows the principle design of some active composites. In Fig. 1 a the ceramic wafer is embedded between thin non-conductive fiber material (e. g. glass- or polyester fiber) which serve asinsulation. The load carrying CFRP-layers above and below the ceramic are used to electrically contact the piezoceramic, therefore the insulation layers are required to avoid short circuits. As the usual disturbing wires are not needed, the manufacture of the active composite has become easier and there is no additional weakening of the structure. In case of a break the piezoceramic will still work, as the broken pieces stay in the electrical field where they can be controlled. The tube in fig 1. b has the same lay-up with piezoceramic elements in each side of the tube. This structure is able to compensate deformations under thermal loads. In structures with arbitrary distributed ceramics carbon fiber bundles are used as a structural conformable way to contact the piezoceramic. Fig 1. c shows a beam structure with two piezo-ceramics. Each electrode in the active beam is contacted separately. In this way it can be used as strain actuator as well as a bimorph. Fig. 2 shows the operating diagram of the beam structure for both cases. Significant differences between mechanical and thermal properties of the ceramic plates as well as the extreme brittleness of the piezoceramic material demand sophisticated manufacturing techniques. Several manufacturing techniques have been used at the DLR including hand-lay-up and filament winding technique. Very good experience has been made with a sophisticated RTM technology, the so-called DP-RTM (Differential Pressure  Resin Transfer Moulding). This guarantees an extreme high quality and reproducibility of the components. The fiber material is laid out in dry state which facilitates the positioning of the electric cables and ceramics. The DP-RTM procedure becomes especially interesting as it is not necessary to provide massive moulds since the clamping forces in the autoclave are created by the differential pressure. Thus, a simple sheet plate can serve as sub mould while a vacuum foil is applied for the <b>upper</b> <b>mould.</b> Fiber volume content and fluid rate can directly be controlled by adjusting differential pressure during the stages of injection. In order to minimize the weight of the active fiber composite a high fiber volume content is required. This can be achieved by increasing the differential pressure. Simultaneously, the increasing mechanical load on the ceramics has to be considered since it might result in mechanical damage of the brittle actuators. The different process parameters like autoclave pressure, autoclave temperature and differential pressure have been optimized during several test procedures. The new materials and material systems that can be used as multifunctional actuators and sensors with new real-time control concepts and adaptive signal processing, have helped to establish a new class of structures called adaptive structures. The results of recent investigations indicate that these concepts contain very promising potentials for future structural and acoustic purposes. With the research progress and the realization of functional demonstrators as described above by some examples, the intention is now to make this technology available for common industrial applications. To achieve this aim an inter-disciplinary development process (fig. 3) has been established. LEITPROJEKT ADAPTRONIK is the title of a German national model project that will be conducted under the auspices of the Braunschweig-based Institute of Structural Mechanics. A consortium of seven major industry partners comprising five branches and seven medium and small-sized companies as well as further research partners was established as a center for the development of technologies within the model project. Besides many other research topics, the integration and development of piezoceramic plates and new piezoceramic fibers are of major importance within this project...|$|E

500|$|The {{bodywork}} {{was made}} from two injection-moulded polypropylene shells supplied by three manufacturers; J.J.

According to Rodney Dale, the <b>upper</b> shell <b>mould</b> was [...] "one of the largest – if not the largest – injection mouldings of its type in the UK: possibly even in the world". The manufacturing process reflected Sinclair's ambition for the C5 production line. A single mould set was capable of producing up to 4,000 parts every week. The {{two parts of the}} shell were joined together by wrapping a tape around the joint, aligning them on a jig, pressing them together and passing an electric current through the tape to heat and melt it. The same process was used to make the front and rear bumper assemblies of the Austin Maestro and only took about 70 seconds to complete. Although Sinclair had considered producing the C5 at the DeLorean plant at Dunmurry in Northern Ireland, which had one of Europe's most advanced automated plastic-body manufacturing facilities, this was not to be, as the DeLorean Motor Company failed in a controversial bankruptcy that resulted in the plant's closure.|$|R

40|$|Continuous-fibre-reinforced {{thermoplastic}} composites {{are increasingly}} used in demanding applications in, for example, the aerospace industry. The use of specialty thermoplastics such as polyetherimide (PEI), polyphenylenesulfide (PPS) and polyether-etherketone (PEEK) reinforced with glass, carbon or aramid fibres results in solvent and corrosion resistant products with high specific stiffness and high melting temperature. These composites can be moulded into complicated shapes with the rubber pressing process where a relatively hot laminate is shortly pressed between a cold rubber mould {{and a cold}} steel tool. The process is fast compared to the forming of thermosetting polymer matrix composites where extensive curing times are involved.

40|$|Since 2005 {{scientist}} Professor Tony Ryan, University of Sheffield, {{and artist}} and designer Professor Helen Storey, London College of Fashion, {{have worked together}} to create real solutions for a more sustainable world. Wonderland is a powerful and collaborative project of shared ideas, symbolic of change, {{it began with a}} provocative question posed by Helen to scientist Tony Ryan. The Disappearing Dresses were the result of a process that started when Helen began talking to Tony, a polymer chemist. Using the symbols of the dissolving dress and other works that have arisen {{as a result of the}} collaboration, Wonderland shines light on the wider and much greater issues of sustainability and ethical living. A work perhaps vulnerable to cynicism, it demands and suggests intelligent change through brave collaboration and experiment. The Wonderland exhibition brought together the worlds of art and science. By working together, Ryan and Storey have been able to use their different backgrounds to spark new ideas on the application of science and discover practical solutions to current ethical issues. The Original tour: The project developed a number of products, in varying stages of completion. The exhibitions in Sheffield demonstrated two of these: Dissolving bottles The dissolving bottles, shown at the city’s Botanical Gardens, are an exploration of intelligent packaging. Once finished with, the bottles dissolve under hot water to form a gel in which seeds can be grown. The concept could revolutionise the packaging industry and aims to highlight issues surrounding waste plastic. Disappearing dresses The disappearing dresses, displayed at Meadowhall Shopping Centre, are made from dissolving textiles designed Trish Belford at Interface, at the University of Ulster. The material dissolves in water, creating vibrant underwater fireworks. The dresses will be hung from scaffolds and gradually lowered into giant goldfish bowls of water. The exhibition questions the environmental sustainability of our current fashion industry and what happens to used clothing. To date three new and potentially globally important concepts have evolved out of the collaboration between Helen Storey and Tony Ryan. These were exhibited as part of the Wonderland exhibition. In the simplest terms these are: The disappearing bottle - inspired by Helen's original concept of a plastic bottle that would have an intelligent relationship with its contents. Water purification products: In the third world the most readily available source of power is human muscle. The water purification products use reverse osmosis and human energy to create clean from contaminated water. Free Feet: This is a 'second skin' for the underside of the foot; a running shoe with no <b>uppers.</b> It is <b>moulded</b> from a polymer and has adhesive patches at the heel, ball of foot and big-toe. The commercial potential is four-fold (1) medical device for people with sensitive and swollen feet who cannot wear conventional shoes (2) orthopedic device to encourage good posture through effectively walking barefoot (3) foot protection for people who normally do not wear shoes and suffer from skin damage and infection as a result (4) fashion. This product is being developed in collaboration with Terraplana Ltd. This unique exhibition was first shown in 2008 - 2009 in a showcase of talent, imagination and creativity. It toured from London, to a city-wide event in Sheffield and then to Belfast. Tony and Helen comment: "We know that if we continue to live the way we are now, the earth will become uninhabitable. Yet, we still struggle with the enormity of the thought and so, as often as with war, it becomes something reported to us in our everyday lives, staining our hearts whilst frustrating our minds. Experience shows our enormous potential to think the unimaginable is increased most profoundly in collaboration. We deliberately collided our differently trained minds to specifically address some of the planet's greatest problems - lack of drinking water and non-recyclable plastics. This collision produced a new water purification device and the disappearing plastic bottle amongst other ideas. We chose dress to manifest our new approach because we wanted to create something beautifully familiar with which to stimulate an emotional connection, particularly here at LCF. To watch a dress, that has taken months to create, disappear in a few days seemed to connect directly to that place of unfathomable loss. We hope this may work as a metaphor for our disappearing world. " Nick Knight and SHOWstudio worked with Helen and Tony to create films and a series of images.
