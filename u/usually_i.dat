500|$|Talulah Riley as a {{woman whom}} Eames disguises himself as in a dream. Riley liked the role, despite it being minimal: [...] "I get to wear a nice dress, pick up men in bars, and shove them in elevators. It was good to do {{something}} adultish. <b>Usually</b> <b>I</b> play 15-year-old English schoolgirls." ...|$|E
500|$|Series co-star Robert Patrick had issues remembering and {{delivering}} his lines {{due to the}} theme of demonic possession, which reportedly [...] "was freaking" [...] him out. He later explained, [...] "It {{was the first time that}} I couldn't do my lines. <b>Usually</b> <b>I</b> would show up, and they'd always put the camera on me first [...] I couldn't do it." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Anthony Mandler, and shot on an indoor soundstage in Castaic, California on April 23, 2008. The concept for the video was [...] "high-end erotica". In an interview with James Montgomery for MTV News whilst on set of the music video, Levine provided a summary of what the video would entail, saying: [...] "It's this kind of ultra-glamorous, photography-based, late-'70s/ early-'80s situation. It's really stylish and really beautiful... It's the most choreographed thing I've ever done, because <b>usually</b> <b>I</b> just {{get up there and}} screw around. But with Rihanna, it's completely different and so cool." [...] In response, Rihanna continued to say that [...] "I don't do a lot of videos where I have so much chemistry with the other artist, and this is only my second duet in a video... It's really intense, because you have to work with each other so much. It's new for me, but I'm enjoying it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> {{find that}} <b>I</b> {{have a good}} deal less than I had in the beginning. Are you troubled in the {{peculiar}} way you mention?" ...|$|R

500|$|Clarkson shares writing credits on {{all five}} {{original}} songs on Wrapped in Red, {{some of which}} were written in December 2012 to avoid writing Christmas tunes during the 2013 summer season. She co-wrote the opening and title track, [...] "Wrapped in Red", with Ashley Arrison, Aben Eubanks, and Shane McAnally. A Christmas ballad, the song was inspired by a scene in the holiday feature film Love Actually (2003), in which someone confesses unrequited love towards another. Critics singled out the track the one that resonates the Wall of Sound the most. The second track, [...] "Underneath the Tree", was written by Clarkson and Kurstin, making it the first time they had co-written a track together. Clarkson remarked: [...] "Greg and I have worked a lot together, but <b>usually</b> <b>I</b> just come in and I just sing. We've never have actually written a song together at this point. And he and I were like, 'Let's just try to write something for the record." [...] RCA Records chief executive Peter Edge remarked that its release as a single was partly inspired by the success of [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] by Mariah Carey. The following track is a rendition of the holiday standard [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", which Clarkson had selected for its saccharine content.|$|E
500|$|In May 2012, Love debuted an art {{collection}} at Fred Torres Collaborations in New York titled [...] "And She's Not Even Pretty", which contained over forty drawings and paintings by Love composed in ink, colored pencil, pastels, and watercolors. Later in the year, she collaborated with Michael Stipe {{on the track}} [...] "Rio Grande" [...] for Johnny Depp's sea shanty album , and in 2013, co-wrote and contributed vocals on [...] "Rat A Tat" [...] from Fall Out Boy's album Save Rock and Roll; she also appeared in the music video for the track. After solo performances in December 2012 and January 2013, Love appeared in advertisements for Yves Saint Laurent alongside Kim Gordon and Ariel Pink. Love completed a solo tour of North America in mid-2013, which was purported to be in promotion of an upcoming solo album; however, it was ultimately dubbed a [...] "greatest hits" [...] tour, and featured songs from Love's and Hole's back catalogue. Love told Billboard {{at the time that}} she had recorded eight songs in the studio. [...] " [...] are not my usual (style)", Love said. [...] "I don't have any Fleetwood Mac references on it. <b>Usually</b> <b>I</b> always have a Fleetwood Mac reference as well as having, like, Big Black references. These are very unique songs that sort of magically happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Professor Goodman {{describes}} him, Karl Terzaghi was {{a remarkable}} man and an impassioned engineer. As he put it himself, “All the modest achievements which I have to my credit can be described by a simple formula… Guided by common sense and casual observations, I recognized weak points in traditional procedures {{and tried to make}} them less weak. Sometimes I failed, but <b>usually</b> <b>I</b> succeeded.” ...|$|E
60|$|I replied, as <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> did {{whenever}} <b>I</b> had a chance, {{that nobody}} had ever loved anybody else as I loved Dora. Traddles came to my assistance with a confirmatory murmur.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sir,' {{replied the}} wit, 'you're very welcome, I'm sure. The honour is reciprocal, sir, as <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> say when <b>I</b> dramatise a book. Did {{you ever hear}} a {{definition}} of fame, sir?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Gqiba's no-nonsense {{approach}} to his position {{was often the}} subject of press coverage, including his admission that he was never trained as a diplomat, stating that [...] "I'm a military man and <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> say what <b>I</b> think." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a 1976 Rolling Stone interview, Young {{gives an}} insight into working with the Vanda/Young team: After I {{recorded}} Pasadena our relationship just developed. [...] They play me their songs and say: [...] "See {{what you think of}} this." [...] <b>Usually</b> <b>I</b> like it, sometimes I don't. [...] Sometimes I pick out something they've written and say [...] "I want to do this", like I did with Things to do. (For the JPY album), we worked out some of the songs on the road. [...] Others are worked out in the studio and some, like Standing in the Rain are produced by the studio system. [...] Harry and George work it out and I come in later to do the vocal.|$|E
2500|$|Encouraged by her father, Bow {{continued}} to visit studio agencies asking for parts. [...] "But {{there was always}} something. I was too young, or too little, or too fat. <b>Usually</b> <b>I</b> was too fat." [...] Eventually, director Elmer Clifton needed a tomboy for his movie Down to the Sea in Ships, saw Bow in Motion Picture Classic magazine, and sent for her. In an attempt to overcome her youthful looks, Bow put her hair up and arrived in a dress she [...] "sneaked" [...] from her mother. Clifton said she was too old, but broke into laughter as the stammering Bow made him believe she was {{the girl in the}} magazine. Clifton decided to bring Bow with him and offered her $35 a week. Bow held out for $50 and Clifton agreed, but he could not say whether she would [...] "fit the part". Bow later learned that one of Brewsters' subeditors had urged Clifton to give her a chance.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Bless the child! why didn't {{she come}} and call? I'd have let her in; though <b>usually</b> <b>I</b> avoid stage-struck girls as I do reporters,' laughed Miss Cameron.|$|E

6000|$|... ‘I made,’ he said, {{turning the}} leaves: ‘I made a guiding {{memorandum}} or so—as <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> do, for <b>I</b> have no conversational powers whatever—to which I will, with your permission, my dear, refer. “Well and happy.” Truly. You are well and happy, my dear? You look so.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. I suppose I {{did all the}} jawing--I <b>usually</b> do. <b>I</b> think I {{was telling}} her about the strike, and how the women took it." ...|$|R
6000|$|He sits not a dozen yards away. If I {{glance over}} my {{shoulder}} I can see him. And if I catch his eye--and <b>usually</b> <b>I</b> catch his eye--it meets me with an expression---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary! It's the {{one place}} I have been in, {{in the last two}} years, that I have felt really {{satisfied}} with. <b>Usually,</b> <b>I</b> want to move on after a week. But I could stop here forever." ...|$|E
6000|$|Buster grinned. [...] "Yes, Johnny, I try," [...] said he, [...] "and <b>usually</b> <b>I</b> succeed. You see, I {{need to be}} fat {{in order}} to keep warm and also to have {{something}} to live on in the spring, just the same as you do.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{have too}} much to do for that,' said Fanny. 'Having so much to do, Mr Merdle, loss of {{appetite}} is a serious thing with you, and you must have it seen to. You must not be ill.' 'Oh! I am very well,' replied Mr Merdle, after deliberating about it. 'I am as well as <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> am. <b>I</b> am well enough. I am as well as I want to be.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I'm {{trying to}} decide," [...] he replied. [...] "Sometimes I feel like renouncing myself altogether; but <b>usually</b> <b>I</b> give myself another chance. I dare say if I hadn't been so forbearing I might have agreed with your sister about my unfitness for the ministry." ...|$|E
60|$|His mind ran rather {{upon his}} career, and <b>usually,</b> <b>I</b> {{am glad to}} recall, with a note of {{satisfaction}} and approval. In his delirious phases he would most often exaggerate this self-satisfaction, and talk of his splendours. He would pluck at the sheet and stare before him, and whisper half-audible fragments of sentences.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's right,' said Jonas. 'He is not {{fit to be}} left to himself. Why, he {{fastened}} on me to-night; here, upon my coat; like {{a savage}} dog. Old as he is, and feeble as he is <b>usually,</b> <b>I</b> had some trouble to shake him off. You--Hush!--It's nothing. You told me the other woman's name. I forget it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|CANDIDA. Nonsense: it's shut long ago. Come and {{sit down}} on the hearth-rug, and talk moonshine as you <b>usually</b> do. <b>I</b> want to be amused. Don't you want to? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Bless the boy!" [...] {{cried the}} Emperor of the Winkies; [...] "how {{careless}} of {{me not to}} remember that wanderers are <b>usually</b> hungry. <b>I</b> will have food brought you at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes, Mr. Bennett. It {{is packed}} now in my trunk, but <b>usually</b> <b>I</b> carry it about with me {{everywhere}} {{in order to}} take a little practice at the Rupert Street range. I bought it when Sir Mallaby told me he was sending me to America, because I thought I ought to be prepared--because of the Underworld, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{one knows}} it but you four--and myself," [...] replied Oz. [...] "I have fooled {{everyone}} {{so long that}} I thought I should never be found out. It was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. <b>Usually</b> <b>I</b> will not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't," [...] {{spoke up}} Reddy. [...] "I rather enjoy it. It gives me good exercise. Any time I can't fool Bowser by {{breaking}} my trail so he can't find it again, I {{deserve to be}} caught. I am not even so terribly afraid of a hunter with a gun.
