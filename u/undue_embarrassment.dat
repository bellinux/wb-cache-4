40|$|Recently, the {{diffusion}} {{on the black}} market of new psychoactive substances not controlled and often sold as ‘legal highs’, is exponentially increasing in Europe. Generally, the first analysis for these drugs involves an immunoassay screening in urine or plasma. Actually, there is growing interest in the use of oral fluid (OF) as alternative specimen over conventional biological fluids for drug testing, because of the significant advantages, as a non-invasive collection under direct observation without <b>undue</b> <b>embarrassment</b> or invasion of privacy, and a good correlation with plasma analytical data. Few assays have been developed for detection of new psychoactive compounds in biological samples, so it is important to investigate how {{they may or may not}} react in pre-existing commercial immunoassays. In this paper, two different multi-drugs oral fluid screen devices (OFDs) (Screen® Multi-Drug OFD and GIMA One Step Multi-Line Screen Test OFD) were evaluated to determine the cross-reactivity of thirty-nine new amphetamine designer drugs, including twelve substances officially recognized as illicit by italian legislation. Cross-reactivity towards most drugs analyzed was < 1 in assays targeting amphetamine (AMP) or methamphetamine (MET). Only two (p-methoxyamphetamine and p-methoxymethamphetamine) of all tested amphetamines gave a positive result...|$|E
40|$|Humor {{is a part}} {{of daily}} {{interactions}} at all levels. Humor is used to ease stress, distance one from the crisis at hand, improve communication among persons, and ease embarrassment at even the most embarrassing of moments. Humor can be used in almost any setting: classroom, clinical sites, home, or social gatherings. It is one of the universals among persons across all cultural and age stratifications. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the occurrence of humor among nurses and between nurses and patients. The Neuman Systems Model will provide the theoretical framework for this study. This study will be a partial replication of the Astedt-Kurki and Isola (2001) research. The data will be collected from diaries of 10 critical care nurses describing either observed humor or humor in which they were participants each shift the nurse works over a specified amount of time (two weeks). It will be requested that the nurses record humorous experiences in the diary immediately after the end of the shift in order to have the most current thought processes about the humor recorded. A descriptive study design will be used. Permission will be obtained through the Ball State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) as well as the IRB from each participating hospital. A letter of explanation will be provided to the clinical and educational institutions and the study participants. Participation will be totally voluntary, no monetary remuneration will be provided, and no risks have been identified for participation. Humor can lead to improved communication between nurse and patient without the risk of <b>undue</b> <b>embarrassment.</b> Humor allows the patient to voice irritation over those things no longer in his control without being offensive. Humor allows nurses to distance themselves emotionally from some of the stresses and traumas that are part of every day life for nurses. Humor also helps to draw nurses as well as nurses and patients closer over shared laughter. Learning how to better use humor as a nursing intervention can make the healthcare setting more palatable for both the nurse and the patient. School of NursingThesis (M. S. ...|$|E
