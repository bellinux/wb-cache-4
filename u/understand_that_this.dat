5|$|Part of the {{conflict}} between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's frustration with Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control. It's also worth pointing out that Rockstar used to be very keen on making Team Bondi something like 'Rockstar Sydney' - the more they worked with Team Bondi management, the more they came to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a terrible idea.|$|E

25|$|In Christian Europe, {{people were}} persecuted for heresy, {{especially}} {{in countries where}} the Inquisition was active. Thomas Aquinas' five proofs of God's existence and Anselm's ontological argument implicitly acknowledged {{the validity of the}} question about God's existence. Frederick Copleston, however, explains that Thomas laid out his proofs not to counter atheism, but to address certain early Christian writers such as John of Damascus, who asserted that knowledge of God's existence was naturally innate in man, based on his natural desire for happiness. Thomas stated that although there is desire for happiness which forms the basis for a proof of God's existence in man, further reflection is required to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> desire is only fulfilled in God, not for example in wealth or sensual pleasure.|$|E

[...] are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans ... It's being aware of it and {{trying to find a way}} for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense." [...] He added in October that scheduling of each series factors into why crossovers between them are more difficult to pull off, and that network [...] "feelings" [...] need to be considered. He also spoke on why the television series do not show Avengers Tower as it appears in the films when they depict New York City, and stated that Marvel Television wanted to be [...] "less specific" [...] about the television characters' relationships to the tower because that [...] "helps the audience <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> could be on any street corner" [...] and that the characters could be in an area of the city where you would not be able to see the tower, even though it exists.|$|E

2500|$|... "The marvelous" [...] may {{be easily}} {{confused}} with magical realism, as both modes introduce supernatural events without surprising the implied author. In both, these magical events are expected and accepted as everyday occurrences. However, the marvelous {{world is a}} unidimensional world. The implied author believes that anything can happen here, as the entire world is filled with supernatural beings and situations to begin with. Fairy tales are {{a good example of}} marvelous literature. The important idea in defining the marvelous is that readers <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> fictional world is different from the world where they live. The [...] "marvelous" [...] one-dimensional world differs from the bidimensional world of magical realism, as in the latter, the supernatural realm blends with the natural, familiar world (arriving at the combination of two layers of reality: bidimensional). While some use the terms magical realism and lo real maravilloso interchangeably, the key difference lies in the focus.|$|E

On the way down the hill, a vision of Zeena's face startles Ethan into swerving a bit, but he corrects their course, and they crash into the elm tree.

2500|$|In {{certain parts}} of Latin America, the usage of negro to {{directly}} address black people can be colloquial. It is important to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is not similar {{to the use of}} the word nigga in English in urban hip hop subculture in the United States, given that [...] "negro" [...] is not a racist term. For example, one might say to a friend, [...] " [...] (literally 'Hey, black-one, how are you doing?'). In such a case, the diminutive [...] can also be used, as a term of endearment meaning 'pal'/'buddy'/'friend'. [...] has thus also come to be used to refer to a person of any ethnicity or color, and also can have a sentimental or romantic connotation similar to 'sweetheart' or 'dear' in English. (However, in the Philippines negrito was used for a local dark-skinned, short population native to Luzon and the Visayas islands among other places; this is the meaning of Negrito in English.) In other Spanish-speaking South American countries, the word [...] can also be employed in a roughly equivalent term-of-endearment form, though it is not usually considered to be as widespread as in Argentina or Uruguay (except perhaps in a limited regional and/or social context). [...] It is consequently occasionally encountered, due to the influence of nigga, in Chicano English in the United States.|$|E
