25|$|The {{development}} of the triumphal arch {{is often associated with}} ancient Roman architecture.

As a result, the Romans used arches for things such as aqueducts, amphitheaters, bridges, and domed temples. They had effectively used the arch in various aspects of their civilization and city structure. Since the Romans had effectively perfected this architectural structure, one could conclude that the arch symbolized perfection and triumph in Roman society.

Someone other than the group leader or the facilitator should take detailed and in depth notes of the discussion.

The initial conversation should include an “ice breaker” in order to make the members more comfortable and open.|$|E
