40|$|Dimensionality reduction, {{which is}} the process of mapping high-dimension {{patterns}} to lower dimension subspaces, is a key issues in enhancing the processing efficiency of high dimensional data such as hyperspectral images. Dimensionality reduction has been widely discussed in the areas of data mining, image processing, pattern recognition, etc. Because in most situations, many of the dimensions are redundant or unnecessary for the tasks of interest, removing those dimensionality will produce more efficient computation while main-taining the original performance. Dimensionality reduction also reduces the measurement and storage requirements, reduces training and <b>utilization</b> <b>times</b> and it defies the curse of dimensionality to improve classification performance. Feature selection, the process of constructing and selecting the subsets of features that are useful to build a good predictor is of interest for many years.

In the island, the total capacity of wind power that may be installed is up to 1500  MW, and if the average <b>utilization</b> <b>time</b> of wind is 2000 hours per year (or 23 % capacity factor), the achievable energy generation is 3  TWh per year or more, which would be equivalent to the largest wind farms in the world. Cost-effective development of wind power will occur where the average <b>utilization</b> <b>time</b> of wind exceeds 2000 hours per year, so that the generated electricity is {{greater than or equal to}} 1.2  GWh for a wind turbine with 600  kW capacity.

By means of a literature study it was determined what planning as a management task of the beginner principal involves, what the relationship of planning is to other management tasks, and what the relationship between planning and time management is. The complexity of the beginner principal's task was analysed briefly, and an overview was obtained of possible external and internal time obstacles. This was followed by guidelines for control over the time obstacles. Further principles of effective <b>time</b> <b>utilization,</b> such as effective planning, objectives and the setting of objectives, prioritizing, delegating and time management techniques, including the time log, time schedule and time strategies, were discussed.

40|$|The {{potential}} of an efficient ride-sharing scheme to significantly reduce traffic congestion, lower emission level, {{as well as}} facilitating the introduction of smart cities has been widely demonstrated. This positive thrust however is faced with several delaying factors, {{one of which is}} the volatility and unpredictability of the potential benefit (or utilization) of ride-sharing at different times, and in different places. In this work the following research questions are posed: (a) Is ride-sharing <b>utilization</b> stable over <b>time</b> or does it undergo significant changes? (b) If ride-sharing utilization is dynamic, can it be correlated with some traceable features of the traffic? and (c) If ride-sharing utilization is dynamic, can it be predicted ahead of time? We analyze a dataset of over 14 Million taxi trips taken in New York City. We propose a dynamic travel network approach for modeling and forecasting the potential ride-sharing <b>utilization</b> over <b>time,</b> showing it to be highly volatile. In order to model the utilization's dynamics we propose a network-centric approach, projecting the aggregated traffic taken from continuous time periods into a feature space comprised of topological features of the network implied by this traffic. This feature space is then used to model the dynamics of ride-sharing <b>utilization</b> over <b>time.</b> The results of our analysis demonstrate the significant volatility of ride-sharing <b>utilization</b> over <b>time,</b> indicating that any policy, design or plan that would disregard this aspect and chose a static paradigm would undoubtably be either highly inefficient or provide insufficient resources. We show that using our suggested approach it is possible to model the potential utilization of ride sharing based on the topological properties of the rides network. We also show that using this method the potential utilization can be forecasting a few hours ahead of time...|$|R
