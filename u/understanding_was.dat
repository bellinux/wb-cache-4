5|$|The Svalbard Treaty {{specifies}} that {{no military}} installations are permitted on the archipelago. The Soviet authorities {{were concerned that}} a permanent civilian airport {{could also be used}} by Norwegian and NATO forces. But the Soviets also needed an airport to serve their settlements at Barentsburg and Pyramiden, and by the early 1970s, an <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> reached between the two countries.|$|E
5|$|While {{funding for}} the UKVG in the United Kingdom was seriously restricted, the British {{government}} sought to find partners {{in the form of}} NATO members, promoting the concept of creating and procuring a common NATO strike aircraft. In July 1968, a memorandum of <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> signed between Britain, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada. This memorandum eventually led to the launch of the multinational Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) project, which in turn went on to produce a variable geometry aircraft to perform strike, reconnaissance, and interception missions {{in the form of the}} Panavia Tornado.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to test the thesis that people employ sensory-motor conceptual metaphors to understand metaphorical expressions. Congenitally blind and sighted participants paraphrased metaphorical expressions derived from the <b>UNDERSTANDING</b> <b>is</b> GRASPING and <b>UNDERSTANDING</b> <b>is</b> SEEING conceptual metaphors, and evaluated to what extent they felt they had understood them. On the one hand, congenitally blind participants did not comprehend better <b>UNDERSTANDING</b> <b>is</b> GRASPING expressions than <b>UNDERSTANDING</b> <b>is</b> SEEING expressions. On the other hand, sighted participants did not comprehend <b>UNDERSTANDING</b> <b>is</b> SEEING expressions better than the blind.

40|$|This paper {{calls for}} a change in our {{theoretical}} perspectives on the nature of understanding as ideas embedded in the mind-as-container metaphor. In particular, it is suggested that we should adopt Bereiter’s [1] postulation that <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> best understood as resulting from the ways an individual may be positioned relative to the knowledge object. As such, it <b>is</b> proposed that <b>understanding</b> <b>be</b> viewed as an emergent phenomenon resulting from interacting relational perspectives. This form of understanding, herein termed manifold relational <b>understanding,</b> <b>is</b> contrasted against current mental models approaches and a study designed to foster manifold relational <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> discussed. Implications for the design educational technology are examined. 1...|$|R

5|$|By 1858, Malo-Galipeau {{had become}} widely {{recognised}} as foundress of the Misericordia Sisters, {{partly due to}} her role as Mother Superior and {{partly due to the}} endowment she had brought to the community upon her arrival. This <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> reflected in published works of the time, including a souvenir album prepared by the City of Montreal in 1853. However, during Bourget's visit to the Institute in late 1858, he made a speech to the assembled community confirming that in the eyes of himself and of the Church, Cadron-Jetté should receive credit as the foundress of the congregation. He also bestowed upon Cadron-Jetté the title of Mother (such that her religious name became Mother Mary of the Nativity, or Mère de la Nativité) and confirmed that she was second in authority only to the current Mother Superior of the community.|$|E
5|$|No country {{recognised}} the Rhodesian republic. The RF was decisively {{returned to}} power in the first election held as a republic, on 10 April 1970, winning all 50 white seats. Hopes for an Anglo-Rhodesian rapprochement were boosted two months later when the Conservatives won a surprise election victory in the UK. Edward Heath took over as Prime Minister while Douglas-Home became Foreign Secretary. Talks between Douglas-Home and Smith began with a lengthy meeting in Salisbury in April 1971 and continued until a tentative <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> reached in early November. A UK delegation headed by Douglas-Home and the Attorney General Sir Peter Rawlinson flew to Salisbury on 15 November for negotiations over a new constitution, and after six days of discussion an accord was signed on 21 November 1971.|$|E
5|$|On 25 July 1993, {{following}} Hezbollah's {{killing of}} seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, Israel launched Operation Accountability (known in Lebanon as the Seven Day War), {{during which the}} IDF carried out their heaviest artillery and air attacks on targets in southern Lebanon since 1982. The aim of the operation was to eradicate {{the threat posed by}} Hezbollah and to force the civilian population north to Beirut so as to put pressure on the Lebanese Government to restrain Hezbollah. The fighting ended when an unwritten <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> agreed to by the warring parties. Apparently, the 1993 understanding provided that Hezbollah combatants would not fire rockets at northern Israel, while Israel would not attack civilians or civilian targets in Lebanon.|$|E
50|$|From an educological viewpoint, <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> the {{realized}} {{ability to}} perform consciously, purposefully, intelligently and in a well informed way to resolve challenges, solve problems and achieve desired results within some state of affairs. Educological <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> an <b>understanding</b> of states of affairs within the educational process. More specifically, educological <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> the realized {{ability to perform}} consciously, purposefully, intelligently and in a well informed way to resolve challenges, solve problems and achieve desired results for and within the educational process. Educological understanding relates to educological knowing in that educological <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> the achievement of some range of educological knowing at the conventional and post-conventional levels. A wide or extensive range of educological knowing at the conventional and post-conventional levels constitutes educological understanding.|$|R

5|$|The most {{recently}} carved hieroglyphic inscription of ancient Egypt known today {{is found in}} a temple of Philae, dated precisely to 394 AD {{during the reign of}} Theodosius I (r. 379–395 AD). In the 4th century AD, the Hellenized Egyptian Horapollo compiled a survey of almost two hundred Egyptian hieroglyphs and provided his interpretation of their meanings, although his <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> limited and he was unaware of the phonetic uses of each hieroglyph. This survey was apparently lost until 1415, when the Italian Cristoforo Buondelmonti acquired it at the island of Andros. Athanasius Kircher (1601–1680) was the first in Europe to realize that Coptic was a direct linguistic descendant of ancient Egyptian. In his Oedipus Aegyptiacus, he made the first concerted European effort to interpret the meaning of Egyptian hieroglyphs, albeit based on symbolic inferences.|$|E

40|$|Learning in the {{teaching}} process often goes on without proper <b>understanding</b> which <b>is</b> one of important problems that modern didactics tries to solve. In order to direct the totality of teaching towards <b>understanding</b> it <b>is</b> necessary {{to answer the question}} what <b>understanding</b> <b>is,</b> which is why we analysed different philosophical views on the concept of understanding and stressed their semblance to pedagogic explanations. Different kinds of <b>understanding</b> <b>were</b> analyzed as well as their role and contribution in different teaching situations, especially in the context of problem solving. As an alternative to {{the teaching}} based on accumulation of knowledge the characteristics and some principles of teaching focused on <b>understanding</b> <b>are</b> described, and the need for stimulating and developing understanding as an important goal of education. The results of our research unequivocally show that learning with understanding enables students to memorize the teaching material better, as well as to understand the whole teaching subject and efficiently apply the acquired knowledge out of school, and leads to more flexible behaviour and better coping in everyday life...|$|R

25|$|The {{solution}} in radicals (without trigonometric functions) {{of a general}} cubic equation contains the square roots of negative numbers when all three roots are real numbers, a situation that cannot be rectified by factoring aided by the rational root test if the cubic is irreducible (the so-called casus irreducibilis).
