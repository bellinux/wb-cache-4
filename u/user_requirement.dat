50|$|Flowing screeds {{are made}} from inert fillers such as sand, with a binder system based on calcium sulphate. Consequently they can look very similar to a sand/cement screed Flow screeds are often {{preferred}} to traditional cement based screeds as they are faster to install and provide a similar finish. Flow screed is most often used in combination with underfloor heating installation as the reduced thickness provides for more effective and efficient heat transfer. One of the main advantages of liquid flow screed is that, it offers few additional benefits compared to sand and cement. It is anything but difficult to pour, with fluid properties that consider an expedient application and quicker drying time. There aren't any bigger advantages of this product than when combined with underfloor heatingsystem, a lesser thickness of liquid flooring screed, when compared with conventional screeds, minimises heat storage leading to a floor that reacts quickly to <b>user</b> <b>requirement</b> hence raising the efficacy of your underfloor heating method.|$|E

40|$|The first {{geostationary}} Earth {{observation satellite}} of Korea – the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) – was successfully launched on 27 June 2010. After arrival at its operational orbit, the satellite underwent an in-orbit test (IOT) {{that lasted for}} about 8 months. During the IOT period, the main payload for the weather application, the meteorological imager, went through successful tests for demonstrating its function and performance, and the test results are introduced here. The radiometric performance of the meteorological imager (MI) is tested by means of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the visible channel, noise-equivalent differential temperature (NEdT) for the infrared channels, and pixel-to-pixel nonuniformity for both the visible and infrared channels. In {{the case of the}} visible channel, the SNR of all eight detectors is obtained using the ground-measured parameters with the background signals obtained in orbit. The overall performance shows a value larger than 26 at 5 % albedo, exceeding the <b>user</b> <b>requirement</b> of 10 by a significant margin. Also, the relative variability of detector responsivity among the eight visible channels meets the <b>user</b> <b>requirement,</b> showing values within 10 % of the <b>user</b> <b>requirement.</b> For the infrared channels, the NEdT of each detector is well within the <b>user</b> <b>requirement</b> and is comparable with or better than the legacy instruments, except for the water vapor channel, which is slightly noisier than the legacy instruments. The variability of detector responsivity of infrared channels is also below the <b>user</b> <b>requirement,</b> within 40 % of the requirement, except for the shortwave infrared channel. The improved performance result is partly due to the stable and low detector temperature obtained due to spacecraft design, i. e., by installing a single solar panel {{on the opposite side of}} the MI...|$|E
