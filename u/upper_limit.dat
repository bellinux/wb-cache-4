40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} for the emission of X-rays from supernova explosions wherein the thermal distribution of photons from a supernova photosphere is inverse Compton scattered by relativistic electrons within or near {{the surface of the}} star. Using this model, <b>upper</b> <b>limits</b> for the number of relativistic electrons and their total energy are established on the basis of <b>upper</b> <b>limits</b> to the observed X-ray luminosity of a supernova during maximum light. These <b>upper</b> <b>limits,</b> in conjunction with radio frequency <b>upper</b> <b>limits</b> obtained by Brown and Marscher, strongly suggest that supernovae do not produce significant numbers of relativistic particles until at least 70 years after the initial outburst. This, in turn, implies that young supernovae cannot account for the radio and X-ray variability of active galactic nuclei and quasars...|$|R
40|$|It {{is largely}} {{recognized}} that Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) jets involve ultra-relativistic motion. However, {{the value of}} the Lorentz factor Gamma_ 0 is still not clear and only lower limits are known for most bursts. We suggest here a new method to obtain <b>upper</b> <b>limits</b> on Gamma_ 0. The early high-energy synchrotron afterglow flux depends strongly on Gamma_ 0. <b>Upper</b> <b>limits</b> on GeV emission therefore provide <b>uppers</b> <b>limit</b> on Gamma_ 0. Applying this method to 190 Fermi GRBs that have not been detected by the Fermi-LAT we place <b>upper</b> <b>limits</b> on the high-energy afterglow flux, and in turn on Gamma_ 0. For bursts at a typical redshift z= 2, we find values of the order of 200 (and above) for a homogeneous density medium, and in the range 100 - 400 for a wind-like medium. These <b>upper</b> <b>limits</b> are consistent with (and are very close to) lower limits and direct estimates inferred using other methods, suggesting that the typical Lorentz factors of GRB jets are of order a few hundred.

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{research}} the <b>upper</b> <b>limits</b> on the extragalactic background light (EBL).

Other dacite domes which rose on Tehama's flanks are Bumpass Mountain, Helen Ridge, Eagle Peak, Vulcan's Castle and Reading Peak.

5|$|The dust is {{constantly}} being {{removed from the}} main ring {{by a combination of}} Poynting–Robertson drag and electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. Volatile materials, for example ices, evaporate quickly. The lifetime of dust particles in the ring is from 100 to 1000years, so the dust must be continuously replenished in the collisions between large bodies with sizes from 1cm to 0.5km and between the same large bodies and high velocity particles coming from outside the Jovian system. This parent body population is confined to the narrow—about 1000km—and bright outer part of the main ring, and includes Metis and Adrastea. The largest parent bodies must be less than 0.5km in size. The <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> on their size was obtained by New Horizons spacecraft. The previous <b>upper</b> <b>limit,</b> obtained from HST and Cassini observations, was near 4km. The dust produced in collisions retains approximately the same orbital elements as the parent bodies and slowly spirals in the direction of Jupiter forming the faint (in back-scattered light) innermost part of the main ring and halo ring. The age of the main ring is currently unknown, but it may be the last remnant of a past population of small bodies near Jupiter.|$|E
