2500|$|It seems {{a miracle}} that UE survived the 1950s at all, with attacks coming at it from all {{directions:}} the federal administration, Congress, Republicans and Democrats, news media, [...] "mainstream" [...] unions of both CIO and AFL, and even {{some members of the}} clergy. What helped <b>UE</b> <b>to</b> weather these storms was its own democratic structure and manner of operation, and its superior record of representing members (when contrasted with the IUE, for example) in collective bargaining and in fighting for shop grievances. Both of these attributes engendered fierce loyalty to UE among many of its members, even as the union was being slandered by powerful forces as some sort of national security threat.|$|E

30|$|In {{the context}} of this research, one investigates non-contiguous inter-band CA from an upper layer point of view and proposes an {{integrated}} CRRM (iCRRM) entity where CRRM and CA functionalities are performed together. First, by using an integer programming (IP)-based algorithm, the inter-frequency handovers are achieved in an optimized way, performing the scheduling via the optimal solution of a general multi-band scheduling (GMBS) problem. Additionally, due to the complexity and the impossibility of allocating <b>UEs</b> <b>to</b> more than one CC, in the GMBS algorithm proposed in [11], an enhanced multi-band scheduling (EMBS) algorithm is alternatively incorporated into the iCRRM entity. This EMBS performs the scheduling functionalities instead of the GMBS with significantly reduced complexity while facilitating <b>to</b> allocate <b>UEs</b> <b>to</b> multiple CCs.|$|R

Since deploying dense Base Stations (BSs) is not cost efficient, an {{alternative is to}} deploy autonomous drones to supplement existing BSs. A street graph is adopted to represent the area of interest. The outdoor User Equipments (<b>UEs)</b> <b>to</b> be served locate near streets and the 2 D projections of drones are restricted to streets to avoid collision with buildings. We build up a UE density function based on a real dataset, reflecting the traffic in the area. We study four problems: where to deploy single drone <b>to</b> cover maximum <b>UEs,</b> where <b>to</b> deploy $k$ drones cover maximum <b>UEs</b> subject <b>to</b> an inner drone distance constraint, where to deploy $k$ drones cover maximum <b>UEs</b> subject <b>to</b> inner drone distance constraint and drones' battery constraints, and the minimum drones to cover a given percentage of <b>UEs</b> subject <b>to</b> inner drone distance constraint.

In CoMP transmissions, multiple base stations coordinate their transmissions so that served UEs receive data streams with higher downlink (DL) spectral efficiency.

30|$|The SBSs {{are faced}} with some {{constrained}} backhaul bandwidth and limited storage capacity. [4] exploits caching capabilities in SBSs to overcome the backhaul capacity limitations and enhance the QoS of users. A network deployed with M mobile UEs and N SBSs is considered based on Manhattan mobility model. Each SBS experiences unique network conditions due {{to the number of}} UEs currently serviced and the existing traffic load on the backhaul, therefore the SBSs individually decide which <b>UEs</b> <b>to</b> serve, which is then transformed into the problem of UE-SBS association. A utility function is defined as the amount of bits that SBS i (i ∈ N) deliver <b>to</b> <b>UE</b> m (m ∈ M) during the service time in order to formulate the UE-SBS association problem, and the problem is modeled as a one-to-many matching game for a SBS and many <b>UEs.</b> <b>To</b> solve the problem in a decentralized approach, the aim of each SBS is to maximize its own utility. An algorithm based on the deferred acceptance scheme is proposed to identify a UE-SBS matching. The results show that the proposed cell association scheme yields significant performance improvement comparing to a cell association technique without caching considerations.|$|R
