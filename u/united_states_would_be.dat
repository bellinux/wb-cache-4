5|$|Branham {{claimed to}} have had a prophetic revelation in June, 1933 that {{comprised}} seven major events that would occur before the Second Coming of Christ. He believed that five of the seven predictions, relating to world politics, science, and the moral condition of the world, had been fulfilled. The final two visions, one related to the Roman Catholic Church gaining power in the United States and the second detailing the destruction of the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fulfilled by 1977, subsequent to which Christ would return. A comparison of Branham's descriptions of the prophecies reveals his tendency to exaggerate and embellish his actual predictions.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{victory was}} seen as a blow to French stature in Vietnam, as the former colonial power had helped to set up Bảo Đại's State of Vietnam in 1949. They {{consistently}} opposed Diệm and his policies, and unsuccessfully tried to impede him. The U.S. media regarded Diệm's victory as a signal that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the only Western power in South Vietnam. Some felt that this would enable Diệm to rule effectively without French hindrance, while others felt that this would leave too much of a burden on the American government. The French media and diplomatic corps viewed the result as a humiliation. Before the poll, French officials had privately predicted Diệm would dissolve the French High Command and use any victory as justification for scrapping the national reunification elections. The French media viewed the poll as undemocratic and a plot by the Americans to sabotage any prospect of national reunification, but France recognised the Republic of Vietnam soon after.|$|E

25|$|Although Mel Gibson {{wanted to}} call his film The Passion, on October 16, 2003, his {{spokesman}} announced that the title used in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> The Passion of Christ because Miramax Films had already registered the title The Passion with the MPAA for the 1987 novel by Jeanette Winterson. Later, the title was changed again to The Passion of the Christ for all markets.|$|E

25|$|The first {{conference was}} held at the Hotel de Bilderberg in Oosterbeek, Netherlands, from 29 to 31 May 1954. It was {{initiated}} by several people, including Polish politician-in-exile Józef Retinger who, concerned about the growth of anti-Americanism in Western Europe, proposed an international conference at which leaders from European countries and the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> brought together with the aim of promoting Atlanticism—better understanding between the cultures of the United States and Western Europe to foster cooperation on political, economic, and defense issues.|$|E

25|$|Tancredo's has staunchly {{supported}} tightening immigration requirements from Islamic countries. On September 18, 2008, Tancredo introduced H.R. 6975, the Jihad Prevention Act, {{which would}} require aliens to attest {{that they will not}} advocate installing a Sharia law system in the United States as a condition for admission, and for other purposes. Aliens failing to make such an attestation would be ineligible for admission. Further, the visa of any alien advocating the installation of a Sharia law system in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> subject to revocation.|$|E
25|$|On 5 December 1988 (16 {{days prior}} to the attack), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a {{security}} bulletin saying that, on that day, {{a man with an}} Arabic accent had telephoned the US Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, and told them that a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> blown up within the next two weeks by someone associated with the Abu Nidal Organization; he said a Finnish woman would carry the bomb on board as an unwitting courier.|$|E

Three investigations of the incident were conducted by NATO, a joint United States-Afghan group, and the United States Department of Defense. The Department of Defense released its findings on 29 April 2016. MSF has called for an international and independent probe, saying the armed forces who carried out the airstrike cannot conduct an impartial investigation of their own actions.|$|E

25|$|Oppenheimer, who was {{now head}} of the General Advisory Committee of the {{successor}} to the Manhattan Project, the Atomic Energy Commission, presided over a recommendation against {{the development of the}} weapon. The reasons were in part because the success of the technology seemed limited at the time (and not worth the investment of resources to confirm whether this was so), and because Oppenheimer believed that the atomic forces of the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more effective if they consisted of many large fission weapons (of which multiple bombs could be dropped on the same targets) rather than the large and unwieldy super bombs, for which there was a relatively limited number of targets of sufficient size to warrant such a development.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{very little}} was {{returned}} {{except for a}} few ships. Since the Lend-Lease agreement did not provide any practical mechanism for allied nations to make good on any materials or equipment destroyed in the war, the United States government was in fact implicitly conceding that it did not expect the return of every piece of material and equipment that it was loaning to its allies. Any suggestion otherwise in the part of the administration was intended more as political rhetoric to keep public opinion on its side as opposed to serious foreign policy. The intended and actual commitment the United States expected from its allies was to prevent the ravages of the conflict from reaching the North American continent. This in turn helped to ensure that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the world's strongest most prosperous industrial power {{by the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|On September 25, 2007, the United States Supreme Court {{agreed to}} hear a lethal-injection {{challenge}} arising from Kentucky, Baze v. Rees. In Baze, the Supreme Court addressed whether Kentucky's particular lethal-injection procedure comports with the Eighth Amendment and will determine the proper legal standard by which lethal-injection challenges in general should be judged, all {{in an effort to}} bring some uniformity to how these claims are handled by the lower courts. Although uncertainty over whether executions in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> put on hold during the period in which the United States Supreme Court considers the constitutionality of lethal injection initially arose after the court agreed to hear Baze, no executions took place during the period between when the court agreed to hear the case and when its ruling was announced, {{with the exception of one}} lethal injection in Texas hours after the court made its announcement.|$|E
50|$|If the Allies delayed {{accepting}} {{the offer of}} President Wilson, and if, later on, {{the course of the}} war was so unfavourable to them that the intervention of the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> effective, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> probably disinterest themselves in Europe and look to their own protection in their own way.|$|R
5000|$|Daniel D. Huff, {{professor}} emeritus of social work at Boise State University, published a comprehensive analysis of corporate welfare in 1993.

25|$|At {{this turn}} of events, Siho Lamphouthacoul inveigled Kouprasith Abhay into a coup, {{on the grounds}} that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> forced by events to accept their new government. Beginning at 2200 hours on the night of 18/19 April 1964, Siho's police unit Bataillon Special 33 (Special Battalion 33) seized Vientiane's infrastructure. Minister of Defense Phoumi Nosavan was {{contacted}} at 0415 hours; he declined to join the coup. By 0430, another DNC unit, Bataillon Special 11 (Special Battalion 11) had arrested Souvanna Phouma and 15 leading officials of such opposed factions as the Royal Lao Army, Forces Army Neutraliste, and the French Embassy. The coup force emptied the safe in FAN's headquarters and looted Kong Le's home. Some 15 other FAN officials sought asylum from the coup in the Soviet Embassy. The Royal Lao Air Force was placed on alert, with its pilots bedded down in tents on the flight line.|$|E
25|$|Before the Pentagon was built, the United States Department of War was {{headquartered}} in the Munitions Building, a temporary structure erected during World War I along Constitution Avenue on the National Mall. The War Department, {{which was a}} civilian agency created to administer the U.S. Army, was spread out in additional temporary buildings on the National Mall, as well as dozens of other buildings in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia. In the late 1930s a new War Department Building was constructed at 21st and C Streets in Foggy Bottom but, upon completion, the new building did not solve the department's space problem and ended up {{being used by the}} Department of State. When World War II broke out in Europe, the War Department rapidly expanded in anticipation that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> drawn into the conflict. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson found the situation unacceptable, with the Munitions Building overcrowded and the department spread out.|$|E
25|$|By its tenth year, 1976, the National Register listed 46 shipwrecks and vessels. In 1985 Congress {{mandated}} that the National Park Service undertake {{a survey of}} historic maritime sites, including military sites, {{in tandem with the}} National Trust for Historic Preservation and the maritime preservation community. The program was known as the National Maritime Initiative. Its goal was to establish priorities for the preservation of maritime resources and recommend roles for {{the federal government and the}} private sector in addressing those priorities. The program identified eight categories to which the known maritime resources of the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> classified. They included: preserved historic vessels, shipwrecks and hulks (those ships not afloat but not submerged entirely); documentation (logs, journals, charts, photos, etc.); aids to navigation (including coast guard stations and life-saving stations), marine sites and structures (wharves; warehouse, waterfronts, docks, canals, etc.); small craft (less than 40 feet long, less than 20 tons of displacement); artifact collections (fine art, tools, woodwork, parts of vessels, etc.); and intangible cultural resources (shipwright and rigging skills, oral traditions, folklore, etc.).|$|E
