50|$|At {{the start}} of 1954 the SE range all {{received}} raised bases as well as cosmetic updates and changes. By 1958 all but the MM1 had received the new vaporising spirit burners, which had first appeared in 1957 {{with the introduction of}} the all new twin cylinder SE3. Again there was another round of cosmetic changes with updated boiler bands and fireboxes. Combinations of these old and new parts {{can be found in the}} 'transitional' engines of the late 1950s period (e.g. the SE1, 2 and MM2). By the mid-1960s the engines were using pop rivets for the engine frame securing method (along with the entire Mamod range) as well more cosmetic changes. In 1967 the SE range received its next major update with the introduction of the SE1a and SE2a replacing the SE1 and 2. The superheating was gone and the simplified pipe work was all new. The SE2a also got a reversing lever like the 'MEC1' Meccano engine of 1965. Other details such as paint colour, boiler end cap and whistle design as well as decal layout were gradually changed. One point worth mentioning was the fact that from 1967 until about 1972 the Se1, 2 and 3 could be found with a different green paint on their engine frames. This paint was similar to a hammered effect type finish and was probably purchased as a job lot by the Managing Director at the time, Eric Malins. Steve Malins has confirmed that this was the case and his father would try anything new or changes which made production cheaper. The Minor range never received this paint finish. The SE3 was unchanged bar the introduction of the Griffin and George (educational suppliers) version in 1969. This engine was the only real variation to Mamod's biggest post-war stationary engine. It featured the very first silver soldered boiler (at the insistence of G&G) and also had a steam pipe <b>union</b> <b>nut</b> at the boiler instead of the usual stop cock. It carried an extra foil G&G lozenge logo by the engine too. About 2,000 were made until about mid-1970s. It was only sold to schools and came complete with a comprehensive manual for using the engine in lab experiments. Later examples of this engine were standard SE3s but carrying a revised G&G logo of a different design. This Griffin badge could sometimes be found placed alongside the warning labels applied to all stationary engines in 1976 explaining the use of inappropriate fuel containers and refuelling techniques.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a comparison of}} member attitudes in the Professional Association of Teachers (PAT) and the National <b>Unions</b> of Teachers (<b>NUT),</b> often seen as the most "moderate" and "militant" teacher unions respectively. Findings suggest that members of PAT were higher in job satisfaction, and both organizational and professional commitment, with NUT members higher in union citizenship behaviour (UCB) and general pro-union attitudes. For NUT members, pro-union beliefs had a significantly stronger effect on union commitment, and union commitment on UCB. These {{findings are consistent with}} the relative images of the two unions, and also with Bamberger et al. ’s (1999) suggestion that the nature of the membership is likely to moderate the antecedents of union commitment and participation. ...|$|R
