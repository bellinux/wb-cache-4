40|$|Background: Marine microalgae are {{of major}} ecologic and {{emerging}} economic importance. Biotechnological screening schemes of microalgae for specific traits and laboratory experiments to advance our knowledge on algal biology and evolution strongly benefit from culture collections reflecting {{a maximum of}} the natural inter- and intraspecific diversity. However, standard procedures for strain isolation and identification, namely DNA extraction, purification, amplification, sequencing and taxonomic identification still include considerable constraints increasing {{the time required to}} establish new cultures. Results: In this study, we report a cost effective and high-throughput isolation and identification method for marine microalgae. The throughput was increased by applying strain isolation on plates and taxonomic identification by direct PCR (dPCR) of phylogenetic marker genes in combination with a novel sequencing electropherogram based screening method to assess the taxonomic diversity and identity of the isolated cultures. For validation of the effectiveness of this approach, we isolated and identified a range of <b>unialgal</b> <b>cultures</b> from natural phytoplankton communities sampled in the Arctic Ocean.

40|$|The {{life history}} of the red alga Ceramium boydenii {{collected}} from Ariake Bay, Kyushu, was studied in <b>unialgal</b> <b>culture.</b> Tetraspores obtained from field collected plants were globular and dark red in color and averaged 54 μm in diameter.

In addition, male plants were thinner and smaller than females. Carpospores from cystocarps of cultured female plants were morphologically similar to tetraspores. The carpospores germinated and grew into tetrasporophytes with short branchlets bearing tetrasporangia. These tetrasporophytes attained to a length of about 10 cm after 2 months. Thus, the life history pattern of C. boydenii was the Polysiphonia-type. However, gametophytes of this alga were smaller at maturity than tetrasporophytes.

40|$|An {{intertidal}} Chlorella-like alga Mychonastes desiccatus Brown sp. nova, {{capable of}} forming achlorophyllous desiccation-resistant cysts, has been grown in <b>unialgal</b> <b>culture.</b> This small alga was first isolated from a dried sample of a well-studied microbial mat. The mat, located at North Pond, Laguna Figueroa, San Quintin, Baja California, Mexico, is a vertically-stratified microbial community which forms laminated sediments.

Unlike other chlorellae, however, upon desiccation M. desiccatus forms an achlorophyllous, lipid-filled cyst (thick-walled resting stage) in which no plastid is evident. Rewetting leads to chloroplast differentiation, excystment and recovery of the fully green alga. During desiccation, sporopollenin is deposited within a thickening cell wall. Encystment cannot be induced by growth in the dark. The formation of desiccation-induced cysts allows the alga to survive frequent and intermittent periods of dryness. These chlorellae tolerate wide ranges of acidity and temperature; they both grow and form cysts in media in which sodium ions are replaced with potassium. Although the cysts tolerate crystalline salts, the cell grow optimally in concentrations corresponding from three-quarters to full-strength seawater...|$|E

Increasing the concentration of stable zinc or magnesium proportionately decreased the uptake of OljZn, illustrating a competition for binding sites and supporting the adsorptive uptake theory. A discussion of the significance of this work to the reporting of concentration factors is presented. The similarity in function between the heterogeneous periphyton community and <b>unialgal</b> <b>cultures</b> or single species of plants is pointed out. INTRODUCI’ION The importance of periphyton as primary producers and as a source of phytoplankton in lotic habitats has been well established (Blum 1956; Margalef 1960). Periphytic algal comrnunitics have been cxtensivcly studied because of interest in their role in the ecosystem and, from an applied view-point, because of their faculty for con-centrating materials such as pesticides and radionuclides from the surrounding water. Data on radionuclide accumulation by periphyton in natural ecosystems arc of-ten difficult to interpret because of lack of control over environmental conditions (Cushing 1967). We have therefore devel-opcd a controlled laboratory system which alleviates many shortcomings of other such systems, while maintaining resemblance to the natural system. In partcular, we use natural, hcterogencous periphyton commu-nities composed of autotrophs and hctero-trophs in preference to <b>unialgal</b> <b>cultures.</b> Althoug,h this complicates interpretation, the data should closely reflect events i...|$|R

40|$|The dinoflagellate Heterocapsa circularisquama is lethal to {{a variety}} of marine organisms, in particular, commercially {{important}} farmed bivalves. Unlike most dinoflagellate toxins, which are polyketides, the only described toxin from H. circularisquama (H 2 -a) is a porphyrin derivative that functions in light. It is unknown whether H 2 -a is produced specifically for its lytic properties. We searched for toxin-related genes in the transcriptome of a nontoxic strain of H. circularisquama, and surprisingly found the richest set of toxin-related genes yet described in dinoflagellates. There are 87 distinct expressed sequence tag contigs that encode polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthases, as well as 8 contigs that are involved in porphyrin biosynthesis. Phylogenomic analysis shows that many toxin-related genes are widely distributed among dinoflagellates.

For comparison, this method was also applied to pooled individual cells isolated from a <b>unialgal</b> <b>culture</b> of the marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii (Paulsen) Balech and Tangen, a species known to produce spirolides. Both athecate cells and motile forms of gonyaulacoid dinoflagellates derived from size-fractionated plankton material from Nova Scotia, Canada were sorted and pooled by the glass micropipette isolation technique and by flow cytometry. The development of a highly sensitive analytical method for spirolides (detection limit 2 ng ml(- 1) for spirolide B) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and application to micro-extracted samples allowed the accurate determination of spirolide composition in as few as 50 cells. Total spirolide concentrations (fmol cell(- 1)) calculated from pooled micropipette isolated cells were very consistent with those based upon bulk- or micro-extractions of A. ostenfeldii cells from unialgal batch cultures in exponential growth phase. The results of the pooled cell selection from field material from two sites in Nova Scotia confirmed the association of spirolides with vegetative cells of A. ostenfeldii and related athecate forms.

The use of antibiotics appears attractive but must be used in a narrow concentration range to avoid damage to the chloroplast in eukaryotes and lethality to cyanobacteria (Issa, 1999).|$|R
40|$|Thoracosphaera heimii (Lohmann) Kamptner, {{a modern}} thoracosphaerid, and type {{species of the}} genus, was {{isolated}} in Natal, South Africa, and investigated using <b>unialgal</b> <b>cultures</b> and electron microscopy. These observations revealed:(i) The formation of asexual Gymnodinium-like swarmers. (ii) That a calcified coccoid cell, previously {{thought to be a}} coccolithophorid, develops directly from the Gymnodinium-like swarmer. No sexual fusion was observed during the formation of the calcified cell; thus it is not a resting cyst but entirely vegetative. (iii) That the cells contain organelles distinctive of the dinoflagellates, viz. the dinokaryotic nucleus and trichocysts as well as starch which is accumulated in the cytoplasm. (iv) That the cell covering is made up of an outer shell membrane, a calcified layer, an inner shell membrane, pellicle layer and a cytoplasmic membrane. (v) That calcification may occur in Golgi-derived vesicles...|$|R
