5|$|Human {{language}} {{is unique in}} comparison {{to other forms of}} communication, such as those used by non-human animals. Communication systems used by other animals such as bees or apes are closed systems that consist of a finite, <b>usually</b> <b>very</b> limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Usually</b> <b>very</b> {{inquisitive}} {{and friendly}} birds, they will often invade a campsite, searching for edible items, including fruit, insects, and remnants from containers of jam or honey, and milk is particularly favoured. Parent birds feed the young on insects, fruit and nectar, {{and have been}} recorded regurgitating milk to them as well.|$|E
5|$|Active and cheerful, the Russian Toy was {{originally}} bred {{both as an}} anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still active in the breed, {{and they can be}} very vocal. They can become quite attached to their family, regardless of the ages of the family members. Russian Toys are <b>usually</b> <b>very</b> reserved with strangers, but very loyal to their owners, always ready to protect them from any perceived danger.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes must bind their {{substrates}} {{before they}} can catalyse any chemical reaction. Enzymes are <b>usually</b> <b>very</b> specific as to what substrates they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed. Specificity is achieved by binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics to the substrates. Enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be chemoselective, regioselective and stereospecific.|$|E
5|$|Humidity {{levels are}} <b>usually</b> <b>very</b> high all year round. Manila has a {{distinct}} dry season from December through May, and a relatively lengthy wet season that covers the remaining period with slightly cooler temperatures. In the wet season, it rarely rains all day, but rainfall is very heavy during short periods. Typhoons usually occur from June to September.|$|E
5|$|The {{teeth were}} long and slender, {{as opposed to the}} <b>usually</b> <b>very</b> short teeth seen in other abelisaurids. On each side of the upper jaws there were four premaxillary and twelve maxillary teeth, while the lower jaws were {{equipped}} with fifteen dentary teeth per side. In contrast to the robust-looking skull, the lower jaw was shallow and weakly constructed, with the dentary (the foremost jaw bone) connected to the hindmost jaw bones by only two contact points. The lower jaw was found with hyoid bones, in the position they would be in if the animal was alive. These slender bones, supporting the tongue musculature and several other muscles, are rarely found in dinosaurs because they are not connected to other bones and therefore get lost easily.|$|E

5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to uranium (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium in air is <b>usually</b> <b>very</b> small; however, {{people who work in}} factories that process phosphate fertilizers, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mg/m3. At levels of 10mg/m3, uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|Sangay can and {{has been}} climbed. It was first ascended in 1929 by Robert T. Moore, prior to its current {{eruption}} beginning in 1934. However, the volcano's current active state presents dangers to mountaineers {{in the form of}} falling ejecta; in 1976, two members of an expedition on the volcano were struck and killed by falling debris. In addition, the volcano is located in a remote region with poor roads and is difficult to access, and periods of heavy rainfall can flood rivers and cause landslides, rendering the mountain routes impassable. Nonetheless, the Instituto Ecuatoriano Forestal y de Areas Naturales, which maintains an office near the mountain, facilitate such activities by providing local guides and rooms for rent to visitors. Ascension takes between 7 and 10 days from Quito. Conditions on the volcano are <b>usually</b> <b>very</b> wet and foggy, which may impair visibility significantly during the ascent.|$|E
5|$|According to the Hebrew Bible, Solomon's Temple {{was built}} atop {{what is known}} as the Temple Mount in the 10th century BCE and {{destroyed}} by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, and the Second Temple completed and dedicated in 516 BCE. Around 19 BCE Herod the Great began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount. In addition to fully rebuilding and enlarging the Temple, he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood, doubling it in size. Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall. The excavators came upon the coins inside a ritual bath that predates Herod's building project, which was filled in to create an even base for the wall and was located under its southern section. This seems to indicate that Herod did not finish building the entire wall by the time of his death in 4 BCE. The find confirms the description by historian Josephus Flavius, which states that construction was finished only during the reign of King Agrippa II, Herod’s great-grandson. Given Josephus' information, the surprise mainly regarded the fact that an unfinished retaining wall in this area could also mean that at least parts of the splendid Royal Stoa and the monumental staircase leading up to it could not have been completed during Herod's lifetime. Also surprising was the fact that the <b>usually</b> <b>very</b> thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock. Some scholars are doubtful of the interpretation and have offered alternative explanations, such as, for example, later repair work.|$|E
