50|$|Liebigite is a uranium {{carbonate}} mineral {{with the}} chemical formula: Ca2(UO2)(CO3)3·11H2O. It is a secondary mineral {{occurring in the}} oxidizing zone of <b>uranium-bearing</b> <b>ores.</b> It is green to yellow green in colour. It has a Mohs hardness of about 3. Liebigite, like some other uranium minerals, is fluorescent under UV light and is also translucent. It crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, but only rarely forms distinct crystals. It typically forms encrustations or granular aggregates.|$|R
50|$|Uranium mining in Russia was {{conducted}} entirely by the corporation JSC TVELs ore mining enterprises, {{and in particular}} by open pit mining at its subsidiary JSC Priargunsky Industrial Mining & Chemical Union and also by in situ underground leaching at its subsidiaries СJSC Dalur in the Kurgan Oblast and JSC Khiagda in Buryatia. Annual uranium production was about 3,400 t, of which more than 90% was produced by Priargunsky. <b>Uranium-bearing</b> <b>ores</b> and solutions were processed to generate uranium concentrates, which were shipped for further reprocessing at the JSC Chepetsky Mechanical Plant.|$|R
50|$|The mine uses a in-situ leach process, which {{involves}} pumping a weak acid solution into the formation {{to dissolve the}} <b>uranium-bearing</b> <b>ore.</b> The ore-bearing solution is then pumped to the surface for extraction and treatment. This method was chosen to allow the mine to commence operations relatively quickly.|$|E

50|$|The {{mineral deposit}} was {{discovered}} in 1915 by an English geologist Robert Rich Sharp (1881-1958). The mine was worked from 1921 onwards. <b>Uranium-bearing</b> <b>ore</b> was initially exported to Olen, Belgium for the extraction of radium, and uranium. Only the richest ore was sent to Olen, with the remainder held in reserve. Open-cut mining was suspended at level 57 m and at the level 79 m underground in 1936, though exploration had commenced at level 114 m, and water pumps installed at level 150 m.|$|E

50|$|Dating a {{specific}} sample of fossilized carbonaceous material is more complicated. Such deposits often contain trace amounts of carbon-14. These amounts can vary significantly between samples, ranging up to 1% of the ratio found in living organisms, a concentration comparable to an apparent age of 40,000. This may indicate possible contamination by {{small amounts of}} bacteria, underground sources of radiation causing the 14N(n,p) 14C reaction, direct uranium decay (although reported measured ratios of 14C/U in <b>uranium-bearing</b> <b>ores</b> would imply roughly 1 uranium atom for every two carbon atoms in order to cause the 14C/12C ratio, measured {{to be on the}} order of 10−15), or other unknown secondary sources of carbon-14 production. The presence of carbon-14 in the isotopic signature of a sample of carbonaceous material possibly indicates its contamination by biogenic sources or the decay of radioactive material in surrounding geologic strata. In connection with building the Borexino solar neutrino observatory, petroleum feedstock (for synthesizing the primary scintillant) was obtained with low 14C content. In the Borexino Counting Test Facility, a 14C/12C ratio of 1.94×10−18 was determined; probable reactions responsible for varied levels of 14C in different petroleum reservoirs, and the lower 14C levels in methane, have been discussed by Bonvicini et al.|$|R

50|$|Regular {{production}} of <b>uranium-bearing</b> <b>ore</b> in the United States began in 1898 with the mining of carnotite-bearing sandstones of the Colorado Plateau in Colorado and Utah, for their vanadium content. The discovery of radium by Marie Curie, also in 1898, soon made the ore also valuable for radium. Uranium was a byproduct. By 1913, the Colorado Plateau uranium-vanadium province was supplying {{about half of}} the world supply of radium. Production declined sharply after 1923, when low-cost competition from radium from the Belgian Congo and vanadium from Peru made the Colorado Plateau ores uneconomic.|$|E
50|$|While uranium is used {{primarily}} for nuclear power, uranium mining {{had its roots}} in the production of <b>uranium-bearing</b> <b>ore</b> in 1898 with the mining of carnotite-bearing sandstones of the Colorado Plateau in the 1950s saw a boom in uranium mining in the western U.S., spurred by the fortunes made by prospectors such as Charlie Steen. The United States was the world's leading producer of uranium from 1953 until 1980. In 1960 annual U.S. production peaked at 17,055 metric tons U3O8. Until the early 1980s, there were active uranium mines in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.|$|E
50|$|The {{radiation}} hazards of uranium mining and milling were not appreciated {{in the early}} years, resulting in workers being exposed {{to high levels of}} radiation. Inhalation of radon gas caused sharp increases in lung cancers among underground uranium miners employed in the 1940s and 1950s. Risks related to the inhalation of radon gas and the deposition of radon daughter products in the lung were discussed publicly as early as 1951 in American newspapers. The hazard was considered to be generally greater in deeper underground workings, where providing adequate ventilation and suppressing dust was more difficult. Concerns for American miners' health were based on the observation of elevated lung cancer incidence among miners who mine <b>uranium-bearing</b> <b>ore</b> underground in Czechoslovakia and Germany.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is {{responsible}} for cleanup activities at the Fernald Environmental Management Project (FEMP) site in southwestern Ohio. The 425 -hectare site consists of a former 55 -hectare Production Area, an adjacent Waste Storage Area and various support facilities. From 1952 until 1989, the FEMP processed uranium into metallic {open_quotes}feed{close_quotes} materials for other DOE facilities in the nation`s defense program. In accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the FEMP site is currently listed on the National Priorities List (NPL). To facilitate an expeditious cleanup effort, environmental issues associated with site cleanup are being managed under five operable units. This paper summarizes the risk assessment strategy employed to determine baseline human health risks associated with K- 65 and metal oxide residues currently stored in Operable Unit 4. The K- 65 and metal oxide residues were generated during the 1950 s {{as a result of}} the extraction of uranium from <b>uranium-bearing</b> <b>ores</b> and concentrates. These residues are currently stored within Operable Unit 4 in concrete silos. Silos I and 2 contain approximately 6, 120 cubic meters [m{sup 3 }] (8, 005 cubic yards [yd{sup 3 }]) of K- 65 residues, while silos 3 contains approximately 3890 m{sup 3 } (5, 080 yd{sup 3 }) of cold metal oxides. These concrete silos are beyond their design life and require remedial action. The risk assessment conducted for Operable Unit 4 constitutes the first detailed human health risk assessment to be approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the CERCLA clean-up effort at the FEMP Site. This paper discusses the FEMP`s use of a Risk Information Quality Objective process in concert with the traditional risk assessment approach to determine baseline risk to human health and the environment posed by Operable Unit 4. A summary of the baseline risks to human health is also presented...|$|R
40|$|During World War II, the Manhattan Engineering District (MED) {{utilized}} {{facilities in}} the Buffalo, New York area to extract natural uranium from <b>uranium-bearing</b> <b>ores.</b> The Linde property {{is one of several}} properties within the Tonawanda, New York Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) site, which includes Linde, Ashland 1, Ashland 2, and Seaway. Union Carbide Corporation's Linde Division was placed under contract with the Manhattan Engineering District (MED) from 1942 to 1946 to extract uranium from seven different ore sources: four African pitchblende ores and three domestic ores. Over the years, erosion and weathering have spread contamination from the residuals handled and disposed of at Linde to adjacent soils. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) negotiated a Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) governing remediation of the Linde property. In Fiscal Year (FY) 1998, Congress transferred cleanup management responsibility for the sites in the FUSRAP program, including the Linde Site, from the DOE to the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), with the charge to commence cleanup promptly. All actions by the USACE at the Linde Site are being conducted subject to the administrative, procedural, and regulatory provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the existing FFA. USACE issued a Proposed Plan for the Linde Property in 1999 and a Final Record of Decision (ROD) in 2000. USACE worked with the local community near the Tonawanda site, and after considering public comment, selected the remedy calling for removing soils that exceed the site-specific cleanup standard, and transporting the contaminated material to off-site locations. The selected remedy is protective of human health and the environment, complies with Federal and State requirements, and meets commitments to the community...|$|R
50|$|Uranium mining has {{occurred}} in South Australia, since the early 20th century, when radium was the target mineral in <b>uranium-bearing</b> <b>ore.</b> During the Cold War, the Playford government facilitated {{the development of the}} Radium Hill uranium mine and the associated Port Pirie uranium treatment complex. These closed in the early 1960s after a seven year contract of supply had been fulfilled. In the 1970s, the discovery of a massive uranium-bearing IOCG orebody near Roxby Downs led to the eventual opening of the Olympic Dam mine in 1988. In the 2000s, the sector expanded to include in-situ leach mining operations at Beverley, Four Mile and Honeymoon. As of May 2016, Beverley and Honeymoon mines are in care and maintenance mode owing to weak uranium prices {{in the wake of the}} Fukushima nuclear disaster.|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} report {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Environmental Science Johannesburg, November 2012. Acid rock drainage (ARD) and dust are potential consequences of gold and uranium mine residue deposits (MRDs) on the Witwatersrand basin. Urbanisation has taken place around mines and, with the curtailing of mining activities and clearing of land previously covered by MRDs, there is pressure to use this land for residential, industrial and agricultural purposes. However, mining companies historically {{were not required to}} provide pollution control measures and there is evidence for contamination of land and water. Thus, {{there is a need to}} prioritise contamination sources for mitigation and to understand the extent of contamination and potential risks associated with different categories of land-use on mining land. The aim of my study was to conduct a first-order risk assessment to aid in identifying vulnerable land use in the vicinity of gold and uranium mining, and prioritising MRDs, including footprints, for mitigation. To achieve this I constructed a Geographical Information System (GIS) using publicly available spatial data, and then tested the usefulness of historical aerial photographs and remote sensing imagery for mapping MRDs and impacts of MRD origin under Highveld conditions (i. e. a seasonal climate with summer rainfall and annual evapotranspiration of > 2. 5 times mean annual precipitation). The Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality (EMM; 1923 km 2) is an area of extensive historical mining with major urbanisation, while retaining areas for agricultural land use; thus it was selected as a representative study site. I used a numerical rating scheme, which combined a number of parameters in two separate stages to calculate a risk index. The first stage involved the classification of hazards associated with MRDs while the second involved an assessment of land use vulnerability based on exposure pathways and proximity. Historical aerial photographs (1938, 1964 and 2003) and the Chamber of Mines (CoM) Dump Indexes were used to identify and classify MRDs in terms of basic geotechnical properties, current status and historical failure. Multi-spectral data, acquired over two years (2002 and 2003) in two seasons (spring and summer) by the TERRA satellite’s Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor, were used to compile thematic images, indicating potential contamination of surrounding land. It was intended that a zone of influence could be distinguished for each MRD enabling me to rate the hazard severity. The thematic images I selected included primary minerals (pyrophyllite and chlorite), secondary minerals (copiapite and jarosite), an indicator of <b>uranium-bearing</b> <b>ore</b> (referred to as mincrust) and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). These minerals were chosen as potential indicators of different transport routes of contaminants and I tested their associations with different features and land use. I also tested for seasonal differences in the detection of these minerals, and used NDVI to examine the masking effect of active vegetation. I found GIS to be well suited for combining the various forms of spatial data and providing information about MRDs, aqueous pathways, proximity to vulnerable land uses and impacted areas. However, I found that the potential severity of the hazards posed by each MRD, as indicated by a zone of influence, could not be determined from aerial photographs and ASTER alone. I therefore utilised the findings expressed in the literature survey to assign ratings for the different classes of MRDs. The vulnerability assessment was also supplemented by literature review to rate land uses based on human exposure pathways. I determined that MRDs (including footprints) cover 4. 1...|$|E
