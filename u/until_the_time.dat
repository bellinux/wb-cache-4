5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> came to add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and taste like molasses.|$|E

5|$|In Hinduism, {{suicide is}} {{generally}} frowned upon {{and is considered}} equally sinful as murdering another in contemporary Hindu society. Hindu Scriptures state that one who dies by suicide will {{become part of the}} spirit world, wandering earth <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> one would have otherwise died, had one not taken one's own life. However, Hinduism accepts a man's right to end one's life through the non-violent practice of fasting to death, termed Prayopavesa. But Prayopavesa is strictly restricted to people who have no desire or ambition left, and no responsibilities remaining in this life. Jainism has a similar practice named Santhara. Sati, or self-immolation by widows, was prevalent in Hindu society during the Middle Ages.|$|E

The Voronezh Front, commanded by General Nikolai Vatutin, defended the southern face of the salient. The Steppe Front, commanded by Colonel General Ivan Konev, formed the strategic reserve.
