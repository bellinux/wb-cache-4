Aconcagua, Coropuna, Chachani, El Plomo, El Toro, Llullaillaco, Mercedario amd Picchu Picchu are other mountains with Inca sanctuaries.|$|E
5|$|Fort Ricasoli saw <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> French {{invasion}} of Malta in June 1798, during the French Revolutionary Wars. At the time, it was commanded by the Bali de Tillet, and was garrisoned by the Cacciatori, who were a volunteer chasseur light infantry regiment. The fort repelled three French attacks, before surrendering after Grand Master Hompesch officially capitulated to Napoleon.|$|E

5|$|The similar Dardanelles Guns (for the location) {{were created}} by Munir Ali in 1464 and were still in <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Turkish War (1807–09).

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War between the supporters of Charles I and those of Parliament in 1642, Dartmouth initially sided with Parliament and the town invested money in Kingswear's castle doors. The following year, Prince Maurice besieged and took the town. An earthwork fort, called Mount Ridley or Kingsworth, may subsequently have been built to protect the vulnerable position behind Kingswear Castle; an alternative supposition is that the fort was first built in 1627 and was simply brought back into <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> conflict. In January 1646, Sir Thomas Fairfax led a Parliamentary army to retake Dartmouth, capturing Kingswear from Sir Henry Cary, the High Sheriff of Devon, who had been left in charge of defending it.|$|E

5|$|Fort Ricasoli saw <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> French {{invasion}} of Malta in 1798 {{and the subsequent}} Maltese insurrection, after which it ended up in British hands. Ricasoli {{was the site of}} the Froberg mutiny in 1807, and it was also used as a military hospital during the 19th century. It saw use once again in World War II, when parts of it were destroyed by aerial bombardment. After it was decommissioned in the 1960s, the fort was used for industrial purposes. Today, the fort remains mostly intact but in a dilapidated state, and it is used as a filming location and a tank cleaning facility.|$|E
5|$|In France, organ music {{developed}} during the Baroque era through the music of Jean Titelouze, François Couperin, and Nicolas de Grigny. Because the French organ of the 17th and early 18th centuries was very standardized, a conventional set of registrations developed for its repertoire. The music of French composers (and Italian composers such as Girolamo Frescobaldi) was written for <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Mass. Very little secular organ music was composed in France and Italy during the Baroque period; the written repertoire is almost exclusively intended for liturgical use. In England, composers such as John Blow and John Stanley wrote multi-sectional free works for liturgical use called voluntaries through the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In its 2002 {{evaluation}} of Vancouver's bid during the bidding {{process for the}} 2010 Games, the Evaluation Commission of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) highlighted the number and quality of existing competition and training facilities {{as one of the}} bid's strengths. Of the competition venues that the bid proposed for <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Games, six required new construction, with the remainder already built in Vancouver and Whistler. The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (VANOC), which is responsible for the construction and maintenance of facilities for the Games, pledged that all new construction of permanent facilities, whether on public or private land, would be funded by the government.|$|E

On 21 May 2010, over 35,000 Barcelona supporters packed into Camp Nou to see Villa's presentation, where he revealed the kit Barcelona would <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2010–11 season.

5|$|The Portishead line again saw {{a rise in}} <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Second World War, as Bristolians {{evacuated}} to {{the more}} rural areas of Pill and Portishead commuted in to work, many alighting at Clifton Bridge and walking across the Cumberland Basin bridges, the Rownham Ferry now obsolete. During air raids, people would sleep aboard carriages in the station sidings, or in Clifton Bridge No. 1 tunnel north of the station. The station was also used during the war for timber traffic from the local woodlands, loaded onto trains {{by members of the}} Women's Land Army. Other freight traffic included goods from the Ashton Containers factory and a local firm dealing in herbal medicine.|$|E

The northern gate was primarily reserved for military matters; the eastern gate was in civic <b>use.</b> <b>During</b> <b>the</b> Mamluk period, the eastern gate {{was one of two}} locations, the other being the Umayyad Mosque, where official decrees were posted, and this is reflected in a number of inscriptions that have been found here.|$|E

5|$|The crew {{spent the}} {{following}} months {{preparing for the}} forthcoming dash for the pole. They built sledges that would facilitate fast travel over rough terrain and constructed kayaks on the Inuit model, for <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> expected water crossings. There were endless trials of special clothing and other gear. Violent and prolonged tremors began to shake the ship on 3 January 1895, and two days later the crew disembarked, expecting the ship to be crushed. Instead the pressure lessened, and the crew went back on board and resumed preparations for Nansen's journey. After the excitement {{it was noted that}} Fram had drifted beyond Greely's Farthest North record of 83°24, and on 8 January was at 83°34′N.|$|E
