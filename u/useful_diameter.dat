To put these expectations (which we had already developed at the conceptual level in the QuantEYE study for the 100 m OverWhelmingly Large Telescope 2, 6 to experimental test in the real astronomical environment, we realized a small prototype (Aqueye) for the Asiago 182 cm telescope. 10 This instrument is the fastest photon counting photometer ever built. It has 4 parallel channels operating simultaneously, feeding 4 Single Photon-Avalanche Diodes (SPADs), with the ability to push the time tagging capabilities below the nano-second region for hours of continuous operation. Aqueye has been extensively used to acquire photons from a variety of variable stars, in particular from the pulsar in the Crab Nebula. Following this successful realization, a larger version, named Iqueye, has been built for the 3. 5 m New Technology Telescope (NTT) of ESO.

50|$|Electrostatic {{deflection}} is {{very useful}} for small deflection angles but {{is well known}} to be inferior to magnetic deflection for deflecting a charged particle beam into large angles - say over 10 degrees. The reason is that deflection aberrations become large as the deflection angle increases. This reduces the ability to finely focus the beam. Also in electrostatic deflection {{it has long been}} the practice to inject the beam midway between the charged deflection plates so as to avoid the fringe fields as much as possible. However it was found by computation methods that deflection aberrations would be significantly reduced if the beam were injected offset toward the attracting plate. That way the beam tends to follow equipotentials and the deflection force is normal to the beam direction. Thus offset, all the electrons in the beam are deflected into the same angle. There is an induced astigmatism that is correctable. This deflection idea has been tested and verified. Deflection angles of 50 degrees are reportedly possible without measurable deflection aberration. Optimal injection offset is approximately 1/3 of the plate gap toward the deflecting plate. The <b>useful</b> beam <b>diameter</b> is also approximately 1/3 of the gap. See M. Retsky and R. Stein. Testing an electron beam deflection innovation: Initial results. Jour.

40|$|Bounded model {{checking}} (BMC) {{has gained}} widespread industrial use {{due to its}} relative scalability. Its exhaustiveness over all valid input vectors allows it to expose arbitrarily complex design flaws. However, BMC is limited to analyzing only a specific time window, hence will only expose those flaws which manifest within that window and thus cannot readily prove correctness. The diameter of a design has thus become an important concept — a bounded check of depth equal to the diameter constitutes a complete proof. While the diameter of a design may be exponential {{in the number of}} its state elements, in practice it often ranges from tens to a few hundred regardless of design size. Therefore, a powerful diameter overapproximation technique may enable automatic proofs that otherwise would be infeasible. Unfortunately, exact diameter calculation requires exponential resources, and overapproximation techniques may yield exponentially loose bounds. In this paper, we provide a general approach for enabling the use of structural transformations, such as redundancy removal, retiming, and target enlargement, to tighten the bounds obtained by arbitrary diameter approximation techniques. Numerous experiments demonstrate that this approach may significantly increase the set of designs for which practically <b>useful</b> <b>diameter</b> bounds may be obtained. ...|$|E

40|$|Abdominal aortic {{aneurysm}} (AAA) rupture {{is believed to}} occur when the local mechanical stress exceeds the local mechanical strength of the wall tissue. On {{the basis of this}} hypothesis, the knowledge of the stress acting on the wall of an unruptured aneurysm could be useful in determining the risk of rupture. The role of asymmetry has previously been identified in idealized AAA models and is now studied using realistic AAAs in the current work. Fifteen patient-specific AAAs were studied to estimate the relationship between wall stress and geometrical parameters. Three-dimensional AAA models were reconstructed from computed tomography scan data. The stress distribution on the AAA wall was evaluated by the finite element method, and peak wall stress was compared with both diameter and centerline asymmetry. A simple method of determining asymmetry was adapted and developed. Statistical analyses were performed to determine potential significance of results. Mean von Mises peak wall stress ± standard deviation was 0. 4505 ± 0. 14 MPa (range, 0. 3157 - 0. 9048 MPa). Posterior wall stress increases with anterior centerline asymmetry. Peak stress increased by 48 % and posterior wall stress by 38 % when asymmetry was introduced into a realistic AAA model. The relationship between posterior wall stress and AAA asymmetry showed that excessive bulging of one surface results in elevated wall stress on the opposite surface. Assessing the degree of bulging and asymmetry that is experienced in an individual AAA may be of benefit to surgeons in the decision-making process and may provide a <b>useful</b> adjunct to <b>diameter</b> as a surgical intervention guide. There is much debate about the most appropriate time to intervene with surgical treatment of abdominal {{aortic aneurysm}}s. Currently, maximum diameter is deemed the most accurate indicator of rupture potential because size is not only an obvious factor in the decision-making process but is also easy for the clinician to determine from computed tomography scans.

Both types of fibres provide light guidance in the NIR and green spectral regions via the Anti- Resonant Reflecting Optical Waveguiding (ARROW) mechanism. NCFs exhibit extremely low attenuations of 0. 04 dB/m and 0. 15 dB/m at 1030 nm and 532 nm respectively, not achievable with photonic bandap hollow-core fibres. These fibres {{have been demonstrated}} to deliver NIR and green picosecond pulses with peak powers {{at the level of}} 15 MW and 5 MW respectively, which significantly exceeds the capabilities of commercially available singlemode fibres. Optimised NCFs for transmission in both spectral regimes provide singlemode, high quality output and maintain the spectral and temporal properties of the original laser pulse. Furthermore, these fibres exhibit a low sensitivity to bending with <b>useful</b> bend <b>diameters</b> ≥ 5 cm, which is sufficient for most beam delivery applications. This was further improved by developing and introducing a dynamic fibre delivered power stabilisation system which enables efficient compensations of bend-induced power fluctuations. Practical implementation of NCF delivered pulses in manufacturing applications has been demonstrated in the precision micro-machining of metals, crack-free micromilling of fused silica and waveguide writing in borosilicate glass. The FBARF structure is a modification of the NCF design aimed for an improvement in energy handling capacity, light confinement and further reduction of bending loss. However, the fibres reported in this thesis (fabricated for guidance at 1 μm and green wavelengths) are preliminary designs, and so their full potential e. g. their energy handling capacities could not be fully established. Nevertheless, initial tests performed within this work indicated that further development of this fibre design should result in a reduction of the intrinsic attenuation and bend loss to a level comparable with the NCFs while increasing the optical damage threshold...|$|R

Particles of a certain dry size all showed similar diameter growth and the Gf at RH = 90 % for 110 / 100 nm particles was 1. 68 in the 1 MW boiler, and 1. 5 in the 1. 5 MW boiler.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Steel {{wire rope}} is the {{accepted}} standard in logging. It is strong, durable, stiff, and dependable in the logger's arsenal. However, {{steel wire rope}} has several disadvantages: its strength to weight ratio is low; it is difficult and time-consuming to splice; and used wire ropes contain jaggers. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) braided rope has potential to replace steel wire rope. The offshore mooring and shipping industries have appreciated it for years. Characteristics such as a specific gravity less than one (it floats!), high flexibility, low stretch, and ease of splicing make the synthetic rope <b>useful.</b> At equivalent <b>diameters,</b> synthetic rope has an equal or greater breaking strength to that of steel wire rope, but at 1 / 7 the weight. This thesis is {{an investigation of the}} end connectors for the unique physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of UHMW-PE 12 -strand braided rope that make this technology of interest in logging applications. This studied focused on three diameter classes of the synthetic rope that are common to logging operations: 3 / 8 ", 9 / 16 ", and 5 / 8 ". Within each diameter class there were five different spools representing separate production runs. A randomized complete block design was used with each diameter class and the corresponding five spools a separate population. Following the laboratory tests, the breaking strengths were compared to the buried eye splice. Three types of end connectors were evaluated during this pilot study. They are identified as spliced, adhesives, and dry hardware. Spliced end connections provided consistent performance in breaking strengths. The end connections with adhesives had variable strength performance laboratory tests and are therefore not recommended. Within the dry hardware end connections, the pinned nubbin and knuckle link provided the highest breaking strength relative to the buried eye splice. This project has accomplished its objectives. It was the first extensive study on end connections specifically designed for synthetic rope. New end connections were developed and steel wire rope connections were modified to meet the strength and usability criteria for timber harvesting operations. Suitable end connections for forest operations were: buried eye splice, Whoopie Sling, long splice, rope clamps, knuckle link, pinned nubbin, and Y-splice. These end connections suitable for use with forest operations were identified and recommended user guidelines were given.

5000|$|In 1911 the Dumet-wire seal {{was invented}} {{which is still}} the common {{practice}} to seal copper leads through soda-lime or lead glass. If copper is properly oxidised before it is wetted by molten glass a vacuum tight seal of good mechanical strength can be obtained. After copper is oxidized, it is often dipped in a borax solution, as borating the copper helps prevents over-oxidation when reintroduced to a flame. Simple copper wire is not usable because its {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} is much higher than that of the glass. Thus, on cooling a strong tensile force acts on the glass-to-metal interface and it breaks. Glass and glass-to-metal interfaces are especially sensitive to tensile stress. Dumet-wire is a copper clad wire (about 25% of the weight of the wire is copper) with a core of nickel-iron alloy 42, an alloy with a composition of about 42% nickel. [...] The core has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, allowing for a wire with a coefficient of radial thermal expansion which is slightly lower than the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of the glass, so that the glass-to-metal interface is under a low compression stress. It is not possible to adjust the axial thermal expansion of the wire as well. Because of the much higher mechanical strength of the nickel-iron core compared to the copper, the axial thermal expansion of the Dumet-wire is about the same as of the core. Thus, a shear stress builds up which is limited to a safe value by the low tensile strength of the copper. This is also the reason why Dumet is only <b>useful</b> for wire <b>diameters</b> lower than about 0.5 mm. In a typical Dumet seal through the base of a vacuum tube a short piece of Dumet-wire is butt welded to a nickel wire at one end and a copper wire at the other end. When the base is pressed of lead glass the Dumet-wire and a short part of the nickel and the copper wire are enclosed in the glass. Then the nickel wire and the glass around the Dumet-wire are heated by a gas flame and the glass seals to the Dumet-wire. The nickel and copper do not seal vacuum tight to the glass but are mechanically supported. The butt welding also avoids problems with gas-leakages at the interface between the core wire and the copper.|$|R
