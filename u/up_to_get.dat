The next week, she follows him in and finds that he is attending an AA meeting. Liz pretends to be an alcoholic {{so that she can}} get closer to Floyd and hear his secrets. After finding out that members of the same AA group are not allowed to date, Liz confesses to Floyd that she was never an alcoholic and that she made it <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> close to him. He gets mad and feels betrayed, so she apologizes and tells him all of her secrets to make it up to him. Floyd forgives her and they begin dating.|$|E
5|$|On October 22, 2013, the Ethan Lader-directed {{music video}} premiered via rap mogul Diddy's {{television}} network Revolt. The video shows an overly intoxicated Ty Dolla Sign and B.o.B drugged with paranoia about their various women. Ty is hunted down by his two female lovers when they discover {{that he has}} been cheating on them. They team <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> revenge, chasing him through the streets and attacking him at home. By the end of the night, Ty finds himself bleeding out on the middle of his kitchen floor, from a stab wound courtesy of his two lovers. Meanwhile, B.o.B suffers a similar fate via a drugged drink given to him by a seductive, promiscuous woman. Ty's body is then taken away in the trunk of a car.|$|E

5|$|The {{teams were}} as evenly matched {{in the third}} quarter as they had been in the first, with Vanderbilt gaining only two first downs. Soon after the start of the fourth quarter Neely intercepted a pass, weaving for a 25-yeard return to Georgia's 40-yard line. Two long pass {{attempts}} failed, and Thomas Ryan lined up to punt. Rupert Smith sneaked in behind Ryan, rushing to recover the 25-yard onside kick from scrimmage. Smith jumped <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ball from a horde of Bulldogs after they let it bounce, and raced for a 15-yard touchdown. After he added an extra point, the game ended in a 7–7 tie.|$|E
5|$|Writer Mike Scully came up {{with the}} idea for the plot because he used to live in West Springfield, Massachusetts and he would ask his parents if he could take the bus to Springfield, Massachusetts and they finally agreed to let him one day. The {{production}} team faced several challenges during development of this episode. The animators had to come up with a special mouth chart to draw Bart's mouth with the joke teeth in. The pile of dead animals in the back of Cletus' truck originally included dead puppies, but the animators thought it was too sad, so they removed them. Scully used to write jokes for Yakov Smirnoff so he called him <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the signs in Russian. Dan Castellaneta had to learn proper Russian pronunciation so he could speak it during the chess scene in which he voiced the Russian chess player.|$|E
5|$|For the Ladder match, the Intercontinental belts {{belonging}} to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, {{and the first}} wrestler to use the ladder to reach both belts would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel {{to return to the}} dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor, but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought the ladder to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts, but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder. Michaels then set the ladder up {{in the corner of the}} ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder. He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the belts. Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach the belts. Michaels dropkicked the ladder, which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto the ladder, and used his weight to push it down across Ramon's chest. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} year {{before the end of}} the war, the Confederate {{railroad}} system stood permanently on the verge of collapse. There was no new equipment and raids on both sides systematically destroyed key bridges, as well as locomotives and freight cars. Spare parts were cannibalized; feeder lines were torn <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> replacement rails for trunk lines, and rolling stock wore out through heavy use.|$|E
25|$|Those {{wishing to}} climb Napes Needle should be warned that a safe descent {{is far more}} {{difficult}} than the ascent as there are no permanent anchors or bolts from which to abseil. Down-climbing {{is the only way}} to get from the summit to the shoulder and gear on this second pitch is sparse to say the least. A relatively simple abseil can be set <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> down from the shoulder.|$|E

25|$|Humor in {{the show}} was based on farce, often relying on {{innuendo}} and misunderstanding, {{as well as physical}} comedy to punctuate the hare-brained schemes the characters would invariably conjure <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> themselves out of situations and dilemmas. Running jokes were frequently based on Jack's (supposed) sexual orientation, Mr. Roper's lack of sexual prowess, and Chrissy's blonde moments. Conflict {{in the show}} came from the dysfunctional marriage of the Ropers, Janet's intolerance for a roommate romance, and later on, Jack's friendship with Larry and Larry's abuse thereof. Of all the characters, only Jack, Janet, and Larry appeared in all eight seasons of the series.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, a {{committee}} was set <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> La Tinta to municipality status but these pioneers confronted serious problems, including death threats {{and had to}} desist. A new committee was formed in 1987, {{but it was not}} until 1999 that the group directed by José Gilberto Artola Choc accomplished the new designation. The reasons they argued to get their independent status were the distance that Panzós was from La Tinta -30km, approximately- the increase in economic activity in La Tinta -and the decay in Panzós after the Verapaz Railroad ceased operations in the 1960s-, the population was more than enough to get the municipality designation and the lack of support that Panzós gave La Tinta.|$|E
25|$|Magpies {{have been}} {{observed}} engaging in elaborate social rituals, possibly including the expression of grief. Mirror self-recognition has been demonstrated in European magpies, making them one of but a few species and the only non-mammal known to possess this capability. The cognitive abilities of the Eurasian magpie are regarded as evidence that intelligence evolved independently in both corvids and primates. This is indicated by tool use, an ability to hide and store food across seasons, episodic memory, using their own experience to predict the behavior of conspecifics. Another behavior exhibiting intelligence is cutting their food in correctly sized proportions for {{the size of their}} young. In captivity, magpies {{have been observed}} counting <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> food, imitating human voices, and regularly using tools to clean their own cages. In the wild, they organise themselves into gangs and use complex strategies hunting other birds and when confronted by predators.|$|E

25|$|Uchimura {{competed in}} the London 2012 Olympics and had a rocky {{performance}} in the qualifications with several falls, eventually putting him in ninth place among the group of qualifiers for the all-around. In the men's team gymnastics final, Uchimura fell from the pommel horse during his dismount. The Japanese coaches appealed the scoring on this performance as he still landed on his feet and felt it should have counted as a full dismount, albeit with a large penalty. Before the appeal, Britain were to get silver and Ukraine bronze, but the appeal pushed Japan's points total <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the silver and pushing Britain down to bronze. In the men's all around final, Uchimura dominated the competition and {{won the gold medal}} with a score of 92.690. He also won the silver medal in the men's floor exercise event final with a score of 15.8, thanks to the tie-breaking procedure working in his favour was automatically activated because of a tied second highest score of the final with Russia's Denis Ablyazin who competed a routine with the highest difficulty score, an enormous 7.1, of all the finalists.|$|E
25|$|Brady gives Kristen {{a second}} chance when he finds out she stopped John's attempt to seduce her, but when Marlena overhears Kristen say she slept with another man while {{separated}} from Brady, she aims {{to find out what}} Kristen is up to.

Kristen finds out, though, and has thugs beat Marlena <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the drive back. She's unsuccessful, and Marlena is later able to recover it. The drive is encrypted, though, and she asks for the help of Victor Kiriakis to decode it. He's able to open the drive, and tells her that it's proof Kristen slept with another man. He convinces Marlena to play it at Brady and Kristen's wedding ceremony. Marlena discovers, though, {{along with the rest of}} the congregation, that the man in the video is her son Eric, who was drugged and raped by Kristen as revenge against Marlena. Marlena had to try and repair her relationship with both Brady and Eric. Marlena got caught up in the drama surrounding her children's lives, as Eric decided to leave his priesthood and pursue a relationship with Nicole, and Sami was accused of murder.|$|E
500|$|Susie Wiles, who ran Rick Scott's {{successful}} 2010 gubernatorial {{campaign in}} Florida, worked first {{as executive director}} of H-PAC and then as Huntsman's campaign manager. Her appointment dovetailed with Huntsman's strategic emphasis on winning the early Florida primary. She resigned on July 21, 2011, stating, [...] "I signed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it started. It’s like a phase. This morning I said it’s time to move on." [...] She went on to explain that she had never intended to stay on with the campaign indefinitely, but instead had plans [...] "to resume [...] life and get home." [...] Wiles stated her intention to continue to be a [...] "friend and confidante of Huntsman."

500|$|The song [...] "Aagadu" [...] {{was filmed}} on Mahesh and few dancers at the Jindal Steel Factory, Bellary in October 2013. This {{became the first}} Telugu film to be shot there and also made the factory a notable {{location}} for the song shoots of Kannada films such as Rana Vikrama (2015), Ranna (2015), and Mr. Airavata (2015). Both the song and fight sequences were filmed in 23 days. Mahesh {{and the members of}} the film's unit had fallen sick and continued work using antibiotics. Mahesh called it the [...] "most strenuous schedule I went through in my life", and added, [...] "For every shot, they had to get the dust <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the right visual.

500|$|English {{also makes}} {{frequent}} use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs, verb phrases that {{are made up of}} a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are to get up, to ask out, to back up, to give <b>up,</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> together, to hang out, to put up with, etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. lay off meaning terminate someone's employment). In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including , do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term [...] "phrasal verb". Instead they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. he {{woke up in the morning}} and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Sesame Street, which {{tested a}} third of its episodes, the Blue's Clues {{research}} team field tested every episode three times with children aged between two to six in preschool environments such as Head Start programs, public schools, and private day care centers. There were three phases of testing: content evaluation, video evaluations, and content analysis. In their tests of the pilot, conducted throughout the New York City area with over 100 children aged from three to seven, the show was [...] "immediately successful." [...] They found that as the pilot progressed, children's attention was not only captured and sustained, but they became excited and actively participated with what they saw, {{to the point that they}} stood <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> closer to the television and spoke back to the host. The producers and researchers also consulted outside advisers, who were chosen based on their expertise and the needs of each script. As Anderson stated, the formative research team served [...] "as a liaison between the feedback provided by the preschoolers and outside advisers and the production team, including writers, talent, producers, directors, element artists, and animators." ...|$|E
