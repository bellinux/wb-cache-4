25|$|The minbar, {{situated}} {{on the right of}} the mihrab, is used by the imam during the Friday or Eids sermons, is a staircase-shaped pulpit with an <b>upper</b> <b>seat,</b> reached by eleven steps, and measuring 3.93 meters length to 3.31 meters in height. Dated from the ninth century (about 862) and erected under the reign of the sixth Aghlabid ruler Abul Ibrahim (856-863), it is made in teak wood imported from India. Among all the pulpits of the Muslim world, it is certainly the oldest example of minbar still preserved today. Probably made by cabinetmakers of Kairouan (some researchers also refer to Baghdad), it consists of an assembly of more than 300 finely carved wood pieces with an exceptional ornamental wealth (vegetal and geometric patterns refer to the Umayyad and Abbasid models), among which about 90 rectangular panels carved with plenty of pine cones, grape leaves, thin and flexible stems, lanceolate fruits and various geometric shapes (squares, diamonds, stars, etc.). The upper edge of the minbar ramp is adorned with a rich and graceful vegetal decoration composed of alternately arranged foliated scrolls, each one containing a spread vine-leaf and a cluster of grapes. In the early twentieth century, the minbar had a painstaking restoration. Although more than eleven centuries of existence, all panels, with the exception of nine, are originals and are in a good state of conservation, the fineness of the execution of the minbar makes it a great masterpiece of Islamic wood carving referring to Paul Sebag. This old chair of the ninth century is still in its original location, next to the mihrab.|$|E

5000|$|The folding {{mechanism}} is extremely simple, {{which accounts for}} the fact that the Picnica was marketed as the [...] "One-touch Picnica" [...] (Japanese: ワンタッチピクニカ). In a review, the Picnica folding mechanism was described as a [...] "case of the frame collapsing backwards on itself, with the handlebars and seat post falling to the top of the rear wheel. To this end, the main part of the frame is a quadrilateral with a pivot at each corner, and a rear triangle made collapsible by hinged seat stays. It's those seat stays that hold everything in place. In the riding position they're straight and rigid, as on any bike. The upper part of each seat stay is locked in a retaining channel by spring pressure; squeeze the <b>upper</b> <b>seat</b> stays inwards and they pop out of their channels, and the hinge 'unlocks'. The upper and lower seat stays then fold over as the main frame folds - the whole bike collapses under its own weight." ...|$|E

40|$|Keywords- cock valve, failure analysis, {{mechanical}} analysis, finite element, {{flow field}} calculation Abstract. Though statistically analyzing ten typical wells of kelly cock valve failure in certain oilfields, the main failure modes of the kelly cock valve were determined. Aiming at these modes and combining with mechanical analysis of knob, <b>upper</b> <b>seat</b> and {{main body of}} the kelly cock valve, its finite element calculation had been implemented and the weakness of all parts was found. By numerical modeling of the flow field of a kelly cock valve {{it was found that the}} velocity of fluid rapidly increased at upper and lower valve seats and this could easily prick out ball valves and valve seats, there was a annular low-velocity zone of minimum speed between the ball valve and the inner wall of the main body and this caused solid aggregation at this area. The research in this paper made the modes and causes of kelly failure to be recognized systematically. The results provided theoretical foundations of further improving the design and reasonable using of a kelly cock valve...|$|E
30|$|The {{ritual of}} mukrabu is mainly {{implemented}} {{in the living room}} (“Zimi” in the Na’s language): the Daba sits at the <b>upper</b> <b>seat</b> of the fireplace and faces with the front door. There are objects that represent the gods (e.g., dhu and sé) in the left, including the statues (“niamu”) made of flour and butter, a wooden statue representing dhu, and tree branches and swords representing the weapons of gods. A large number of statues representing the malefic spirits are put in the right. The most dangerous malefic spirits (e.g., mukra) is imprisoned in a wooden “cage” (“diZi” in the Na’s language) which has been made in advance. The Na believe that the according positions of gods and malefic spirits (two sides of the fireplace) stand for the “upper” (“ge”) and the “bottom” (“mu”). After killing the cock, the assistants offer the heart, one piece of bone, and blood to the gods sitting “above,” and feathers, claws, viscera, and apexes of the wing to the malefic spirits sitting “at bottom.” The meat is boiled then ate by attendees (including the Daba and the assistants).|$|E

40|$|Here are {{researches}} {{made into}} {{the composition of}} the music found in each of the religious services, Reijisaho, Kai, and Kazutori-Sange displayed {{on the occasion of the}} Shunie. Reijisaho is a service offered to the Iand of the Blessed, which takes place in the room for rituals, Reiji-no-ma, situated in the south-western corner of the Hall, every day at the falling of the dark. On the first day, however, it comes immediately after the rites at the Sojinsho. The time required for the service is less than five minutes. Chanting services, such as Shibujo, Dokyo (Amidakyo), Gobai, Sanjo-shakujo, and Amidasan, are presided over by the Shushi, officiating priest, Each of the chants is considerably clear in its beginning, but its later part and some other sutras are dealt with in rather rapid tones or what is called mokusho, which means chanting in mind. Pilgrim's staves, shakujo, are used without ceasing in the course of the service chanting. Kai, trumpet-shell blowing, which follows Shoya, Goya, Kekasaho, and Kigansaho, helps to create an atmosphere appropriate to the occasion of inviting the gods, and it is the only scene that renders one hear the genuine sound of the trumpet-shells. The performance comes to its climax when the trumpet-shells are sounded in concert, With the tunes of Kotaka and Ogiri blown respectively at the south seat, Nanza, and the north seat, Kitaza, in the inner temple. The variation of tones, which comes at the turning point from the early-evening period, Shoya, to the late-hour period, Goya, is worthy of notice as well. The ritual of Kazutori-Sange is held following the rituals in the daytime, four times during the Shunie [...] on 5 th, 7 th, 12 th, and 14 th of March. Next to the rites for Sange or atonement, Shidai-Sange, executed by common priests, Hirashu, three priests at the <b>upper</b> <b>seat</b> make what is called Senrei, one thousand bows, the four seated in front of the altar Nisenrei, two thousand bows, and the three in the house for prayer, Raido, Sanzenrei, three thousand bows respectively in accordance with the indications by the the Tsukasa, who presides over the rite. After that the grand officiating priest, Daidoshi, offers a prayer to the gods. This ritual, one of the most important services, which is executed on the four days, has a particular significance. The ritual Hashiri meaning 'running' is held on the last three days of the first seven days, Johichinichi, and of the latter seven days, Gehichinichi, after the midnight recess. This service, as well as the Dattan, exhibits exceedingly active and dynamic scenes. In the beginning of the ritual all of the priests go the rounds of the inner temple with wooden clogs called sashikake on, praying all the while. Then each of the three at the <b>upper</b> <b>seat</b> goes out by turns into the Raido, and sfter stooping down with his right knee on a board shaped like a spring board flings himself against the wooden floor again and again for atonement before going back to his own seat. The other eight, leaving the clogs behind one after another, gradually quicken their steps into running, go out into the Raido, and follow in the footsteps of the three by turns. After that they return to theie seats. Thus the last one is required to keep running and make more than fifty circuits to wait for his turn. The austerities being over, each of the ascetics is treated by the Tsukasa to a bit of Kozui, sacred water drawn from the Well of Wakasa for the offering to the altar. Beautiful is the melody of the priests' chants returning thanks to the gods, "Namu Saijo...|$|E
