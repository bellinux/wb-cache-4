25|$|After distillation, the <b>unaged</b> brandy {{is placed}} into oak barrels to mature. Usually, brandies {{with a natural}} golden or brown colour are aged in oak casks (single-barrel aging). Some brandies, {{particularly}} those from Spain, are aged using the solera system, where the producer changes the barrel each year. After a period of aging, which depends on the style, class and legal requirements, the mature brandy is mixed with distilled water to reduce alcohol concentration and bottled. Some brandies have caramel colour and sugar added to simulate the appearance of barrel aging.|$|E
25|$|These {{types of}} American whiskey must be {{distilled}} {{to no more}} than 80% alcohol by volume, and barrelled at no more than 125 proof. Only water may be added to the final product; the addition of colouring or flavouring is prohibited. These whiskeys must be aged in new charred-oak containers, except for corn whiskey which {{does not have to be}} aged. If it is aged, it must be in uncharred oak barrels or in used barrels. Corn whiskey is usually <b>unaged</b> and sold as a legal version of moonshine.|$|E

25|$|The mash {{is allowed}} to ferment, the {{resulting}} liquid collected and distilled in either clay or copper pots which will further modify {{the flavor of the}} final product. The distilled product is then bottled and sold. <b>Unaged</b> mezcal is referred to as joven, or young. Some of the distilled product is left to age in barrels between one month and four years, but some can be aged for as long as 12 years. Mezcal can reach an alcohol content of 55%. Like tequila, mezcal is distilled twice. The first distillation is known as punta, and comes out at around 75 proof (37.5% alcohol by volume). The liquid must then be distilled a second time to raise the alcohol percentage.|$|E

By law, all Scotch whisky must be aged {{for a minimum}} of three years in oak casks, though many single malts are matured for much longer.

During the time it spends in the wood, a significant percentage of each cask's content will evaporate. The lost product is known as the angel's share.|$|E

While <b>unaged</b> and unprocessed, Máochá pǔ'ěr is similar to green tea. Two subtle differences worth noting are that pǔ'ěr is not produced from the small-leaf Chinese varietal but the broad-leaf varietal mostly found in the southern Chinese provinces and India. The second is that pǔ'ěr leaves are picked as one bud and 3-4 leaves whilst green tea is picked as one bud and 1-2 leaves. This means that older leaves contribute to the qualities of pǔ'ěr tea.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the most}} notable members of the Muscat family are Muscat blanc à Petits Grains, which is the primary grape variety used in the {{production}} of the Italian sparkling wine Asti (also known as Moscato Asti) made in the Piedmont region. It is also used {{in the production of}} many of the French fortified wines known as vin doux naturels. In Australia, this is also the main grape used in the production of Liqueur Muscat, from the Victorian wine region of Rutherglen. Young, <b>unaged</b> and unfortified examples of Muscat blanc tend to exhibit the characteristic Muscat [...] "grapey" [...] aroma as well as citrus, rose and peach notes. Fortified and aged examples (particularly those that have been barrel aged) tend to be very dark in color due to oxidation with aroma notes of coffee, fruit cake, raisins and toffee.|$|E
2500|$|The History of Conecuh Ridge Whiskey {{begins with}} Clyde May, a legendary Alabama moonshiner and bootlegger. From the 1950s to the 1980s Clyde managed to produce around 300 gallons {{a week in}} a still of his own design in the woods near Almeria, Alabama in Bullock County, {{southeast}} of Montgomery. His product was known for its high quality relative to typical moonshine. According to his son, Kenny, the reason was his painstaking insistence on using the best equipment he could fabricate and taking extra steps during production to maintain the purity and quality of the product. While much of it was sold, <b>unaged,</b> as corn liquor, a certain amount would be casked in charred barrels with a couple of dried apples for flavor. This would be aged for about one year. Clyde claimed that the hot Alabama summers accelerated the effect of aging, requiring only one year instead of the minimum of two given to Kentucky Bourbons. This would be bottled and given to friends and valued customers as [...] "Christmas Whiskey". Always operating outside the state liquor laws, Clyde May served an 18-month sentence at Maxwell Air Force Base in 1973. He gave up his cell to the man who convicted him, Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who was convicted in 1974 on charges from the Watergate scandal.|$|E
2500|$|Most “fresh” cheeses, unlike aged cheeses {{held for}} weeks or months, are aged for only days. This is {{not enough time to}} change the pH of the cheese to kill any harmful {{bacteria}} that may have been in the (unpasteurized) milk {{at the beginning of the}} process. The use of raw milk has led to a number of instances of food-borne disease linked to cheese, especially <b>unaged,</b> “fresh” cheeses. Cases of tuberculosis, listeriosis, and other diseases linked to cheese made in Mexico have led to strong restrictions against bringing the same across the US border or along with air travelers entering US airports. The most problematic cheeses have been panela, asadero, queso blanco, and ranchero, as these are not aged and are often made with unpasteurized milk. In 2008, the Diario [...] de la Federacion published the Norma [...] Mexicana project, with one of its purposes being the better sanitary control of the cheeses produced in the country. One of its major provisions is the prohibition against cheeses made with raw milk. However, critics state pasteurization is not the only way to guard against food-borne illnesses, and the process kills beneficial bacteria that affect the cheeses’ taste and health benefits of the cheese with the loss of live culture and enzymes. This is especially true of aged cheeses.|$|E
