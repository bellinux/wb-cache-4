Even discounting the oddities of hair growth patterns in the head of some marmosets, sakis and sakiwinkis from South America, all adult species of <b>uacaris</b> are completely bald. A close look at the head of these animals shows that the bald scalp is covered with short hairs of small diameter. An identical situation occurs in the stump-tailed macaque (Macaca speciosa); the scalp of young stump-tails is covered with hair down to the eyebrows. Beginning in adolescence, the forehead becomes gradually "naked " and adult animals have a high, apparently glabrous forehead. Actually, the number of very small hairs on these bald areas is the same as in the haired comparable areas of young animals. The population of hair follicles, then, is not reduced in nuâ€¢nbers but the follicles are much smaller and produce very small hairs. With the diminution in size of the hair follicles, there is a substantial increase {{in the size of the}} accompanying sebaceous glands. Such a pattern of development of alopecia is identical with what takes place in some young adult men. Additional evidences of baldness occur in the orangutan, which, like the stump-tailed macaque, attains a naked forehead as it matures. Inspections of many chimpanzees of all ages also reveal varying degrees of alopecia in a triangle of forehead just above the brows; this appears in adolescent animals and becomes prominent only in some adult animals. These observations point out that human alopecia has some phylogenetic significance and is not to be considered a disorder or disease...|$|E
