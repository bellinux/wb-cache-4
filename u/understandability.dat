25|$|Maintainability {{includes}} {{concepts of}} modularity, <b>understandability,</b> changeability, testability, reusability, and transferability from one development team to another. These {{do not take}} the form of critical issues at the code level. Rather, poor maintainability is typically the result of thousands of minor violations with best practices in documentation, complexity avoidance strategy, and basic programming practices that make the difference between clean and easy-to-read code vs. unorganized and difficult-to-read code.|$|E
25|$|In the German literature, an {{alternate}} term for vacant niches has found some acceptance. It {{is that of}} “freie ökologische Lizens” (free ecological license) (Sudhaus und Rehfeld 1992). It {{has been argued that}} this conceptualization has a disadvantage in that it does not convey immediately and easily what is meant, furthermore the concept does not correspond exactly to the term vacant niche. The usefulness of a term should be assessed {{on the basis of its}} <b>understandability</b> and on its capacity to promote future research. The term vacant niche appears to fulfill these requirements.|$|E
25|$|Interslavic can be {{classified}} as a semi-artificial language. It is essentially a modern continuation of Old Church Slavonic, but also draws on the various improvised language forms Slavs have been using for centuries to communicate with Slavs of other nationalities, for example in multi-Slavic environments and on the Internet, providing them with a scientific base. Thus, both grammar and vocabulary {{are based on the}} commonalities between the Slavic languages, and artificial elements are avoided. Its main focus lies on instant <b>understandability</b> rather than easy learning, a balance typical for naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) languages.|$|E
500|$|The {{commercial}} {{success of the}} series was in part because each painting {{is considered to be}} a model of understandable art by the general public. The success of Rockwell's depictions was due to his use of long-standing American cultural values about unity and respect of certain institutions while using symbols that enabled a broad audience to identify with his images. This <b>understandability</b> made it one extreme on the scale of artistic complexity when comparing the series to contemporaneous art. [...] It was diametrically opposed to abstract art and far removed from the intrigue of surrealism.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} of {{a recording}} noted the work's [...] "quasi-symphonic sequence" [...] and its [...] "balanced overall shape which brings musical satisfaction {{even though the}} choral-orchestral presentation is at times somewhat unrelenting". Eidenbenz noted that Reger achieved a direct expressivity of smallest entities of material (""), and saw in this [...] "atomization" [...] and relentless modulation a modern radicality (""). He then describes: [...] "" [...] (Expressivity instead of <b>understandability,</b> the intention of a shock wave making the audience a relief, relentless modulation, external opulence and inner calculated logic, the naive and unquestioned naturalness of his music) and noted how these elements also characterize Reger's life.|$|E
2500|$|Most importantly, since [...] is {{an exact}} phonemic {{transcription}} of the spoken language, its <b>understandability</b> {{is as high}} or higher than a normal conversation.|$|E
2500|$|A {{drawing of}} a graph or network diagram is a {{pictorial}} representation of the vertices and edges of a graph. This drawing {{should not be confused}} with the graph itself: very different layouts can correspond to the same graph. [...] In the abstract, all that matters is which pairs of vertices are connected by edges. [...] In the concrete, however, the arrangement of these vertices and edges within a drawing affects its <b>understandability,</b> usability, fabrication cost, and aesthetics. The problem gets worse, if the graph changes over time by adding and deleting edges (dynamic graph drawing) and the goal is to preserve the user's mental map.|$|E
50|$|Traffic sign {{comprehension}} and <b>understandability</b> are higher when the signs comply with ergonomic principles. It is recommended {{to follow the}} below principles {{in order to increase}} driver {{comprehension and}} <b>understandability.</b>|$|E

50|$|Jürgen Habermas in {{his theory}} of {{communicative}} action developed four validity claims (truth, sincerity, appropriateness and <b>understandability)</b> leading to credibility. In a study researchers empirically validated the claims and derived a two-phase model of (reporting-) credibility, where first of all <b>understandability</b> needs to be reached. Only then the three other validity claims make a difference and may lead to credibility in the Habermasian sense.|$|E
5000|$|Patient's ready <b>understandability</b> of {{panoramic}} films, {{making them}} a useful visual aid in patient education and case presentation.|$|E
50|$|The {{sense of}} {{coherence}} with its three components meaningfulness, manageability and <b>understandability</b> {{has also been}} applied to the workplace.|$|E
50|$|Authors (Cardoso, Mendling, Neuman and Reijers, 2006) used {{complexity}} metrics {{to measure}} the simplicity and <b>understandability</b> of a design. This is supported by later research done by Mendling et al. who argued that without using the quality metrics to help question quality properties of a model, simple process can be modeled in a complex and unsuitable way. This in turn {{can lead to a}} lower <b>understandability,</b> higher maintenance cost and perhaps inefficient execution of the process in question.|$|E
50|$|John C. Lilly {{worked on}} {{teaching}} dolphins English (successful with rhythms, not with <b>understandability,</b> given their different mouth/blowhole shapes) and identifying whether extraterrestrial signals contain communication.|$|E
50|$|Qoob’s {{interface}} adheres modern {{requirements of}} the quality of UI, users’ needs of <b>understandability</b> and intuitiveness. It includes common features, commands and tools needed for building sites.|$|E
50|$|Foundation for Open Project Documentation gives {{a project}} a greater <b>understandability</b> and {{re-usability}} potential, than Open Source foundation. It is loosely connected with Free Software Foundation. OpenDoc project {{can also be}} commercial.|$|E
50|$|Many {{factors have}} an effect on the {{comprehension}} of idioms. They can influence the processing speed and <b>understandability</b> of the idioms. Some of these factors include the familiarity, transparency, and context of use of the idioms.|$|E
5000|$|Formal {{equivalence}} translation (sometimes {{literal translation}} or formal correspondence) {{in which the}} greatest effort is made to preserve the meaning of individual words and phrases in the original, with relatively less regard for its <b>understandability</b> by modern readers.|$|E
50|$|MyPlate {{was widely}} {{received}} as an improvement {{on the previous}} MyPyramid icon, which had been criticized as too abstract and confusing. The 50-percent emphasis on fruits and vegetables, {{as well as the}} simplicity and <b>understandability</b> of the plate image, were particularly praised.|$|E
5000|$|These {{technological}} initiatives {{were widely}} supported, with one observer noting that Cox [...] "earned virtually universal plaudits for efforts to modernize technology, transparency, and <b>understandability</b> of corporate reports, {{and to provide}} for apples-to-apples comparisons (for the first time ever) of corporate executive compensation." ...|$|E
5000|$|Improvement and {{guarantee}} of quality: As a standardized process model, the V-Model {{ensures that the}} results to be provided are complete and have the desired quality. Defined interim results can be checked at an early stage. Uniform product contents will improve readability, <b>understandability</b> and verifiability.|$|E
50|$|Jackson criticises the {{traditional}} version, claiming that it hides the relationships which {{exist between the}} input lines, compromising the program's <b>understandability</b> and maintainability by, for example, forcing {{the use of a}} special case for the first line and forcing another special case for a final output operation.|$|E
50|$|Calcium and {{magnesium}} ions present as sulfates, chlorides, carbonates and bicarbonates cause water to be hard. Water chemists measure water impurities in {{parts per million}} (ppm). For <b>understandability,</b> hardness ordinarily is expressed in grains of hardness per gallon of water (gpg). The two systems can be converted mathematically.|$|E
50|$|When using a {{revision}} control systems a common convention {{is to use}} small commits. These are {{sometimes referred to as}} atomic commits as they (ideally) only affect a single aspect of the system. These atomic commits allow for greater <b>understandability,</b> less effort to roll back changes, easier bug identification.|$|E
50|$|The Coleman-Liau {{index is}} a {{readability}} test designed by Meri Coleman and T. L. Liau {{to gauge the}} <b>understandability</b> of a text. Like the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning fog index, SMOG index, and Automated Readability Index, its output approximates the U.S. grade level thought necessary to comprehend the text.|$|E
50|$|The {{automated}} readability index (ARI) is a readability {{test for}} English texts, designed {{to gauge the}} <b>understandability</b> of a text. Like the Flesch-Kincaid grade level, Gunning fog index, SMOG index, Fry readability formula, and Coleman-Liau index, it produces an approximate representation of the US grade level needed to comprehend the text.|$|E
50|$|As an example, {{consider}} a strictly layered system, where each layer can only use {{services provided by}} the layer immediately below it. Any source code component that does not observe this constraint represents an architecture violation. If not corrected, such violations can transform the architecture into a monolithic block, with adverse effects on <b>understandability,</b> maintainability, and evolvability.|$|E
50|$|Cohesion is an ordinal type of {{measurement}} and is usually described as “high cohesion” or “low cohesion”. Modules with high cohesion tend to be preferable, because high cohesion is associated with several desirable traits of software including robustness, reliability, reusability, and <b>understandability.</b> In contrast, low cohesion is associated with undesirable traits such as being difficult to maintain, test, reuse, or even understand.|$|E
50|$|As Satie {{apparently}} did not foresee an enacted or scenic representation, and also while he disconnected the male roles (according to the text) from the female voice(s) delivering these texts, keeping in mind a good <b>understandability</b> of the story exclusively by {{the words of the}} text, the form of the composition could rather be considered as (secular) oratorio, than opera, or (melo)drama (or symphony).|$|E
50|$|Lhoták's {{style was}} {{significantly}} influenced by poetry, and especially by {{the works of}} Czech poets Jan Hanč and Ivan Blatný, fellow members of Group 42. During the years he adapted his style to various modern trends, {{but he managed to}} maintain his originality and specific artistic expression. He intentionally used some elements of naïve art and his works are well received for their directness and <b>understandability.</b>|$|E

She also started Stanford's explanation effort,called Inference Web, that aims to provide infrastructure for improving trust and <b>understandability</b> of answers in distributed environments, such as the web. She is co-author of the Proof Markup Language (PML) for representing knowledge provenance.|$|E
5000|$|Although threads {{seem to be}} a {{small step}} from {{sequential}} computation, in fact, they represent a huge step. They discard the most essential and appealing properties of sequential computation: <b>understandability,</b> predictability, and determinism. Threads, as a model of computation, are wildly non-deterministic, and the job of the programmer becomes one of pruning that nondeterminism. [...] The Problem with Threads, Edward A. Lee, UC Berkeley, 2006 ...|$|E
50|$|According to Flor (1991), Scenario Construction and Analysis {{could be}} used in {{analysing}} communication policy. Scenario is a description technique that has been attracting a lot of attention from practitioners and from researchers. Several disciplines have been using scenarios for some time now, but recently the information system community has dedicated special attention to the possibilities that this description technique provides to enhance <b>understandability</b> of task-related descriptions and communicability among stakeholders.|$|E

5000|$|In another sense, {{the word}} [...] "meaning" [...] {{can be used}} to {{describe}} the internal workings of the mind, independently of any linguistic activity. This sort of meaning is deeply psychological. If we look for other uses we can find intent, feeling, implication, importance, value, and signification. Since the negative form-- [...] "meaningless"—challenges and would deny these uses, experts believe that underlying them all are understanding and <b>understandability.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Understandability.</b> Compared to the {{normalized}} model, the dimensional {{model is}} easier to understand and more intuitive. In dimensional models, information is grouped into coherent business categories or dimensions, {{making it easier to}} read and interpret. Simplicity also allows software to navigate databases efficiently. In normalized models, data is divided into many discrete entities and even a simple business process might result in dozens of tables joined together in a complex way.|$|E
